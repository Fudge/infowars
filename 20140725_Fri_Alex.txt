[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.320 --> 00:21.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.080 --> 00:28.160]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'll be your host today on the show
[00:28.160 --> 00:32.600]  and we're going to have Paul Craig Roberts joining us in the second hour we're
[00:32.600 --> 00:35.780]  going to be talking about some recent developments in the Ukraine and in case
[00:35.780 --> 00:40.640]  you haven't heard the Ukrainian Prime Minister has resigned along with most of
[00:40.640 --> 00:45.240]  his supporting crew there that raises some interesting questions when
[00:45.240 --> 00:48.520]  governments are in a lot of trouble as they obviously were because their
[00:48.520 --> 00:53.360]  coalition fell apart what would a government in trouble resort to well
[00:53.360 --> 00:57.000]  we're going to talk to Paul Craig Roberts he has an idea about what they
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.080]  might do I have an idea I think maybe you have an idea as well we're going to
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.160]  explore that of course there's ongoing information about the escalating
[01:06.160 --> 01:12.160]  border crisis of course Obama is not content with just incentivizing people
[01:12.160 --> 01:16.640]  to recklessly endanger their children and bring them here or send them here
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.960]  but he is now talking to leaders from Central American countries and there is
[01:21.960 --> 01:26.200]  they've been reported from the Daily Mail as well as the Washington Post many
[01:26.200 --> 01:31.080]  other sources that he is considering that we're going to go down to Honduras
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.760]  and we're going to start processing children there and shipping them into
[01:35.760 --> 01:40.880]  the United States because they can't get the kids in quickly enough and of
[01:40.880 --> 01:45.640]  course there's some other information about parenting and how the government
[01:45.640 --> 01:48.560]  views parents and how they would like to replace parents you know we have a
[01:48.560 --> 01:54.640]  brave new world coming up we have a government that is funding research to
[01:54.640 --> 01:58.560]  essentially put robots with children because you know they need their own
[01:58.560 --> 02:02.960]  personal trainers they need these robots deployed is that's their terminology
[02:02.960 --> 02:06.320]  from a Yale study that they're going to put in there of course they're saying
[02:06.320 --> 02:10.560]  they're not going to replace humans no they're not right that's not the goal
[02:10.560 --> 02:15.520]  that's always been the goal of governments to replace parents they try to
[02:15.520 --> 02:20.040]  do it as much as they can in as many ways as they can of course going back to
[02:20.040 --> 02:24.960]  Aristotle and Plato they wanted to make sure that children didn't even know who
[02:24.960 --> 02:28.840]  their parents were so the kids only loyalty was to the state and of course
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.640]  one of the things that they want to have these robots help their children with
[02:33.640 --> 02:37.000]  is teaching them English as a second language that kind of tips their hand a
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.720]  little bit doesn't it I've been saying all along that a large part of why they
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.800]  want to bring younger children in is because they want to make sure that if
[02:47.800 --> 02:51.520]  they don't have any parents truly don't have any parents or if they've only got
[02:51.520 --> 02:55.880]  a single mother that the government is going to be the main influence on them
[02:55.880 --> 02:59.200]  they're going to treat them very well initially they're going to provide them
[02:59.200 --> 03:03.520]  lavishly with schools or I should say you and I will provide them with that we
[03:03.520 --> 03:09.000]  already see in New York they say that 10% of the schools now are have jumped up
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.680]  to being illegal immigrants how are the local governments going to be able to
[03:13.680 --> 03:19.400]  pay for the increased schools and that's as far as north as New York of course
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.280]  it is much worse and areas that are closer to the border so who's going to
[03:23.280 --> 03:30.080]  pay for all this well it turns out that we're looking to see the the bricks we
[03:30.080 --> 03:35.080]  had a report last night on the nightly news that one fellow believes that one
[03:35.080 --> 03:40.040]  of the reasons they were spying on Germany was because they want they were
[03:40.040 --> 03:43.680]  concerned that Germany is now going to join the bricks that's Brazil Russia
[03:43.680 --> 03:49.880]  India China and South America they're setting up their own IMF fund they're
[03:49.880 --> 03:53.440]  setting up their own banking system their own currency they want to remove
[03:53.440 --> 03:57.960]  themselves from the dollar dominance from the petro dollar from everything
[03:57.960 --> 04:01.880]  being priced in the dollar once that happens once people start moving out of
[04:01.880 --> 04:06.120]  our currency it's going to create a crushing economic depression that's
[04:06.120 --> 04:09.920]  another thing we'll talk to dr. Paul Craig Roberts about mainly when I talk
[04:09.920 --> 04:13.520]  to him about the Ukraine but I want to get his take on that as well the move
[04:13.520 --> 04:20.200]  to bricks and what that spells for the American economy and of course they're
[04:20.200 --> 04:25.040]  going to double down with this massive expansion of the entitlement state and
[04:25.040 --> 04:31.240]  so we've also got some reports from we've got some reports from Joe Biggs
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.920]  it's down to the border a lot of things coming up today we've got news on many
[04:36.920 --> 04:42.200]  different front so check back with us we'll be right back after the sprake

[08:18.160 --> 08:22.840]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Friday July 25th
[08:22.840 --> 08:28.080]  2014 we've got a lot of news to cover today we've got Paul Craig Roberts gonna
[08:28.080 --> 08:31.880]  be joining us in the second hour he's got an article up on infowars.com
[08:31.880 --> 08:36.400]  Washington is escalating the orchestrated Ukrainian crisis to a war
[08:36.400 --> 08:40.800]  of course they keep talking about Russian aggression just keep repeating
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.160]  that phrase over and over again until everybody wants to go to war and of
[08:45.160 --> 08:49.760]  course the CNN poll that was released earlier this week shows that already CNN
[08:49.760 --> 08:55.200]  the mainstream media and the Washington drumbeat has gotten 10% of the people
[08:55.200 --> 08:59.880]  saying they're ready to go to war with Russia over what over the accidental
[08:59.880 --> 09:04.600]  shooting of a airliner going down of course that's happened before Ukraine
[09:04.600 --> 09:09.320]  actually shot down a Russian jetliner back in 2001 you may not have noticed
[09:09.320 --> 09:12.680]  that because it happened right after everything that happened in September 11th
[09:12.680 --> 09:16.960]  it was just in October the following month that they accidentally shot down a
[09:16.960 --> 09:23.920]  Russian passenger commercial airliner and it took them a long time to admit
[09:23.920 --> 09:27.200]  that they had actually done it but of course that's happened in the past we've
[09:27.200 --> 09:31.640]  done it in the past the US Navy accidentally shot down an Iranian
[09:31.640 --> 09:36.080]  passenger airliner so that sort of thing can happen it can also be a false
[09:36.080 --> 09:40.400]  flag and today we learn that the Ukrainian Prime Minister as well as most
[09:40.400 --> 09:44.240]  of his cabinet has resigned their coalition fell apart they were in
[09:44.240 --> 09:49.440]  trouble economically politically militarily in that very area if they're
[09:49.440 --> 09:52.880]  in trouble militarily if they're losing in that area if they're having their
[09:52.880 --> 09:55.720]  planes shot down and they're getting reversed in that area what would a
[09:55.720 --> 10:01.440]  government that is falling apart resort to well of course we know the answer to
[10:01.440 --> 10:05.360]  that and we're going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts later in the show and
[10:05.360 --> 10:09.000]  we got a couple of articles that are up on the drudge report today one of them
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.440]  from a Don Salazar illegal alien gang members have been arrested for the
[10:13.440 --> 10:19.320]  murder of a homeless man and this was MS 13 gang members this was a man Amos
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.560]  Milburn in Maryland a 56 year old homeless man he was hanging out with
[10:23.560 --> 10:26.440]  friends near liquor store when he confronted a girl they got into an
[10:26.440 --> 10:31.320]  argument the young woman got angry and left and then came back with several of
[10:31.320 --> 10:37.800]  her friends who now it turns out were MS 13 gang members now this female that he
[10:37.800 --> 10:43.040]  got into the argument with was actually 17 years old so according to MPR and
[10:43.040 --> 10:46.160]  according to the narrative that the administration is putting out there she
[10:46.160 --> 10:52.280]  was actually an unaccompanied child even though these people are part of MS 13
[10:52.280 --> 10:58.400]  and of course reported last week that there was a group of baby Zetas that
[10:58.400 --> 11:02.480]  were picked up that were in Central America still this was on a Spanish
[11:02.480 --> 11:08.680]  language feed the head of this gang of 10 baby Zetas was 16 years old his
[11:08.680 --> 11:14.800]  girlfriend ran it with them she was 13 years old so these 10 baby Zetas people
[11:14.800 --> 11:19.560]  like these MS 13 gang members who just beat this homeless man to death these
[11:19.560 --> 11:24.320]  are the unaccompanied minors and of course they're the kind of minors who
[11:24.320 --> 11:29.880]  could make that trip across Central America unaccompanied I don't think
[11:29.880 --> 11:33.800]  there's very many children and diapers who are capable of doing that not any
[11:33.800 --> 11:37.600]  real children as you and I would think of them elementary school aged children
[11:37.600 --> 11:41.200]  that are making that journey unaccompanied there's something else
[11:41.200 --> 11:44.920]  going on with this narrative but of course we keep hearing over and over
[11:44.920 --> 11:51.280]  again that it is strictly children that that's the only thing that we need to be
[11:51.280 --> 11:56.760]  concerned about is helping these children just yesterday Hillary Clinton was on a
[11:56.760 --> 12:00.160]  program called on point and she said you've got to remember that these kids
[12:00.160 --> 12:06.080]  that are coming across fall into just two types you know there's two types of
[12:06.080 --> 12:09.560]  people there's the people who break everybody into two types of people and
[12:09.560 --> 12:12.960]  those who don't well her two types of people were they were either migrants
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.040]  who are coming here to be reunited with their family of course their family
[12:17.040 --> 12:21.400]  isn't citizens then they're still illegal aliens but and then the other
[12:21.400 --> 12:26.560]  thing she said was their refugees from violence what she did not talk about was
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.440]  people who are actually coming here and bringing violence in who are bringing in
[12:31.440 --> 12:35.440]  these young gang members we've talked about that over and over again of course
[12:35.440 --> 12:40.080]  the media tries to avoid that as much as possible and as a don pointed out in
[12:40.080 --> 12:46.240]  this article you had to watch the video to even know that these people that beat
[12:46.240 --> 12:50.560]  this homeless man to death you had to watch the video to know that they were
[12:50.560 --> 12:55.680]  illegal immigrants they put it nowhere in the article they basically hit it
[12:55.680 --> 12:59.680]  just mentioned it very quickly that they were illegal immigrants now when I
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.880]  mentioned about that group of 10 baby Zetas where the leader was 16 years old
[13:04.880 --> 13:09.680]  and his girlfriend who co-led with him was 13 years old what they were doing
[13:09.680 --> 13:16.760]  was kidnapping people they would then videotape them being tortured and in the
[13:16.760 --> 13:21.680]  cases even after the people paid the ransom they videotaped themselves
[13:21.680 --> 13:26.840]  torturing mutilating and killing these people and not turning them over to the
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.640]  people who had paid the ransom these are the kinds of hardened criminals that
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.240]  are being imported in this country and of course now Obama is meeting with
[13:35.240 --> 13:41.920]  Central and South American presidents they're looking at having the American
[13:41.920 --> 13:47.480]  government go down to Honduras and essentially vet children there and
[13:47.480 --> 13:52.000]  essentially import them into this country so they don't have to make this
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.760]  dangerous journey this is a always you see the government doubling down
[13:58.760 --> 14:03.120]  certainly under Obama rather than correcting the problem he's going to go
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.360]  down there they built this narrative saying this is simply children who need
[14:07.360 --> 14:10.400]  to get out of violence this is the narrative that they've been repeating
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.800]  over and over and over again then when we have people like Glenn Betgo to the
[14:14.800 --> 14:19.760]  border and hand out teddy bears he's reinforcing that narrative that it is
[14:19.760 --> 14:24.040]  simply children and we just need to open our hearts and open our hands to them
[14:24.040 --> 14:30.000]  if you want to help them fine do it privately don't blow your horn and
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.240]  trumpet your good works in front of everybody because when you do that all
[14:34.240 --> 14:38.600]  you're doing is feeding this phony narrative that it's only children who
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.520]  are coming in now of course Obama is incentivizing it he's creating anchor
[14:43.520 --> 14:46.840]  babies he's well anchor babies have already been here he's created anchor
[14:46.840 --> 14:50.840]  teens essentially but he's creating actually anchor fetuses we were told
[14:50.840 --> 14:56.000]  and reported just last week that border patrol agents have been told that they
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.400]  are not to turn away any women who say that they are pregnant if they merely
[15:01.400 --> 15:04.720]  assert that they're pregnant they get a free pass into the country and of course
[15:04.720 --> 15:10.840]  they have no way to determine if they're pregnant or not now to contrast that to
[15:10.840 --> 15:16.800]  an amazing difference in the way that Americans are treated take a look at this
[15:16.800 --> 15:21.440]  journalist who went on a family vacation to Canada this is a journalist from
[15:21.440 --> 15:28.360]  Reason magazine his name is Roger van Bakel Bakel Bakel of Reason.com he went
[15:28.360 --> 15:32.840]  up into Canada after a vacation in Maine and as they were looking at his
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.680]  passports they asked him if he had a letter of permission for his children
[15:37.680 --> 15:43.480]  who also had passports to travel with him now while looking at this the first
[15:43.480 --> 15:47.960]  thing I remember was I had gone to Canada as a child I never had a passport
[15:47.960 --> 15:53.080]  and we didn't need passports to go back and forth on that border I remember in
[15:53.080 --> 15:56.880]  2002 after everybody started to get paranoid about everything after
[15:56.880 --> 16:01.520]  September 11th they started stepping up security obviously we still were able to
[16:01.520 --> 16:05.920]  take our children we had passports at the time our children had passports at
[16:05.920 --> 16:09.280]  the time because we had gone abroad but we didn't take them with us we didn't
[16:09.280 --> 16:12.880]  really think we needed them to go into Canada and the Canadian government
[16:12.880 --> 16:16.640]  didn't require it we were able to pass into Canada and just show them our
[16:16.640 --> 16:20.880]  driver's license and they looked at this and said fine you can go when we came
[16:20.880 --> 16:25.200]  back however we were treated like terrorist suspects we got the going
[16:25.200 --> 16:29.040]  over just like this guy did they almost didn't let us back in I didn't know at
[16:29.040 --> 16:34.000]  that point that they were requiring passports but this guy has been asked
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.760]  by the Border Patrol agents if he's got permission to travel and he kind of
[16:37.760 --> 16:42.080]  pushed back on that question and then they got angry he said I realized then
[16:42.080 --> 16:45.920]  that just a little bit of pushback was all these guys needed to get them going
[16:45.920 --> 16:49.800]  they pulled they got him out of the car they got very aggressive with him
[16:49.800 --> 16:53.480]  started searching his car and he says all right I'm gonna videotape this for
[16:53.480 --> 16:57.640]  my own protection when he did that they physically took it out of his hand and
[16:57.640 --> 17:01.360]  got very aggressive with him he says wait a minute as a journalist I can tell
[17:01.360 --> 17:05.640]  the world in writing whatever questions you're asking and he says in the US
[17:05.640 --> 17:09.080]  anybody has that right it's certainly not against the law what's the difference
[17:09.080 --> 17:14.080]  between that and recording the conversation now notice what the guy did
[17:14.080 --> 17:18.280]  he first of all he made him delete it or he wasn't gonna let him go but once he
[17:18.280 --> 17:24.800]  did delete the conversation he told him he could go we've seen that over and
[17:24.800 --> 17:29.360]  over and over again if the government is doing something that they don't have
[17:29.360 --> 17:34.240]  any legal authority to do if they're doing it under cover of law and you
[17:34.240 --> 17:40.480]  challenge them time and again they will let you go I want to point out many of
[17:40.480 --> 17:44.920]  you might have remembered the Ramaki family that's the German family who
[17:44.920 --> 17:49.560]  came here and got asylum in the United States because they were fleeing the
[17:49.560 --> 17:56.160]  German homeschooling laws you see in Germany they still have the anti-homeschooling
[17:56.160 --> 18:02.240]  laws that Adolf Hitler wrote Adolf Hitler wrote the first laws to criminalize
[18:02.240 --> 18:08.440]  education especially for parents to educate their own children those laws
[18:08.440 --> 18:14.000]  are still on the books and they're very rough with parents who want to to
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.240]  educate their children at home they get massive fines they have the children
[18:18.240 --> 18:21.720]  taken away from child protective services there was another German family
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.920]  who did not leave Germany they had their children taken away from by with child
[18:25.920 --> 18:29.840]  protection services because they wanted to homeschool they relented put the
[18:29.840 --> 18:34.160]  children in government school and the government still would not return
[18:34.160 --> 18:38.960]  custody of their children to the family so this family immigrated to the United
[18:38.960 --> 18:42.240]  States they sought asylum they were granted asylum by an immigration judge
[18:42.240 --> 18:46.480]  and everything seemed to be okay they said they were fleeing religious
[18:46.480 --> 18:51.240]  persecution they were homeschooling for religious reasons and then Eric Holder
[18:51.240 --> 18:56.160]  got involved and Eric Holder tried to overturn that immigration judges asylum
[18:56.160 --> 19:00.420]  order they took it all the way to the Supreme Court they decided they were
[19:00.420 --> 19:03.440]  going to fight and homeschool legal defense association represented them
[19:03.440 --> 19:07.280]  as they do most homeschoolers if you homeschool you really need to be a
[19:07.280 --> 19:10.560]  member of this organization they took it all the way to Supreme Court the
[19:10.560 --> 19:13.880]  Supreme Court said they weren't going to hear it and the next day Homeland
[19:13.880 --> 19:19.860]  Security said that's okay we're going to give you permission to stay here not
[19:19.860 --> 19:24.400]  any other German family is going to be allowed to stay here but just you and
[19:24.400 --> 19:28.360]  they set up some very troubling precedents in that Eric Holder said he
[19:28.360 --> 19:32.200]  didn't think denying people's right to homeschool their kids on religious
[19:32.200 --> 19:36.120]  grounds he didn't think that was a denial of religious freedoms of course they
[19:36.120 --> 19:39.960]  don't respect any of the First Amendment either freedom of religion or
[19:39.960 --> 19:44.360]  freedom of speech and you know what you can't have either of those if you don't
[19:44.360 --> 19:48.040]  have freedom of education we're going to be right back because I want you to
[19:48.040 --> 19:52.920]  understand how this applies this has happened over and over and over again if
[19:52.920 --> 19:57.520]  you fight them they might let you go but they're not going to change the law
[19:57.520 --> 20:01.360]  they will stop it before it gets to that point we'll be right back big business

[24:09.960 --> 24:14.200]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we were talking just
[24:14.200 --> 24:19.480]  before the break about this family that went into Canada and when they came back
[24:19.480 --> 24:23.320]  they were asked they had their passports but they were asked if they had
[24:23.320 --> 24:27.840]  permission to take their children with them and they're the guy who was
[24:27.840 --> 24:32.760]  actually a reporter for reason said do I need to have permission for my children
[24:32.760 --> 24:36.160]  and at that point they got kind of horsey with them they started to inspect
[24:36.160 --> 24:39.040]  their car and he says all right I'm going to record this for my own
[24:39.040 --> 24:44.360]  protection that then turned them violent and so they seized his phone they
[24:44.360 --> 24:49.080]  demanded that they were going to delete the the tape of the incident but he said
[24:49.080 --> 24:52.720]  hey I have the freedom to do this I can write about this I'm a journalist I can
[24:52.720 --> 24:55.840]  write about anything you say or do and it's the same principle of course it's
[24:55.840 --> 25:02.640]  been upheld over and over again that we do have a right to record this is under
[25:02.640 --> 25:08.200]  color of law illegal illegal actions and intimidation by government agents and we
[25:08.200 --> 25:12.520]  see this over and over again and we see that when you push back against them they
[25:12.520 --> 25:16.800]  let you go I was just talking about how the German family of course this
[25:16.800 --> 25:21.520]  highlights also the hypocrisy of what they're doing saying that they're trying
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.920]  to unite immigrant children with their parents who are in the states and yet
[25:25.920 --> 25:30.080]  they were going to send this family who was homeschooling for religious reasons
[25:30.080 --> 25:34.600]  back to Germany where the government was going to take the children away from
[25:34.600 --> 25:38.720]  the parents as they've done in the past as they fought it all the way the
[25:38.720 --> 25:42.600]  Supreme Court even when the Supreme Court said we're not going to hear it then
[25:42.600 --> 25:45.440]  they said all right you can you can keep them we've seen this happen over and
[25:45.440 --> 25:49.120]  over again look at John Corbett who challenged the TSA and then he got a
[25:49.120 --> 25:54.240]  pass to get on planes after that after he sued them multiple times we got Mark
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.200]  Baker Bakers Green Acres in Michigan he had all of his hogs taken away they
[25:59.200 --> 26:05.200]  said your hogs because you are free-range raising your hogs outside and they then
[26:05.200 --> 26:09.840]  grow hair he said these are feral hogs so we're going to take these away they're
[26:09.840 --> 26:14.960]  not like they don't look like the pigs that we have in the factory pork system
[26:14.960 --> 26:18.720]  so we're going to take them away he fought them for years and he would have
[26:18.720 --> 26:22.320]  been bankrupted except that he got contributions from other people but they
[26:22.320 --> 26:27.440]  took those breeds of pigs away from all of the other Michigan farmers but they
[26:27.440 --> 26:31.080]  eventually caved at the last minute after fighting him for three years after
[26:31.080 --> 26:36.320]  coming very close to bankrupting him for this legal fight they eventually at the
[26:36.320 --> 26:40.080]  last minute just backed off and said okay you're not going to be subject to
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.760]  these regulations but everybody else is so they leave the illegal law there they
[26:44.760 --> 26:48.080]  stop it at the court system they don't want it to go through they don't want to
[26:48.080 --> 26:51.440]  set a president they don't want to have the law overturned they just make
[26:51.440 --> 26:55.640]  exceptions for people who fight them we saw the same thing in the Bundy Ranch the
[26:55.640 --> 27:00.640]  BLM had already driven all of the other ranchers out of business just like the
[27:00.640 --> 27:05.160]  Michigan Department of Agriculture had driven out all these other free-range
[27:05.160 --> 27:08.560]  hog producers out of business and yet what do they do they just come back and
[27:08.560 --> 27:13.440]  say for you will make an exception but not for anybody else we're going to leave
[27:13.440 --> 27:20.320]  our illegal actions in place now Obama if you haven't heard is meeting with heads
[27:20.320 --> 27:25.800]  of Central American states and they are now looking at having children brought
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.160]  into this country we the American public the American government will fly
[27:30.160 --> 27:35.240]  children in from Honduras giving them refugee status but they will not give
[27:35.240 --> 27:41.000]  refugee status to a single family that comes here because they're going to have
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.760]  their children taken away with them from them if they educate them at home
[27:44.760 --> 27:50.200]  that's the kind of dichotomy we see we see that the government does not want
[27:50.200 --> 27:55.720]  people to have control over their children to that end they have come up
[27:55.720 --> 28:01.440]  with an idea they're actually given ten million dollars to Yale University to
[28:01.440 --> 28:05.720]  fund personal robot trainers for children and listen to the way they talk
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.040]  about this they talk about deploying these robots into homes that's actually
[28:10.040 --> 28:13.400]  their phrase I was up on the drudge report he highlighted that they're
[28:13.400 --> 28:17.240]  going to deploy these robots into homes and they're going to teach them
[28:17.240 --> 28:22.680]  English as a second language so that's a large part of why they want to import
[28:22.680 --> 28:26.600]  these young children they want to get them and they want to control them the
[28:26.600 --> 28:31.560]  government wants to get rid of parents wants to move them out of the way so
[28:31.560 --> 28:35.120]  that they can raise the children themselves they can't do that enough by
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.480]  extending the school year by extending the school hours so now they want to put
[28:39.480 --> 28:44.000]  robots into the homes listen to what the computer science professor at Yale
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.800]  University principal investigator for the study said he said just like a good
[28:47.800 --> 28:51.960]  personal trainer we want the robots to be able to guide the children toward a
[28:51.960 --> 28:57.120]  behavior that we desire who would that we be is that the parents or is that
[28:57.120 --> 29:00.920]  going to be the government setting those priorities he says the need for this
[29:00.920 --> 29:05.160]  technology is driven by critical societal problems that require sustained
[29:05.160 --> 29:10.080]  personalized support to supplement the efforts of educators parents and
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.240]  clinicians see they kind of put the parents in there in the middle and
[29:13.240 --> 29:18.040]  between the educators and the psychologists you know Melissa Harris
[29:18.040 --> 29:22.000]  Perry said you got to get over this idea that you own your own children know
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.240]  you don't you know well so what role do they see for parents I don't know
[29:25.240 --> 29:28.360]  because they're saying that they want these robots to help them learn better
[29:28.360 --> 29:33.960]  eating habits social cognitive skills so what is it that parents are supposed
[29:33.960 --> 29:38.720]  to do I don't know maybe they tuck them in at night it's it's not really clear
[29:38.720 --> 29:43.080]  but what is clear is they want to build a healthy relationship he says of trust
[29:43.080 --> 29:48.200]  and respect between the child and the robot not between the child and the
[29:48.200 --> 29:52.360]  parent we're on the mark Sarah Connor do we're gonna be right back run say what
[29:52.360 --> 29:56.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:56.840 --> 30:03.640]  city of Austin tap water versus filtered city of Austin tap water I didn't I
[30:03.640 --> 30:07.640]  taste dirt in it God knows what's in there these people just sampled city of

[30:20.560 --> 30:25.760]  tap water contains added substances like fluoride chlorine glyphosate and many
[30:25.760 --> 30:29.240]  others studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment
[30:29.240 --> 30:33.640]  of major health issues including tooth decay lower than IQ and even cancer it
[30:33.640 --> 30:36.360]  tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing top water the

[33:33.160 --> 33:35.760]  we want your soul
[33:35.760 --> 33:40.720]  What's going on in your life? What are you concerned about? What is the thing that you're
[33:40.720 --> 33:46.280]  most concerned about? As you see the American economy, the American rule of law being attacked
[33:46.280 --> 33:52.760]  on multiple fronts, that's coming up. We're going to have Paul Craig Roberts joining us
[33:52.760 --> 33:57.280]  at the next hour. We're going to be talking about what's going on in Ukraine. And of course,
[33:57.280 --> 34:02.160]  he was an economist in the regular administration. We'll be talking to him about the economic
[34:02.160 --> 34:09.000]  challenges that we're up against as well. You know, it's been two years since I came to
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.480]  Infowars and it's amazing to me to see how much it has changed. How many reporters we've hired,
[34:15.480 --> 34:21.360]  things like the new studio, we're trying to get the nightly news syndicated out to multiple
[34:21.360 --> 34:27.360]  television stations, the ability to be able to go out and cover things like the Bundy Ranch,
[34:27.360 --> 34:32.720]  like the Asymmetric Warfare Center. We've got reporters right now down at the border covering
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.240]  that showing you what the border looks like from both the air going through the border,
[34:37.240 --> 34:43.120]  taking a video camera, walking through the border. That's the sort of thing that we can only do with
[34:43.120 --> 34:48.000]  your help, with your support. And you've been very good about doing that. What we have decided to
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.840]  do here is, of course, we don't depend on the government to give us funding. What we've decided
[34:53.840 --> 34:59.080]  to do is to offer you primarily health products, because we know that there's a war on your health
[34:59.080 --> 35:04.600]  as well. So Alex has come up with a line of health products. We have subscriptions to the
[35:04.600 --> 35:10.760]  PrisonPlanet.tv. You can support us with that operation. But right now, we have some great
[35:10.760 --> 35:16.800]  specials. We've got the fluoride shield. That's a collating detox, a collating detox. It's 25%
[35:16.800 --> 35:22.120]  off of that. And if you get that in conjunction with the X2, which is selling out quickly,
[35:22.120 --> 35:29.560]  you can get that for 30% off. Now, that's something that has almost sold out. It took us a while to
[35:29.560 --> 35:35.640]  get silver bullet back in. It took us about two and a half months. It's a very difficult process
[35:35.640 --> 35:40.960]  to manufacture this. At the rate it's being sold, it'll probably sell out in about a week. And it's
[35:40.960 --> 35:45.560]  going to take us about a month to get that back in once it does sell out. But that's going to be
[35:45.560 --> 35:52.640]  available. That is available right now for $19.95. And also, we have some specials on super male
[35:52.640 --> 36:00.080]  and female vitality. That is getting rave reviews, something that you can do to help your health,
[36:00.080 --> 36:05.440]  to help your family's health, as well as support the operation. Again, that's fluoride shield.
[36:05.440 --> 36:12.960]  It's 25% off. If you get it with X2, you get 30% off of both of those. Now, as we were just talking
[36:12.960 --> 36:18.320]  before the break about the government doing things under the color of law, that they don't
[36:18.320 --> 36:26.200]  really have the authority to do this story out of a website called theorganicprepper.ca. This
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.040]  is the Michigan Department of Agriculture. And again, I mentioned that how they came down on
[36:30.040 --> 36:34.480]  the hog farmers, put all of them but one out of business. He fought them for years and nearly
[36:34.480 --> 36:39.320]  bankrupt him. And finally, they say, all right, you can keep them, but nobody else can have that
[36:39.320 --> 36:45.680]  particular type of pig. And of course, they maintained that they were a feral species because
[36:45.680 --> 36:49.280]  they had hair on them. Well, they had hair on them because he was looking for that kind of
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.560]  species because he had them free range instead of packing them into a small factory environment.
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.720]  But look what they did now to this food co-op. Michigan Department of Agriculture forces a
[36:58.720 --> 37:06.840]  farmer to dump 248 gallons of organic milk and break 1200 free range eggs. Now, it's not just
[37:06.840 --> 37:16.680]  busting the eggs. They watched them as they broke each individual egg. That's 100 dozen eggs. And
[37:16.680 --> 37:21.720]  they watched them break every single egg. And then they made them take this organic milk and
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.680]  spray it. And they watched that. They witnessed it to make sure that they were spraying it. They
[37:26.680 --> 37:34.080]  also destroyed an undisclosed amount of fresh cream, butter, and cheese. This is something
[37:34.080 --> 37:39.640]  we're seeing over and over again. And of course, what they said was, you don't have a license to
[37:39.640 --> 37:44.440]  sell this food. And they said, well, we're not selling it. We're not retelling it. We're a co-op.
[37:44.440 --> 37:51.800]  And they said, well, we don't like your paperwork. They asked, why is it that when they make real
[37:51.800 --> 37:59.440]  food on a real farm, why is that a crime? Why is fresh food being treated like it was crystal
[37:59.440 --> 38:06.080]  meth? That's the point they made. And of course, the reality is that just like raw milk, why they
[38:06.080 --> 38:13.480]  cracked down on raw milk, it was to protect the factory milk producers, big agra. They didn't want
[38:13.480 --> 38:18.840]  the competition of fresh organic milk. And so they started coming after them primarily in the
[38:18.840 --> 38:25.600]  states like Wisconsin, where they had a big dairy industry, but it's not just that. They don't want
[38:25.600 --> 38:32.200]  us to own anything. The large corporations don't want any competition. And one of the ways that you
[38:32.200 --> 38:37.360]  make sure you don't have any competition is to make sure that nobody else actually owns anything,
[38:37.360 --> 38:43.160]  has any property, has any businesses. We know how this has worked out when it's done to the
[38:43.160 --> 38:50.640]  extreme. Look at Hugo Chavez's Socialist Paradise of Venezuela. Bloomberg has pointed out multiple
[38:50.640 --> 38:56.000]  times and bragged about what a good investment Venezuela is for bondholders, how they've
[38:56.000 --> 39:04.280]  gotten over nearly 700%. I think it was 681%. Nearly 700% return on their investments. And you
[39:04.280 --> 39:09.520]  have bankers saying, this is great. They understand where their first priority is. Their first
[39:09.520 --> 39:16.080]  priority is their sovereign debt. Meanwhile, in the same article, they're pointing out that the
[39:16.080 --> 39:21.440]  people are having to go to other countries in order to get water, in order to get medicine,
[39:21.440 --> 39:26.640]  because they have taken everything from they've destroyed all private property. That's what
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.880]  socialism does. Communism and socialism on the bottom, but on the top, it's crony capitalism.
[39:32.880 --> 39:38.400]  That's what we're getting here. We're seeing small businesses, small farms being driven out of
[39:38.400 --> 39:45.480]  business so that the big agra big corporations, big banks have a total monopoly on what's going
[39:45.480 --> 39:51.200]  on. And it's not just there where they're going after illegal goods. There's also an article
[39:51.200 --> 39:58.320]  that comes out of truthandaction.org. New York Department of Homeland Security will pay you
[39:58.320 --> 40:06.320]  $500 to rat out your fellow citizens who are buying legal goods. They're not even trying to
[40:06.320 --> 40:12.320]  say that they are illegal. They're saying that these are things like they could use for survival,
[40:12.320 --> 40:19.400]  things like ammunition, MREs, that's meals ready to eat, flashlights, match containers, gas masks,
[40:19.400 --> 40:24.240]  and other things that they think might be something a prepper would use. So if you see
[40:24.240 --> 40:29.640]  somebody doing that, if you see something like that, you need to say something about that. You
[40:29.640 --> 40:36.840]  need to report people like that. You need to snitch on them. Here's the thing. When I was researching
[40:36.840 --> 40:43.760]  the asymmetric warfare center before Joe Biggs and I went there, I saw these people talking about
[40:43.760 --> 40:49.840]  the asymmetric warfare that they were conducting in Iraq at the time and talking about many different
[40:49.840 --> 40:54.720]  places where they had gone in. They said the way that you tell, and these are people, these are
[40:54.720 --> 40:58.320]  the generals who had fought there, they said the way that you tell whether our government is legitimate
[40:58.320 --> 41:06.480]  or not is based on the amount of force it needs to apply in order to stay in power. I think that
[41:06.480 --> 41:12.440]  applies here. We see that being escalated so much more as our government starts to get into so many
[41:12.440 --> 41:18.360]  different areas where they have no legitimate authority. And also, I think you could extend
[41:18.360 --> 41:23.560]  that and say that as the government becomes increasingly paranoid about its own citizens,
[41:23.560 --> 41:29.280]  it's up to something. It's not only not legitimate when it needs a lot of force to keep people in
[41:29.280 --> 41:34.560]  line, but when it is building force, you know that they've got something illegitimate down the
[41:34.560 --> 41:38.960]  pike that they're getting ready to do. There's another story we covered, the one from a Don
[41:38.960 --> 41:45.120]  Salazar that was linked to on the Drudge Report about these illegal alien gang members arrested
[41:45.120 --> 41:50.400]  for murder of a homeless man earlier. I want to play you the clip that was on the radio program.
[41:50.400 --> 41:56.840]  As we pointed out in the article, they didn't say that these were illegal aliens. They only
[41:56.840 --> 42:02.120]  mentioned it very quickly in the clip and you have to listen carefully for it because they
[42:02.120 --> 42:08.000]  don't use those terms, illegal aliens. They use the preferred term of the government, of the
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.440]  mainstream media, and that is undocumented immigrants. Here's that clip. 92-year-old Margie
[42:13.440 --> 42:19.360]  Hargrove says her heart has been broken by the murder of her grandson. A beautiful boy. He went
[42:19.360 --> 42:26.080]  bobbing nobody. Yet these six young people, ranging at age from 17 to 23, several of the
[42:26.080 --> 42:33.120]  members of the notorious MS-13 gang killed Jones early Tuesday morning along this stretch of Huron
[42:33.120 --> 42:38.600]  Avenue in Suitland. Investigators believe Jones said something offensive to the 17-year-old girl
[42:38.600 --> 42:45.360]  and she went to her fellow gang members for help. My mind is it's 601, yes, and we ultimately learn
[42:45.360 --> 42:52.120]  after all types that he has stabbed several times in the upper body, which causes death. The six
[42:52.120 --> 42:56.560]  young people, all undocumented immigrants, are charged with first-degree murder. The end result
[42:56.560 --> 43:01.640]  of a fight Margie Hargrove says Amos Jones wouldn't have started. If he'd never tried to pick a
[43:01.640 --> 43:08.920]  fight, he'd never bothered people enough for them to kill him. Well, the six young people charged in
[43:08.920 --> 43:14.800]  this case are all being held without bond. In Prince George's County, Brad Bell, ABC 7 News. The
[43:14.800 --> 43:19.240]  six young people who did that, of course, one of them, the lady who began the argument with the
[43:19.240 --> 43:24.240]  56-year-old homeless man that was beaten to death was, as reported earlier, 17 years old. That means
[43:24.240 --> 43:30.240]  that she is one of those children coming across the border. Turns out that there are also illegal
[43:30.240 --> 43:36.920]  aliens who are MS-13. Let's go to some of your calls here. Let's go to Joe in Pennsylvania. You
[43:36.920 --> 43:43.360]  wanted to say something about the immigration situation, Joe? Yeah, I got a lot to say. The
[43:43.360 --> 43:51.360]  whole thing, I think if people took a big step back and looked at the whole big picture, we are
[43:51.360 --> 43:56.720]  being infiltrated. And it's not just a matter of bringing in immigrants. These people that they're
[43:56.720 --> 44:02.560]  bringing in are eventually going to be used against us to tear the infrastructure of the country down
[44:02.560 --> 44:09.600]  from within. They're going to be catered to. I mean, average American citizens now, you might
[44:09.600 --> 44:15.920]  as well call an American citizen an illegal alien because we're treated worse than they are. Oh,
[44:15.920 --> 44:20.240]  absolutely. Over and over again, we point that out. Look at what happened to that journalist who
[44:20.240 --> 44:27.560]  had, he wasn't an undocumented immigrant. He wasn't an undocumented traveler. He had a passport
[44:27.560 --> 44:31.960]  for himself or his family. And then they hassle him a little bit more. Well, do you have permission
[44:31.960 --> 44:38.280]  to travel with your children? And that's the kind of games that they play. But this is a strategy
[44:38.280 --> 44:42.840]  to take down the country. As we pointed out, they strategized about this back in the 1960s.
[44:42.840 --> 44:48.560]  Cloward and Piven, two socialists, wrote that what they needed to do in order to remake the country
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.280]  into their socialist paradise was they needed to destroy the economy to take it down first,
[44:53.280 --> 44:59.120]  and then they could rebuild it. You see that over and over again that is always talked about. They
[44:59.120 --> 45:03.160]  even put that in the Captain America movie that you have to destroy the country before you can
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.600]  rebuild it. Well, the way they wanted to destroy the country was to overload the entitlement system.
[45:07.600 --> 45:11.840]  The welfare system. And that's what we're seeing right now. That's what this is all about.
[45:11.840 --> 45:18.160]  That whole system is going to implode on itself. And the very people that are going to be getting
[45:18.160 --> 45:24.560]  those freebies are going to become slaves to that system, in my opinion. And they're just going to
[45:24.560 --> 45:31.920]  do whatever they're told. And to a free thinking individual, I mean, this is like textbook 1984.
[45:31.920 --> 45:38.200]  Wars aren't meant to be won. They're just meant to be continued. And it's global. It's in every
[45:38.200 --> 45:42.480]  country. And I think if we all just took back, I mean, the information is right there in front of
[45:42.480 --> 45:47.720]  us. It's all over the place. And the average person, I call them bedsheds because they haven't
[45:47.720 --> 45:52.600]  got a clue because they just like their stuff. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you, Joe.
[45:52.600 --> 46:04.240]  Let's go to Carl in Texas. Carl. I couldn't agree more. Definitely a calculated takedown going by
[46:04.240 --> 46:10.520]  stealth. In the past few years, I've taken some some steps to kind of counter it. So using similar
[46:10.520 --> 46:15.560]  tactics in terms of stealth. A lot of the times when I engage people talking about these issues,
[46:15.560 --> 46:22.200]  immigration, and a lot of the other things, the gun confiscation, I use the term thought exercise.
[46:22.200 --> 46:26.960]  Because I'm trying to engage what's left of people's critical sense and kind of make it as
[46:26.960 --> 46:32.600]  to if it's their idea and give them like, you know, the hypothetical and then bring it into
[46:32.600 --> 46:37.840]  reality for them. Or at least try to, you know, give them a little bit of fuel for the fires that
[46:37.840 --> 46:42.240]  I'm trying to start in their minds. So what do you think, Carl, about this situation of Obama
[46:42.240 --> 46:46.960]  going down to Honduras and he's going to essentially identify children that he wants to
[46:46.960 --> 46:52.160]  bring back in the United States and then ship them back in so they don't have to to make
[46:52.160 --> 46:58.440]  the dangerous journey? What about the danger to our children when we bring in people to allow
[46:58.440 --> 47:04.640]  MS-13 gang members to come through the border when we allow this violent drug war that we've
[47:04.640 --> 47:09.600]  created, actually, we created this in Central and South America with our war on drugs. And now
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.760]  we're bringing that violence into our country because we're allowing the borders to be wide
[47:14.760 --> 47:20.120]  open and bring in these, let these gang members come in and even give them special benefits. Of
[47:20.120 --> 47:26.680]  course, these MS-13 minors who are under a certain age, they're going to be able to go to any
[47:26.680 --> 47:31.480]  university that they want to anywhere in the country, get in-state tuition or a full free
[47:31.480 --> 47:37.400]  ride. That'll be a great place for them to start their drug war, start a new turf war with
[47:37.400 --> 47:42.480]  existing drugs. They can go into the universities and they're going to, as students, have access to
[47:42.480 --> 47:49.320]  other students to sell them drugs. Yeah, it's a, you know, who's the president of Honduras? Is
[47:49.320 --> 47:57.200]  the president of Central America? I mean, it just is, it's, like I said, it's too much of an
[47:57.200 --> 48:01.760]  overload to be coincidence. That's, you know, it would be one thing if you could trust these
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.400]  people to be doing things out of the kindness of the heart, but not as a carefully orchestrated
[48:06.400 --> 48:12.080]  plan that's been going on for a long time now. And I mean, you know, we're aware of it, but
[48:12.080 --> 48:16.280]  they've been, they've been sneaking things in, you know, with the, like boiling the frog, the
[48:16.280 --> 48:21.600]  analogy with that, going by itself. I'm trying right now actually to at least counter them
[48:21.600 --> 48:27.080]  culturally. I've been brushing up on my Spanish and I'm trying to engage a lot of these, a lot
[48:27.080 --> 48:31.360]  of people that are here, a lot of people that have been coming here and trying to at least to
[48:31.360 --> 48:37.000]  bring them around to, you know, the classic Americana and the reasons why we have, you know,
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.760]  what's left of our stability. Well, that's great. That's what we need to do. And, but see, when
[48:42.760 --> 48:49.080]  they bring in children so that they get a first crack at them for a number of years before they
[48:49.080 --> 48:53.720]  turn them out, when they bring in children who don't speak English, it makes it all that more
[48:53.720 --> 48:58.200]  difficult for us to have an impact on them. And that's by design. That's why they want to do it
[48:58.200 --> 49:05.080]  that way. That's why they're funding these programs to put robots in homes because they don't want
[49:05.080 --> 49:11.040]  you even at home having any influence on your children. Thank you so much, Carl. Let's go to
[49:11.040 --> 49:17.080]  Lance in Washington, Lance. Yes, it's an honor to speak with you. Thanks for taking my call. Oh,
[49:17.080 --> 49:23.320]  thank you for calling. Go ahead. I want to reiterate how important it is to do it from the
[49:23.320 --> 49:30.480]  grassroots. I carry open up here in Washington state and my neighbors and I have gotten two drug
[49:30.480 --> 49:36.240]  houses shut down to the city and one house that was a old coach's house on a property of the
[49:36.240 --> 49:41.000]  school board. We got it bulldozed and it only took like three months from the get-go starting
[49:41.000 --> 49:48.560]  it up. So you go to city council meetings, get to know your neighbors. That's a good point. I think
[49:48.560 --> 49:55.160]  that is really the key. We cannot count on our elected representatives to stand up for us. They've
[49:55.160 --> 50:01.360]  shown over and over again that they will not do that. We can't elect somebody as president. That's
[50:01.360 --> 50:06.480]  not going to solve the problems. We have to take responsibility just like you're saying, Lance. So
[50:06.480 --> 50:12.240]  we have to do that at home in our community. If we will stand up and do that, that's when it'll
[50:12.240 --> 50:18.160]  get done. If we go to, if we take our notice of jury trial, we go there as an informed juror and
[50:18.160 --> 50:23.120]  we stand up for the rights of our fellow citizen, that's going to be far more effective to nullify
[50:23.120 --> 50:28.640]  bad laws than it is going to be to try to get anyone elected. We see over and over again how
[50:28.640 --> 50:35.120]  spineless they are. We just had a case. This is representative Ryan who went before the Federal
[50:35.120 --> 50:42.080]  Election Commission asked for permission to promote his political book as a fundraiser and
[50:42.080 --> 50:48.280]  essentially has changed what was a fundamental free speech right into a government granted
[50:48.280 --> 50:52.560]  privilege with restrictions. And we're going to talk about that coming up after the break. Thank
[50:52.560 --> 50:56.120]  you so much, Lance and Washington. We're going to be right back with your calls and more news. Stay

[51:39.760 --> 51:45.040]  it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation. Dad knows it keeps his information private. I like

[51:56.040 --> 52:03.320]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here with some important information. I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[52:03.320 --> 52:08.920]  and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply. Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom
[52:08.920 --> 52:13.000]  apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlottesons willing
[52:13.000 --> 52:18.680]  to sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was
[52:18.680 --> 52:24.360]  born. MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding. They now operate two
[52:24.360 --> 52:29.640]  distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women. It is rare
[52:29.640 --> 52:35.320]  to find companies who practice what they preach. And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality

[53:45.240 --> 54:05.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Thurston.
[54:05.240 --> 54:17.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're taking your calls this segment.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.320]  In the next hour, we're going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts, economist, author,
[54:21.960 --> 54:27.720]  and he's got a lot to say about what's going on in Ukraine. Right now, in the last segment,
[54:27.720 --> 54:33.400]  we talked to someone, Lance of Washington. He was talking about how he was taking control,
[54:33.400 --> 54:38.680]  changing things at a local level. That's really where it's going to happen. Of course, we've
[54:38.680 --> 54:43.560]  heard it many times, think globally, act locally. That's the people who are trying to set up a
[54:43.560 --> 54:50.040]  global regime. If we want to think about liberty, we need to act locally, not try to create a new
[54:50.040 --> 54:55.240]  world order by acting locally, but let's try to create a climate of freedom. One of the ways we
[54:55.240 --> 55:00.360]  do that, of course, one of the most powerful things we can do is inform ourselves and others
[55:00.360 --> 55:05.960]  about our rights and duties as jurors. We have to understand that we're there not just to judge
[55:05.960 --> 55:11.880]  the facts of the case, but to judge the law as well. That's one of the most effective ways
[55:11.880 --> 55:17.880]  that we can shut down this tyranny. One of the things that illustrates why we can't depend on
[55:17.880 --> 55:21.880]  our elected representatives, I think, is what happened with the FEC this week. Now, we had
[55:21.880 --> 55:26.920]  Congressman Paul Ryan, one of the leaders of the GOP, who wrote a book. This is part of his
[55:26.920 --> 55:31.000]  re-election campaign. That's what politicians do. They write these little boilerplate books,
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.240]  and they sell them, or they have people buy them, and that's the way they pass money into
[55:35.240 --> 55:39.400]  their campaign. He wanted to buy his own books and hand them out to supporters.
[55:40.120 --> 55:44.280]  Fine. They've been doing this all along. He decided, though, that he was going to ask permission
[55:44.920 --> 55:51.720]  from the FEC to exercise his First Amendment rights. Of course, the FEC is the Federal
[55:51.720 --> 55:59.240]  Elections Commission. Back on July the 3rd, he asked them for an advisory opinion. Well,
[55:59.240 --> 56:05.720]  they got the opinion this week. One of the commissioners is very upset. That's Chairman
[56:05.720 --> 56:11.880]  Lee Goodman, a Republican, said that by failing to affirm his constitutional right, his statutory
[56:11.880 --> 56:17.320]  right, to disseminate a political book free from FEC conditions and regulations, we have
[56:17.320 --> 56:24.200]  effectively asserted regulatory jurisdiction over a book publisher. Exactly. Exactly. They
[56:24.200 --> 56:29.160]  changed the First Amendment right into a government-granted privilege with restrictions. Now,
[56:29.160 --> 56:34.520]  understand the background of this. They wanted the FEC to affirm that the book and its publisher
[56:34.520 --> 56:39.800]  were exempt from the kind of federal regulations, what's called the media exemption. And what that
[56:39.800 --> 56:45.320]  does is that allows us in the media to interview a candidate and to talk about different things
[56:45.320 --> 56:50.200]  in editorials and television channels, other outlets, say whatever we want to about political
[56:50.200 --> 56:58.600]  figures without having to worry about campaign finance regulations. That is very, very important.
[56:58.600 --> 57:04.040]  That is going to have really major repercussions if they are able to shut that down. And so
[57:05.000 --> 57:12.520]  it's really sad to see that the Republicans would turn this fundamental right into a privilege by
[57:12.520 --> 57:18.760]  the FEC go cowering before them because, of course, they're afraid of their power. And of course,
[57:18.760 --> 57:24.520]  because the Congress has abdicated its authority to write the laws of this country
[57:24.520 --> 57:30.600]  to these bureaucracies like the FEC, like the IRS, like the BLM, you name it, the EPA,
[57:30.600 --> 57:37.320]  they write their own laws, not our elected representatives. We now have legislation without
[57:37.320 --> 57:44.680]  representation and even our elected representatives cower before these bureaucracies. And so did this
[57:44.680 --> 57:49.960]  chairman who basically had a problem with this. And yet he voted along with everybody else.
[57:49.960 --> 57:55.080]  The election committee, the FEC approved this regulation by six to nothing. That means that
[57:55.080 --> 58:00.360]  the guy who's criticizing it voted for it. You understand? He voted for it. Listen to this.
[58:01.240 --> 58:06.120]  What they said, they ruled that while he can have his campaign and his pack can buy books and give
[58:06.120 --> 58:12.600]  them out, the promotion on his website has to be limited to just two sentences. Just two sentences.
[58:12.600 --> 58:15.880]  Of course, they didn't put those kind of limitations on Hillary Clinton or on her book.
[58:16.520 --> 58:23.400]  And the two sentences is totally arbitrary. That's a story here on Community's Digital News
[58:23.400 --> 58:30.680]  had those quotes from Paul Ryan and from the Commissioner. This is how democracy dies. We
[58:30.680 --> 58:36.040]  have spineless leaders doing this type of thing. It's why you have to work locally, why you can't
[58:36.040 --> 58:39.800]  count on these people to stand up for your freedoms. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host on this Friday, July 25th,
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.800]  2014. Now, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to be our guest in the rest of the hour beginning
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.680]  with the next segment. Of course, he's an American economist, columnist. He was Assistant
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.600]  Secretary of the Treasury during the Reagan administration. We're going to be talking to
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.640]  him about the situation in the Ukraine primarily. We've been talking about a lot of different
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.240]  subjects in the last hour and wanted to take some of your calls. One of the things we talked about
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:01:00.200]  was how differently the administration treated homeschoolers, a homeschooling family who came
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:06.120]  here as refugees. We hear that they have to go now to Honduras and send refugees from the
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:11.320]  violence violence that I would argue we have created with our war on drugs in Central and
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.200]  South America. Now, the children are being brought into America. The borders are being
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.800]  opened up for those violent multinational gangs to come in. But it's all about compassion for
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.040]  the children, we're told. And yet, there was no such compassion for this family who came here,
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.200]  was granted asylum by an immigration judge and then hounded by Eric Holder and the Department
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.800]  of Justice all the way to the Supreme Court. And as they continued to fight, as it looked like they
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.040]  were going to lose, they basically just put up their hands and let them go. And as I mentioned,
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.680]  we've seen this over and over and over again. When they're doing something under color of law
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.800]  that they know that they're going to lose the case, they basically give that individual a free pass
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.160]  and say, that's all right, you're making a problem, we're going to let you go, but we're
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.920]  going to come after everybody else. And I want to take some of your calls here in the few minutes
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:04.680]  that we've got in this segment before we go to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. Let's go to Loreen in Ohio.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.160]  You said you wanted to talk about homeschooling. Go ahead, Loreen. Hey, I just wanted to give you
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:14.120]  an example of how this works. I had CPS show up in my driveway, somebody had reported me,
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.760]  they said, we hear you're talking bad about the government, that you're talking against vaccines,
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.600]  that you're neglecting your children's education, and you live in a house that's too small for all
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.640]  the people that are in there. And here's the situation. I told them, I'm not a resident of the
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:34.280]  United States or of the state of Ohio. I am not a ward. I am not a minor government official in
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:40.040]  any capacity. I am a natural man, a child of a living God. And what happened is they sent a
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.280]  letter and said, oh, we're sorry, we find no problem, we'll leave you alone. The reason that
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.560]  all these people are getting in trouble is because this is a corporate government. This is not even
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.640]  a democracy, it never was a democracy, it was a republic where all people were equal under the law,
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.120]  but there are two forms of government running. And the administrative jurisdiction that most
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:04.840]  people as U.S. citizens find themselves in are subject to the rules, codes, regulations,
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.720]  and statutes that are written by the corporate government. They have a right to tell their
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.280]  slaves what to do. And that's why in the 14th Amendment, it says all persons born or naturalized
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.520]  in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. That's because there are some people
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.320]  that are not subject to the jurisdiction thereof. Those are the free men. When this country was a
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:29.160]  established, the constitution was written as a body of negative law to control the maids and the
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:35.480]  butlers. They're the ones who have the rules. We, the men, were free kings after the war of
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:41.400]  aggression of the corporations against the several states, which they called the Civil War. It wasn't
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:47.160]  a Civil War. It was the corporations wanting to use the southern land for collateral. And when
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:52.440]  they said no, they brought the force. But the point is they flipped it at that point. At that
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.600]  point, they said, all you U.S. citizens, remember they freed the blacks and I freed them? Exactly,
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.680]  Lauren. And you know what they're doing is over and over again, and they're getting even more
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.720]  obvious about it. Whenever they do something under color of law, if they can intimidate you to do it,
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:10.600]  if they can intimidate you to follow them, they will use that threat of force. Many times they
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.760]  will use force, and they've used it over and over again. Of course, they're using it more frequently.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.000]  They're building for it. They're building a crisis, and they're going to use that as an opportunity.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.120]  They will use force against you, but they will also try to intimidate you. That's why
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.680]  it's so important for you to know your rights, to know that you have a right to film them,
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:33.240]  to know that you have all these other rights. We're going to be taking your calls later in
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.040]  the third hour. Coming up after the break, we're going to be talking to Paul Craig Roberts,
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.400]  of course, the former assistant secretary of the Treasury, about what's going on in Ukraine,
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:51.400]  as well as what's going on in our economy. So, stay with us. We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.040]  I didn't taste dirt in it. God knows what's in there. These people just sampled city of
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.920]  Austin tap water straight from the faucet. Next, we had them try a sample of tap water
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:15.080]  filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system. That one is better. Tastes like nothing. Yep,
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:19.560]  I know what good water tastes like. It's good water. Most tap water contains added substances
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:24.840]  like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others. Studies prove that these substances
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:30.200]  are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:35.080]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water. The ProPure G2.0
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:40.760]  filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean

[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:16.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight live in studio this Friday, July 25th,
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:23.400]  2014. My guest coming up in this segment is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, American economist,
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.880]  columnist. He's former assistant secretary of the treasury during the regular administration.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:34.760]  He's also famous as the co-founder of Reaganomics and we want to talk to him about what's going on
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.480]  in Ukraine. Get his take on it. We have a story up on info wars dot com today. Washington is
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:46.040]  escalating the orchestrated Ukrainian crisis quote unquote to into a war. Before we do that,
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:51.960]  I want to let you know that this hour is brought to you by mypatriotsupply.com. Mypatriotsupply.com

[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:30.200]  That's mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex. Let's go to Dr. Roberts on the line. Dr. Roberts,
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:35.960]  thank you for joining us. That's my pleasure, David. I wanted to talk to you about this crisis. We
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:41.160]  have another article with a headline that was written by Daniel McAdams of the Ron Paul Institute,
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.480]  General Breedlove or Dr. Strangelove. I mean, it is like they are pushing this like we have never
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:54.120]  seen before, trying to push us not only into a revived Cold War, but actually into a nuclear
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:59.000]  war, trying to push for war with Russia. And of course, CNN was happy about the fact that in
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.480]  their recent survey, they found that they've already got 10% of the Americans who want to go to war
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:12.120]  with Russia over an airliner that was shot down. Shot down most likely by the United States
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:18.520]  controlled puppet government in Kiev. Yes. Yes. Yes. And what would they have to gain from this?
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:23.080]  I mean, we just learned within the last 24 hours that the Prime Minister in Ukraine, most of his
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:29.480]  cabinet, has resigned. Their coalition has fallen apart. They were losing militarily in that area.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:35.480]  So what would, what possible motive could they have to stage a false flag attack or to try to
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:41.080]  profit from this and make what may have been, either it was a false flag or it was a tragic
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:47.400]  accident, try to turn that into a stage for a war, another Lusitania or another main or something?
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:57.960]  Well, I don't think the key of government has anything to gain by it. But it's not an independent
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:04.040]  government. It's a creation of Washington. Yes. You have to remember the government resulted from
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:13.240]  the Washington orchestrated coup against the existing government that was overseen by Victoria
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:22.200]  Newland. And the people who took power from the formerly elected government that was overthrown,
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:30.440]  they were Washington's selection. They were chosen by Victoria Newland. So it's a, it's a
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:38.280]  puppet government and you can understand that if Washington is trying to cause strategic
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:45.400]  problems for Russia and if Washington is trying to break off Russian economic and political
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:55.640]  relationships with Europe, which have been growing much to Washington's unease, then having an
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:03.400]  airliner come down with civilians and, and blaming Russia and demonizing Russia, that gives Washington
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:14.200]  pressure to apply to the European countries that are unwilling at this time to follow Washington's
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:22.120]  policy of imposing sanctions on Russia that would break up the European Russian economic
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:29.320]  relationships. So clearly, Washington would have a motive. Now, of course, we don't know that Washington
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:37.880]  is any more responsible than the Russians. It may have been some form of accident or miscalculation.
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:45.320]  We do know that the Ukrainian government, though, was split. You know, you had the American
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:52.760]  Stooges that were groomed to look publicly acceptable. And then you had the extreme right-wing
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:13:01.400]  elements that are, that are have roots back to the Nazis. And those parts of the government
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:07.560]  apparently are in disagreement because the reason the government failed was the right-wing elements
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:16.200]  pulled out. If the reports I've seen are correct, you never know. And so you have the conflict
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:23.240]  within the puppet government, and then you have Washington's management of this conflict. We know
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:32.120]  that Washington does have a black op groups. They may be rogue groups. It may have been organized in
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:39.080]  that way. We just don't know. All we know is the Russians have released their satellite photos.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:45.800]  And the only real evidence we have for those photos, because Washington so far refuses
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.880]  to release its satellite photos. Yeah, there's been an amazing back and forth going on between
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:57.960]  the press, Matt Lee, going after the State Department spokesman and saying, release your
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:03.080]  information. Are you seriously saying that the only thing that you have to go on to pin this on
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:09.000]  the Russians is social media? And we've already seen yesterday it surfaced that there was a month
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.280]  old video. If they're going to just go with social media, there's a month old video from YouTube
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.920]  that had somebody saying a month ago that they were concerned because the plane that they were in
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:24.280]  was being tailed by Ukrainian fighters and that they dropped some bombs and then pulled away and
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:28.840]  said, hey, they could set us up, get us shot down doing something like that. So if we're just going
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:35.000]  to have social media as our only standard, that is something people need to weigh that against.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.920]  But people just don't find that credible that the American government would have no satellite
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.920]  pictures that they're willing to share of this. And of course, the Ukrainian government has
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:50.600]  locked down everything from their air traffic controller. So there's no evidence coming out
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.600]  of the people who are doing the accusations. And yet it is really building in your article here.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:01.160]  You talked about General Philip Breedlove, who keeps repeating the phrase Russian aggression.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:05.080]  Talk about that and the bill that's coming up that they put in the Senate.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:12.200]  Well, what we know is whatever was the cause of the airliner coming down,
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.760]  Washington immediately seized on it to demonize Russia. Yes.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:22.120]  And we've seen this demonization. And as you just pointed out,
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:29.800]  there's never any evidence provided in behalf of the accusations and insinuations against Russia.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:39.240]  Well, what has now happened is even though Obama had to permit US intelligence to
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:47.000]  issue a statement to reporters that there was no evidence directly connecting Russia
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.520]  to the downing of the airliner. This is already now buried under the
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.840]  assertions and reassertions of Russian aggression, Russian aggression.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:05.080]  So we have two things going on that really point toward a major war. One is Breedlove.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:13.400]  He's a four-star general and NATO commander, American. And he has a plan that he is presenting
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:21.320]  at the NATO summit in September that requires enormous buildup of military stockpiles equipment
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:28.680]  on the Russian border such that troops can instantly attack Russia in mass.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:37.880]  So he is mobilizing his plan is to provide the provisions and supplies necessary
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:46.600]  for a massive response to Russia. Of course, excuse is it will be to forestall or deal with
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:53.960]  a Russian incursion from Russian aggression. But we don't have any evidence of any Russian war
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:17:03.800]  plans to attack Europe. We don't see any statements, Russian expansionism. We don't see
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:09.320]  any statements that the Russians see themselves as exceptional and indispensable.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:17.000]  And you know, in light of that, Dr. Roberts, it's even worse than the Cuban missile crisis.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.880]  I mean, we were aggressively trying to expand things at the time. And yet, you know, when
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:28.040]  the Soviet Union starts moving missiles right up to our country right there in Cuba,
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:34.760]  it got pushed back. We're now doing the same thing, even with less reason than the Russians
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.920]  had initially to put missiles in Cuba. We're doing that to the Russians now. And of course,
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:44.520]  when a journalist told Vladimir Putin in a press conference that, of course,
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.440]  we're not amassing these forces on your border, it doesn't have anything to do with you,
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:56.200]  he laughed at her. He knows what this is about. Yeah, I hope so. So we have that. And then we
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:05.720]  have the Senate bill, 2277. I think it's a number. And this bill is cosponsored so far by 22 US senators.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:13.320]  And it says that, well, what it's about, it's got three titles. I describe it in my column.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:22.760]  But it's about equipping NATO, beeping up American military presence on Russian borders,
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:30.920]  supporting the American financed NGOs inside Russia, you know, putting more money so that
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:37.640]  they can be used as fifth columns in the way that they were used in Kiev against the elected
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:45.560]  government. It's about upping the propaganda about Russia, piping more propaganda into the
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:54.040]  Russian Federation, and preparing for war is essentially about preparing for war. So it matches
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:19:06.520]  the breed love suggested. Now, why is this happening? Well, we have information that among
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:13.800]  policy circles in Washington. There is the belief that at this time, the United States has such
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:21.160]  strategic superiority over Russia, that the United States can win a nuclear war. And that this
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:28.200]  and that this strategic superiority is not permanent because Russia is making a comeback
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:37.240]  on the Putin and they're rapidly improving their military. And should we use this
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:42.440]  strategy now? That is that is really key, Dr. Roberts. We want to continue on that. The fact
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:47.160]  that they believe that they've got a window of opportunity here to win a nuclear war. We're
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.960]  talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former assistant treasury, secretary of the treasury
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.880]  and the Reagan administration. We're going to be right back. Looks like they think they can
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:59.560]  win a nuclear war. So they're pushing for it. It really is like Dr. Strangelove.

[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:31.480]  I want you to repeat that again. We're talking about General Breedlove and you were saying that
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:38.200]  you believe that they think they've got a window of opportunity to win a nuclear war here with
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:43.000]  Russia that this isn't just about reviving the Cold War for the military industrial complexes
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.920]  profits but they actually want to push into a confrontation. It certainly looks like that but
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.160]  go ahead. I want you to continue with that. If you could restate that because that's very
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:25:02.600]  important. This isn't new or anything. In fact, one of the articles is available. It's in the
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:09.960]  Foreign Affairs, the publication of the Council on Foreign Relations, which is one of the main
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:17.000]  vehicles where our U.S. foreign policy is discussed and worked out. There's an article there
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:26.120]  that several years old I don't really remember in which it explicitly makes clear that the
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:32.840]  United States has this advantage, that there's a window of opportunity, that the advantage is so
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:41.640]  great that the United States can initiate war Russia win and be rid of the threat of another
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:48.840]  global power coming on the scene that could block American hygieny in the world. You may know
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:57.240]  that the Brzezinski doctrine and the Wolfowitz doctrine both say that it's imperative on American
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:05.240]  foreign policy and military strategy to prevent the rise of any other global power. This is
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:15.160]  the goal and that's what the Ukraine works into. These sorts of things are discussed
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:23.240]  in Washington and the same sort of alleged window of opportunity existed during the Cuban
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:29.240]  Middle Missile Crisis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff pressured President John F. Kennedy
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:36.920]  to allow them to initiate a first strike on Russia on the Soviet Union and the reason given
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:46.040]  was that they don't yet have delivery capabilities for their hydrogen bombs that can penetrate our
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:52.360]  airspace and so we have a chance now to knock them out. Well, Kennedy went berserk, he said,
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:59.480]  you people are crazy and so on. It's one of the reasons people who have spent their life
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:06.360]  studying the Kennedy assassination, I believe that the Joint Chiefs and the CIA were involved.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:10.520]  Certainly, now we have though a president who very much unlike John F. Kennedy wants to take
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:16.680]  advantage of these windows of opportunity. It's not just pressing this doctrine to win a nuclear
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.960]  war with their quote-unquote window of opportunity, but they've got a window of opportunity to
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:24.920]  completely remake the American economy. They've been talking about the Cloward and Piven strategy
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:30.280]  since the 1960s as well and now they have an opportunity to implode the economy with a massive
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:36.440]  expansion of the entitlement state and now they're looking to press what they think is
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:43.480]  their window of opportunity here with the nuclear weapons. Well, David, you can't overlook the fact
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:49.320]  that I'm sure Obama is being told, look, we missed the chance on the Kennedy, we must have missed it
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:57.640]  again. Yeah, exactly. It's like there's not any, everything that we consider to be a crisis and
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:03.400]  they have created multiple crises throughout the world and in our country, they view every one
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:08.280]  of those crises, I think, as an opportunity, don't they, Dr. Roberts? That's why they create them.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:19.320]  Yeah, that's right. Now, what I think has happened in Ukraine, and this is important, Putin saw
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:25.800]  what the American plot was and he understands that the ability of the United States to act
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:34.920]  unilaterally in the world really depends on the support Washington has from Europe and therefore
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:45.080]  when he's faced with this sort of provocative militarism in Ukraine, he backed off of replying
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:51.240]  in any military way as to do not to rescind his authority to use Russian forces in Ukraine.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:59.080]  And his, his bet was that by being unprovoked, by being very reasonable, very diplomatic,
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:06.040]  that he might can break off Europe from the United States or some major country in the,
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:14.520]  in the EU, and that this would be the beginning of the unraveling of NATO and thereby prevent
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:21.640]  this drive toward nuclear war. So that's Putin's bet. That's why there's been no
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:29.320]  no Russian military response to the slaughter of the Russian populations in Eastern and
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:33.880]  so the new crying. We have to go to a break right now, Dr. Roberts. I want to pick up on that because
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:38.600]  we had an article touching on that yesterday talking about the relationship between Germany
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:44.200]  and Putin and where that might happen with the bricks and whether the Germany might be pushed
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:48.040]  into that or if that might be even what's behind the NSA surveillance of Germany. We're going to
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:55.400]  be back with Dr. Patrick Roberts. We're on the march. The empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:03.720]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:09.880]  get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:16.200]  world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:22.280]  a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:26.520]  that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:32.920]  powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals and the results that I personally
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:39.480]  have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals,
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:44.600]  ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com,

[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:11.080]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:16.040]  times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90%
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:21.000]  of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42 million
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.560]  smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:29.960]  numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:35.080]  allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start

[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:28.040]  we have built it with your support now i want to go back to dr roberts we were talking just
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:32.440]  before the break about really kind of the asymmetric warfare that's going on between
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:38.840]  Russia and the United States the United States believes that they can win a nuclear exchange
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:46.040]  with Russia they believe that they have superior force militarily so Putin's strength is not really
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:51.160]  that as you pointed out in the last segment he went to the do-mind said i want you to revoke
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:58.040]  my ability to use force in Ukraine he's trying to show the world that he's not aggressive militarily
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:05.960]  and yet it looks as though they're going to be very aggressive in terms of economic changes
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.520]  that's really where his strength is isn't it dr roberts with the bricks we just had a article
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:16.280]  yesterday where financial analyst jim willey said that he believes that germany is secretly
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:22.600]  planning to join the bricks that'd be brazil russia india china and south africa trying to set up
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:29.400]  an alternative to the unipolar system of the dollar what is that going to do to us as americans
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:38.600]  dr roberts if they're successful in doing that well you know in my book i wrote the failure of
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:45.880]  a laissez-faire capitalism and economic indisolution of the west came out in english last year came out
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:53.560]  in german the year before and in the book i point out to to german because it was published in germany
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:03.160]  with that they stand to gain most by being economically allied russia and of course the
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:10.360]  book's been read in germany and discussed and so this may actually be in their mind or at least
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:18.200]  they are aware that they have an alternative to being tied down in the e u by the european
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:24.680]  central bank by the european parliament and by washington but i don't think it's likely
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:34.920]  that we'll see germany join the bricks this might happen some years from now as more countries
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:43.080]  do what the bricks are doing which essentially amounts to settling their international trade
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:51.400]  relations with one another in their own currencies without the use of the us dollar so it is an
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:59.560]  abandonment by those five countries of using the dollar as well reserve currency now this is likely
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:06.680]  to spread because there's no need any longer in my opinion for a world reserve currency
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:14.120]  this was a role necessary after world war two when every other economy was destroyed no one
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:20.920]  had an economy except the united states and therefore it only it had the only currency that was backed
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:27.160]  by the production of real goods and services you know russia was in ruins germany is in
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:34.120]  ruins england france uh japan was in ruins china was still a third world backwater and so
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:39.560]  it was only the dollar that could provide that role but today you see there are many
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:45.160]  economies that are doing well that whose own currencies are valuable and are backed by
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:52.200]  the output of goods and services and in most cases by a founder monetary and physical policy
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:58.040]  yeah yeah so certainly the case of germany right they can use well germany only has its own currency
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:03.560]  they got tricked into giving up the mark for the euro right that's right it could go back
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:10.040]  and so countries can now resolve their trade in their own currencies and of course is cheaper
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:16.280]  because if you're using the dollar it means first of all you have to pay a foreign exchange
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:22.280]  transaction to convert your currency into dollars and then you use the dollars for payment and in
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:28.280]  the country who receives the dollars then it has to pay a foreign currency transaction to convert
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:34.920]  the dollars into its currency so it greatly lowers cost of settling international accounts
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:42.760]  to deal in your own currencies and to avoid the dollar so this may actually happen it may come
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:50.200]  about and of course if the dollar loses this role it means demand for dollars collapses
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:56.440]  and so would the exchange value of the dollar so the united states would become much poorer
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:02.680]  people would experience a dramatic domestic inflation from the rising price of imports
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:08.840]  in washington would no longer be able to pay its bills by printing money yeah so yeah so the bricks
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:16.040]  in this sense represent a major threat and and that would be another reason washington might
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:23.160]  want to take out russia because russia is one of the two foundations of the bricks along with china
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:29.480]  but and as this article i want to point out as this article said earlier this month the bricks
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:35.080]  announced the creation of a new hundred billion dollar anti-dollar alternative imf bank that's
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:42.600]  going to be based in shanghai and it will be chaired by moscow yes they'll eventually have a
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:53.080]  hundred million you see the imf is used to loot countries for western banks yes and and finally
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:58.120]  the russians and chinese and indians of carot yeah they're going to set up their own looting
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:03.240]  regime right to do that yeah we've been living off of this credit card economy ever since
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:07.960]  we were able to do that after world war two as you point out so many other countries actually
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:13.160]  have a much sounder economy than we do so so what happens you said it's going to be a massive
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:16.680]  inflation we all know that i mean just how bad do you think it's going to be is it going to be
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:24.200]  kind of a hyperinflation once the world goes off of the american dollar i can't predict but i can't
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:31.000]  predict u.s living standards will take a big hit yes but this this could be long and coming
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.560]  it doesn't mean it's going to happen this year or next it could it could be long and coming
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:46.600]  i think that willis you know he sees the direction of things and and of course i see the same
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:53.800]  directions but i think he's a little bit premature and the actual happening but of course it could
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:58.120]  happen quickly one of the things that he mentioned that i thought was interesting was he thought that
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:04.040]  the nsa spying on germany was largely out of a paranoia that they might be trying to make some
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:09.000]  financial move now whether or not that's true certainly what we have done and what's come
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.240]  to light with the nsa spying has prepared the german public to want to essentially distance
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:20.360]  themselves from us and of course we dictate sanctions to them tell them they have to join
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:25.560]  with us on our foreign policy i would imagine that a lot of countries not just germany are getting
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:33.160]  pretty sick and tired of that well they may be actually one of the main parts of one of the
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:42.840]  titles of senate 2277 bill is to ensure our integration of the german military into the
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:50.040]  american military so clearly there is the intent to leave germ put germany in position that its
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:56.920]  military is dependent on american operational procedures and technology and cannot act independently
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:06.040]  you know that's what washington uses nato to do it it incorporates the militaries of the other
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:13.000]  countries into its in a way that they are dependent on the communication system controlled by
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.240]  washington the and all the weapon systems and everything else so in a way it makes these military
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:28.840]  these militaries unable to function outside the american umbrella so i don't know that to come
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:37.320]  back to what we were talking about that tootons bet will pan out for him instead what's happening
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:44.760]  is there's slaughter of these russian speaking people who are living in territories that formerly
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:52.360]  were part of russia itself territories that were attached to the ukraine by various soviet
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:58.440]  communist party leaders and this of course if it continues and these people continue to be
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:04.040]  slaughtered the way the palestinians are being slaughtered in gaza by the israeli military
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:10.600]  it will tend to turn against putin inside russia right now he is very high standing
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:19.800]  but at some point he needs to take action to stop the slaughter of these people who are formally
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:25.880]  russian citizens and if he waits too long it becomes more difficult because we've seen the
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:33.240]  announcement that the united states are now sending military advisers to ukraine now this is
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:41.000]  the beginning then of us direct involvement in the conflict if the advisers if we follow the
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:50.520]  vietnam pattern yes next they'll be fighting and so then this makes it harder for russia to deal
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:58.760]  with the situation in a decisive way without encountering us forces whereas if putin had
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:07.400]  accepted the request for reunification from the ukrainian provinces the way he did from
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:14.680]  Crimea the whole thing would be over with by now because the ukraine has no capability of engaging
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:22.360]  russian military forces and washington would not have had the time to build up all the propaganda
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:29.960]  against russia they would have shown europe a very clear decisive action by russia they would see
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:37.320]  that they don't want part of any american plan that puts them into conflict with such decisive
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:42.600]  decision-making and this would have been the end of the crisis so i think that putin he made a
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:50.600]  reasonable and responsible bet it hasn't worked what do you make of the resignation of the prime
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:55.880]  minister in ukraine yatsenyuk and his cabinet and that coalition falling apart do you think that
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:02.040]  that's going to be a move towards pro-russian forces or is that just sweeping out these guys to
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:07.880]  get somebody in that's going to be more amenable to george soros and company and state department
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:13.400]  yes i don't think soros has anything to do with it it's the united states government
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:20.760]  um look we don't know what happened it could just be a tactic because the parliament
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:29.240]  did not sign off on two of the imf austerity demands and what happened from my understanding
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:36.440]  that we don't have any good reports my understanding is that the right wing parties in the coalition
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:43.560]  pulled out that collapsed the government and then that led to the resignation of the cabinet
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:50.120]  and the prime minister so i think that the initiating factor may have been the withdrawal
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:58.440]  of the two right wing parties the two parties that are usually said to be neo-nazi um that seemed
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:04.840]  to have been the collapse and it seemed to have been disagreement over the austerity
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:11.080]  that the imf intended to impose on ukrainians now how this will come out i don't know the
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:20.440]  the the ministers that resigned are in favor of austerity so whether and they are the ones
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:25.400]  that the united states is backing well now of course also going to have elections at this
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:30.840]  point maybe that's another way for them to establish more firmly their control is to actually
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:35.960]  have elections for the first time we hear the press over here always talking about how the
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:43.640]  self-appointed separatists and Crimea are there but of course these guys are also just as self-appointed
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:50.200]  and if they have the the right and the ability to remove themselves from Russia then of course
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:57.000]  that means that a subsection of their country also has the same human right to secede as
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.320]  self-government and that sort of thing but we see that there's there's very little coverage i think
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:07.400]  actually of of what's going on even the fact that there has been a collapse of the Ukrainian
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.800]  government that's that's not really covered much in the news here even though it's just happened
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:20.440]  yesterday and i heard about it i heard about it from the man who runs global research i quickly
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:25.960]  went to the news it was nothing in the new york times nothing on cnn that's right nothing on
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:31.560]  bbc now i've since heard that last night the bbc had a program on it but it was nothing on their
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:38.840]  website and it already occurred so it may be that everybody was waiting to get washington's spin on
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:45.640]  it but we reported it that's probably what happened it could also be what's happened david is that
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:54.840]  um uh the puppet government that which is inconvenienced by the right wing elements to some
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:49:00.520]  extent may have decided that the ukrainians have had enough of those people and therefore
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:06.680]  you know to collapse the government and have elections might get rid of them on the other
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:13.640]  hand it is these right wing elements that have the armed militias that were the first to attack
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:19.560]  the so-called separatists in eastern and southern ukraine so it looks like they are a fairly well
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:26.520]  organized group and so i don't know whether they can be gotten rid of or not it might it might work
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:31.800]  the other way it's interesting to see how differently they covered it versus the plane crash immediately
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:37.960]  cnn was showing pictures they knew exactly what missile it was and they were they had graphics
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:42.920]  showing it looked like they had a tank with these uh book missiles on it right in the studio because
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:48.360]  it's superimposed that they were the green screen and uh so they were immediately on all of this and
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.320]  immediately had identified that it was vladimir putin essentially that was doing this but they
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:57.720]  were very quiet about the fact that the ukraine government has essentially collapsed in its
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:03.080]  coalition i guess they don't want a narrative that's going to make the ukrainian government look
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:08.840]  weak or illegitimate they want to make it look as legitimate as possible well i think the media is
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:17.160]  just waiting for washington's uh spent and um as you said they're already they were completely ready
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:23.320]  it won't cue to blame russia about the airline and that makes it look orchestrated yes absolutely

[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:28.200]  our number here is 800 259 9231 that's 800 259 9231 we've got some people
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:33.160]  that are still on hold from before dr roberts joined us i want to go to them now but before
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:38.920]  we do i just want to point out this article that's up on info wars dot com today over a third of
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:45.480]  americans want obama impeach that's even one in five democrats favor impeaching president
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:52.680]  uh this is uh 33 percent said they want obama impeached 57 percent of republicans 45 percent
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:57.560]  of people say that obama has sought to expand the power of the presidency too far maybe that's
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:02.040]  why they want to get him out of there and of course what will they do about it we've seen
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:06.120]  a lot of republicans pushing back in the last couple weeks saying oh we don't want to do impeachment
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:10.760]  we've seen op-ed pieces we've seen spokesman for the republican party saying this is a losing
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:16.200]  strategy we want we don't want to do this they need to do it i believe because it's the right thing to
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:22.920]  do if you don't push back you're essentially saying you agree with what he's done you essentially
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:28.440]  say it's okay for president to ignore the law to ignore congress to ignore supreme court decisions
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:36.040]  and do whatever it is that they wish it's wrong to not oppose this kind of activity if you lose
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:39.560]  you lose but you have to have the backbone to stand up that's what we're talking about
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:45.960]  with uh paul ryan when he went before the fec and begged them for an exemption to do what politicians
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:51.640]  have essentially been doing and that is using books that they write to raise money and of course
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:55.800]  hillary clinton didn't go to them and asked for an exemption uh now not that she would really care
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:02.280]  what the law is or what the regulations are but we have certain rights and one of those rights
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:06.760]  is free speech and that's especially about political speech it's not just there about
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:11.720]  artistic freedom certainly that is part of free speech but the first amendment is there
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:17.800]  primarily to protect political speech and if the federal elections commission is going to impinge
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:24.280]  upon that and take part of that and turn it into a privilege granted by them and prescribed by them
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:28.120]  they came back and said well you can't write more than two sentences on your website about it and
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:32.920]  they put some other restrictions on there the fec chairman who was republican was very upset about
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:38.840]  that said that they've established a regulatory precedent here yet he voted for it they slapped
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:46.040]  down paul ryan yet he asked permission from them to exercise his first amendment rights so when the
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:51.880]  republicans say they don't want to go to the bad and they don't want to uh vote to impeach or try to
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:58.280]  impeach obama because they can't win it they just don't have the backbone to stand up for principal
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:02.680]  as all i believe that's behind this the american people are getting tired of this i'm very tired
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:07.400]  of it i'm sure you are if you're listening to this program uh let's go to uh paul in canada paul
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:14.520]  you've got some solutions you said on your on your notes here go ahead paul hey what's your
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:20.920]  solution i'm glad glad to get through finally i'm a long time listener first time call actually not
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:25.240]  first time call i'll try to get through before but i'm glad to get through to you um i just want to
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:28.680]  i got i got a few things i wrote down it's going to shoot through real quick and whatever one you
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:34.360]  want to touch on and remember that's great you can you can give me a reply go for it here's the
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:39.320]  first one alex is always talking about dead kids that i i just want to say that that probably makes
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:45.080]  a lot of people uncomfortable and it turns a few people off on that it's not so much me but there's
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:50.040]  a probably a good percentage of people that as soon as he starts talking uh too blatantly about
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.800]  uh it's just there's not so much gross and black kids on the white house wrong okay we
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:58:00.280]  understand the analogy behind that but when he says uh uh the grinding of a meek weavers and he
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:03.560]  starts going on about rape and all that stuff that that probably makes a lot of people really
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:08.280]  uncomfortable and whether he's trying to get sensational to prove a big message or not it
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:12.440]  automatically turns the people off so you don't you don't think we should speak out against abortion
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:17.960]  absolutely speak out against it but there's there's there's ways to ruin it that's not so
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:23.000]  i mean no i'm not yeah it's very offensive you know when when anti-abortion protesters go places
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.200]  and show pictures of what they do to the children during the process of abortion people get very
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:32.520]  offended by that they should be offended by about it about it anybody with a moral sense
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:36.760]  should be offended by that but not at the messenger hang on i'll let you make your other points right

[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:21.800]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:28.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we've just been talking to collars
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:33.480]  in the last segment we had paul from canada he's offering some solutions paul i want to get back
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:37.000]  to you one of the things that you were saying was you thought that it turned people off a lot
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:43.320]  when alex talks about babies being fed to a meat grinder and yet you know so many times we see
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:49.480]  for instance obama's drone strikes we're told how the military goes in and surgically strikes into
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:55.160]  these areas and it makes it sound like it's such a clean thing and yet as we're seeing in gaza
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:01.160]  there are real human consequences people are blown to pieces children are blown to pieces
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:07.400]  and there are real consequences for abortion we have children who are ripped to pieces and those
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:13.640]  pictures are so graphic that they are censored for the most part they're censored in any media
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:18.680]  they're censored even in most demonstrations they won't allow you to show that because it is offensive
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:24.040]  we should be offended by that and we should try to wake people up with that and that's what alex
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:29.240]  is trying to do he's trying to appeal to people's emotional compass to try to get them to understand
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:34.600]  what's really going on here it is not some antiseptic little surgical thing that's going on here
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:39.240]  anymore than these drone strikes are but i said i'd give you a chance to give us your other solutions
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:44.200]  go ahead thanks david i appreciate it i have to say i do agree with you guys and i don't want to
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:49.000]  take up too much time on this subject but i do agree with you guys i think he's sometimes a little bit too much and i
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  agree that i agree to disagree i'm still 100% in support of you guys uh number two um one of the
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.960]  big things that worked me up when listening to you guys is every time he used to say uh they're
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:07.240]  pharmaceutical we put the fb-40 virus into the vaccine back in 19 whatever if i was wrong about
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:12.680]  that they'd sue me that was a huge huge thing when he said if i'm wrong about that i would get sued
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:17.400]  if you guys just mentioned that line anytime it pops in your head you have new listeners because
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:21.080]  i was i was arguing with my brother last yesterday at working about that same exact thing i said
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:25.160]  if you was wrong about this you'd be sued for defamation automatically let me interject something
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:31.480]  there too and that is it's a known fact especially with cats that it's a very frequent phenomenon
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:37.960]  that they will develop a tumor and cancer at the side of their vaccines now that should tell us
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:43.640]  something because our animals have a much faster metabolism they have a shorter lifespan than we
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:49.800]  do they are essentially the canaries in the coal mine when we see our pets developing cancer
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:53.560]  from vaccines that ought to tell us something but go ahead i'll let you finish your other
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:58.280]  points i just had to interject that go ahead no thanks dave i appreciate i really agree um just
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:02.520]  just to just mention we'd be sued more if they if i was wrong about this fact that i'd get sued
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:07.160]  just boom right there it's automatic default they have to like i mean they don't have to believe it
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:11.240]  they're going to know if it can't be it can't be a lie you can't just come up in the air and make
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:17.320]  up an absolute false lie you'd be sued all day anyways that's great number three there's a new
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:22.040]  weird al yankovic uh video out there i don't know if you guys have seen it but it's the most blatant
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:29.240]  illuminati new world order stuff there is it's it's phenomenal it's called soil okay there's two
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:33.240]  takes i don't know there's two things he lumps in together a bunch of real stuff like the border
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:39.320]  crisis and he lumps in together uh other stuff that's real like NFA spying with with absolutely
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:44.520]  ridiculous stuff aliens cutting your head off and and getting shot he lumps it in with some
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:50.440]  crazy stuff like far past even like with some real stuff and then he says it was a big conspiracy
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:53.800]  and gets dug up now there's two takes on it i'd love to know what you guys think about you can
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:59.720]  tell it top word after the other but um it's it's it's it's sorry i'm sorry well it's kind of a
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:03.880]  you could kind of take it one of two ways you know i mean at first he's doing something looks like
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:08.840]  he's uh making fun of uh alex or you know the the truth or movement or whatever and but then
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:13.560]  at the very end they they do actually haul him off so you know it's like are you paranoid if it
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:17.160]  if they really are watching you are you paranoid if they really are pulling you away so yeah you
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:21.080]  could take that one of two ways and i think he intentionally left it ambiguous because i don't
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:25.320]  think he wants to go down on one side or the other he's just an entertainer but go ahead did
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:30.280]  you have any other point you want to make uh yeah number four mp3 sometimes in your site
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:35.080]  they judge me nuts because i'm a i'm a prison player member and sometimes i like a day i download
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.080]  daily and i need to listen i don't need to listen but i listen to it at work while i'm working so i
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:43.240]  need the mp3 and sometimes it's not there so if you've got you whoever's doing that

[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:40.840]  jones welcome back to the alex joe show i'm david night your host in the studio today now we've
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:45.400]  been taking some colors i want to go over a little bit of news now i came out yesterday on infowars.com
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:51.160]  that joe biden went to the nwcp earlier this week as well as to other places and of course
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:58.440]  joe biden and eric holders justice department this administration says that it is racist if you want
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:06.440]  to fill in the blank no in this case it's ask for voter id now of course the government is all about
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:11.560]  checking our id everywhere they're coming up to people and asking them for id on the street they
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:16.520]  stop people 100 miles inside from the border and want to know if you're an american citizen show me
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:22.520]  your id show me your identity papers please just like in nazi germany everything they want voter
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:28.280]  id they're looking at us all the time trying to get biometric identification they're always
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:34.600]  looking at our faces scanning for faces doing everything if you want to walk into a bar and
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:40.120]  buy a drink unless you're as old as me or john mccain they're going to ask you for identification
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:46.840]  you have to have identification to drive a car everywhere but not for voter id according to
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:53.080]  joe biden and other people he says that any attempt to do this is an attempt to restrict
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:59.480]  voting rights he says we're trying to uh repress minority voting and they're masquerading it as
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:04.440]  an attempt to end corruption he goes on to say that when he made this speech at the nwcp he said
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:09.800]  well there there's been no cases of this reported let me tell you something not everybody reports
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:14.760]  this when it happens i have second hand knowledge of this happening back in north carolina friend
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:20.600]  of my brother-in-law has told him in this last election we went into his actually it was in
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:27.960]  uh 2012 when he went into vote he was told that he had already voted and so had his deceased mother
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:34.680]  because you see in north carolina you only need to give them a name and address you could go into
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:41.720]  the phone book and pick that up and you could vote the phone book because you've got a lot of time
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:46.680]  to do it so let me tell you something anybody that's using this as a beard they've got a different
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:51.880]  agenda they're bringing in a lot of illegal aliens are even going to go into the countries now we
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:57.080]  see that obama is going to start flying children in from honduras so they don't have to make the
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:01.560]  journey themselves we don't want them you know these young children were told that elementary
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:06.680]  school children now are making this uh 1500 mile journey that takes about 35 hours if you do it by
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:11.560]  car but of course they're too young to drive a car so i'm sure they can just walk it themselves
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:16.040]  right no i don't think that's happening i think they are being accompanied by someone i think
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:21.400]  they're using these children as anchors to bring the rest of the family in but he wants those people
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:28.280]  to be brought in he wants them to be able to use voter id so they have non-citizens voting in the
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:32.360]  elections because he knows that they're going to support him of course they can always give them
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:38.840]  citizenship as well and that's the next thing down the pike but even if nobody had done this
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:46.680]  why would we allow the potential for fraud to exist now of course you even have to have voter id
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:52.920]  if you're going to get obama care that's right but the gao the government accountability office
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:57.000]  which is a non-partisan organization they went out and did a sting operation on people who were
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:05.880]  getting their obama care subsidies they did 11 to 18 attempts and in 11 of those 18 attempts
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:11.080]  they found that they were able to get through so i guess obama care even though it asks for your
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:16.600]  id it's not really racist because they're not really checking your id right but it is racist
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:20.840]  they tell us if it's being done in these other states and there's a lot of states who are now
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:27.240]  putting in regulations to require voter id washington post poll last year showed this is
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:35.560]  according to the national review that 65 percent of blacks and 64 percent of latinos supported voter
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:41.640]  id and also the constitutionality of it is not in question either the supreme court upheld the
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:49.080]  fact that indiana had a voter id law it's really just going into states like north carolina or texas
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:54.680]  because those are former states that were part of the confederacy they want to try to push this
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:13:01.000]  racist agenda they don't want people having voter id's or photo id's to vote they don't want to
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:07.480]  establish the legitimacy of the voters anywhere but of course they can do it there by raising the
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:12.440]  racist card so we see this happening over and over again of course the eric holder justice
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:17.640]  department doesn't really care about what the constitution says it doesn't care about the supreme
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:23.480]  courts decisions immediately and either do the democrats immediately after this decision
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:29.720]  with hobby lobby where they got the religious exemption recognized by the supreme court immediately
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:36.520]  after that democrats in the senate as well as in congress put together a bill in the house
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:41.720]  representatives and in the senate to essentially write another law that would take away that exemption
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:48.200]  for close privately held businesses even if they are incorporated but of course they don't get it
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:53.960]  that the supreme court said the constitution says that you can't do that so the constitution
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:59.000]  trumps their legislation so even if they were to go back and do another one of course that it's
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.800]  just grandstanding to their base but even if they were to go back and pass yet another law
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:09.640]  saying that you had to buy or provide certain types of insurance if that conflicted with somebody's
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:15.400]  religious freedoms then it rightfully should be struck down yet again by the supreme court
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:19.720]  let's go back to your calls let's go to mark and california mark what's on your mind
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:26.760]  hi they should take my call at least for your hard work as well thank you i just was really
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:35.720]  wondering why no one's ever mentioned regarding the lost drives for the irs that we can just go
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:40.120]  to the nsa for all that information oh yeah i've heard i've heard some people mention that actually
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:46.200]  there was a story in the news today i'm just going through it as you're talking um tale of the tapes
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:51.800]  this is from fox news they say that the irs head is now confirming that investigators have found
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:59.240]  backup tapes of lois larner's emails um actually they're putting them on tape i wrote this down
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:03.720]  i said they're really still using tape i mean maybe they're even going back and using a paper tape
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:08.200]  you know like the old pdp eights uh from deck i can't believe that they're putting this stuff on
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:15.160]  tape but of course as we pointed out the chances of hers and several other people's disc drives
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:21.160]  failing simultaneously was astronomically small especially when you multiply the probability
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:25.080]  of a chance typically hard disc drives have a meantime between failure about five years so
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:30.280]  when you multiply that out by all these people that supposedly failed at exactly the same time
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:34.360]  there's not a chance that that happened but of course as alex has pointed out as we've pointed
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:40.360]  out they weren't just keeping them on their hard drives they are backing them up you've got companies
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:45.640]  that were bragging about the fact they provided backup for the irs so whether or not they're
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:50.600]  still putting this out on on a tape i don't know i'm surprised that anybody is backing stuff up on
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:54.680]  tape maybe they are maybe they've got enough stuff that they can do it take a long time to
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:16:00.920]  backup very much information on tape however but yeah what what do you think is going on you think
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:06.040]  they've got the irs the emails don't you you know what i think what's going on in an upside down
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:12.600]  world yeah well you know i think what what really offends me though seriously is is the fact that
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:18.680]  the irs which always has the comes to you like every other agency now is is doing that presuming
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:24.440]  that you are guilty and then you have to go to them improve that you're innocent and you have
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:30.120]  to do that by keeping these records and yet they say they don't have to keep the records even though
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:35.160]  they have their company policy that says that they have to keep the records for a number of years
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:39.320]  and that they have to treat electronic records the same way that they do paper records so in
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:45.080]  spite of all of that they're given a pass they don't have to and basically if you go in and you
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:50.760]  we've had a lot of tax protesters who have said that they don't want to we had there was one case
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:58.200]  a number of years ago i remember it was an airline pilot and he did not want to sign his tax return
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:02.760]  because essentially you're incriminating yourself you're opening up yourself to a lot of different
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:11.080]  things when you say everything in my tax statement is correct that opens you up to a lot of persecution
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:15.320]  well he had a very simple tax return he was going to establish that they couldn't make you violate
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:20.680]  the fifth amendment of self-incrimination and he just simply was an airline pilot with no
[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:25.640]  investments no business nothing that would complicate it it was simply a w2 he refused to sign it
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:30.680]  they prosecuted him they sent him to jail because you have juries who will rubber stamp whatever the
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:35.400]  government tells them to do but he was trying to establish his fifth amendment protections and so
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:41.880]  here you have the lowest learner go before congress and claim the fifth and didn't even do it the right
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:47.400]  way they say that they don't have to keep records but you have to keep records they exempt themselves
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:54.040]  from all of the laws that we have and of course if they destroyed records and we treated them the
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:59.800]  same way they treat us then they would be going to jail because it would be a presumption of criminal
[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:04.280]  actions and of course they would not be innocent until proven guilty thank you so much mark in
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:11.720]  california let's go to george in connecticut george hi there i had a um a suggestion but you
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:16.280]  should probably get somebody on there that knows the law really well and maybe we can find out a
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:23.400]  way to have like form some support form process that we do in each state and sue our representatives
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:29.160]  when they break the law whether they're fluoriding us or breaking the law and basically go after them
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:35.400]  for embezzlement because every time they basically supposedly act in our interest and really are
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:40.120]  against our interest and usually the the general public not just our individual interests i'm talking
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:46.040]  about then why should we be able to sue them for the salary they're they're collecting that's like
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:53.400]  embezzlement oh absolutely uh it's not you know what'll happen in in most cases the the courts i
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:57.560]  believe will say you don't have standing we've seen this happen over and over again even with
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:03.720]  lawsuits against the tsa they pretty much have a way to control the legal system i think the
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:08.920]  best way that you can go after them in the legal system is to educate people about the purposes
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:16.040]  of juries i keep repeating this i mentioned this in the last hour we had a divided powers by
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:20.760]  intention in this in this government when they set it up they didn't just divide powers between the
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:26.120]  branches of the centralized federal government they also divided power between the federal
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:31.000]  government between the states and between the people now the people don't just have an election
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.720]  box of course it's not just the ballot boxes we famously heard it's also the cartridge box the
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:42.200]  second amendment but it is also the jury box that's one of the ways that you can stop injustices
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:48.440]  from being done to your fellow man that's the way we roll back and void these laws it's a very easy
[02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:54.520]  way to do it it only takes one person on a jury of 12 to hang the the whole system and to shut down
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:59.000]  these laws we can do that for each other but we have to educate each other we'll be right back with
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:03.960]  your calls we the people grow cotton wheat fabric engrave ink embed strips and fibers to protect
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:08.440]  from counterfeit and carding to a private bank having it led back at interest forcing taxes to
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:12.520]  serve us debt this capitalism or was jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:16.040]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army

[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:40.040]  800 259 9231 that's 800 259 9231 before i go back to the calls i just wanted to
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:46.200]  point out this article that was on new american today atf says guns are the problem and in this
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:52.520]  article what he points out is that there's essentially been a change in strategy in terms of
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:58.920]  shutting down the second amendment from the atf he points out that in george bush's last year 2008
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:05.880]  there were just over 5000 gun violation cases under obama in 2013 there was a decline i'm sorry
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:14.440]  under bush it was 6700 under obama it was just over 5000 it was a decline of 25 so he says it
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:20.360]  looks like even though they're talking about how they want to get guns under control that they really
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:25.800]  aren't doing those kind of prosecutions but it's not that simple he points out that what they're
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:31.400]  doing now is they're actually taking a different strategy they're actually going to an obscure
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:37.400]  part of the 1934 national firearms act that allows the agency to go after violations that they perceive
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:43.720]  to be in the making shipping buying and selling a firearm so that's really where they're focusing
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:48.200]  on that and they point out that these are very arcane difficult rules to follow so they like
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:53.480]  to entrap people with these types of regulations but the key thing out of this article that i
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:58.920]  thought was interesting was the attitude of the atf supervisor that was reported in usa today
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:05.640]  they quoted him by saying do you want the police to solve crimes or do you want them to go out and
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:12.280]  prevent crimes that haven't occurred yet well i think i want them to prevent to solve crimes that
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:17.160]  have happened i don't want them arresting people for things they haven't done i mean that goes way
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:24.120]  beyond the innocent until proven guilty idea okay remember that that antiquated idea that goes back
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:30.680]  to the magna carter you know that's been part of english common law for centuries for millennia
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:34.600]  you know the idea that you have a jury trial that you're innocent until proven guilty how about
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:39.000]  we don't arrest people until there's actually even a crime that they're suspected of committing
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:45.560]  but see that's the attitude of the atf see just having a gun makes you a criminal well
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:51.480]  not exactly true and they point out they say are we supposed to wait for him to commit a murder
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:56.360]  before we target him as a bad guy are we going to sit back and say well this guy doesn't have a bad
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:00.760]  record okay so you know throw him back out there let him kill somebody then when he gets a bad
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:05.800]  record then we're going to put him in jail see that's minority report pre crime but that's the
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:12.120]  attitude of our government they believe that we're all criminals they treat us like criminals because
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:17.080]  they believe we're all criminals and they're willing to shut people down before they have
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:24.280]  committed a crime they manufacture evidence they manufacture charges trying to get people to not
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:29.400]  go through a jury trial even so that they put a whole bunch of bogus charges on people when
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:33.240]  they arrest them try to intimidate them and say oh we'll pull off some of these bogus charges
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:37.880]  if you'll cop a plea to this lesser thing just as we mentioned at the beginning of the program
[02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:42.520]  over and over again we see that when people stand up to the government as individuals
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:47.240]  the government will back off from these things that they try to put on us under color of law
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:51.960]  whether that's somebody having their hog production shut down whether it's the bundies
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:57.320]  whoever it is if you stand up and you say you're not going to do that to us or you stand up to
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:28:02.360]  them as in the case of the Bundy Ranch especially they said we're not going to stand by while you
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:09.320]  wrestle or throw to the ground rather a elderly lady from behind somebody who's recovering from
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:13.880]  cancer we're not going to stand by while you do that type of thing here over and over again we
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:19.880]  report that kind of brutality but I was heartened to see people in that community when they saw it
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:24.840]  happening in their community they stood up and said that's enough we're not going to take that
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:30.120]  all it takes is for you to stand up for you to push back against this they will right now what
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:34.120]  they'll do is give you a pass they'll say okay well then you can do it but we're not going to let
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:40.280]  anybody else raise those kind of pigs but we have to stand up and push them in court let's go to
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:50.520]  your calls right now let's go to John in California John hello John okay sorry I think he's dropped

[02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:08.440]  what we really need to start doing is everybody everybody in their mother needs to start calling
[02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:15.240]  their local radio shows like I for for instance call my local AM radio and I bring up topics
[02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:19.240]  that they're not going to bring up on the radio show um we need everybody needs to start
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:25.080]  confronting their politicians in an ambushed form um we need everybody everybody get the
[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:29.080]  out there and start acting like a journalist that's really what we're going to have to start doing
[02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:33.960]  charity information to get out there absolutely that's the kind of guerrilla marketing isn't it to
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:38.280]  to interject topics that the media doesn't want to talk about because they've got some very specific
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:42.600]  things that they want to talk about and a lot of things that they aren't going to go anywhere near

[02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:37.400]  800 259 9231 tell us what you're concerned about we were just talking to a caller in the last
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:42.040]  segment and he was saying that he thought one of the best ways that we could affect change is to
[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:47.320]  one of the things he does is to call up talk radio and interject topics that they're not talking
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:54.200]  about uh just standard talk radio things that typically not be on uh mainstream radio that's
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:59.080]  what we're trying to do here you know one of the ways that uh i really found info wars was when
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:03.800]  drudge started picking up a lot of tsa stories because that really really outraged me and the
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:09.800]  only people covering it was alex jones and info wars he's been doing this for 19 years and we're
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:14.920]  really starting to have an effect now and it's because of your help you've built this you've
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:19.080]  made it possible for alex to reinvest the money in terms of hiring reporters that we can send to
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:25.000]  locations in terms of building studios to put this out on multiple platforms it's your support
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:29.880]  that makes that happen and one of the things that alex decided a long time ago was that he was
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:34.520]  going to offer products that were going to help you fight the assaults on your health primarily we
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:41.160]  also have other products that can help you to advertise the issues of p-shirts belt buckles

[02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:57.640]  addition to the show um thank you keep talking about keep talking about during um nullification
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:02.520]  we've created a website to educate the american people on their power and authority under the
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:10.840]  bill of rights and the constitution it's uh national liberty alliance dot org national
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:17.080]  liberty alliance dot org okay good and we we found a case where uh it's the uh us versus
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:28.200]  williams where scalia goes on a rant on the power and authority of the people's jury and even in the
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:37.640]  prince versus mac case uh uh for sheriff mac uh scalia says the people are the sovereigns the
[02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:42.360]  sovereigns are the kings the government cannot tell the people what to do and we're trying to take
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:49.800]  back the juries right now by educating people and making a jury list of educated
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.640]  uh constitutionally minded people well that's really important i know that they've got something
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:59.320]  that i believe is going to be on the ballot in north carolina maybe i'm not in north carolina
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:03.640]  now i haven't been there for a while but i believe they've got something on the ballot where people
[02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:08.120]  would essentially surrender their rights to a jury trial and make that okay unless it was
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:12.680]  something like a capital offense or something i do you know about that uh possible ballot access
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:19.080]  issue that possible i know i don't know anything about that i'm a truck driver so i'm hardly ever
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:23.480]  back in north carolina oh okay all right a lot of things goes on i don't know about
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:30.840]  but we're trying to um we're trying to reconstitute the kamala grand jury and we're we're actually
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:36.840]  over half of the states right now have signed on to this in uh in new york state they've got
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:41.640]  almost all of the judges including polenta under indictment right now because they're
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:47.320]  we're demanding access to our courtrooms well that's right this is the people's this is the
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:52.600]  people's court that's our brick and mortar building so that's good everybody should go to this website
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:59.000]  it's national liberty alliance dot org good there's two there's uh two eight hour constitution
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:05.400]  courses there's kamala courses there's the federalist papers the anti-federalist paper papers there's
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:13.640]  there's hundreds of of supreme court case ruling all telling us our power and authority under the
[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:18.600]  constitution you know it really is an education war it's an information war people have to understand
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:23.080]  first you know we get criticized all the time saying oh you're trying to scare people not offer
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:28.760]  them any solutions people have to understand what is actually happening to us number one
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:33.080]  number two they have to understand what their power is that's what you're talking about with
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:37.560]  your website they have to understand what they can do and the powers that they have essentially
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:44.120]  given over that don't need to be given over the fact that you can lawfully for instance record
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:49.160]  the police in public you have the right to do that that's been affirmed over and over again in court
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:53.400]  cases and of course you don't have to physically get in combat with these people if they're going
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:57.720]  to insist on it just sue them in court of course the problem with that is it's not going to be paid
[02:38:57.720 --> 02:39:03.160]  out of the officer's individual account it's going to come out of the taxpayers it's going to do
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:07.640]  that but there's many things that we can do and I think we have to take that approach we have to
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:13.720]  act at the local level thank Liberty act locally I think is what we need to do thank you Jay for
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:22.760]  your efforts in North Carolina let's go to Ronnie in Texas Ronnie thank you sir yes I was calling
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:30.040]  was calling uh basically uh what the kinetic caller was uh talking about the controversial
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:37.240]  subjects which are uh banned basically and uh one in particular that's important to me is in
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:44.440]  80 80 plus of islands you know conserved violence or or at least in favor of medicinal marijuana
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:49.480]  and that's something that is obviously I can't seem to get on the air hardly ever about it
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:58.040]  but and the other thing that um more personally I wanted to mention was that uh I again I don't
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:06.360]  mean to seem paranoid but I've I had a speeding ticket and uh uh the prime I went jump through
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:16.120]  the hoops and went and talked to the prosecutor and uh they told me was dismissed then I got uh
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:22.520]  in the mail I noticed that no well evidently the judge changed her mind and she's not going to
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:27.800]  dismiss it and I was wondering if that what's going on here well I can't give you a legal
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:33.960]  device I I'm not a lawyer I don't know I I know here in Texas that you can actually opt for a jury
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:38.920]  trial uh if you get a traffic violation it's actually a little box that you can check on there
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:43.240]  I don't think they have that in many states they certainly don't make that as an obvious
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:48.360]  choice they so if you if you have uh the ability to do that because in so many cases they set up
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:53.000]  these courts like traffic court so many of them are just kangaroo courts that they set up we see
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:58.200]  that these bureaucracies like the EPA for example or the IRS they they set up their own courts they
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:02.600]  write their own regulations which is essentially writing their law so they have their own legal
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:07.240]  system that they just admit as they want without representation from us or any input from us then
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:11.640]  they have their own court system where you go before judges not before a jury they even have
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:17.880]  their own police force that's doing that it's just like this case where the fellow up in Montana
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.280]  with the eight acres and he built a pond on his property and then the EPA decided they were going
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:28.040]  to extend their jurisdiction previously they had only asserted jurisdiction over waters that were
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:32.760]  crossing borders that were public waters now they were going to go after this guy who had water that
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:38.360]  he'd just collected in this hole that he had dug out it was on his own private property it wasn't
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:43.080]  going onto his property from somewhere else it wasn't going off of his property to somewhere else
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:49.240]  but they came after him with $80,000 a day fines and then just a week or so ago they came out and
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:55.800]  said we're going to now seize that money directly out of your account just as if we were the IRS
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:02.040]  so that's the way they creep with this authority and it's it's it's getting it's getting truly amazing
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:07.960]  so I can't really help you with your traffic thing there but it is it is amazing and we do
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:13.800]  have to stand up for our day in court and one of the ways that you do that is demanding that you
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:18.920]  get a day in court many times you're not going to have a lawyer who is going to put his law license
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:23.720]  on the line by standing up and talking about jury nullification I covered while I was here
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:28.840]  one of the first couple of months that I was here there was a guy called the New Jersey Weedman
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:34.440]  and he represented himself because he couldn't get a a lawyer that was going to invoke
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:39.800]  jury nullification and he actually had the New Jersey Constitution that said that jurors had
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:44.280]  a right to judge the law not just the facts the case the first judge said you can't show that to them
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:49.800]  but he had already done it and he got seven out of the five out of the 12 jurors to acquit him
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:55.800]  the prosecutor came after him a second time the second time he got a judge that allowed him to
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:43:00.520]  leave that sign up and then he was acquitted 12 to nothing at that point they can't come after you
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:05.800]  again typically they can only do like three strikes at you but they can't come after you after you've
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:10.680]  gotten a complete acquittal 12 to nothing and that's what he got but he had to do it himself
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:16.040]  other people aren't going to do it for you the lawyers in most cases do not want to go up against
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:22.040]  a judge and fight the judges when the judges are telling you you have to do what I say let's go to
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:24.840]  thank you Ronnie in Texas let's go to Kathy and Michigan Kathy
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:34.440]  is Kathy gone let's go to oh okay go ahead Kathy hi I love to show a first-time caller yeah I was
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:39.400]  just um wondering how far you think uh this is going to go with the illegals coming in before
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:45.720]  the government decides to um get off their dubs and do something well that's a good question I
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:51.960]  don't know I mean I don't see any sign that anybody is really getting ready to do anything I mean
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:57.160]  the most that anyone has done is Rick Perry who said that he's going to activate the National Guard
[02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:02.520]  but of course from what I saw maybe I'm wrong but the reports that I saw said they weren't actually
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:08.040]  going to deploy them they were they were getting them ready uh they weren't not going to deploy them
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:13.800]  for like another 30 days another 30 days did they take that long to deploy the National Guard
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:18.840]  if there's a hurricane I don't think so so I don't know what they're going to do when they go down
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:23.880]  there they've been uh he's been questioned like do they have arrest authority uh he wouldn't say that
[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:28.440]  they did but now I just saw an article saying that someone has speculated that they may be given
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:33.640]  arrest authority so I don't know but that's the most that we've seen anyone do with that I don't
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:40.600]  think that the Republicans want to do anything it's just like the uh the impeachment of Obama
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:45.560]  they don't want to stand up and take the hit for doing this and they're concerned I think that the
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:51.000]  fix is in that they're going to be perceived as being racist if they try to stop immigration
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:56.120]  that's illegal if they try to stop the takedown of this country and of course I don't know what I
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:00.840]  would like to see happen is I would like to see the incentives removed and of course removing the
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:08.360]  incentives means removing the entitlement welfare state now you can start by removing the incentive
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:14.680]  and the entitlements of people who come here as illegal aliens people who get citizenship given
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:19.400]  to them because they're under a certain age the dream act those types of entitlements can at least
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:26.360]  remove those open borders open immigration as much as I don't want to see the government erecting a
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:34.280]  Berlin wall at the border I know that we cannot have open immigration and an expanded welfare
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:38.760]  state at the same time that is going to destroy the country that was designed to destroy the
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:43.640]  country that was actually a strategy put forward back in the 1960s we mentioned this over and over
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:48.520]  again clowered and pivoted look it up they've been wargaming this for a long time finally they've
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:54.840]  got somebody who's going to do it and I don't know Kathy I mean all I've heard from Republicans is
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:59.320]  like well seal the border and then we'll have immigration reform well immigration reform
[02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:06.040]  doesn't mean amnesty it means do something to enforce the laws that we currently have send
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:10.760]  the people back give them a meal and send them on their way if they're children what do you think
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:16.040]  should be done well basically I agree with you that you know it they should you know to me it
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:22.040]  open up the border it's like Niagara Falls at least you can shut the falls off well it brings
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:27.080]  up the problem of course you know there there is the issue of compassion and I think a lot of
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:34.280]  Christians have a misguided compassion to this we see Nancy Pelosi going to the border two days
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:40.040]  before she supported forcing people to pay for abortions through Obamacare two days before
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:45.560]  that she's standing with Catholic priests Catholic nuns talking about how these children have the
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:51.240]  light of God in them she does that on a Saturday then on Monday she says what about the religious
[02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:55.160]  freedoms of the people who want to have abortions I mean it's like it's some kind of a religious
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:47:01.160]  right to her and then she says this last week she talks about these children are like baby Jesus so
[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:06.920]  they're confusing a lot of people on the compassion side of this but the reality of it is when she
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:11.240]  said that she what wish you could take all of them home with her there's a reason that even she
[02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:17.880]  can't do that it's because we don't have the resources to provide welfare for everyone on the
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:25.480]  planet any more than you could allow people to move into your home and just say feed me you can't
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:29.960]  do that we all have compassion we want to help people one of the things that I believe that we
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:35.080]  could do to help people is to stop the war on drugs that's one of the things that is making it
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:39.720]  so violent in these countries and of course the IMF has gone in there and exploited those places
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:45.880]  for decades going back to Robert McNamara they were accused of rent seeking because the IMF
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:51.160]  stopped financing right in the wake of world war two they were they came into finance infrastructure
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:55.800]  improvements roads and big bridges and that sort of thing then under Robert McNamara they went in
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:48:03.800]  and started extending loans for these countries to to then turn over into the welfare entitlement
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:09.160]  programs and that just made them go farther and farther into debt just as it's doing to us and
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:13.880]  so all the things that we've seen them do to collapse central and south america and other
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:20.040]  countries around the world the bankers are doing that to us now that's what's really behind this
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:25.720]  it isn't practical for us to be able to extend welfare to everyone and yet we see obama
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:30.920]  saying he's going to go down to Honduras and actually fly the kids in with the american government
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:36.200]  so i don't think that uh i don't know who's going to do anything about this i don't see anybody
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:43.320]  standing up to do anything about it that's the sad part about it uh let's go to uh mike in canada mike
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:52.360]  hi david yes hi david just want to say first of uh those two years that you've done uh you fit
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:56.760]  in really well and i have to say when i first started listening to you you sound way more
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:49:01.480]  comfortable and it's really nice to hear your voice well thank you actually when i came here
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:05.720]  i was more experienced behind the camera than it was in front of it says taken a while but i was
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.920]  always politically active and always worked well you know in politics so but uh yes you had a question
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:15.560]  i got a quick question a very quick comment so the quick question is this is i read a uh
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:23.480]  testimony released about c piccionic in italy and within that document uh the prosecutor asked
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:30.600]  apachec about the interviews and tv shows that he does his response in this uh article was that
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:37.400]  when he goes on tv shows and interviews it's fiction and that it's a part of a misinformation
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:41.880]  now this is an italian uh the website is actually called um
[02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:50.520]  which i guess is courier in the evening uh the comment that i'll make and then i'll
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:54.840]  kind of listen to you out the air uh the comment i wanted to make was this is the best radio
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:01.960]  for info wars is when you're being challenged thank you for cheers morgan those are some of
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:08.520]  the best interviews i've seen alex do yes all else i'll say to you it's nice it's it is nice to
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:13.800]  preach the choir but we already know the tune we need to find the people that don't know the tune
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:21.320]  the only way to do that is by bringing in their masters yes that's true well as far as steve
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:27.640]  apachec as to whether or not uh what he's saying is true it's always difficult it's always difficult
[02:50:27.640 --> 02:50:31.960]  especially when you're talking about intelligence matters to determine whether somebody is telling
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:37.320]  you a piece of fiction or whether it's the truth i will say this that he did come out and say very
[02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:43.400]  early on that what was going on in ben gazi was essentially internesson fighting within the cia
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:48.360]  that they were shipping these weapons to uh terrorists that has now that that were going
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:53.880]  to be used in syria and elsewhere and that eventually did come out so i i think you know he
[02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:58.120]  has given us some good intel we need to always vet everyone's sources we're going to be right back

[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:15.320]  yes uh it's uh the power elites um are causing many of the uh crimes today with the clowered
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:24.680]  and pivot nuclear madness uh the balkanization the divide and conquer so i just like with the
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:34.360]  minority report uh pre-crime uh you know we all still have a choice even up to that uh moment
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:41.240]  that the power elite are forcing uh all of earth humanity into these uh you know terrible
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:47.000]  people you know worse than worse choices you look at what's happening in ukraine you look
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:52.520]  at what's happening in israel and gaza and i guess one of the things that bothers me so
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:57.480]  much about it is the pervasive snitch society that they're trying to force on people this
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:01.960]  is a story that we had up on uh drudge report today from uh paul joseph was on info wars
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:07.720]  about the feds urging paramedics and firefighters to help them to turn in extremists so they say
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:11.560]  if if you know i want you to vet these people and if you think that they've got an injury
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:17.080]  that might be due to suspicious activity i want you to uh turn them into homeland security
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:23.720]  that's the kind of east german surveillance snitch state that they're trying to build
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:28.040]  you're talking about turning people against each other i mean it's not just pitting ethnic
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:32.040]  groups against each other it's pitting each and every one of us against the other person
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:38.840]  trying to make us afraid of each other go ahead and that's why the info war is is so
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:48.840]  important to uh use the information that we have because the truth is on our side and uh it's
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:59.000]  going to be just the small group of people uh who are able to uh stand up to these uh power
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:04.840]  elite just like the tank man yes that's true that's true in china and just like the people i i gotta
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:10.520]  say that was one of the most amazing experiences that i've had certainly in the political arena
[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:17.400]  being at the bundy ranch and basically seeing these honest decent people who just had enough of having
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:23.800]  sniper rifles pointed at them for over a week having uh an agent come up and grab from behind
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:29.080]  a lady and throw her to the ground having dogs stuck on them being tasered they said we've had
[02:57:29.080 --> 02:57:32.760]  enough of that and we've had enough of you doing that to our neighbors and they just
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:37.560]  passively showed up and even though they were threatening to shoot them they just said you're
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:41.160]  going to have to shoot us off the horses we're not going to put up with it anymore that was an
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:46.920]  amazing experience i'll i'll never forget that thank you uh craig in wisconsin let's go to uh

[02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:14.280]  spin the situation into something that isn't you know more of a or it's more of a humanitarian
[02:58:14.280 --> 02:58:19.320]  thing meanwhile without borders you don't have a country oh absolutely very obvious hang on i'm

[03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:42.840]  finish your point hi david thank you very much um yeah i just wanted to make the point that i mean
[03:00:42.840 --> 03:00:49.160]  it's my personal opinion and i think the um the border crisis first of all was definitely created
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:54.440]  i mean it was made to be this intense it was incentivized yes the situation all all at once
[03:00:54.440 --> 03:01:00.280]  you know part of claude piven and stuff like that but um my point was that i believe that it is the
[03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:05.800]  implementation of the more north american union that was signed under uh bush i believe oh yes
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:10.520]  just want to they made it quite clear we yeah we played that clip you know polosi one of the
[03:01:10.520 --> 03:01:14.680]  things she said when she went down there for a press conference is we happen to have two people
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:20.200]  just then there's just a border that runs to it it's nothing really and of course patreus is saying
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:25.880]  you know what comes after america well that's simple north america they see this as a an
[03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:31.400]  accomplished fact they see it as a law that was passed 20 years ago and and even patreus said that
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:36.280]  when he mentioned that he said well we passed this 20 years ago now they are making it an
[03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:41.640]  accomplished fact you know we just had this story up on info wars obama calls for a collectivized
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:46.120]  new world order this is from paul joseph watson listen to this quote from obama he said part
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:51.800]  of people's concern is just a sense that around the world the old order isn't holding we're not
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:58.360]  quite yet to where we need to be in terms of a new order that's based on a different set of
[03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:02.920]  principles well actually it's a quite old set of principles you know there's always been this
[03:02:02.920 --> 03:02:08.840]  tension between dictatorships and liberty individual liberty and of course it is now turning
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:13.720]  to a different set of principles here in america a set of principles that is abandoning the rule of
[03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:20.840]  law and abandoning individual liberty let's go to paul in new jersey paul there's no david i'll go
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:28.120]  quickly you you got to realize we've been under communism since 1913 yes oh absolutely you know
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:32.600]  that oh yeah absolutely absolutely we got communism on the bottom and we got fascism on the top
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:39.080]  don't we we got a multi-level strategy there the income tax it's a complete fraud it's unlawful
[03:02:39.080 --> 03:02:47.240]  and you're trapped by the uh a universal commercial code yes i agree all taxing and financial
[03:02:47.240 --> 03:02:53.400]  uh transactions are under universal commercial code and you do not have to pay that tax if you use
[03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:58.680]  it right i agree we all have to we all have to pick our fights i mean i'd still you know i pay my
[03:02:58.680 --> 03:03:03.320]  income tax because we have to to pick where we're going to fight them and how we're going to fight
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:06.600]  them and of course there's been a lot of people that have pushed on that and again going back to
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:11.560]  what we were saying before i think your best chance of getting that overturned is going to be fully
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:16.200]  informed juries i don't think you're going to see any politicians go near that of course we do have
[03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:21.640]  some saying that the income tax needs to be abolished uh you know assuming that it was there
[03:03:21.640 --> 03:03:25.240]  legally in the first place that's something we've not heard before we heard ted cruz say that that
[03:03:25.240 --> 03:03:29.320]  was something used to be only the libertarian candidates would say and we would get harassed
[03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:33.160]  for saying that let's go do uh tom and maryland trying to run through these quickly thank you
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:39.160]  paul for calling tom and maryland go ahead i'll talk quickly mr night thank you for taking my
[03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:44.680]  call and overdrive i appreciate you taking that extra time it's probably why you've got me hooked
[03:03:44.680 --> 03:03:52.760]  on the evening news uh you and your colleagues uh are constantly professional you push the envelope
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:57.720]  and you just don't see that with other newscast well thank you for supporting us couldn't do it
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:04.040]  without you go ahead absolutely you listen you put out a product that you don't find elsewhere
[03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:13.640]  earlier you had a uh who spoke about uh individuals filing wall suits now you correctly noted that
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:19.160]  one of the tricks used by the courts to suppress and oppress individuals was to simply tell them
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:26.840]  that they don't have standing now i strongly disagree with that however um i do have to
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:35.160]  respectfully disagree with you relative to your thoughts on not utilizing the court as a primary
[03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:42.360]  place to try to preserve our freedoms oh no i wouldn't i don't want to give that impression i think
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:48.120]  is very important to fight them everywhere and i think you can have legal victories i was very
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:53.400]  happy to see for instance hobby lobby take it all the way to supreme court and win they had everything
[03:04:53.400 --> 03:04:58.440]  on the line i just understand that everywhere even in the electoral system it's a rigged game but you
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:13.720]  need to play that game you
