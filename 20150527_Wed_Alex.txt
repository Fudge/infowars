[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:21.320]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.320 --> 00:27.280]  secret meeting in london to end cash globally we're gonna be breaking that
[00:27.280 --> 00:33.880]  down we've gotten huge reports on Fukushima saying containers could lead
[00:33.880 --> 00:39.040]  to hydrogen explosion that's our team we've got this whole new soccer
[00:39.040 --> 00:43.640]  indictment globally with the FBI will break all that down but first here's
[00:43.640 --> 00:49.560]  Obama candidate Obama debating president Obama on warrantless wiretapping and
[00:49.560 --> 00:56.640]  big brother spying the separation of powers works our Constitution works we
[00:56.640 --> 01:00.640]  will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims
[01:00.640 --> 01:06.440]  of stubborn rulers and that justice is not arbitrary this administration acts
[01:06.440 --> 01:11.600]  like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security it is not there
[01:11.600 --> 01:17.280]  are no shortcuts to protecting america but my assessment and my team's
[01:17.280 --> 01:26.360]  assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks this administration
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.640]  also puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the
[01:30.640 --> 01:37.920]  security we provide you can't have a hundred percent security and also then
[01:37.920 --> 01:49.520]  have a hundred percent privacy and zero inconvenience we're gonna have to
[01:49.520 --> 01:55.080]  make some choices as a society I will provide our intelligence and law
[01:55.080 --> 01:58.760]  enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the
[01:58.760 --> 02:03.400]  terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom that means
[02:03.400 --> 02:08.200]  no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens no more national security
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.960]  letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime no more tracking
[02:12.960 --> 02:17.320]  citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war no more
[02:17.320 --> 02:23.360]  ignoring the law when it is inconvenient that is not who we are and it's not what
[02:23.360 --> 02:28.240]  is necessary to defeat the terrorists and what I can say is is that in
[02:28.240 --> 02:34.680]  evaluating these programs they make a difference in our capacity to anticipate
[02:34.680 --> 02:41.040]  and prevent possible terrorist activity in the abstract you can complain about
[02:41.040 --> 02:53.680]  Big Brother and how this is a potential you know you know program run amuck but
[02:53.680 --> 02:57.240]  when you actually look at the details then I think we've struck the right
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.600]  balance incredible deception but we got good news Kylie Jenner with her 10
[03:02.600 --> 03:06.920]  million mindless followers is now worried about chemtrails there could be
[03:06.920 --> 03:11.320]  hope here's Leigh Ann's report I'm gonna call this a victory I would like to
[03:11.320 --> 03:17.640]  point out Kylie Jenner yes of the Kardashian family clan tweeted out to
[03:17.640 --> 03:23.480]  her 10 million plus followers a picture about geoengineering and it's
[03:23.480 --> 03:28.680]  questioning you know what are these lines in the sky who's paying for this why
[03:28.680 --> 03:33.200]  is it happening click on that picture and make it bigger so people can see you
[03:33.200 --> 03:37.280]  know why why do I have to see these when I'm on my way to work how is it gonna
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.440]  affect our health and our children's future so I don't normally care about
[03:42.440 --> 03:49.600]  the vapid Kardashian clan and how they have zombies of the world enthralled but
[03:49.600 --> 03:55.760]  Kylie Jenner tweeted this out to her 10 million plus followers so I can guarantee
[03:55.760 --> 04:02.160]  there was a collective neck bending by the zombies of whoa so even if it was
[04:02.160 --> 04:07.360]  only 5% of the people who are following her on Twitter who actually cranked
[04:07.360 --> 04:13.840]  their necks to look up that's still 500,000 people who are now conscious and
[04:13.840 --> 04:19.160]  aware of chemtrails who might ask their neighbor hey what is that just a very
[04:19.160 --> 04:24.040]  very small shift in the collective consciousness of humanity that we need
[04:24.040 --> 04:34.240]  to see sweeping change that is Leanne McAdoo's excerpt from the nightly news
[04:34.240 --> 04:38.560]  last night and it's a big deal to be able to reach the zombies like this and
[04:38.560 --> 04:44.320]  that folks are beginning to research geoengineering so maybe Kylie Jenner is
[04:44.320 --> 04:49.640]  really smart and knows what's going on that is certainly exciting we'll be

[05:26.960 --> 05:33.040]  vehicular manslaughter option then Volvo changed their story and said it was
[05:33.040 --> 05:38.160]  the fault of the owner who failed to activate safety mode as we look at the

[08:43.400 --> 08:49.360]  corrupt Justice Department that is villainous even by third world standards

[08:56.880 --> 09:01.480]  ships guns into Mexico to destabilize that country create mass murder and
[09:01.480 --> 09:06.040]  demonize the Second Amendment the group that's been involved in persecuting

[09:29.200 --> 09:34.680]  there's some corruption in the World Cup no doubt there is corruption in every
[09:34.680 --> 09:42.120]  major sport but you can't have Hitler or Stalin or Jim Jones or Jeffrey Dahmer
[09:42.120 --> 09:51.800]  or John Wayne Gacy or Attila the Hun or Genghis Khan or Caligula or Fidel
[09:51.800 --> 10:01.480]  Castro sit in judgment like Loretta Lynch's Justice Department is doing they
[10:01.480 --> 10:08.720]  have launched a full bore offensive against the FIFA the department
[10:08.720 --> 10:13.280]  unleashed a 47 count indictment Wednesday against 14 international soccer
[10:13.280 --> 10:20.400]  officials you talk about grandstanding and a huge political diversion from all
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.920]  of the corruption of this Justice Department this is like Satan saying
[10:24.920 --> 10:31.600]  he's gonna investigate a bootlegger that's selling whiskey out his back porch I
[10:31.600 --> 10:37.000]  mean it's just too much this is the same Justice Department that won't do
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.880]  anything about rigging the gold and silver market with naked shorts put
[10:41.880 --> 10:46.960]  options this is the same Justice Department that won't go after the NFL
[10:46.960 --> 10:51.360]  with its unparalleled corruption and the incredible corruption of basketball
[10:51.360 --> 10:59.800]  baseball I mean it's joke level how corrupt our Olympic team is all of it
[10:59.800 --> 11:03.200]  people talk about the Russians cheating of course they cheat the United States
[11:03.200 --> 11:09.120]  cheats even worse we're the best at cheating probably and is to sit there
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.080]  with their finger pointed out when they are the worst of the worst of the worst
[11:13.080 --> 11:17.880]  when they are shutting down selectively our power plants allowing Obama to give
[11:17.880 --> 11:21.440]  thousands of waivers to companies to not follow Obamacare and everybody else
[11:21.440 --> 11:27.640]  has to I mean classical picking winners classical big city mafia machine
[11:27.640 --> 11:30.840]  activity I mean you want to live in Chicago you want to live in New York
[11:30.840 --> 11:38.320]  City you want to live in DC baby this is that type of corrupt government system
[11:38.320 --> 11:45.000]  writ large and while we have this going on they're trying to start war with
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.680]  Russia there's more on that we're gonna be getting to but here it is the New
[11:47.680 --> 11:55.520]  York Times if I f a officials arrested on corruption charges and the Swiss are
[11:55.520 --> 11:58.680]  involved investigating as well
[11:58.840 --> 12:05.720]  sep Blatter isn't among them let's be like if they arrested all the heads of
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.600]  the NFL the owners I mean this is this is chilling they get away with anything
[12:10.600 --> 12:17.680]  folks if I f a officials corrupted football u.s. officials say of course they
[12:17.680 --> 12:21.440]  call it football worldwide not soccer
[12:21.600 --> 12:27.320]  Wall Street gets slammed with 5.8 billion in fines for rate rigging sounds
[12:27.320 --> 12:32.080]  like she did a good job Wall Street makes hundreds of billions a day in many
[12:32.080 --> 12:36.320]  cases tens of billions every day off rigging the rates everyone should be
[12:36.320 --> 12:42.200]  going to jail instead of 5.8 billion in fines so my point is we've got stuff that
[12:42.200 --> 12:47.280]  affects everybody rigging interest rates rigging currency trading rigging the
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.360]  stock market with high frequency trading Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase are the
[12:51.360 --> 12:56.080]  leaders and they're the biggest financiers of these administrations
[12:56.080 --> 13:01.040]  understand that they're the ones paying for open borders paying for the TPP
[13:01.040 --> 13:08.080]  paying to go after our guns paying to persecute the church in this country
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.520]  now continuing here ladies and gentlemen
[13:17.280 --> 13:25.760]  that dovetails with this article on info wars dot com this Bloomberg story six
[13:25.760 --> 13:31.760]  banks pay five point eight billion five guilty of market rigging the essence of
[13:31.760 --> 13:39.080]  tyranny is when the elites selectively enforce the law and put people in jail
[13:39.080 --> 13:43.360]  for crooked toenails while they basically sacrifice children on the
[13:43.360 --> 13:50.760]  temple's front lawn secret meeting in London to end cash info wars dot com
[13:50.760 --> 13:59.840]  poll Joseph Watson general Obama isn't going after this are they know because
[13:59.840 --> 14:03.560]  they're run by these very same groups his attorney general won't say a word
[14:03.560 --> 14:08.520]  secret meeting in London to end cash central banks aim to institute quote
[14:08.520 --> 14:13.800]  governmental approval for all purchases and sales to shut down farmers markets
[14:13.800 --> 14:18.240]  to shut down underground economies that you'll need to survive during a global
[14:18.240 --> 14:23.960]  clout and piven artificial implosion a great leap forward a cultural revolution
[14:23.960 --> 14:29.960]  to domesticate you to end normal independent local commerce that's what
[14:29.960 --> 14:34.120]  communists always do that's what fascists always do that's what the
[14:34.120 --> 14:41.840]  talitarians always do the old name for it is serfdom feudalism slavery you think
[14:41.840 --> 14:46.080]  serfs could run businesses on their own before the Renaissance in Europe you
[14:46.080 --> 14:50.320]  think serfs could run businesses in Japan outside of government approval do
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.440]  you think without the show guns okay do you think in any culture from ancient
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.720]  Africa to ancient China from the ancient Middle East to ancient Mesoamerica do
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.440]  you think anybody could have any type of business or operation that wasn't
[15:03.440 --> 15:14.400]  certified and approved no no no no economist Martin Armstrong claims
[15:14.400 --> 15:17.600]  there is a secret meeting to end cash should take place in London before the
[15:17.600 --> 15:20.600]  end of the month involving representatives of the ECB and the
[15:20.600 --> 15:24.280]  Federal Reserve well they've the ECB the Federal Reserve they had a city group
[15:24.280 --> 15:27.680]  the head of Goldman Sachs they had a Bank of America the head of Wells Fargo
[15:27.680 --> 15:33.520]  they've all been in the news JP Morgan Chase saying in cash they already track
[15:33.520 --> 15:38.840]  it with the digital numbers on it and the little monofilament line that's in
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.200]  there the little tape that's got all the history of where the money goes and who
[15:43.200 --> 15:46.400]  has it and where you got it out and who got it and where it got deposited again
[15:46.400 --> 15:51.640]  later Armstrong who was known for successfully predicting the 87 black
[15:51.640 --> 15:57.680]  Monday crash I want to get him on guys as well as the 1998 Russian financial
[15:57.680 --> 16:02.400]  collapse expressed his shock that no news outlet had reported on this upcoming
[16:02.400 --> 16:09.960]  conference it's just like Bilderberg or Bilderberg steering group meetings in
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.600]  fact you can bet that this meeting is preceding the Bilderberg group they
[16:13.600 --> 16:16.560]  always have key meetings right before it then they got the final vote at
[16:16.560 --> 16:21.840]  Bilderberg I find it extremely perplexing that I have been the only
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.760]  one report on the secret meeting in London Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard
[16:25.760 --> 16:29.800]  University and William Booter of chief economist at city group will address
[16:29.800 --> 16:34.760]  these central banks to advocate the elimination of cash to bring to
[16:34.760 --> 16:38.520]  fruition the day when we cannot buy or sell anything without government
[16:38.520 --> 16:44.280]  approval right Armstrong when I googled the issue to see who else had picked it
[16:44.280 --> 16:48.880]  up to my surprise Armstrong economics comes up first others are quoting me
[16:48.880 --> 16:54.520]  but I even find it spreading as far as the central bank of Nigeria but I have
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.960]  yet to find any reports on the meeting taking place in London when my sources
[16:59.960 --> 17:05.760]  are direct once all money exists only in bank accounts monitored or even
[17:05.760 --> 17:08.520]  directly controlled by the government the authorities will be able to encourage
[17:08.520 --> 17:13.160]  us to spend more money when the economy slows or spend less when it's
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.680]  overheating that was a quote by one of the chief bankers will be addressing
[17:17.680 --> 17:24.440]  the meeting Kenneth Rogoff wrote an article we covered this article two
[17:24.440 --> 17:27.720]  weeks ago it was in the news in the Financial Times abolishing physical
[17:27.720 --> 17:32.520]  currency in order to stop tax evasion illegal activity this is by the very
[17:32.520 --> 17:37.560]  banks rigging the markets rigging the interest rates rigging the currency
[17:37.560 --> 17:43.560]  speculation rigging everything these are the big banks caught laundering the drug
[17:43.560 --> 17:47.560]  money caught owning the aircraft and leasing the aircraft to fly the drugs
[17:47.560 --> 17:53.040]  caught running the entire show and they're the ones that want to charge you
[17:53.040 --> 17:58.200]  to have deposits well you're like I'll just keep my money in my basement no
[17:58.200 --> 18:04.120]  you won't because it'll be in their hands so they can start doing the bail
[18:04.120 --> 18:07.800]  ends like they're now selling to do in Greece they've already done in other
[18:07.800 --> 18:13.600]  countries like Cyprus where they just take whatever they want with government
[18:13.600 --> 18:21.680]  approval of course ladies and gentlemen always with government approval so this
[18:21.680 --> 18:26.080]  is how they do it over and over and over again they're making their move on
[18:26.080 --> 18:34.040]  every single front yeah I don't care but but see the lights on camera to but I'm
[18:34.040 --> 18:39.880]  on camera one I mean I don't care it just that it gets confusing I'll try to
[18:39.880 --> 18:42.840]  figure that out though someday because sometimes it's red light sometimes it's
[18:42.840 --> 18:47.080]  green lights sometimes it's no lights on these cameras and whenever I was in
[18:47.080 --> 18:50.840]  other TV studios it's just a red light when it's on and then you just know the
[18:50.840 --> 18:58.680]  camera you're on side issue just side issue we're gonna go to break and come

[24:54.880 --> 25:01.160]  prominent scientists and inventors that built our modern society what's good
[25:01.160 --> 25:09.680]  about it I see innovators saying we are going into a total tyranny close quote

[25:22.160 --> 25:32.480]  ago about the NSA what did Benny say to the Guardian and here in the studio the
[25:32.480 --> 25:40.680]  NSA's goal is total control total oppression this is the goal this is a
[25:40.680 --> 25:45.440]  giant illegal takeover and every other country is basically trying to duplicate
[25:45.440 --> 25:54.840]  what the elite in this country have done the internet of things smart dust where
[25:54.840 --> 26:02.720]  everything has RFID chips in it and is tracked in real time not to stop crime
[26:02.720 --> 26:10.200]  not to empower society but to game economies to consolidate them two years
[26:10.200 --> 26:13.720]  ago I was watching Davos Switzerland meeting basically a public Builderburg
[26:13.720 --> 26:20.560]  meeting where they admit about 90% of it but put their spin on it and they had
[26:20.560 --> 26:24.760]  all these world leaders up there going we are now known as the technocrats and
[26:24.760 --> 26:30.120]  the technotronic era has arrived the quoting's a big to Brzezinski just type
[26:30.120 --> 26:35.480]  in EU bureaucrats call themselves technocrats and say they're building a
[26:35.480 --> 26:42.240]  technocracy a technocracy is a technological tyranny by definition it
[26:42.240 --> 26:48.560]  is ruled by unelected autocrats that control the population through data and
[26:48.560 --> 26:53.560]  gaming of data what does Michael Bloomberg call himself a technocrat look
[26:53.560 --> 26:59.040]  it up type in Michael Bloomberg technocrat and there's all these
[26:59.040 --> 27:03.600]  are interviews with him he's like we have data on everything you do now we
[27:03.600 --> 27:07.760]  know what you want to order before you order it we're gonna have a utopia with
[27:07.760 --> 27:12.360]  the elite understanding with the numbers how to run everything and create a
[27:12.360 --> 27:22.320]  perfect world their perfect world their perfect world their system where they
[27:22.320 --> 27:31.440]  have access to the data and you don't a total tyranny a total technocracy and we
[27:31.440 --> 27:39.160]  just sit here seeing the whole thing roll out they've gone from denying it to
[27:39.160 --> 27:43.280]  just rolling the whole thing out there's the Guardian the technocrats must be
[27:43.280 --> 27:49.120]  voted out at the European elections even mainline liberals like the Guardian
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.120]  are freaking out right now there's another Guardian article out today how
[27:53.120 --> 27:59.680]  millions were spent just the last few weeks to buy off the members of the
[27:59.680 --> 28:04.240]  Senate that voted to not let the public read the TPP the Trans-Pacific
[28:04.240 --> 28:08.280]  Partnership and to give Obama the dictatorial power to make any agreement
[28:08.280 --> 28:15.320]  he wants with anybody on trade period making him a dictator no wonder there's
[28:15.320 --> 28:18.560]  armored vehicles no wonder their surveillance cameras no wonder they're
[28:18.560 --> 28:24.080]  spying on us illegally and going after their political enemies because it's
[28:24.080 --> 28:30.040]  real folks they're going for broke they're going all the way they've
[28:30.040 --> 28:34.080]  committed it's like when you're in college you see that beautiful smart
[28:34.080 --> 28:38.720]  woman even seeing around the dorm or whatever at the gym and you're gonna go
[28:38.720 --> 28:42.440]  ahead and go over and hit on her you're committed and you walk over she turns
[28:42.440 --> 28:45.840]  towards you and you got to open your mouth and you got to see how charming you
[28:45.840 --> 28:50.200]  can be when you invite her out to dinner or to a movie or to go dancing well the
[28:50.200 --> 28:54.040]  globalist aren't asking a nice girl out dancing they've they've jumped off the
[28:54.040 --> 29:00.160]  the high dive they're going in feet first on top of us and they're committed
[29:00.160 --> 29:04.000]  I mean they're putting poison in the water they're Kim trailing they're
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.480]  building new reactors everywhere with even worse technology than 30 years ago
[29:07.480 --> 29:11.600]  where they can just melt down they don't care of reactors melt down they don't
[29:11.600 --> 29:15.520]  care of GMO spreads and gets into the atmosphere and creates a blight which
[29:15.520 --> 29:21.000]  they predict could happen that the movie interstellar is based on their demons
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.360]  folks they're dangerous anybody could study them and and say this is a group
[29:26.360 --> 29:31.240]  of megalomaniacal power-tripping crazy people who are gonna destroy the planet
[29:31.240 --> 29:34.960]  and they're starting war with Russia they're starting war with China they're
[29:34.960 --> 29:42.360]  there they're they're waging war on just life itself because they see anything
[29:42.360 --> 29:47.040]  that's independent from a plant growing on its own to a family as an enemy they
[29:47.040 --> 29:53.160]  are total control freaks we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones
[29:53.160 --> 29:57.200]  and the GCN radio network
[29:58.840 --> 30:03.720]  wherever children can be found having good clean fun you can rest assured
[30:03.720 --> 30:08.320]  there's a control freak not far behind trying to ruin their childhood as was
[30:08.320 --> 30:12.440]  the case in Pennsylvania where a teen was ordered to tear down a treehouse
[30:12.440 --> 30:16.680]  because their neighbor complained at first I thought it was a joke but then
[30:16.680 --> 30:21.200]  I found out it wasn't the teen said according to local reports so then I
[30:21.200 --> 30:26.160]  got really sad and it is sad people complain that teens spend too much time
[30:26.160 --> 30:30.440]  in front of their cell phones and video games but when they go out and actually
[30:30.440 --> 30:34.920]  have physical activity some people find that to be unacceptable this was
[30:34.920 --> 30:39.120]  echoed earlier this year when a family was forced to remove a cardboard fort
[30:39.120 --> 30:43.800]  from their own front yard I had warm positive memories from my childhood
[30:43.800 --> 30:48.000]  about forts and thought it was a great way to spark imaginations away from the
[30:48.000 --> 30:54.600]  TV the father said but no that also was unacceptable you can find more reports
[30:54.600 --> 30:58.520]  on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube
[30:58.520 --> 31:06.960]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop
[31:06.960 --> 31:11.480]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[31:11.480 --> 31:15.920]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music
[31:15.920 --> 31:20.600]  fast food GMOs sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their
[31:20.600 --> 31:25.240]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[31:25.240 --> 31:28.800]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[31:28.800 --> 31:33.040]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[31:33.040 --> 31:36.120]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take
[31:36.120 --> 31:39.640]  we worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are
[31:39.640 --> 31:43.440]  safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula
[31:43.440 --> 31:48.280]  out there introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile
[31:48.280 --> 31:52.760]  and lemon balm and essential nutrients that tastes great obtain your child
[31:52.760 --> 31:57.520]  ease today at info wars life dot com that's child ease exclusively at info

[32:04.960 --> 32:09.040]  news or the news website info wars dot com because the companies I've been
[32:09.040 --> 32:13.560]  approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as
[32:13.560 --> 32:18.600]  they should be so I refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years
[32:18.600 --> 32:23.880]  will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms HD
[32:23.880 --> 32:28.400]  firearms dot com own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs special ops people

[33:18.240 --> 33:24.560]  the price all I want is to be left alone in my average home but why do I always feel
[33:24.560 --> 33:30.440]  like I'm in the twilight zone and I always feel like somebody's watching take
[33:30.440 --> 33:36.280]  heart my friends when I cover all this hardcore information good people always
[33:36.280 --> 33:40.640]  lie down until things get really bleak really dark it's a pattern it's a
[33:40.640 --> 33:45.960]  cycle we're now experiencing what our ancestors have gone through every race
[33:45.960 --> 33:50.200]  color and creed over and over again the cycles of decadence the cycles of
[33:50.200 --> 33:55.320]  rebirth the cycles of renaissance the cycles of decadence the cycles of
[33:55.320 --> 34:02.040]  corruption the cycles of tyranny the cycles of collapse and then rebirth but
[34:02.040 --> 34:07.080]  sometimes civilizations are never really reborn they just stagnate into a long
[34:07.080 --> 34:18.680]  nightmare a dark age a long despotism but things are different now with nuclear
[34:18.680 --> 34:25.880]  weapons and fission fusion and Hadron supercollider cyclotrons geoengineering
[34:25.880 --> 34:30.920]  genetic engineering nanotech the mistakes that elites have made in history
[34:30.920 --> 34:38.120]  before really just their mad power lust to become God will be magnified and
[34:38.120 --> 34:45.800]  manifest thousands of times what they ever were previously destructively
[34:45.800 --> 34:53.800]  militarily millions of times and of elites in every period of human history
[34:53.800 --> 34:59.360]  killed millions and then tens of millions and then hundreds of millions in
[34:59.360 --> 35:05.320]  the 20th century can you imagine when the bloodletting starts this time on a
[35:05.320 --> 35:12.760]  exponential scale it will be in the billions the mathematics of human
[35:12.760 --> 35:21.200]  sociology mass psychology and anthropology to applied multi-level human
[35:21.200 --> 35:28.680]  activity actuaries show total destruction in many areas of this world and the
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.720]  globalists have decided to accelerate this and to control it and to try to
[35:33.720 --> 35:40.880]  write it their argument is it's like the famous reded air bombing with dynamite
[35:40.880 --> 35:45.560]  oil wells that no one could put out using an explosion that's bigger to put
[35:45.560 --> 35:52.920]  out the fire that's what they say at the very highest levels of the last echelon
[35:52.920 --> 36:02.040]  before you enter the star chamber itself of pure satanic evil because you enter
[36:02.040 --> 36:07.160]  that chamber you go to that level it's all about killing everything on this
[36:07.160 --> 36:17.160]  planet as a monument to death the desecration of beauty the desecration of
[36:17.160 --> 36:25.080]  the future the desecration of this long march of humanity struggling fighting
[36:25.080 --> 36:30.280]  betraying honoring the good the bad the ugly everyone who's lived all their
[36:30.280 --> 36:37.400]  hopes and dreams dashed all the good over turning evil defeating evil over and
[36:37.400 --> 36:43.320]  over again going through hell to do it the triumph of good over evil evil can
[36:43.320 --> 36:50.160]  never beat good long term so now evil seeks to destroy all life on the planet
[36:50.160 --> 36:57.680]  to destroy it to have total nihilistic victory and they argue that the elite
[36:57.680 --> 37:02.640]  will then blast off and leave the planet because we weren't meant to save the
[37:02.640 --> 37:11.160]  earth we were meant to leave the earth yes we were meant to leave the earth but
[37:11.160 --> 37:19.320]  we were never meant to destroy the cradle that God gave us and right now we
[37:19.320 --> 37:22.640]  can't get off the planet we're imprisoned here with a bunch of psychopaths
[37:22.640 --> 37:28.520]  who are the type of people that want to grab little kids out of the back of
[37:28.520 --> 37:31.640]  somebody's yard and put them in a basement for two months and torture them
[37:31.640 --> 37:35.480]  and terrify them and rape them and then finally kill them when they go into a
[37:35.480 --> 37:39.240]  catatonic state and have quote been used up well you take those people and you
[37:39.240 --> 37:45.680]  give them 180 IQs and you inbred them and you give them power and that's what
[37:45.680 --> 37:58.320]  we're facing the good news is every top scientist of any repute of any renown
[37:58.320 --> 38:05.320]  is in the news saying we're going into total tyranny anti-human nihilism they're
[38:05.320 --> 38:09.880]  raising an AI system genetic engineering out of control nanotech we're not
[38:09.880 --> 38:14.440]  going to make it back rob you did a piece on a few weeks ago I never aired it
[38:14.440 --> 38:19.800]  we ought to queue it up and play it it's titled Stephen Hawking reads with Alex
[38:19.800 --> 38:23.080]  Jones Hawking came out and said we'll never survive a thousand years and I
[38:23.080 --> 38:28.040]  said Hawking we won't survive a hundred we won't survive 50 he came out a week
[38:28.040 --> 38:32.480]  later and said actually I've revised things we won't survive a hundred we're
[38:32.480 --> 38:36.320]  not going to survive 20 if we don't put the brakes on this right now these
[38:36.320 --> 38:40.120]  people have got to be stopped so yes I'm not worried about them coming after me
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.440]  because I'm not gonna go skeet shooting and fishing and deep-sea fishing and
[38:44.440 --> 38:49.600]  play golf and enjoy a fancy car and go out to fancy restaurants knowing my
[38:49.600 --> 38:53.400]  seed my children will never make it to the future and their children
[38:53.400 --> 38:58.800]  certainly won't all that other stuff is window dressing my life is window
[38:58.800 --> 39:03.240]  dressing compared to the continuum of my ancestors and everything they did and
[39:03.240 --> 39:06.720]  all their genetic information and their memories and their love and their
[39:06.720 --> 39:10.600]  passion and their spirit they pass on like an electrical current connected to
[39:10.600 --> 39:15.520]  myself to my father and my mother and their parents back I am connected to the
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.480]  very first people on this earth just as you are it's epic it's over the top it's
[39:20.480 --> 39:24.680]  incredible look at the airplanes in the sky and all the life and the computers
[39:24.680 --> 39:30.040]  and the relationships and the humor and the music and the mysteries it's so
[39:30.040 --> 39:36.280]  fabulous what God's given us and we're told to sit here and look into the dirt
[39:36.280 --> 39:41.240]  and care what Kim Kardashian is up to and to care what Hillary Clinton's up to
[39:41.240 --> 39:47.240]  and to care what LeBron James and Obama and and and Miley Cyrus and all these
[39:47.240 --> 39:51.960]  people and again I'm all into celebrating human potential celebrating the human
[39:51.960 --> 39:56.240]  structure all of it but that we're given these icons so they can piggyback
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.960]  globalist propaganda on to the celebration of those icons I'm not
[40:00.960 --> 40:04.320]  against celebrating a woman with beautiful dark hair and sexy eyes and
[40:04.320 --> 40:09.040]  voluptuous curves but when she's attached to a bunch of poison I am I'm not
[40:09.040 --> 40:12.520]  against celebrating a piece of cheese it's tasty but I don't want to put my
[40:12.520 --> 40:18.680]  finger on it and it's really a trap and slaps down on my thumb and of course in
[40:18.680 --> 40:24.720]  the scale of things snaps down on my neck snap your fingers snap your neck this
[40:24.720 --> 40:32.160]  isn't a game of people this isn't a joke it's not a drill it's toe-to-toe with
[40:32.160 --> 40:37.600]  scientific psychopaths a scientific dictatorship that's almost ready to walk
[40:37.600 --> 40:42.680]  it's getting up on its knees it's learning to walk we're feeding it we're
[40:42.680 --> 40:49.360]  funding it we're protecting it and it's growing it's replacing the military
[40:49.360 --> 40:55.280]  with robots and drones it's replacing the jobs with robots and drones it's not
[40:55.280 --> 40:58.800]  like it's some innovation that just happened they've decided to end the
[40:58.800 --> 41:04.160]  world as of men you want to defeat the globalist to grow a garden have an
[41:04.160 --> 41:07.440]  outside cook stove get a few acres somewhere in the country even if you're

[41:11.480 --> 41:14.840]  system get with other people and don't comply with the system because they've
[41:14.840 --> 41:18.800]  actually worried the system to implode your economy they've actually waited the
[41:18.800 --> 41:22.760]  system to make you dependent so you can be basically bought off and controlled
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.520]  and then phased out you want your welfare you want your food stamps you're
[41:27.520 --> 41:31.920]  gonna take inoculations and then you're gonna be brain damaged and then you're
[41:31.920 --> 41:37.880]  gonna die I want to get to all this news but look at these headlines prepare your
[41:37.880 --> 41:41.600]  homes and neighborhoods for the violence that is going to sweep America the

[41:45.400 --> 41:51.320]  beginning to disappear and it begins with the lawlessness of government that's a

[42:23.080 --> 42:29.200]  years that evacuated and then your mid-level elite are building bunkers

[42:54.920 --> 43:00.640]  wasn't really sure who they were I knew I'd seen them before in magazines and
[43:00.640 --> 43:04.200]  they explained they said listen you're gonna get really big in the next five
[43:04.200 --> 43:13.200]  years or so and they said it's about five years ago and they said everything
[43:13.200 --> 43:15.960]  you're saying is dead on and then there's more just keep saying what you're
[43:15.960 --> 43:21.800]  saying I'm getting out I'm going to the Cook Islands and others are going to
[43:21.800 --> 43:25.160]  New Zealand and I said what's gonna happen they said everything you say you
[43:25.160 --> 43:30.000]  know and I'm not I can't tell you but there will be no America as you know it
[43:30.000 --> 43:39.640]  it's going to be mad max and was grabbing me by the arms they're gonna

[43:43.480 --> 43:47.000]  got it all prime that people won't turn on the corrupt government to fix it and

[43:51.120 --> 43:54.800]  so the government can sit back and poses the savior I mean you can see them
[43:54.800 --> 43:59.600]  lining it up they've got the communists coming out of dry ice coming out of
[43:59.600 --> 44:04.280]  carbonite coming out of the freezers they're thawing them out all over the
[44:04.280 --> 44:10.640]  place I mean it is not a living dead folks it's bad they're firing up every
[44:10.640 --> 44:15.360]  psychopath every mental patient every wind-up toy screwball nut job there is
[44:15.360 --> 44:20.000]  the left the universities are turning up the heat that's why you see every day

[44:38.600 --> 44:45.320]  bunch of disarmed peasants this hidden Ukraine or Poland and they fought back
[44:45.320 --> 44:48.760]  but let me tell you something do you think you're gonna roll us you got
[44:48.760 --> 44:54.720]  nothing coming but you're meant to be destroyed you're just the ignition
[44:54.720 --> 45:00.920]  you're just the detonation cap fools but there's no doubt the enemy's moving
[45:00.920 --> 45:03.640]  they're getting ready to drop the hammer I don't know if it's this year next year
[45:03.640 --> 45:09.440]  but they're in full crazy Gallup now we backed them off overthrowing Syria right
[45:09.440 --> 45:13.640]  away as the military said no we've had some other successes but this is a very
[45:13.640 --> 45:18.040]  serious time to be alive speaking of serious time to be alive this operation

[45:47.320 --> 45:53.320]  today and the perfect storm I'm going to discuss is a really good perfect storm
[45:53.320 --> 46:01.720]  I have prayed literally to be able to find a high quality gun sponsor that is
[46:01.720 --> 46:06.080]  affordable and that is extremely well-made and effective that I can
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.140]  promote to my audience about six months ago we get contacted by head down

[46:39.640 --> 46:44.400]  reviews go and watch the videos of folks stacking this up against rifles that
[46:44.400 --> 46:50.760]  cost a thousand dollars more their entire line of 556 308 and their
[46:50.760 --> 46:56.360]  accessories are simply amazing and it's designed by battle-hardened vets that
[46:56.360 --> 47:00.960]  know what they wish they would have had right after info wars got two of the
[47:00.960 --> 47:04.720]  head down rifles in we went out to my buddy shane steiner's ranch had a
[47:04.720 --> 47:09.560]  fantastic time now what I have to say so far based off looking at this this is
[47:09.560 --> 47:14.760]  a much lighter weight m4 ar-15 whatever you want to call it this is a great
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.960]  weapon I mean I like how the railing system is for your hands how you can
[47:18.960 --> 47:22.200]  get in it's very comfortable if I want to go in here and do some close quarters
[47:22.200 --> 47:27.240]  and come around this is an amazing amazing gun I wish I had something like
[47:27.240 --> 47:31.040]  this when I was in combat I mean I'm telling you right now an m4 like this
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.360]  would save a lot of lives if the military would just pick this up and put it
[47:35.360 --> 47:41.000]  army-wide marine-wide Navy this is a good gun this is something that stable
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.920]  reliable lightweight and very easy to use well this here is another model of
[47:45.920 --> 47:50.000]  the Provectus line and it's a little more heavy-duty it's really well put
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.960]  together nothing rattles it's got this enlarged charging handle it's ambidextrous
[47:56.960 --> 48:02.040]  I've been playing with the trigger it's about a three and a half four pound it's
[48:02.040 --> 48:07.000]  got a real crisp break to it and again like I've I've have some some custom
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.200]  rifles at home that I've spent large amounts of money trying to get it a
[48:10.200 --> 48:14.600]  trigger that has that tight feel
[48:14.600 --> 48:36.520]  so big here at the office had the idea of getting a mannequin wrapping an ISIS
[48:36.520 --> 48:40.640]  flag around it and sticking a clown wig on top of it with some tannerite and
[48:40.640 --> 49:03.360]  blowing it up and the results were somewhat spectacular in my view guns
[49:03.360 --> 49:08.000]  are an incredible financial investment as well but they're also an investment
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.960]  in the future liberty of this country I'm proud of the fact that the United
[49:12.960 --> 49:16.360]  States is the most armed country in the world and I want to make sure we keep it
[49:16.360 --> 49:21.360]  that way we're not gelded castrated slaves we don't live in North Korea we
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.520]  don't live in communist China we don't live in Fidel Castro's Cuba we live in
[49:25.520 --> 49:30.120]  the United States of America that has been exceptional that has been amazing
[49:30.120 --> 49:34.120]  and then we've been losing ground of the globalist and now the tide is starting
[49:34.120 --> 49:41.680]  to turn the spirit of 1776 is rising and I'm telling you the spirit of 1776 lives
[49:41.680 --> 49:48.360]  at head down firearms HD firearms dot com or you can visit head down products
[49:48.360 --> 49:56.480]  dot com that's head down products dot com that's HD firearms dot com just
[49:56.480 --> 50:01.600]  really really exciting to have a sponsor like this because again
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.880]  conservatively nine hundred to a thousand dollars for their baseline up to
[50:05.880 --> 50:11.640]  sixteen hundred or so similar firearms cost two to three four thousand dollars
[50:11.640 --> 50:18.240]  and I just couldn't believe how good they were versus other firearms that
[50:18.240 --> 50:24.800]  cost basically twice as much and they are private labelers before for some of
[50:24.800 --> 50:28.480]  the biggest names they would make the guns for some of the biggest companies
[50:28.480 --> 50:31.920]  out there they just said for years why don't we just put out our own firearms
[50:31.920 --> 50:35.880]  because quite frankly some books they were supplying didn't want to do
[50:35.880 --> 50:39.200]  quality wise what would take it to the next level so this really is the best
[50:39.200 --> 50:43.320]  of the best you can read third-party reviews all over the place breaking it
[50:43.320 --> 50:46.760]  down saying the same thing I'm saying because I'm not a firearms expert at
[50:46.760 --> 50:51.200]  shooting with decent shot but what I am an expert in is defending the Second
[50:51.200 --> 50:54.760]  Amendment and seeing what the experts say about a firearm check out their whole

[54:44.560 --> 54:50.880]  out there for the price gravity-fed the g2 propure systems I go out and I get
[54:50.880 --> 54:54.960]  that sponsor if I went and researched and went and checked the main gardening
[54:54.960 --> 54:58.840]  sites on who has the best deals on non-gmo heirloom open pollinated for the
[54:58.840 --> 55:02.160]  lowest price and there's a whole bunch of companies it turns out so we get eight

[55:06.600 --> 55:11.240]  companies we'd have all eight of them that's what I want info or store.com to
[55:11.240 --> 55:16.440]  be is a place where I would go to get shortwave radios and emergency radios a
[55:16.440 --> 55:20.560]  place I would go to get pro gun pro America pro Liberty t-shirts to spread
[55:20.560 --> 55:24.360]  the word and meet like-minded people a place I would go to get the highest
[55:24.360 --> 55:29.640]  quality nutraceuticals game changers like x2 nason iodine and secret 12
[55:29.640 --> 55:39.040]  methylcobalamin super female and super male vitality prostiguard it's almost
[55:39.040 --> 55:42.600]  pointless even saying we're about to sell out of child ease how to sell out of
[55:42.600 --> 55:50.360]  our organic oil oregano a lot of these products are just very very simple they
[55:50.360 --> 55:54.280]  work really really good you've heard the right reviews and most importantly it's
[55:54.280 --> 56:00.160]  funding this operation so we can put reporters out there in the field so we
[56:00.160 --> 56:04.440]  can send reporters to boulderburg as I'm doing this year coming up next month so
[56:04.440 --> 56:08.120]  we can put ourselves on cable and satellite which is happening the next
[56:08.120 --> 56:12.240]  few months this is all you funding us and supporting our local am and FM

[56:21.480 --> 56:26.160]  stations not just getting the ratings they have to have the support as well so
[56:26.160 --> 56:31.320]  I'm done ranting on that subject it's just that HD firearms calm all you got
[56:31.320 --> 56:34.640]  to do is call your local gun dealer your local sporting good shop and say hey have
[56:34.640 --> 56:39.520]  you seen the Provectus line have you seen the Triton line have you seen this

[57:03.760 --> 57:07.840]  don't want them other people will this is how you then support the broadcast
[57:07.840 --> 57:11.720]  they could be a major sponsor is helping us create the interest in these
[57:11.720 --> 57:15.520]  companies now they've already gotten to the point where they've been maxed out
[57:15.520 --> 57:18.840]  on production before so it's not like it's some company that's just out there
[57:18.840 --> 57:24.120]  scratching around their patriots their listeners of the show and there they've
[57:24.120 --> 57:28.440]  heard me complain that most big gun companies that actually produce quality
[57:28.440 --> 57:33.800]  our chicken we had to get aggressive with the NRA the last six seven years and
[57:33.800 --> 57:36.840]  basically get in their face till they started defending the Second Amendment
[57:36.840 --> 57:42.680]  and I've had NRA board member Ted Nugent on thanking us for doing that and
[57:42.680 --> 57:47.520]  saying governors of America is the way to go we're all on the same team we love
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.480]  the NRA but they need to be hardcore we're facing radical globalist takeover
[57:52.480 --> 57:58.600]  and if gun manufacturers get aggressive if gun manufacturers sponsor liberty if
[57:58.600 --> 58:03.680]  gun manufacturers pay back into the community then we're gonna support the
[58:03.680 --> 58:07.160]  First Amendment and we'll support the second and they'll support us it's

[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.080]  because it hurts someone's feelings and I like James Woods I think he's a pretty
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.920]  good guy overall the actor I'm also a fan of him I think he's a great actor but
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.400]  he's the one that started the whole campaign and it's funny because I actually
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.800]  bought some t-shirts at Pax Sun this weekend for myself and my son they got
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:33.400]  you know good summer time type t-shirts and I actually saw that shirt and didn't
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.520]  think to buy it just because I thought you know the public's too ignorant they'll
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:44.600]  think I hate America we should be wearing the flag upside down right now
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:50.100]  we should be wearing the flag upside down that means you're in distress so
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:53.560]  when folks with binoculars look at your ship your flags upside down it means you
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.880]  need help America's in trouble it means the country's going down if you respect
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:04.520]  the flag they love to have it at half mass constantly for any reason seems like
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.880]  flags are half mass half the time now no pun intended when I was a kid it was
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.600]  every once in a while they should be flown upside down so you can then have
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.840]  a conversation and say America's in trouble that's why I have directed the
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.040]  crew we can have shirts made right here in the US within two weeks that's why
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.920]  we're putting the design up today I designed it with the crew before the
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:31.160]  show we'll have the final design by the end of the show we're gonna put out a
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:35.480]  t-shirt that's similar to the Pac Sun one that's black with an upside down
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:43.240]  American flag and it's basically gonna say America is in distress save the
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.920]  Republic and then we're gonna have the US code under it and on the back
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:55.400]  explaining when and why you do that United States flag code 8a the flag
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:02.360]  should never be displayed with the Union down except as a signal of dire distress
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.560]  and instances of extreme danger to life of property our country's going down it's
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.640]  being dismantled we're going under UN globalist control the president acts as
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.840]  a dictator now is the time to flag the to fly the flag upside down in fact can
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:20.120]  we flip that graphic in there and fly it upside down right now behind me I mean
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:27.040]  this is the time mayday mayday mayday wake up get out of your trance we can
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.960]  use the incendiary nature of the flag upside down to educate the public on
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.320]  why we're doing it because what the flag symbolizes is being destroyed our
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.360]  veterans are being put on don't treat list our basic freedoms are under attack
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.760]  the Congress is handing over all the authority of the president to sign us
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:50.080]  on to the TPP they're coming after all of our basic freedoms now is the time
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:56.080]  and I've had patriots for 20 years calling in saying I fly my flag upside
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.920]  down and my neighbors didn't like it till I explained it to them and when they
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.680]  come over and say Bob why are you flying upside down I don't like it say hey I
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.600]  forgive you for being ignorant here's the code in the countries in dire
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.760]  straits you're supposed to fly it that's federal law if the country is in dire
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.560]  straits you're to fly the flag upside down and I mean we need to get people's
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.200]  attention we need to get people saying what's that mean now I'd imagine Pac
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.280]  Sun did mean it is trendy I kind of I'm not a big Pac Sun guy but I've bought
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:31.440]  shirts there a few times just because I you know like summertime shirts and they
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.200]  fit me but I guess I did look into it they kind of were leftward leaning and
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.440]  I I do think they kind of meant it as down with America but it does just because
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.000]  they're ignorant doesn't doesn't mean anything the country is in a super
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.440]  crisis right now so I think if you put save America above the flag upside down
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.280]  they'll say what's that mean you'd write born to kill on your helmet then you
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.760]  have a peace sign all something to do with the duality of men no there's not
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.000]  the duality of men it's the proper signal

[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.960]  they go for the cheaper vehicular manslaughter option then Volvo changed
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:36.120]  their story and said it was the fault of the owner who failed to activate safety

[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.920]  thought some of his predictions though interesting probably wouldn't happen he
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:45.120]  predicted deflation not inflation and he predicted basically when it would
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.600]  happen and he's been pretty much spot-on so far so he'll be joining us in the

[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.320]  central banks aimed to institute governmental approval for purchase of
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:35.440]  all sales and that integrates in with the fact that we had two weeks ago six
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:40.640]  banks pay 5.8 billion five guilty of market rigging though the very same big
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:46.560]  mega banks JP Morgan and others that are pushing to end cash as we know it or to
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:52.560]  charge you to even have cash or to charge you then even have deposits
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:58.120]  meanwhile these very corporations paid millions of dollars the London Guardian
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:04.720]  is reporting today to ram through the TPP in the US Senate but that's not
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.760]  corruption that's not bribery it's not bribery to have Hillary Clinton's
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:17.120]  Foundation getting hundreds of millions of dollars in the last decade much of
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:23.320]  it that was supposed to go to charities and things going to her for private jets
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:28.640]  and hotels and mansions but what's even worse is most of its foreign donors from
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:34.920]  third-world dictators and they mixed it all in with campaign funds totally
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.600]  illegal the next to Susan goes to jail for getting the five of his friends to
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.760]  give to a Senate campaign I think it was legal but he pled guilty because he was
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:50.800]  facing 20 years in jail he's still in jail nine months in prison no criminal
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:58.600]  record speechwriter you know work for Ronald Reagan has the second biggest
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:04.160]  documentary film in world history and he's in jail right now but here's the
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.960]  headline out of the State Department's own admissions international business
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.320]  times Clinton Foundation donors got weapons deals from Hillary Clinton's
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.120]  State Department we reported on this yesterday but it's it's in mainstream
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:22.120]  news today that's right dictators and third world countries would give her
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.280]  money when she was at the State Department and then she would go the
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.880]  State Department recommend giving him weapons nothing illegal there move
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:36.640]  along but don't worry the Justice Department that brought you fast and
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.280]  furious and the persecution of Christians and with the IRS and so much
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:48.200]  more in the Tea Party they are now going after 40 of the main leaders of the
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:52.400]  International Association that deals with soccer they've already arrested some
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:59.320]  of them claiming really mild stuff but OBCO it's a big distraction FIFA
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:05.280]  officials arrested on corruption charges so this is the US the criminals
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.680]  that have hijacked it basically acting like global government right now to show
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.160]  the world how clean they are and how they're fighting corruption when they
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:18.480]  are the biggest crux out there in my view now until about 40 after and then
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:25.640]  I'm going to shift gears into Fukushima news and some geoengineering news and
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:31.640]  some other economic news election news Rand Paul news more on the soccer
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:39.360]  situation then we have mr. Dent joining us as I mentioned I wanted to get Lee
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:46.280]  Queen on owner and CEO founder of head down products was founded by David
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:51.200]  unsucker and Lee Queen in a small shop in Powder Springs Georgia their goal was
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.280]  to develop the most reliable and accurate AR-15 in the market this vision
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.120]  was created from a passion for firearms design hunting in the Second Amendment
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:06.720]  HD firearms calm now their site even though it's got a lot of servers has
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.280]  been down since I started plugging it but it should be back up later we'll
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:13.640]  also try to give you a phone number but really what you want to do is ask your
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.240]  local gun dealer local gun shop about head down products that are already have
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.800]  great reviews just say hey go look at the online third-party reviews of these
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:30.080]  firearms the Prevectus the Triton others they got 308 556 you name it
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.680]  and then look at how affordable they are compared to other farms that are two to
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.720]  three times more for something similar you have to go to the very top end to get
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.240]  something like this and this is again half or less of that's why it's such a
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.040]  unicorn I mean it's it's it's like the joke of a super beautiful woman that's
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:51.480]  not high maintenance it's amazing and yes they're a sponsor but we've we've had
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.680]  a lot of firearms sponsors come to us and I said no no no no no then for a
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.320]  couple months well it's like check out this group they're patriots they're
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.680]  great guys they're in Georgia and I'm like yeah really and yeah they supply a
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.960]  lot of big top manufacturers but they're not private labeling now for others
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:10.560]  they're putting out their own and then taking out the middleman cost and I
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:16.520]  went look at the reviews it's been like three four hours overall a month ago over
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:20.920]  a week and just read scores reviews just just just type in head down reviews
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.160]  you'll get the big third-party sites out shooting them thousands of rounds
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.560]  going man the you know the hype is real about these guns they're lightweight I
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:34.480]  shot 2,000 rounds through it no problems beat it up did all this stuff to it it
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.440]  shoots as good as a gun that costs two thousand three thousand dollars and it
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.760]  costs a thousand I mean that's what's so amazing about the head down products
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:47.360]  HD farms dot com but then they're patriot owned they're sponsoring the show to
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.120]  promote the second amendment most gun manufacturers there's some good ones out
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.680]  there that I've approached they're a lot more expensive so I'm glad to have this
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.160]  one such a better deal and they're like oh we don't want to be political we like
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.840]  your show but oh we're not gonna be political that's what Larry Prats talked
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.160]  about is the cowardice well the folks that own this company are also on the
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:07.960]  board of a hardcore second amendment group so it's a win-win-win you get a
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.800]  high-quality firearm at an extremely low price you support the broadcast you
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.200]  support folks that are also involved fighting the second amendment it's what
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:21.200]  I call a 360 win not a win-win-win-win win a win-win-win-win-win I mean we're
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.040]  talking so many wins makes my head spin 360 wins and yes they wanted to do it
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.400]  they've got one that's got info wars dot com on it mo on lobby with an Alex
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.800]  Jones signature on it it's it's classy it's small and nice and I'm sure it'll
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.280]  have collector value to it especially some ever happens to me but it's not
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.200]  much more to you know end up getting it with that in the ad I cut I didn't even
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.000]  promote that because quite frankly that's not the reason to get it because you can
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.360]  get a version that's got you know mo on lobby looks really cool on it our design
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.800]  with a helmet and then Alex Jones under his side though I am very honored to be
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:05.440]  on what I see is the top of the line I mean it's the top 3% of assault rifles
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.640]  out there and I mean in fact I can't wait to walk around on our family ranch
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.400]  and shoot wild hogs with this because you know even if you got a lighter AR 15
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:19.560]  it gets exhausting or are the 308 really heavy I've got a Reaper their 308 is a
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:25.080]  lot lighter and I tend to get one so I'm not knocking reapers it's great I got
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.680]  one I spent $3,000 on they got something somewhere for $1,500 so I mean
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.800]  there you go and it's lighter so I'm I'm ranting Lee thank you so much for
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.120]  coming on with us today I'm really excited and I want folks to call their
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:43.360]  local dealers and tell them get the HD firearms line in today thank you so much
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.680]  for your support of the Second Amendment and the First Amendment thank you
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:51.640]  Alex for having me on the show today it's very proud to have you as our spoke
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:56.320]  persons fantastic well tell us about your company because you've been around for a
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.640]  while but not selling direct to the public I know special ops loves your
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.520]  stuff Joe Biggs started salivating after he was shooting it he's a combat vet
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.240]  everybody that I know that's a gun nut that knows more about guns than I do just
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:13.640]  say these are really amazing guns you know head down started was kind of mine
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.880]  and David's you know vision to it really was a hobby be honest with you I got
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.520]  really frustrated with buying firearms and basically having to re-outfit them
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:26.520]  to do what they should have done to begin with so we started out with the
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.920]  idea of hey let's just do something for us maybe some are friends of fellow
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:35.280]  shooters and really started just building it from the ground up started
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:39.000]  with with with billet parts versus forage parts which is the majority of
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.160]  they are 15 market is forged up and low receivers and the tolerances tend to be
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.480]  a little bit loose on that so we decided to go billet that way we can control it
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:55.680]  started producing more and more rifles for people and it turned into really more
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:01.160]  of a nice instinct and we had we were approached by several companies and we
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:06.720]  private label for years making tens of thousands of guns for these people and
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.640]  we finally got the point we're like you know what we're we're tired of cutting
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:13.360]  corners that they're private labeling it's their name but you know what let's
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.640]  just do it ourselves let's just really push it out there and let's make it the
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.680]  best it can possibly be and that's that's really what we've done well you
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.720]  have I mean I mean when I saw the great reviews I said okay let me shoot it and
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.400]  then I'll probably work with these guys and then I started reading more reviews
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:32.080]  and I went out and shot it I got the rifles in my hands I mean they're so
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:38.720]  lightweight then they shoot so good how did you do that we took a lot of time on
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.640]  the the accessories that we put like foreign rails and things like that to
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.720]  really examine and pay attention to what operators needed I mean some of our best
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.040]  advisors were people that were active combat or still active military and
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:56.640]  everybody tell you as you said earlier in the show when you have to carry a
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:03.520]  firearm around the heavier it is the more miserable it can become so we basically
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.840]  wanted to make it to where it was really really light but extremely durable so we
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.920]  based it really off of the design of the upper low receiver integrated trigger
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:17.840]  guards to give rigidity to the gun the foreign rails we made into where they
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.160]  were very functional that could utilize basically anything you could ever want to
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.480]  put on the gun but be light enough where it didn't just make you miserable all day
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.120]  long I mean I'm a big guy I shoot a lot but to be honest with you man I don't
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:35.720]  like carrying a heavy gun either so we kind of basically made head downs guns
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:40.560]  are based off what Dave and I look at you know what I think you know every guy
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:43.840]  out there or every female out there would be comfortable carrying this gun and
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.840]  now we have the backing of people that do this for a living to say your gun is
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.080]  steadfast and that's what's really important to us we put a lot a lot of
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:58.880]  emphasis on feedback we want you to break our gun break it send it back to
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.920]  cost you nothing we'll fix it for free and send it back to you show us a weak
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:06.720]  point we love that kind of thing we'd never backed away from it we'll take
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:11.840]  Barrett it was basically designed in a garage in Tennessee and I love the
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.280]  American success story from a garage to now your big factory that we went and
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:20.120]  visited will show some footage of that and your crew you don't discriminate
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.200]  against folks that aren't veterans but I like the fact that most your folks are
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:28.440]  veterans armorer special ops people and then I was Joe was talking to people he
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.400]  knows and special ops and others and they go oh yeah we're already using a
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.320]  lot of those guns we love them this is the type of rifle that should be
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.880]  available system-wide and Joe was talking about being in combat in Afghanistan
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.280]  Iraq he was in a staff sergeant so he could have extra money to get something
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:46.840]  better but even the stuff he had that was better wasn't as good as what you've
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:53.080]  got and costing more but he said what is issued is giant clunky basically crap
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:57.960]  and he just said he can't believe that those guns because he's seen the purchase
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.920]  orders you can look at them online the military's buying them generally for more
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:08.600]  than what your firearms cost yeah the the government the firearms industry is
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:13.260]  really unique it seems to be more of a I won't say political agenda but it's
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:16.520]  seen it's it's who you know with them when it comes down to that and that's
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.480]  under that's understandable I see how that works we've had a lot of special
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:26.680]  operations group contact us over the past few years there's one particular
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:32.680]  unit that carries our weapon we're not a liberty to say who it is but we built
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:38.480]  up to their specific specifications and they've been extremely happy with it
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:45.920]  again you have to keep in mind that that community is so small everybody knows
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.880]  everybody so when you give a product to some of these special individuals that
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:56.320]  work for our government if it's not a hundred percent steadfast you'll never
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.760]  ever sell another one to anybody in that group so we pride on ourselves on
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:04.760]  making sure that if it's gonna go in the hands of somebody it's going to be
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:10.120]  dependable I mean all of my guys here that armors or combat veterans they've
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:15.840]  been in battle they have had to rely on this weapon system to save their life
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.200]  and it's very important to me that every gun that leaves head down has their
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:26.320]  stamp of approval well it's amazing we just threw some scopes on them and then
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:30.200]  just took them out and we're shooting really accurate after about 10 minutes
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.640]  then we left the shooting range and we were shooting at 100 200 yards bull's
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:37.160]  eye and we don't plan to be great marksmen you know just just pro second
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.000]  amendment folks all I know is compared everything else I've shot it's the best
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.920]  and I'm almost embarrassed that I've got rivals that cost me two thousand three
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:49.200]  thousand dollars that aren't as good but in all fairness I bought those three
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:53.640]  four years ago I know that there's been an evolution but from what I've read in
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:57.720]  the different third-party review sites the big ones you guys are right there on
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:02.440]  the cutting edge right there in the top few percentage points yeah I would put
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:07.800]  our weapon our rifle against any rifle manufacturer that builds a similar style
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:13.960]  AR I mean I we have been in many competitions and law enforcement trials
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:20.560]  to do tests and evaluations and we've always the ones we've had to participate
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.840]  in are got the purgates participate in we've always come on top and the thing
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.960]  of it is a lot of these smaller departments that really do need this type
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.760]  of weapon with the some of the threats that we have facing us nowadays can't
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:36.600]  afford some of these other companies that charge you know two and three thousand
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:41.080]  dollars and one of our local community police departments I mean they were
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:45.040]  thankful that they could buy a gun that they could rely on that would work that
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.760]  didn't literally break the bank and they couldn't facilitate anything else for
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.640]  off officer safety that's right you could arm two police officers with say
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:57.640]  you're frightened instead of arming one with leading competitor who were not
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.080]  attacking but let's face it a lot of these guys would just buy the guns from
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:05.440]  you and then double the price correct you know Alexa there's a lot of good
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.720]  companies out there Alex I would never ever say anything bad about another
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:14.080]  company I'm running them down I mean I mean if your gun was $2,000 I think it
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.160]  would be worth it and I'd be promoting it but the thing is it's such a game
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.400]  changer that it works so good it's so high quality and it's so much less I mean
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.240]  there's nothing wrong I guess would be in greedy but I guess you guys just aren't
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:31.320]  being greedy no we don't head down's not based off of greed we wanted to have
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:36.600]  people the working man be able to own a quality rifle I mean our starting
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:42.800]  Triton series starts at $849 you can't buy anything out there comparable to
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.520]  that that's a billet gun versus a forged gun said he had a trigger done like
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:53.000]  yours on a $2,000 rifle and it costing $500 yeah you can buy our trigger for
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.160]  $179 and it's comparable to everything out there's three and $400 we don't
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:04.400]  want we don't want I want people to embrace the Second Amendment I want
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:09.840]  them to be able to utilize and get something that's going to be quality
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:15.040]  that they can use and be proud to have when you price some of these companies
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:20.920]  prices so high people can't afford to get things like that and unfortunately they
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.720]  don't get to exercise our constitutional rights as they should be able to
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.600]  you sound like Henry Ford he ended up making 20 times as much more money than
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.520]  his competitors because he did the right thing and priced the cars where the
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:37.680]  where his employees could buy them yeah I am I'm not I'm not real big on home
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.520]  runs I'd rather just get hitting singles and doubles make people happy keep them
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.200]  satisfied be there for them when they need me I mean head down is very
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.080]  approachable I mean if you have a problem you don't call your dealer you call
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.840]  head down you talk to one of our managers or you talk to one of our
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:59.080]  armors and say this is the problem half what I do we should be back to us we
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.880]  generally turn around in a week we want to be there for our consumer we don't
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.520]  want it to be one of these things well oh yeah yeah well John Smith has problems
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:09.840]  gone well we'll send it back to you there been a lot of folks involved the
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.440]  Second Amendment industry that aren't there for the Second Amendment you guys
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:18.800]  are in it you love it your vets your patriots it's the American dream that's
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:24.080]  why I'm so excited about this I mean I use the allegory of the unicorn I mean
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.640]  it's really hard to find one of those I'm telling you head down is that and so
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.720]  we're so excited about you guys being sponsors and not being cowards because
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:34.560]  I mean so much as you know with the gun industry and I'm not knocking them it's
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:39.880]  just true we had to basically bully the NRA with Gunners of America and others to
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.480]  stop me I'm so wimpy five years ago I know you guys are also involved in
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:48.240]  Second Amendment groups as well aren't you yes ACU which is arms is united
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.560]  I'm on their board as the manufacturer visor yeah unfortunately Alex I think
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:58.160]  that our industry has become kind of like an Austrian just a sticker head in
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:03.840]  the sand and it'll go away well we won't do anything about it and this the worst
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:09.400]  things these people have such a platform they could get out there and educate
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.440]  people of what to do with I just thought I'm just now extra as my second
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.520]  amendment rights I'm proud to be a gun owner proud to be an American now what
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:22.360]  I do well no one's out there really saying okay well listen you need you
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:26.440]  need to lock this gun up or put the ammo in a different place they don't do any
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.880]  of that so then it's a big huge thing when somebody leaves it out and somebody
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:35.320]  steals it runs off with it education is the key to our second amendment rights
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:40.960]  in especially in day and age I question none of the original amendments ever
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.600]  that is our foundation of our country that is what our country is based on
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.840]  this was the greatest country in the world nowadays people want a warning
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.640]  label on everything so in our day and age in my opinion and it's just my
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.800]  opinion we all know who those are I think education is the key I think that's
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:02.160]  very important we've got to promote a gun culture or we're gonna lose everything
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.720]  we're starting to gain ground finally because we started promoting the
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.120]  Americana culture of independence and that starts with the right to free
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.160]  speech and the right to defend yourself and if we don't get on the offense we
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.800]  will lose so you got to learn how to use guns learn the proper safety learn how
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:22.640]  to stow them get involved in a shooting group and then bring someone else in who
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.880]  isn't part of the culture and that's how we're gonna win look at what the
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:30.320]  socialists do with their colleges they take normal kids screw them up we've
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:36.320]  got to take people and deprogram them oh I agree 100% there's such a fear I had
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.560]  this question asked me today that you know this is dangerous and that is
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:45.520]  dangerous and I was like people are dangerous and what gets me is about
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:48.800]  people that are in and I'm glad we have liberals I'm glad we have conservatives
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.280]  I you know yin and yang it takes the world to go around but what a lot of
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.560]  people don't realize is your second amendment enables you to have your first
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:03.280]  and without those two together you're out you can forget about it what we have
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:10.000]  will be over and notice it is all being destroyed I mean when they attack one
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.280]  part they attack the other and that's why the first and second come first and
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:20.480]  second because they team up together HD firearms dot com Lee is the site back

[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:25.000]  the show I mean maybe twice a year you'll hear me have a sponsor on the
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.400]  broadcast and and generally it's concerning news in that industry like
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:33.160]  when FEMA got caught trying to corner the market on storeable foods last year
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:38.680]  or I did have a sponsor on of ammo manufacturer who they were trying to
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:42.200]  borrow their ammo up from so I mean I occasionally do that if there's a bill
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.560]  to ban body armor we'll have a sponsor up about that but it's not really about
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:52.280]  the product itself this is about the product we're not like NPR we're not
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:57.600]  like MSNBC who on record got their parent companies like $2 million in
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.120]  stimulus money over a hundred million went to MSNBC including a raise for
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:08.440]  Rachel Maddow your tax money went to that anti-freedom witch we don't do that
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:14.280]  we have some great sponsors but mainly we sell our own products t-shirts books
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:19.080]  videos cookstuffs it was just stuff I like I mean I kind of want info or
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:23.040]  store.com to be like a Cabela's and just be high-quality stuff stuff I'm into
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.040]  stuff I personally use I mean I don't promote something you can hear ads on
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.000]  the network that are their own sponsors I'm you know check them out for
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.880]  yourself I'm not saying they're good or bad you hear me endorsing something I've
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:39.520]  really checked it out I believe in it I use it and you can tell I'm very very
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:49.680]  very very excited about head down firearms going back to Lee Lee what is
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.560]  the best number for folks if the website goes down because of hundreds of
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:58.960]  thousands of folks visiting it or if folks don't want to get online can they
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:03.240]  call you guys and talk to you and purchase a firearm that have it shipped
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:07.800]  to their local dealer to take possession of it what's the best process for that
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:16.200]  the best number to call is 770-485-7015 that that's our direct line to head down
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:19.680]  that number up because I had it here and wanted to make sure that was the
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:28.280]  correct one 770-485-7015 770-485-7015 thank you go ahead yeah so they can call
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.760]  directly here and basically tell us what they want order whatever kind of
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.520]  firearm they want so I just fly us with their dealer and we can ship it to them
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.800]  it has to be again within state and federal laws you know some of our
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.920]  unfortunate states in this country doesn't allow these types of firearms but
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.600]  as long as it's a legal process it's not a problem we can ship it anywhere in
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.160]  the United States it's usually just boom you buy it it shipped right to the
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.000]  dealer unless you're talking about DC New York or somebody like you know some
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.320]  place like Chicago right yeah the some of those unique states unfortunately
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.440]  people have had their rights taken away from them unfortunately and I it's
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:13.080]  really sad I hate that for them Lee I've been ranting here I want to give you a
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.280]  10 minutes or so before you leave us and I get into news to talk about any other
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.040]  subjects as an American as a patriot talk about the different line of firearms
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:26.080]  you have what you're planning to come out with it's head down products some of
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.360]  the other amazing products you know that's the other reviews I've seen that
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:35.600]  are just as positive or more so is your accessories yeah we we started doing
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:43.200]  holsters context so it's actually have one and again it's a we make them for
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:48.160]  just about every type of pistol you can buy they're made out of kydex they have
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.480]  the same as that warranty is our rifles it's a hundred percent you break it
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.720]  send it back we'll replace it or fix it for free there's no charge on it and
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.080]  again a lot of kydex products again are out there that are eighty ninety a
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:08.800]  hundred dollars ours are sixty five we do glock slides as well this is one of
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:13.000]  our blocks that we have and I think I actually sent one to someone in Texas
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.480]  that you know this is something we do you can get a complete block with this
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:24.240]  type of machine work done on it for seven hundred ninety nine dollars so the
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.680]  closest thing comparable to it's between fifteen and three thousand dollars
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:33.400]  again I wanted to put a product out there that people were happy with they
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.520]  could afford that there's so many things out there that people would like I mean
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:40.720]  I can remember so many times in my life Alex that I wanted to buy something but
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:46.400]  it was just so unattainable because the price was so ridiculous and I don't
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.200]  want people to compromise I want to build something they're gonna like and
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:52.200]  embrace and it's a generational thing it's gonna be passed down to their son
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:57.800]  or their daughter and you're promoting the Second Amendment and you're on a
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.320]  major gun group board I mean it is really a win-win and I thank God for the
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:05.800]  blessing of you guys being a sponsor it's so exciting and I just can't wait to
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:10.520]  take my son and daughters out in fact I think I'm going to get them all the
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:14.080]  Triton series I mean I've got to be honest I shot the more expensive ones the
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.760]  ones that the special ops guys like and they're great and Joe Biggs big combat
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:22.280]  vet again was salivating over that one the Provictus which means I guess you
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:27.400]  know win before the war through through vigilance but I like the baseline when
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:34.000]  the best man that that is a sexy rifle our Triton series does the best for us
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.200]  Alex the gun weighs you're talking about the weight of the gun I believe the
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:46.360]  Triton 15 weighs 6.7 pounds oh man on your back you can't even feel it yeah
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:53.640]  it's basically the same exact thing as what a standard base M4 would be and you
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.760]  get the rail went you can attach the accessories so forth and so on amazing
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:01.360]  tell us about some of the other rifles well I happen to have one you were
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:06.160]  talking about the 308 this is the 308 that we're doing now that is sexy yeah
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:11.240]  as a matter of fact it was put under review at one of the big media training
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:15.880]  facilities in Daytona, Florida that's real good friends mind they took my
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:20.680]  personal rifle took it down there and he liked it so much he wanted me to let
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:24.520]  him bar it for a very long extended period of time but they were using that
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.400]  weapon in engaging targets out the 942 yards of the confirmation I got last
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.520]  night now that that particular gun starts out all of them Alex have
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:37.920]  stainless steel match-grade barrels on them from the from the entry level all
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:43.960]  the way up the entry level 308 from head down all billet is 1650 so again
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:51.640]  something that's attainable for people that rifle you just showed that's over
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:56.840]  $3,000 with most major competitors that in my research aren't even as good yeah
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:00.680]  again it was one of these things where we looked at it so I can build something
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:05.640]  that is going to perform as well or better than everybody else's and do it
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.360]  for less for again consumers I mean I'm not trying to be this great guys out
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:14.520]  here don't I'm not a non-profit but I'd rather get it to the masses and I'd
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.880]  rather get them a product that they're comfortable in there they can be
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.160]  complimentary of and they're going to embrace instead of yeah it's just
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:24.840]  another one of these things I want them to own a head down because they're proud
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.800]  to be head down well I gotta be honest I've bought some expensive guns and you
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.920]  kind of feel screwed and pathetic when you go and get it because it was so
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:37.200]  expensive I mean maybe and I must my that's of you know has buyers remorse
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:43.840]  it's just it does kind of feel weird that it costs so much and and and but to
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.080]  get something you know is basically half the cost and it's just good or better
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:52.960]  it's just sickeningly good yeah it is a little bit of a unsettling Alex when you
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.960]  have somebody that has a $3,000 rifle and you shoot as well as I do with the
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:01.680]  thousand dollar gun it kind of it kind of takes a little little air out of
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:04.760]  their sails if you know what I mean and it's again it's nothing against them
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:08.000]  spending extra money I'm glad they do but it's you know keeping moving this
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.240]  economy but it I'm very very proud to say what Dave and I've created a head
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:19.200]  down it's you know we we started a training division to help educate people
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:24.680]  and to help be able to let them exercise their constitutional rights in a smart
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:30.320]  safe fashion and I think that's really what's important and you know again I
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.800]  really you've touched on this Alex so many times and I'm so glad there's
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:39.160]  somebody out there that actually has the the strength and the willpower to say
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:42.840]  hey you know why are y'all cowering down from this you need to stand up for your
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:47.720]  rights before you lose them all together well that's it we have to get
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:52.600]  aggressive the other side is so embarrassingly tyrannical and pathetic
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:58.240]  but we just cower to them so they take over all that evil needs to try up as
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:04.440]  good men do nothing as Thomas Jefferson said yeah it's it is scary you know I
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:11.240]  have I have two children my youngest is is an it's in a public school and to
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:16.880]  hear some of the things that that our schools are teaching about you know they
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.760]  really do have a very liberal agenda in a lot of aspects and it's very kind of
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:24.880]  it's disturbing to me you know you got to stand up for yourself you got to stand
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.960]  up for your rights our forefathers were very very smart I don't know how that
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:34.720]  group of people got together so many years ago but the things that they put
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:38.840]  in place for us are still majorly impacting everything we do in life and
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:44.160]  have preserved our way of life for over 200 years and why people want to try to
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:48.880]  kick that and break that down and reinterpret they made it very simple
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.480]  when they spelled all these things out on purpose where they couldn't be
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.560]  interpreted it was undoubtedly Providence if you study history even
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.040]  foreign historians from Russia and France and England marveled at our
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:06.360]  founders I mean Benjamin Franklin invented like 2000 things I mean
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:10.120]  literally like a third of the stuff I was reading one day what he invented like
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:15.040]  a third of the things in our house he invented with greatest country in the
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:21.320]  world the best you know I don't want to see that lost by someone that is you
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.920]  know pushing their agenda on the majority of people and that's that's
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:30.120]  really why I have no problem speaking out for the Second Amendment and that's
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.480]  when when they see you ask me to be on their board I welcomed it with open
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:39.360]  arms I want my children and my grandchildren my great-grandchildren to
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.960]  have the same rights that you and I have I want them to have more rights than you
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:48.760]  and I have I feel like we've lost a lot of things unfortunate in the last 50 to
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.520]  75 years I want them to get that back I want them to live in a country they can
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.120]  be proud of and be free and that's that's something that I think to people
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.480]  people take their freedom for granted oh they do they don't they don't realize
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.440]  how good we really have it and that's really sad to me I watch these young
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:10.680]  communists trust fund kids the rich parents not knows criticizing free
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.320]  market economics and trashing this country and then you ask him have you
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:18.000]  been to a communist country have you been overseas do you realize you might get
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.680]  one meal a day and they just spit in your face they just have no idea what
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.720]  this country's given them it makes me sick yeah I watched that video of you in
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:30.600]  the midst of that I wish I could have been there with you we've probably had a
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:37.000]  good time of that I you know when I saw that I was absolutely speechless to
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.640]  know that anybody's parents would allow their children to run so wildly free
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:47.520]  without any part of respect for anybody else's thought process if people want
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:51.040]  to get out there and exercise their first amendments and talk about they
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:55.000]  don't like this they don't like that and I'm all for that please do but you need
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.240]  to be respectful of other people stop let's say what they were doing they were
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:02.440]  saying we love to kill our kids we love Satan we love now we're gonna get you
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:07.200]  and then attacking us and grabbing our microphone and breaking it and we now
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:11.320]  have the footage we haven't put it out yet of them punching a guy I know named
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.400]  Ronnie who's a listener who had a Ron Paul sign he loves Ron Paul the guy was
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:19.000]  hit by a car and his brain damaged and they went over and beat up a crippled
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.280]  old man I mean these people are trash I'm sorry I don't want to go off on a
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:26.960]  rant no hey I'm worthy on that brother but you notice they wouldn't do that to
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:30.480]  somebody they didn't feel like they could take advantage of and that's that's
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:33.720]  sad to me I wish I would have been there with Ronnie I would have been more than
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:38.640]  happy to have made sure his sign was a good in place well what does that say
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:43.320]  about him we wouldn't know you would never attack the weak but with these
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:46.920]  people that's their instinct is to attack the weak well of course I mean
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:52.680]  you had one guy on there talking about paying for abortions I mean you so
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:56.080]  you're going to get involved in something like that and we can go on a
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:59.040]  completely different subject matter but I mean you're talking about some of it
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:02.840]  it will take advantage of the the most helpless thing on the face of the
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:07.840]  planet and that's that I'm not okay with yeah they get off on killing babies
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:10.640]  because it makes them feel powerful these people are demons I didn't mean to
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:14.920]  distract off one last question I know you're gonna send one of these down tell
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:19.620]  us about the Triton billet pistol that that is an awesome I mean that's
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:24.400]  something I would carry in my truck yeah the Triton series pistol that we
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:29.200]  make it a seven-and-a-half inch barrel and we make it in a ten-and-a-half inch
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:36.520]  barrel comes with a sick brace or at least one type of arm brace for it that
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:39.200]  has been it's the same thing it's funny you say carrying a truck that's what I
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:45.960]  keep in my truck as well it's it's very compact it's very easy to utilize I'm
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:50.760]  sure you're gonna get flooded with emails as we are you do need to utilize
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:56.640]  that weapon as it is intended purpose with the brace so that it's been pushed
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:01.280]  and pushed and pushed with ATF there are laws if you take the brace off well
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:04.880]  you can take the brace off that you can't shoulder the brace that's right
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:08.520]  I can't shoulder it correct you're only supposed to use it for its intended
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:14.400]  purpose is what the ATF has explained that explained the the fine details
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:19.320]  like I have one here I didn't know this just came in wow look at this because
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:23.920]  Walden was telling me do not shoulder the brace explain that to me yeah so when
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:29.400]  Sid came out with this they basically said we're making this as a pistol and
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:34.320]  the brace fits around your arm and it's to stabilize then I got flooded with
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:40.000]  questions of you know can we shoulder it you know and the ATF kind of they
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.720]  really just didn't address it they just kind of backed away from it a little bit
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:46.720]  well they continue to get inundated with calls and emails and they finally had to
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:50.640]  come out and say do not shoulder it is intended as a pistol when you shoulder it
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.280]  they're saying that it turns into a short bell rifle which turns it into a
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:00.360]  NFA weapon that you have to buy a tax stamp for yes so I I guess that's a
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:05.240]  different level of firearms and then you have to go basically jump to the hoops
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:09.040]  and go through an ATF background check and buy the tax stamp if you wanted to
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:12.840]  shoulder this that's correct correct you would then turn it into a short bell
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.040]  rifle which then you could put any kind of stock on it you wanted you could take
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:22.520]  that brace off and of course that's all just baloney from Diane Feinstein I mean
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:27.520]  the problem's not the gun or the rifle or the problems the criminals yeah that's
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:33.440]  the same thing I mean that you know my truck has not ran over anybody ever and
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:36.880]  if I leave it parked out there it probably won't do anything but just sit
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:41.040]  there so it's the people that are that are utilizing these things that's the
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:45.720]  real that's the real problem with people making bad board decisions or
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:50.680]  making poor choices so it when it really boils down to it education of the
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:55.160]  people and I am a huge proponent of that I would like to see everybody in the
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:00.720]  world be educated and understand how valuable their second amendment rights
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:04.560]  are and how they need to utilize them and how they need to be safe when they do
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:10.240]  all right well Lee Queen thank you so much for the great work HD firearms

[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:38.880]  exciting one last question about the shorter rifle that with the seven inch
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.360]  barrel versus the two inch barrel what's the accuracy of this versus one of
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:47.280]  your longer barrels on the seven and a half inch barrel it's really more of a
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:51.160]  close-in gun the ten and a half inch you'll still be good out to two to
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:58.440]  300 yards comparison you're going to get far better accuracy on a 16 inch to 18
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:02.840]  inch barrel than you will anything else just just for a matter how you can
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.400]  control a little bit better it's a little more forgiving and long ranges so
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.600]  if you're going to shoot more long-range stuff anything you know 25 yards out to
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:14.560]  500 yards I would definitely recommend a 16 inch minimum all right well I can't

[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:13.160]  seeing it last night up here they were going through the hours of footage
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:20.160]  Alex Jones here back live we have the communists kicking and punching a
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:27.080]  handicap you know like 65 year old guy and then there's another person on a
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:32.880]  cane who they attack it's like wolves they see injured old people and they
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:36.640]  start attacking them I just watching the footage how they'll sneak up like rats
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:40.800]  and then hit and kick somebody for no reason and then run over the cops and go
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:51.360]  I was assaulted I was assaulted vermin dishonorable scum in fact I need to stop
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:54.000]  thinking about people like that it makes me very angry I'm gonna be honest
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.840]  everybody I'm just so sick of scum and I'll tell you these people rule over us
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:05.000]  now I'm tired of it I'm sick of it I didn't mean to start going off into a
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.040]  rant we were talking about that footage during the break and I want to get due if
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:11.680]  he can get the other clips of them attacking us and then link it up with
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.920]  the other footage and then them you know say they want to kill their kids and
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:22.160]  all that oh yeah actual babies I pay for it I love it I love Satan really sick
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:32.960]  really sick people all right let me get into the news let me just get in some
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:39.160]  goodness first first or hyperventilating free range Maryland family cleared of
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:43.580]  child neglect remember we first talked about that story the 10 kids no
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:47.520]  criminal record no problems Facebook folks thought it was weird that they
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.840]  lived on a farm by themselves and so they came and took all their kids they
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.120]  were unvaccinated now the Washington Post reports that they have been cleared
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:58.000]  of any wrongdoing and the children have been released I could take one look at
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.520]  the hundreds of photos on their Facebook that those kids were living in an
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:08.920]  idyllic situation those kids look so much better than the average kids I see
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:17.680]  New York Times Trumpets US restraining against ISIS ignores hundreds of
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:23.400]  civilians deaths and you can see the media saying don't attack ISIS that's
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:27.840]  because it's a it's a it's a real enemy funded by Saudi Arabia taking over
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:31.080]  that's why they're not being attacked I mean as if our military couldn't take
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:37.040]  out a hundred you know cars drive a hundred Toyota's driving on the road
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:43.040]  and it's come out that they're being protected sick here's another story this

[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:01.160]  going to be getting out that are connected to petrochemicals and things
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:06.640]  so that's a big victory on that front despite Border Patrol's best efforts
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:11.400]  our border is still wide open a Bangor Daily News report very detailed
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.120]  more patrol agents are further hampered by Obama administration's open border
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:18.320]  policy and when they bust people including drug dealers are just told
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:24.240]  release them she should go read that report it's on info wars.com this is
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:30.320]  some good news but also bad news out of tech dirt Obama administration at first
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:35.120]  well here it is obtained emails show FBI's general counsel briefly concerned

[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:48.920]  some halfway sane people in the government that's just that little
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:54.120]  stack of news there's no kidding like 25 other stacks here let's get into this

[01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:01.960]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:06.680]  and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30 40

[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:36.840]  Alex Jones there are so many video clips I haven't gotten to today ahead of Mr.
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:40.520]  Dent joining us on the economy I played this one but I'm tempted to play it
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:44.720]  again it's up on info wars.com candidate Obama debates President Obama on
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:49.040]  government surveillance mayor de Blasso blames gang on game violence for recent
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:57.720]  crime spike in New York you know the police have been slow rolling and not
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:03.120]  talking to community people in Baltimore and in New York and other areas in crime
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:06.960]  was just exploding and I mean that's the issue yeah you've got some of these
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:12.080]  crime-infested areas that end up having the worst police because it's just a
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:16.760]  culture of crime but then you compare the police to the street thugs there's
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:22.320]  just no comparison and that's the problem is that George Soros again I keep
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:25.800]  explaining this because people don't understand George Soros wants to make a
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:30.240]  revolution against local government to smash local government to bring in the
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.960]  feds it's an easy equation it's a communist playbook from the Nazi
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:41.400]  collaborator who can make this up a Nazi collaborator that funds
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:45.560]  anti-free speech initiatives and overthrowing Ukraine to put fascist in
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:50.600]  and whose funding left his communist to go after the police so the police only
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:54.120]  militarized worse and see the public as the enemy everything blows up in our
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:02:00.280]  face I mean how obvious is this have to get people and then the minority of
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:04.240]  folks and I don't mean race-wise I mean a minority of people go you just love to
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:09.640]  worship the police oh yeah that's why I made four films about how out of control
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:14.080]  the police were because of the feds and the training and the culture change I
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:20.760]  tried to stop this from all happening and now I'm trying to stop the next phase
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:25.920]  and you know I'll probably fail and then all you idiots can kill each other but
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:30.920]  I'm not gonna be part of it I can tell you that right now
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:35.840]  see I'm getting really angry everybody knows it's not an act when I get like
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:39.360]  this I've been on the air for two hours now the stuff starts to get to me and
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:43.480]  then physiologically I just start getting pissed off so let me just try to
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:52.440]  settle down for a minute there we go I mean we're sitting on top of a communist
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:56.680]  revolution in this country basically with cities burning and the culprits
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:00.880]  running around are trying to shut my showdown and harassing me people like
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:06.520]  George Soros and media matters and I'm tired of it I mean if you are actively
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.320]  engaging these people folks you know how real they were because they'd be in your
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:13.840]  face and I just I just cannot believe America accepts the domination of the
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:21.320]  scum here's the headline leaking Fukushima containers could lead to
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:26.120]  hydrogen explosions that's in Japan and I have another report that I meant to
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:33.080]  send an eco but I didn't but it was dealing with China is to build a whole
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:37.240]  bunch of really dangerous reactors and even their own government part of the
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:41.440]  government saying don't do it and here's my issue I'm all for nuclear power if
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:45.520]  you could run it right and that they weren't always leaking and blowing up
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:49.160]  the northern hemisphere of this world I was saying double the radiation that it
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:55.880]  wasn't the 40s it's triple and so the issue is they don't retire the plants
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:59.560]  after they're supposed to be retired these corporations the the leaders just
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:04.080]  want profits now and won't run these things properly and they don't even
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:10.160]  build new designs of them I'm all for innovation folks but not the way it's
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.640]  going containers holding contaminated water at the Kripple Fukushima nuclear
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:18.240]  power plant are at risk of hydrogen explosions with 10% of them found to be
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:22.680]  leaking as many as 333 containers may be defective according to TEPCO it's just
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:28.600]  an ongoing meltdown and again can you guys try to forget the exact headline I
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.800]  meant to I am it to you but it didn't come through Nico it was a headline about
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:37.520]  China building questionable reactors I think was the headline they just
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:42.240]  green-lighted it a whole bunch of them leaking Fukushima containers here's
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:47.000]  this other one nuclear official warrants of explosions of Fukushima plant gasses
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.680]  accumulating and sediment underneath how the timid water spark caused by
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:54.880]  static electricity could ignite hydrogen blast that's what blew up the max mox
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:58.480]  reactor that had plutonium in it the big mushroom at Fukushima
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:02.840]  president Obama has said in the past that we must find the proper balance
[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:06.760]  between security of our nation and the privacy of our citizens but with the
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.520]  numerous whistleblowers coming out including but not limited to Edward
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:14.720]  Snowden Wayne Madsen and of course William Benny who tell us that the NSA
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:18.360]  is doing more than checking al-Qaeda's Gmail accounts it's about time that
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:23.280]  somebody held the president's feet to the fire appearing on CBS Rand Paul noted
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.160]  here's the thing about the president he's disingenuous about this the
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:31.080]  president started this program through executive order he could end it any time
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:35.680]  the senator also noted that the NSA bulk collection was recently ruled
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:40.680]  illegal by a federal appellate panel why doesn't he stop it what's he waiting
[02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:46.280]  for mr. Paul said he says oh Congress can stop it he started it on his own he
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:50.160]  should stop it and I've asked the president repeatedly stopped the program
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:55.160]  but as we all know that hasn't happened you can find more reports on the Alex

[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:11.200]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest

[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:18.920]  resistance rallying Patriots Worldwide
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:29.280]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show one thing China has proven is that they
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:33.480]  have some of the most lax controls on chemical plants manufacturing you name
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:39.960]  it Foxcom with suicide nets forced abortions their rivers routinely catch
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:44.760]  on fire we have completely clean coal power plants in the United States and
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:48.400]  Canada that put on nothing but water vapor and carbon dioxide that's why they
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:51.680]  passed laws to tax those well they didn't pass laws
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:55.880]  Obama just said so and taxes them and regulates them to quote bankrupt them in
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:02.000]  his words but China builds multiple new plants a week with no controls no
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:08.160]  scrubbers just a plant water turbines and the stats well linen guardian reports
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:13.080]  China warned over insane plans for new nuclear power plants I mentioned how
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:21.480]  300 plus containment areas of TEPCO believes may start blowing up at Fukushima
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:25.160]  again I've never been against nuclear power except these corporations don't
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:29.640]  run these things properly and don't retire plants I mean they run these
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:33.400]  plants like you'd run your frat house there's like beer bottles laying around
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:39.760]  except they're radioactive a China warned he zoom you I think you pronounce it a
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.120]  leading Chinese scientists says the country is not investing enough in
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:48.480]  safety controls after lifting the post Fukushima disaster reactor band and it
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:52.320]  goes on he ran the country's nuclear weapons programs you name it and says
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:56.520]  that they're gonna build scores of these plants basically on the same type of
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:10:03.080]  designs the US had 40 years ago I mean this is a disaster in the making
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:06.800]  they'll read the London Guardian investigative report and I only mentioned
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:12.160]  that because it shows the above-the-law nature of governments take the Clintons
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:17.160]  hundreds of millions of dollars the last decade of charity money they kept for
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:21.800]  private jets and mansions and foreign dictators giving them money London
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:26.240]  Guardian against reporting on this shows associated press Clinton Foundation
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:31.040]  donors got weapons deals from Hillary Clinton's State Department she give
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:34.520]  money to Hillary Clinton and then she says we can give weapons to this country
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:40.360]  billions of dollars I mean just unprecedented corruption because they're
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:44.800]  getting away with it now Harry Dent's been coming on the show I don't know five
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:48.040]  years or so and he's the best-selling author made a lot of big predictions in
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:52.200]  the 80s and 90s was one of the top guys at Maine Capitol he's a routine guest
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:55.960]  folks you know who he is Harry Dent research comm Harry Dent comm Ford
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:59.720]  slash Alex Jones to find some specials and deals on his books that he's kind of
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:04.240]  off our listeners but I wanted to get him on because he's the author of the
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:10.360]  demographic cliff and the editor of the free newsletter economy and markets and
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:13.120]  I won't go over his whole bio and where he's worked and what he's done folks know
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:18.920]  he's a prestigious guy but he did accurately predict that we would see
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:26.240]  starting last year global depressionary curves and we're now seeing that but
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:30.720]  you've got the queuing unlimited and the race the bottom so you've got inflation
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:34.840]  and luxury goods and some other areas so it's almost a perfect storm at least
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:39.000]  what I'm seeing in Austin where stuff does cost more money but at the same
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:45.080]  time there is a depression in all the businesses I know people have and in
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:49.680]  talk radio and everything I mean it's demographic I guess the only growth
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:53.760]  area is going to be in medicine and stuff like that so we've seen a lot of
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:58.000]  developments now where they admit the economy is growing at 0.2 that's with
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.640]  cook numbers Ron Paul agree with me we're probably shrinking at 2 to 3%
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:07.080]  that's a depression so I wanted to get Mr. Denon to give us his global view on
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:12.920]  the state of the world and and where we are planetary on a planetary scale but
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:18.200]  also in a regional scale and what things like TPP and you know these
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:21.600]  unelected boards having more and more control mean what it means when
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.200]  corruption seems to be at all-time highs and there's no enforcement but the
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.440]  very Justice Department that won't go after Hillary is going after the global
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:35.360]  soccer league I mean it just seems like a train wreck they won't regulate
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:41.360]  properly nuclear power plants but they'll harass big wigs and soccer it
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:46.800]  seems like the Tea Party from Alice in Wonderland Harry Dent research calm
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:50.240]  Harry Dent that's kind of a gestalt I threw out there what do you want to
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:55.360]  tackle first we know Alex I'll just start with you know we've been saying
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:13:00.800]  that this year the economy would be weaker than been forecast economists
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:04.120]  just extrapolate past trends in the future and say oh we're about to reach
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:09.680]  escape velocity we look at demographics demographics told us in the late 80s that
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:14.200]  Japan was going to collapse it tells us that Germany is going to be the worst
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:19.280]  hit single country in the next decade and nobody expects that it says that the
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.920]  affluent in the United States who are the last part of our economy still
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.000]  spending because they go to school later their kids go to school later they
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.240]  peak and spending later they're getting ready to drop off especially in 2015
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:38.760]  forward so so everybody's looking for this you know endless QE to turn into
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:41.440]  something when first of all it's something for nothing I don't know how
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:45.040]  anybody gets that you could create money out of thin air trillions of dollars
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:49.640]  and solve any real problems all you do is keep the bubble going that government
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:54.040]  started in the 80s and 90s and the more the bubble goes when it finally burst
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:58.280]  it's going to be more painful for everybody and China you were talking
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:03.680]  about China earlier I've said over and over again US doesn't even know what a
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:07.440]  bubble is compared to what China's done because China's government has had the
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:13.400]  most control and impact over their economy they have overbuilt condos and
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:19.640]  housing 27% industrial capacity 30 40 50 percent all other types of
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:25.760]  infrastructures they've moved 250 million people in the last 12 years no
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:29.520]  skills from rural areas and they just haven't built stuff for nobody I mean
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:34.000]  I mean they're building all these empty condos in cities in ghost cities and
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:39.760]  stuff so so China is the biggest bubble and what I'm seeing as an update Alex
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:43.640]  from last time I've gone is you know the markets are finally kind of getting in a
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:47.960]  confused state they've just been up with all this free money coming in and
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:51.520]  pumping them up there's nowhere else for investors to go but starting in
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:55.960]  December of last year they've gone sideways and the reason is there is a
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:01.720]  disconnect between the economy in the US and what stocks are assuming earnings
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:06.240]  are slowing retail sales have slowed dramatically I've got to interrupt you
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:09.120]  and hand it to you I wish I had the staff to do us I have a great crew but
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:13.400]  they're always too busy on breaking news you were on a year ago six months ago
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:18.880]  you literally said by the middle of next year it'll be clear that the growth is
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:22.960]  dead it'll be clear that it's stagnating it'll be clear that we're not hitting
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:26.720]  escape velocity we had almost all the other economists saying the opposite so
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:30.280]  I I wish your crew would go back to those interviews and get the clips out we
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:34.560]  play them next time you came on because you really are making accurate
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:39.200]  predictions here yeah and again we just got good simple tools we're not doing
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:44.320]  anything magic or complicated we know from cradle to grave when people spend
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:48.960]  money on everything when they enter the workforce become workers and consumers
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:52.920]  when they buy their first house their largest house their first car their
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:58.760]  their luxury car when they spend money on child care I mean camping equipment
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:03.360]  even potato chips so what we do is not a mystery we look at the predictable things
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:07.840]  people do as a age from the macro I've got I've got a graph you guys have it's
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.040]  called the spending wave it's just moves for the birth index in the United
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:16.080]  States especially for the large baby boom generation 46 years that's when the
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:20.600]  average person spends the most money in their entire life and you see all the
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:24.440]  way back to the 50s how close a correlation with economy and you can
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:28.640]  predict this we can project out as you can see in this class almost five decades
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:34.120]  but note the red line here presently because of quantitative easing in
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:38.400]  response to the slowing of baby boom spending from 2008 forward something we
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:42.440]  predicted decades before the same week predicted for the class in Japan and I
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:47.400]  this the stock market is just going ballistic way off the fundamentals the
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:51.560]  markets just going up because investors are buying it that's with free money
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:55.320]  from the Fed there's nowhere else to go with investment so there's a huge
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:17:00.320]  disconnect and so the real economy is stalling in the disconnect the folks
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:04.000]  that are heavily in stocks are still euphoric but there is a feeling as I
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:09.160]  said of wonderland am I right to say when it's artificial when it crashes it'll
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:13.200]  be that much worse yeah you can see in that graph we've never diverged this
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:16.840]  much so the next crash will be much worse than the last one the last one was
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:21.520]  was substantial I call this Alex the market on crack the market just like a
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:25.200]  person on crack you're not going to make good decisions people on crack thing
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:29.680]  drop off a roof and fly that's where the stock market that but again I'll tell
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:34.120]  you where it's worse in China China has been slowing their real estate which
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:39.680]  we've been predicting for a long time finally going down slowly at first but
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:43.640]  in their economy keeps slowing but guess what their stock market's gone up
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:47.320]  almost a hundred fifty percent in the last year in other words their economy is
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:51.880]  clearly slowing and their markets going up the reason for this is the Chinese
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:56.120]  who've been speculating in real estate more than any investors in the world
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:00.600]  they're huge savers they love real estate now that real estate's going down
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:05.200]  they've all of a sudden switched over to speculating in stock something they
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:09.320]  don't even normally do so this stock market is in a huge disconnect so so
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:14.400]  we're setting up I think in the next few months and most for the markets to
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:19.480]  finally get this disconnect and we see a crash that the Federal Reserve and
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:24.680]  central banks can't just solve with more money I tell you real estate in China
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:28.360]  starts going down like I think it's going to go down the next year to the
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:33.120]  wealthy there have so much in that there's no amount of stimulus the Chinese
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:37.080]  government or the US government can do the counteract that let me ask you this
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:41.040]  question what will a Chinese implosion then as a guesstimation or dead reckoning
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:45.440]  look like and how will it affect the rest of the world economy well first of
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:49.920]  all now they've drawn their their their everyday investors into stocks in addition
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:54.200]  to real estate so they got two major bubbles to burst and China's was the
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:58.480]  greatest bubble to burst last time around it'd be greater this time so their
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:04.160]  economy implodes their economy has more income inequality even in the US does we
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:10.400]  lead the west and world in this the top 10 percent of Chinese households control
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:15.920]  60% of the consume of the income and consumer spending they own almost all
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:20.280]  the real estate so when real estate implodes their wealth will implode when
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:23.800]  their wealth implodes they will stop spending they will stop buying real
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:27.320]  estate and not just in China what I'm just getting ready to do a report for
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:33.120]  our newsletter coming up where we look at how the Chinese the wealthy Chinese are
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:37.760]  fleeing in droves the Chinese government does not allow you to take more

[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:46.120]  short segment Harry I want to get back to the big question here I know a lot of
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:49.840]  people worth $500 million a hundred million dollars a billion dollars four
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:52.760]  million dollars ten million dollars I live here in Austin a lot of them live
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:58.320]  here and I know some in New York and some out into California they've all
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:02.520]  been freaked out for a decade but the last five years they've been really
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:07.280]  moving into rural areas they've been leaving to New Zealand they have been
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:10.520]  getting out of the country and when I first talked about this folks said no
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:13.440]  they're not leaving because of a collapse you're being a fair monger
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:18.160]  really I talked to folks that knew James Cameron and when he left I'd already
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:22.440]  been told he was leaving to New Zealand permanently leaving okay so so you
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:26.960]  understand something the elite are every billionaire has left Israel the
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:30.280]  last six years they've moved to Switzerland and London in places like
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:34.040]  that so I'm kind of taking up the segment here ranting we got an article
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:40.560]  about elites building safe rooms bunkers armored redoubts mr. Dent what is
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:46.080]  going on with this well you know the smart money always acts first and in no
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:50.720]  place more than China the wealthy in China are leaving in droves and what
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:54.200]  they're doing since their government says you can only take $50,000 out of
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:58.360]  you they said oh we're not leaving we're just moving to Irvine California or
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:03.960]  New York City or Boston or somewhere or London or Melbourne Australia we're
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:07.840]  just going to get our kids in a good college for two years we'll be back and
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:11.520]  oh by the way while we're there we got to buy a place so they buy the most
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:15.520]  expensive house or condominium they can because they're laundering money they're
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:20.040]  getting their money out of the country so that when things do fall apart because
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:24.160]  they know the Chinese bubble can't last listen a nice restaurant in Austin or
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:28.600]  or I've been with folks out on a fancy golf course it's it's it's rich Chinese
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:32.480]  everywhere I mean they're just evacuating I'm sorry I'm ranting well you
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:35.640]  know but this happened in the late 80s when Japanese had the big bubble in
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:39.520]  real estate they were making obscene profits and they were using those profits
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:43.160]  to go buy real estate arrest the way around the world it's the Chinese that
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:47.880]  are propping up most big city markets with these 20 million 100 million
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:53.400]  condos which are just insanely overvalued rich people in general there
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:56.640]  aren't many places they can park that much money it's either got to be a
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:02.400]  Picasso painting or you know a $13,000 per square foot condo in Manhattan or
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:06.160]  something so this is what's happening everywhere this real estate bubble
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:11.080]  globally is going to be burst when the Chinese stop the Russians have been doing
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:14.640]  this too but their ruble collapse so they can't do this anymore the
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.040]  Brazilians economy has been collapsing along with commodity prices we've been
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:23.160]  predicting would go down Middle East is being hurt by falling oil prices and
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:27.400]  civil unrest so it's really the Chinese are the last people doing this and you're
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:31.840]  right the smart people in the US they see this coming the smart people in China
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:35.760]  see this coming so we want you to think like the smart money we want your
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:40.640]  audience people listening don't listen to your everyday friends or listen to you
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:44.200]  know the typical media saying everything's okay and Janet Yellen is going
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:49.880]  to make everything okay there's no way they can stop this stampede let me ask
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:52.080]  you that question I'm gonna come out give me the floor to break more of this
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:56.680]  down in the next long segment you will tell people what's going on and some
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:01.760]  other people will warn folks why won't the average successful person want to
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:05.280]  warn the general public is it because they want to have time to position
[02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:09.840]  themselves while still making money on the bubble before it implodes no no I
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:13.120]  think I think even most successful business people don't get like you
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:19.400]  say it's really the really smart money the top point one percent to see this
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:22.160]  sort of thing I mean the typical millionaire is not going to see it
[02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:29.640]  people are in bubble logic I mean I just lay this stuff out it's just back
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:33.920]  everything's in a bubble they say it's not a bubble and this economist has not
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:37.960]  a bubble I throw up the thing and say it looks like a bubble class like a bubble
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:42.560]  it's a bubble this is the most bubbly time the only more one was a check bubble
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:47.000]  and you can't compare to that does that happen so you're saying it's bubble
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.800]  get bubble get my gotta go on the march bubble get the empires right down the
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:57.040]  graphs Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:03.120]  a hearing schedule for today will focus on whether two chimpanzees held by
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:07.280]  Stony Brook University are property of the university or must be set free
[02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:12.040]  champions of the concept of speciism like Peter Singer argue that the chimps
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:16.040]  should have human rights because they are quote comparable to three-year-old
[02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:20.160]  humans and their capacity for self-awareness unquote the problem is
[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:24.960]  singer has argued that Down's syndrome children should be euthanized because
[02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:29.320]  quote they will never be able to play the guitar or develop an appreciation of
[02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:33.040]  science fiction learn a foreign language or chat with us about the latest

[02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:31.280]  expert to take on that but I've had dr. Paul Craig Roberts on former head of

[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:42.480]  John Williams has broken it all down two to three percent actual negative and
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:45.640]  that's with all this unlimited money printing which they say is coming to an
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:49.480]  unknown that's true we'll talk to dent in a moment and get into why the elites
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:55.200]  are bunkering down or are fleeing the West or or or any other bubble zone but
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:59.160]  briefly I saw this this morning and it takes us four days to turn around a new
[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:05.200]  shirt printed up right here in America a lot of our shirts are cotton from America
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:11.000]  printed in America sewn in America but if people want a really inexpensive they
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.720]  come from Mexico and places like that then they're printed in America this
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:16.840]  shirt will be it'll take me a month to get it made to America we're going to
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:21.560]  have a version that's made in America as well but regardless it gets the word
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:26.680]  out a pack son pulled upside down flag t-shirt because it hurts someone's
[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:30.720]  feelings and this is a leftist organization I would imagine I did it to
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:34.920]  like down with America or something and James Woods the actor with his
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:38.960]  millions of Twitter followers started a big boycott of it so they pulled the
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:43.000]  shirt well I don't know that's a good idea I mean let people do what they
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  want but I thought hey I already had an idea for an up down upside down American
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:53.080]  flag shirt because under federal law under US code when the country's in
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:58.240]  crisis when a ship's in crisis when you're in distress you fly the flag
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:02.000]  upside down the flag should be flown upside down the borders are open and
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.960]  world governments being announced and the president's acting more and more like
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:08.800]  a dictator so we're gonna have a limited edition if I limited edition I'm gonna
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:13.240]  put it out for I'll put it out to the end of the year the announcement's made
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:19.080]  and then we'll never make it again it's a save America shirt and it simply if
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:22.840]  you're a radio listener I'll describe it you can go to info wars.com to see it
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:28.280]  and then it also funds our operation to help save America it says in big bold
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:33.040]  letter save America so people can understand what we're saying so you
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:37.040]  don't get in a fist fight then under it the American flag in black and white is
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:44.080]  upside down and under that says United States flag code title 4 chapter 1 the
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:49.160]  flag should never be displayed with the Union down except as an signal of the
[02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:54.840]  dire distress and instances of extreme danger or life of property now is the
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:58.720]  time to fly the flag upside down when folks get mad at you say listen I love
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:02.560]  this country are we in distress they go yes that's what you're supposed to do we
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:06.680]  need to get people's attention and I'm gonna wear this flag I'm sure the
[02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:12.440]  media will attack me and I'll say really the country is in an emergency what the
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:17.240]  flag stands for is on fire we got communists every week burning American
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:21.520]  flags blocking the highway down here and attacking old people and stuff they
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:27.440]  don't even get in trouble the country's in trouble folks and I'm tired of it so
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:30.960]  the save America flag we're gonna sell this through the rest of 2015 will help
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:34.520]  support the info war and when they're gone they're gone and we will print this
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:38.520]  with a made America version and another one made in Mexico or whatever where we
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:41.440]  get them the quickest but we've got black t-shirts in stock ready to print them
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:44.080]  they're gonna start printing them in the next two days they'll ship them to us
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:49.520]  from what is it Georgia again and they'll be here by next week and we will
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:56.480]  ship them out to you order today infowarstore.com infowarstore.com in
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:37:00.160]  the regular Patriot Apparel section some of the stuff in there's made in
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:04.680]  America if you go to maiden1776.com that's the all hundred percent made
[02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:08.440]  America section of the site and so the shirts costing 50 bucks like made
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.840]  America they cost 20 to 25 they they're a lot less I mean a
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:18.480]  ball cap made America cost us 10 12 bucks made in China $1 made Mexico $2 so
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:22.160]  we just offer both you want to save money get it from Mexico or whatever we
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:26.160]  got it you want to get it from here we got it it doesn't to be better quality
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:31.560]  made America but to get this out quick it's not made in the US it is printed
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:34.680]  here in the US but that doesn't matter the point is get the shirts support the
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:40.240]  info war this will cause conversations on the front it says save America now
[02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:44.080]  it states flag code so people say hey what's that mean and you go well means
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:47.520]  you know the company's in the stress was flat upside down here's the law say see
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:51.960]  the back on the back it says our republic is in distress upside down flag
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:58.720]  ask me why info wars.com and it's time to warn people folks always say we should
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:02.320]  start a movement to fly flags upside down well the problem with that is most
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:06.240]  people don't fly flag except on Memorial Day or Fourth of July and your
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:10.160]  neighbors don't understand what's happening this is a great way to get
[02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:14.320]  that conversation going it's the whole point of the apparel we have is to start
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:18.640]  conversations and wear your colors proud and now is the time to start wearing the
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:25.360]  flag upside down and you know getting those conversations going all right
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:30.120]  going back to Harry Dent I'll add one more time here I want to talk about this
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:34.640]  briefly and then I'll have the floor with a balance of the hour you you hear
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:39.720]  these ads and I'm not against them it's okay we're get your heirloom seeds free
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:44.600]  just shipping charge you call it's $10 well to ship those seeds and handling
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:51.120]  $4 to $5 okay fine why don't you just say $10 shipping included and then you
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:55.440]  really selling seeds for five bucks I just don't like marketing schemes that
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:00.800]  that aren't real this is real a book this size I went and checked $3 media mail
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:03.920]  I don't even know if he ships it that way may ship it even better and then at
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:07.880]  least $2 for a shipping department handling the rest of it you count the
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:11.800]  cost of a book I bet the demographic cliff cost probably $3 $4 a
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:16.040]  print the he's losing money and I know he's a successful writer it is a best
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:21.480]  seller so I got to ask Mr. Harry S Dent Jr. how are you offering a book where
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:24.320]  you lose money on it when it's already a best seller do you just want to get it
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:27.920]  out to folks because everybody should take advantage of this at Harry Dent
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:33.520]  book.com yeah we do actually we buy the book from the publisher so it's more
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:37.960]  than $3 so we lose money on the book and we break even on the shipping we just
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:42.520]  know that people get to know us somehow it'll benefit them and us down the road
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:47.000]  that's you know so this is just hey you hear this it sounds interesting you're
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:50.680]  not going to have conviction in what I'm saying until you go in this book and
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:55.320]  look at our four key indicators and look at everything we're saying look at how
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:58.760]  the Japanese economy collapsed when we say it would how the rest of the world
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:02.400]  is following in their footsteps I mean here like you say I go in a whole
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:07.000]  chapter on this we've got that demographic cycle I showed earlier
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.480]  generation spending and not that's the top one we got next I came up years
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:15.840]  later with a geopolitical cycle every 18 years thing of things are great in the
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:20.280]  world like 83 to 2000 and then we had 9-11 and they've been terrible ever
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:25.000]  since the geopolitical cycle is going to continue to get worse for the next five
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.480]  years so anybody thinks all this terrorism and civil wars and Russian
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:33.920]  Ukraine is over this stuff's only going to get worse and stock markets tend to be
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:38.520]  at half the valuations in a negative cycle so this is another reality the
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:42.800]  market's not getting third innovation cycle we've seen the best of the
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:47.080]  internet not that innovation is going to stop but innovations matter when they
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:51.120]  move fully mainstream and affect everyday people not just niche markets
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:56.680]  where everybody's got the internet and broadband and an iPad and iPhone and a
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:41:01.480]  smartphone and this and that and and so we've seen the best games and that but
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:06.840]  finally the most potent cycle I found and only about three years ago is a boom
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:11.240]  bus cycle that I used to follow on a wrote ten-year cycle and I finally found
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:16.480]  out was actually tracked to Sunspot cycles and Sunspot cycles are great
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:22.000]  because nobody understands them and number two scientists actually focus on
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.680]  predicting these cycles they're not ten years on average like the overall boom
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:30.960]  cycles have been in the last century they're 8 to 13 years so you have to get
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:35.280]  them right and there's serious scientists that do and they predicted the last
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:41.280]  Sunspot cycle with peak in November December of 2013 I'm in 14 and at peak
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:48.720]  in February of 2015 so that that's great for me and in this this cycle all four
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:53.160]  these point down at the same time this only happened once in a generation it
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:56.840]  was the early to mid 70s this happened that was the worst crisis we had back
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:00.760]  then the worst stock crash the worst recession and then of course the early
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:05.560]  30s the Great Depression hit when all four of these cycles are down so my my
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:10.960]  research has evolved from demographics but I found the other factors that really
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:15.320]  really matter and when all these four cycles point down you need to understand
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:19.120]  this you need to protect the assets you've grained out of this ball talk
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:22.040]  about how you do that and I want you to walk through this we're putting on
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:27.080]  screen an article from six years ago London Guardian where their Ministry of
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:30.640]  Defense came out the reports linked revolution flashmob's brain chips a
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.760]  grim vision of the future their military actually says everything you're
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:39.520]  saying our Pentagon and in deeper reports says what you're saying the truth is
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:44.960]  as you said the top you know one percent of the one percent do understand
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:50.240]  this they won't tell the public I want to ask you why I mean I wish this wasn't
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:54.520]  true but undoubtedly unless everything changes with all their weird computers and
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:59.920]  manipulation we're going there but now we see the signs of it before we go there
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:05.720]  let me ask you this Mr. Dent what in your view is the real economy rate if they
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:10.980]  say at 0.2 percent well we just put out an issue of our newsletter where we
[02:43:10.980 --> 02:43:14.560]  pretty much said it looks like we're already in recession starting in
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:19.080]  December or January and markets are acting like everything's fine they're
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:24.360]  looking at lagging indicators like jobs and housing those are the last things to
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:28.520]  go the leading indicators capital investment things like that have been
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:32.040]  going down retail sales have been miserable and they keep blaming on the
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:36.720]  weather well the cold weather is months behind us and they're still slow so
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:40.040]  we're looking at the indicators that matter now and they're saying we're not
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:43.600]  really coming out of this in fact it looks like we're going deeper in
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:48.960]  recession so again nobody can say this when I go on normal news programs
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:52.800]  financial news I got two or three minutes and I can't say anything to
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:56.400]  convince anybody everybody else on there has some special interest stock
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:00.480]  brokers can't tell people they'll sell their stocks and run real estate agents
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:04.480]  can't tell people the truth or they won't buy a house no economist can tell
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:09.600]  people the truth so you know that's why the only people I can affect and people
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:12.480]  that want to show like this where I get in front of you for a while and if
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:16.680]  people will actually go to a seminar or read the book because because what I'm
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:21.160]  saying is very contrary so even people who would like to tell people can't
[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:25.480]  because nobody would believe it anyway so that's why we offer this free book I
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:29.760]  want to show another chart you just pulled up again but people don't
[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:34.160]  understand this is something never has happened in history ever since the
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:39.120]  Federal Reserve was created in 1913 they always manipulate short-term interest
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:42.440]  rates you get a slowdown you get a stock crash or anything goes wrong they
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:47.360]  push short-term rates to zero they make money free to help stimulate lending
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:52.440]  those zero short-term rates mainly affect investment because investors will
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:56.960]  use that to leverage up and so that causes speculation what they've never
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:01.440]  done before on a mass scale is what this chart was showing they have pushed long
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:06.200]  term risk-free interest rates this is a ten-year treasury bond the risk-free
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:13.320]  longer-term bond and it used to be before QE you get 2% above this risk-free
[02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:17.840]  rate for taking a ten-year risk now they push this down to zero now people don't
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:23.520]  understand the best economists do if you understand every financial asset real
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:29.680]  estate stocks bonds are directly affected by how low this risk-free rate the
[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:33.840]  difference between two and zero is huge for mortgages and for the value of real
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:38.040]  estate it's huge for the value of stocks when you project the earnings for ten
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:42.400]  years and discount them back to the present by that risk-free rate it's a
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:46.560]  huge difference if it's zero or 2% so what the Federal Reserve and central
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:50.960]  banks have done around the world again unlike any crisis in the past they
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:56.200]  they said the solution to this debt crisis the solution to this giant
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:46:00.800]  financial bubble that they created in the 80s 90s and 2000 is to keep the bubble
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:06.000]  going forever and just to make it more insane so so there's calling this an
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:11.880]  economic or experiment this is insanity to create trillions of dollars in
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:16.320]  pump-up assets way more than they're worth suck everybody into them everybody
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:20.080]  thinks you can't lose money on stocks can't lose money on real estate the
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:24.080]  Federal Reserve won't let them go down when this thing goes down people are
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:28.280]  going to lose money rapidly I remind people that when the tech bubble burst
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:33.320]  burst first I took almost three years to that bubble the first furl of fully
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:38.720]  80% the first 40% happened in the first two and a half months if you don't get
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:42.880]  out of this and protect yourself ahead of time it will be too late that's what
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:47.200]  again that's what the smart money is doing most people will never see this
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:51.800]  coming so it is no more important time to understand what's happening the real
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:57.320]  economy has been unfavorable since late 2007 because of demographics we predict
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:00.760]  that would happen 20 years ago and predicted it would happen before it
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:04.360]  happened in Japan they were the first to go down Europe is next including
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:08.480]  Germany so the fundamentals are bad we had the greatest debt bubble in history
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:16.920]  debt grew at 2.6 times GDP for 25 years from 1983 to 2008 any economist that
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:20.840]  doesn't think that's a problem in a crisis brewing we've never had debt
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:25.960]  grow back that long Harry that is our guest Harry let me ask you this
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:29.880]  question obviously the elites are digging in with the police state they
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:33.940]  think it's going to protect them but if you've got people in the depression
[02:47:33.940 --> 02:47:37.040]  starving to death when they were somewhat self-sufficient what's going to
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:40.760]  happen today with this entitlement society by the middle class by the
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:44.840]  elites by the hundred million people that are on food assistance in the US
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:51.920]  101 million it seems like a perfect storm once this all unravels a b central
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:55.040]  banks have been caught it's in the news they're going to be meeting in a few
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:59.360]  weeks secretly in London to push to ban cash worldwide they've already been
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:04.440]  pushing it openly so so those two points how bad will it get I mean I know it's
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:09.120]  on average I know there's a hundred ways this can happen but how does the
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:17.720]  decadence then the entitlement the the whole just in time to market fragility
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:23.480]  of the system affected and then how does that tie in to the other points that I
[02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:28.040]  was bringing up we know you know this is going to be a global crisis because
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:31.600]  it's a global bubble stocks everywhere real estate everywhere and it's when
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:35.720]  real estate crashes that you get the worst problems because real estate is
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:40.240]  financed and now heavily often with no money down by mortgages so it's heavily
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:45.160]  levered so that's why this the the last down term was so bad because real estate
[02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:48.920]  crash but real estate is yet to crash in most cities around the world so that's
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:52.360]  going to be the first reality it's not just stocks that go down people don't get
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:56.320]  hit as hard when stocks are down real estate goes down the banking system gets
[02:48:56.320 --> 02:49:00.800]  hit people are under water they can't refinance now that the two areas I'm
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.520]  most worried about we already seen Europe go through part of this crisis in
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:09.520]  Japan now for decades those are very civil places with it with with older
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:15.040]  populations and not as much kind of crime and violence I worry about the
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:19.160]  United States because we have a very polarized society the rich have been
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:21.840]  getting richer the poor been getting poorer like you said you got all these
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:26.880]  entitlements build up the top point one percent controls massive amounts of
[02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:32.240]  wealth and then so I think there's going to be that polarized situation is
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:35.400]  going to lead to some level of civil unrest and then of course I'm most
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:40.320]  worried about China for those 250 million people with no skills we're
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:44.200]  going to have to squat in an unfinished apartment and can't even move back to
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:47.440]  the rice paddy they've been paved over with nothing there they're going to be
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:53.240]  trapped and and so so I do think people have to worry not just protect your
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:58.440]  investments where you live you want to live farther out rather than farther in
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:01.840]  you want to live between the Allegheny mountains and the Rocky mountains and
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:06.880]  not on the coast if you can I think we are going to see some level of civil
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:11.040]  unrest even though people can argue oh Japan's been through this for two and
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:14.160]  a half decades and they haven't seen civil unrest well they're an older
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:17.640]  society they got well the Japanese didn't didn't rob each other when their
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:21.240]  country was all bombed to the ground so they act better as when they're
[02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:24.240]  attacked instead of we act worse let's just be honest about it we're going to
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:26.960]  break I want to ask you this question and you're right the elites are moving
[02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:30.120]  off the coast in the middle of the country into the Ozarks and stuff and
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:33.920]  building redoubts I mean that's got to concern people and billionaires are doing
[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:38.680]  that across the board but I want to ask you the White House strategy I know
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:42.400]  you're you know not political on these issues but the White House and Soros and
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:47.360]  others really are trying to get a summer of rage entitlement class warfare
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:50.920]  going when there's some of the most entitled people out there what's the
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:55.920]  strategy behind that with mr. Dent straight ahead you can get his book
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:51:01.000]  free except for $5 495 shipping and handling what's your health worth to
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:04.480]  you you probably can't place an exact value on it but its importance has
[02:51:04.480 --> 02:51:08.040]  certainly increased greatly as you've grown older yet some companies seem to
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:11.920]  believe you can be lured in with cheap prices and false promises that's never
[02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:16.080]  been the way supernatural silver has chosen to do business long ago we set

[02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:40.520]  information private personal information against your will well I found the
[02:53:40.520 --> 02:53:45.280]  answer to their invasive behaviors it's called Dvasive D hyphen or D dash
[02:53:45.280 --> 02:53:50.720] vasive it's made for PCs and androids go get it now at the Google Play Store D
[02:53:50.720 --> 02:54:10.080]  hyphenvasive Dvasive Dvasive it's an app get it now and turn big brother off
[02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:25.800]  I don't want to give up too much info on air but generally if we have some
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:29.960]  intel privately we can just go search it and find it somewhere else in mainstream
[02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:33.480]  news or alternative news or in a c-span statement or something but the whole
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:38.920]  Carnegie Mellon family and their foundations have been moving into
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:45.280]  diversified portfolios into digital into a bunch of other things into farmland
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:50.560]  things like that for quite a while and are predicting a massive crash by the
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:54.040]  end of next year and then I was separately talking to a source about
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:58.800]  this and we did a search and Nico is in there printing it I'd forgotten to do
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:03.200]  this and there's an article mentioning something in that area so all I'm saying
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:07.640]  is the elite are acting like it's the end of the world and then they have
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:10.880]  national news attacking us because we cover this saying we're insane nothing's
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:14.880]  gonna happen everything's fine man I I would love to be wrong but see I'm not
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:20.320]  wrong I'm going off what the big money is doing and that there's even an article
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:26.000]  the future of money BNY Mellon the next generation of currency they're pushing
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:32.080]  there's going to be a collapse go to digital again their global str out of
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:35.600]  the crisis and they've got the big banks openly meeting and pushing and making
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:40.040]  statements about banning cash what's up with the war on cash and how is the
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:44.200]  different arms of the establishment Harry Dent going to try to ride this
[02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:50.240]  crisis into more power we know everybody wants to keep this bubble again it's
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:54.240]  been created for decades now they want to keep it going you can't keep a bubble
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:59.360]  going forever this is an impossible task but people will do desperate things like
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:03.280]  the government just keeps printing more money well every time they have to up the
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:06.840]  ante they have to do double and then triple and that's what the Japanese have
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:11.360]  been doing and now the Europeans and so all of this stuff is strategies that
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:15.440]  just try to keep this going at least until the next administration or the
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:19.320]  next group gets in nobody wants to have the next great depression on their
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:23.680]  watch and you can't blame people for that but that's why nobody's telling you
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:28.400]  the truth and everybody just hopes we can keep this thing going you cannot keep
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:31.480]  this thing going well answer my question and I mean now you like to go off
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:34.720]  scientific stuff and graphs and facts and you make accurate predictions but
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:39.240]  you're a smart guy separately from that they're clearly activating leftist
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:44.400]  good mobs communist race baiters for riots why would the White House just
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:48.600]  department George Soros want to play with fire like that what is the strategy
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:54.560]  there you know I don't know about Soros but but any anybody in the political
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:59.640]  establishment will do what it takes to you know benefit them especially in a
[02:56:59.640 --> 02:57:03.240]  difficult situation so I mean I don't get like you said on the political side
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:07.920]  as much because as soon as I get too political I alienate half the people so
[02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:12.240]  and I just say look I can tell you what's gonna happen over the rest of your
[02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:17.040]  lifetime today our four cycles will show you where the economy said over the
[02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:21.400]  rest of your lifetime your kids lifetime for your business everything so why
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:25.360]  wouldn't you want to know that these are our objective indicators that make
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:30.120]  sense but undoubtedly whether it's this year or next year all hell's getting
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:34.680]  ready to break loose yeah our show in the short term we show that the danger
[02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:40.640]  period is 2015 and 16 and then again in 2018 and 19 those are probably the most
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:44.920]  dangerous years ahead and I think the worst are likely to be in the next two
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:49.320]  so I would agree with that report earlier that by the end of 2016 we're
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:54.520]  likely to see something major occur so you can't afford to wait here and say
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:59.120]  well I'll wait to see and then I'll prepare now you better prepare now

[03:00:06.800 --> 03:00:13.480]  war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[03:00:13.480 --> 03:00:18.040]  alright final segment overdrive harry dent is here with us harry dent book.com
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:22.080]  to get a free copy only 495 that pays for the shipping and handling and then
[03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:24.880]  he loses money because they had to print the books now that's he's losing
[03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:28.480]  probably five dollars he says to buy for the publisher probably like $10 he's
[03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:33.560]  losing but he wants you to read the book it's so important and it's about as
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:36.760]  accurate as you're gonna get following demographics it's what the elite do they
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:40.920]  all know this so we're talking about something that that he's helped you know
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:45.120]  codify so he has trailblazed but quite frankly I read globalist reports
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:48.680]  pentagon reports stuff that carol quickly wrote you know in the 60s and
[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:52.200]  they talk about all this things that rosinski wrote and the four minutes we
[03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:58.240]  have left sir you're saying basically gambling off knowledge you have on the
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:03.720]  market on specific things with money you can lose is one of the most successful
[03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:06.760]  things you could do but most people don't know how to do that so what else
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:12.200]  what would you say to me not individual advice but what would you advise just in
[03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:15.840]  general terms for the general public you know there's a couple areas you know in
[03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:19.200]  a boom you sit there and you sit down with financial advice and say okay how
[03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:24.320]  do I diversify and play the upside well the downside is just the opposite and
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:27.760]  but and it gets more narrow there's fewer things will do well I tell people
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:31.640]  number one thing most people should be doing is just get more of their real
[03:01:31.640 --> 03:01:38.000]  estate and stocks and financial assets in cash cash preserves the value after a
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:41.760]  bubble and then when everything crashes you can buy stuff at 10 20 30 cents on
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:46.560]  the dollar so that's number one just cash and very safe short-term bond number
[03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:50.240]  two we've been saying this for years the dollar benefits from the
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:53.800]  deleveraging of all this debt they're going to be a lot of dollars and debts
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:57.200]  and dollars are going to be destroyed and have been the dollar is going to go
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:01.840]  up not the euro not the Swiss Frank not every other currency now the dollar has
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:05.160]  been going down lately so we're looking for another opportunity for people to
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:10.320]  bet on the US dollar going up there's an ETF called UUP it follows the US
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:15.480]  dollar third to some minor amount because people shouldn't be speculating some
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:19.720]  percent of your portfolio 10 20 percent you can use it just basically bet on
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:25.560]  stocks going down you can buy an inverse ETF like SH goes the opposite of the
[03:02:25.560 --> 03:02:29.400]  S&P 500 so stocks go down remember what I said earlier stocks go down at least
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:33.680]  twice as fast as they go up even in a bubble then you make some money on a
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:36.640]  small amount of portfolio and if you really sophisticated you can set up
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:41.080]  options or futures and things where you risk a little amount of money and it's
[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:45.160]  what some people call asymmetric returns as I said earlier stocks have been
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:49.360]  going up with so little volatility you can buy some of these futures and
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:53.920]  options sort of things with a little money very cheaply and only put a little
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:58.120]  money at risk but again you should do that as an entire strategy and sit down
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:00.960]  with somebody who knows what they're doing you shouldn't just run off this
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:04.240]  show and say oh I'm gonna go buy an off that'd be absurd but bottom line if you
[03:03:04.240 --> 03:03:09.680]  can accrue cash and liquid assets yeah when the depression hits you can then at
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:14.240]  the bottom of the depression buy real estate buy companies buy valuable things
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:17.720]  and be really successful on the other end in fact that's how a lot of the
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:21.120]  biggest fortunes have been made yeah Joseph Kennedy was a great example in
[03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:25.080]  the early 30s and here's the point out you have to have cash or something
[03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:28.560]  producing cash flow nobody's gonna lend you money when the world looks like it's
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:32.880]  going down the tube so it's the people have cash and liquid assets that can
[03:03:32.880 --> 03:03:36.800]  walk in to situations that are failing and literally say a business like buy
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:40.800]  your competitor out at 10 cents on the dollar or 20 cents on the dollar buy
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:45.240]  stocks at the bottom of the great depression stocks blue chip stock we're
[03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:51.520]  down 89% imagine buying great long-term companies that rate so that's the real I
[03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:55.960]  like the cash thing because you sleep at night you're not taking any risk you
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:04:00.440]  wait for things to fall apart sure what about the bail in though more and more
[03:04:00.440 --> 03:04:03.680]  they're trying to launch this thing and now in Greece they're talking about
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:07.280]  federalizing pension funds to quote protect them how do you keep them from
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:11.720]  pirating your cash in the future yeah well don't have it sitting in a normal
[03:04:11.720 --> 03:04:15.160]  commercial bank account or deposit account you have your money even if it's
[03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:20.160]  in safe cash like investments or money markets or CDs or whatever you have it
[03:04:20.160 --> 03:04:23.960]  in an investment account under your name that's not something that bank can
[03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:28.920]  lend against it's not like something like in Cyprus or Greece where banks or
[03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:33.480]  governments can come in and say oh we're just gonna take 10% of all deposits of
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:37.320]  people over really good advice I don't have a lot of assets but to back up this
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:40.080]  company in operation I have some reserves that are exactly what you're
[03:04:40.080 --> 03:04:43.320]  saying and that's when you buy is when markets are down you don't buy when
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:47.080]  they're up but but folks don't listen to that for whatever reason mr. Dent thank
[03:04:47.080 --> 03:04:49.960]  you so much look forward to speaking to you again in the future okay thank you
[03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:53.480]  Alex yeah his predictions are coming true ladies and gentlemen congratulations
