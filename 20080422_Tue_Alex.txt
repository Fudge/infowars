[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:16.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:16.000 --> 00:24.000]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this is a massive radio show today. Huge breaking news. Huge
[00:24.000 --> 00:35.000]  massive developments in the 10 minutes before I went on air. Huge developments on two different
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  major fronts. Well, there's actually three developments. I got a death threat last night
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  that I'm not going to detail because I don't like to help people terrorize my family. And
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  then at the same time, someone went into the Wikipedia file and said that I had committed
[00:51.000 --> 01:00.000]  suicide yesterday coinciding with the death threat. And I was basically told I need to
[01:00.000 --> 01:11.000]  shut up about this case of Raid Hamed, the local Palestinian activist, the American citizen,
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  the schoolteacher, who the evidence shows was murdered. And then they claimed suicide and
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  then was bound and gagged. And last night, I started realizing that it probably is a murder
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  because of the threats and other things that were happening. Then I learned this morning
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  about the Wikipedia entry that wasn't done as a joke. You know, it was implied, kind of with a
[01:32.000 --> 01:39.000]  criminology type or psychological mindset of, you know, Alex Jones went into his bathroom
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  and was threatening to kill himself. His wife called the police. When he learned that she'd
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  killed himself, he did kill himself, which shows a kind of copper government mind because
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  that's really how people a lot of times commit suicide is they're threatening it. I've seen a
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  lot of cases like that in the news and then someone calls the police and it escalates so
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  they commit suicide. And we're going to track, we're trying to track back exactly who did
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  that. We know who basically posted the identity, but we're trying to ferret in and drill in
[02:05.000 --> 02:14.000]  and find out who that person is. Now, I got in this morning and I got a call by pretty
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  much the leader of the Islamic community, well, not pretty much in Austin, Texas. I'm going
[02:19.000 --> 02:29.000]  to leave it at that. The individual who washed Hamid's body in Islamic customs, also Jewish
[02:29.000 --> 02:37.000]  customs. Jesus was washed, as you know. Ladies and gentlemen, he was tortured. No wonder
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  we're getting death threats over this. People do not want it to come out that they murdered
[02:41.000 --> 02:49.000]  this guy. This is a serious who done it. And yesterday it broke here on the air with a
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.000]  treasurer of his organization, the last person he talked to via telephone. According to
[02:55.000 --> 03:03.000]  phone records, he told me that what appeared to be Israelis with machine guns have been
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  talking to the neighbors. Mr. Hamid had talked to his neighbors. They said that it was
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  foreigners with machine guns asking if they could go in their backyard, that they'd been
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  surveilling him. He had seen them. Oh man, this is just horrible. And of course, Israel
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  has said in the Associated Press and in UPI, six years ago they will kill US citizens on
[03:24.000 --> 03:33.000]  US territory if they aid Palestinians in any way. People asked me to report on this stuff,
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  and I do, because it's important. And here we are, tip of the spear, as usual. Ladies
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  and gentlemen, I know why God put me in this position throughout my life, but certainly
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  everything's intensifying and my heckles have been up. My cackles have been up on the back
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  of my neck since yesterday afternoon with my sixth sense telling me, uh, danger, Will
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  Robinson, danger, danger. As I sit right here in Austin, Texas, where they threw this guy
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.000]  in the lake, this poor man. So that's coming up in 30 minutes. The other big news is so
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  massive, is so stunning, is so off the charts, is so transparent that when I read this 15
[04:16.000 --> 04:30.000]  minutes ago, I staggered. I'll tell you about it when we get back. This is a separate subject.
[04:30.000 --> 04:41.000]  This is just unbelievable. When we get back, it's just the next four hours, ladies and
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  gentlemen, are going to be a very important transmission, one of the most important we
[04:45.000 --> 04:54.000]  have ever done. Call everybody you know, tell them to tune in right now. This is massive.
[04:54.000 --> 05:02.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[05:02.000 --> 05:09.000]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[05:14.000 --> 05:23.000]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  that drives the entire new world order agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress toward
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  money they need. They're after power. That's their after easy. Order in game on DVD at

[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update. GCN has just discovered
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs. It's called proto-grow
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants
[06:06.000 --> 06:10.000]  to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions. Now here's the best
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance. Proto-grow's unique blend of sea nutrients
[06:14.000 --> 06:19.000]  maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  in minimum time. Proto-grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.000]  actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants. Proto-grow's full spectrum
[06:27.000 --> 06:30.000]  plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  the nutritional value. And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheat
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  grass, you can. If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  easy. GCN listeners who want to grow dirt sheep superfoods should visit the proto-grow
[06:42.000 --> 06:52.000]  website at GrowLikeCrazy.com. That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  In fact, rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  world health is staggering. We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  each day. The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  in which we live is unable to remove all toxins. The solution. Detoxification integrated with

[07:53.000 --> 08:07.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[08:07.000 --> 08:16.000]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:16.000 --> 08:32.000]  Ultra-massive news breaking in T-minus 22 minutes in the suspicious death of Mr.
[08:32.000 --> 08:39.000]  Hamed here in Austin, Texas, the U.S. citizen, Palestinian activist, peaceful, nonviolent
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.000]  activist part of the peace group, bound, thrown in the river, very suspicious behavior by
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  the police, first believing it was murder, then suddenly changing their story and
[08:49.000 --> 08:57.000]  saying suicide. We have been contacted by the head of the Austin Islamic Center, the
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  doctor that runs it, who I see on television all the time, who washed his body as
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.000]  Islamic custom. And I talked to him this morning five minutes before airtime, just as
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  I was digesting the massive news and he said clearly signs of torture abuse, which
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  is the same thing we got leaked from people at two different TV stations who are
[09:20.000 --> 09:27.000]  afraid by the way to go public. They heard the scanners. I mean, I'm wishing it was
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  suicide. I'm wishing the government wasn't so evil. I'm so tired of it. I'm wishing I
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  didn't have to risk my life doing this, but I'm too far into it. To ever back off,
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  it's pointed no return. It's like I'm a ship going across the ocean and I'm 75%
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  there. If I turn back, there's no way I'm making it back and I wouldn't turn back
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  if I could. Okay, here's the big news. Paul Watson, I made him aware of it about
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  15 minutes ago. He is on it doing a detailed analysis for prisonplanet.com that
[09:57.000 --> 10:03.000]  will go up in T minus two hours. This is the highest level priority for
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  info warriors if you choose to take this mission. And I'm not joking when I say
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  that. We have to cram this down the throat of every Neocon website, every
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.000]  Neocon radio show. We have to pump it into all of the New World Order Defense
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  Complex media outlets, ABC Fox, all their message boards, MSNBC, Target
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  Saturation, hit them everywhere. I need near instant recording of the
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  information I'm about to bring out and then YouTube uploads with detailed
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  documents over my statements. I do not have the staff to coordinate this. I'm
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  calling on you with your skills out there to do this so we can have a full
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  combined effort on the enemy force with what they've launched. This follows
[10:49.000 --> 10:57.000]  exactly as we predicted in articles last week that it would. This is hidden in
[10:57.000 --> 11:03.000]  plain view what you are about to hear, ladies and gentlemen. This is
[11:03.000 --> 11:10.000]  Associated Press. This was released two hours ago. I learned of it about 25
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  minutes ago. Al Qaeda number two. Brace yourselves. Al Qaeda number two says
[11:17.000 --> 11:27.000]  9-11 theory propagated by Iran. Steve Watson last week for M4Wars.net. He
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  does have a degree in political science, a very intelligent man, made the point
[11:32.000 --> 11:39.000]  that Iran was putting out statements and bringing out the fact that many of the
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  Iranian radicals, including those that took hostages, were funded by the CIA to
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  do it, and were given arms and weapons to hold the hostages in a staged event.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  It's like they used the same Islamist to overthrow Mohammed Mosaddegh in
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  1953. Then they put the Shah in. When they got tired of him, they brought in
[11:56.000 --> 12:03.000]  Islamic radicals. It's all staged at the highest levels. Many top
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  political scientists, by the way, believe that, and BBC reporter Greg
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  Pallas and many others. This is how Cloak and Dagger works. And Ahmed Denizide
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  showed himself to be an operative when he came out and said that world
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  government was a good thing when he came out and said 9-11 happened four years
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  ago last week, and Steve said, look at how Al Qaeda and the Shiite-led Iran
[12:28.000 --> 12:35.000]  constantly make statements that help the globalist. Now remember, last week
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu came out and publicly stated that 9-11 was
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  good for Israel. Well, yeah, we got the neocon documents where they said we
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  need massive terror attacks in the U.S. or we can't get our agenda through.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  We have neocon pundits writing articles for the Philadelphia News saying 9-11
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  was wonderful. We need another one. We have three years ago, before they
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  admitted all this, internal Republican memos saying they need another
[13:00.000 --> 13:07.000]  attack and fast, Gary Hart on the Democratic side of the CFR is calling
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  for the same thing, wrote a threatening letter to Iran to the rest of the
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  Imams who are not controlled, many of them. There's only one camp that is
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  from the evidence we've got inside Iranian system saying we will stage
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  attacks and blame it on Iran. Don't think it's because 80% of Americans
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  don't want to attack you, that the elements that control the U.S. won't
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  stage events. And then he listed Tonkin, he listed the main, he listed a
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  bunch of other events and said we provocateur. But let me get to the main
[13:35.000 --> 13:42.000]  issue at hand. Remember Colin Powell on the eve of the war was testifying
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  before the U.N. and Congress and in Congress five hours before it came
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  out, he testified that Al Jazeera had just aired a new bin Laden tape where
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  he said that he worked with Saddam Hussein. Now why would bin Laden come
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  out and even if it was bin Laden, they would just produce these audio
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  tapes out of nowhere and the media always just says it's real and then
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  you track it, it's uploaded to neocon or CIA, run websites like Intel
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  Center admittedly and Wired Magazine and others have had computer specialists
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  look at the bugs on the video, you know, the scroll on the bottom and the
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  Intel Center logo is uploaded at the same time in the same video layer as
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  the so-called Al Qaeda bugs and the Islamic Screed. They have Adam
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  Gadan, the grandson of the ADL head in English saying he works for Al Qaeda
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  and is going to attack us. I mean how dumb do we have to be? How in our
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  face does it have to get? How ridiculous? Right when they need to hear
[14:42.000 --> 14:52.000]  that Al Qaeda, a radical Saudi Arabian Wahhabist sect supposedly works, a
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  radical sub-sect of the Wahhabist sect supposedly worked with the secular
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  CIA installed Saddam Hussein who they then backstabbed. Totally ridiculous,
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  admitted to be a fraud now, but on the eve of the war, Colin Powell goes
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  before Congress, we wrote articles about it on prisonplanet.com and infowars.net
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  at the time in 2003 on the eve of the war and said, even bin Laden admits he
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  works with Saddam and the media all ran out of the chamber and came back in
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  and the congressman said, Mr. Powell, Secretary Powell, there's no such
[15:25.000 --> 15:32.000]  tape on Al Jazeera, they gotten their time zone off, they're sloppy. They
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  got their time zone, he said well it will be soon then. Every time they want,
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  I mean just every time they want to attack Somalia, the neocons do, Al Qaeda
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  comes out and says we work with Somalia. Every time, I mean Bush is in
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  trouble, the neoconogen is in trouble, bin Laden or Al Zawari releases a new
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  tape, a new audio tape, they release scores of videotapes that later comes
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  out are re-edits of 1999, 2000, 2001 videos. Remember the national, three
[16:05.000 --> 16:11.000]  years ago they aired all over the US, the two lead hijackers, supposedly
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  Edda bin Laden training camp and showed bin Laden and then showed the crowd
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  and showed closeups of their faces and I instantly said those look like CG,
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  Pixar does a better job of that, it looks like Disney and then it came out,
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  we broke it infowars.net, just linking to the mainstream news, that that had
[16:28.000 --> 16:36.000]  been used in a 2002 British documentary and on the screen, but they blew it
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  up when our media put it out, it said computer simulation, they cut their
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  heads on to men in the crowd, zoomed in on them, put it out on TV saying it
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.000]  was fake, it was a simulation of them being there, which has its own
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  propaganda effect, people don't notice at the bottom it said simulation, but
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  then by the time it hits our news they just blow it up a little, zoom in on
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  the video and cut off that it was a computer rendering. They put computer
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.000]  renderings on TV and say it's real and take it from TV shows where they admit
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  it's fake thinking we're so dumb or that we don't have the media power to
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.000]  expose it. Now I'm giving you background ladies and gentlemen, it goes on and
[17:20.000 --> 17:28.000]  on and on and on, this guy Al Qaeda's deputy leader Al Zawari is out of
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  Egypt where they run all the fake Islamic groups, they use the stage terror
[17:32.000 --> 17:39.000]  as a way to keep the corrupt government in power, that's been admitted.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  Their president, Hosni Nubarak who's been in there what 30 something years,
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.000]  just just just constantly uses stage terror as a way to crack down the
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.000]  stage elections to arrest people, admitted giant torture chambers,
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  totally paid off by the globalist and they've got this guy who's been an
[17:55.000 --> 18:02.000]  operative since he was 18 years old. Al Qaeda's number two says 9-11 theory
[18:02.000 --> 18:07.000]  propagated by Iran, so now when you say 9-11's an inside job, the media's so
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.000]  desperate with Jesse Ventura coming out and German former ministry of
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  defense coming out and Willie Nelson and the best actress, Oscar winner this
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  year and engineers and scientists and physicists, that now the drumbeat as
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  the talking point's been for six months, if you talk about 9-11 truth you
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  work for Al Qaeda, if you talk about 9-11 truth you're siding with the
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  terrorist, it should be illegal, you should be arrested, you should be
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  tortured, you should be sent to secret camps, that talking point was said on
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  MSNBC, Fox CNN all unified in the same week, government talking point,
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.000]  see the attack pattern, it's 100% guaranteed, we have them wide open,
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  they carried out the attacks, they're running the propaganda offensive.
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  Now the number two in Al Qaeda who always says what they need, who always
[18:56.000 --> 19:01.000]  puts out a press release agreeing with the wine house, he comes out and says,
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  now remember, another bin Laden whether it was real or not said that he
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  didn't carry out the attacks and it was staged, that got ignored, then they
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.000]  give you a fat guy in a video saying he did it and then they do voice print,
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  it's not the same guy, not even the same dialect, not even the same nose,
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  they blurred the video, dark room, major universities, US, Canada, England,
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  France, all analyze it, voice print, it's false, linguistics it's false,
[19:26.000 --> 19:34.000]  speech patterns false, video false, uploaded in the same format with the
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  government bugs on it, in the same video layers, hundreds of other points.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  We'll tell you what this means when we get back on the other side, we're
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  coming in, we're coming in hot, this is just unbelievable.
[19:47.000 --> 19:54.000]  Number two, Al Qaeda's number two says 9-11-3 propagated by Iran.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods you are not
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.000]  correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the
[20:06.000 --> 20:07.000]  treatment?
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  entire system are totally unnecessary?
[20:14.000 --> 20:20.000]  But now it's cancer's turn to die with lace med inks, patented methodology.
[20:20.000 --> 20:25.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  our physician's office.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  Laser technology at its best.

[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  Call 702-953-0267.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of
[21:16.000 --> 21:22.000]  exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.000]  blown wide open.
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.000]  Most people have no idea.
[21:35.000 --> 21:36.000]  They're not after money.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  They have all the money they need.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  They're after power.

[23:40.000 --> 23:43.000]  America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  We're in a no holds bar information war.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  Truth is our weapon, and prisenplanet.com has the tools you need
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've analyzed what they're doing.
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  There is no doubt this is a 100% proof positive.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  This piece of propaganda only adds more evidence to the fact
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  that they have totally staged the 9-11 attacks, everything.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  Al-Qaeda number two says 9-11 theory propagated by Iran,
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  AP, a summit in Laden's chief deputy on Tuesday
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  denied a theory that Israel carried out the September 11 attacks
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  and blamed Iran as a Shiite Hezbollah for spreading the idea
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  to discredit the Sunni al-Qaeda strike against the U.S.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  Now, notice they state it as if it's a fact
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  in all these propaganda pieces.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  It's always the same when it's a fake video or fake audio.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  Then later they admit this.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  The comments in a recording posted on Islamic website reflected
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  they won't even give you the Islamic website because
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  used to they would, and we'd go find it was in Houston or D.C.,
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  Virginia, and then you'd find out it was a neocon ADL front.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  We've got dozens of articles we wrote on that.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  You can go read them from 3, 4, 5, 6 years ago, 7 years ago.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  Unbelievable.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  The comments in the recording posted on Islamic website reflected
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  an increasing criticism by al-Qaeda's number two leader.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  The comments in a recording posted on Islamic website reflected
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  an increasing criticism by al-Qaeda's number two leader,
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  Al-Zawari, against Iran.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  He has accused Iran in recent messages of seeking to extend
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  its power in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  and through its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  Now listen to this. Here's the key. Later in the article,
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  the authenticity of the two-hour audio recording could not be
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  independently confirmed.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  Oh, why doesn't the headline say unconfirmed audio?
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  Remember how some kids did a video of chopping somebody's head off
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  in San Francisco in the news for two days reported it as real?
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  Because you see the media, the operatives at the AP,
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  who are operatives at this high level, they just, you know,
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  they don't talk to the guys that put out the fake vids.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  They just know it's an operation. They're supposed to put it out.
[26:06.000 --> 26:13.000]  So they got basically false started on that with another fake video.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  Unbelievable.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  The authenticity of the two-hour audio recording could not be
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  independently confirmed, but the voice sounded like past audio
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  tapes from the terror leader and the posting where it was found
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  for the logo Al-Sinab al-Qaeda's official media arm,
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  which they've caught the intel center in the same video layer
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  when they do videos, you understand?
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  It's a fact because they can tell the pixelation.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  You can blow it up. We can do it here at our office,
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  and we're not degree experts in it.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  You can see blowing up video if something was laid down
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  in the original feed of the video or it was laid over later.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  Sticks out like a store thumb in the pixelation layers.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  You can look at what format the video is in.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  The computer tells you that you know the shape of the pixels,
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  what type of compression.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  We deal with video here, but it doesn't matter.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  The experts have looked at these.
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.000]  This is mainstream news. It's fake.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  There's so many other facets to this.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  An audio tape that they don't say they can prove is real,
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  just like all the fat bin Laden tapes, the rest of it.
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  Now, remember, the FBI, local news, national news,
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  have all reported the FBI for six and almost seven years
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  coming up on the seventh anniversary, hearing about four months,
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  will not say that he carried out 9-11 and will not indict him for it.
[27:40.000 --> 27:48.000]  He is not indicted. He is not listed nothing for the attacks.
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  He is listed for the coal. Why is that?
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  Now, remember, the BBC and others reported three months before 9-11
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.000]  in Pakistan, a British ambassador went to see bin Laden
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  in front of the press with the CIA and U.S. military guarding him.
[28:07.000 --> 28:14.000]  Then he went to Dubai for kidney work, and the report is died shortly after 9-11.
[28:14.000 --> 28:20.000]  Bandar Bush, that's his nickname, the former Saudi ambassador to the U.S.,
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  best buddies with the Bushes, that's why it's called Bandar Bush.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  On Larry King one night, Larry King called him a coward and said he was bad
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  and said, don't talk about him that way. Don't say bad things about bin Laden.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  You can see over there, the family gets all the contracts,
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  building contracts, they run everything for Mecca, you name it.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  They then get to be big heroes over there and Bandar said,
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  you don't talk bad about him. Knowing that would be on Saudi TV.
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  Very sophisticated double game, triple game.
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  So we need an article exposing the fact that bin Laden
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.000]  is on the FBI Most Wanted list every time they need him to.
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.000]  Al-Zawari comes out and says, I mean, it's been over a hundred times.
[29:01.000 --> 29:06.000]  I can't even remember them all, where he comes out and always agrees
[29:06.000 --> 29:11.000]  and says Al-Qaeda is doing quite well. Al-Qaeda launched this attack.
[29:11.000 --> 29:17.000]  Al-Qaeda is working with Iran. Al-Qaeda is fighting Iran to confuse the public.
[29:17.000 --> 29:23.000]  I'm going to cover more of this, but huge breaking news
[29:23.000 --> 29:31.000]  in the mysterious death of Ra'id Hamid, Ra'id Hamid,
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  bound, hand and foot, mouth, eyes thrown into the river.
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  They claim it's suicide.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  We'll be right back with a very special guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  Lock yourselves in. This is huge.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:48.000 --> 29:52.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:55.000 --> 29:59.000]  I'm Harold Williams. I know about martial law.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  I want to teach you how to survive it.
[30:01.000 --> 30:04.000]  America has ten telling signs of martial law,
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.000]  so use the short time left to learn to protect your family
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  with the vital information in this book.
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.000]  Find the book at survivemartiallaw.com.
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.000]  I will tell you what you need to know to prepare for martial law.
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000]  Things are changing fast. We even email you a free weekly update.
[30:21.000 --> 30:24.000]  I teach you how to act around troops, where to put supplies,
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  how to be safe during the worst part of martial law,
[30:27.000 --> 30:28.000]  which is in the beginning.
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  Surviving this major life transition can be difficult, but possible.
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  Arm yourself with the knowledge as this is the only weapon
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  you will have to protect your family.
[30:37.000 --> 30:43.000]  Go to survivemartiallaw.com or call 866-644-1933.
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  Act today as there will be no warning.

[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  Find the book at survivemartiallaw.com.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  Protect your family.
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.000]  Wake up, Protestant America.
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.000]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  will form one huge political voting block.
[31:05.000 --> 31:09.000]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state,
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  must be kept separate.
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.000]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[31:23.000 --> 31:25.000]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome,
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  religious intolerance resulted.
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[31:37.000 --> 31:40.000]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.

[33:17.000 --> 33:20.000]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:20.000 --> 33:26.000]  We had the treasurer of Raid Hamed,
[33:26.000 --> 33:32.000]  Raid Hamid's Palestinian aid organization, Peaceful Peace Group
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  that tried to bring school books and medicine to the Palestinians.
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  He had told the treasurer of his organization that there had been what appeared to be
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  and the neighbors told him Israelis with machine guns around his house,
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  questioning them.
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.000]  UPI reported that Israel said it will kill U.S. citizens that aid Palestinians in the U.S.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  That was a public government statement.
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  Hamid, of course, disappeared last Tuesday.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  He was found a few days later in the Colorado River,
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  known as Lady Bird Lake, here in Austin, Texas.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  We put out the call for witnesses, for family.
[34:11.000 --> 34:17.000]  The family is scared. The school teacher is at the school where he was a loved keyboard teacher,
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.000]  which taught computer and typing.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  Believe he's been killed.
[34:24.000 --> 34:35.000]  Well, guess what? We have Dr. Ibrahim Dramali, who is the director.
[34:35.000 --> 34:41.000]  He is the director of the Islamic Center of Greater Austin.
[34:41.000 --> 34:48.000]  That is the large, main Islamic organization here in Austin, Texas.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  This is the main organization, thousands and thousands of members.
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.000]  They have Islamic school, a lot of other things.
[34:57.000 --> 35:09.000]  They are the spokesman who you hear on local news when there is a religious issue, or whenever there's a religious holiday that is Islamic.
[35:09.000 --> 35:17.000]  He washed, as is Islamic custom, it's also the old Jewish custom, like with Jesus, washed the body of Mr. Hamid,
[35:17.000 --> 35:24.000]  who was found bound, arms, legs, mouth, eyes in the river.
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  I talked to people at two different TV stations who said that it looked like he had marks on him.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  It looked like he was in agony, that, quote, been tortured.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  People, of course, were scared to speak out on the show.
[35:33.000 --> 35:40.000]  We said that we had this info. Well, here is the man who did the Islamic washing of him.
[35:40.000 --> 35:52.000]  He is the head of the Islamic Center of Greater Austin, the major Islamic cultural and religious and schooling organization in this major metropolitan city of a million people.
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.000]  He is going to give you the breaking news, and I guarantee you they've tried to tell the media this.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  We're going to find out why the media didn't report on it.
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  The police, APD, first said they believed he'd been murdered.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  They then changed it overnight and said he committed suicide.
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.000]  Well, they said we think he's committed suicide because, and then they tried to cover up what happened with an autopsy.
[36:11.000 --> 36:12.000]  We're not sure.
[36:12.000 --> 36:19.000]  So we go to Ibrahim Ramali, the head of the Islamic Center for Greater Austin.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  Thank you for coming on the show, sir.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  Thank you for calling us. Thank you for emailing us.
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  We were talking to him from the Islamic Center.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  We, of course, double-checked. He is the director there.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  We are talking to him from the center.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  We'll probably try to have him in studio in the next few days because we're here in Austin.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  Sir, you've got the floor.
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.000]  Please slowly tell us exactly how he came in, what you saw, what happened.
[36:43.000 --> 36:49.000]  First, Mr. Johnson, good morning, and thank you very much for supporting this issue.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  What's made me interested to speak with you, actually, you are against the war,
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  and we are as a Muslim community here.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  We are against the war every place.
[36:57.000 --> 37:03.000]  And what I saw about Mr. Riyadh, his name, Riyadh, by the way, not right.
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  Well, you know us, Texas, we can't pronounce things correctly, but go ahead.
[37:06.000 --> 37:07.000]  Riyadh.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  Mr. Riyadh, they brought him here and they asked me to watch him.
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.000]  And normally, this is our Islamic tradition, we have to watch the recede.
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  And I entered the room where I was supposed to watch him.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  He was covered in the plastic bag.
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  The moment I, you know, opened the plastic bag, it was a disaster.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  What I saw, no one can see.
[37:29.000 --> 37:34.000]  The people, actually, the people with me, they are panicked.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  They cannot even help. They cannot do anything.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  And they have experienced with this before.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  But they, he was cut from the right shoulder all the way to the stomach,
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  and from the left shoulder all the way to the stomach again,
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  and from the stomach all the way to the bladder.
[37:51.000 --> 37:59.000]  And it was, and lift open, and all his flesh and meat and blood come out.
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  And not only that, in the stomach, actually, there is a big plastic bag,
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  all the stuff inside, you know, in the bottom of the plastic bag.
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.000]  The other thing, his head, from all the back of his skull is completely cut,
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  and empty, completely, empty.
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  And of course, to watch him, it's very hard to watch something like this.
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  His arms, his wrist, it was also open and cut,
[38:24.000 --> 38:31.000]  without not even one stitches to cover, to just a sewing or to cover his cuts.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  And it was really a disaster.
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  What I saw, his eyes actually dropped all the way down,
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  because there's nothing supporting the eyes inside.
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  Of course, when I watched him, it is, I didn't know what to say.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  I cannot even sleep since Friday when I watched him.
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.000]  I cannot even sleep, believe me, I was in panic, and I cannot even function.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  Please continue.
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  Now to be clear, I'm sorry about getting the name wrong.
[38:58.000 --> 39:04.000]  I was calling it Riyadh, and then people corrected me on the pronunciation,
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  but I'm getting your name pronounced correctly, sir, right?
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  Yes, Mr. Johns.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  Yes.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  Well, listen, I know this is very upsetting to you, doctor,
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  the head of the Islamic Center for Greater Austin.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  I was told this by two different people at TV stations
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  who heard the first police feeds over the scanners,
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  but people are scared to go public.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  You're now the eyewitness who washed him,
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  and I know this is very hard for you to talk about.
[39:36.000 --> 39:42.000]  What is it like for you to know that the media and the police are covering this up?
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  That's what's making me really sad.
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  Making me really sad.
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  This man, he is really very honorable, very good man,
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  and I heard about him from some other places.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  I heard about him from friends.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  I heard about him from students.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  He taught some students here we have.
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  And when I heard about him, and then I watched him on Google,
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  and it was really, he's a good man.
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  He tried to help the children, nothing else but children.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  He's a person against the war.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  He's not with the war.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  He's not supporting any terrorist organization.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  I saw his family.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  For the first time I met his family, I met his kids.
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.000]  It's so sad to lose their father like this.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  And I saw his son, when he was his son crying,
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  I put myself in that place.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  I am also a peace activist.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  And I say, you know what?
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  I am next.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  I was given speech, you know, in my prayer, in a Friday prayer.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  I was giving them lecture.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  And I said to the people, this is a disaster.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  And if we keep quiet to something like this, we are next.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  We are absolutely next.
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  And anybody, I worry about you, Mr. Johns.
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  You know, you always fight for against the war, against the war.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  And everybody against the war now.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  He's written to be killed just like this.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  I was death-threaded last night.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  I don't really like talking about it because it upsets my wife.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  It only makes me commit more.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  It makes her commit more, but it's very upsetting to her.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  We have small children.
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  At the same time, they went on my Wikipedia file
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  and said that I'd committed suicide last night.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  Uh-oh.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  That is the sign.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  That's what they say.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  They accuse him that he's, you know, by the way, for your information,
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  Islamically, it's prohibited to kill yourself.
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  We, as Muslims, we're looking for a paradise.
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  And when we kill ourselves, in Quran, it says,
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  whoever killed himself, he will have an eternal life in Hellfire.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  So there is no way for any Muslim to think about killing himself.
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  You know, I really don't believe that at all.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  You know, someone, he has a four-month degree.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  He's pursuing for his PhD.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  Why someone working for a PhD is to go and kill himself?
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.000]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  It is, it's really disaster.
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  I believe me.
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  I believe me.
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  I'm afraid myself.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  Well, that's the whole point.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  That's the whole point of this murder.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  And then their arrogant cover-up, like,
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  we're so stupid, we won't see through it.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  Now, I want to go back.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  Who brought you the body?
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  How many days after he had been taken,
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  or was it the same day after he had been taken out of the water?
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  Uh, they'll try to spin it and claim they'd done an autopsy.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  Had they done an autopsy?
[42:16.000 --> 42:21.000]  I mean, please tell us about the chain of custody of Mr. Riyad's body.
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.000]  Uh, Mr. Jones, the autopsy is not like this.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  I am in the field of science, too.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  And when you take an autopsy for somebody,
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  at least you, you, you cover it back.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  You take some certain area.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  I understand.
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  You sew them back up.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  You don't bash the brain in.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  You know, cut the body open and all those places.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  I understand.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  And what's the record?
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  Uh, what day he was taken out of the water?
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  What day you got him?
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  We got him Friday, 11 o'clock a.m.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  Friday.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  And I think I heard that he was taken from the water on Saturday,
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  but we got him in the mosque here in the Islamic Center.
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.000]  We talked him on Friday.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  And I received him 11 o'clock.
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  Okay, so to be clear, you got him less than 24 hours later,
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  and they had not done an autopsy?
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  No, he was, you know, no, actually, I took him after that autopsy.
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.000]  of the autopsy.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  I took him here and I watched him after the autopsy.
[43:14.000 --> 43:19.920]  Okay, great, but these cuts and the bastion head were not indicative of an autopsy, because
[43:19.920 --> 43:21.800]  they'll try to spin this.
[43:21.800 --> 43:24.640]  Describe specifically, sir, what you saw.
[43:24.640 --> 43:33.000]  I saw a cut, they cut him from the right shoulder to the stomach exactly, and the left shoulder
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.400]  to the stomach, from the stomach all the way to the bladder, and his head, the skull is
[43:38.400 --> 43:45.400]  completely open, and his left arm, also from the wrist, all the way to the top to the half
[43:45.400 --> 43:51.080]  of his arm, it was open, and big, big cuts, you know, just like cutting the whole body
[43:51.080 --> 43:52.080]  in reality.
[43:52.080 --> 43:55.120]  Okay, did it look surgical, or was it left?
[43:55.120 --> 43:56.120]  No, it doesn't.
[43:56.120 --> 43:59.240]  Okay, so it was jagged wounds?
[43:59.240 --> 44:00.240]  What is that, I'm sorry?
[44:00.240 --> 44:02.760]  Were the cuts in straight lines, or were they jagged?
[44:02.760 --> 44:05.680]  No, no, it is a straight line.
[44:05.680 --> 44:11.120]  It is a straight line exactly, but it is not normal cut, like, I have a surgery, I have
[44:11.120 --> 44:13.520]  a kidney surgery, and I can tell the difference.
[44:13.520 --> 44:14.520]  No, no, I understand.
[44:14.520 --> 44:21.440]  I understand, I mean, did you call him and say, say, well, I mean, be specific, this
[44:21.440 --> 44:25.880]  was not then from the autopsy, what else did you see on his body?
[44:25.880 --> 44:34.760]  I saw his hand, it is very dark, just like, very dark, like, I mean, very black.
[44:34.760 --> 44:44.280]  I saw his head, part of his head is not like a, part shaved, and part is not shaved.
[44:44.280 --> 44:53.200]  I saw in the body also, his bruises in the face, I saw also, yeah.
[44:53.200 --> 44:58.040]  And there are other witnesses to this, but you said they were so, it was so horrible
[44:58.040 --> 45:00.040]  that they panicked and ran out of the room?
[45:00.040 --> 45:03.440]  Yeah, believe me, they cannot wash him with me, I have to bring some other people to
[45:03.440 --> 45:08.920]  help me to wash him, because the blood coming out and blood, and we have to stop the blood,
[45:08.920 --> 45:16.480]  and we have no other choice just to have a, like, iron tape and seal those cuts, and it's
[45:16.480 --> 45:21.800]  very, very, very, very, very hard for us to do this, it's unbelievable, I never saw something
[45:21.800 --> 45:23.480]  like this in my life, be honest with you.
[45:23.480 --> 45:26.560]  And you said his eyes were coming out of his head?
[45:26.560 --> 45:34.800]  Yeah, his eyes dropped down, and I didn't open his eyes because it was like, some stick
[45:34.800 --> 45:37.800]  like a glue on it or something like this.
[45:37.800 --> 45:38.800]  Unbelievable.
[45:38.800 --> 45:39.800]  Yeah, it did.
[45:39.800 --> 45:40.800]  Now the media, the media.
[45:40.800 --> 45:47.120]  Until, since Friday, until today, I cannot even forget what I saw, it is something very,
[45:47.120 --> 45:51.360]  very, very hard, very hard.
[45:51.360 --> 45:55.120]  Now you say that his head was, was it cut open or bashed open?
[45:55.120 --> 46:01.360]  Oh, it's open, it's cut, although the skull cut was just like a sword, and empty everything,
[46:01.360 --> 46:06.120]  like no brain, no nothing inside, and the head, only the skull, a skull with that, with
[46:06.120 --> 46:08.960]  the hair, that's all what I saw.
[46:08.960 --> 46:12.400]  That sounds like a cover up, like they may have shot him in the head or something and
[46:12.400 --> 46:17.120]  taken the brain, this is, have you called the police and called for an investigation,
[46:17.120 --> 46:19.080]  what have they said to you?
[46:19.080 --> 46:25.040]  We are actually having a committee right now from the Islamic Center, and we're gonna,
[46:25.040 --> 46:27.960]  we're gonna just fight for this.
[46:27.960 --> 46:30.480]  We're not going to keep quiet as a Muslim community.
[46:30.480 --> 46:33.400]  We are doing the right, the committee right now, and this committee, we're gonna just
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.760]  call the police, call the FBI, call the hospital, who cut them like this, who just came like
[46:37.760 --> 46:38.760]  this.
[46:38.760 --> 46:43.600]  But this is not, it is against our religion 100% what we saw.
[46:43.600 --> 46:48.520]  We cannot do something like this to any, any person, it is a, it is a barbaric act.
[46:48.520 --> 46:50.560]  That's what I saw exactly, is a barbaric act.
[46:50.560 --> 46:55.320]  Okay, to be clear, doctor, you believe that, that this was done previous to the autopsy,
[46:55.320 --> 46:56.800]  you believe he was tortured?
[46:56.800 --> 47:03.520]  Uh, I really, I cannot, I didn't know that, but you never know.
[47:03.520 --> 47:05.520]  You never know.
[47:05.520 --> 47:08.920]  Well, I mean, they show you up when they do an autopsy.
[47:08.920 --> 47:09.920]  You're saying it was all laying over?
[47:09.920 --> 47:10.920]  It was not.
[47:10.920 --> 47:11.920]  He did it not.
[47:11.920 --> 47:13.800]  They left it open in a barbaric way.
[47:13.800 --> 47:19.000]  You know, honestly, honestly, just like somebody eating the body, it is a flush and, and, and
[47:19.000 --> 47:25.920]  the store, all the flush and the blood outside the skin, you know, it is really, uh, I wish
[47:25.920 --> 47:27.920]  I could, I can just like take a picture with that.
[47:27.920 --> 47:32.400]  But they always, I mean, I mean, there's even state, well, there's even state regulations
[47:32.400 --> 47:33.400]  on this.
[47:33.400 --> 47:37.440]  They're supposed to sew a body up after, even if they're going to cremate it, that this
[47:37.440 --> 47:43.080]  is, uh, so this is bizarre that, did you take any photos?
[47:43.080 --> 47:49.400]  Unfortunately, it's not, we're not allowed Islamically to do that in Islamically.
[47:49.400 --> 47:53.920]  We cannot take a photo and show it, but I, I really almost, I did that and just to show
[47:53.920 --> 47:58.080]  the proof and why they did something like this to someone of us.
[47:58.080 --> 48:04.120]  But, um, I, um, Islamically, we cannot do something like this.
[48:04.120 --> 48:08.200]  But you have the, uh, witnesses who brought his body to you?
[48:08.200 --> 48:12.920]  Uh, I, I, the, what, the, some agency, they carry him here straight.
[48:12.920 --> 48:16.440]  It's like funeral agency.
[48:16.440 --> 48:20.080]  And was it from the county medical examiner or the Austin coroner?
[48:20.080 --> 48:22.280]  I really didn't know which one of them.
[48:22.280 --> 48:26.080]  I can confirm that for you next week and I'll pick all the information and I can call you
[48:26.080 --> 48:28.120]  with that, Mr. Jones.
[48:28.120 --> 48:31.760]  What was it like for you after you saw what had happened to his body?
[48:31.760 --> 48:33.000]  I'm sorry?
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.840]  What was it like for you after you witnessed what, what his body looked like?
[48:36.840 --> 48:41.800]  Oh, you know, the witness, I never, the guy, well, he's another Imam in another mosque
[48:41.800 --> 48:43.640]  here in Austin.
[48:43.640 --> 48:50.360]  When, when, when we opened the body, he opened his eyes on his mouth and he was like a fraud.
[48:50.360 --> 48:57.720]  He cannot even, he was panic and, and then I looked at him, his, his face changed.
[48:57.720 --> 48:59.960]  And then I said, I didn't know what to do, Dr. Ramali.
[48:59.960 --> 49:02.240]  And I said, uh, don't worry, I will wash him.
[49:02.240 --> 49:04.000]  I was panicking myself.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.640]  And the other guy, he's an old fellow and, uh, and he said, I didn't know.
[49:08.640 --> 49:10.400]  I never saw something like this in my life.
[49:10.400 --> 49:11.560]  You know what it sounds like to me?
[49:11.560 --> 49:17.480]  It sounds like this is a message to you, uh, to not tell me to leave him all laid open
[49:17.480 --> 49:22.680]  and cut open with his, I guess his guts were all hanging out in the bag or believe me,
[49:22.680 --> 49:27.520]  Mr. Jones, I say that in my lecture on my ceremony, I say this is a message for all
[49:27.520 --> 49:33.040]  Muslims and whoever worked for against the war for peace activists, this is a message
[49:33.040 --> 49:34.040]  for all of us.
[49:34.040 --> 49:35.920]  Now, now you say he had bruises on his face.
[49:35.920 --> 49:38.200]  Did it look like he'd been beaten?
[49:38.200 --> 49:40.760]  Um, it looks some bruises.
[49:40.760 --> 49:46.560]  I don't know the beating or because of the water or, uh, some cloth and I really cannot
[49:46.560 --> 49:48.400]  tell, uh, because we are panicking.
[49:48.400 --> 49:49.400]  You know, you cannot get.
[49:49.400 --> 49:52.080]  What does the family think happened to him?
[49:52.080 --> 49:57.760]  Uh, unfortunately, the family is very afraid, all of them, no exception.
[49:57.760 --> 50:01.320]  I tried to speak with them and unfortunately, you know, they are really panicked.
[50:01.320 --> 50:02.960]  They are very afraid.
[50:02.960 --> 50:08.760]  You know, Mr. Jones, what, what's going on to the Muslims after September 11 is, is,
[50:08.760 --> 50:10.200]  is, is disaster.
[50:10.200 --> 50:15.800]  We are accused with anything we do, even kids playing with the water gun, their, their family
[50:15.800 --> 50:18.160]  arrested water gun, you know, the water gun.
[50:18.160 --> 50:22.520]  I took my kids to the Toys R Us and my son, he want to have a water gun.
[50:22.520 --> 50:24.520]  I said, no, we're not allowed to do that.
[50:24.520 --> 50:29.520]  I said, dad, we are American and I say, yes, we are American, but we are, we are special.
[50:29.520 --> 50:31.520]  So stay there.
[50:31.520 --> 50:33.240]  Doctor, stay there.
[50:33.240 --> 50:34.240]  We've got a break.
[50:34.240 --> 50:42.080]  I want to come back and talk to Ibrahim, Dr. Ibrahim, uh, Dromali, who is our guest today.

[54:04.080 --> 54:24.080]  Ibrahim Dramali is our guest, we're talking about Riyadh, Hamad, I mean they always show
[54:24.080 --> 54:29.960]  you up unless they're trying to cover up things, look like you had bruises on him, all sliced
[54:29.960 --> 54:33.040]  open, cut open in a bag with everything hanging out.
[54:33.040 --> 54:39.080]  This is just an incredibly insulting and abusive move whether it was from torture or an autopsy
[54:39.080 --> 54:43.600]  or what, this is a massive cover up sir.
[54:43.600 --> 54:46.600]  The police first said they believed he'd been murdered then they spun it and said that he'd
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.800]  killed himself, they claim they have a tape showing him walking down to the river but
[54:50.800 --> 54:56.080]  they won't release it, it doesn't show him supposedly jumping in, what do you think happened
[54:56.080 --> 54:57.080]  here?
[54:57.080 --> 55:05.040]  As I said, Mr. John, he's a Muslim and he knows very well he cannot kill himself.
[55:05.040 --> 55:09.720]  As with the Muslims we don't kill ourselves, we don't kill innocent, as God mentioned in
[55:09.720 --> 55:15.560]  the Quran said whoever killed himself he will have an eternal life and hellfire.
[55:15.560 --> 55:23.240]  Plus Mr. Riyadh, Mr. Hamad, he's a person for a PhD and he has kids and family and he
[55:23.240 --> 55:29.400]  has a mission in his life, it doesn't make sense to anybody regardless who is that person,
[55:29.400 --> 55:33.840]  Muslim, Christian or Jew that he will kill himself with this kind of things going on
[55:33.840 --> 55:36.840]  in his life.
[55:36.840 --> 55:43.880]  Overall, yesterday actually we have some friends, his friends came and visit me and
[55:43.880 --> 55:51.200]  just to thank me because what I did and I asked him, I said he was a religious person
[55:51.200 --> 55:56.360]  and he said he's a Muslim, he's a regular Muslim and he knows very well killing himself
[55:56.360 --> 56:00.360]  it is a prohibitive.
[56:00.360 --> 56:05.320]  Yeah I've seen a lot of these murder suicides where the authorities claim that you committed
[56:05.320 --> 56:09.240]  suicide and it's always the same MO, they don't quote the family member, they don't
[56:09.240 --> 56:17.000]  quote the friend, they just vaguely say yeah he'd been upset and then they kill you and
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.120]  make it look like that you killed yourself but in this case Gary Webb exposed CIA drug
[56:22.120 --> 56:25.680]  dealing, they shot him twice in the head and the police said oh it's normal to shoot yourself
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.560]  twice in the head, that's a quote, they said they see it all the time which there is no
[56:29.560 --> 56:36.320]  known case of it, I actually looked it up in criminology, in some of the criminology lexicons
[56:36.320 --> 56:41.840]  and encyclopedias that are online and there's no known real cases of it, there's cases people
[56:41.840 --> 56:47.520]  shooting themselves multiple times in the chest who are crazy but the power of blowing
[56:47.520 --> 56:51.960]  his own jaw off then shooting himself in the head and we saw a cop of the year who exposed
[56:51.960 --> 56:55.520]  the government bombing Oklahoma city, they tortured him to death, shot him twice in the
[56:55.520 --> 56:58.680]  back of the head, claimed it was suicide.
[56:58.680 --> 57:03.640]  Why do you think they would go so far as to then send you the body all sliced up when
[57:03.640 --> 57:08.400]  that's not by law, the coroner has a procedure, they're supposed to sew him back up even if
[57:08.400 --> 57:11.720]  this was just the coroner?
[57:11.720 --> 57:15.880]  You know something else, I think by the law also they have to take permission from the
[57:15.880 --> 57:16.880]  family to do that.
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.520]  That's right, you have to get permission, they have to have permission from the most
[57:21.520 --> 57:24.600]  because there's a religious issue he was talking about.
[57:24.600 --> 57:29.000]  Let me stop you, this is absolutely key, you have to get permission from the family for
[57:29.000 --> 57:35.200]  an autopsy generally and this was in less than 24 hours, the point is that they would
[57:35.200 --> 57:37.000]  always sew him back up.
[57:37.000 --> 57:42.640]  Yeah, he was not, he was not like that, open and believe it or not, it's not like a normal
[57:42.640 --> 57:48.640]  cut, it is absolutely not a normal cut and it is straight, yes, but if you look at it
[57:48.640 --> 57:55.280]  as a flush and the meat comes out of the body, you know, it's something just like things
[57:55.280 --> 58:00.880]  you see in an animal channel, discovery in the jungle, that's what I saw, something in
[58:00.880 --> 58:05.200]  the jungle, somebody, an animal attacking another animal or animal attacking a human
[58:05.200 --> 58:06.560]  being or something like that.
[58:06.560 --> 58:11.960]  So he was just ripped to shreds, absolutely as Mr. John.

[58:44.560 --> 58:48.800]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[58:48.800 --> 58:53.320]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:53.320 --> 58:59.360]  It's known as the Builder Bird, put their objective being world domination.
[58:59.360 --> 59:04.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[59:04.760 --> 59:12.880]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[59:28.000 --> 59:30.200]  they're after power, that's their affidavit.

[59:46.840 --> 59:58.400]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:58.400 --> 59:59.400]  Government cover-ups.
[59:59.400 --> 1:00:00.400]  You want answers?
[1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:01.400]  Well, so does he.

[1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:16.600]  There is so much global news, there are so many things I want to cover, just massive
[1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:20.760]  transmission lined up for you today.
[1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:28.000]  So, the Costillo raided, being set up, former DEA agent, were going on a showtime documentary.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.120]  David made fun of him and said he shouldn't have done the documentary about government
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:32.120]  drug dealing.
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:36.520]  He'll be in studio with us in an hour and a half, into the fourth hour today.
[1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:40.320]  Right now, for this segment, part of the next, and I've got all this other huge news, we
[1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:44.240]  are joined by Dr. Ibrahim Dromali.
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:49.600]  He is the head of the Islamic Center for Greater Austin, the largest Islamic organization here
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:51.560]  in Austin.
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:01:00.280]  He washed the body of Riyadh Hamid, who was bound, gagged, thrown on the river.
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:03.120]  Police first reported over scanners, they believed he'd been murdered.
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:05.880]  For a day they said that, then they put out a release that, well, they thought he bound
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:13.880]  himself and killed himself, and it looks like he was tortured, looks like he was, that's
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:17.560]  what I got from people that were at TV stations, was that, yeah, it looked like he was in great
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:23.240]  pain, like that he was cut, that he had been hurt.
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:26.440]  People can try to rationalize that and say, oh, well, he was bumping into rocks and things
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:27.440]  in the river.
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:31.400]  It's a very slow-moving, dirt-bottomed river over there.
[1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:36.200]  It's not like it moves about a mile an hour or less, I mean, in a day, he only moved what
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:37.560]  500 yards they were saying.
[1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:40.880]  Give me an idea of this lazy river, because it's a dam, it's Colorado River.
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:44.160]  It's dammed up for the city.
[1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:49.240]  Now they get the body, and the coroner supposedly had it, and everything sliced, bashed open,
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:55.960]  brain's gone, huge slices everywhere.
[1:01:55.960 --> 1:02:00.280]  Were these slices into muscle, like saying it starts on an arm, did it just gouge into
[1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:01.280]  the muscle?
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:04.200]  I hate to get detailed here, sir, but you watched the body, you saw it.
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:08.280]  I mean, were these just, because it was a coroner, it would just be a slice into the
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:12.120]  skin, opening the skin up to see the innards, or was it gouged in?
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:15.200]  I mean, describe that for me, doctor.
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:22.640]  Actually, the one, especially in the middle, they put all instance and whatever inside
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:28.440]  the stomach in a plastic bag, and they put the plastic bag inside the body, inside the
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:29.940]  stomach again.
[1:02:29.940 --> 1:02:35.640]  And the one from the shoulder, you know, where the whole muscle comes out of the body, completely
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:37.320]  out of the body.
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:44.000]  And it looks like, I don't know if you have your spotter, some kind of goat or animal,
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:50.320]  and exactly the same way, when you watch some kind of animal, you kill an animal or something,
[1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:51.320]  exactly the same.
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:52.320]  I mean, it's...
[1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:56.920]  You're saying, you're saying it looked like he'd been stabbed through the top of the shoulder
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:02:57.920]  down into the heart?
[1:02:57.920 --> 1:02:58.920]  It looks like...
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:05.880]  Yeah, for those that don't know, with a large blade, what you do is you stab somebody right
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:12.360]  below the collar bone on the front, in that opening, right above the collar bone, just
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:13.840]  straight down into the heart.
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:16.000]  Is that what you're saying, doctor?
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.160]  From the shoulder all the way to the stomach, in the middle of the stomach, exactly, where
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:21.960]  is the stomach between the two, the line?
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:24.560]  You're saying an internal puncture?
[1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:25.560]  Yes.
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:26.560]  Oh my God.
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:27.560]  Yes.
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:37.880]  And all the way, and just like, you know, the simple, the simple, exactly the same way.
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:47.520]  And only one rope in the middle, catching all those skins together, and everything
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:48.520]  open.
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:53.680]  His head, you know, Mr. John, really, really, if you saw it, I don't know that his head
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:04:00.240]  was cut because it was laying down on his back, and I felt something cracked mid-sound.
[1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:06.280]  And when I looked, I tried to move his head, part of his head, half of his head completely
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:07.280]  in my hand.
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:08.280]  That's all.
[1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:09.280]  My God.
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:10.280]  It is a disaster.
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:17.200]  I really start to cry, and I look at that, I didn't know the person before, and when
[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:23.040]  I read the newspaper in the morning, before I know that he's coming to the mall for walking,
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:29.080]  I read about him, I googled him, and I said, oh my God, look at that, and it's, it's, it's
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:30.960]  anybody to work for peace.
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:33.880]  It'll be, I said to the people, my people, my people.
[1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:34.880]  Okay, stay there.
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:35.880]  Final segment, sir.
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:36.880]  We've got a break real fast.
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:39.920]  We'll be right back with you, Doctor.
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:46.840]  Unbelievable, and now they've got L CIA to out saying that 9-Eleven Truth works for Iran.
[1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:50.840]  The CIA is working overtime.

[1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:00.240]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize-winner Linus Pauling, because fruits and vegetables
[1:06:00.240 --> 1:06:04.400]  in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than have heated.
[1:06:04.400 --> 1:06:08.840]  The champion juicer is the best way to get your nutrients or body craves.
[1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:13.320]  The champion juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.

[1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:27.680]  but also is shown to reverse once-thought incurable life-threatening diseases.
[1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:32.600]  Juicing with the champion juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.

[1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:54.360]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[1:06:54.360 --> 1:06:58.360]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[1:06:58.360 --> 1:06:59.360]  the water?
[1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:03.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:04.160]  into the skin.
[1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:08.840]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to

[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:58.520]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:06.440]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:12.840]  Full segment with the head of the Islamic Center for Greater Austin, Dr. Ibrahim Dromali.
[1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:20.240]  I was asking him during the break, if he tried to talk to the media, he says they have a
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:23.680]  committee together, they're going to put out a press release, but that they've been
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:27.800]  contacted by TV stations and hadn't talked to them yet, just because he said he told
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:31.720]  me during the break, because they've been not telling the truth.
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:36.760]  What is the truth, in summation, any other key points, doctor, and why you didn't talk
[1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:39.520]  to them, other media, but you talked to us?
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:47.160]  Mr. Jones, unfortunately, as Muslims, we have a very bad experience with the media, especially
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:49.000]  me myself personally.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.920]  A lot of people attack me sometimes, and the media never say the truth.
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:59.080]  One newspaper, only one newspaper and one radio station in Iowa say the truth.
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:03.520]  They fight for, again, the world, just like you, and he is the only one, and the reason
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:07.440]  he was attacked from everyone in Iowa.
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:13.760]  So I don't want to speak with them, there are some TV stations that try to protect me,
[1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:14.760]  unfortunately.
[1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:18.480]  I don't want to speak with them because they are never say the truth, and I don't trust
[1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:19.480]  them at all.
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:25.040]  While I was listening to your show, I believe you really work for peace, and you won't really
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:29.400]  compete in this country, so that's why I would have the courage to speak with you.
[1:09:29.400 --> 1:09:33.960]  Well, we do appreciate your courage, and I hadn't talked to you before.
[1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:36.200]  I didn't know that you saw this the same way.
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:42.040]  His body all cut up like that, which violates state regulations and law.
[1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:45.600]  His body all cut up, and you said that you believe-
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:50.480]  Mr. Jones, I was in two states before attacks.
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:55.640]  I was in Florida before, I was in Iowa before, and before anything happened like this, something
[1:09:55.640 --> 1:10:03.280]  happened like this, somebody got killed, somebody accident, they almost got attacked and-
[1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:04.280]  Hello?
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:05.280]  Hello?
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:08.560]  Yes, sir, I'm here, continue.
[1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:11.600]  We just have a little cut out in our line to you.
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:13.080]  Go ahead, please continue.
[1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:18.240]  Yeah, normally the agency, the hospitals, the police, they contacted the Islamic center
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:20.240]  before they do anything.
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:24.760]  They contacted the Islamic center before, even contacted his family first, and to see what
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:26.960]  is the procedure to do.
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:32.440]  But I found out, unfortunately, the only place here in Austin, they just did whatever they
[1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:37.600]  want without taking permission from the family, or for us as a religious leader in the area.
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:41.960]  They're supposed to contact, you know, very well, he's a Muslim, and he's supposed, you
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:48.320]  know, to support at least, what is the procedure, what to do, to respect that's all, to respect
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:49.320]  the human being.
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:54.840]  Well, I hope that they don't take me, torture me, tie me up, throw me in the river, and
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:11:00.120]  then the local coroner cut my body all up, or maybe it was cut up before, not sew me
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:04.480]  up and give me back, you know, liquefied with my guts hanging out in the bag.
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:10.040]  I mean, this is just hateful and vicious, and a vicious message to everyone, kind of
[1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:12.800]  like Luca Brazzi sleeps with the fishes.
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:18.600]  You know, Mr. Jones, we, as a Muslim community here in Austin, we are panicked.
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:24.240]  We are afraid that people, every place I go now, if people come to the mosque and speaking
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:28.160]  with me and say, Dr. Bermari, we have to do something, I say, yes, we do.
[1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:36.040]  We have to do something, that's why, but everybody in just like shock situation, honestly, it
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:39.880]  is not easy for us, Mr. Jones, you know, something like this.
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:46.760]  Sir, you've certainly heard that his partner, who's the treasurer of his charity for children,
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:51.880]  who he talked to last, has said that Israelis with machine guns had been around his house,
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:56.520]  his neighbors told him that, men with foreign accents with machine guns, who they believe
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:00.880]  were Israeli, and then Israel has said they will kill U.S. citizens inside the U.S., were
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:01.880]  you aware of that?
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:08.240]  No, but I don't, it's not a strange, I didn't hear it yet, but it's not strange to me,
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:14.960]  you know, there is a personal writing about Muslims, his name is Joe Kaufman, this man,
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:20.960]  every single Muslim, working for the Islam, especially for Palestine, especially supporting
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:28.720]  the Palestinians, this man writing about them, believe me, our government, they know very
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:36.320]  well this man is dangerous for America, dangerous for America, and they do nothing to him, absolutely
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:42.920]  nothing to him, believe me, the FBI director in Iowa came to me once and he said, no, this
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:48.320]  man, this man is crazy, so what you didn't do, anything for the crazy person, he is
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:55.880]  absolutely against America, and he is absolutely free, no one can touch him, and his name's
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:13:04.600]  Joe Kaufman, he has a right to American against hate, and in reality, American for hate, why
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  this man is free?
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:12.120]  This man actually supporting, wrote about Riyadh, an article about Riyadh, and about
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:16.720]  Riyadh's organization, he wrote an article, I googled it this morning, and I was shocked
[1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:21.640]  when he said about Riyadh, like supporting Hamad, supporting terrorism, supporting business,
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:22.640]  supporting that.
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:28.200]  Oh, he said that, he said that Mr. Hamad was supporting terrorists when there's no evidence
[1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:29.200]  of that?
[1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:37.560]  Yes, yes, I always say that, you can check his site, and if you google Hamad and Daniel
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:43.280]  Bipe, I wrote about him, because Daniel Bipe and Joe Kaufman is in the same page, in the
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:49.920]  same page, we really as an American, we must wake up for some people like this, we must
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:54.320]  really take an action with something like this, we really have to understand who is
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:14:01.400]  right and who is wrong, unfortunately, after September 11, unfortunately, we condemn that,
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:02.400]  it is against the...
[1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:05.400]  Well, it was a staged event, sir.
[1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:10.400]  Yeah, and it's an important, it's still attacking Muslims until today, even if you are against
[1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:15.600]  it, even if you condemn, even if it's against Islam, it's still the people attacking us.
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:22.240]  You know, Mr. John, we are Americans, we are Americans, just like everybody else, and we
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:24.680]  must have our rights as an American.
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:25.680]  I understand.
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:31.360]  Doctor, I want to talk to you more in the days to come, as this develops, Ibrahim Damali,
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:38.720]  Doctor Ibrahim Damali, the head of the Islamic Center of Greater Austin, austinmosque.org,
[1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:41.240]  is the website, thank you for coming on with us.
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:43.840]  Thank you, thank you very much, sir.
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:44.840]  And be careful, okay?
[1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:45.840]  Thank you.
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:47.920]  Thank you very much, yes, I will.
[1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:49.920]  Thank you, bye-bye.
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:56.360]  Incredible, ladies and gentlemen, and you know, last night, I don't want to get into
[1:14:56.360 --> 1:15:04.080]  the details, I got a very vicious death threat, and then I got up this morning, and Paul Watson
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:07.800]  said, if you've seen this, it was a link to Wikipedia, and it wasn't the normal, I'm
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:13.840]  a drug addict, or I'm a criminal, vandalization of my Wikipedia page.
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:19.880]  It was someone trying to put something out that sounded plausible, which just happens
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:20.880]  in a lot of cases.
[1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:27.520]  Nobody who knew criminology, knew psychology, because I've seen a lot in cases of the same
[1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:31.400]  thing where these crises escalate in the real world.
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:36.640]  It said, in fact, I printed it this morning, it's somewhere in my stack, it said, Alex
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:40.920]  Jones, we're going to write an article about it, was, you know, fighting with his wife
[1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:46.940]  last night, and he went in the bathroom and had a gun, and was threatening to kill himself.
[1:15:46.940 --> 1:15:50.840]  His wife called the police when she did, he escalated it and shot himself in the head,
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:56.680]  he's dead, and it was written to sound official, Alex Jones dead, we're going to find out
[1:15:56.680 --> 1:16:02.520]  who did it, because that's a terroristic, that's a crime, you can track back who's identity
[1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:09.480]  did it, they have to register with Wikipedia, and I think I might just litigate that, because
[1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:14.560]  that's terroristic, probably lead back to a neocon website or something, you know, that
[1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:20.080]  uploads the Al Qaeda videos in the same video format, with the same video overlay as the
[1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:26.480]  Al Qaeda graphics, that's admitted, mainstream news, they make these.
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:32.080]  It's so sick, the neocons bragged that 9-11 helped them, the British bragged, the Israelis
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:36.480]  bragged, helped their police state, it helped launch the wars, they said Saddam was behind
[1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:42.040]  the attacks, they admit that's not true, every time they need somebody to come out and say
[1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:48.480]  something, number two Al Qaeda says it, here's the article on prisonplanet.com, I'm asking
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:53.440]  everybody to get this out to everyone today, because they are now, they've already been
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:58.560]  saying for six months, now this is the official announcement, 9-11 truth works for Al Qaeda,
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:03.440]  now they're saying we work for Iran, and that we're terrorist, and they have provocateurs
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:09.280]  showing up at ground zero, with signs saying 9-11 truth was behind the bombing of the recruitment
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:16.720]  center, I mean they're pulling all sorts of stunts, they've had the police show up and
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:20.240]  people that were security guards that worked for Silverstein and calling fake bomb threats
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:27.080]  on Luke Radowski, I mean folks, we're on the front lines for you, and all we're asking
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:32.400]  you to do is to realize that the enemy's coming after us with major propaganda offenses
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:37.120]  after 9-11 truth, because a lot of big wigs are going public, a lot of heavy hitters are
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:41.760]  going public, if we take the sponsored terror away from the new world order, state sponsored
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:46.760]  terror, globalist false flag terror, that's one of their main ace in the holes, they're
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:49.880]  going to have to just play a king of hearts or something on us, they need that ace of
[1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:56.920]  spades, because we got ace cards too, we got top cards as well, called the truth, and called
[1:17:56.920 --> 1:18:02.760]  the people and history and God, so they are desperate, they want to now say we're terrorists,
[1:18:02.760 --> 1:18:07.880]  didn't matter how stupid it is, they said Saddam, their CIA creation was Al Qaeda, the
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:12.000]  public is mindless, not all of them now, they don't trust them as much as they did, this
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:15.680]  is life and death folks, I think they're trying to discredit 9-11 truth now because they're
[1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:20.000]  getting ready to stage something, this is red level, I said to my office last night,
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:26.880]  I said I've never felt this much concern, I've never been this frosty, I don't know,
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:32.400]  we may be able to stop them launching something if we get the word out now, Al Qaeda, Al Cia
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:39.600]  Aida's sock puppet, Zahari, claims I ran behind 9-11 conspiracy theories, intelligence
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:45.360]  stooge unleashes another PR stunt on behalf of neocons, but Paul, I know you're, we might
[1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:49.640]  want to make the point that AP admits, but later in the article, that they can't even
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:53.200]  prove it's real, it's all, they don't even, they do audio set a video now because they
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:59.080]  get caught putting, you know, making the video themselves, through voice print, through video
[1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:04.960]  analysis, through the graphics they lay on, in the same layer as the CIA run, the three
[1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:10.160]  guys that run it are all former CIA, of course current, defense and towel guys, and it's
[1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:17.040]  just so sick, you want to investigate 9-11 folks, here's some places we ought to be looking,
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:22.360]  that's all I can tell you right there, Al Cia Aida's sock puppet, Zahari claims I ran
[1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:27.360]  behind 9-11 conspiracy theories, AP says the authenticity of the two hour audio recording
[1:19:27.360 --> 1:19:31.440]  couldn't be, it couldn't be independently verified, oh, they won't even say what website
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:34.960]  it came from, because we always track it back to the government, we're going to read the
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:41.880]  story by Paul Watson, I need you to get this out massively, go completely insane with this,
[1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:51.160]  your whole email list, every news site, we need to get this out now, this is an emergency.

[1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:40.920]  All right, reading Paul Watson's article which I need to put out of the four wins ASAP. LCIA
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:47.920]  to sock puppet Al Zahari claims I ran behind 9-11 conspiracy theories. Intelligence dude,
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:56.440]  unleashes another PR stunt on behalf of neocons. LCIA to sock puppet Al Zahari has quoted in
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:02.200]  a alleged audio tape released today accusing Iran of being behind 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:07.120]  Another crude public relations stunt designed to generate hostile opinion towards the 9-11
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:12.240]  truth movement because it's threatening to collapse them. That's why you got liberals
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:15.240]  and others trying to co-op the movement into socialism and the rest of it right now. They're
[1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:20.160]  gonna fail too. It's decentralized. You can't centralize it. You can't get control of it.
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:23.720]  You can't stop it. They want to centralize 9-11 truth so they can decapitate it. That's
[1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:25.220]  an inside op.
[1:25:25.220 --> 1:25:30.040]  The tape had been promised three weeks ago by a monitoring group Intel Center. They're
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:33.400]  the ones that upload fake videos. We have a link to that. Who have been caught in the
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:41.280]  past putting out fake and misleading al kind of material via the alleged media arm of the
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:52.640]  terrorist organization and was finally released today. The setup revolved around Al Zahari's
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:58.440]  responding to questions submitted by the public via the internet. But they won't say the website.
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:02.680]  The Intel Center just magically the ones caught uploading fake videos. Admittedly fake, but
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:05.680]  they always magically have it on.
[1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:10.200]  One of the questioners asked about the theory that was circulated in the Middle East and
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:14.720]  elsewhere that Israel was behind the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in Pentagon
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:19.680]  reports the Associated Press. I'm gonna stop right there. This is about two things. Saying
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:27.160]  9-11 truth is al Qaeda or slash Shiite Iranian and that this all came from Iran, you're anti-American
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:33.000]  if you say it, but it's also about making Israel behind it. The media for almost seven
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.560]  years since it happened. Always if you question the official story said you're talking about
[1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:43.920]  Israel and Israel only and try to tie it to anti-Semitism. Now previously it was a minority
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:49.240]  that believed Israel was involved. Now I'd say a larger minority believes Israel and
[1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:54.480]  Israel only when Israel couldn't have acted alone. I have no doubt that elements of Israel
[1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:59.120]  weren't involved in it. It just says British were involved. Same thing with the one, they're
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:04.960]  all together. That gives none of them a free ride. It means they're all involved, all equally.
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:13.680]  Because this is a massive government operation. So, oh, it's just amazing. So now they also
[1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:19.160]  want to make it about that, to make it the big taboo of anti-Semitism, to shut down
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:27.000]  and to chill effect big Hollywood stars, governors, politicians, scientists, German Defense Minister
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:34.400]  as Italian presidents. This is a panic. Notice they're the ones that always say that. They're
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:38.560]  not afraid of people thinking Israel did it. They could care less. Benjamin Netanyahu comes
[1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:43.560]  out and says, boy, this sure helped us wanting it to be about that. Their own documents say
[1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:47.920]  they want Israel to be attacked. That makes their people in psychology get even more under
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:53.760]  their control. This is very sophisticated. You've got to play chess instead of checkers,
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:58.240]  folks. Oh, it doesn't matter. You've got it all figured out, some of you, don't you?
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:02.840]  One of the questioners asked about the theory that the, you just go to some random website
[1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:08.040]  and Zikari supposedly answers your questions. I mean, come on. One of the questioners asked
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:10.720]  about the theory that was circulated in the Middle East and elsewhere that Israel was
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:14.640]  buying the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in Pentagon, reports the Associated
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:20.880]  Press. Al Zahari accused Hezbollah's Al Manor television of starting the rumor. Oh,
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:23.640]  really? They just started talking about it a few years ago and I've been saying it before
[1:28:23.640 --> 1:28:28.480]  the attack. It's me. It came from me, government, and you know it. The purpose of the lie is
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:35.480]  clear to suggest that there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can't hurt America as
[1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:42.200]  no else did the history. Iranian media snapped up this lie and repeated it, he said. So now
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:47.440]  it's the Iranians. As anyone with even a superficial knowledge of the 9-11 truth movement can attest
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:53.720]  to, the sock puppet, Zahari's claims that Iran was the first to question the official
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:59.000]  9-11 story is completely ludicrous. We wrote a story about that last week. We saw the scripting
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:05.120]  last week. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadidjid, a recent bumbling comments about 9-11, the
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:09.520]  date of which he cannot even accurately remember, was music to the ears of neocons who seized
[1:29:09.520 --> 1:29:14.760]  upon statements as fodder to debunk the 9-11 truth movement. Zahari's single sentence
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:20.920]  retort and the fact that it has been used to generate headlines that link alternative
[1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:25.600]  theories about 9-11 with those evil Iranians is a clear smear of it. That's all they can
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:30.480]  ever do is tie you to terrorists. Oh, you think the government's terrorist. You're a terrorist.
[1:29:30.480 --> 1:29:36.520]  You're with them. Oh, you caught cops for mockaturing. You must be a terrorist. You've been caught.
[1:29:36.520 --> 1:29:45.080]  The people know it's too late for you. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex

[1:31:56.320 --> 1:32:00.160]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their
[1:32:00.160 --> 1:32:05.280]  own vehicles? Very few consumers even know such products exist. SFR has obtained this
[1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:09.400]  technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run yet they
[1:32:09.400 --> 1:32:14.040]  don't want you to know about them. This product is made right here in the United States and
[1:32:14.040 --> 1:32:19.960]  is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store. SFR last up to six months. SFR
[1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:25.600]  works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars. SFR recently ran this ad and
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:29.720]  the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners

[1:32:55.760 --> 1:33:02.760]  There's going to be a massive news blitz from about 45 after right through to the bottom
[1:33:02.760 --> 1:33:09.360]  of the next hour when former DEA agent, big contributor in the new Showtime Special American
[1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:17.160]  Drug War, when he joins us bottom of the next hour in about an hour, he'll be with us into
[1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:25.760]  the new fourth hour we're doing. There is just so much. I'm going to finish up with
[1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:31.560]  Al Qaeda number two, so 9-11 theory that it's an inside job propagated by Iran and it's
[1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:36.040]  just some audio tape on a website that the Intel Center caught bringing out fake videos
[1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:41.320]  as put out. It's just these people never end. I mean, they have the grandson of the
[1:33:41.320 --> 1:33:45.760]  head of the ADL, Adam Gadan, out claiming he's American Al Qaeda and videos in English
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:52.000]  to us. Let me see if Watson put Adam Gadan in this article. I'm just now reading it
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:57.640]  because he wrote this in response to my ranting first hour. I just can't handle it anymore.
[1:33:57.640 --> 1:34:04.480]  It's so obvious. We're going to cover that. In California, certain elitists are allowed
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:09.160]  to not obey the laws. That's now mainstream news. I've got news stacked up here that is
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:13.720]  all so insane. I didn't even cover yesterday's insane news because we're so busy covering
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:20.320]  everything else that's going on. But you know what? In amongst all of this, we couldn't
[1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:25.360]  bring you this show without our sponsors. I want you to know that. The sponsorship of
[1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:31.760]  this show is prisonplanet.tv memberships. 15 cents a day. You get all 18 of my films,

[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:10.720]  also makes this broadcast possible. So please also think about signing up for that. Think
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:15.440]  about getting American drug war the last wide hope that I consulted on and I'm in that's
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:19.840]  showing on showtime. We have it. It's not even in stores till the 24th of next month.
[1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:24.420]  We have it now, only place discounted out of the gates, American drug war, three hours
[1:35:24.420 --> 1:35:29.840]  of extras, two hour film. We have washed and you're fired by William Lewis, the new America
[1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:34.280]  freedom to fascism. I'd call it part two of that unbelievably good. Washing your fired
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:43.800]  in full wars.com. But another sponsor who makes this show possible is World War two
[1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:50.680]  chemical core officer Marty Schachter, 60 plus years running the family on business.
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:57.600]  He started with his father in 1947. He runs it now with his son and his son and they were
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:01.760]  organic soap before anybody knew what that was from the old days when they got rid of
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:05.880]  it. And he was a specialist in chemicals. So he knew how deadly it was, the ingredients
[1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:11.360]  on soap. So him and his dad got together and had an original soap company made out of vegetable
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:19.480]  and fruit oils and it's 85% off supermarket prices. And so we believe in having great
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:24.440]  sponsors that actually save you money. My wife loves this stuff. The whole office loves
[1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:30.520]  it. Call and get the tote bag, the sampler bag shipped to you. It's massively discounted
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:34.680]  basically it costs you to get you to try it to find out or get a free brochure, get a
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:41.600]  free color catalog from them or call get a six month your supply, save 85% off what the
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:46.360]  oil companies. That's right. The oil companies basically own the detergent soap companies.
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:52.200]  It's not really soap. It eats your clothes, gives you rashes, very toxic. Most asmos caused
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:56.680]  by it. Major studies on that. It's toxic waste. It's what's left over from the oil
[1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:00.680]  refineries mainly and I have family that works in them folks. I knew that when I was a little
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:04.360]  kid, they separated all out and I'm going to shut up and bring Marty up. Marty folks
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:09.200]  need to give you a call. Good morning, Alex. Good to hear from you. Good to have you here,
[1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:14.320]  my friend. Look, look, I have you up once a month. I fiercely believe in your product.
[1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:18.280]  A lot of my listeners have checked you out. You usually read a letter from them. You get
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:23.400]  them every day. This, this is just, this is the type of soap you leave under your arms.
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:27.640]  It doesn't burn you, but it cleans you because it's not a chemical weapon. Will you explain
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:32.040]  that to people? Well, in making soap, you want it to be what
[1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:38.000]  they call neutral, a pH of neutral, which is seven. When you get higher than that, you
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.440]  get into alkali. It starts burning or you get below seven into five or four or three.
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:50.840]  It becomes acidic and also burns. We try to keep the products like the shampoo and the
[1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:58.640]  dish soap as neutral, as harm free as possible. And you know, we, let's get down to, let's
[1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:05.520]  get down to earth. Today is earth day and we want products to be made for the earth.
[1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:14.120]  Earth friendly soap. That's what we make. And I know that most people are tired of supporting
[1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:22.320]  those multi-billion chemical companies like proctor Colgate believer. They give you destruction,
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:27.680]  not only of the earth, but of your clothing, skin and wallet. And meanwhile, they're behind
[1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:32.440]  the phony environmental movement with a carbon tax on humans instead of giving people real
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:37.080]  things that really are good for the earth. Exactly. That's what's happening out there.
[1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:43.360]  And we want people to have a choice, freedom of choice, choices that of these harmful detergents,
[1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:49.120]  choice of pure soap for their baby, for their shaving, for their all purpose cleaning, for
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:54.640]  their baby, for their home, for everything that touches. This is the kind of products
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:39:02.960]  we specialize in. We promote, we market and we appreciate going to all the Alex Jones
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:09.880]  listeners and sharing the good life with them. Well, you really do save 85% off. I would
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:14.960]  imagine it's more now with all the oil costs going up for the petrochemicals. People wash
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:19.480]  their hair with and put on their babies and the rest of it. But everybody knows that with
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:23.440]  a baby, you've got to go out and get organic now or get the weaker stuff because it breaks
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:28.160]  them out and hurts them. It's doing the same thing to adults. Explain what's in your products
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:33.640]  versus what is in the big chemical company stuff. We basically make a product from coconut
[1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:42.040]  oil of the highest grade, vegetable oils of the USP grade. I mean, United States, pure.
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:49.920]  We blend it together. We don't use perfumes. We should talk sick. We use juices from fruits,
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:56.280]  juices from coconuts, juices from oranges, juices from lemon, juices from apples. This
[1:39:56.280 --> 1:40:03.120]  is what gives us the aroma, but it rinses freely, doesn't leave any residue on the towel, in
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:10.320]  the air or on your skin. And this to us is the future of cleansing. We're a very small
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:15.800]  company. We're not a big corporation. We're a family partnership, but we have the knowledge,
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:22.240]  the expertise, and the information to share with you in our free catalog or in our miniature
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:28.600]  tote bag for you to exclusively try something that will blow your mind. You'll never use
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:34.320]  anything like this. We're the only company in the country producing products of this
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:39.480]  quality, of this cost value. I'm only going to use these products. You're not only going
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.760]  to love these products, you're going to have something in your home that you're going to
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:46.880]  really, really love.
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:52.040]  Now Marty, until about five, six years ago, you were only a wholesaler to finer hospitals
[1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:56.560]  and hotels, and I've actually been in a nice hotel one time and seen some of your bars
[1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:01.600]  and stuff. And then you got convinced by the network, by the sales manager who was a fan
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:10.240]  of your products, because he was into organic stuff, to try marketing direct. That's why
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:14.200]  people get your stuff so inexpensive. You're cutting out the middleman. You're cutting
[1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:19.440]  out the tens of billions that the big chemical companies use and all their propaganda and
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:24.560]  advertising. This is just high quality stuff. Please give the listeners your phone number
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:25.560]  twice.
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:45.680]  Area code 510-638-7091 or 800-340-7091. That's your toll free number 800-340-7091.
[1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:55.840]  Number five-star soap, that's five, the number five, five-star soap.com, five-star soap.com.
[1:41:55.840 --> 1:42:00.520]  We have a big banner on jonesreport.com, a banner on infowars.com. You cannot miss the
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:07.160]  Calben Pure Soap. Calbenpuresoap.com or five-star soap.com. Go there, check it out. And it also
[1:42:07.160 --> 1:42:11.400]  hurts the New World Order. I mean, everything they do is a fraud. They take real soap away,
[1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:19.280]  take it a chemical byproduct that makes you sick, dries your skin out, hurts you. I mean,
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:23.960]  it's everything they do. You can go back to what they had before. I mean, just wait till
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:29.560]  you get one of these bar soaps and smell the almond and cherry essence that's in it. Give
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:42.960]  them the number again. 800-340-7091. That's four. 1-800-340-7091. We have three lines
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:48.240]  for you to get into us. If it's busy, please call back. We want to hear from you. If you've
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:54.680]  got any kind of cleaning problem, let us take care of it for you. We're here for you. We're
[1:42:54.680 --> 1:43:01.920]  here for Alex. We're here for quality, low-cost, and safety. Now, you're in Oakland, California
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:08.840]  where you've been since 1947. How late are you open? What would that be? Like 435 o'clock?
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:16.040]  Pacific? A line has opened 24 hours, 24-7. If we miss your call, we'll call you back.
[1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:22.760]  No problem. Call us any time. You could use the whip any time to get contact with us.
[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:27.880]  We actually await to hear from you. Well, changing our lifestyle, I know cell
[1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:32.760]  phones are bad for me, so I have cut back probably 95, 97%. I just use it to listen
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:36.660]  to messages now, and I've even kind of gotten out of that habit, so there's like 30 messages
[1:43:36.660 --> 1:43:40.400]  on there right now, but I know it gives you brain tumors, so I've almost completely stopped
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:44.840]  and so has my wife. It took a year or so to train myself to get off of it because I had
[1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:49.720]  habitualized it. We've totally gotten away from anything that is organic in the house
[1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:55.640]  now. 95% of the food we eat, every once in a while, we eat out maybe once a week, twice
[1:43:55.640 --> 1:44:02.360]  a month. I mean, sometimes we don't eat out even that much. We're cutting all the non-organic
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:07.640]  food out of our thing. I mean, it just takes making the decision, and you also take the
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:12.080]  money away from the New World Order. You know, stop taking the local paper that's filled
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:16.960]  with New World Order propaganda. You know, we change the way we live one step at a time,
[1:44:16.960 --> 1:44:21.560]  and you do that by, and by the way, we still go to Central Market and Whole Foods. The
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.080]  big quote, organic grocery store is here in town. We're about half of it's really organic
[1:44:25.080 --> 1:44:31.200]  at Central Market, and the organics are three, four, five times sometimes, five times, usually
[1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:39.080]  about twice what the toxic detergents are that they don't sell at Whole Foods. With
[1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:45.280]  Marty, it's different. It's 85% off organic, so you usually pay a premium for organic,
[1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:50.160]  not with Marty. That is, I think, a key selling point that you don't make, and that I don't
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:59.600]  make the point enough, Marty, is that you are less than the toxic stuff and a lot less
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:01.760]  than the main line organic. You see what I'm saying?
[1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:06.240]  Yes. Well, we eliminated the middleman. We eliminated the broker. We eliminated the
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:13.800]  distributor. We go directly by United Parcel at the lowest contract rate. All this adds
[1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:21.120]  up to savings for the consumer, savings for Alex Jones listeners. That's our goal.
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:24.720]  FiveStarSoap.com. Give me a limerick there, Marty.
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:31.960]  Yes, I have one, but this is by popular demand. I have to repeat this, plus it's new encore.
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:39.920]  It goes like this. There was an old man of man tuck it, who kept all his cash in a bucket,
[1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:46.600]  but his daughter, named Nan, ran away with a man, and asked for the bucket, Nan tuck
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:54.080]  it. Ha ha ha ha ha. Ha followed the pair for poor tuck it, the man and the girl and
[1:45:54.080 --> 1:46:00.800]  the bucket, and he said to the man, you're welcome to Nan, but as for the bucket, poor
[1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:07.000]  tuck it. Ha ha ha ha. Then the pair followed poor to Manhasset, where he still held the
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:14.480]  cash as an asset, and Nan and the man stole the money and ran, and as for the bucket,
[1:46:14.480 --> 1:46:19.280]  Vanhasset. Unbelievable. Marty Schachter, good to hear from you.
[1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:24.160]  Thank you, Alex. Talk to you soon. You bet, my friend. Just unbelievable. Marty
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:34.040]  is so funny. Okay, back to the really, really serious news here that I have in front of
[1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:38.760]  me. For those that don't know, I want to make this point again, and I think Paul needs
[1:46:38.760 --> 1:46:43.160]  to add this. I don't expect him to whip everything up, and he does cover some of it, but there's
[1:46:43.160 --> 1:46:47.520]  just so many points, so many frauds, so many lies. I don't know how he could cover it all.
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:52.000]  They are now putting out a talking point for six months that 9-11 Truth works for Al Qaeda.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:57.280]  Now they've had Al Qaeda and another fake tape released by the Intel Center come out,
[1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:00.760]  and I mean, they don't even, the AP admits in the bottom of the article that, oh, well,
[1:47:00.760 --> 1:47:06.120]  it's not been proven. We don't even know where it came from. I mean, I could talk in Arabic,
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:09.120]  you know, learn the lines and read it on to the web, and they'd come out and say it was
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:14.680]  true. I mean, how many ADL grandsons heads do we have to have threatening us with turbines
[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:22.000]  on their heads? I mean, I just can't handle it anymore. It's just so arrogant. It's so
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:33.600]  much bravada. And I read a bunch of this article earlier, but finishing it up with Al CIA to
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:40.160]  sock puppet Zahra here. He claims I ran behind 9-11 conspiracy theories. One of the questions
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:44.480]  asked about the theory was circulated the Middle East and elsewhere that Israel was
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:48.960]  behind the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon reports the Associated
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:53.280]  Press admitting they don't know if it's him. They never do. It's always the same thing.
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:48:00.640]  Al Zahari accused Hezbollah's Al Manor television of starting the rumor. No, I started exposing
[1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:03.960]  government-sponsored terror along with many others before the attacks took place, and
[1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:08.080]  I did on the day of the event and lost a bunch of my affiliates, but never wavered and never
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:14.320]  backed off. Okay, so it started here. If it started anywhere, it started here on the show.
[1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:18.640]  The purposes of this lie is clear to suggest that there are no heroes among the Sunnis who
[1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:24.560]  can hurt America. As no one else did in history, Iran media snapped up this lie and repeated
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:30.160]  it, he said. And again, that Saudi Arabian propaganda in league with the neocons attacking
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:35.360]  their enemy Iran. It's Israeli propaganda. Israel has been creating fake al-Qaeda groups,
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:41.680]  source Haraj Jerusalem Post. Let's add those links in there. As anyone with even a superficial
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:47.120]  knowledge of the 9-11 truth movement can attest to, the sock puppet Zahari's claim that I
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:52.080]  ran with the first to question the official 9-11 story is completely ludicrous. Iranian
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:57.040]  president Mahmoud Ahmad Enneji's recent bubbling con comments about 9-11, the date of which
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:02.280]  was three years off. He could not even accurately remember where music to the ears of neocons
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:07.120]  who seized upon statements as fodder to do about 9-11 truth movement. Zahari's single
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:13.440]  sentence retored at the fact that it has been used. And why do we even agreeing at Zahari,
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:17.920]  Paul? I mean, it's another fake tape. We know the guy's an operative, but we don't even
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:22.760]  know if this is him. Zahari's single sentence retored and the fact that it has been used
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:27.640]  to generate headlines that link alternative theories to 9-11 with those evil Iranians
[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:32.360]  as a clear smear effort is highly suspicious considering the history of these al-Qaeda types
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:39.680]  and Zahari's background. Is the neocon friendly al-Zahiri a different person to the real al-Zahiri
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:46.240]  who was reported to have been captured in Tehran in February of 2002? Is it a different
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:50.720]  Zahari, al-Zahiri, and he gets into it to the one reportedly captured in the Pakistan-Afghan
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:55.400]  border in September of 2004? We have links to all these reports. They never retract how
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:50:01.880]  they kill him or capture him. It's truly the Goldstein of 1984. Or is it the same al-Zahiri
[1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:07.760]  who at the end of the Egyptian Islamic jihad fought for the CIA in Bosnia? Is that the
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:12.440]  one, the real CIA operative, al-Zahiri? Is this the same al-Zahiri who according to the
[1:50:12.440 --> 1:50:16.960]  January 2000 U.S. Congressional testimony was granted U.S. residents by the immigration
[1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:22.000]  naturalization service, something almost impossible for many legitimate immigrants to obtain? Is
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:27.480]  this the same al-Zahiri whose brother Zameen is running terrorist camps under NATO protection
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:35.280]  in the U.S. zone in Kosovo? Oh, is this the same al-Zahiri who works with the grandson
[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:41.120]  of the ADL head, Adam the Godot? It is the same al-Zahiri. Previous tapes which feature
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:46.080]  a man al-Zahiri were found to be cobbled together from older footage, but that doesn't bother
[1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:51.040]  the lapdog media who versed in manufacturing consent and never offering retractions. Our
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:55.720]  beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:51:00.480]  worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in modern history,
[1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:04.760]  the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:08.600]  their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time
[1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:14.360]  frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv

[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:44.800]  show. Number one in the field of unlocking minds. So many people's minds we've unlocked.
[1:54:44.800 --> 1:54:49.760]  Locked again and get caught in little subgroups who say it's all the Catholics or it's all
[1:54:49.760 --> 1:54:55.560]  the Jews or it's all the Reptoids. They accuse me of not exposing the Pope as we write articles
[1:54:55.560 --> 1:55:00.160]  exposing how he's New World Order and then they post in our comments where we give them
[1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:05.440]  free speech that I'm covering up when I'm posting it. Or they say we don't expose Israel
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:11.760]  as I expose what's probably Israeli hit teams killing people in Austin and wrote the book
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:17.480]  on exposing inside job attacks. And it isn't that it bothers me that you attack me out
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:21.360]  there. It bothers me that you're not doing good work. You're not waking other people
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:27.160]  up. You're spending most of your time nittying and attacking people in the movement. If someone
[1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:32.640]  doesn't want to have a site with pictures of Jews with big noses with Nazi paintings
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:37.600]  from World War II because they don't hate Jews and because they also know that that
[1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:42.760]  turns people against us. Then don't be mad at us that we haven't joined your little hate
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:48.680]  movement controlled by Mossad which is meant to make anybody criticizing Israel look stupid.
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:56.160]  Get a little more sophisticated. And the same thing goes for the hate the Catholics crowd
[1:55:56.160 --> 1:56:01.320]  all of them. We are in you are wrong. I am for real. I have woken up tens of millions
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:07.360]  of people with my listeners help because they have taken action and they have gotten involved.
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:14.360]  So all of you stop nittying stop in fighting stop responding to it. Move forward. Why do
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:19.280]  you think we are changes under attack from Ireland to New York to Austin Texas? Why do
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:23.600]  you think I'm getting death threats? Why do you think I've been physically attacked?
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:27.120]  Why do you think I've gone through all manner of stuff you can't imagine because we're having
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:33.400]  an effect. We're now have the Pentagon having their operatives put out audio tapes claiming
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:44.520]  that 9-11 truths getting orders from Ahmed Dinajid. They are panicking. They are scared.
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:49.000]  They carried out the attacks and the New World Order knows we know now. So they're desperately
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:52.640]  going to try to make it just about Israel. Whether you think Israel did it or not and
[1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:56.240]  there's no doubt Israel's involved but the whole New World Order is. Just want to say
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:01.120]  it's bigger than that. Doesn't absolve them. If you've got five guys robbing a bank they're
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:07.720]  all five just as guilty. But they know that people are scared to talk about Israel, scared
[1:57:07.720 --> 1:57:12.640]  to criticize it so they want to tag the movement anti-Semitic. One of the few things that can
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:16.800]  beat us. Do you want them to get away with the terror? Then get more sophisticated right
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:23.760]  now. Don't take the bait fools. We want them to take our bait. Not the other way around.
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:30.120]  We want the biggest movement we can get. This is chess ladies and gentlemen but it isn't
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:37.760]  a big game. It's life and death now. And they want to tie us to Al Qaeda slash Iran. Doesn't
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:42.520]  matter the two or opposite groups. That's the talking point. Do you understand that
[1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:50.560]  that is a major talking point? They the enemy has got their main guns firing at us. I'm
[1:57:50.560 --> 1:57:54.040]  under surveillance. Everything else you can imagine ladies and gentlemen. I'm doing this
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:58:02.600]  for you. I'm doing this for the children. I'm doing this for liberty in our future.
[1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:09.440]  I put it all in God's hands. Get terror storm. Get in game. Get other 9-11 films. Make copies.
[1:58:09.440 --> 1:58:13.320]  Get them out like your life depends on it. Because the future of this country and our
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:18.640]  economic life does. They want to unify us around the government so we'll accept giving
[1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:22.760]  up our liberties, giving up our pension funds. You're the target. But for them to be able
[1:58:22.760 --> 1:58:26.960]  to rape you, they've got to get you to rally around the flag so they can have their way
[1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:56.120]  with you. Do you understand?
[1:58:56.120 --> 1:59:01.520]  For thousands of years their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World
[1:59:01.520 --> 1:59:10.120]  Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first
[1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:15.560]  time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn
[1:59:15.560 --> 1:59:18.960]  the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:59:18.960 --> 1:59:26.800]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.

[1:59:47.040 --> 2:00:01.280]  GCN Radio Network. Big government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[2:00:01.280 --> 2:00:11.160]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. We are going
[2:00:11.160 --> 2:00:17.440]  in against what you could figuratively describe as the Death Star. We are taking direct fire
[2:00:17.440 --> 2:00:22.960]  by the national, international batteries. They are saying that if you say 9-11's an
[2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:27.560]  inside job, you're with Iran, you're with Al Qaeda. Let me explain. The Intel Center
[2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:32.040]  admittedly has been caught by Wired Magazine, computer experts and others putting their
[2:00:32.040 --> 2:00:41.240]  logo in the same video pixel upload as the supposed Al Qaeda videos to the point of where
[2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:45.280]  they now release them through other parties and don't put the logos on or release audio
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:51.040]  tapes and won't even say where it comes from because they've been caught. This is one of
[2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:54.720]  the final pieces. Not only do we know they carried out the attacks, lied to us, took
[2:00:54.720 --> 2:01:00.080]  us to war, the fact that they're always uploading and having the grandson of the ADL head, Adam
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:05.840]  Gadan, sit up there with a turban on his head saying, I'm going to kill you, Allah Akbar,
[2:01:05.840 --> 2:01:12.080]  the fact that the government and former CIA commanders, Senior Military Psyop Intelligence
[2:01:12.080 --> 2:01:16.720]  Officer Jim Mileneck, who works directly for Donald Rumsfeld, running eye defense in
[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:25.080]  the Intel Center, do you understand that Rumsfeld's people directly upload these? Don't you understand
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:31.880]  what they did to us on 9-11? Aren't you mad about that? I just can't, I want to, oh man,
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:36.600]  I want to get these traitors. I want to bring them to justice. Do they just get to sit here
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:40.080]  and do this to us? Paul Watson, I'm bringing you up for this segment and the next on No
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:45.240]  Notice because you wrote this article about this today. This is the key, the smoking gun
[2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:51.480]  is these fake videos and fake audios coming from them where they got their own boys making
[2:01:51.480 --> 2:01:57.040]  these videos. That proves they're behind it right there, Watson. It's a key nexus point.
[2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:02.760]  Go ahead. That's correct, Alex. Intel Center, who told
[2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:09.320]  us that this alzuhiri audio tape would be released three weeks ago, were also behind
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:16.280]  the release of the last bin laden tape, which turned out was five years old, but they claimed
[2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:22.080]  that it was new. And of course, to judge the impact that these tapes used to have compared
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:28.720]  to now, consider the fact that right before the 2004 election, Osama bin Laden came out
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:34.760]  and basically stumped for Bush. Both Kerry and Bush admitted that that tape is what swung
[2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:41.800]  the election. Now, they have a somewhat different effect, but the policy still continues. I
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:46.520]  mean, you remember the state of beheading videos two or three years ago, they suddenly
[2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:53.680]  stopped, but we still have these videos of alzuhiri and Adam Gadahn or Adam Perlman coming
[2:02:53.680 --> 2:03:02.200]  out on a regular basis. And the Intel Center run by all these spooks
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:08.640]  is are the ones uploading it. Let me explain. They're putting their Intel Center bug in
[2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:15.000]  the same video layer as the supposed original Al-Qaeda screed at the bottom. They're making
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  them, Paul. That's right. The wired computer expert came out and provided a detailed PDF
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:29.720]  analysis of that, showing that they were adding the Al-Qaeda brand logo at the same time as
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:35.160]  their own. And then the same expert a day later, even though he had, you know, he would
[2:03:35.160 --> 2:03:41.200]  have presented everything in a technical format, reversed his position, which was very suspicious
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:45.600]  to say the least. Well, he didn't really reverse. He just said, well, it's not conclusive,
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:50.680]  but it shows it. We'd already at the office on big screen TVs blown this stuff up years
[2:03:50.680 --> 2:03:56.440]  ago and could see it the same layer for those that don't work in video. You don't understand.
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:02.920]  It's in the same layer. Go ahead. Well, the smoking gun for us, which is when we really
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:10.040]  went big on this, you know, a couple of years ago, 18 months ago, was when they released
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:19.400]  the so-called laughing hijackers tape in October 2006. And that was the alleged hijackers Atta
[2:04:19.400 --> 2:04:27.080]  and Zyad Jara apparently attending a 2000 bin Laden speech. But the footage was filmed
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:33.040]  by a security agency, but then released six years later as if it was new material from
[2:04:33.040 --> 2:04:38.160]  Al Qaeda. But then it turned out that it was really a TV dramatization from British television.
[2:04:38.160 --> 2:04:43.520]  We'll be right back with Paul Watson on the other side. Are you listening, police? Do

[2:05:47.840 --> 2:05:52.880]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[2:05:52.880 --> 2:05:57.840]  disease such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat,
[2:05:57.840 --> 2:06:02.020]  what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles. It's these choices that
[2:06:02.020 --> 2:06:06.800]  cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease. The easiest way to reduce disease
[2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:12.000]  causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water. At SnyderHealth.com, we offer

[2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:48.360]  Shaikh, some of who cares.
[2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:54.160]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:54.160 --> 2:07:59.400]  All right, I got a massive news blitz coming up here in just a moment, but finishing up,
[2:07:59.400 --> 2:08:04.240]  Paul, there's hundreds of points you make in the article. Hundreds. I mean, this guy
[2:08:04.240 --> 2:08:12.520]  commanding CIA attack forces against the Serbs admitted that's the real Zahari. We've got
[2:08:12.520 --> 2:08:17.480]  these other guys. I mean, he's definitely a spook. And then now the AP later in the
[2:08:17.480 --> 2:08:21.600]  article says, oh, well, we can't confirm this audio. It's just on the internet, but it's
[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:26.880]  big national news and it will be reported as fact. And then now they already have the
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:32.240]  talking point that we're al-Qaeda and we bombed this, we bombed that in New York. Now we're
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:37.160]  working with Iran because we say the government's behind the terror. I mean, they treat the
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:42.720]  public Paul like that, like they're talking to basically mentally retarded people.
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:48.120]  Oh yeah, because that propaganda at its base level is the most effective. You keep it,
[2:08:48.120 --> 2:08:53.720]  keep it simple. Otherwise, you know, they won't understand it. But going back to Al
[2:08:53.720 --> 2:09:00.720]  the Harway, I mean, he appeared two years running before the state of the union speech
[2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:11.320]  in 2006, 2007, attacking Bush's policy in Iraq just weeks after Dick Cheney and former
[2:09:11.320 --> 2:09:17.500]  press secretary Tony Snow had circulated this talking point that skeptics of the occupation
[2:09:17.500 --> 2:09:24.000]  of Iraq and skeptics about the troop surge were al-Qaeda sympathizers. And then Al-Zohari
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:30.160]  pops up right before Bush's state of the union speech and say exactly, you know, the thing
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:35.200]  that would justify them calling for troop surge skeptics to be linked with al-Qaeda.
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:42.360]  So it jives perfectly with the neocons propaganda at every point. But another perspective is
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:48.000]  to say, well, if they are having to directly engage us and propagandize in these media
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:53.400]  stunts, then it shows that we're having an effect and that we have influence. Otherwise,
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:10:03.440]  they just ignore us. Paul, it's scary to know. I mean, this is when you really know the
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:08.640]  government did it. All the scientific evidence, all the lying and saying Saddam was behind
[2:10:08.640 --> 2:10:14.040]  it about WMDs, the troops massed around Afghanistan the months before to invade, Bush signing
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:18.200]  the launch orders, Marvin Bush running security in the World Trade Centers, his mother writing
[2:10:18.200 --> 2:10:24.480]  about it in their autobiography, the NORAD drills, the stand down, the 777 drills, all
[2:10:24.480 --> 2:10:30.960]  of it. But when you realize that former CIA and defense intelligence operatives in psych
[2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:37.840]  warfare run the websites uploading this and that it's their logo and they're doing it
[2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:44.560]  on a sound stage. I mean, these people are bad, man. That is the absolute proof right
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:50.040]  there for anybody. It's just disgusting what the scum that runs this government did on
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:55.880]  9 11. I just can't believe they'd kill 3000 of us. And but I guess that's a military mindset.
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:11:00.440]  It's just, I can't believe this is my life. I can't believe we live with these nuts running
[2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:04.840]  things. I, I can't believe the public still brainwashed and doesn't understand Paul.
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:12.680]  Well, that's correct. But again, if they're having to do this, you know, directly link
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:20.160]  in 9 11 truth movement people with being sympathetic towards America's so-called enemies, then
[2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:25.560]  it shows that they're scared. They're frightened of us. What's interesting to me is that, you
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:32.560]  know, according to John McCain, Al Qaeda and Iran are in alliance. So if they're in alliance,
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:38.160]  then why is Al Qaeda the number two slamming Iran? You can't have it both ways.
[2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:42.880]  By the way, Paul, since you raised that, he kept saying speeches in the Middle East where,
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:45.720]  where it was really ridiculous, you know, because they're not as dumb down and they
[2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:49.880]  know their own politics and their own religious divisions. He would say in press conferences
[2:11:49.880 --> 2:11:54.280]  that, you know, Iran's with Al Qaeda running the Al Qaeda attacks and all saw her as Al
[2:11:54.280 --> 2:11:59.280]  Qaeda. And then, you know, the president of Jordan, the king, others would say, no, no,
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:04.840]  you can't say that kind of like whenever Bush at the White House with the unicol executive
[2:12:04.840 --> 2:12:10.920]  Karzai, Mohammed Karzai said that Iran was running Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Karzai said,
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:14.560]  no, no, no, they're helping because he was like, Mr. President, he said, this is on Afghan
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:18.600]  TV. You can't say that. And Bush said, no, you were wrong. They are Al Qaeda. And he
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:23.720]  said, okay, yes, sir, they're with Al Qaeda because it's like saying Superman is lax
[2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:29.720]  Luther. I mean, it's just, it's just, that's only for the idiot that we are in this country.
[2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:35.920]  We will buy that far. And it's just totally discredits everybody. And so, you know, you
[2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:40.680]  raised that point. And I said on air when McCain said that, I said, McCain isn't saying
[2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:46.280]  this because he's senile at 70 something years old. McCain is saying this because this is
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:52.960]  the policy to lie. And then McCain, what two weeks ago before Congress in the Senate, McCain
[2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:58.480]  said to when he was talking to Betrayus, he said, you know, is not Al Qaeda Iran. Betrayus
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:04.520]  said, yes, they are Al Qaeda. And so, see, that is they're lying to you folks. They treat
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:10.160]  you like your idiots. They carried out the damn attacks. What is it? You don't understand
[2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:15.440]  that killers, man, they're going to kill more of us if we don't do something about them.
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:19.320]  I'm risking my damn life. Excuse me. I don't mean to get mad. I apologize. I'm risking my
[2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:25.480]  life here. Paul is they're killing people locally in Austin now. This isn't a joke. Paul.
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:34.200]  No, it's not a joke. And again, the fact that they have to do this gives me hope that we
[2:13:34.200 --> 2:13:39.240]  are having a bigger and bigger influence. I mean, they've tried to, you had Geraldo
[2:13:39.240 --> 2:13:46.680]  Rivera trying to blame the bombing. I call it a bombing. It was basically a firework
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:52.600]  or something. The Times Square Military Recruitment Center and said it was, you know, it was the
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:59.160]  work of 9-11 truth activists or 9-11 truth anarchists. So they're basically equating
[2:13:59.160 --> 2:14:04.160]  us with terrorists and they have been for months. So this is just the next phase of
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:11.120]  that. The linkers with the great enemy of Iran to demonize us and sour public opinion
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:14.880]  towards the 9-11 truth movement because it's having a massive impact.
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:20.680]  I can't believe we're being forced to fight with these killers. Think about it, Paul.
[2:14:20.680 --> 2:14:26.720]  We're actually hurting them globally. People are seeing who they are and they are mad.
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:30.400]  I want to say to all of them in special ops that took part in this and the Israelis and
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:34.440]  the rest of them and the people in our government, no doubt, British were involved. The evidence
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:39.680]  shows, well, what have you become? Well, we know the Islamics really are a threat and
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:43.360]  we had to do this because you weren't ready to get ready to fight them. And then that's
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:47.880]  a bunch of bull. You fund all the radical Muslims to overthrow their secular governments
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:51.120]  and then you attack the innocent Serbs using them.
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:56.040]  You are criminals. It's because you want no bid contracts in domestic police states and
[2:14:56.040 --> 2:15:01.600]  contracts for your bosses to run the private contractors and so you can take our pension
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:06.440]  funds and do whatever you want domestically. This has nothing to do with fighting Muslims.
[2:15:06.440 --> 2:15:10.920]  How dare you fall back on that and say you carried out the attacks for our own good?
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:13.120]  You know that's a bunch of bull too. Watson?
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:20.440]  Well, what's interesting to me about this whole house over here, you think is supposedly
[2:15:20.440 --> 2:15:28.400]  he was asked 2000 questions and this was his response to one of them and his response was
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:36.600]  one sentence long. So the media have essentially picked out a one sentence response to a question
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:40.440]  out of 2000. But that's classic propaganda. They made
[2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:46.000]  it very simple so it couldn't be analyzed. Yeah, but they've chosen to run with headlines
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:53.640]  about him equating 9-11 comes very serious with Iran. At one question out of 2000 that
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:59.640]  answers that he gave. So they've focused in and picked this and ran with it. And it's
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:06.160]  obviously part of this sentiment to sour public opinion towards the 9-11 truth movement.
[2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:12.560]  Yeah, we're just completely screwed. We've got psychopathic killers with unlimited cash
[2:16:12.560 --> 2:16:18.440]  that own the banks running everything poisoning our water staging terror attacks, grandsons
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:25.600]  of the ADL head popping up in turbines. I mean, I just Paul Watson tell folks about
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:29.880]  the prison planet dot TV membership so we can have more capital to get the word out and
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:36.880]  expand what we're doing. And so they can also have high quality video the fourth hour. Well,
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:44.880]  yeah, we've just opened the service by offering live streaming, video streaming and archives
[2:16:44.880 --> 2:16:52.040]  which are available maximum two, three hours after the end of the show to subscribers.
[2:16:52.040 --> 2:16:58.280]  And as he said before is usually it goes on for an hour and a half, two hours, sometimes
[2:16:58.280 --> 2:17:05.680]  even three hours. And I've been watching it since it started and it's not only informative
[2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:10.480]  but it's very entertaining because it's kind of more off the hook approach that you've
[2:17:10.480 --> 2:17:15.960]  taken throwing in a bit of humor for people, you know, while giving them the real information
[2:17:15.960 --> 2:17:21.440]  on top of that. So I think people find it very interesting on top of everything else
[2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:29.520]  that they get, which is every Alex Jones video in four different download format. All the
[2:17:29.520 --> 2:17:36.120]  new videos are available in streaming flash so you can watch it as you would watch a YouTube
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:44.160]  video live, but it's in much higher quality. Again, we've got Alex's book, my book, plenty
[2:17:44.160 --> 2:17:50.320]  hundreds of audio interviews, hundreds more special video presentations. We had the JF
[2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:56.560]  case neat peak last week. We've got scores, more special presentations like that in high
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:18:05.560]  quality and we're adding new content to it all the time. So put it, you know, to throw
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:10.360]  fire into our valleys and find what we're doing. I think a lot of people see it as a
[2:18:10.360 --> 2:18:15.560]  good way to support us for what is little cost.
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:22.400]  Well, I just appreciate everything you're doing, Paul, and whatever happens in all
[2:18:22.400 --> 2:18:26.840]  of this, I know you're going to continue on with your work and they do kill me or set
[2:18:26.840 --> 2:18:31.000]  me up or imprison me folks know that you'll automatically know who all my enemies are
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:35.720]  in our own movement because they'll all intensify their attacks on me. So use whatever happens
[2:18:35.720 --> 2:18:40.880]  to me as an as a identifier of the enemy. And I'm not saying they're going to kill me,
[2:18:40.880 --> 2:18:43.960]  but I got a death threat last night and they put up on Wikipedia that I've been killed
[2:18:43.960 --> 2:18:49.720]  at the same time, very sick freaks. And I mean, did you hear all that, you know, with
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:56.600]  the local Palestinian peaceful activist, how his body was all sliced up open and signs
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:01.280]  of torture all over him? Same thing I got from news sources and they call it a suicide
[2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:06.760]  or he's all bound and naturally, naturally it's the suicide. If you're bound and gagged
[2:19:06.760 --> 2:19:12.280]  and the media unquestionably reported it as a suicide, well, remember Dr. David Kelly,
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:16.080]  he wrote emails to two friends saying, I've been told I'll be found dead in the woods
[2:19:16.080 --> 2:19:20.460]  if I don't shut up and then police come up and see five guys in black uniforms run away
[2:19:20.460 --> 2:19:24.840]  from his body. His wrist are slit with no blood at the scene and come out. He was, it's
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:30.080]  come out. He was murdered members of parliament. I mean, just they called it a suicide, Paul.
[2:19:30.080 --> 2:19:33.560]  They could hang me at the Super Bowl. Bush could pull the lever and they'd say I committed
[2:19:33.560 --> 2:19:39.200]  suicide and look, but in Nile isn't going to help you, America. You're the target of
[2:19:39.200 --> 2:19:44.440]  all of this. It's the guys in caves work for the bad guys. Paul wants some good job. Take
[2:19:44.440 --> 2:19:51.280]  care. I hope everybody will get his article at prison planet. It is a big idea. A new
[2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:58.680]  world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by a powerful government. It's known as the
[2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:05.160]  builder bird. But their objective being world domination or thousands of years, their dark
[2:20:05.160 --> 2:20:10.760]  order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of
[2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:19.040]  exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elites

[2:23:46.920 --> 2:24:06.960]  I don't think I've ever had a more important massive stack of news in front of me, and
[2:24:06.960 --> 2:24:10.840]  I haven't gotten to any of it with all the breaking stories and news and information
[2:24:10.840 --> 2:24:21.280]  today. Celica Stillo, former DEA agent, Vietnam Vet Sniper Police Officer, Sniper Vietnam
[2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:26.720]  Vet, then a police officer, then Border Patrol, I mean not Border Patrol DEA. He'll be joining
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:31.000]  us by how he's being set up and what's happening for an hour. In the last 30 minutes, I will
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:35.800]  news blitz. I will cover all of this. What's the type of news that I have here in front
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:43.440]  of me? I saw this on LewRockwell.com last night. I googled it and found articles in
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:48.480]  California defending this saying it's good. Now, remember when Aaron Russo said that Nick
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:52.920]  Rockefeller told him? We already have this in Texas and some other areas and in smaller
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:58.920]  towns. The police are allowed to drink and drive. The police are allowed to speed. Anyone
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:03.480]  who works for the government is basically God. One million people. This is confirmed.
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:07.720]  LewRockwell.com up on PrisonPlanet.com right now. Out of the way peasants, I want the
[2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:14.800]  guys to do a larger story on this and tie it in with Russo's info. You can find it on
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:21.200]  YouTube. PrisonPlanet.tv members can see it in super high quality, the whole interview.
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:25.080]  Out of the way peasants, readers have been shocked to learn that California has about
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:29.640]  one million citizens who are literally above the law. Members and the illegal aliens are
[2:25:29.640 --> 2:25:34.920]  too, but they don't mention them. Members of this group, as a Register Front Page Article
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:39.160]  April 6th detail, this is the register who first reported it, can drive their cars as
[2:25:39.160 --> 2:25:43.400]  fast as they choose. They can drink a six pack of beer at the bar and then get behind
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:48.680]  the wheel and weave their way home. They can zoom in and out of traffic, run traffic lights,
[2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:54.320]  roll through stop signs, and ignore school crossing zones. That's a tyranny always works.
[2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:59.040]  They can ride on toll roads for free, park in illegal sports spots, and drive on high
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:04.080]  frequency vehicle lanes if they only have one passenger in their car, one person in
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:08.560]  the car. Chances are they will never have to pay a fine or get a traffic citation. They
[2:26:08.560 --> 2:26:12.440]  are a special class of people, basically exempt from the laws, the rest of us must follow.
[2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:18.440]  This is what Nick told them it would be like. This isn't a small number either. Drivers
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:24.880]  of one in 22 California cars and light trucks on the road have a special immunity which
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:29.600]  should cause our government leaders and law enforcement authorities always eager to protect
[2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:34.520]  us from any perceived problem or discrimination or special privilege to demand a fix to the
[2:26:34.520 --> 2:26:39.360]  real public safety threat. Think about this, what this means. A million drivers who can
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:45.960]  engage and endanger our lives with near impunity, I can hear it now, they're ought to be a law.
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:49.840]  Yeah, like in New York, we'd have off duty cops, this is in the new film, walk right
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:53.920]  up and just punch us, hit us in front of cops, and they all just laugh. They go, get this,
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:57.960]  my bads, they pull their badge out and show it to the camera, I'll do whatever I want,
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:27:05.880]  boom, punch you right in the face. I mean literally, like demons, demons, this country
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:13.920]  is demon run, ladies and gentlemen. But instead of pursuing for a fix, most legislatures are
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:19.240]  trying to expand the program so that even more people can have the special, we're above
[2:27:19.240 --> 2:27:24.920]  the law license plates. What gives? The answer is a sickly obvious. The special people are
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:30.440]  those who work for law enforcement or other government agencies or their family members.
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:34.600]  And then it goes into a huge article detailing it all with mainstream media links. But the
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:40.720]  media in California says it's good. Folks, one in 10 is about as soon going to be one
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:46.400]  of these people. Well, one in one out of two is already government. It's where you can't
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:49.520]  help work for the government. I'm not saying everybody works for the government, it's bad.
[2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:53.120]  The point is, is that the government controls everything. One in 10 is going to be homeland
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:28:00.640]  security related. I was looking at the numbers, it's already one in like 16, higher in some
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:06.720]  areas. Do you understand what this means? I mean, they are God and they're all going
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:11.800]  to have the special badges and the special continuity of government and hundreds of thousands
[2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:17.600]  of executives and infra-guard have shoot to kill power and millions of truck drivers
[2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:24.760]  and 52,000 preachers going up from 26,000. I mean, it's, it's over folks, just stuzzy
[2:28:24.760 --> 2:28:28.680]  tattletales and there's no terrorist. There's not a lot of real crime. They're going to
