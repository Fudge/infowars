[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:05.092]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this is a massive radio show today.
[00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:06.353]  Huge breaking news.
[00:00:06.353 --> 00:00:11.016]  Huge, massive developments in the ten minutes before I went on air.
[00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:36.616]  Huge developments on two different major fronts.
[00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:38.337]  Well, there's actually three developments.
[00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:46.402]  I got a death threat last night that I'm not going to detail because I don't like to help people terrorize my family.
[00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:54.508]  And then at the same time, someone went into the Wikipedia file and said that I'd committed suicide yesterday, coinciding with the death threat.
[00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:14.544]  And, uh, I was basically told, uh, that I need to shut up about this case of Raed Hamed, the local Palestinian, um, activist, the American citizen, the school teacher, who the evidence shows was murdered.
[00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:18.766]  And then they claimed suicide and then was bound and gagged.
[00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:24.889]  And, uh, last night I started realizing that it probably is a murder because of the threats and other things that were happening.
[00:01:25.683 --> 00:01:29.026]  Then I learned this morning about the Wikipedia entry that wasn't done as a joke.
[00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:40.617]  You know, it was implied, kind of with a criminology type, or psychological mindset of, you know, Alex Jones went into his bathroom and was threatening to kill himself.
[00:01:40.617 --> 00:01:41.658]  His wife called the police.
[00:01:41.658 --> 00:01:50.486]  When he learned that she'd called the police, he did kill himself, which shows a kind of copper government mind, because that's really how people a lot of times commit suicide, is they're threatening it
[00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:58.237]  I've seen a lot of cases like that in the news, and then someone calls the police, and it escalates, so they commit suicide.
[00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:01.199]  And we're gonna track, we're trying to track back exactly who did that.
[00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:09.564]  We know who basically posted the identity, but we're trying to ferret in and drill in and find out who that person is.
[00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:18.790]  Now, I got in this morning, and I got a call by pretty much the leader of the Islamic community, well not pretty much, in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.771]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:29.744]  The individual who washed Hamid's body in Islamic customs, also Jewish customs.
[00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:32.347]  Jesus was washed, as you know.
[00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:36.571]  Ladies and gentlemen, he was tortured.
[00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:38.693]  No wonder we're getting death threats over this.
[00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:42.737]  People do not want it to come out that they murdered this guy.
[00:02:42.737 --> 00:02:44.098]  This is a serious whodunit.
[00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:59.421]  And yesterday it broke here on the air with the treasurer of his organization, the last person he talked to via telephone, according to phone records.
[00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:05.264]  He told me that what appeared to be Israelis with machine guns had been talking to the neighbors.
[00:03:05.264 --> 00:03:07.164]  Mr. Hammett had talked to his neighbors.
[00:03:07.164 --> 00:03:12.507]  They said that it was foreigners with machine guns, asking if they could go in their backyard, that they'd been surveilling him.
[00:03:12.507 --> 00:03:13.207]  He had seen them.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.582]  Oh man, this is just horrible.
[00:03:17.582 --> 00:03:23.526]  And of course, Israel has said in the Associated Press and in UPI six years ago they will kill U.S.
[00:03:23.526 --> 00:03:24.647]  citizens on U.S.
[00:03:24.647 --> 00:03:32.092]  territory if they aid Palestinians in any way.
[00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:35.395]  People ask me to report on this stuff, and I do, because it's important.
[00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:42.196]  Here we are, tip of the spear, as usual, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:42.196 --> 00:04:04.189]  I don't know why God put me in this position throughout my life, but certainly everything's intensifying, and my heckles have been up, my cackles have been up on the back of my neck since yesterday afternoon, with my sixth sense telling me, uh, danger, Will Robinson, danger, danger, as I sit right here in Austin, Texas, where they threw this guy in the lake.
[00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.849]  This poor man.
[00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.942]  So that's coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:26.751]  The other big news is so massive, is so stunning, is so off the charts, is so transparent, that when I read this 15 minutes ago, I staggered.
[00:04:26.751 --> 00:04:28.612]  I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:30.033]  This is a separate subject.
[00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:30.673]  This is just
[00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:37.239]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:46.165]  When we get back, it's just... The next four hours, ladies and gentlemen, are going to be a very important transmission, one of the most important we have ever done.
[00:04:46.165 --> 00:04:48.807]  Call everybody you know, tell them to tune in right now.
[00:04:48.807 --> 00:04:54.111]  This is massive.
[00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:55.532]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:55.532 --> 00:04:58.355]  A new world order.
[00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:02.778]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:06.066]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:08.869]  Put their objective being world domination.
[00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:12.033]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:19.361]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.383 --> 00:05:27.827]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:31.709]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:34.271]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:35.432]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.432 --> 00:05:36.212]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:37.493]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:37.493 --> 00:05:38.474]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.474 --> 00:05:39.635]  That's what happens here.

[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.142]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.263]  You have been warned.
[00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:56.687]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:05:56.687 --> 00:06:01.211]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:06:01.211 --> 00:06:09.098]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:06:09.418 --> 00:06:12.519]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:20.161]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:25.983]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:31.824]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:35.065]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:38.948]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:44.031]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:46.933]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:47.113]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.390]  Fact.
[00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:59.394]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:06:59.394 --> 00:07:03.737]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:07:03.737 --> 00:07:11.422]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:12.162]  The solution.
[00:07:12.162 --> 00:07:16.125]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:07:16.365 --> 00:07:25.453]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[00:07:25.453 --> 00:07:33.621]  Detoxification works with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:38.145]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[00:07:38.365 --> 00:07:38.986]  We're good to go.
[00:07:58.188 --> 00:08:03.031]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:03.031 --> 00:08:04.613]  You want answers?
[00:08:04.613 --> 00:08:06.174]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:06.174 --> 00:08:10.357]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:19.663]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.663 --> 00:08:23.946]  Ultra-massive news breaking in T-minus 22 minutes.
[00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:35.781]  In the suspicious death of Mr. Hamid here in Austin, Texas, the U.S.
[00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:42.347]  citizen, Palestinian activist, peaceful, a non-violent activist, part of the peace group.
[00:08:42.347 --> 00:08:49.954]  Bound, thrown in the river, very suspicious behavior by the police, first believing it was murder, then suddenly changing their story and saying suicide.
[00:08:53.058 --> 00:09:04.890]  We have been contacted by the head of the Austin Islamic Center, the doctor that runs it, who I see on television all the time, who washed his body as Islamic custom.
[00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:14.720]  And I talked to him this morning, five minutes before airtime, just as I was digesting the massive news, and he said, clearly, signs of torture, abuse.
[00:09:15.615 --> 00:09:22.040]  Which is the same thing we got leaked from people at two different TV stations who are afraid, by the way, to go public.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.984]  They heard the scanners.
[00:09:25.984 --> 00:09:27.725]  I mean, I'm wishing it was suicide.
[00:09:27.725 --> 00:09:29.607]  I'm wishing the government wasn't so evil.
[00:09:29.607 --> 00:09:32.769]  I'm so tired of it.
[00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:38.594]  I'm wishing I didn't have to risk my life doing this, but I'm too far into it to ever back off.
[00:09:38.594 --> 00:09:39.675]  It's point of no return.
[00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:44.487]  It's like I'm a ship going across the ocean and I'm 75% there.
[00:09:44.487 --> 00:09:46.472]  If I turn back, there's no way I'm making it back.
[00:09:46.472 --> 00:09:47.715]  And I wouldn't turn back if I could.
[00:09:49.284 --> 00:09:50.485]  Okay, here's the big news.
[00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:53.906]  Paul Watson, I made him aware of it about 15 minutes ago.
[00:09:53.906 --> 00:10:00.489]  He is on it doing a detailed analysis for PrisonPlanet.com that will go up in T-minus two hours.
[00:10:00.489 --> 00:10:06.472]  This is the highest level priority for InfoWarriors if you choose to take this mission.
[00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.213]  And I'm not joking when I say that.
[00:10:08.213 --> 00:10:14.075]  We have to cram this down the throat of every neocon website, every neocon radio show.
[00:10:14.075 --> 00:10:16.577]  We have to pump it into all of the
[00:10:18.374 --> 00:10:27.268]  New World Order, Defense Complex, Media Outlets, ABC, Fox, all their message boards, MSNBC, Target, Saturation, hit them everywhere.
[00:10:27.268 --> 00:10:30.654]  I need near instant
[00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:37.778]  A recording of the information I'm about to bring out and then YouTube uploads with detailed documents over my statements.
[00:10:37.778 --> 00:10:40.000]  I do not have the staff to coordinate this.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:49.226]  I'm calling on you with your skills out there to do this so we can have a full combined effort on the enemy force with what they've launched.
[00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:56.531]  This follows exactly as we predicted in articles last week that it would.
[00:10:56.531 --> 00:11:00.253]  This is hidden in plain view what you are about to hear, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.278]  This is Associated Press.
[00:11:06.278 --> 00:11:09.299]  This was released two hours ago.
[00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:11.701]  I learned of it about 25 minutes ago.
[00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:13.682]  Al-Qaeda number two.
[00:11:13.682 --> 00:11:15.723]  Brace yourselves.
[00:11:15.723 --> 00:11:23.688]  Al-Qaeda number two says 9-11 theory propagated by Iran.
[00:11:23.688 --> 00:11:27.930]  Steve Watson last week for Infowars.net.
[00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.371]  He does have a degree in political science.
[00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:30.312]  Very intelligent man.
[00:11:32.054 --> 00:11:48.300]  Made the point that Iran was putting out statements and bringing out the fact that many of the Iranian radicals, including those that took hostages, were funded by the CIA to do it, and were given arms and weapons to hold the hostages in a staged event.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:55.143]  It's like they used the same Islamist to overthrow Mohammad Mosaddegh in 53, then they put the Shah in.
[00:11:55.143 --> 00:11:57.723]  When they got tired of him, they brought in Islamic radicals.
[00:11:57.723 --> 00:11:58.944]  It's all staged.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.361]  At the highest levels.
[00:12:03.361 --> 00:12:09.202]  And many top political scientists, by the way, believe that, and BBC reporter Greg Pallis and many others.
[00:12:09.202 --> 00:12:11.762]  This is how cloak and dagger works.
[00:12:11.762 --> 00:12:27.886]  And Ahmadinejad showed himself to be an operative when he came out and said that world government was a good thing, when he came out and said 9-11 happened four years ago last week, and Steve said, look at how Al-Qaeda and the Shiite-led Iran
[00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:33.555]  Constantly make statements that help the globalists.
[00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:41.424]  Now remember, last week Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu came out and publicly stated that 9-11 was good for Israel.
[00:12:41.424 --> 00:12:47.551]  Well yeah, we've got the neocon documents where they said we need massive terror attacks in the US or we can't get our agenda through.
[00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:55.747]  We have neocon pundits writing articles for the Philadelphia News, saying 9-11 was wonderful, we need another one.
[00:12:55.747 --> 00:13:04.669]  We have, three years ago, before they admitted all this, internal Republican memos saying they need another attack, and fast.
[00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:08.330]  Gary Hart, on the Democratic side of the CFR, is calling for the same thing.
[00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.051]  Wrote a threatening letter to Iran, to the rest of the Imams, who are not controlled, many of them.
[00:13:12.051 --> 00:13:15.892]  There's only one camp that is, from the evidence we've got inside Iranian system.
[00:13:18.027 --> 00:13:20.610]  Shane, we will stage attacks and blame it on Iran.
[00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:26.576]  Don't think just because 80% of Americans don't want to attack you, that the elements that control the U.S.
[00:13:26.576 --> 00:13:27.457]  won't stage events.
[00:13:27.457 --> 00:13:31.841]  And then he listed Tonkin, he listed the Maine, he listed a bunch of other events.
[00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:34.344]  And said, we provocateur.
[00:13:34.344 --> 00:13:36.006]  But let me get to the main issue at hand.
[00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:54.188]  Remember Colin Powell on the eve of the war was testifying before the UN and Congress, and in Congress, five hours before it came out, he testified that Al Jazeera had just aired a new Bin Laden tape where he said that he worked with Saddam Hussein.
[00:13:55.723 --> 00:14:09.891]  Now, why would Bin Laden come out and, even if it was Bin Laden, they always just produce these audiotapes out of nowhere, and the media always just says it's real, and then you track it, it's uploaded to Neocon or CIA-run websites like Intel Center, admittedly.
[00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:24.439]  And Wired Magazine and others have had computer specialists look at the bugs on the video, you know, the scrawl on the bottom, and the Intel Center logo is uploaded at the same time, in the same video layer, as the so-called Al-Qaeda bugs, and the Islamic Screed.
[00:14:25.447 --> 00:14:32.413]  They have Adam Gadon, the grandson of the ADL head, in English saying he works for Al-Qaeda and is going to attack us?
[00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:35.576]  I mean, how dumb do we have to be?
[00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:38.579]  How in our face does it have to get?
[00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:40.941]  How ridiculous!
[00:14:40.941 --> 00:14:50.109]  Right when they need to hear that Al-Qaeda, a radical Saudi Arabian Wahhabist sect, supposedly works
[00:14:52.546 --> 00:15:00.668]  A radical sub-sect of the Wahhabi sect supposedly worked with the secular CIA-installed Saddam Hussein, who they then backstabbed.
[00:15:00.668 --> 00:15:07.730]  Totally ridiculous, admitted to be a fraud now, but on the eve of the war, Colin Powell goes before Congress.
[00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:17.013]  We wrote articles about it on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.net at the time in 2003 on the eve of the war, and said, even Bin Laden admits he works with Saddam.
[00:15:17.702 --> 00:15:27.267]  And the media all ran out of the chamber and came back in and the congressman said, Mr. Powell, Secretary Powell, there's no such tape on Al Jazeera.
[00:15:27.267 --> 00:15:29.128]  They've gotten their time zone off.
[00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:32.230]  They're sloppy!
[00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.231]  They got their time zone.
[00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:36.913]  He said, well, it will be soon then.
[00:15:36.913 --> 00:15:44.217]  Every time they want to attack Somalia, the neocons do, Al Qaeda comes out and says, we work with Somalia.
[00:15:44.893 --> 00:15:56.003]  Every time, uh, I mean, Bush is in trouble or the neoconagent is in trouble, Bin Laden or Al Zawahiri releases a new tape, a new audio tape.
[00:15:56.003 --> 00:16:04.131]  They release scores of videotapes that later comes out or re-edits of 1999, 2000, 2001 videos.
[00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:06.273]  Remember the national, uh, three years ago?
[00:16:06.273 --> 00:16:07.294]  They aired all over the U.S.
[00:16:08.943 --> 00:16:16.707]  The two lead hijackers supposedly at a Bin Laden training camp and showed Bin Laden and then showed the crowd and showed close-ups of their faces.
[00:16:16.707 --> 00:16:19.628]  And I instantly said, those look like CG.
[00:16:19.628 --> 00:16:21.249]  Pixar does a better job of that.
[00:16:21.249 --> 00:16:23.110]  It looks like Disney.
[00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.192]  And then it came out, WeBrokeItInfoWars.net, just linking to the mainstream news.
[00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:40.952]  That that had been used in a 2002 British documentary and on the screen, but they blew it up when our media put it out, it said computer simulation.
[00:16:40.952 --> 00:16:47.437]  They cut their heads on to men in the crowd, zoomed in on them, put it out on TV saying it was fake.
[00:16:47.437 --> 00:16:49.518]  It was a simulation of them being there.
[00:16:50.979 --> 00:16:52.620]  Which has its own propaganda effect.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.181]  People don't notice at the bottom, it said simulation.
[00:16:55.181 --> 00:17:02.143]  But then by the time it hits our news, they just blow it up a little, zoom in on the video, and cut off that it was a computer rendering.
[00:17:02.143 --> 00:17:08.245]  They put computer renderings on TV, and say it's real!
[00:17:08.245 --> 00:17:17.308]  And take it from TV shows, where they admit it's fake, thinking we're so dumb, or that we don't have the media power to expose it.
[00:17:17.308 --> 00:17:19.149]  Now I'm giving you background, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:20.169 --> 00:17:22.533]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[00:17:22.533 --> 00:17:34.791]  This guy, Al-Qaeda's deputy leader, al-Zawahiri, is out of Egypt, where they run all the fake Islamic groups, they use the staged terror as a way to keep the corrupt government in power.
[00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:35.552]  That's been admitted.
[00:17:39.193 --> 00:17:56.224]  Their president, Hosni Mubarak, who's been in there, what, 30-something years, just constantly uses staged terror as a way to crack down, the staged elections to arrest people, admitted giant torture chambers, totally paid off by the globalists, and they've got this guy who's been an operative since he was 18 years old,
[00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:03.887]  Al Qaeda's number two says 9-11 theory propagated by Iran.
[00:18:03.887 --> 00:18:25.415]  So now when you say 9-11's an inside job, the media is so desperate with Jesse Ventura coming out, and German former Minister of Defense coming out, and Willie Nelson, and the best actress, Oscar winner this year, and engineers, and scientists, and physicists, that now the drumbeat, as the talking point's been for six months, if you talk about 9-11 truth, you work for Al Qaeda.
[00:18:26.261 --> 00:18:29.344]  If you talk about 9-11 truth, you're siding with the terrorist.
[00:18:29.344 --> 00:18:30.625]  It should be illegal.
[00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:31.866]  You should be arrested.
[00:18:31.866 --> 00:18:33.107]  You should be tortured.
[00:18:33.107 --> 00:18:35.249]  You should be sent to secret camps.
[00:18:35.249 --> 00:18:40.853]  That talking point was set on MSNBC, Fox, CNN, all unified in the same week.
[00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:42.135]  Government talking point.
[00:18:42.135 --> 00:18:43.456]  See the attack pattern.
[00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.017]  It's 100% guaranteed.
[00:18:45.017 --> 00:18:46.598]  We have them wide open.
[00:18:46.598 --> 00:18:51.703]  They carried out the attacks, they're running the propaganda offensive.
[00:18:51.703 --> 00:18:53.284]  Now the number two in Al-Qaeda,
[00:18:54.815 --> 00:18:59.959]  Who always says what they need, who always puts out a press release agreeing with the White House.
[00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:07.285]  He comes out and says, now remember, another Bin Laden, whether it was real or not, said that he didn't carry out the attacks and it was staged.
[00:19:07.285 --> 00:19:08.666]  That got ignored.
[00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:14.450]  Then they give you a fat guy in a video saying he did it, and then they do voice print.
[00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.733]  It's not the same guy, not even the same dialect, not even the same nose.
[00:19:17.733 --> 00:19:22.957]  They blurred the video, darkroom, major universities, US, Canada, England, France, all analyze it.
[00:19:23.633 --> 00:19:25.234]  Voice print, it's false.
[00:19:25.234 --> 00:19:26.755]  Linguistics, it's false.
[00:19:26.755 --> 00:19:28.257]  Speech patterns, false.
[00:19:28.257 --> 00:19:29.758]  Video, false.
[00:19:29.758 --> 00:19:36.523]  Uploaded in the same format with the government bugs on it.
[00:19:36.523 --> 00:19:38.684]  In the same video layers.
[00:19:38.684 --> 00:19:40.706]  Hundreds of other points.
[00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:43.087]  We'll tell you what this means when we get back on the other side.
[00:19:43.087 --> 00:19:45.689]  We're coming in, we're coming in hot.
[00:19:45.689 --> 00:19:47.411]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:19:47.411 --> 00:19:51.654]  Al Qaeda's number two says 9-11-3 propagated by Iran.
[00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.512]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:57.512 --> 00:20:06.977]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:06.977 --> 00:20:14.061]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:20.769]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:20.769 --> 00:20:31.564]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:32.745]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:33.706]  A new world order.
[00:20:33.706 --> 00:20:35.066]  In the near future.
[00:20:59.952 --> 00:21:03.035]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:03.035 --> 00:21:05.857]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:05.857 --> 00:21:08.639]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:21:08.639 --> 00:21:11.842]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:11.842 --> 00:21:19.148]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:27.626]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:31.508]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:31.508 --> 00:21:34.070]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.211]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.011]  They're not after money.
[00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:37.292]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:37.292 --> 00:21:38.273]  They're after power.
[00:21:38.273 --> 00:21:39.414]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:23:05.516 --> 00:23:16.579]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:23:16.579 --> 00:23:20.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.761]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:27.883]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.151]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:23:46.151 --> 00:23:54.396]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:23:54.396 --> 00:24:03.120]  Rumors spreadin' around
[00:24:06.394 --> 00:24:09.615]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've analyzed what they're doing.
[00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:12.976]  There is no doubt this is a 100% proof positive.
[00:24:12.976 --> 00:24:19.639]  This piece of propaganda only adds more evidence to the fact that they have totally staged the 9-11 attacks.
[00:24:19.639 --> 00:24:20.039]  Everything.
[00:24:23.721 --> 00:24:42.932]  Al Qaeda number two says 9-11 theory propagated by Iran AP Osama bin Laden's chief deputy on Tuesday denied a theory that Israel carried out the September 11th attacks and blamed Iran as a Shiite Hezbollah for spreading the idea to discredit the Sunni Al Qaeda strike against the US.
[00:24:42.932 --> 00:24:45.053]  Now notice they state it as if it's a fact.
[00:24:45.811 --> 00:24:51.853]  In all these propaganda pieces, it's always the same, when it's a fake video or fake audio, then later they admit this.
[00:24:51.853 --> 00:25:04.278]  The comments in a recording posted on an Islamic website reflected, they won't even give you the Islamic website, because used to they would, and we'd go find it was in Houston or DC, Virginia, and then you'd find out it was a neocon ADL front.
[00:25:04.278 --> 00:25:06.579]  We've got dozens of articles we wrote on that.
[00:25:06.579 --> 00:25:08.680]  You can go read them from 3, 4, 5, 6 years ago, 7 years ago.
[00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:11.842]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:11.842 --> 00:25:19.926]  The comments in the recording posted on the Islamic website reflected an increasing criticism by Al-Qaeda's number two leader.
[00:25:19.926 --> 00:25:28.271]  The comments in the recording posted on the Islamic website reflected an increasing criticism by Al-Qaeda's number two leader, al-Zawahiri, against Iran.
[00:25:28.271 --> 00:25:35.956]  He has accused Iran in recent messages of seeking to extend its power in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq, and through its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon.
[00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.153]  Now listen to this, here's the key.
[00:25:39.153 --> 00:25:45.283]  Later in the article, the authenticity of the two-hour audio recording could not be independently confirmed.
[00:25:45.283 --> 00:25:48.769]  Oh, why does the headline say unconfirmed audio?
[00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:50.152]  Remember how some kids...
[00:25:51.207 --> 00:25:56.089]  Did a video of chopping somebody's head off in San Francisco in the news for two days reported it as real?
[00:25:56.089 --> 00:26:03.971]  Because, you see, the media, the operatives at the AP, who are operatives at this high level, they just, you know, they don't talk to the guys that put out the fake vids.
[00:26:03.971 --> 00:26:05.272]  They just know it's an operation.
[00:26:05.272 --> 00:26:06.392]  They're supposed to put it out.
[00:26:06.392 --> 00:26:13.915]  So they got basically false-started on that with another fake video.
[00:26:13.915 --> 00:26:14.475]  Unbelievable.
[00:26:15.134 --> 00:26:29.783]  The authenticity of the two-hour audio recording could not be independently confirmed, but the voice sounded like past audio tapes from the terror leader and the posting where it was found bore the logo Al-Sanab, Al-Qaeda's official media arm.
[00:26:30.535 --> 00:26:35.617]  Which they've caught the Intel Center in the same video layer when they do videos.
[00:26:35.617 --> 00:26:36.358]  You understand?
[00:26:36.358 --> 00:26:37.498]  It's a fact.
[00:26:37.498 --> 00:26:39.479]  Because they can tell with the pixelation.
[00:26:39.479 --> 00:26:40.059]  You can blow it up.
[00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:42.720]  We can do it here at our office and we're not degreed experts in it.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:50.364]  You can see blowing up video if something was laid down in the original feed of the video or it was laid over later.
[00:26:50.364 --> 00:26:53.045]  Sticks out like a store thumb in the pixelation layers.
[00:26:54.033 --> 00:26:56.054]  You can look at what format the video's in.
[00:26:56.054 --> 00:26:57.395]  The computer tells you.
[00:26:57.395 --> 00:26:59.657]  That you know the shape of the pixels.
[00:26:59.657 --> 00:27:02.239]  What type of compression.
[00:27:02.239 --> 00:27:03.740]  And we deal with video here.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:04.300]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.641]  The experts have looked at these.
[00:27:05.641 --> 00:27:07.523]  I mean, this is mainstream news.
[00:27:07.523 --> 00:27:12.286]  It's fake!
[00:27:12.286 --> 00:27:14.828]  There's so many other facets to this.
[00:27:14.828 --> 00:27:18.390]  An audio tape that they don't say they can prove is real.
[00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.732]  Just like all the fat bin Laden tapes, the rest of it.
[00:27:20.732 --> 00:27:23.514]  Now remember, the FBI
[00:27:24.483 --> 00:27:39.892]  Local news, national news have all reported the FBI for six and almost seven years, coming up on the seventh anniversary here in about four months, will not say that he carried out 9-11 and will not indict him for it.
[00:27:39.892 --> 00:27:42.133]  He is not indicted.
[00:27:42.133 --> 00:27:47.516]  He is not listed nothing for the attacks.
[00:27:47.516 --> 00:27:50.698]  He is listed for the coal.
[00:27:50.698 --> 00:27:51.779]  Why is that?
[00:27:52.836 --> 00:28:07.630]  Now remember the BBC and others reported three months before 9-11 that in Pakistan a British ambassador went to see bin Laden in front of the press with the CIA and US military guarding him.
[00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:14.156]  Then he went to Dubai for kidney work and the report is died shortly after 9-11.
[00:28:14.156 --> 00:28:15.698]  Bandar Bush, the
[00:28:16.533 --> 00:28:23.337]  That's his nickname, the former Saudi ambassador to the U.S., best buddies with the Bushes, that's why he's called Bandar Bush.
[00:28:23.337 --> 00:28:29.480]  On Larry King one night, Larry King called him a coward and said he was bad, and Bandar said, don't talk about him that way, don't say bad things about Bin Laden.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:36.223]  You can see over there, the family gets all the contracts, building contracts, you know, they run everything for Mecca, you name it.
[00:28:36.223 --> 00:28:42.587]  They then get to be big heroes over there, and Bandar said, you don't talk bad about him, knowing that would be on Saudi TV.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.061]  Very sophisticated double game.
[00:28:47.061 --> 00:28:49.022]  Triple game.
[00:28:49.022 --> 00:28:54.224]  So we need an article exposing the fact that Bin Laden isn't on the FBI Most Wanted list.
[00:28:54.224 --> 00:29:01.487]  Every time they need him to, al-Zawahiri comes out and says... I mean, it's been over a hundred times.
[00:29:01.487 --> 00:29:03.048]  I can't even remember them all.
[00:29:03.048 --> 00:29:06.529]  Where he comes out and always agrees.
[00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:08.490]  And says, Al-Qaeda is doing quite well.
[00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.491]  Al-Qaeda launched this attack.
[00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:13.798]  You know, Al-Qaeda's working with Iran.
[00:29:13.798 --> 00:29:19.142]  Al-Qaeda's fighting Iran to confuse the public.
[00:29:19.142 --> 00:29:28.949]  I'm going to cover more of this, but huge breaking news in the mysterious death of Ra'ed Hamad.
[00:29:28.949 --> 00:29:31.331]  Ra'ed Hamad.
[00:29:31.331 --> 00:29:35.394]  Bound hand and foot, mouth, eyes, thrown into the river.
[00:29:35.394 --> 00:29:36.495]  They claim it's suicide.
[00:29:39.198 --> 00:29:42.280]  We'll be right back with a very special guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.001]  Lock yourselves in.
[00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:44.662]  This is huge.
[00:29:44.662 --> 00:29:46.063]  We're on the march.
[00:29:46.063 --> 00:29:48.585]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.585 --> 00:29:51.267]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.859 --> 00:29:57.220]  I'm Harold Williams.
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.303]  I know about martial law.
[00:29:59.303 --> 00:30:01.204]  I want to teach you how to survive it.

[00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:16.380]  I will tell you what you need to know to prepare for martial law.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.661]  Things are changing fast.
[00:30:17.961 --> 00:30:20.744]  We even email you a free weekly update.
[00:30:20.744 --> 00:30:28.150]  I teach you how to act around troops, where to put supplies, how to be safe during the worst part of martial law, which is in the beginning.
[00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.214]  Surviving this major life transition can be difficult, but possible.

[00:30:37.318 --> 00:30:38.939]  Go to survivemartiallaw.com or call 866-644-1933.
[00:30:38.939 --> 00:30:40.621]  Act today as there will be no warning.
[00:30:40.621 --> 00:30:40.721]  866-644-1933.
[00:30:40.721 --> 00:30:43.003]  Find the book at survivemartiallaw.com.
[00:30:43.003 --> 00:30:44.124]  Protect your family!
[00:30:54.321 --> 00:30:55.942]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[00:30:55.942 --> 00:30:59.605]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[00:30:59.605 --> 00:31:05.649]  This confederation of Evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[00:31:05.649 --> 00:31:09.732]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[00:31:09.732 --> 00:31:13.114]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[00:31:13.314 --> 00:31:14.475]  Liberty of conscience.
[00:31:14.475 --> 00:31:19.140]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:23.203]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[00:31:23.203 --> 00:31:25.806]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[00:31:25.806 --> 00:31:31.111]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[00:31:31.111 --> 00:31:34.774]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[00:31:34.774 --> 00:31:37.357]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[00:31:37.557 --> 00:31:40.321]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[00:31:40.321 --> 00:31:42.244]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[00:31:42.244 --> 00:31:43.846]  Jesus is coming soon!

[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.062]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:20.062 --> 00:33:34.850]  We have the treasurer of Ra'id Hamad, Ra'id Hamad's Palestinian aid organization, peaceful peace group that tried to bring school books and medicine to the Palestinians.
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:44.907]  He had told the treasurer of his organization that there had been what appeared to be, and the neighbors told him, Israelis with machine guns around his house, questioning them.
[00:33:44.907 --> 00:33:49.370]  AP, UPI reported that Israel said it will kill U.S.
[00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.192]  citizens that aid Palestinians in the U.S.
[00:33:52.192 --> 00:33:56.255]  That was a public government statement.
[00:33:56.255 --> 00:34:00.879]  Hamid, of course, disappeared last Tuesday.
[00:34:00.879 --> 00:34:02.981]  He was found a few days later in the
[00:34:04.259 --> 00:34:08.242]  Colorado River, known as Lady Bird Lake, here in Austin, Texas.
[00:34:08.242 --> 00:34:10.783]  We put out the call for witnesses, for family.
[00:34:10.783 --> 00:34:12.464]  The family is scared.
[00:34:12.464 --> 00:34:24.752]  The school teachers at the school, where he was a loved keyboard teacher, which taught, you know, computer and typing, believe he's been killed.
[00:34:24.752 --> 00:34:25.632]  Well, guess what?
[00:34:25.632 --> 00:34:32.957]  We have Dr. Ibrahim Dramali, who is the director
[00:34:34.986 --> 00:34:41.331]  He is the director of the Islamic Center of Greater Austin.
[00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:48.916]  That is the large, main Islamic organization here in Austin, Texas.
[00:34:48.916 --> 00:34:50.637]  This is the main organization.
[00:34:50.637 --> 00:34:52.638]  Thousands and thousands of members.
[00:34:52.638 --> 00:34:57.502]  They have Islamic school, a lot of other things.
[00:34:57.502 --> 00:35:01.104]  They are the spokesmen who you hear on local news when there is a religious issue.
[00:35:02.994 --> 00:35:09.616]  Uh, or whenever there's a religious holiday that is Islamic.
[00:35:09.616 --> 00:35:23.219]  He washed, as is Islamic custom, it's also the old Jewish custom, like with Jesus, washed the body of Mr. Hamad, who was found bound, arms, legs, mouth, eyes, in the river.
[00:35:24.173 --> 00:35:28.255]  I talked to people at two different TV stations who said that it looked like he had marks on him.
[00:35:28.255 --> 00:35:30.836]  It looked like he was in agony, that quote, been tortured.
[00:35:30.836 --> 00:35:33.157]  People, of course, were scared to speak out on this show.
[00:35:33.157 --> 00:35:34.358]  We said that we had this info.
[00:35:34.358 --> 00:35:39.640]  Well, here is the man who did the Islamic washing of him.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:51.626]  He is the head of the Islamic Center of Greater Austin, the major Islamic cultural and religious schooling organization in this major metropolitan city of a million people.
[00:35:52.584 --> 00:35:56.828]  He is going to give you the breaking news, and I guarantee you they've tried to tell the media this.
[00:35:56.828 --> 00:35:59.610]  We're going to find out why the media didn't report on it.
[00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.793]  The police, APD, first said they believed he'd been murdered.
[00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:05.916]  They then changed it overnight and said he committed suicide.
[00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:11.180]  Well, they said, we think he's committed suicide because, and then they tried to cover up what happened with an autopsy.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.722]  We're not sure.
[00:36:12.722 --> 00:36:15.104]  So we go to Ibrahim
[00:36:16.112 --> 00:36:19.633]  Dramali, the head of the Islamic Center for Greater Austin.
[00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:22.894]  Thank you for coming on the show, sir.
[00:36:22.894 --> 00:36:25.055]  Thank you for calling us.
[00:36:25.055 --> 00:36:26.456]  Thank you for emailing us.
[00:36:26.456 --> 00:36:28.076]  We were talking to him from the Islamic Center.
[00:36:28.076 --> 00:36:28.916]  We, of course, double-checked.
[00:36:28.916 --> 00:36:30.077]  He is the director there.
[00:36:30.077 --> 00:36:31.477]  We are talking to him from the center.
[00:36:31.477 --> 00:36:35.939]  We'll probably even try to have him in studio in the next few days because we're here in Austin.
[00:36:35.939 --> 00:36:37.019]  Sir, you've got the floor.
[00:36:37.019 --> 00:36:42.261]  Please slowly tell us exactly how he came in, what you saw, what happened.
[00:36:43.738 --> 00:36:49.084]  First, Mr. Jones, good morning, and thank you very much for supporting this issue.
[00:36:49.084 --> 00:36:57.474]  What makes me interested to speak with you, actually, you are against the war, and we are, as a Muslim community here, we are against the war in every place.
[00:36:57.474 --> 00:37:02.280]  And what I saw about Mr. Riyadh, his name is Riyadh, by the way, not Riyadh.
[00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.452]  Well, you know us Texans, we can't pronounce things correctly.
[00:37:05.452 --> 00:37:05.952]  But go ahead.
[00:37:05.952 --> 00:37:06.513]  Raya.
[00:37:06.513 --> 00:37:11.196]  Mr. Riyad, they brought him here and they asked me to wash him.
[00:37:11.196 --> 00:37:16.340]  And normally, this is our Islamic tradition, we have to wash the receipts.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.742]  And I entered the room where I was supposed to wash him.
[00:37:18.742 --> 00:37:20.343]  He was covered in a plastic bag.
[00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:25.842]  The moment I opened the plastic bag, it was a disaster.
[00:37:25.842 --> 00:37:29.444]  What I saw, no one can see.
[00:37:29.444 --> 00:37:33.626]  The people actually, the people with me, they are panicked.
[00:37:33.626 --> 00:37:34.547]  They cannot even help.
[00:37:34.547 --> 00:37:35.928]  They cannot do anything.
[00:37:35.928 --> 00:37:38.209]  And they have experience with this before.
[00:37:38.209 --> 00:37:49.936]  But he was cut from the right shoulder all the way to the stomach, and from the left shoulder all the way to the stomach again, and from the stomach all the way to the bladder.
[00:37:51.438 --> 00:37:58.922]  And lift open, and all his flesh and meat and blood comes out.
[00:37:58.922 --> 00:38:02.684]  And not only that, in his stomach, actually, there is a big plastic bag.
[00:38:02.684 --> 00:38:05.966]  All the stuff inside, you know, put him in a plastic bag.
[00:38:05.966 --> 00:38:13.510]  The other thing, his head, from all the back of his skull, is completely cut and empty completely.
[00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.031]  Empty.
[00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:16.592]  And I put, of course, to wash him.
[00:38:16.592 --> 00:38:18.133]  It's very hard to wash something like this.
[00:38:18.832 --> 00:38:30.483]  His arm, his wrist, it was also open and cut without not even one stitches to cover the sewing or to cover this cut.
[00:38:31.258 --> 00:38:33.099]  And it was really a disaster.
[00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:38.401]  What I saw, his eyes actually dropped all the way down because there's nothing supporting the eyes inside.
[00:38:38.401 --> 00:38:44.343]  Of course, when I watched him, I didn't know what to say.
[00:38:44.343 --> 00:38:46.884]  I cannot even sleep since Friday when I watched him.
[00:38:46.884 --> 00:38:48.165]  I cannot even sleep, believe me.
[00:38:48.165 --> 00:38:51.686]  I was in panic and I cannot even function.
[00:38:54.002 --> 00:38:56.043]  Please continue.
[00:38:56.043 --> 00:38:57.885]  Now, to be clear, I'm sorry about getting the name wrong.
[00:38:57.885 --> 00:39:07.131]  I was calling it Riyadh, and then people corrected me on the pronunciation, but I'm getting your name pronounced correctly, sir, right?
[00:39:07.131 --> 00:39:11.354]  Yes, you know, Mr. Jones.
[00:39:11.354 --> 00:39:13.355]  Yes.
[00:39:13.355 --> 00:39:19.740]  Well, listen, I know this is very upsetting to you, Doctor, the head of the Islamic Center for Greater Austin.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.441]  I was told this by two different
[00:39:22.222 --> 00:39:31.309]  People at TV stations who heard the first police feeds over the scanners but people are scared to go public.
[00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:36.994]  You're now the eyewitness who watched him and I know this is very hard for you to talk about.
[00:39:36.994 --> 00:39:42.438]  What is it like for you to know that the media and the police are covering this up?
[00:39:42.438 --> 00:39:44.320]  That's what makes me really sad.
[00:39:45.103 --> 00:39:46.064]  It makes me very sad.
[00:39:46.064 --> 00:39:50.028]  This man, he is really very honorable, very good man.
[00:39:50.028 --> 00:39:52.190]  And I heard about him from some other places.
[00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.992]  I heard about him from friends.
[00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:55.654]  I heard about him from students.
[00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:57.756]  He taught some students here we have.
[00:39:57.756 --> 00:40:03.942]  And when I heard about him, and then I watched him on Google, and it was really, he's a good man.
[00:40:03.942 --> 00:40:07.106]  He tried to help the children, nothing else but children.
[00:40:07.816 --> 00:40:09.858]  He's a person against the war.
[00:40:09.858 --> 00:40:11.100]  He's not with the war.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.522]  He's not supporting any terrorist organization.
[00:40:13.522 --> 00:40:14.583]  I saw his family.
[00:40:14.583 --> 00:40:16.165]  For the first time, I meet his family.
[00:40:16.165 --> 00:40:17.426]  I met his kids.
[00:40:17.426 --> 00:40:21.030]  It's so sad for somebody to lose their father like this.
[00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.673]  And I saw his son.
[00:40:23.673 --> 00:40:26.796]  When he was crying, I put myself in that place.
[00:40:26.796 --> 00:40:28.958]  I am also a peace activist.
[00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:29.959]  And I say, you know what?
[00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:30.360]  I am next.
[00:40:31.036 --> 00:40:33.418]  I was death-threatened last night.
[00:40:33.418 --> 00:40:36.721]  I don't really like talking about it because it upsets my wife.
[00:40:36.721 --> 00:40:37.682]  It only makes me commit more.
[00:41:00.538 --> 00:41:00.778]  Uh-oh.
[00:41:00.778 --> 00:41:01.339]  That is the sign.
[00:41:01.339 --> 00:41:02.560]  You know, by the way, for your information,
[00:41:16.208 --> 00:41:20.893]  Islamically, it's prohibited to kill yourself.
[00:41:20.893 --> 00:41:23.957]  We as Muslims, we're looking for a paradise.
[00:41:23.957 --> 00:41:31.885]  And when we kill ourselves, in the Quran it says, whoever kills himself, he will have an eternal life in hellfire.
[00:41:31.885 --> 00:41:35.209]  So there is no way for any Muslim to think about killing himself.
[00:41:36.361 --> 00:41:39.382]  You know, I really don't believe that at all.
[00:41:39.382 --> 00:41:44.963]  You know, someone, he has four master degrees, he's pursuing for his PhD.
[00:41:44.963 --> 00:41:48.744]  Why someone working for a PhD to go and kill himself?
[00:41:48.744 --> 00:41:52.986]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:41:52.986 --> 00:41:54.446]  It's really a disaster.
[00:41:54.446 --> 00:41:56.787]  Believe me, believe me, I'm afraid myself.
[00:41:56.787 --> 00:42:01.048]  That's the whole point of this murder.
[00:42:01.048 --> 00:42:04.109]  And then their arrogant cover-up, like we're so stupid we won't see through it.
[00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.829]  Now, I want to go back.
[00:42:06.132 --> 00:42:07.653]  Who brought you the body?
[00:42:07.653 --> 00:42:12.437]  How many days after he had been taken, or was it the same day after he had been taken out of the water?
[00:42:12.437 --> 00:42:14.918]  They'll try to spin it and claim they've done an autopsy.
[00:42:14.918 --> 00:42:17.080]  Had they done an autopsy?
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.163]  I mean, please tell us about the chain of custody of Mr. Riad's body.
[00:42:23.783 --> 00:42:27.285]  Mr. Jones, the autopsy is not like this.
[00:42:27.285 --> 00:42:29.207]  I am in the field of science, too.
[00:42:29.207 --> 00:42:34.390]  And when you take an autopsy for somebody, at least you cover it back.
[00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.351]  You take some certain area.
[00:42:36.351 --> 00:42:36.812]  I understand.
[00:42:36.812 --> 00:42:38.033]  You sew them back up.
[00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:39.834]  You don't bash the brain in.
[00:42:39.834 --> 00:42:42.956]  You don't cut the body open in all those places.
[00:42:42.956 --> 00:42:43.316]  I understand.
[00:42:43.316 --> 00:42:45.017]  I want to be clear on record.
[00:42:45.017 --> 00:42:46.838]  What day he was taken out of the water?
[00:42:46.838 --> 00:42:48.259]  What day you got him?
[00:42:48.259 --> 00:42:50.681]  We got him Friday, 11 o'clock a.m.
[00:42:52.446 --> 00:42:59.417]  Friday, and I think I heard that he was taken from the water on Saturday, but we got him in the mosque here in the Islamic Center.
[00:42:59.417 --> 00:43:02.401]  We took him on Friday and I received him at 11 o'clock.
[00:43:02.401 --> 00:43:07.129]  Okay, so to be clear, you got him less than 24 hours later, and they had not done an autopsy?
[00:43:08.288 --> 00:43:12.010]  No, he was, you know, I took him after the autopsy.
[00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.011]  I took him here and I watched him after the autopsy.
[00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:21.275]  Okay, great, but these cuts and the bashed in head were not indicative of an autopsy because they'll try to spin this.
[00:43:21.275 --> 00:43:23.536]  Describe specifically, sir, what you saw.
[00:43:23.536 --> 00:43:35.983]  I saw a cut, they cut him from the right shoulder to the stomach exactly, and the left shoulder to the stomach, from the stomach all the way to the bladder.
[00:43:37.029 --> 00:43:40.191]  And his head, his skull is completely open.
[00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:47.776]  And his left arm, also from the wrist, all the way to the top to the half of his arm, it was open.
[00:43:47.776 --> 00:43:49.157]  And big, big cuts.
[00:43:49.157 --> 00:43:52.159]  You know, just like cutting the whole body in reality.
[00:43:52.159 --> 00:43:56.142]  Okay, did it look surgical or was it... No, it doesn't.
[00:43:56.142 --> 00:43:57.263]  Okay, so it was jagged wounds?
[00:43:59.022 --> 00:44:00.563]  What is that, I'm sorry?
[00:44:00.563 --> 00:44:03.244]  Were the cuts in straight lines, or were they jagged?
[00:44:03.244 --> 00:44:04.644]  No, no, it is a straight line.
[00:44:04.644 --> 00:44:09.446]  It is a straight line, exactly, but it is not normal cut.
[00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:10.526]  Like, I have a surgery.
[00:44:10.526 --> 00:44:13.667]  I have a kidney surgery, and I can tell the difference.
[00:44:13.667 --> 00:44:14.648]  No, no, I understand.
[00:44:14.648 --> 00:44:15.548]  I understand.
[00:44:15.548 --> 00:44:23.311]  I mean, did you call him and say, be specific, this was not then from the autopsy.
[00:44:23.311 --> 00:44:24.371]  What else did you see on his body?
[00:44:25.796 --> 00:44:28.358]  Uh, I saw his hand.
[00:44:28.358 --> 00:44:29.860]  It is very dark.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.541]  Just like, uh, very dark.
[00:44:31.541 --> 00:44:34.924]  Just like, like, uh, I mean, very black.
[00:44:34.924 --> 00:44:38.367]  I saw his, um, uh, his head.
[00:44:38.367 --> 00:44:44.092]  Part of his head is not like a, a part shaved and part is not shaved.
[00:44:44.092 --> 00:44:50.078]  Uh, I saw in the body also, uh, his bruises in the face I saw also.
[00:44:50.078 --> 00:44:50.238]  Yeah.
[00:44:53.149 --> 00:45:00.375]  And there are other witnesses to this, but you said they were so... It was so horrible that they panicked and ran out of the room?
[00:45:00.375 --> 00:45:02.217]  Yeah, believe me, they cannot wash him with me.
[00:45:02.217 --> 00:45:08.882]  I have to bring some other people to help me to wash him, because the blood coming out, and we have to stop the blood.
[00:45:08.882 --> 00:45:15.608]  And we have no other choice just to have like iron tape and seal those cuts.
[00:45:16.289 --> 00:45:20.812]  And it's very, very, very, very, very hard for us to do this.
[00:45:20.812 --> 00:45:23.453]  I never saw something like this in my life, to be honest with you.
[00:45:23.453 --> 00:45:26.275]  And you said his eyes were coming out of his head?
[00:45:26.275 --> 00:45:37.842]  His eyes dropped down, and I didn't open his eyes because it was like some sticker, like a glue on it or something like that.
[00:45:37.842 --> 00:45:39.022]  Unbelievable.
[00:45:39.022 --> 00:45:45.106]  Now the media, the media... Until Friday, until today, I cannot even forget what I saw.
[00:45:46.104 --> 00:45:48.386]  It's something very, very, very hard.
[00:45:48.386 --> 00:45:51.328]  Very hard.
[00:45:51.328 --> 00:45:55.972]  Now you say that his head was, was it cut open or bashed open?
[00:45:55.972 --> 00:45:56.932]  Oh, it's open!
[00:45:56.932 --> 00:46:03.497]  It's cut all the way, the skull cut with just like a saw and empty everything, like no brain, no nothing inside.
[00:46:03.497 --> 00:46:05.319]  In the head, only the skull.
[00:46:05.319 --> 00:46:07.120]  A skull with the hair.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.841]  That's all what I saw.
[00:46:08.841 --> 00:46:13.325]  That sounds like a cover-up, like they may have shot him in the head or something and taken the brain.
[00:46:13.325 --> 00:46:13.645]  This is
[00:46:15.083 --> 00:46:17.224]  Have you called the police and called for an investigation?
[00:46:17.224 --> 00:46:19.004]  What have they said to you?
[00:46:19.004 --> 00:46:27.887]  We are actually having a committee right now from the Islamic Center, and we're going to... because we're going to just fight for this.
[00:46:27.887 --> 00:46:30.408]  We're not going to keep quiet as a Muslim community.
[00:46:30.408 --> 00:46:38.270]  We are doing a committee right now, and this committee, we're going to just call the police, call the FBI, call the hospital, hook up them like this, lift them like this.
[00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:41.311]  But this is not... it is against our religion 100% what we saw.
[00:46:43.579 --> 00:46:45.901]  We cannot do something like this to any person.
[00:46:45.901 --> 00:46:48.383]  It is a barbaric act.
[00:46:48.383 --> 00:46:49.523]  That's what I saw exactly.
[00:46:49.523 --> 00:46:50.584]  It's a barbaric act.
[00:46:50.584 --> 00:46:55.287]  Okay, to be clear, doctor, you believe that this was done previous to the autopsy?
[00:46:55.287 --> 00:46:58.290]  You believe he was tortured?
[00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:03.433]  I don't know that, but you never know.
[00:47:03.433 --> 00:47:03.934]  You never know.
[00:47:06.556 --> 00:47:08.838]  Well, I mean, they sew you up when they do an autopsy.
[00:47:08.838 --> 00:47:09.939]  You're saying it was all laying over?
[00:47:09.939 --> 00:47:10.499]  They did not.
[00:47:10.499 --> 00:47:11.039]  They did not.
[00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:13.701]  They left it open in a barbaric way.
[00:47:13.701 --> 00:47:17.304]  You know, honestly, honestly, just like somebody eating the body.
[00:47:17.304 --> 00:47:23.169]  It is the flesh and the... all the flesh and the blood outside the skin.
[00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:28.373]  You know, it is really... I wish I can just, like, take a picture with that.
[00:47:28.373 --> 00:47:32.877]  But they always... I mean, there's even state... Well, there's even state regulations on this.
[00:47:32.877 --> 00:47:37.341]  They're supposed to sew a body up after... Even if they're going to cremate it.
[00:47:37.341 --> 00:47:41.484]  This is... So, this is bizarre that... It is.
[00:47:41.484 --> 00:47:43.426]  Did you take any photos?
[00:47:43.426 --> 00:47:45.988]  Unfortunately, we're not allowed, economically, to do that.
[00:47:48.709 --> 00:47:57.974]  In Islamically, we cannot take a photo and show it, but I really almost, I did that just to show the proof and why they did something like this to someone of us.
[00:47:57.974 --> 00:48:04.017]  But Islamically, we cannot do something like this.
[00:48:04.017 --> 00:48:06.318]  But you have the witnesses.
[00:48:06.318 --> 00:48:10.780]  Who brought his body to you?
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.901]  Some agency, they carry him here straight.
[00:48:13.901 --> 00:48:15.002]  It's like a federal agency.
[00:48:16.357 --> 00:48:19.138]  And was it from the county medical examiner or the Austin coroner?
[00:48:19.138 --> 00:48:22.379]  I really didn't know which one of them.
[00:48:22.379 --> 00:48:28.000]  I can confirm that for you next week and I have all the information and I can call you with that, Mr. Jones.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.021]  What was it like for you after you saw what had happened to his body?
[00:48:32.021 --> 00:48:32.922]  I'm sorry?
[00:48:32.922 --> 00:48:37.403]  What was it like for you after you witnessed what his body looked like?
[00:48:37.403 --> 00:48:43.985]  Oh, you know, the witness, I never... The guy, he's another imam in another mosque here in Austin.
[00:48:43.985 --> 00:48:45.505]  When we opened the body,
[00:48:46.365 --> 00:48:50.354]  He opened his eyes and his mouth and he was like frozen.
[00:48:50.354 --> 00:48:51.116]  He was panicking.
[00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.391]  You know what it sounds like to me?
[00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:59.053]  It sounds like this is a message to you to leave him all laid open and cut open.
[00:48:59.053 --> 00:49:01.094]  I guess his guts were all hanging out in the bag?
[00:49:22.179 --> 00:49:26.361]  Believe me, Mr. Jones, I say that in my lecture, on my ceremony.
[00:49:26.361 --> 00:49:33.965]  I say this is a message for all Muslims, and whoever works against the war, for peace activists, this is a message for all of us.
[00:49:33.965 --> 00:49:36.066]  Now you say he had bruises on his face.
[00:49:36.066 --> 00:49:39.348]  Did it look like he'd been beaten?
[00:49:39.348 --> 00:49:40.789]  It looked some bruises.
[00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:45.731]  I don't know, the beating, or because of the water, or some clots.
[00:49:45.731 --> 00:49:49.213]  And I really cannot tell, because we are panicking.
[00:49:49.213 --> 00:49:51.134]  What does the family think happened to him?
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:56.362]  Unfortunately, the family is very afraid.
[00:49:56.362 --> 00:49:57.944]  All of them, no exceptions.
[00:49:57.944 --> 00:50:01.266]  I tried to speak with them, and unfortunately, you know, they are really panicked.
[00:50:01.266 --> 00:50:02.907]  They are very afraid.
[00:50:02.907 --> 00:50:10.193]  You know, Mr. Jones, what's going on to the Muslims after September 11th is a disaster.
[00:50:10.193 --> 00:50:16.638]  We are accused with anything we do, even kids playing with the water gun, their family arrested.
[00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:17.158]  Water gun!
[00:50:17.158 --> 00:50:18.279]  You know what's a water gun?
[00:50:18.279 --> 00:50:20.061]  I talk my kids to the Toys R Us.
[00:50:20.848 --> 00:50:22.629]  And my son, he want to have a water gun.
[00:50:22.629 --> 00:50:24.710]  I say, no, we're not allowed to do that.
[00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:26.871]  I say, Dad, we are American.
[00:50:26.871 --> 00:50:30.653]  And I say, yes, we are American, but we are, we are special.
[00:50:30.653 --> 00:50:32.414]  Stay there, doctor.
[00:50:32.414 --> 00:50:33.175]  Doctors, stay there.
[00:50:33.175 --> 00:50:33.875]  We've got a break.
[00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:41.999]  I want to come back and talk to Ibrahim, Dr. Ibrahim Dramali, who is our guest today.
[00:50:41.999 --> 00:50:47.923]  We're talking about the suspicious death of Raed Raiad.
[00:50:47.923 --> 00:50:48.523]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:55.900]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.522]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:50:59.522 --> 00:51:01.984]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:01.984 --> 00:51:05.006]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:05.006 --> 00:51:10.749]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:51:10.749 --> 00:51:14.652]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:53:00.353 --> 00:53:04.295]  Well, now you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with AlkaVita.
[00:53:04.295 --> 00:53:11.160]  AlkaVita is a pure elemental liquid silicon that is high in oxygen and highly alkaline to help balance our acidic lifestyles.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:17.545]  Fast food and unhealthy habits contribute to excess acid and undesirable effects that lay foundations of disease and poor health.
[00:53:17.725 --> 00:53:20.787]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away?
[00:53:20.787 --> 00:53:22.388]  Those words of wisdom are true.
[00:53:22.388 --> 00:53:30.113]  Your body heals itself when eating well, rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like corn syrup, sugar, preservatives, and other unpronounceable ingredients.
[00:53:30.113 --> 00:53:39.640]  Your body is the best pharmacy in the world, and with AlkaVita, it can help your body naturally neutralize excess body acid, and help hydrate your body, promoting the energized, healthier you.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.641]  Go to AlkaVitaHealth.com.
[00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:45.824]  That's A-L-K-A-V-I-T-A-Health.com.
[00:53:45.824 --> 00:53:46.224]  Or call 800-651-8255.
[00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:48.005]  That's 800-651-4011.
[00:54:15.258 --> 00:54:16.579]  Ibrahim Dromali is our guest.
[00:54:16.579 --> 00:54:22.802]  We're talking about Riyad Hamad.
[00:54:22.802 --> 00:54:27.604]  I mean, they always show you up, unless they're trying to cover up things.
[00:54:27.604 --> 00:54:32.966]  He had bruises on him, all sliced open, cut open, in a bag with everything hanging out.
[00:54:32.966 --> 00:54:39.710]  This is just an incredibly insulting and abusive move, whether it was from torture or an autopsy or what.
[00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:41.110]  This is a massive cover-up, sir.
[00:54:43.507 --> 00:54:44.387]  As I said, Mr. Jones, he's a Muslim.
[00:55:00.928 --> 00:55:01.128]  I don't
[00:55:16.507 --> 00:55:24.936]  Mr. Riyad, Mr. Hamad, he's a pursuant for a PhD, and he has kids and family, and he has a mission in his life.
[00:55:24.936 --> 00:55:34.385]  It doesn't make sense to anybody, regardless who is that person, Muslim, Christian, or Jew, that he will kill himself with this kind of things going on in his life.
[00:55:36.852 --> 00:55:57.354]  Overall, I said yesterday, actually, we have some friends, his friends came and visited me, and just to thank me because of what I did, and I asked him, I said, he was a religious person, and he said he's a Muslim, he's a regular Muslim, and he knows very well, killing himself, it is prohibited.
[00:56:00.259 --> 00:56:07.728]  Yeah, I've seen a lot of these murder-suicides where the authorities claim that you've committed suicide, and it's always the same M.O.
[00:56:07.728 --> 00:56:12.795]  They don't quote the family member, they don't quote the friend, they just vaguely say, yeah, he'd been upset.
[00:56:14.196 --> 00:56:19.421]  And then they kill you and make it look like that you killed yourself.
[00:56:19.421 --> 00:56:22.423]  But in this case, Gary Webb exposed CIA drug dealing.
[00:56:22.423 --> 00:56:23.544]  They shot him twice in the head.
[00:56:23.544 --> 00:56:26.627]  Then the police said, oh, it's normal to shoot yourself twice in the head.
[00:56:26.627 --> 00:56:27.527]  That's a quote.
[00:56:27.527 --> 00:56:30.390]  They said they see it all the time, which there is no known case of it.
[00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:31.971]  I actually looked it up in Criminology.
[00:56:33.672 --> 00:56:34.052]  Yeah, I think.
[00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:53.898]  And we saw a cop of the year who exposed the government bombing Oklahoma City.
[00:56:53.898 --> 00:56:58.579]  They tortured him to death, shot him twice in the back of the head, claimed it was suicide.
[00:56:58.579 --> 00:57:06.940]  Why do you think they would go so far as to then send you the body all sliced up, when that's not, by law, the coroner has a procedure.
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.561]  They're supposed to sew him back up, even if this was just the coroner.
[00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:16.742]  You know, something else, I think by the law, also, they have to take permission from the family to do that.
[00:57:17.987 --> 00:57:19.408]  That's right, you have to get permission.
[00:57:19.408 --> 00:57:24.553]  They have to have permission from the mosque because there's a religious issue he was talking about.
[00:57:24.553 --> 00:57:27.135]  Let me stop you, this is absolutely key.
[00:57:27.135 --> 00:57:33.160]  You have to get permission from the family for an autopsy, generally, and this was in less than 24 hours.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.663]  The point is, is that this is very... they would always sew him back up.
[00:57:37.606 --> 00:57:38.947]  Yeah, he was not.
[00:57:38.947 --> 00:57:40.708]  He was not, like, dead open.
[00:57:40.708 --> 00:57:43.529]  And believe it or not, it is not like a normal cut.
[00:57:43.529 --> 00:57:45.910]  It is absolutely not a normal cut.
[00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:59.277]  And it is straight, yes, but if you look at the flesh and the meat coming out of the body, you know, it's something just like things you see in an animal channel, discovering in the jungle.
[00:57:59.277 --> 00:58:00.397]  That's what I saw.
[00:58:00.397 --> 00:58:06.080]  Something in the jungle, somebody, an animal attacking another animal or an animal attacking a human being or something like that.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.502]  So he was just ripped to shreds?
[00:58:08.502 --> 00:58:11.885]  Absolutely yes, Mr. Jones.
[00:58:11.885 --> 00:58:14.648]  We're going to call you back on your cell phone because you've got to get out of your office for a moment.
[00:58:14.648 --> 00:58:15.909]  We're going to call you back right now.
[00:58:15.909 --> 00:58:17.330]  We're going to put you on hold, sir.
[00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:19.853]  Please give the network your cell phone number.
[00:58:19.853 --> 00:58:26.059]  We'll be right back with Dr. Romali in 70 seconds as we go into the second hour.
[00:58:26.059 --> 00:58:27.340]  You wanted us to investigate this?
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:29.162]  We are investigating it.
[00:58:29.162 --> 00:58:31.324]  We will continue to investigate it no matter how dangerous.
[00:58:35.728 --> 00:58:38.352]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:38.352 --> 00:58:44.561]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.561 --> 00:58:45.964]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:45.964 --> 00:58:48.788]  A new world order.
[00:58:48.788 --> 00:58:49.589]  In the near future.
[00:58:50.603 --> 00:58:53.685]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:53.685 --> 00:58:56.507]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.507 --> 00:58:59.289]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.289 --> 00:59:02.472]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:09.797]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:18.271]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.271 --> 00:59:22.132]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.132 --> 00:59:24.693]  The Old America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:24.693 --> 00:59:25.853]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:25.853 --> 00:59:26.653]  They're not after money.
[00:59:26.653 --> 00:59:27.913]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:27.913 --> 00:59:28.914]  They're after power.
[00:59:28.914 --> 00:59:30.054]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:59:41.557 --> 00:59:46.699]  You have been warned.
[00:59:46.699 --> 00:59:49.100]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:51.861]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:57.987 --> 00:59:59.748]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.748 --> 01:00:01.329]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.329 --> 01:00:02.890]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:07.073]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.073 --> 01:00:11.356]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.356 --> 01:00:13.257]  There is so much global news.
[01:00:13.257 --> 01:00:15.339]  There are so many things I want to cover.
[01:00:15.339 --> 01:00:19.882]  Just a massive transmission lined up for you today.
[01:00:22.066 --> 01:00:26.089]  Silica Stillo, raided, being set up, former DEA agent.
[01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:28.010]  We're going on a Showtime documentary.
[01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:31.653]  They even made fun of him and said he shouldn't have done the documentary about government drug dealing.
[01:00:31.653 --> 01:00:36.396]  He'll be in studio with us in an hour and a half, into the fourth hour today.
[01:00:36.396 --> 01:00:44.201]  Right now for this segment, part of the next, and I've got all this other huge news, we are joined by Ibrahim Dramali, Dr. Ibrahim Dramali.
[01:00:44.201 --> 01:00:50.085]  He is the head of the Islamic Center for Greater Austin, the largest Islamic organization here in Austin.
[01:00:51.519 --> 01:01:00.063]  He washed the body of Riyad Hamad, who was bound, gagged, thrown in the river.
[01:01:00.063 --> 01:01:01.544]  Police first reported it over scanners.
[01:01:01.544 --> 01:01:03.045]  They believed he'd been murdered.
[01:01:03.045 --> 01:01:04.085]  For a day, they said that.
[01:01:04.085 --> 01:01:10.069]  Then they put out a release that, well, they thought he bound himself and killed himself.
[01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:12.470]  And it looks like he was tortured.
[01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:20.594]  It looks like he was... That's what I got from people that were at TV stations, was that, yeah, it looked like he was in great pain, like he was cut, that he had been hurt.
[01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:26.942]  And people can try to rationalize that and say, oh well, he was bumping into rocks and things in the river.
[01:01:26.942 --> 01:01:31.384]  It's a very slow-moving, dirt-bottomed river over there.
[01:01:31.384 --> 01:01:34.485]  It's not like, you know, it moves about a mile an hour or less.
[01:01:34.485 --> 01:01:37.806]  I mean, in a day, he only moved, what, 500 yards, they were saying.
[01:01:37.806 --> 01:01:39.767]  Give you an idea of this lazy river, because it's a dam.
[01:01:39.767 --> 01:01:40.847]  It's Colorado River.
[01:01:40.847 --> 01:01:44.148]  It's dammed up for the city.
[01:01:44.148 --> 01:01:50.470]  Now they get the body, and the coroner supposedly had it, and everything's sliced, bashed open, brain's gone.
[01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:51.811]  Huge slices everywhere.
[01:01:52.759 --> 01:01:56.441]  Actually, the one in the middle.
[01:02:20.168 --> 01:02:24.873]  They put all instance and whatever inside the stomach in a plastic bag.
[01:02:24.873 --> 01:02:28.036]  And they put the plastic bag inside the body.
[01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:29.817]  Inside the stomach again.
[01:02:29.817 --> 01:02:37.144]  And the one from the shoulder, you know, where all the muscles come out of the body, completely out of the body.
[01:02:37.144 --> 01:02:43.751]  And it looks like, I don't know if you have your father, some kind of goat or animal.
[01:02:44.758 --> 01:02:49.983]  You're saying it looked like he'd been stabbed through the top of the shoulder down into the heart?
[01:03:00.666 --> 01:03:13.789]  Yeah, for those that don't know, with a large blade, what you do is you stab somebody right below the collarbone, on the front, in that opening, right above the collarbone, just straight down into the heart.
[01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:15.750]  Is that what you're saying, Doctor?
[01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.730]  You're saying an internal puncture?
[01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:18.071]  Oh my God.
[01:03:28.326 --> 01:03:28.426]  Yeah.
[01:03:58.570 --> 01:03:59.793]  Oh my God.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.641]  It is a disaster.
[01:04:11.641 --> 01:04:14.402]  I really start to cry, and I look at that.
[01:04:14.402 --> 01:04:29.449]  I didn't know the person before, and when I read the newspaper in the morning, before I know that he's coming to the mall for a walk-in, I read about him, I Googled him, and I said, oh my God, look at that.
[01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:34.091]  Anybody who works for Pete, it'll be, I said to the people, my people.
[01:04:34.091 --> 01:04:34.771]  Okay, stay there.
[01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:35.652]  Final segment, sir.
[01:04:35.652 --> 01:04:36.672]  We've got to break real fast.
[01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:38.073]  We'll be right back with you, Doctor.
[01:04:39.847 --> 01:04:46.733]  Unbelievable, and now they've got Alciada out saying that 9-11 truth works for Iran.
[01:04:46.733 --> 01:04:48.215]  The CIA is working overtime.
[01:04:50.822 --> 01:04:53.684]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:04:53.684 --> 01:04:55.245]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:04:55.245 --> 01:04:57.386]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:04:57.386 --> 01:04:59.287]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:59.287 --> 01:05:00.788]  The late great USA.

[01:05:55.271 --> 01:05:59.154]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[01:05:59.154 --> 01:06:08.840]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.243]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.

[01:06:17.065 --> 01:06:27.373]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.

[01:06:50.066 --> 01:06:58.989]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:06:58.989 --> 01:07:04.131]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:07:04.131 --> 01:07:15.255]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.

[01:07:51.809 --> 01:07:58.435]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:58.435 --> 01:08:01.418]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:06.141 --> 01:08:14.910]  Final segment with the head of the Islamic Center for Greater Austin, Ibrahim Dermali.
[01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:16.091]  Dr. Ibrahim Dermali.
[01:08:16.912 --> 01:08:31.608]  I was asking him during the break, if he tried to talk to the media, he says they have a committee together, they're gonna put out a press release, but that they've been contacted by TV stations and hadn't talked to them yet, I guess because he said, he told me during the break, is they've been not telling the truth.
[01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:38.736]  What is the truth, you know, in summation, any other key points, Doctor, and why you didn't talk to them, other media, but you talked to us?
[01:08:41.481 --> 01:08:49.047]  Mr. Jones, unfortunately, as Muslims, we have a very bad experience with the media, especially me, myself, personally.
[01:08:49.047 --> 01:08:53.850]  A lot of people attack me sometimes, and the media, they never say the truth.
[01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:58.814]  One newspaper, only one newspaper, and one radio station in Iowa say the truth.
[01:08:58.814 --> 01:09:03.077]  Somebody fight for, against the war, just like you, and he is the only one.
[01:09:03.077 --> 01:09:06.040]  And believe me, he was attacked from everyone in Iowa.
[01:09:07.361 --> 01:09:10.504]  So, I don't want to speak with them.
[01:09:10.504 --> 01:09:13.807]  Some TV stations, they try to contact me, unfortunately.
[01:09:13.807 --> 01:09:17.831]  I don't want to speak with them because they never say the truth.
[01:09:17.831 --> 01:09:19.633]  And I don't trust them at all.
[01:09:19.633 --> 01:09:24.077]  While listening to your show, I believe you really work for peace.
[01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.480]  And you want really the peace in this country.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.822]  So that's why I will have the courage to speak with you.
[01:09:30.285 --> 01:09:33.968]  Well, we do appreciate your courage, and I hadn't talked to you before.
[01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:36.110]  I didn't know that you saw this the same way.
[01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:41.976]  His body all cut up like that, which violates state regulations and law.
[01:09:41.976 --> 01:09:45.559]  His body all cut up, and you said that you believe...
[01:09:47.147 --> 01:09:50.549]  Mr. Jones, I was in two states before the attack, sir.
[01:09:50.549 --> 01:09:54.131]  I was in Florida before, I was in Iowa before.
[01:09:54.131 --> 01:10:06.017]  Before anything happened like this, something happened like this, somebody got killed, somebody had an accident, they almost could have... Hello?
[01:10:06.017 --> 01:10:06.798]  Hello?
[01:10:06.798 --> 01:10:08.499]  Yes sir, I'm here, continue.
[01:10:08.499 --> 01:10:11.520]  We just had a little cut out in our line to you.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.521]  Go ahead, please continue.
[01:10:13.479 --> 01:10:20.183]  Yeah, normally the agency, the hospitals, the police, they contact the Islamic Center before they do anything.
[01:10:20.183 --> 01:10:26.887]  They contact the Islamic Center before they even contact his family first, and they see what is the procedures to do.
[01:10:26.887 --> 01:10:37.314]  But I found out, unfortunately, the only place here in Austin, they just did whatever they want without permission from the family, or for us as a religious leader in the area.
[01:10:49.377 --> 01:11:04.085]  Well, I hope that they don't take me, torture me, tie me up, throw me in the river, and then the local coroner cut my body all up, or maybe it was cut up before, not sew me up and give me back, you know, liquefy with my guts hanging out in a bag.
[01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:06.367]  I mean, this is just hateful and vicious.
[01:11:06.907 --> 01:11:13.971]  And a vicious message to everyone, kind of like Luca Abrazi sleeps with the fishes.
[01:11:13.971 --> 01:11:18.574]  You know, Mr. Jones, we, as a Muslim community here in Austin, we are panicked.
[01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:20.575]  We are panicked, we are afraid.
[01:11:20.575 --> 01:11:27.119]  The people, every place I go now, people come to the mosque, speaking with me, I say, Dr. Birmani, we have to do something.
[01:11:27.119 --> 01:11:28.140]  I say, yes, we do.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.721]  We have to do something, that's why.
[01:11:29.721 --> 01:11:34.644]  But everybody in just, like, shock situation.
[01:11:35.453 --> 01:11:37.454]  Honestly, it is not easy for us, Mr. Jones.
[01:11:37.454 --> 01:11:40.455]  You know, something like this.
[01:11:40.455 --> 01:11:51.820]  Sir, you've certainly heard that his partner, who's the treasurer of his charity for children, who he talked to last, has said that Israelis with machine guns had been around his house.
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.821]  His neighbors told him that.
[01:11:53.821 --> 01:11:57.662]  Men with foreign accents with machine guns, who they believe were Israeli.
[01:11:57.662 --> 01:11:59.643]  And then Israel has said they will kill U.S.
[01:11:59.643 --> 01:12:00.784]  citizens inside the U.S.
[01:12:00.784 --> 01:12:01.384]  Were you aware of that?
[01:12:03.407 --> 01:12:05.588]  No, but it's not strange.
[01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:08.210]  I didn't hear it yet, but it's not strange to me.
[01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:13.612]  You know, there is a person writing about Muslims, his name is Joe Kaufman.
[01:12:13.612 --> 01:12:25.778]  This man, not every single Muslim working for Islam, especially for Palestine, especially supporting the Palestinian cause, this man is writing about them.
[01:12:26.374 --> 01:12:32.217]  Believe me, our government, they know very well this man is dangerous for America.
[01:12:32.217 --> 01:12:35.478]  Dangerous for America, and they do nothing to him.
[01:12:35.478 --> 01:12:37.619]  Absolutely nothing to him.
[01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:44.802]  Believe me, the FBI director in Iowa came to me once and he said, oh, this man, Dr. Zimmerman, is crazy.
[01:12:44.802 --> 01:12:45.603]  So what did you do?
[01:12:45.603 --> 01:12:47.664]  Anything for the crazy person.
[01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:53.266]  He is absolutely against America, and he is absolutely free.
[01:12:53.266 --> 01:12:54.427]  No one can touch him.
[01:12:55.447 --> 01:12:56.830]  And his name's Joe Kaufman.
[01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:00.297]  He has a website called American Against Hate.
[01:13:00.297 --> 01:13:04.486]  And in reality, American Poor Hate.
[01:13:04.486 --> 01:13:05.568]  Why this man is the priest?
[01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:22.557]  This man actually supporting, uh, wrote about Riyadh, an article about Riyadh, and about the Riyadh organization, he wrote an article, I checked it, I googled it this morning, and I was shocked the way he figured about Riyadh, like, like supporting Hamas, supporting terrorism, supporting this and supporting that.
[01:13:22.557 --> 01:13:28.540]  Oh, he said that, he said that Mr. Hamad was supporting terrorists when there's no evidence of that?
[01:13:29.531 --> 01:13:30.212]  Yes!
[01:13:30.212 --> 01:13:31.072]  Yes!
[01:13:31.072 --> 01:13:43.120]  I always say that, you know, you can check his site and if you Google Hamadan and... Daniel Baib, I wrote about him because Daniel Baib and Joe Kofman is in the same place.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.021]  In the same place.
[01:13:44.021 --> 01:13:49.365]  We really, as an American, we must wake up for some people like this.
[01:13:49.365 --> 01:13:52.627]  We must really take an action for something like this.
[01:13:52.627 --> 01:13:55.389]  We really have to understand who is right and who is wrong.
[01:13:56.733 --> 01:14:01.395]  Unfortunately, after September 11th, unfortunately, we condemned that.
[01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:02.756]  It is against Islam.
[01:14:02.756 --> 01:14:04.757]  Well, it was a staged event, sir.
[01:14:04.757 --> 01:14:15.082]  Yeah, and it's unimportant to still attack Muslims until today, even if you are against it, even if you condemn, even if it is against Islam, and still the people attacking us.
[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.102]  You know, Mr. Dodd, we are Americans.
[01:14:19.102 --> 01:14:24.887]  We are Americans, just like everybody else, and we must have our rights as an American.
[01:14:24.887 --> 01:14:26.349]  I understand.
[01:14:26.349 --> 01:14:30.072]  Doctor, I want to talk to you more in the days to come as this develops.
[01:14:30.072 --> 01:14:39.740]  Ibrahim Damali, Dr. Ibrahim Damali, the head of the Islamic Center of Greater Austin, austinmosque.org is the website.
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.581]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[01:14:41.581 --> 01:14:41.982]  Thank you.
[01:14:41.982 --> 01:14:43.783]  Thank you very much, sir.
[01:14:43.783 --> 01:14:44.624]  And be careful, okay?
[01:14:45.891 --> 01:14:46.211]  Thank you.
[01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:46.912]  Thank you very much.
[01:14:46.912 --> 01:14:47.753]  Yes, I will.
[01:14:47.753 --> 01:14:48.113]  Thank you.
[01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:49.834]  Bye-bye.
[01:14:49.834 --> 01:15:05.006]  Incredible, ladies and gentlemen, and, you know, last night, I don't want to get into the details, I got a very vicious death threat, and then I got up this morning, and Paul Watson said, have you seen this?
[01:15:05.006 --> 01:15:13.833]  It was a link to Wikipedia, and it wasn't the normal, I'm a drug addict, or I'm a criminal vandalization of my Wikipedia page.
[01:15:13.833 --> 01:15:14.434]  It was
[01:15:15.914 --> 01:15:20.696]  Someone trying to put something out that, you know, sounded plausible, which just happens in a lot of cases.
[01:15:20.696 --> 01:15:31.379]  Somebody who knew criminology, knew psychology, who, because I've seen a lot in cases of the same thing, where these crises escalate in the real world.
[01:15:31.379 --> 01:15:41.583]  It said, I printed it this morning, it's somewhere in my stack, it said Alex Jones, we're going to write an article about it, was fighting with his wife last night,
[01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:46.864]  And he went in the bathroom and had a gun and was threatening to kill himself.
[01:15:46.864 --> 01:15:48.965]  His wife called the police when she did.
[01:15:48.965 --> 01:15:50.826]  He escalated it and shot himself in the head.
[01:15:50.826 --> 01:15:53.088]  He's dead.
[01:15:53.088 --> 01:15:54.528]  And it was written to sound official.
[01:15:54.528 --> 01:15:55.369]  Alex Jones dead.
[01:15:55.369 --> 01:15:58.231]  We're going to find out who did it.
[01:15:58.231 --> 01:15:59.291]  Because that's terroristic.
[01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:01.092]  That's a crime.
[01:16:01.092 --> 01:16:02.873]  You can track back whose identity did it.
[01:16:02.873 --> 01:16:05.035]  They have to register on Wikipedia.
[01:16:05.035 --> 01:16:09.117]  And I think I might just litigate that.
[01:16:09.117 --> 01:16:10.398]  Because that's terroristic.
[01:16:11.812 --> 01:16:22.458]  Probably lead back to a neocon website or something, you know, that uploads the Al-Qaeda videos in the same video format with the same video overlay as the Al-Qaeda graphics.
[01:16:22.458 --> 01:16:23.138]  That's admitted.
[01:16:23.138 --> 01:16:24.259]  Mainstream news.
[01:16:24.259 --> 01:16:26.420]  They make these.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.722]  It's so sick.
[01:16:28.722 --> 01:16:30.763]  The neocons bragged that 9-11 helped them.
[01:16:30.763 --> 01:16:31.603]  The British bragged.
[01:16:31.603 --> 01:16:34.205]  The Israelis bragged it helped their police state.
[01:16:34.205 --> 01:16:35.405]  It helped launch the wars.
[01:16:35.405 --> 01:16:37.046]  They said Saddam was behind the attacks.
[01:16:37.046 --> 01:16:38.167]  They admit that's not true.
[01:16:39.725 --> 01:16:43.510]  Every time they need somebody to come out and say something, No.
[01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:45.532]  2 Al Qaeda says it.
[01:16:45.532 --> 01:16:48.095]  Here's the article on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:16:48.095 --> 01:16:51.999]  I'm asking everybody to get this out to everyone today.
[01:16:51.999 --> 01:16:55.844]  Because they are now, they've already been saying it for six months, now this is the official announcement.
[01:16:55.844 --> 01:17:00.249]  9-11 Truth works for Al Qaeda, now they're saying we work for Iran.
[01:17:00.996 --> 01:17:02.596]  And that we're terrorists.
[01:17:02.596 --> 01:17:09.658]  And they have provocateurs showing up at Ground Zero with signs saying 9-11 Truth was behind the bombing of the Recruitment Center.
[01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:12.639]  I mean, they're pulling all sorts of stunts.
[01:17:12.639 --> 01:17:21.921]  They've had the police show up and security guards at work for Silverstein and calling fake bomb threats on Luke Radowski.
[01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:23.861]  I mean, folks, we're on the front lines for you.
[01:17:26.184 --> 01:17:33.786]  And all we're asking you to do is realize that the enemy's coming after us with major propaganda offenses after 9-11 Truth because...
[01:17:34.577 --> 01:17:36.198]  A lot of bigwigs are going public.
[01:17:36.198 --> 01:17:38.020]  A lot of heavy hitters are going public.
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:46.586]  If we take sponsored terror away from the New World Order, state sponsored terror, globalist false flag terror, that's one of their main ace in the holes.
[01:17:46.586 --> 01:17:48.967]  They're going to have to just play a king of hearts or something on us.
[01:17:48.967 --> 01:17:52.910]  They need that ace of spades, because we got ace cards too.
[01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:59.635]  We got, you know, top cards as well, called the truth, and called the people, and history, and God.
[01:17:59.635 --> 01:18:00.676]  So they are desperate.
[01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:03.918]  They want to now say we're terrorists, doesn't matter how stupid it is,
[01:18:04.724 --> 01:18:07.785]  You know, they said Saddam, their CIA creation, was Al-Qaeda.
[01:18:07.785 --> 01:18:08.925]  The public is mindless.
[01:18:08.925 --> 01:18:10.085]  Not all of them now.
[01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.866]  They don't trust them as much as they did.
[01:18:11.866 --> 01:18:13.666]  This is life and death, folks.
[01:18:13.666 --> 01:18:17.287]  I think they're trying to discredit 9-11 Truth now because they're getting ready to stage something.
[01:18:17.287 --> 01:18:18.227]  This is red level.
[01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:22.948]  I said to my office last night, I said, I've never felt this much concern.
[01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:25.989]  I've never been this frosty.
[01:18:25.989 --> 01:18:26.809]  I don't know.
[01:18:26.809 --> 01:18:30.290]  We may be able to stop them launching something if we get the word out now.
[01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:31.950]  Al-Qaeda.
[01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:34.251]  Al-CIA to sock puppet Zahari.
[01:18:35.197 --> 01:18:38.982]  Claims I ran behind 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[01:18:38.982 --> 01:18:43.206]  Intelligence stooge unleashes another PR stunt on behalf of neocons.
[01:18:43.206 --> 01:18:50.355]  But Paul, I know you're, we might not make the point that AP admits, but later in the article, that they can't even prove it's real.
[01:18:50.355 --> 01:18:53.899]  It's all, they don't even, they do audio instead of video now because they get caught
[01:18:54.833 --> 01:19:04.397]  Putting, you know, making the video themselves, through voice print, through video analysis, through the graphics they lay on in the same layer as the CIA run.
[01:19:04.397 --> 01:19:11.399]  The three guys that run it are all former CIA, of course, current, and defense intel guys, and it's just so sick.
[01:19:11.399 --> 01:19:15.521]  You want to investigate 9-11, folks.
[01:19:15.521 --> 01:19:16.901]  There's some places we ought to be looking.
[01:19:16.901 --> 01:19:18.082]  That's all I can tell you right there.
[01:19:19.023 --> 01:19:19.924]  Um, Al C.I.
[01:19:19.924 --> 01:19:21.004]  ate a sock puppet.
[01:19:21.004 --> 01:19:24.226]  Zohari claims I ran behind 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:29.749]  AP says the authenticity of the two-hour audio recording couldn't be independently verified.
[01:19:29.749 --> 01:19:30.329]  Oh!
[01:19:30.329 --> 01:19:34.371]  They won't even say what website it came from, because we always track it back to the government.
[01:19:34.371 --> 01:19:36.552]  We're going to read this story by Paul Watson.
[01:19:36.552 --> 01:19:39.014]  I need you to get this out massively.
[01:19:39.014 --> 01:19:41.795]  Go completely insane with this.
[01:19:41.795 --> 01:19:44.276]  Your whole email list, every news site.
[01:19:44.276 --> 01:19:46.177]  We need to get this out now.
[01:19:46.177 --> 01:19:47.138]  This is an emergency.
[01:19:51.109 --> 01:19:52.529]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:52.529 --> 01:19:55.350]  A New World Order.
[01:19:55.350 --> 01:20:00.231]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:00.231 --> 01:20:03.092]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:03.092 --> 01:20:05.853]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:05.853 --> 01:20:09.054]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:16.356]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:24.842]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:24.842 --> 01:20:28.144]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:28.144 --> 01:20:31.286]  The old Americans are making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:31.286 --> 01:20:32.447]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:32.447 --> 01:20:33.227]  They're not after money.
[01:20:33.227 --> 01:20:34.508]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:34.508 --> 01:20:35.509]  They're after power.
[01:20:35.509 --> 01:20:36.630]  That's what Apple needs here.

[01:24:03.365 --> 01:24:05.106]  We're here live.

[01:24:09.048 --> 01:24:12.329]  Working hard to fight the New World Order.
[01:24:12.329 --> 01:24:16.430]  There's plenty of time to rest when we're all dead.
[01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:22.813]  But as for me, I'm gonna fight now while I'm alive.
[01:24:22.813 --> 01:24:24.413]  You found it.
[01:24:24.413 --> 01:24:25.294]  The tip of the spear.
[01:24:27.242 --> 01:24:29.163]  The Infowar.
[01:24:29.163 --> 01:24:32.303]  You were looking for the rebellion, the resistance?
[01:24:32.303 --> 01:24:32.763]  You're here.
[01:24:32.763 --> 01:24:40.526]  Alright, reading Paul Watson's article, which I need put out of the four winds ASAP.
[01:24:40.526 --> 01:24:46.947]  LCIA to sock puppet, Al Zahari, claims I ran behind 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[01:24:46.947 --> 01:24:52.069]  Intelligence stooge unleashes another PR stunt on behalf of neocons.
[01:24:52.069 --> 01:24:53.429]  LCIA to sock puppet,
[01:24:54.432 --> 01:25:10.376]  Al Zahari has quoted in an alleged audio tape released today, accusing Iran of being behind 9-11 conspiracy theories, another crude public relations stunt designed to generate hostile opinion towards the 9-11 truth movement, because it's threatening to collapse them.
[01:25:10.376 --> 01:25:15.118]  That's why you got liberals and others trying to co-opt the movement into socialism and the rest of it right now.
[01:25:15.118 --> 01:25:15.818]  They're going to fail too.
[01:25:16.815 --> 01:25:18.056]  It's decentralized.
[01:25:18.056 --> 01:25:19.177]  You can't centralize it.
[01:25:19.177 --> 01:25:20.117]  You can't get control of it.
[01:25:20.117 --> 01:25:21.278]  You can't stop it.
[01:25:21.278 --> 01:25:23.560]  They want to centralize 9-11 Truths so they can decapitate it.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.181]  That's an inside op.
[01:25:25.181 --> 01:25:45.335]  The tape had been promised three weeks ago by a monitoring group, Intel Center, the ones that upload fake videos, we have a link to that, who had been caught in the past putting out fake and misleading al-Qaeda material via the alleged media arm of the terrorist organization and was finally released today.
[01:25:48.973 --> 01:25:57.020]  The setup revolved around Al Zahari's responding to questions submitted by the public via the internet.
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:01.583]  But they won't say the website, the Intel Center, just magically the ones caught uploading fake videos.
[01:26:01.583 --> 01:26:05.606]  Admittedly fake, but they always magically have it.
[01:26:05.606 --> 01:26:16.455]  One of the questioners asked about the theory that was circulated in the Middle East and elsewhere that Israel was behind the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, reports the Associated Press.
[01:26:16.455 --> 01:26:17.376]  I want to stop right there.
[01:26:17.376 --> 01:26:18.437]  This is about two things.
[01:26:19.432 --> 01:26:28.961]  Saying 9-11 truth is Al-Qaeda or slash Shiite-Iranian, and that this all came from Iran, you're anti-American if you say it.
[01:26:28.961 --> 01:26:31.503]  But it's also about making Israel behind it.
[01:26:31.503 --> 01:26:39.991]  The media, for almost seven years since it happened, always, if you question the official story, said you're talking about Israel, and Israel only, and tried to tie it to anti-Semitism.
[01:26:42.259 --> 01:26:46.082]  Now, previously it was a minority that believed Israel was involved.
[01:26:46.082 --> 01:26:52.286]  Now, I'd say a larger minority believes Israel and Israel only, when Israel couldn't have acted alone.
[01:26:52.286 --> 01:26:58.071]  I have no doubt that elements of Israel weren't involved in it, just as British were involved.
[01:26:58.071 --> 01:26:59.051]  Same thing with London.
[01:26:59.051 --> 01:26:59.852]  They're all together.
[01:26:59.852 --> 01:27:02.694]  That gives none of them a free ride.
[01:27:02.694 --> 01:27:09.179]  It means they're all involved, all equally, because this is a massive government operation.
[01:27:09.179 --> 01:27:09.359]  So,
[01:27:11.994 --> 01:27:12.934]  Oh, it's just amazing.
[01:27:12.934 --> 01:27:29.380]  So now they also want to make it about that, to make it the big taboo of anti-Semitism, to shut down and to chill effect big Hollywood stars, governors, politicians, scientists, German defense ministers, Italian presidents.
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.621]  This is a panic.
[01:27:32.621 --> 01:27:34.241]  Notice they're the ones that always say that.
[01:27:34.241 --> 01:27:36.882]  They're not afraid of people thinking Israel did it.
[01:27:36.882 --> 01:27:37.602]  They could care less.
[01:27:37.602 --> 01:27:40.023]  Benjamin Netanyahu comes out and says, boy, this sure helped us.
[01:27:41.076 --> 01:27:42.657]  Wanting it to be about that.
[01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:45.179]  Their own documents say they want Israel to be attacked.
[01:27:45.179 --> 01:27:48.621]  That makes their people and psychology get even more under their control.
[01:27:48.621 --> 01:27:50.622]  This is very sophisticated.
[01:27:50.622 --> 01:27:54.724]  You gotta play chess instead of checkers, folks.
[01:27:54.724 --> 01:27:55.725]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[01:27:55.725 --> 01:27:58.146]  You've got it all figured out, some of you, don't you?
[01:27:58.146 --> 01:28:05.431]  One of the questioners asked about the theory that the... You just go to some random website and Zakari supposedly answers your questions.
[01:28:05.431 --> 01:28:06.111]  I mean, come on.
[01:28:07.074 --> 01:28:15.722]  One of the questioners asked about the theory that was circulated in the Middle East and elsewhere that Israel was behind the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, reports the Associated Press.
[01:28:15.722 --> 01:28:20.926]  Al Zohari accused Hezbollah's Al Manor television of starting the rumor.
[01:28:20.926 --> 01:28:21.267]  Oh, really?
[01:28:21.267 --> 01:28:24.549]  They just started talking about it a few years ago and I've been saying it's before the attack?
[01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:25.010]  It's me.
[01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:27.472]  It came from me, government, and you know it.
[01:28:27.472 --> 01:28:33.978]  The purpose of the lie is clear, to suggest that there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can't hurt America as
[01:28:35.436 --> 01:28:36.997]  No else did the history.
[01:28:36.997 --> 01:28:40.200]  Iranian media snapped up this lie and repeated it.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.161]  He said so.
[01:28:42.161 --> 01:28:43.603]  Now it's the Iranians.
[01:28:43.603 --> 01:28:55.352]  As anyone with even a superficial knowledge of the 9-11 truth movement can attest to, the sock puppet, Zawahiri's claims that Iran was the first to question the official 9-11 story is completely ludicrous.
[01:28:56.658 --> 01:28:57.939]  We wrote a story about that last week.
[01:28:57.939 --> 01:29:00.020]  We saw the scripting last week.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:13.266]  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's recent bumbling comments about 9-11, the date of which you cannot even accurately remember, was music to the ears of neocons who seized upon statements as fodder to debunk the 9-11 truth movement.
[01:29:13.266 --> 01:29:16.108]  Zawahiri's single-sentence retort and the
[01:29:16.963 --> 01:29:25.027]  Fact that it has been used to generate headlines that link alternative theories about 9-11 with those evil Iranians as a clear smear effort.
[01:29:25.027 --> 01:29:27.888]  That's all they can ever do is tie you to terrorists.
[01:29:27.888 --> 01:29:29.449]  Oh, you think the government's terrorist?
[01:29:29.449 --> 01:29:30.389]  You're a terrorist!
[01:29:30.389 --> 01:29:31.610]  You're with them!
[01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:33.551]  Oh, you caught cops provocateuring?
[01:29:33.551 --> 01:29:35.712]  You must be a terrorist!
[01:29:35.712 --> 01:29:36.492]  You've been caught!
[01:29:36.492 --> 01:29:37.272]  The people know!
[01:29:37.272 --> 01:29:38.173]  It's too late for you!
[01:29:40.925 --> 01:29:44.846]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:30:57.029 --> 01:31:01.852]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.

[01:31:56.284 --> 01:32:01.245]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:32:01.245 --> 01:32:04.226]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:32:04.226 --> 01:32:08.907]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:32:09.207 --> 01:32:11.189]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:17.275]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:32:17.275 --> 01:32:19.317]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:32:19.317 --> 01:32:23.661]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:32:23.661 --> 01:32:28.185]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong
[01:32:28.505 --> 01:32:29.945]  There's going to be a massive news blitz
[01:32:58.891 --> 01:33:21.492]  From about 45 after, right through to the bottom of the next hour, when former DEA agent, big contributor in the new Showtime special American Drug War, when he joins us bottom of the next hour, in about an hour, he'll be with us into the new fourth hour we're doing.
[01:33:21.492 --> 01:33:23.073]  There is just so much.
[01:33:23.073 --> 01:33:24.294]  I'm going to finish up with
[01:33:25.695 --> 01:33:38.522]  Al-Qaeda number two says 9-11 theory that it's an inside job propagated by Iran, and it's just some audio tape on a website that the Intel Center caught bringing out fake videos is put out.
[01:33:38.522 --> 01:33:40.203]  It's just, these people never end.
[01:33:40.203 --> 01:33:46.166]  I mean, they have the grandson of the head of the ADL, Adam Gadahn, out claiming he's American Al-Qaeda in videos in English to us.
[01:33:46.166 --> 01:33:51.069]  I mean... Let me see if Watson put Adam Gadahn in this article.
[01:33:51.069 --> 01:33:54.951]  I'm just now reading it, you know, because he wrote this in response to my ranting first hour.
[01:33:56.371 --> 01:33:57.552]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:33:57.552 --> 01:33:58.793]  It's so obvious.
[01:33:58.793 --> 01:34:02.195]  We're going to cover that.
[01:34:02.195 --> 01:34:05.618]  In California, certain elitists are allowed to not obey the laws.
[01:34:05.618 --> 01:34:07.459]  That's now mainstream news.
[01:34:07.459 --> 01:34:10.541]  I've got news stacked up here that is all so insane.
[01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:18.187]  I didn't even cover yesterday's insane news because we're so busy covering everything else that's going on.
[01:34:18.187 --> 01:34:18.947]  But you know what?
[01:34:18.947 --> 01:34:22.029]  In amongst all of this, we couldn't bring you this show without our sponsors.
[01:34:22.029 --> 01:34:22.770]  I want you to know that.
[01:34:24.192 --> 01:34:27.680]  And the sponsorship of this show is PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[01:34:29.409 --> 01:34:53.995]  Fifteen cents a day, you get all 18 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, hundreds of my weekly TV reports, every weekly TV report I do in studio here in Austin, my Sunday show videotaped, the fourth hour of this show and some days even more, like yesterday and today, we'll have an hour and a half, two hours of the vid cam on with the document cam, the guest cam, the cam on me, exclusive video clips, sneak peeks that'll be streamed to you, then archiving of it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:53.995 --> 01:34:56.316]  Fifteen cents a day, if you want to see the video,
[01:34:58.005 --> 01:35:00.234]  ...of the radio show and the radio show turns into a...
[01:35:00.985 --> 01:35:10.569]  Radio slash TV show in the fourth hour, and your prisonplanet.tv membership, by the way, also makes this broadcast possible, so please also think about signing up for that.
[01:35:10.569 --> 01:35:16.752]  Think about getting American Drug War, The Last White Hope, that I consulted on, and I'm in, it's showing on Showtime.
[01:35:16.752 --> 01:35:19.773]  We have it, it's not even in stores until the 24th of next month.
[01:35:19.773 --> 01:35:26.336]  We have it now, only place, discounted, out of the gates, American Drug War, three hours of extras, two-hour film.
[01:35:26.336 --> 01:35:28.297]  We have Washington, You're Fired by William Lewis,
[01:35:29.057 --> 01:35:30.759]  The new America Freedom to Fascism.
[01:35:30.759 --> 01:35:32.000]  I call it part two of that.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.401]  Unbelievably good.
[01:35:33.401 --> 01:35:34.321]  Washington, you're fired.
[01:35:34.321 --> 01:35:37.564]  Infowars.com.
[01:35:37.564 --> 01:35:48.313]  But another sponsor who makes this show possible is World War II Chemical Corps officer Marty Schachter.
[01:35:48.313 --> 01:35:50.675]  60 plus years running the family-owned business.
[01:35:50.675 --> 01:35:54.138]  He started with his father in 1947.
[01:35:54.138 --> 01:35:55.659]  He runs it now with his son and his son.
[01:35:56.859 --> 01:36:01.838]  And they were organic, so before anybody knew what that was, from the old days when they got rid of it...
[01:36:02.503 --> 01:36:06.645]  And he was a specialist in chemicals, so he knew how deadly it was, the ingredients on soap.
[01:36:06.645 --> 01:36:14.350]  So him and his dad got together and had an original soap company made out of vegetable and fruit oils.
[01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:17.631]  And it's 85% off supermarket prices.
[01:36:17.631 --> 01:36:21.854]  And so we believe in having great sponsors that actually save you money.
[01:36:21.854 --> 01:36:23.575]  My wife loves this stuff.
[01:36:23.575 --> 01:36:25.396]  The whole office loves it.
[01:36:25.396 --> 01:36:27.457]  Call and get the tote bag, the sampler bag.
[01:36:28.443 --> 01:36:29.284]  Uh, ship to you.
[01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:30.545]  It's massively discounted.
[01:36:30.545 --> 01:36:32.746]  Basically, it costs just to get you to try it.
[01:36:32.746 --> 01:36:38.410]  Uh, to find out or get a free brochure, get a free color catalog from them, or call, get a six-month year supply.
[01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:39.271]  Save 85% off.
[01:36:41.417 --> 01:36:46.300]  But the oil companies, that's right, the oil companies basically own the detergent soap companies.
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.861]  It's not really soap.
[01:36:47.861 --> 01:36:51.143]  It eats your clothes, gives you rashes, very toxic.
[01:36:51.143 --> 01:36:52.844]  Most asthma is caused by it.
[01:36:52.844 --> 01:36:54.105]  Major studies on that.
[01:36:54.105 --> 01:36:55.206]  It's toxic waste.
[01:36:55.206 --> 01:36:58.047]  It's what's left over from the oil refineries, mainly.
[01:36:58.047 --> 01:36:59.408]  And I have family that works in them, folks.
[01:36:59.408 --> 01:37:00.349]  I knew that when I was a little kid.
[01:37:00.349 --> 01:37:02.030]  They separated it all out.
[01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:03.731]  I'm gonna shut up and bring Marty up.
[01:37:03.731 --> 01:37:05.232]  Marty, folks need to give you a call.
[01:37:06.132 --> 01:37:07.072]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:37:07.072 --> 01:37:08.513]  Good to hear from you.
[01:37:08.513 --> 01:37:10.354]  Good to have you here, my friend.
[01:37:10.354 --> 01:37:12.134]  Look, look, I have you up once a month.
[01:37:12.134 --> 01:37:14.595]  I fiercely believe in your product.
[01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:16.836]  A lot of my listeners have checked you out.
[01:37:16.836 --> 01:37:18.076]  You usually read a letter from them.
[01:37:18.076 --> 01:37:19.777]  You get them every day.
[01:37:19.777 --> 01:37:23.358]  This is a type of soap you leave under your arms.
[01:37:23.358 --> 01:37:27.140]  It doesn't burn you, but it cleans you, because it's not a chemical weapon.
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.820]  Will you explain that to people?
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:33.142]  Well, in making soap, you want it to be what they call neutral.
[01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:36.615]  A pH of neutral, which is 7.
[01:37:36.615 --> 01:37:40.938]  When you get higher than that, you get into alkali, it starts burning.
[01:37:40.938 --> 01:37:47.661]  When you get below 7 and to 5 or 4 or 3, it becomes acetic and also burns.
[01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:56.385]  We try to keep the products, like the shampoo and the dish soap, as neutral, as harm-free as possible.
[01:37:56.385 --> 01:38:00.187]  And you know, let's get down to Earth.
[01:38:00.187 --> 01:38:01.228]  Today is Earth Day.
[01:38:02.242 --> 01:38:05.425]  And we want products to be made for the Earth.
[01:38:05.425 --> 01:38:07.347]  Earth-friendly soap.
[01:38:07.347 --> 01:38:09.249]  That's what we make.
[01:38:09.249 --> 01:38:19.280]  And I know that most people are tired of supporting those multi-billion chemical companies like Proctor, Colgate, Lever.
[01:38:20.091 --> 01:38:26.554]  They give you destruction, not only of the Earth, but of your clothing, skin, and wallet.
[01:38:26.554 --> 01:38:34.437]  And meanwhile, they're behind the phony environmental movement with a carbon tax on humans instead of giving people real things that really are good for the Earth.
[01:38:34.437 --> 01:38:35.217]  Exactly.
[01:38:35.217 --> 01:38:36.998]  That's what's happening out there.
[01:38:36.998 --> 01:38:39.039]  And we want people to have a choice.
[01:38:39.039 --> 01:38:39.879]  Freedom of choice.
[01:38:40.519 --> 01:38:43.380]  Choice instead of these harmful detergents.
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:53.105]  Choice of pure soap for their baby, for their shaving, for their all-purpose cleaning, for their baby, for their home, for everything that touches.
[01:38:53.105 --> 01:39:06.831]  This is the kind of product we specialize in, we promote, we market, and we appreciate going to all the Alex Jones listeners and sharing the good life with them.
[01:39:06.831 --> 01:39:08.152]  Well, you really do save 85% off
[01:39:09.719 --> 01:39:18.503]  I would imagine it's more now with all the oil costs going up for the petrochemicals people wash their hair with and put on their babies and the rest of it.
[01:39:18.503 --> 01:39:24.586]  But everybody knows that with a baby you've got to go out and get organic now or get the weaker stuff because it breaks them out and hurts them.
[01:39:24.586 --> 01:39:26.607]  It's doing the same thing to adults.
[01:39:26.607 --> 01:39:31.009]  Explain what's in your products versus what is in the big chemical company stuff.
[01:39:31.009 --> 01:39:35.952]  We basically make our products from coconut oil of the highest grade.
[01:39:36.707 --> 01:39:41.949]  Vegetable oils of the USP grade, that means United States Pure.
[01:39:41.949 --> 01:39:43.689]  We blend it together.
[01:39:43.689 --> 01:39:46.910]  We don't use perfumes which are toxic.
[01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:56.133]  We use juices from fruits, juices from coconuts, juices from oranges, juices from lemons, juices from apples.
[01:39:56.133 --> 01:40:05.156]  This is what gives it the aroma, but it rinses freely, doesn't leave any residue on the towels, or in the air, or on your skin.
[01:40:05.842 --> 01:40:09.104]  And this to us is the future of cleansing.
[01:40:09.104 --> 01:40:10.826]  We're a very small company.
[01:40:10.826 --> 01:40:12.527]  We're not a big corporation.
[01:40:12.527 --> 01:40:14.428]  We're a family partnership.
[01:40:14.428 --> 01:40:27.218]  But we have the knowledge, the expertise, and the information to share with you in our free catalog or in our miniature tote bag for you to exclusively try something that'll blow your mind.
[01:40:27.765 --> 01:40:30.007]  You've never used anything like this.
[01:40:30.007 --> 01:40:36.751]  We're the only company in the country producing products of this quality, of this cost value.
[01:40:36.751 --> 01:40:46.839]  You're not only going to use these products, you're not only going to love these products, you're going to have something in your home that you're going to really, really love.
[01:40:46.839 --> 01:40:52.903]  Now, Marty, until about five, six years ago, you were only a wholesaler to finer hospitals and hotels.
[01:40:53.803 --> 01:41:08.056]  And I've actually been in a nice hotel one time and seen some of your bar stuff, and then you got convinced by the network, by the sales manager who was a fan of your products, because he was into organic stuff, to try marketing direct.
[01:41:08.056 --> 01:41:11.639]  That's why people get your stuff so inexpensive.
[01:41:11.639 --> 01:41:14.422]  You're cutting out the middleman, you're cutting out
[01:41:15.046 --> 01:41:20.771]  The tens of billions that the big chemical companies use and all their propaganda and advertising.
[01:41:20.771 --> 01:41:22.732]  This is just high quality stuff.
[01:41:22.732 --> 01:41:26.075]  Please give the listeners your phone number twice.
[01:41:26.075 --> 01:41:27.276]  Area code 510-638-7091 or 800-340-7091.
[01:41:27.276 --> 01:41:30.819]  That's your toll free number 800-340-7091.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.485]  Or 5 Star Soap, that's 5, the number 5.
[01:41:49.646 --> 01:41:52.588]  FiveStarSoap.com, FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:41:52.588 --> 01:41:58.231]  We have a big banner on JonesReport.com, a banner on Infowars.com.
[01:41:58.231 --> 01:42:02.093]  You cannot miss the Calvin Pure Soap.
[01:42:02.093 --> 01:42:05.175]  CalvinPureSoap.com or FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:42:05.175 --> 01:42:06.716]  Go there, check it out.
[01:42:06.716 --> 01:42:08.277]  And it also hurts the New World Order.
[01:42:08.277 --> 01:42:09.678]  I mean, everything they do is a fraud.
[01:42:09.678 --> 01:42:15.761]  They take real soap away, make it a chemical byproduct that makes you sick, dries your skin out, hurts you.
[01:42:18.331 --> 01:42:20.411]  I mean, it's everything they do.
[01:42:20.411 --> 01:42:23.272]  You can go back to what they had before.
[01:42:23.272 --> 01:42:29.433]  I mean, just wait until you get one of these bar soaps and smell the almond and cherry essence that's in it.
[01:42:29.433 --> 01:42:30.354]  Give them the number again.
[01:42:30.354 --> 01:42:31.234]  800-340-7091.
[01:42:31.234 --> 01:42:31.574]  That's 4-1-800-340-7091.
[01:42:41.994 --> 01:42:44.338]  We have three lines for you to get into us.
[01:42:44.338 --> 01:42:46.581]  If it's busy, please call back.
[01:42:46.581 --> 01:42:48.063]  We want to hear from you.
[01:42:48.063 --> 01:42:53.171]  If you've got any kind of cleaning problem, let us take care of it for you.
[01:42:53.171 --> 01:42:54.513]  We're here for you.
[01:42:54.513 --> 01:42:56.055]  We're here for Alex.
[01:42:56.055 --> 01:42:57.257]  We're here for quality.
[01:42:57.817 --> 01:43:00.358]  Low cost and safety.
[01:43:00.358 --> 01:43:05.340]  Now, you're in Oakland, California, where you've been since 1947.
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:06.841]  How late are you open?
[01:43:06.841 --> 01:43:10.603]  What would that be like, 4.30, 5 o'clock Pacific?
[01:43:10.603 --> 01:43:13.784]  A line is open 24 hours, 24-7.
[01:43:13.784 --> 01:43:15.985]  If we miss your call, we'll call you back.
[01:43:15.985 --> 01:43:16.805]  No problem.
[01:43:16.805 --> 01:43:18.326]  Call us anytime.
[01:43:18.326 --> 01:43:22.728]  You could use the web anytime to get contact with us.
[01:43:22.728 --> 01:43:24.809]  We anxiously await to hear from you.
[01:43:25.706 --> 01:43:27.187]  Well, changing our lifestyle.
[01:43:27.187 --> 01:43:31.131]  You know, I know cell phones are bad for me, so I have cut back probably 95-97%.
[01:43:31.131 --> 01:43:41.501]  I just use it to listen to messages now, and I've even kind of gotten out of that habit, so there's like 30 messages on there right now, but I know it gives you brain tumors, so I've almost completely stopped, and so has my wife.
[01:43:41.501 --> 01:43:45.645]  It took a year or so to train myself to get off of it, because I had habitualized it,
[01:43:46.808 --> 01:43:50.010]  We've totally gotten away from anything that isn't organic in the house now.
[01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:57.415]  95% of the food we eat, every once in a while we eat out, maybe once a week, twice a month.
[01:43:57.415 --> 01:44:00.196]  I mean, sometimes we don't eat out even that much.
[01:44:00.196 --> 01:44:03.839]  We're cutting all the non-organic food out of our thing.
[01:44:03.839 --> 01:44:05.960]  I mean, it just takes making the decision
[01:44:06.821 --> 01:44:09.823]  And you also take the money away from the New World Order.
[01:44:09.823 --> 01:44:13.524]  You know, stop taking the local paper that's filled with New World Order propaganda.
[01:44:13.524 --> 01:44:27.131]  You know, we change the way we live one step at a time, and you do that by... And by the way, we still go to Central Market and Whole Foods, the big, quote, organic grocery stores here in town, where about half of it's really organic at Central Market.
[01:44:27.131 --> 01:44:33.054]  And the organics are three, four, five times, sometimes, five times, usually about twice, what the toxic
[01:44:34.423 --> 01:44:35.904]  Uh, detergents are.
[01:44:35.904 --> 01:44:38.926]  That they don't sell at Whole Foods.
[01:44:38.926 --> 01:44:39.866]  With Marty, it's different.
[01:44:39.866 --> 01:44:42.588]  It's 85% off organic.
[01:44:42.588 --> 01:44:45.149]  So you usually pay a premium for organic.
[01:44:45.149 --> 01:44:46.250]  Not with Marty.
[01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:54.254]  That is, I think, a key selling point that you don't make, uh, and that I don't make the point enough, Marty.
[01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:55.375]  Is that, is that
[01:44:56.175 --> 01:45:00.922]  You are less than the toxic stuff and a lot less than the mainline organic.
[01:45:00.922 --> 01:45:01.823]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:45:01.823 --> 01:45:07.471]  Yes, well we eliminated the middleman, we eliminated the broker, we eliminated the distributor.
[01:45:07.471 --> 01:45:12.519]  We go directly by United Parcel at the lowest contract rate.
[01:45:13.019 --> 01:45:17.081]  All this adds up to savings for the consumer.
[01:45:17.081 --> 01:45:19.923]  Savings for Alex Jones listeners.
[01:45:19.923 --> 01:45:21.223]  That's our goal.
[01:45:21.223 --> 01:45:22.384]  5starsoap.com.
[01:45:22.384 --> 01:45:24.765]  Give me a limerick there, Marty.
[01:45:24.765 --> 01:45:28.767]  Yes, I have one, but this is by popular demand.
[01:45:28.767 --> 01:45:31.949]  I have to repeat this, plus it's new encore.
[01:45:31.949 --> 01:45:33.950]  It goes like this.
[01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:41.494]  There was an old man of Nantucket who kept all his cash in a bucket, but his daughter named Nan.
[01:45:42.395 --> 01:45:44.257]  Ran away with a man.
[01:45:44.257 --> 01:45:48.320]  And as for the bucket, Man Tucket.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:55.245]  Pa followed the pair to Pa Tucket, the man and the girl and the bucket.
[01:45:55.245 --> 01:46:02.111]  And he said to the man, you're welcome to man, but as for the bucket, Pa Tucket.
[01:46:02.111 --> 01:46:08.316]  Then the pair followed Pa to Manhasset, where he still held the cash as an asset.
[01:46:11.103 --> 01:46:17.325]  Unbelievable.
[01:46:17.325 --> 01:46:19.086]  Marty Schachter, good to hear from you.
[01:46:19.086 --> 01:46:20.106]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:46:20.106 --> 01:46:20.966]  Talk to you soon.
[01:46:20.966 --> 01:46:22.307]  You bet, my friend.
[01:46:22.307 --> 01:46:23.927]  Just unbelievable.
[01:46:23.927 --> 01:46:26.508]  Marty is so funny.
[01:46:26.508 --> 01:46:34.111]  Okay, back to the really, really serious news here that I have in front of me.
[01:46:35.509 --> 01:46:39.511]  For those who don't know, I want to make this point again, and I think Paul needs to add this.
[01:46:39.511 --> 01:46:41.952]  I don't expect him to whip everything up.
[01:46:41.952 --> 01:46:45.414]  And he does cover some of it, but there's just so many points, so many frauds, so many lies.
[01:46:45.414 --> 01:46:47.495]  I don't know how he could cover it all.
[01:46:47.495 --> 01:46:51.977]  They are now putting out a talking point for six months that 9-11 Truth works for Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:51.977 --> 01:47:02.283]  Now they've had Al-Qaeda and another fake tape released by the Intel Center come out and... I mean, they don't even... The AP admits in the bottom of the article that, oh well, it's not been proven.
[01:47:02.283 --> 01:47:03.403]  We don't even know where it came from.
[01:47:03.403 --> 01:47:04.524]  I mean, I could...
[01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:10.975]  Talk in Arabic, you know, learn the lines and read it onto the web and they'd come out and say it was true.
[01:47:10.975 --> 01:47:15.298]  I mean, how many ADL grandson heads do we have to have threatening us with turbans on their heads?
[01:47:15.298 --> 01:47:19.641]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:47:19.641 --> 01:47:21.002]  It's just so arrogant.
[01:47:21.002 --> 01:47:25.705]  It's so much bravado.
[01:47:25.705 --> 01:47:28.307]  And I read a bunch of this article earlier, but finishing it up,
[01:47:32.754 --> 01:47:39.495]  With Al-CIA to sock puppet Zawahiri claims Iran behind 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[01:47:39.495 --> 01:47:51.698]  One of the questions asked about the theory was circulated in the Middle East and elsewhere that Israel was behind the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, reports the Associated Press, admitting they don't know if it's him.
[01:47:51.698 --> 01:47:52.178]  They never do.
[01:47:52.178 --> 01:47:53.398]  It's always the same thing.
[01:47:53.398 --> 01:47:56.239]  Al-Zahari accused Hezbollah's Al Manor television
[01:47:57.432 --> 01:47:58.192]  Okay, so it started here.
[01:47:58.192 --> 01:48:00.754]  If it started anywhere, it started here on this show.
[01:48:00.754 --> 01:48:03.896]  The purposes of this lie is clear to suggest that there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can hurt America.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:25.702]  As no one else did in history, Iran media snapped up this lie and repeated it, he said.
[01:48:25.702 --> 01:48:31.104]  Again, that's Saudi Arabian propaganda in league with the neocons attacking their enemy, Iran.
[01:48:31.104 --> 01:48:32.664]  It's Israeli propaganda.
[01:48:32.664 --> 01:48:35.145]  Israel has been caught creating fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[01:48:35.145 --> 01:48:36.946]  Source, Harat Jerusalem Post.
[01:48:36.946 --> 01:48:38.026]  Let's add those links in there.
[01:48:40.046 --> 01:48:51.694]  As anyone with even a superficial knowledge of the 9-11 Truth Movement can attest to, the sock-puppet Zahari's claim that Iran were the first to question the official 9-11 story is completely ludicrous.
[01:48:51.694 --> 01:49:00.620]  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's recent bumbling comments about 9-11, the date of which was three years off, he cannot even accurately remember.
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:06.264]  Where music to the ears of neocons have seized upon statements as fodder to debunk 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:49:06.264 --> 01:49:08.085]  Zalahiri's single-sentence retort
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:14.766]  At the fact that it has been used... Why are we even agreeing at Zawahiri, Paul?
[01:49:14.766 --> 01:49:16.247]  I mean, it's another fake tape.
[01:49:16.247 --> 01:49:19.170]  We know the guy's an operative, but we don't even know if this is him.
[01:49:19.170 --> 01:49:33.643]  Zawahiri's single-sentence retort, and the fact that it has been used to generate headlines that link alternative theories to 9-11 with those evil Iranians, is a clear smear effort, is highly suspicious considering the history of these al-Qaeda types and Zawahiri's background.
[01:49:35.237 --> 01:49:45.625]  Is the neocon-friendly al-Zahiri a different person to the real al-Zahiri who was reported to have been captured in Tehran in February of 2002?
[01:49:45.625 --> 01:49:51.990]  Is it a different al-Zahiri, and he gets into it, to the one reportedly captured near the Pakistan-Afghan border in September 2004?
[01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:54.412]  We have links to all these reports.
[01:49:54.412 --> 01:49:57.374]  They never retract how they kill him or capture him.
[01:49:57.374 --> 01:49:58.515]  It's truly the Goldstein.
[01:49:59.139 --> 01:50:00.540]  Of 1984.
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:07.004]  Or is it the same al-Zahiri who, at the end of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, fought for the CIA in Bosnia?
[01:50:07.004 --> 01:50:08.065]  Is that the one?
[01:50:08.065 --> 01:50:10.727]  The real CIA operative, al-Zahiri?
[01:50:10.727 --> 01:50:13.929]  Is this the same al-Zahiri who, according to a January 2000 U.S.
[01:50:13.929 --> 01:50:15.570]  congressional testimony, was granted U.S.
[01:50:15.570 --> 01:50:21.154]  residence by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, something almost impossible for many legitimate immigrants to obtain?
[01:50:21.954 --> 01:50:28.825]  Is this the same Al-Zahiri whose brother Zameen is running terrorist camps under NATO protection in the U.S.
[01:50:28.825 --> 01:50:30.788]  zone in Kosovo?
[01:50:30.788 --> 01:50:32.871]  Oh!
[01:50:32.871 --> 01:50:36.797]  Is this the same Al-Zahiri who works with the grandson of the ADL head, Adam Gadon?
[01:50:37.592 --> 01:50:39.373]  It is the same Al Zahiri.
[01:50:39.373 --> 01:50:44.795]  Previous tapes which feature a man, Al Zahiri, were found to be cobbled together from older footage.
[01:50:44.795 --> 01:50:51.017]  But that doesn't bother the lapdog media who versed in manufacturing consent and never offering retractions.
[01:50:51.017 --> 01:50:52.958]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:50:52.958 --> 01:50:56.579]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:56.579 --> 01:50:58.380]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.061]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:02.061 --> 01:51:07.802]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:07.802 --> 01:51:12.043]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:51:12.043 --> 01:51:17.244]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:53:02.203 --> 01:53:05.825]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?

[01:54:34.403 --> 01:54:37.124]  This show.
[01:54:37.124 --> 01:54:42.145]  Number one in the field of unlocking minds.
[01:54:42.145 --> 01:54:43.906]  So many people's minds we've unlocked.
[01:54:44.697 --> 01:54:53.103]  Get locked again and get caught in little subgroups who say it's all the Catholics or it's all the Jews or it's all the Reptoids.
[01:54:53.103 --> 01:55:03.952]  They accuse me of not exposing the Pope as we write articles exposing how he's a New World Order and then they post in our comments where we give them free speech that I'm covering up when I'm posting it.
[01:55:03.952 --> 01:55:13.639]  Or they say we don't expose Israel as I expose what's probably Israeli hit teams killing people in Austin and wrote the book on exposing inside job attacks.
[01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:17.628]  And it isn't that it bothers me that you attack me out there.
[01:55:17.628 --> 01:55:20.029]  It bothers me that you're not doing good work.
[01:55:20.029 --> 01:55:21.549]  You're not waking other people up.
[01:55:21.549 --> 01:55:26.650]  You're spending most of your time ninnying and attacking people in the movement.
[01:55:26.650 --> 01:55:44.573]  If someone doesn't want to have a site with pictures of Jews with big noses, with Nazi paintings from World War II, because they don't hate Jews, and because they also know that that turns people against us, then don't be mad at us that we haven't joined your little hate movement controlled by Mossad.
[01:55:45.396 --> 01:55:48.557]  Which is meant to make anybody criticizing Israel look stupid.
[01:55:48.557 --> 01:55:53.519]  Get a little more sophisticated.
[01:55:53.519 --> 01:55:56.340]  And the same thing goes for the hate the Catholics crowd.
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:57.641]  All of them.
[01:55:57.641 --> 01:55:58.621]  You are wrong.
[01:55:58.621 --> 01:55:59.961]  I am for real.
[01:55:59.961 --> 01:56:06.544]  I have woken up tens of millions of people with my listeners help because they have taken action and they have gotten involved.
[01:56:09.235 --> 01:56:13.336]  So all of you, stop ninnying, stop infighting, stop responding to it.
[01:56:13.336 --> 01:56:14.156]  Move forward!
[01:56:14.156 --> 01:56:19.097]  Why do you think we are changing under attack from Ireland to New York to Austin, Texas?
[01:56:19.097 --> 01:56:21.258]  Why do you think I'm getting death threats?
[01:56:21.258 --> 01:56:22.738]  Why do you think I've been physically attacked?
[01:56:22.738 --> 01:56:26.199]  Why do you think I've gone through all manner of stuff you can't imagine?
[01:56:26.199 --> 01:56:27.999]  Because we're having an effect!
[01:56:27.999 --> 01:56:36.321]  We now have the Pentagon having their operatives put out audio tapes claiming that 9-11 Truth's getting orders from Ahmedinejad.
[01:56:37.759 --> 01:56:43.001]  They are panicking!
[01:56:43.001 --> 01:56:44.442]  They are scared!
[01:56:44.442 --> 01:56:48.183]  They carried out the attacks and the New World Order knows we know now.
[01:56:48.183 --> 01:56:51.305]  So they're desperately going to try to make it just about Israel.
[01:56:51.305 --> 01:56:55.426]  Whether you think Israel did it or not, and there's no doubt Israel's involved, but the whole New World Order is.
[01:56:55.426 --> 01:56:57.667]  I just want to say it's bigger than that.
[01:56:57.667 --> 01:56:59.308]  Doesn't absolve them.
[01:56:59.308 --> 01:57:02.329]  If you've got five guys robbing a bank, they're all five just as guilty.
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:11.481]  But they know that people are scared to talk about Israel, scared to criticize it, so they want to tag the movement anti-semitic.
[01:57:11.481 --> 01:57:13.322]  One of the few things that can beat us.
[01:57:13.322 --> 01:57:15.242]  Do you want them to get away with the terror?
[01:57:15.242 --> 01:57:18.283]  Then get more sophisticated right now.
[01:57:18.283 --> 01:57:19.903]  Don't take the bait, fools!
[01:57:19.903 --> 01:57:22.063]  We want them to take our bait!
[01:57:22.063 --> 01:57:23.223]  Not the other way around!
[01:57:23.223 --> 01:57:27.964]  We want the biggest movement we can get.
[01:57:27.964 --> 01:57:31.585]  This is chess, ladies and gentlemen, but it isn't a game, it's life and death.
[01:57:31.585 --> 01:57:31.765]  Now,
[01:57:35.029 --> 01:57:37.511]  And they want to tie us to Al-Qaeda slash Iran.
[01:57:37.511 --> 01:57:39.853]  Doesn't matter if the two are opposite groups.
[01:57:39.853 --> 01:57:41.194]  That's the talking point.
[01:57:41.194 --> 01:57:44.617]  Do you understand that that is a major talking point?
[01:57:44.617 --> 01:57:50.441]  They, the enemy, has got their main guns firing at us.
[01:57:50.441 --> 01:57:51.602]  I'm under surveillance.
[01:57:51.602 --> 01:57:54.865]  Everything else you can imagine, ladies and gentlemen, I'm doing this for you.
[01:57:54.865 --> 01:57:56.206]  I'm doing this for the children.
[01:57:56.206 --> 01:57:57.787]  I'm doing this for liberty and our future.
[01:58:02.657 --> 01:58:04.658]  I put it all in God's hands.
[01:58:04.658 --> 01:58:06.258]  Get Terror Storm.
[01:58:06.258 --> 01:58:06.998]  Get Endgame.
[01:58:06.998 --> 01:58:08.519]  Get other 9-11 films.
[01:58:08.519 --> 01:58:09.299]  Make copies.
[01:58:09.299 --> 01:58:11.320]  Get them out like your life depends on it.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:14.541]  Because the future of this country and our economic life does.
[01:58:14.541 --> 01:58:20.903]  They want to unify us around the government so we'll accept giving up our liberties, giving up our pension funds.
[01:58:20.903 --> 01:58:21.923]  You're the target.
[01:58:21.923 --> 01:58:27.645]  But for them to be able to rape you, they've got to get you to rally around the flag so they can have their way with you.
[01:58:27.645 --> 01:58:28.725]  Do you understand?
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.622]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:35.622 --> 01:58:37.964]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:37.964 --> 01:58:42.749]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:42.749 --> 01:58:45.571]  A new world order.
[01:58:45.571 --> 01:58:50.076]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:50.076 --> 01:58:53.299]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.299 --> 01:58:55.461]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.087 --> 01:58:59.250]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.250 --> 01:59:06.577]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:09.606 --> 01:59:15.051]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.051 --> 01:59:18.935]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:18.935 --> 01:59:21.497]  Build a barrier to make great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:21.497 --> 01:59:22.658]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:22.658 --> 01:59:23.459]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.459 --> 01:59:24.720]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:25.721]  They're after power.
[01:59:25.721 --> 01:59:26.862]  That's what they're after these years.
[01:59:26.862 --> 01:59:31.006]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:59:31.607 --> 01:59:35.572]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:35.572 --> 01:59:36.353]  Endgame.
[01:59:36.353 --> 01:59:38.356]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:59:38.356 --> 01:59:43.542]  You have been warned.
[01:59:43.542 --> 01:59:45.945]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.945 --> 01:59:48.708]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.393 --> 02:00:00.476]  We are going in against what you could figuratively describe as the Death Star.
[02:00:00.476 --> 02:00:02.157]  We are taking direct
[02:00:16.997 --> 02:00:21.239]  Fire by the national, international batteries.
[02:00:21.239 --> 02:00:26.021]  They are saying that if you say 9-11 is an inside job, you're with Iran, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:00:26.021 --> 02:00:26.722]  Let me explain.
[02:00:26.722 --> 02:00:39.168]  The Intel Center, admittedly, has been caught by Wired Magazine, computer experts, and others putting their logo in the same video pixel upload as the supposed Al-Qaeda videos.
[02:00:40.498 --> 02:00:50.245]  To the point of where they now release them through other parties and don't put the logos on or release audiotapes and won't even say where it comes from because they've been caught.
[02:00:50.245 --> 02:00:52.206]  This is one of the final pieces.
[02:00:52.206 --> 02:01:04.575]  Not only do we know they carried out the attacks, lied to us, took us to war, the fact that they're always uploading and having the grandson of the ADL head, Adam Gadon, sit up there with a turban on his head saying, I'm gonna kill you a la Akbar.
[02:01:05.842 --> 02:01:17.969]  The fact that the government and former CIA commanders, Senior Military Psy-Op Intelligence Officer Jim Millenik, who works directly for Donald Rumsfeld, running I-Defense and the Intel Center.
[02:01:17.969 --> 02:01:24.092]  Do you understand that Rumsfeld's people directly upload these?
[02:01:24.092 --> 02:01:27.714]  Don't you understand what they did to us on 9-11?
[02:01:27.714 --> 02:01:28.995]  Aren't you mad about that?
[02:01:28.995 --> 02:01:29.535]  I just can't...
[02:01:31.477 --> 02:01:33.558]  Man, I want to get these traitors!
[02:01:33.558 --> 02:01:35.340]  I want to bring them to justice!
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:37.841]  Do they just get to sit here and do this to us?
[02:01:37.841 --> 02:01:43.365]  Paul Watson, I'm bringing you up for this segment and the next on no notice, because you wrote this article about this today.
[02:01:43.365 --> 02:01:44.325]  This is the key.
[02:01:44.325 --> 02:01:52.471]  The smoking gun is these fake videos and fake audios coming from them, where they've got their own boys making these videos.
[02:01:52.471 --> 02:01:53.992]  That proves they're behind it.
[02:01:53.992 --> 02:01:55.212]  Right there, Watson!
[02:01:55.212 --> 02:01:57.014]  It's a key nexus point!
[02:01:57.014 --> 02:01:57.634]  Go ahead!
[02:01:57.634 --> 02:02:00.556]  That's correct, Alex.
[02:02:01.326 --> 02:02:17.933]  Intel Center, who told us that this Al-Zuhairi audio tape would be released three weeks ago, were also behind the release of the last Bin Laden tape, which turned out was five years old, but they claimed that it was new.
[02:02:17.933 --> 02:02:23.435]  And of course, to judge the impact that these tapes used to have compared to now, consider the fact that
[02:02:24.159 --> 02:02:31.623]  Right before the 2004 election, Osama Bin Laden came out and basically stumped for Bush.
[02:02:31.623 --> 02:02:36.685]  Both Kerry and Bush admitted that that tape is what swung the election.
[02:02:36.685 --> 02:02:41.727]  Now, they have a somewhat different effect, but the policy still continues.
[02:02:41.727 --> 02:02:45.869]  I mean, you remember the spate of beheading videos two or three years ago.
[02:02:45.869 --> 02:02:47.550]  They suddenly stopped.
[02:02:47.550 --> 02:02:50.592]  But we still have these videos of Al-Zawahiri and
[02:02:51.622 --> 02:02:58.844]  Adam Gadahn or Adam Perlman coming out on a regular basis.
[02:02:58.844 --> 02:03:05.286]  And the Intel Center run by all these spooks are the ones uploading it?
[02:03:05.286 --> 02:03:05.986]  Let me explain.
[02:03:05.986 --> 02:03:14.188]  They're putting their Intel Center bug in the same video layer as the supposed original Al-Qaeda screed at the bottom.
[02:03:14.188 --> 02:03:16.869]  They're making them, Paul.
[02:03:16.869 --> 02:03:17.869]  That's right.
[02:03:17.869 --> 02:03:20.030]  The wired computer expert came out and
[02:03:20.839 --> 02:03:31.351]  Provided a detailed PDF analysis of that, showing that they were adding the Al-Qaeda brand logo at the same time as their own.
[02:03:31.351 --> 02:03:39.140]  And then the same expert a day later, even though he had, you know, he presented everything in technical format, reversed his position.
[02:03:39.952 --> 02:03:41.854]  Which was very suspicious to say the least.
[02:03:41.854 --> 02:03:42.754]  Well, he didn't really reverse.
[02:03:42.754 --> 02:03:52.762]  He just said, well, it's not conclusive, but it shows that we'd already at the office on big screen TVs blown this stuff up years ago and could see it the same layer.
[02:03:52.762 --> 02:03:56.345]  For those that don't work in video, you don't understand.
[02:03:56.345 --> 02:03:57.526]  It's in the same layer.
[02:03:57.526 --> 02:03:59.267]  Go ahead.
[02:03:59.267 --> 02:04:07.914]  Well, the smoking gun for us, which is when we really went big on this, you know, a couple of years ago, 18 months ago,
[02:04:08.877 --> 02:04:14.478]  ...was when they released the so-called Laughing Hijackers tape in October 2006.
[02:04:14.478 --> 02:04:33.662]  And that was the alleged hijackers Atta and Zayed Jarrah apparently attending a 2000 Bin Laden speech, but the footage was filmed by, quote, a security agency, but then released six years later as if it was new material from al-Qaeda.
[02:04:34.332 --> 02:04:38.617]  But then it turned out that it was really a TV dramatization from British television.
[02:04:38.617 --> 02:04:42.322]  We'll be right back with Paul Watson on the other side.
[02:04:42.322 --> 02:04:43.483]  Are you listening, police?
[02:04:43.483 --> 02:04:45.546]  Do you like being fed psyops?
[02:04:45.546 --> 02:04:46.407]  Or do you want the truth?
[02:04:48.433 --> 02:04:51.296]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:51.296 --> 02:04:52.857]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:04:52.857 --> 02:04:55.019]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:04:55.019 --> 02:04:56.900]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:58.402]  The Late Great USA.
[02:04:58.402 --> 02:05:00.163]  America, freedom to fascism.
[02:05:00.163 --> 02:05:07.189]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[02:05:49.059 --> 02:05:55.142]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[02:05:55.142 --> 02:06:01.085]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[02:06:01.085 --> 02:06:05.227]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[02:06:05.227 --> 02:06:10.130]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:18.895]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[02:06:48.618 --> 02:06:49.439]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:06:49.439 --> 02:06:52.742]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:06:52.742 --> 02:06:58.006]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[02:06:58.006 --> 02:07:03.751]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[02:07:03.751 --> 02:07:11.358]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[02:07:11.358 --> 02:07:16.262]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[02:07:16.875 --> 02:07:24.698]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[02:07:24.698 --> 02:07:29.800]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:30.120]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:30.180]  800-409-5633.
[02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:31.140]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:31.500]  Who am I?
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:31.680]  Nobody.
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:32.781]  Steve Schenck, Someone Who Cares.
[02:07:48.399 --> 02:07:55.503]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:55.503 --> 02:08:02.186]  Alright, I got a massive news blitz coming up here in just a moment, but finishing up, Paul, there's hundreds of points you make in the article.
[02:08:02.186 --> 02:08:03.707]  Hundreds!
[02:08:03.707 --> 02:08:11.471]  I mean, this guy commanding CIA attack forces against the Serbs, admitted that's the real Zahari.
[02:08:11.471 --> 02:08:14.972]  We've got these other guys, I mean, he's definitely a spook.
[02:08:14.972 --> 02:08:16.053]  And then now, the AP,
[02:08:17.117 --> 02:08:25.180]  Later in the article says, oh well we can't confirm this audio, it's just on the internet, but it's big national news and it will be reported as fact.
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:32.022]  And then now they already have the talking point that we're Al Qaeda and we bombed this, we bombed that in New York.
[02:08:32.022 --> 02:08:35.803]  Now we're working with Iran because we say the government's behind the terror.
[02:08:35.803 --> 02:08:41.205]  I mean, they treat the public, Paul, like they're talking to basically mentally retarded people.
[02:08:42.904 --> 02:08:47.108]  Well, yeah, because that propaganda at its base level is the most effective.
[02:08:47.108 --> 02:08:52.273]  You keep it simple, otherwise, you know, they won't understand it.
[02:08:52.273 --> 02:09:00.961]  But going back to Alza Harway, I mean, he appeared two years running before the State of the Union speech in 2006-2007.
[02:09:05.373 --> 02:09:28.719]  Attacking Bush's policy in Iraq just weeks after Dick Cheney and former Press Secretary Tony Snowe had circulated this talking point that skeptics of the occupation of Iraq and skeptics about the troop surge were al-Qaeda sympathizers, and then Al-Zawahiri pops up right before Bush's State of the Union speech and says exactly
[02:09:29.577 --> 02:09:35.160]  You know, the thing that would justify them calling for troop surge skeptics to be linked with Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:40.724]  So it jives perfectly with the neocons propaganda at every point.
[02:09:40.724 --> 02:09:52.931]  But another perspective is to say, well, if they are having to directly engage us and propagandize in these media stunts, then it shows that we're having an effect and that we have influence.
[02:09:52.931 --> 02:09:58.274]  Otherwise, they just ignore us.
[02:09:58.274 --> 02:09:58.615]  Paul,
[02:09:59.677 --> 02:10:01.238]  It's scary to know.
[02:10:01.238 --> 02:10:05.079]  I mean, this is when you really know the government did it.
[02:10:05.079 --> 02:10:25.408]  All the scientific evidence, all the lying and saying Saddam was behind it about WMDs, the troops massed around Afghanistan in the months before to invade, Bush signing the launch orders, Marvin Bush running security on the World Trade Center, his mother writing about it in her autobiography, the NORAD drills, the stand-down, the 7-7 drills, all of it.
[02:10:25.408 --> 02:10:26.669]  But when you realize that
[02:10:27.577 --> 02:10:39.219]  Former CIA and Defense Intelligence operatives in psych warfare run the websites uploading this, and that it's their logo, and they're doing it on a soundstage.
[02:10:39.219 --> 02:10:42.100]  I mean, these people are bad, man!
[02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:45.641]  That is the absolute proof right there for anybody.
[02:10:45.641 --> 02:10:51.342]  It's just disgusting what the scum that runs this government did on 9-11.
[02:10:51.342 --> 02:10:55.743]  I just can't believe they killed 3,000 of us, but I guess that's a military mindset.
[02:10:57.091 --> 02:10:58.451]  I can't believe this is my life.
[02:10:58.451 --> 02:11:00.612]  I can't believe we live with these nuts running things.
[02:11:00.612 --> 02:11:06.473]  I can't believe the public's still brainwashed and doesn't understand, Paul.
[02:11:06.473 --> 02:11:23.036]  Well, that's correct, but again, if they're having to do this, you know, directly linking 9-11 truth movement people with being sympathetic towards America's so-called enemies, then it shows that they're scared, they're frightened of us.
[02:11:23.036 --> 02:11:24.456]  What's interesting to me is that
[02:11:25.515 --> 02:11:31.163]  You know, according to John McCain, Al-Qaeda and Iran are in alliance.
[02:11:31.163 --> 02:11:34.848]  So if they're in alliance, then why is Al-Qaeda number two?
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:36.660]  Slamming Iran.
[02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:38.141]  You can't have it both ways.
[02:11:38.141 --> 02:11:48.745]  By the way, Paul, since you raised that, he kept saying in speeches in the Middle East where it was really ridiculous, you know, because they're not as dumbed down and they know their own politics and their own religious divisions.
[02:11:48.745 --> 02:11:55.248]  He would say in press conferences that, you know, Iran's with Al-Qaeda, running the Al-Qaeda attacks, and al-Sadr is Al-Qaeda.
[02:11:55.248 --> 02:12:00.370]  And then, you know, the president of Jordan, the king, others would say, no, no, you can't say that.
[02:12:00.370 --> 02:12:02.331]  Kind of like whenever Bush at the White House
[02:12:03.251 --> 02:12:10.354]  Uh, with the Unicole executive, Karzai, Mohammed Karzai, said that Iran was running Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.
[02:12:10.354 --> 02:12:16.157]  Karzai said, no, no, no, they're helping, because he was like, Mr. President, he said, this is on Afghan TV, you can't say that.
[02:12:16.157 --> 02:12:18.418]  And Bush said, no, you are wrong, they are Al-Qaeda.
[02:12:18.418 --> 02:12:20.359]  And he said, okay, yes sir, they're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:12:20.999 --> 02:12:24.521]  Because it's like saying Superman is Lex Luthor.
[02:12:24.521 --> 02:12:29.524]  I mean, it's just, it's just, that's only for the idiots that we are in this country.
[02:12:29.524 --> 02:12:31.465]  Only we will buy that.
[02:12:31.465 --> 02:12:34.927]  Foreign, it just totally discredits everybody.
[02:12:34.927 --> 02:12:43.532]  And so, you know, you raise that point, and I said on air when McCain said that, I said, McCain isn't saying this because he's senile at 70-something years old.
[02:12:43.532 --> 02:12:47.795]  McCain is saying this because this is the policy to lie.
[02:12:47.795 --> 02:12:49.896]  And then McCain, what, two weeks ago before Congress,
[02:12:50.849 --> 02:12:58.074]  In the Senate, McCain said to, when he was talking to Petraeus, he said, you know, is not Al-Qaeda Iran?
[02:12:58.074 --> 02:13:00.115]  And Petraeus said, yes, they're Al-Qaeda.
[02:13:00.115 --> 02:13:04.098]  And so see, they're lying to you folks!
[02:13:04.098 --> 02:13:06.519]  They treat you like you're idiots!
[02:13:06.519 --> 02:13:08.661]  They carried out the damn attacks!
[02:13:08.661 --> 02:13:10.202]  What is it you don't understand?
[02:13:10.202 --> 02:13:11.643]  They're killers, man!
[02:13:11.643 --> 02:13:14.825]  They're gonna kill more of us if we don't do something about them!
[02:13:15.507 --> 02:13:16.688]  I'm risking my damn life!
[02:13:16.688 --> 02:13:18.709]  Excuse me, I don't mean to get mad, I apologize.
[02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:20.330]  I'm risking my life here.
[02:13:20.330 --> 02:13:21.370]  Paul is.
[02:13:21.370 --> 02:13:23.731]  They're killing people locally in Austin now.
[02:13:23.731 --> 02:13:26.913]  This isn't a joke, Paul!
[02:13:26.913 --> 02:13:30.615]  No, it's not a joke.
[02:13:30.615 --> 02:13:36.858]  Again, the fact that they have to do this gives me hope that we are having a bigger and bigger influence.
[02:13:36.858 --> 02:13:42.101]  I mean, they've tried to... You had Geraldo Rivera try and blame the
[02:13:43.251 --> 02:13:57.803]  Bombing, I call it a bombing, it was basically a firework or something, at the Times Square Military Recruitment Center and said it was the work of 9-11 truth activists or 9-11 truth anarchists.
[02:13:57.803 --> 02:14:01.866]  So they're basically equating us with terrorists, and they have been for months.
[02:14:01.866 --> 02:14:06.950]  So this is just the next phase of that, to link us with the great enemy of Iran.
[02:14:16.956 --> 02:14:19.797]  I can't believe we're being forced to fight with these killers.
[02:14:19.797 --> 02:14:22.678]  Think about it, Paul, we're actually hurting them globally.
[02:14:22.678 --> 02:14:26.820]  People are seeing who they are, and they are mad.
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:36.364]  I want to say to all of them, and Special Ops that took part in this, and the Israelis, and the rest of them, and the people in our government, no doubt British were involved, the evidence shows, what have you become?
[02:14:37.819 --> 02:14:42.643]  Well, we know the Islamists really are a threat and we had to do this because you weren't ready to get ready to fight them.
[02:14:42.643 --> 02:14:44.025]  And then, that's a bunch of bull.
[02:14:44.025 --> 02:14:47.908]  You fund all the radical Muslims to overthrow their secular governments.
[02:14:47.908 --> 02:14:50.110]  And then you attack the innocent Serbs using them.
[02:14:51.013 --> 02:14:52.293]  You are criminals!
[02:14:52.293 --> 02:15:03.896]  It's because you want no-bid contracts in domestic police states, and contracts for your bosses to run the private contractors, and it's so you can take our pension funds and do whatever you want domestically.
[02:15:03.896 --> 02:15:06.377]  This has nothing to do with fighting Muslims.
[02:15:06.377 --> 02:15:10.838]  How dare you fall back on that and say you carried out the attacks for our own good?
[02:15:10.838 --> 02:15:12.699]  You know that's a bunch of bull, too.
[02:15:12.699 --> 02:15:14.179]  Watson?
[02:15:14.179 --> 02:15:17.880]  Well, what's interesting to me about this whole Aldo Herry thing is
[02:15:19.449 --> 02:15:26.396]  Supposedly, he was asked 2,000 questions, and this was his response to one of them.
[02:15:26.396 --> 02:15:30.360]  And his response was one sentence long.
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:37.847]  So the media have essentially picked out a one-sentence response to a question out of 2,000 questions.
[02:15:37.847 --> 02:15:40.049]  But that's classic propaganda.
[02:15:40.049 --> 02:15:42.692]  They made it very simple so it couldn't be analyzed.
[02:15:43.672 --> 02:15:51.458]  Yeah, but they've chosen to run with headlines about him equating 9-11 conspiracy theories with Iran.
[02:15:51.458 --> 02:15:55.320]  One question out of 2,000 answers that he gave.
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:15:59.143]  So they've focused in and picked this and ran with it.
[02:15:59.143 --> 02:16:05.668]  And it's obviously part of this sentiment to sour public opinion towards the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:16:07.245 --> 02:16:09.887]  Yeah, we're just completely screwed.
[02:16:09.887 --> 02:16:20.813]  We've got psychopathic killers with unlimited cash that own the banks, running everything, poisoning our water, staging terror attacks, grandsons of the ADL head popping up in turbans.
[02:16:20.813 --> 02:16:35.261]  I mean, I just... Paul Watson, tell folks about the PrisonPlanet.tv membership so we can have more capital to get the word out and expand what we're doing, and so they can also have high-quality video the fourth hour.
[02:16:37.116 --> 02:16:51.982]  Well yeah, we've just upped the service by offering live streaming, video streaming and archives which are available maximum two, three hours after the end of the show to subscribers.
[02:16:51.982 --> 02:16:59.165]  And as you said before, usually it goes on for an hour and a half, two hours, sometimes even three hours.
[02:17:01.451 --> 02:17:16.715]  I've been watching it since it started, and it's not only informative, but it's very entertaining because it's kind of a more off-the-hook approach that you've taken, throwing in a bit of humour for people, you know, while giving them the real information on top of that.
[02:17:16.715 --> 02:17:28.378]  So I think people find it very interesting on top of everything else that they get, which is every Alex Jones video in four different download formats.
[02:17:29.253 --> 02:17:40.777]  All the new videos are available in streaming flash, so you can watch it as you would watch a YouTube video live, but it's in much higher quality.
[02:17:40.777 --> 02:17:49.700]  Again, we've got Alex's book, my book, hundreds of audio interviews, hundreds more special video presentations.
[02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:52.601]  We had the JFK sneak peek last week.
[02:17:52.601 --> 02:17:57.203]  We've got scores more special presentations like that in high quality.
[02:17:58.418 --> 02:18:01.361]  And we're adding new content to it all the time.
[02:18:01.361 --> 02:18:17.234]  So, you know, to throw fire into our bellies and fund what we're doing, I think a lot of people see it as a good way to support us for what is little cost.
[02:18:17.234 --> 02:18:21.037]  Well, I just appreciate everything you're doing, Paul.
[02:18:21.037 --> 02:18:24.220]  And whatever happens in all of this, I know you're going to continue on with your work.
[02:18:25.649 --> 02:18:28.131]  Yeah, they do kill me or set me up or imprison me, folks.
[02:18:28.131 --> 02:18:34.455]  Know that you'll automatically know who all my enemies are in our own movement, because they'll all intensify their attacks on me.
[02:18:34.455 --> 02:18:39.579]  So use whatever happens to me as an identifier of the enemy.
[02:18:39.579 --> 02:18:45.383]  And I'm not saying they're gonna kill me, but I got a death threat last night, and they put up on Wikipedia that I've been killed at the same time.
[02:18:45.383 --> 02:18:52.108]  Very sick freaks, and... I mean, did you hear all that, you know, with the local Palestinian peaceful activist?
[02:18:52.108 --> 02:18:54.130]  How his body was all sliced up open,
[02:18:55.470 --> 02:19:00.153]  And signs of torture all over him, same thing I got from news sources.
[02:19:00.153 --> 02:19:10.999]  And they call it a suicide where he's all bound and... Well naturally, naturally it's a suicide if you're bound and gagged and the media unquestionably reported it as a suicide.
[02:19:10.999 --> 02:19:17.583]  Well remember Dr. David Kelly, he wrote emails to two friends saying, I've been told I'll be found dead in the woods if I don't shut up.
[02:19:17.583 --> 02:19:23.207]  And then police come up and see five guys in black uniforms run away from his body, his wrists are slit with no blood at the scene and
[02:19:23.956 --> 02:19:24.496]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:51.047 --> 02:19:52.788]  A New World Order.
[02:19:52.788 --> 02:19:57.692]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:57.692 --> 02:20:00.514]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:00.514 --> 02:20:03.316]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:20:03.316 --> 02:20:06.498]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:06.498 --> 02:20:13.824]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:22.284]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:22.284 --> 02:20:26.146]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:26.146 --> 02:20:28.728]  The Overbearing is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:28.728 --> 02:20:29.889]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:29.889 --> 02:20:30.669]  They're not after money.
[02:20:30.669 --> 02:20:31.950]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:31.950 --> 02:20:32.931]  They're after power.
[02:20:32.931 --> 02:20:34.092]  That's what happens here.

[02:22:48.021 --> 02:22:49.302]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:22:49.302 --> 02:22:51.723]  of the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:22:51.723 --> 02:22:54.765]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:22:54.765 --> 02:22:55.525]  is a real thing.
[02:22:55.525 --> 02:23:02.530]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never-before-available garlic.

[02:23:13.516 --> 02:23:13.916]  We're good to go.

[02:24:00.362 --> 02:24:06.866]  I don't think I've ever had a more important massive stack of news in front of me.
[02:24:06.866 --> 02:24:11.930]  And I haven't gotten to any of it with all the breaking stories and news and information today.
[02:24:11.930 --> 02:24:17.974]  Celica Stillo, former DEA agent, Vietnam vet sniper, police officer.
[02:24:20.402 --> 02:24:23.263]  Sniper, Vietnam vet, then a police officer, then Border Patrol.
[02:24:23.263 --> 02:24:26.184]  I mean, not Border Patrol, uh, DEA.
[02:24:26.184 --> 02:24:27.085]  He'll be joining us by the way.
[02:24:27.085 --> 02:24:29.146]  He's being set up and what's happening for an hour.
[02:24:29.146 --> 02:24:31.807]  In the last 30 minutes, I will news blitz.
[02:24:31.807 --> 02:24:33.848]  I will cover all of this.
[02:24:33.848 --> 02:24:37.389]  What's the type of news that I have here in front of me?
[02:24:37.389 --> 02:24:39.990]  I saw this on LewRockwell.com last night.
[02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:46.493]  I googled it and found articles in California defending this saying it's good.
[02:24:46.493 --> 02:24:49.414]  Now, remember what Aaron Russo said that Nick Rockefeller told him?
[02:24:50.191 --> 02:24:54.275]  We already have this in Texas and some other areas and in smaller towns.
[02:24:54.275 --> 02:24:56.176]  The police are allowed to drink and drive.
[02:24:56.176 --> 02:24:58.658]  The police are allowed to speed.
[02:24:58.658 --> 02:25:01.721]  Anyone who works for the government is basically God.
[02:25:01.721 --> 02:25:02.722]  One million people.
[02:25:02.722 --> 02:25:03.423]  This is confirmed.

[02:25:04.343 --> 02:25:06.205]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:25:06.205 --> 02:25:07.346]  Out of the way peasants.
[02:25:07.346 --> 02:25:10.629]  I want the guys to do a larger story on this.
[02:25:10.629 --> 02:25:11.910]  And tie it in with Russo's info.
[02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:15.253]  You can find it on YouTube.
[02:25:17.679 --> 02:25:21.103]  President Plata dot TV members can see it in super high quality, the whole interview.
[02:25:21.103 --> 02:25:22.344]  Out of the way peasants!
[02:25:22.344 --> 02:25:28.230]  Readers have been shocked to learn that California has about 1 million citizens who are literally above the law.
[02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:30.973]  Members, and the illegal aliens are too but they don't mention them.
[02:25:30.973 --> 02:25:31.774]  Members of this group
[02:25:32.615 --> 02:25:52.819]  As a register front page article April 6th detail, this is the register that first reported it, can drive their cars as fast as they choose, they can drink a six pack of beer at the bar and then get behind the wheel and weave their way home, they can zoom in and out of traffic, run traffic lights, roll through stop signs, and ignore school crossing zones.
[02:25:52.819 --> 02:25:54.279]  That's a tyranny always works.
[02:25:54.279 --> 02:26:02.181]  They can ride on toll roads for free, park in illegal sports spots, and drive on high occupancy vehicle lanes if they only have one passenger in their car.
[02:26:03.547 --> 02:26:05.028]  One person in the car.
[02:26:05.028 --> 02:26:08.510]  Chances are they will never have to pay a fine or get a traffic citation.
[02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:12.552]  They are a special class of people basically exempt from the laws the rest of us must follow.
[02:26:12.552 --> 02:26:15.414]  This is what Nick told them it would be like.
[02:26:15.414 --> 02:26:17.455]  This isn't a small number either.
[02:26:17.455 --> 02:26:27.621]  Drivers of 1 in 22 California cars and light trucks on the road have a special immunity which should cause our government leaders and law enforcement authorities
[02:26:28.684 --> 02:26:36.107]  Always eager to protect us from any perceived problem, or discrimination, or special privilege, to demand a fix to the real public safety threat.
[02:26:36.107 --> 02:26:38.008]  Think about this, what this means.
[02:26:38.008 --> 02:26:46.331]  A million drivers who can engage and endanger our lives with near impunity, I can hear it now, there ought to be a law.
[02:26:46.331 --> 02:26:52.374]  Yeah, like in New York, we'd have off-duty cops, this is in the new film, walk right up and just punch us, hit us in front of cops, and they all just laugh.
[02:26:53.024 --> 02:26:54.565]  They go, there's my badge!
[02:26:54.565 --> 02:26:56.345]  They pull their badge out and show it to the camera.
[02:26:56.345 --> 02:26:57.946]  I'll do whatever I want!
[02:26:57.946 --> 02:26:58.346]  Boom!
[02:26:58.346 --> 02:26:59.527]  Punch you right in the face!
[02:26:59.527 --> 02:27:00.807]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:27:00.807 --> 02:27:01.107]  Yeah!
[02:27:01.107 --> 02:27:01.888]  I mean, literally.
[02:27:01.888 --> 02:27:03.748]  Like, demons!
[02:27:03.748 --> 02:27:05.349]  Demons!
[02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:07.790]  This country is demon run, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:10.538 --> 02:27:20.386]  But instead of pursuing for a fix, most legislatures are trying to expand the program so that even more people can have the special we're-above-the-law license plates.
[02:27:20.386 --> 02:27:21.406]  What gives?
[02:27:21.406 --> 02:27:23.928]  The answer is a sickeningly obvious.
[02:27:23.928 --> 02:27:30.373]  The special people are those who work for law enforcement or other government agencies or their family members.
[02:27:30.373 --> 02:27:34.436]  And then it goes into a huge article detailing it all with mainstream media links.
[02:27:34.436 --> 02:27:36.378]  But the media in California says it's good.
[02:27:38.197 --> 02:27:41.680]  Folks, 1 in 10 is soon going to be one of these people.
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:45.763]  Well, 1 out of 2 is already government.
[02:27:45.763 --> 02:27:47.084]  It's where you can't help work for the government.
[02:27:47.084 --> 02:27:48.825]  I'm not saying everybody who works for the government is bad.
[02:27:48.825 --> 02:27:51.807]  The point is that the government controls everything.
[02:27:51.807 --> 02:27:56.010]  1 in 10 is going to be Homeland Security related.
[02:27:56.010 --> 02:27:56.791]  I was looking up the numbers.
[02:27:56.791 --> 02:28:00.073]  It's already 1 in like 16.
[02:28:00.073 --> 02:28:01.034]  Higher in some areas.
[02:28:01.823 --> 02:28:03.785]  Do you understand what this means?
[02:28:03.785 --> 02:28:22.780]  I mean, they are God, and they're all going to have the special badges and the special continuity of government and hundreds of thousands of executives in InfraGard have shoot-to-kill power and millions of truck drivers and 52,000 preachers going up from 26,000.
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:24.121]  I mean, it's over, folks.
[02:28:24.121 --> 02:28:26.863]  Just Stasi tattletales, and there's no terrorists.
[02:28:26.863 --> 02:28:28.344]  There's not a lot of real crime.
[02:28:28.344 --> 02:28:29.285]  They're going to find it!
[02:28:30.063 --> 02:28:36.466]  Supreme Court's ruled they can take your bank account, take your property with no judge, no jury, no warrant.
[02:28:36.466 --> 02:28:43.888]  Private interests are allowed to lobby government, openly pay them, to then take your property with no just compensation.
[02:28:43.888 --> 02:28:45.589]  I mean, we're not just gonna have tyranny, folks.
[02:28:45.589 --> 02:28:48.110]  This is a criminal group, and I have articles today.
[02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:49.831]  ABC News.
[02:28:49.831 --> 02:28:55.613]  Army, Marine Corps are recruiting more illegal aliens, and yes, felons.
[02:28:55.613 --> 02:28:57.974]  And then when you read, it says aggravated felons.
[02:28:59.424 --> 02:29:02.525]  And they give some ridiculously low numbers.
[02:29:02.525 --> 02:29:06.006]  In like three minutes of Google searching, I found the real numbers this morning.
[02:29:06.006 --> 02:29:12.608]  So you think the ABC News headline about, you know, Army and Marines except more felons.
[02:29:12.608 --> 02:29:14.909]  And it says rapist, manslaughter.
[02:29:14.909 --> 02:29:16.870]  Oh yeah!
[02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:18.530]  But then they just give you low numbers.
[02:29:18.530 --> 02:29:21.051]  But if you look, they gave you the last month's recruiting numbers.
[02:29:23.189 --> 02:29:27.011]  Which is in the hundreds and hundreds, but it makes it sound small.
[02:29:27.011 --> 02:29:30.692]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:29:30.692 --> 02:29:33.653]  You will be ruled by aggravated felons.
[02:29:33.653 --> 02:29:34.994]  Do you understand?
[02:29:34.994 --> 02:29:38.755]  This is your future.
[02:29:38.755 --> 02:29:40.156]  We're on the march.
[02:29:40.156 --> 02:29:42.677]  The empire's on the run.

[02:30:48.342 --> 02:30:54.186]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[02:30:54.186 --> 02:30:59.609]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:30:59.609 --> 02:31:04.993]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:31:04.993 --> 02:31:10.896]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:31:10.896 --> 02:31:15.159]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[02:31:15.359 --> 02:31:17.101]  Most people are overly acidic.
[02:31:17.101 --> 02:31:20.904]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:31:20.904 --> 02:31:25.728]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:31:25.728 --> 02:31:26.769]  Do your part.
[02:31:26.769 --> 02:31:29.391]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[02:31:48.095 --> 02:31:50.076]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:31:50.076 --> 02:31:57.038]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:31:57.038 --> 02:32:05.441]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:33:20.202 --> 02:33:24.225]  You ever love someone so much you thought your little heart was gonna break in two?
[02:33:24.225 --> 02:33:26.567]  I didn't think so.
[02:33:26.567 --> 02:33:30.391]  You ever try with all your heart and soul to get your lover back to you?
[02:33:30.391 --> 02:33:32.893]  I won't hope so.
[02:33:32.893 --> 02:33:37.577]  You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to watch her walk away?
[02:33:44.352 --> 02:33:56.333]  Yeah, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms did a bad, bad thing to Stella Costello, the third Vietnam veteran of the Army, a sniper, then he worked as a police officer, sheriff's deputy on the border.
[02:33:57.051 --> 02:34:03.272]  With the Border Patrol, then he was a DEA agent, the most highly decorated and the commander down there in Latin America.
[02:34:03.272 --> 02:34:09.174]  Witnessed cocaine dealing, shipments by our own CIA at El Opengo Air Base.
[02:34:09.174 --> 02:34:16.555]  We then interviewed the CIA folks on the other end of it, like Terry Reid of Amina, Arkansas, with Oliver North, the Clintons, the Bushes.
[02:34:16.555 --> 02:34:20.536]  All the drug dealing, all witnessed in the CIA Solicitor General.
[02:34:21.475 --> 02:34:27.578]  And their inspector testifying before Congress that they did indeed bring in the drugs.
[02:34:27.578 --> 02:34:28.459]  They still bring them in.
[02:34:28.459 --> 02:34:29.660]  The banks launder it.
[02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:32.981]  They license cartels to bring the drugs in, the majority of it.
[02:34:32.981 --> 02:34:35.823]  The government ships some in itself, but they mainly license them.
[02:34:35.823 --> 02:34:43.647]  Then they leave them alone if they launder the money properly like they are supposed to do through the big central banks.
[02:34:43.647 --> 02:34:45.568]  If they don't, they then get pinched.
[02:34:46.246 --> 02:34:46.566]  I don't know.
[02:35:00.618 --> 02:35:01.498]  And who was involved in it?
[02:35:01.498 --> 02:35:11.902]  Well, no, Oliver Stone wrote it, De Palma directed it, and I've seen the making of that, and they went down and met with the cartels, they studied how the banks launder the money, they really show it in that movie.
[02:35:11.902 --> 02:35:18.725]  So Selly got raided by the BATF, basically set up because he's been exposing government drug dealing.
[02:35:18.725 --> 02:35:21.946]  He is in the film that is on your screen.
[02:35:23.026 --> 02:35:47.221]  I forgot to tell listeners out there who are listening on the AM and FM dial and on the internet at InfoWars.com that we're going to start the video cam feed 30 minutes early in the third hour, not just the fourth hour today, but never fear, PrisonPlanet.tv members, this will be archived a few hours after the show today, and so you'll be able to go up there and watch the hour and a half interview, or hour interview, and then my news blitz at the last 20-30 minutes with Stella Costello
[02:35:47.799 --> 02:35:58.561]  Uh, the third today, and so the live video cam, the document cam, our guest cam, the cam on me, the video feed cam, we have five different feeds in here, uh, that is all live right now.
[02:35:58.561 --> 02:36:02.202]  Selly is, uh, a big part of the new film, American Drug War.
[02:36:02.202 --> 02:36:07.083]  He consulted on the film, American Drug War, that's on your screen.
[02:36:07.083 --> 02:36:17.425]  As I did, uh, I am in the, uh, extras, uh, according to my own recommendation that I not be the voiceover for this, uh, but I am in a big part of the three hours of extras that are in the film.
[02:36:18.058 --> 02:36:21.879]  And so another reason to get it from InfoWars.com.
[02:36:21.879 --> 02:36:25.719]  It isn't even available in stores yet until May 24th.
[02:36:25.719 --> 02:36:29.060]  Well, we have it discounted by $5 out of the gates.
[02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:34.961]  That was... I consulted for free as long as I could get the film first, and so that is why we have it before anybody else does.
[02:36:34.961 --> 02:36:43.863]  American Drug War, The Last White Hope, it's still a... When they raided him and set him up, they said, oh, big star on TV, you know, and made a big point of that.
[02:36:43.863 --> 02:36:45.363]  This is just political persecution.
[02:36:45.803 --> 02:36:47.164]  Well, thank you for having me.
[02:36:47.164 --> 02:36:48.945]  It's a great honor to be here today.
[02:36:48.945 --> 02:36:49.405]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:36:49.405 --> 02:36:56.090]  And I certainly hope that the American people will get an education on what's really going on with the government today.
[02:37:08.343 --> 02:37:14.726]  Now, I want to talk about what happened with your case, and I want to talk about where it's going.
[02:37:14.726 --> 02:37:24.849]  You've been indicted, and I haven't even talked to you yet about what happened this week when they were going to go ahead with the proceedings, so I want to discuss that with you.
[02:37:24.849 --> 02:37:28.711]  But then, from your law enforcement history and Vietnam history,
[02:37:29.418 --> 02:37:33.802]  Well, basically what happened was that for the past year or so, there was an individual who was selling me guns.
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:56.620]  I think so.
[02:38:16.704 --> 02:38:17.365]  We're good to go.
[02:38:35.585 --> 02:38:46.708]  I've been forewarned that an assistant United States attorney out of the McAllen office, a totally defense attorney, for me to be, watch my back, because they were going to come back to me and they were going to get me one way or the other.
[02:38:46.708 --> 02:38:48.549]  That's because you've testified as an expert witness.
[02:38:48.549 --> 02:38:49.069]  Exactly.
[02:38:49.069 --> 02:38:58.852]  I've testified on the corruption that the government has conducted, the outrageous government conduct that they developed during the case, the perjury before the agents, before grand juries.
[02:38:59.492 --> 02:39:09.881]  And I exposed all that, and now we also have exposed that there have been some transcripts that have been changed, or maybe, as they say.
[02:39:09.881 --> 02:39:17.528]  So all this information that I've obtained within the past few years has come back to bite me in the butt for exposing it.
[02:39:17.528 --> 02:39:19.290]  And you had no criminal record before this.
[02:39:19.290 --> 02:39:24.294]  For listeners that don't know who you are, give them... I know you don't like to talk about yourself, but you've had quite a history.
[02:39:24.714 --> 02:39:28.476]  Exactly, you know, I come from a very patriotic family.
[02:39:28.476 --> 02:39:34.180]  American, to be an American was number one in my family, patriotic.
[02:39:34.180 --> 02:39:38.623]  My family served, you know, my uncles, everybody served in the military.
[02:39:38.623 --> 02:39:42.425]  And as the only son, I was told to go serve my country, pay my dues to my country.
[02:39:42.425 --> 02:39:44.666]  And I did, and I followed my dad's footsteps.
[02:39:44.666 --> 02:39:46.808]  He was in law enforcement, and so was I.
[02:39:47.728 --> 02:39:48.849]  He was also in World War II.
[02:39:48.849 --> 02:39:49.789]  He was in World War II.
[02:39:49.789 --> 02:39:51.750]  He was shot six times in the Philippines.
[02:39:51.750 --> 02:39:56.292]  He paid his dues, as they say.
[02:39:56.292 --> 02:40:03.255]  We continue to be proud Americans and we try to do everything that law-abiding citizens will do.
[02:40:04.656 --> 02:40:06.197]  And you went to Vietnam?
[02:40:06.197 --> 02:40:07.457]  I went to Vietnam.
[02:40:07.457 --> 02:40:23.082]  I did what I did as an infantry sergeant, and I was down there as an 11B bra, as they say, and spent my year in Vietnam, came back, went to school, got my degree, and working as a police officer in the state of Texas, detective sergeant, and so forth.
[02:40:23.082 --> 02:40:25.323]  So I got over 20 years of law enforcement experience.
[02:40:25.903 --> 02:40:29.385]  I've never broken the law in my life, in my adult life.
[02:40:29.385 --> 02:40:45.293]  I've just never been arrested or anything like that, and then all of a sudden the government comes after me because I had, first of all, I think this was initiated with my expert witness, and secondly, when I tried to set up a sting operation against ATF a few months back.
[02:40:45.293 --> 02:40:46.593]  And you did that with the local news.
[02:40:46.593 --> 02:40:46.993]  Exactly.
[02:40:46.993 --> 02:40:54.417]  In fact, you exposed, they did expose, that they were spying on everybody, violating their Fourth Amendment, with cameras rigged in there in the South Texas gun show.
[02:40:54.877 --> 02:41:13.938]  Exactly, what they were doing, they were filming the shows and they were profiling people that were coming out of the gun shows and they were entrapping them in trying to buy the guns that they just legally bought and also they were going out to the people's residence after they bought the gun to find out if they still had that gun with them.
[02:41:14.478 --> 02:41:15.939]  And that's Gestapo tactics.
[02:41:15.939 --> 02:41:24.242]  You don't, you know, you don't profile, it's against a lot of profile, and yet the ATF was doing all these kinds of atrocities and nobody was stopping them.
[02:41:24.242 --> 02:41:31.745]  Okay, but let's go back now, before we get more into this story, for those that don't know, and you've got your book Powder Burns at powderburns.org that everybody should visit.
[02:41:32.686 --> 02:41:35.367]  Tell people about your experience in the DEA.
[02:41:35.367 --> 02:41:40.111]  My experience with the DEA was something that I am not very proud of, number one.
[02:41:40.111 --> 02:41:46.736]  Number two, I believed that what I was doing, by placing my life on the line, that I would make a difference in preserving my country.
[02:41:46.736 --> 02:41:54.221]  And as it turned out, after 12 years with the DEA, my last six in Central America, found out that we were the enemy.
[02:41:54.221 --> 02:41:56.403]  We were the guys involved in the atrocities.
[02:41:56.403 --> 02:41:58.705]  We were the guys that were involved in drug trafficking.
[02:41:59.545 --> 02:42:13.571]  The CIA was heavily involved in drug trafficking with Posadas-Carriles, with Oliver North, Felix Rodriguez, all those Cuban exiles that were down there running this covert operation that was run by the White House during the Bush-Reagan era.
[02:42:13.571 --> 02:42:16.413]  Who blow up Olympic athletes in their prime time.
[02:42:16.413 --> 02:42:17.013]  Exactly.
[02:42:17.013 --> 02:42:17.713]  Evicted.
[02:42:17.713 --> 02:42:18.374]  And not only that.
[02:42:18.374 --> 02:42:19.594]  And then blamed it on other people.
[02:42:19.594 --> 02:42:25.557]  Yeah, well, Luis Posadas, of course, was helped by Felix Rodriguez, a CIA operative.
[02:42:26.677 --> 02:42:27.738]  I don't think so.
[02:42:38.536 --> 02:42:44.121]  Specifically, let's just hit the key points, because I want to get into your case, but I want people to understand the background on this.
[02:42:44.121 --> 02:42:49.965]  Specifically, key evidence that you witnessed yourself of government shipping the drugs en masse out.
[02:42:49.965 --> 02:42:50.406]  Exactly.
[02:42:50.406 --> 02:42:53.648]  There were large shipments of drugs coming into this country.
[02:42:53.648 --> 02:43:00.253]  Now, they were, Guatemala or Central America, I should say, was used as a trampling for drugs to go into the U.S.
[02:43:00.253 --> 02:43:05.658]  And I personally participated in refueling those clandestine airstrips
[02:43:06.438 --> 02:43:11.901]  Uh, airplanes that were being refueled in, uh, in Central America.
[02:43:11.901 --> 02:43:17.343]  And, uh, you know, they were shipped with that hundreds and hundreds of kilos of cocaine.
[02:43:17.343 --> 02:43:29.569]  And yet they were never being seized in the U. S. Uh, basically, it was a CIA court operation that was being run to funnel drugs and profits into the countries in Nicaragua.
[02:43:29.569 --> 02:43:31.250]  And, of course, a lot of the American, uh,
[02:43:32.341 --> 02:43:36.059]  Uh, agents that were involved were lining their pockets and going to Swiss bank accounts.
[02:43:37.532 --> 02:43:42.195]  Going to Swiss bank accounts, and now they're going to keep us safe, Shelley, from terrorism!
[02:43:42.195 --> 02:44:04.271]  And then it turns out that every one of these so-called al-Qaeda individuals was admittedly CIA, used against the Serbs in the late 90s, used against Iran, these Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia are our buddies, and that they weren't even involved in the attacks, but they play the part of that, and then release these tapes that are uploaded by the intel center that's run by all these former CIA spooks, with the video posting
[02:44:04.771 --> 02:44:09.932]  In the same layer, and experts have looked at it, mainstream news has reported it's staged.
[02:44:09.932 --> 02:44:14.573]  How do you think people in our government got to the point of being willing to carry out terror attacks?
[02:44:14.573 --> 02:44:18.594]  Well, it's basically what's happening now is that there's no shame.
[02:44:18.594 --> 02:44:23.335]  They're so bold in what they're doing, and yet they're trying to blame those third world countries.
[02:44:23.335 --> 02:44:31.777]  And I've always said that every major terrorist in this world worked for the United States government at one time or another.
[02:44:32.455 --> 02:44:37.119]  So, we're the ones that are building this beast, as we call them.
[02:44:37.119 --> 02:44:39.661]  And it's to destabilize all these third world countries.
[02:44:39.661 --> 02:44:40.262]  Exactly.
[02:44:40.262 --> 02:44:44.285]  And, you know, we know where Bin Laden is, you know, but we need him for this war.
[02:44:44.285 --> 02:44:46.567]  You know, we've got the best satellite networks in the world.
[02:44:46.567 --> 02:44:56.395]  We could actually find out where he's at, but we need him as a reason to keep this war going on, this atrocity that's happening down in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:44:56.395 --> 02:44:59.598]  Well, they're now claiming that 9-11 Truth works with Al-Qaeda.
[02:45:00.689 --> 02:45:06.172]  Well, certainly, there's always going to be a spin put on by the government, and anything that they do... Well, why is it so ridiculous now?
[02:45:06.172 --> 02:45:11.595]  Well, because it's obviously that what they're telling us is not true.
[02:45:11.595 --> 02:45:22.462]  It's obviously that, or both, as I say, that they continue to feed American all these lies, when in fact,
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:29.324]  The American people are starting to wake up a little bit, not that much though, just a little bit.
[02:45:29.324 --> 02:45:39.932]  And that's why we're having a response now of what happened the past eight years here with George W. And basically we're going to
[02:45:41.084 --> 02:45:46.786]  Come November of next year, we'll find out who's, you know, we're on the right track or not.
[02:45:46.786 --> 02:45:50.307]  I think we're going to find we're on the wrong track, but they'll at least have to act like they're changing.
[02:45:50.307 --> 02:45:53.108]  There's no doubt, though, this has been the black-op presidency.
[02:45:53.108 --> 02:45:54.908]  I mean, they've just gone wild.
[02:45:54.908 --> 02:45:56.989]  This is what the private
[02:45:57.589 --> 02:46:01.752]  Guys that run our government, and the CIA and others, they just work for the big banks.
[02:46:01.752 --> 02:46:03.634]  I mean, this is who we're dealing with.
[02:46:03.634 --> 02:46:05.796]  These are people who are destroying our country.
[02:46:05.796 --> 02:46:08.618]  Everything they're doing is to get rid of our country.
[02:46:08.618 --> 02:46:10.900]  And I just, how dare them say they're patriots?
[02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:11.480]  Exactly.
[02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:18.125]  And you know, the same people that, the same terror cell that I called that worked back in the 80s for the U.S.
[02:46:18.125 --> 02:46:19.987]  government, are still at the White House.
[02:46:19.987 --> 02:46:25.131]  You know, all those people that were involved in those corporate operations are still running
[02:46:29.915 --> 02:46:32.357]  I want to get into your case now.
[02:46:32.357 --> 02:46:37.002]  You were on with us early last week.
[02:46:37.002 --> 02:46:38.704]  Now there's been some new developments.
[02:46:42.256 --> 02:46:44.858]  Here with all of the listeners.
[02:46:44.858 --> 02:46:47.400]  It's a gray area with these straw purchases.
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:51.923]  You can go to a thousand gun shows and see people selling 20, 30, 40, 50 guns.
[02:46:51.923 --> 02:46:53.164]  They go out and buy the guns.
[02:46:53.164 --> 02:46:53.945]  They're collectors.
[02:46:53.945 --> 02:46:55.106]  They sell some of them.
[02:46:55.106 --> 02:46:57.167]  You got into this, you told me, because you're an author.
[02:46:57.167 --> 02:46:59.369]  You would go to the gun shows and sell powder burns.
[02:46:59.369 --> 02:47:00.109]  You're a veteran.
[02:47:00.109 --> 02:47:00.850]  You like guns.
[02:47:00.850 --> 02:47:03.112]  You're a retired police officer, DEA.
[02:47:04.188 --> 02:47:07.529]  And you're there just selling a few shotguns, handguns, things like that.
[02:47:07.529 --> 02:47:10.710]  You told the whole story about how, hey, you know, let's get into this.
[02:47:10.710 --> 02:47:11.370]  Hey, give me money.
[02:47:11.370 --> 02:47:13.391]  I'll get you good deals on guns.
[02:47:13.391 --> 02:47:21.353]  And how they selectively enforce on people, so when you say, well, I didn't know it was illegal, well, you know, the BATF, the scallywags they are, I mean, they just do what they want.
[02:47:22.026 --> 02:47:32.653]  And so I want to be clear that you're saying, okay, I'm guilty, but the guy that sold me these guns, you know, last time you said it, it's pretty obvious that he was setting you up.
[02:47:32.653 --> 02:47:33.954]  It's like Randy Weaver.
[02:47:33.954 --> 02:47:37.796]  They kept saying, please, I'll give you five times what the guns were if you just saw it off.
[02:47:37.796 --> 02:47:38.417]  Just take them.
[02:47:38.417 --> 02:47:40.518]  His kids were hungry and he said, okay, and did it.
[02:47:40.518 --> 02:47:43.480]  And it was all because he wouldn't snitch on locals.
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:44.401]  And this is all admitted.
[02:47:44.401 --> 02:47:46.202]  So they went ahead and just came up and killed his family.
[02:47:47.223 --> 02:47:49.706]  I mean, who are these guys in law enforcement?
[02:47:49.706 --> 02:47:57.455]  Because I know they're not all bad, but it seems more and more it's this attitude of, we run everything, we're the boss, and they really are just thugs who want to rule.
[02:47:57.455 --> 02:48:07.226]  Well, the problem that I foresaw when this occurred to me was the fact that those agents, a lot of them are Iraqi veterans.
[02:48:08.115 --> 02:48:12.136]  And Golf Veterans also from the Gulf War.
[02:48:12.136 --> 02:48:14.377]  And basically you can see it in their eyes.
[02:48:14.377 --> 02:48:18.018]  These guys are suffering from PTSD, I mean big time.
[02:48:18.018 --> 02:48:21.738]  Yet they carry a gun and a badge, you know, just like I did.
[02:48:21.738 --> 02:48:27.220]  You know, and certainly it's poor judgment in their part and what they do.
[02:48:27.220 --> 02:48:35.482]  And right now if you go to a gun show, we have guys, we got half of the gun show that sells AR-15s without paperwork.
[02:48:36.062 --> 02:48:46.147]  And yet, they don't touch them, they don't do anything to them, and they know very well, but their whole purpose on this thing is to shut down the gun shows under the Second Amendment.
[02:48:46.147 --> 02:48:48.207]  We're losing those rights to bear arms.
[02:48:48.207 --> 02:48:50.769]  Yeah, so everything is only registered guns.
[02:48:50.769 --> 02:48:52.789]  Now, let's go back here.
[02:48:52.789 --> 02:48:55.831]  People think PTSD means you lay on the ground and can't get up.
[02:48:55.831 --> 02:48:56.011]  No.
[02:48:56.804 --> 02:49:06.968]  It means that you stay active and aggressive and look for fights and look for excitement, and then if you don't have that excitement, you then get totally exhausted.
[02:49:06.968 --> 02:49:09.889]  And I'm not saying I have it, but it's similar to being really working hard.
[02:49:09.889 --> 02:49:13.750]  If I go on a week-long vacation, I feel like somebody beat the hell out of me.
[02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:18.492]  Because I have to keep working all the time, and a lot of these cops, you see them, they're out of their minds.
[02:49:18.492 --> 02:49:22.733]  Because it is a stress, more alcoholism, more suicide, you know, everything.
[02:49:22.933 --> 02:49:28.497]  Yeah, you know, that's the problem, you know, that PTSD cannot be cured, number one.
[02:49:28.497 --> 02:49:35.582]  Number two, I've been certified by the Department of Justice when I worked for the DEA that I have severe PTSD.
[02:49:35.582 --> 02:49:40.585]  And from my veterans, being a Vietnam veteran, the same thing, I've been certified as having major PTSD.
[02:49:40.585 --> 02:49:45.368]  And that's why you kept looking for the action, writing coca fields, writing facilities.
[02:49:45.368 --> 02:49:47.330]  Writing the edges, they say, you know, trying to...
[02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:49.031]  Drug deals with killers?
[02:49:49.031 --> 02:50:00.618]  Yes, and you know, I was putting my life on the line, and I really thought that at one time that I was actually doing it for my country, which I was, but the majority, I was still looking.
[02:50:00.618 --> 02:50:03.460]  That's why when I left Vietnam, I went into law enforcement.
[02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:07.322]  I was still looking for that bullet with my name on it, you know, and the guilt.
[02:50:07.322 --> 02:50:09.103]  Well, you also get addicted to the action.
[02:50:09.103 --> 02:50:16.668]  Exactly, it's an addiction, and you know, thank God that one of the things that has saved me a lot was the fact that
[02:50:17.368 --> 02:50:23.309]  I don't drink or do drugs, but my medication was having a sense of humor.
[02:50:23.309 --> 02:50:24.889]  And that's what kept me going.
[02:50:24.889 --> 02:50:30.190]  But yet, it's so depressing right now, what happened to me, that I felt, well, what did I go wrong in my world?
[02:50:30.190 --> 02:50:31.391]  Well, Selly, you gotta beat them.
[02:50:31.391 --> 02:50:33.851]  I mean, good guys always get targeted.
[02:50:33.851 --> 02:50:36.872]  We're gonna talk about trying to support you and help you on the other side.
[02:50:36.872 --> 02:50:37.992]  The fourth hour is coming up.
[02:50:37.992 --> 02:50:41.613]  You can see the video right now if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[02:50:41.613 --> 02:50:43.193]  We'll be right back with Selly Castillo.
[02:50:48.550 --> 02:50:49.970]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:49.970 --> 02:50:52.791]  A New World Order.
[02:50:52.791 --> 02:50:57.292]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:57.292 --> 02:51:00.512]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:00.512 --> 02:51:03.293]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:03.293 --> 02:51:06.493]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:06.493 --> 02:51:13.795]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:16.841 --> 02:51:22.265]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:22.265 --> 02:51:26.147]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:26.147 --> 02:51:28.729]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:51:28.729 --> 02:51:29.890]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:29.890 --> 02:51:30.670]  They're not after money.
[02:51:30.670 --> 02:51:31.931]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:31.931 --> 02:51:32.932]  They're after power.
[02:51:32.932 --> 02:51:34.073]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:46.621]  You have been warned.
[02:51:47.702 --> 02:51:51.967]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:51:51.967 --> 02:51:55.532]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:51:55.532 --> 02:51:59.036]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:51:59.292 --> 02:52:02.554]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:52:02.554 --> 02:52:08.056]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:52:08.056 --> 02:52:15.200]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs.
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:17.801]  A few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:52:17.801 --> 02:52:19.181]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:52:19.181 --> 02:52:24.584]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:52:25.084 --> 02:52:29.547]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:52:29.547 --> 02:52:31.148]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:52:31.148 --> 02:52:35.491]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:52:35.491 --> 02:52:37.112]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:52:49.173 --> 02:52:50.534]  I'm Harold Williams.
[02:52:50.534 --> 02:52:52.615]  I know about martial law.
[02:52:52.615 --> 02:52:54.516]  I want to teach you how to survive it.
[02:52:54.516 --> 02:53:03.461]  America has 10 telling signs of martial law, so use the short time left to learn to protect your family with the vital information in this book.
[02:53:03.461 --> 02:53:06.223]  Find the book at survivemartiallaw.com.
[02:53:06.223 --> 02:53:09.685]  I will tell you what you need to know to prepare for martial law.
[02:53:09.685 --> 02:53:10.986]  Things are changing fast.
[02:53:11.266 --> 02:53:14.069]  We even email you a free weekly update.
[02:53:14.069 --> 02:53:21.477]  I teach you how to act around troops, where to put supplies, how to be safe during the worst part of martial law, which is in the beginning.
[02:53:21.477 --> 02:53:25.521]  Surviving this major life transition can be difficult, but possible.
[02:53:25.521 --> 02:53:30.486]  Arm yourself with the knowledge, as this is the only weapon you will have to protect your family.
[02:53:30.626 --> 02:53:32.267]  Go to survivemartiallaw.com or call 866-644-1933.
[02:53:32.267 --> 02:53:33.927]  Act today as there will be no warning.
[02:53:33.927 --> 02:53:34.027]  866-644-1933.
[02:53:34.027 --> 02:53:35.728]  Find the book at survivemartiallaw.com.
[02:53:35.728 --> 02:53:36.268]  Protect your family!
[02:53:55.456 --> 02:53:57.978]  Well, nobody can say I'm not living my life to its fullest.
[02:53:57.978 --> 02:54:01.760]  Nobody can say that I was squeamish or that I didn't have an effect.
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:08.224]  And I know you listeners out there are having a great effect, too, and I salute each and every one of you.
[02:54:08.224 --> 02:54:11.686]  Every one of you out there is just fabulous and we love you.
[02:54:12.901 --> 02:54:22.047]  We're about to start the fourth hour that's going on many of our AM and FM affiliates simulcasting on WWCR and the internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:22.047 --> 02:54:29.712]  If you are a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you will be able to watch the fourth hour here with the guest cam.
[02:54:30.519 --> 02:54:38.082]  And the document cam, and the DVD cam where we can play you audio clips, video clips, computer clips, and a lot more.
[02:54:38.082 --> 02:54:51.886]  Before we continue with Selle Castillo and how he's been set up, and I also want to talk to him about this, what we believe is a murder of Riyad Hamad here in Austin, Texas, a Palestinian activist bound and gagged, thrown in the river.
[02:54:51.886 --> 02:54:56.148]  I want to encourage everybody out there to support our sponsors.
[02:54:56.148 --> 02:54:59.049]  If you go to InfoWars.com, there is a banner
[02:54:59.953 --> 02:55:08.238]  Uh, that says, Aloe Ease Body Cleanse, Aloe Vera, really good for flushing out your system, making you lose weight, detoxifying your GI tract.
[02:55:08.238 --> 02:55:11.720]  A lot of people get cancer because all the toxins we eat build up there.
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:14.402]  Great sponsor, Aloe Ease Colon and Body Cleanse.
[02:55:14.402 --> 02:55:17.924]  There's a link to New Vitality with the hundreds of fabulous products.
[02:55:17.924 --> 02:55:22.406]  This is one of the biggest, most respected mainline vitamin supplement companies out there.
[02:55:22.406 --> 02:55:24.428]  We're very honored to have them as sponsors.
[02:55:24.428 --> 02:55:26.029]  You can go to their website by linking through at
[02:55:27.169 --> 02:55:32.031]  Infowars.com to NewVitality.com or by calling 1-800-569-4056.
[02:55:32.031 --> 02:55:32.211]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:55:32.211 --> 02:55:39.335]  One of their other great products is Super Beta Prostate.
[02:55:39.335 --> 02:55:42.776]  These are well-known herbs for shrinking the prostate, giving you better health.
[02:55:42.776 --> 02:55:45.978]  Even a lot of doctors are now prescribing these herbs for prostate.
[02:55:45.978 --> 02:55:46.818]  That's medical doctors.
[02:55:46.818 --> 02:55:47.058]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:55:47.058 --> 02:55:53.321]  The well-recognized, well-documented, proven herbs and remedies.
[02:55:53.321 --> 02:55:54.021]  That's what they've got at
[02:55:55.874 --> 02:55:59.562]  NewVitality.com or 1-800-569-4056.
[02:55:59.562 --> 02:56:03.089]  And in closing for this hour, we can't do anything we do here.
[02:56:04.426 --> 02:56:05.806]  Without your support.
[02:56:05.806 --> 02:56:10.108]  We can't do anything on this radio show without your financial support.
[02:56:10.108 --> 02:56:13.048]  And that's why you need to get American Drug War from us.
[02:56:13.048 --> 02:56:15.729]  It's not available anywhere else right now.
[02:56:15.729 --> 02:56:22.151]  It is available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:56:22.151 --> 02:56:26.452]  This proves how alcohol and other things kill hundreds of thousands.
[02:56:26.452 --> 02:56:27.933]  Marijuana, no one.
[02:56:27.933 --> 02:56:30.013]  It proves how the government is shipping in drugs.
[02:56:30.013 --> 02:56:32.114]  It proves how they selectively enforce things.
[02:56:32.114 --> 02:56:33.034]  Went for Tommy Chung.
[02:56:33.454 --> 02:56:33.855]  We're good to go.
[02:56:48.264 --> 02:56:54.105]  Danny Danko of High Times, Medical Marijuana with Dr. Jensen, and so many others.
[02:56:54.105 --> 02:56:57.386]  This is a very, very important film.
[02:56:57.386 --> 02:56:59.346]  American Drug War, The Last White Hope.
[02:56:59.346 --> 02:57:03.187]  Also, the new film, Washington, You Are Fired, is out.
[02:57:03.187 --> 02:57:06.708]  It is part two to America, freedom to fascism.
[02:57:06.708 --> 02:57:08.988]  I hope everyone will get it as well.
[02:57:08.988 --> 02:57:10.429]  It needs to be seen.
[02:57:10.429 --> 02:57:12.009]  It needs to be gotten out.
[02:57:12.009 --> 02:57:13.829]  We are allowed to fire these people.
[02:57:13.829 --> 02:57:16.170]  We are allowed to kick the government out of our lives.
[02:57:16.770 --> 02:57:21.176]  Also, I want to ask listeners to support all of our AM and FM affiliates by supporting their sponsors.
[02:57:21.176 --> 02:57:24.379]  Support everybody that sponsors this show.
[02:57:24.379 --> 02:57:28.344]  We couldn't do it without them, and we can't do it without you, the listeners.
[02:57:28.344 --> 02:57:29.586]  We're about to start the fourth hour.
[02:57:30.362 --> 02:57:37.348]  Everybody on the radio network can listen, or again, watch us online at PrisonPlanet.tv when this show becomes a TV show.
[02:57:37.348 --> 02:57:42.392]  We're streaming right now, but Sally, in the minute we've got left in this hour, give out your Powder Burns website.
[02:57:42.392 --> 02:57:45.195]  You are basically broke right now as a school teacher.
[02:57:45.195 --> 02:57:47.657]  You and your family.
[02:57:47.657 --> 02:57:49.318]  PowderBurns.org.
[02:57:49.318 --> 02:57:51.320]  People need to go there, buy your book Powder Burns.
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:52.961]  It's almost out of print.
[02:57:52.961 --> 02:57:53.902]  Excellent book.
[02:57:53.902 --> 02:57:57.005]  They need to make contributions to you, or you're going to go to prison.
[02:57:58.301 --> 02:58:03.884]  I need some monies to pay my attorney, and guys, you can email me or send me a check.
[02:58:03.884 --> 02:58:08.287]  My address is on my email address.
[02:58:08.287 --> 02:58:12.709]  Or you can actually call me and I'll give you the information.
[02:58:12.709 --> 02:58:15.471]  Once again, 956-345-5770.
[02:58:15.471 --> 02:58:22.755]  We're going to get that out again next hour, but Selly is on the front lines for you.
[02:58:22.755 --> 02:58:25.216]  We've got to support him, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:25.216 --> 02:58:26.557]  We'll be right back with a fourth hour.
[02:58:29.220 --> 02:58:30.624]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:30.624 --> 02:58:34.615]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:38.499 --> 02:58:40.460]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:58:40.460 --> 02:58:44.061]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:44.061 --> 02:58:46.522]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:46.522 --> 02:58:49.564]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:49.564 --> 02:58:55.306]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:58:55.306 --> 02:58:59.208]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:58:59.548 --> 02:59:04.731]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:59:04.731 --> 02:59:07.793]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:59:36.617 --> 02:59:41.103]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:41.103 --> 02:59:43.485]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.485 --> 02:59:46.248]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:59:57.751 --> 03:00:03.773]  Celi Castillo III, PowderBurns.org is our guest for another 30 minutes and I've got a huge news blitz coming up.
[03:00:03.773 --> 03:00:07.094]  Sorry, no calls today.
[03:00:07.094 --> 03:00:09.614]  But I think we're going to have open phones quite a bit throughout the week.
[03:00:09.614 --> 03:00:14.856]  We've got some huge guests coming up this week though, but believe me, the news, you've got to stay with us for that.
[03:00:14.856 --> 03:00:25.719]  I want to get Celi as a former police officer, former army sniper, former DEA agent who worked all sorts of hardcore cases in Latin America.
[03:00:26.943 --> 03:00:27.843]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:00:41.918 --> 03:00:42.318]  We're good to go.
[03:01:07.699 --> 03:01:10.500]  Boy, as we said a year before, he did that it was a pipe drain.
[03:01:10.500 --> 03:01:18.122]  His so-called friend, who he actually wrote about and said wasn't his friend, came out and said that, oh, it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head.
[03:01:18.122 --> 03:01:24.324]  Cop of the Year, of course, Terence Yeakey, who brought out the people of Oklahoma City, who saw the BATF involved.
[03:01:24.324 --> 03:01:26.085]  He called his partner and said, Feds are following me.
[03:01:26.085 --> 03:01:27.205]  I got the files.
[03:01:27.205 --> 03:01:30.066]  They told him to turn the files in he had.
[03:01:30.066 --> 03:01:34.107]  He was tortured, stabbed, burned, electrical burns, two bullet holes in the back of the head.
[03:01:34.107 --> 03:01:35.607]  That's their own autopsy.
[03:01:35.607 --> 03:01:37.228]  They said he shot himself twice in the back of the head.
[03:01:38.368 --> 03:01:40.110]  Well, basically what it is, is they try to
[03:01:56.840 --> 03:01:57.440]  I think so.
[03:02:28.311 --> 03:02:36.315]  And you described, in his case there's no note, he told no one, but in some cases there's even notes and it's come out a letter that they were killed and you described on air how that works.
[03:02:36.315 --> 03:02:42.098]  You walk in your house, they put you in handcuffs, they say here's your kids, we're gonna kill them if you don't write this down.
[03:02:42.098 --> 03:02:45.280]  Exactly, and basically I knew, I know of two cases
[03:02:46.113 --> 03:02:51.381]  That's actually what happened and they gave the guy to think about it and he actually thought about it.
[03:02:51.381 --> 03:02:57.369]  He was happy at the very end of what he was going to do because you know he was saving his family and he actually
[03:02:59.455 --> 03:03:03.459]  Uh, committed suicide by, by them forcing him to do that.
[03:03:03.459 --> 03:03:09.424]  And, uh, he did that and sometimes they're forced to write a letter and, and, uh, and then it happens.
[03:03:09.424 --> 03:03:20.514]  And what happens is the, uh, the government is, is good at doing that and they do follow through on, on killing a member of his family, whether it's an accident or a drowning or, or something like that, but it does happen.
[03:03:21.471 --> 03:03:29.795]  Have you seen the movie The Shooter with Wahlberg, where the government's got the apparatus where they make you shoot yourself?
[03:03:29.795 --> 03:03:31.236]  Exactly.
[03:03:31.236 --> 03:03:36.118]  I saw that a lot of times in Central America.
[03:03:36.118 --> 03:03:41.461]  Basically, ironically enough, just recently in Guatemala,
[03:03:42.293 --> 03:03:42.693]  I think so.
[03:04:00.661 --> 03:04:01.242]  We're good to go.
[03:04:15.968 --> 03:04:19.213]  Bottom line is this guy just got whacked last week.
[03:04:19.213 --> 03:04:23.739]  I mean he, two cars below him, next to him, just shot the hell out of him.
[03:04:23.739 --> 03:04:26.242]  But he knew so much and he was working for the CIA.
[03:04:26.242 --> 03:04:27.524]  Who do you think killed him?
[03:04:27.524 --> 03:04:30.348]  Well, it's probably the same government and the CIA.
[03:04:30.348 --> 03:04:32.411]  He became a liability and they whacked him.
[03:04:34.042 --> 03:04:35.883]  And, you know, he worked for so many years.
[03:04:35.883 --> 03:04:39.925]  If you work for the Central Intelligence Agency, you're usually protected.
[03:04:39.925 --> 03:04:44.327]  But when this happened, it comes to a point that this guy... Stay there.
[03:04:44.327 --> 03:04:45.388]  We don't need him anymore.
[03:04:45.388 --> 03:04:45.648]  Good.
[03:04:45.648 --> 03:04:46.128]  Stay there.
[03:04:46.128 --> 03:04:47.569]  It is a big idea.
[03:04:47.569 --> 03:04:50.371]  A new world order.
[03:04:50.371 --> 03:04:55.273]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:04:55.273 --> 03:04:58.095]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:04:58.095 --> 03:05:00.296]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:05:00.882 --> 03:05:04.049]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:05:04.049 --> 03:05:11.385]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:05:14.397 --> 03:05:19.841]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:05:19.841 --> 03:05:23.143]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:05:23.143 --> 03:05:26.285]  The old Americans are making great progress toward a world government.
[03:05:26.285 --> 03:05:27.446]  Most people have no idea.
[03:05:27.446 --> 03:05:28.226]  They're not after money.
[03:05:28.226 --> 03:05:29.507]  They have all the money they need.
[03:05:29.507 --> 03:05:30.488]  They're after power.
[03:05:30.488 --> 03:05:31.649]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:06:44.687 --> 03:06:45.167]  Fact.
[03:06:45.167 --> 03:06:51.172]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[03:06:51.172 --> 03:06:55.515]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[03:06:55.515 --> 03:07:03.181]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[03:07:03.181 --> 03:07:03.942]  The solution.
[03:07:03.942 --> 03:07:08.165]  Detoxification integrated with Electrochi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[03:07:08.165 --> 03:07:10.147]  The Electrochi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[03:07:10.287 --> 03:07:10.647]  I don't know.
[03:07:30.140 --> 03:07:33.723]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:33.723 --> 03:07:35.184]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:01.431 --> 03:08:06.893]  Shelly and I were talking during the break about 18 veterans a day.
[03:08:06.893 --> 03:08:09.353]  I saw the federal study last week committing suicide.
[03:08:09.353 --> 03:08:12.194]  Those that don't commit suicide... See, in World War II, they knew.
[03:08:12.194 --> 03:08:13.514]  In World War I, they knew.
[03:08:13.514 --> 03:08:20.977]  If you spent a year, or 11 and a half months, on average in a term, you would have about half the people have problems for the rest of their life.
[03:08:20.977 --> 03:08:22.037]  Major mental problems.
[03:08:22.037 --> 03:08:29.359]  Because as tough as you are, really stressful, traumatic things, or even just a lot of hard work, and working 18 hours a day, which happens in combat,
[03:08:29.979 --> 03:08:31.201]  It changes the rest of your life.
[03:08:31.201 --> 03:08:40.653]  You're either a workaholic, either you keep having that, you know, getting yourself to work that hard, or you just basically fall apart and
[03:08:41.587 --> 03:08:42.048]  We're good to go.
[03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:06.474]  Okay, and it's called Catch-22, because yeah, only 22 missions, but you're probably going to die anyways.
[03:09:06.474 --> 03:09:22.747]  You know, that is the situation, and you know, I never knew, I never even knew that my dad's dad was a B-17 gunner until he died, and then they, years later, dug open his almanacs with him in the plane, and photos, and letters, and you know, all his buddies, and them getting shot up by the Germans.
[03:09:22.747 --> 03:09:24.708]  The family didn't even, he wouldn't even talk about it.
[03:09:24.708 --> 03:09:27.470]  And that was just 22 missions over Germany.
[03:09:27.470 --> 03:09:30.533]  So my point is, is that now they're coming home to be cops,
[03:09:31.313 --> 03:09:34.817]  And they're just, their minds are completely fried.
[03:09:34.817 --> 03:09:39.522]  Selly, I mean, what would you have been like if you would have served five tours in Vietnam?
[03:09:39.522 --> 03:09:48.832]  Well, that's really horrible to do that, and yet the Army is still saying that it's okay, that they'll be okay.
[03:09:48.832 --> 03:09:52.997]  And of course it's not, and the majority of the veterans that come back
[03:09:53.763 --> 03:09:55.403]  Want to go into law enforcement?
[03:09:55.403 --> 03:09:58.044]  Because they're still looking for that bullet with their name on it.
[03:09:58.044 --> 03:09:58.924]  I did it.
[03:09:58.924 --> 03:10:07.667]  I got out of Vietnam, went to school right away, became a police officer, detective sergeant, and then worked for the DEA for 12 years.
[03:10:07.667 --> 03:10:11.168]  And basically that's what we normally do.
[03:10:11.168 --> 03:10:14.829]  These ATF agents that arrested me, they're all veterans.
[03:10:14.829 --> 03:10:18.150]  One of them looks like he's really PTSD after serving 10 years in
[03:10:19.511 --> 03:10:24.294]  In the war, or in the military, in the United States Army for 10 years.
[03:10:24.294 --> 03:10:29.157]  And, you know, you could tell, you can see it in his eyes, you know, what the problem is.
[03:10:29.157 --> 03:10:34.621]  And, you know, a lot of us are talking about Iraqi veterans, but the bottom line is... What do their eyes look like?
[03:10:34.621 --> 03:10:36.302]  Describe that and then get back into that.
[03:10:36.302 --> 03:10:37.242]  The eyes are deep.
[03:10:37.242 --> 03:10:40.505]  They're a thousand mile eyes, they call them.
[03:10:40.505 --> 03:10:43.807]  You know, it's a big, you know, the guy is just really deep.
[03:10:45.167 --> 03:10:54.591]  Looking at you, whether he's listening to you or not listening to you, he's just, you know, a glaze in the eye that tells you right off the bat.
[03:10:54.591 --> 03:10:56.612]  And you know what?
[03:10:56.612 --> 03:11:01.794]  There were four suicides in Dallas.
[03:11:01.794 --> 03:11:03.274]  Eighteen a day, you were going to make a point.
[03:11:03.274 --> 03:11:10.237]  Eighteen a day, and there were four this year in Dallas at the VA clinic, or psychiatric ward in Dallas.
[03:11:10.237 --> 03:11:12.098]  So they had to close it down last week.
[03:11:12.098 --> 03:11:12.718]  Well, guess what?
[03:11:13.351 --> 03:11:15.793]  Three of the four were Vietnam vets.
[03:11:15.793 --> 03:11:17.455]  They hung themselves.
[03:11:17.455 --> 03:11:19.176]  58 years old and one was 57, I think.
[03:11:19.176 --> 03:11:29.905]  One of them found him and he later went up there, rented a garage, put his truck back in there, closed the door, and committed suicide.
[03:11:29.905 --> 03:11:30.606]  Why?
[03:11:30.606 --> 03:11:31.127]  You've got it.
[03:11:31.127 --> 03:11:31.727]  Why?
[03:11:31.727 --> 03:11:32.648]  Why does it drive them to do that?
[03:11:32.648 --> 03:11:37.232]  Well, because it's, you know, it's just the older you get,
[03:11:38.268 --> 03:11:40.750]  The worst that PTSD gets on you.
[03:11:40.750 --> 03:11:43.212]  You know, you want to fight everybody.
[03:11:43.212 --> 03:11:44.893]  Everybody's against you.
[03:11:44.893 --> 03:11:47.796]  Emotionally, you're on medication.
[03:11:47.796 --> 03:11:49.077]  You can't sleep at night.
[03:11:49.077 --> 03:11:54.221]  I, yeah, when ATF went into my house, I had guns in the doors of my house.
[03:11:54.221 --> 03:11:55.562]  I sleep with my door open.
[03:11:56.382 --> 03:11:59.524]  Because I want to see who's coming in.
[03:11:59.524 --> 03:12:01.525]  You know, you can't hold a job.
[03:12:01.525 --> 03:12:04.067]  You're married two or three times.
[03:12:04.067 --> 03:12:06.388]  You know, and the signs are there.
[03:12:06.388 --> 03:12:10.450]  And, you know, we're talking about those guys doing three tours, four tours.
[03:12:10.450 --> 03:12:11.111]  Well, you know what?
[03:12:11.111 --> 03:12:15.133]  I did six straight years in Central America, training dead squats.
[03:12:15.133 --> 03:12:17.474]  Now tell me if that does not affect me.
[03:12:17.474 --> 03:12:18.555]  Of course it does.
[03:12:18.555 --> 03:12:23.958]  And then I come home, and you know, I was talking to a group of veterans just last week.
[03:12:24.582 --> 03:12:30.445]  And he said, you know, I feel so bad, so guilty because I got divorced and I wasn't there for my kids.
[03:12:30.445 --> 03:12:31.646]  And he said, you know what?
[03:12:31.646 --> 03:12:32.866]  Don't feel bad.
[03:12:32.866 --> 03:12:37.409]  It's worse if you're there with the family and you take it out on them.
[03:12:37.409 --> 03:12:40.070]  And I have never, ever looked at that before.
[03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:46.193]  And, and, you know, I apologize every time I talk to my kids three, four times a day.
[03:12:46.193 --> 03:12:49.055]  I talk to them because I want to tell them that I love them and I care about them.
[03:12:49.950 --> 03:12:57.279]  I mean if I ever leave this world I want to make sure that they know that and and it's devastating for them right now because I've always been there for them.
[03:12:57.279 --> 03:13:01.805]  That I'm not going to be there the next 10 years because I'm going to be in prison because of
[03:13:02.449 --> 03:13:05.091]  Because of what I believe in doing.
[03:13:05.091 --> 03:13:06.792]  Because the Second Amendment has to die.
[03:13:06.792 --> 03:13:07.633]  Exactly.
[03:13:07.633 --> 03:13:09.714]  So, you know, that's basically what it is.
[03:13:09.714 --> 03:13:11.336]  And, you know, we're suffering.
[03:13:11.336 --> 03:13:12.436]  What is your lawyer saying?
[03:13:12.436 --> 03:13:13.377]  What is the battle plan?
[03:13:13.377 --> 03:13:14.278]  How do we help you, Sully?
[03:13:14.278 --> 03:13:16.520]  I mean, you said my lawyer sent you around a thousand bucks.
[03:13:16.520 --> 03:13:19.101]  That paid for half the lawyer just in last week's court.
[03:13:19.101 --> 03:13:19.582]  Exactly.
[03:13:19.582 --> 03:13:21.443]  You know, he's asking for $15,000 and I ended up with about $1,000.
[03:13:21.443 --> 03:13:23.124]  And I had to pay him that $1,000 to file the motion to
[03:13:29.602 --> 03:13:29.963]  We're good.
[03:13:49.785 --> 03:13:50.266]  We're good to go.
[03:14:04.326 --> 03:14:05.326]  And that's for me to wear.
[03:14:05.326 --> 03:14:07.467]  And you know, it's a cobbler.
[03:14:07.467 --> 03:14:15.871]  And it is very important to those people that have actually sent me their prayers.
[03:14:15.871 --> 03:14:18.152]  I mean, I'm in their prayers every night.
[03:14:18.152 --> 03:14:23.354]  And people, you know, just become believers in, you know, in God Almighty.
[03:14:23.354 --> 03:14:25.034]  That He'll be there for us.
[03:14:25.034 --> 03:14:26.115]  And I certainly hope.
[03:14:26.115 --> 03:14:28.896]  And if He doesn't, then there's a reason for it.
[03:14:28.896 --> 03:14:31.777]  And I just hope that everything turns out fine with me.
[03:14:32.077 --> 03:14:34.519]  Well, it's a really touching story, Sully.
[03:14:34.519 --> 03:14:37.041]  It's got tears in my eyes.
[03:14:37.041 --> 03:14:42.825]  And I want to talk about that because a lot of these guys that work for the evil, they're like caught up in a rat race.
[03:14:42.825 --> 03:14:43.826]  They're all stressed out.
[03:14:43.826 --> 03:14:44.626]  They're crazy.
[03:14:44.626 --> 03:14:45.887]  They believe the propaganda.
[03:14:45.887 --> 03:14:47.668]  It's about us against them.
[03:14:47.668 --> 03:14:48.789]  How do they do the evil?
[03:14:48.789 --> 03:14:55.514]  I've seen cops frame people all the time and all these squad car videos are coming out now because people are putting hidden cameras in their cars because they're so cheap.
[03:14:56.638 --> 03:14:57.678]  Well, basically what it is, is
[03:15:20.925 --> 03:15:33.853]  There's people here, there's agents, it's a new generation now, before you used to have a little respect for the public, and now what it is, is that they think they're above the law, and a lot of times they are above the law.
[03:15:33.853 --> 03:15:40.097]  And basically, they like to cut corners to make cases, and that's how they get promoted.
[03:15:40.097 --> 03:15:47.342]  The more cases you build, the more people you arrest, the more drugs you seize, or guns you seize, that's how you get promoted.
[03:15:47.342 --> 03:15:49.043]  And so forth, and that's what they're looking for.
[03:15:49.043 --> 03:15:50.384]  And it's better to go after good citizens.
[03:15:50.504 --> 03:15:50.664]  This is
[03:16:09.838 --> 03:16:14.222]  The American M-16s are being sold to the cartels in Mexico.
[03:16:14.222 --> 03:16:15.444]  You know what he said to me?
[03:16:15.444 --> 03:16:22.370]  He said, well, you know what, that's our government selling it to other third world governments, and those third world governments will sell them to the cartels.
[03:16:22.370 --> 03:16:26.034]  Well, I was about to say, and that's who's shooting at the Border Patrol and the FBI, Sheriff's deputies.
[03:16:26.034 --> 03:16:27.075]  But expanding on that,
[03:16:28.697 --> 03:16:34.468]  Bush wants to send $147 billion to the Mexican government to, quote, fight terror and drugs.
[03:16:34.468 --> 03:16:37.033]  That's to consolidate the drug dealing, isn't it?
[03:16:37.033 --> 03:16:37.494]  Exactly.
[03:16:37.494 --> 03:16:39.798]  It's all profits to, you know...
[03:16:41.189 --> 03:16:43.710]  The war on drugs has never worked.
[03:16:43.710 --> 03:16:45.331]  Enforcement has never worked.
[03:16:45.331 --> 03:16:46.632]  Well, it's worked to make more drugs.
[03:16:46.632 --> 03:16:48.653]  Well, yeah, it is.
[03:16:48.653 --> 03:16:49.894]  But it may not work the way they say.
[03:16:49.894 --> 03:16:56.238]  They're supposed to work, and yet Congress keeps funneling millions of dollars into the drug war.
[03:16:56.238 --> 03:16:58.099]  And we got more drugs today than we did 10, 15 years ago.
[03:16:58.099 --> 03:16:58.159]  Why?
[03:17:01.053 --> 03:17:07.459]  That's what they use us to get scared on our kids being on drugs and so forth.
[03:17:07.459 --> 03:17:09.221]  And, you know, it doesn't work.
[03:17:09.221 --> 03:17:12.124]  We spend billions of dollars in search countries.
[03:17:12.124 --> 03:17:13.786]  We can't even make a dent.
[03:17:13.786 --> 03:17:21.293]  So basically, it's got to tell you that the answer has got to be treatment, prevention, and so forth, but not enforcement, because enforcement has never worked.
[03:17:23.067 --> 03:17:37.012]  Shelley, I want to get into this article, and they have links to mainstream news articles, and if you Google this, you can go to the Transportation Authority in California, you can go to the news articles, where they're defending it.
[03:17:37.012 --> 03:17:46.856]  Out of the way, peasants, LewRockwell.com, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, they are a special class of people, basically exempt from the laws, says they're allowed to drink and drive, speed, not pay tolls,
[03:17:47.688 --> 03:17:51.450]  And it says that it's the law enforcement, other government agencies, and their families.
[03:17:51.450 --> 03:17:54.751]  They get special plates.
[03:17:54.751 --> 03:18:05.035]  And it goes into a 1978 program that started to protect the confidentiality of peace officers, so members of the public couldn't find their addresses on Department of Motor Vehicles.
[03:18:05.035 --> 03:18:09.077]  But it says over the years the program has been expanded from one set of government workers to another.
[03:18:10.340 --> 03:18:14.783]  And it just goes on to say that they are allowed to do whatever they want now.
[03:18:14.783 --> 03:18:18.866]  I mean, this is insane that we've gotten to this point, Sully.
[03:18:18.866 --> 03:18:21.408]  Can you speak to that?
[03:18:21.408 --> 03:18:28.954]  Right now we had a constable who used to work, well, that ran for a constable's position there in South Texas.
[03:18:28.954 --> 03:18:35.418]  He worked for DPS for many years and he finally got fired because of family violence.
[03:18:36.719 --> 03:18:37.600]  We're good to go.
[03:18:55.239 --> 03:19:03.884]  And thank God he lost, because, you know, can you imagine a guy like that going into more power, or being a constable, and abusing the citizens?
[03:19:03.884 --> 03:19:20.974]  Well, you're in this film, American Drug War, with Kevin Booth and everybody else, and you've seen the video of Sheriff Arpaio, and I mean, he literally drives his car into businesses, stumbling around, he looks like he's on something, and he's just, when you talk to him,
[03:19:21.889 --> 03:19:23.110]  I've seen raw footage.
[03:19:23.110 --> 03:19:24.871]  The guy is publicly insane.
[03:19:24.871 --> 03:19:25.771]  Well, you know why?
[03:19:25.771 --> 03:19:27.693]  Because he's a Vietnam vet.
[03:19:27.693 --> 03:19:29.874]  I don't know if you were aware of that.
[03:19:29.874 --> 03:19:31.095]  He is a Vietnam vet.
[03:19:31.095 --> 03:19:32.155]  And former DEA.
[03:19:32.155 --> 03:19:33.116]  And former DEA.
[03:19:33.116 --> 03:19:34.717]  And guess who else?
[03:19:34.717 --> 03:19:36.978]  Our presidential candidate.
[03:19:36.978 --> 03:19:38.119]  McCain.
[03:19:38.119 --> 03:19:41.080]  Suffers from PTSD but they will never bring it out.
[03:19:41.080 --> 03:19:42.741]  They say he's got a short fuse.
[03:19:42.741 --> 03:19:44.222]  No, it's his PTSD.
[03:19:44.222 --> 03:19:46.464]  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
[03:19:46.464 --> 03:19:47.864]  It is a big idea.
[03:19:47.864 --> 03:19:49.946]  A new world order.
[03:19:50.689 --> 03:19:55.573]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:19:55.573 --> 03:19:58.415]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:19:58.415 --> 03:20:01.197]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:20:01.197 --> 03:20:04.379]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:20:04.379 --> 03:20:11.705]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:20:14.719 --> 03:20:20.162]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:20:20.162 --> 03:20:24.044]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:20:24.044 --> 03:20:26.605]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:20:26.605 --> 03:20:27.766]  Most people have no idea.
[03:20:27.766 --> 03:20:28.566]  They're not after money.
[03:20:28.566 --> 03:20:29.827]  They have all the money they need.
[03:20:29.827 --> 03:20:30.827]  They're after power.
[03:20:30.827 --> 03:20:31.968]  That's what they're after these years.

[03:20:59.791 --> 03:21:02.592]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[03:21:02.592 --> 03:21:05.033]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[03:21:05.033 --> 03:21:09.975]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[03:21:09.975 --> 03:21:12.435]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[03:21:12.435 --> 03:21:17.777]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[03:21:19.713 --> 03:21:24.295]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.

[03:21:29.117 --> 03:21:34.079]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.

[03:24:05.970 --> 03:24:11.394]  Selly, we're talking about how these guys feel good persecuting you and hopping things up against you, cooking them up.
[03:24:14.918 --> 03:24:21.721]  On a lighter note, what do you think of the final edition of American Drug War that's aired over 50 times on Showtime?
[03:24:21.721 --> 03:24:25.223]  The cops that set you up basically laughed about it.
[03:24:25.223 --> 03:24:26.663]  So that means it's getting out there.
[03:24:26.663 --> 03:24:29.845]  I'm hearing a buzz everywhere about the film.
[03:24:29.845 --> 03:24:31.145]  Give us your take on that.
[03:24:31.145 --> 03:24:38.989]  Well, it's an excellent tape not to blow my horn on because I'm in the DVD.
[03:24:38.989 --> 03:24:40.469]  But it's for the first time ever.
[03:24:41.830 --> 03:24:49.157]  The director of the DEA admitting that the CIA ran drugs back in the 80s.
[03:24:50.211 --> 03:24:51.232]  From Central America.
[03:24:51.232 --> 03:25:01.318]  We had CIA agents, McFarland, out of Honduras, who shipped large quantities of cocaine, over a thousand kilos, to the U.S.
[03:25:01.318 --> 03:25:06.281]  to profit the covert operations being conducted by the CIA.
[03:25:06.281 --> 03:25:09.684]  You know, Noriega, you know, everybody's admitting to the whole thing.
[03:25:09.684 --> 03:25:14.447]  Noriega's being denied a pardon, not a pardon, but a release from prison because
[03:25:15.107 --> 03:25:17.649]  Well, I hope people will get it at Infowars.com.
[03:25:17.649 --> 03:25:24.755]  It's not in stores until May 24th, but I have a deal with a filmmaker because I consulted on it, as you did, that we are selling it
[03:25:34.662 --> 03:25:36.444]  We're good to go.
[03:25:53.899 --> 03:25:54.319]  I think so.
[03:26:12.815 --> 03:26:17.317]  One way people can support you and get your book, well you've got like 300, 400 copies left.
[03:26:17.317 --> 03:26:19.578]  When it's gone, it's out of print, powder burns.
[03:26:19.578 --> 03:26:23.039]  The story of the government dealing the drugs, you witnessing it.
[03:26:23.039 --> 03:26:25.320]  It's a read you can't put down.
[03:26:25.320 --> 03:26:30.062]  And if people will just buy it from you, that will help you try to pay for the lawyer and beat these people.
[03:26:30.062 --> 03:26:32.523]  That way they can donate and actually get something back.
[03:26:32.523 --> 03:26:33.444]  Can you comment on that?
[03:26:33.444 --> 03:26:34.824]  Absolutely.
[03:26:34.824 --> 03:26:36.005]  Every little bit helps.
[03:26:36.005 --> 03:26:36.845]  I've got about 300 copies left.
[03:26:39.166 --> 03:26:45.473]  Uh, you know, I do want to sell them so I could get my financial support for my attorney and my defense, my legal defense.
[03:26:45.473 --> 03:26:51.059]  Um, and go to my website powderburns.org or you can email me directly at powderburns at prodigy.net.
[03:26:51.929 --> 03:26:56.633]  Now to be clear, last week people had to call you or get your address to send you checks.
[03:26:56.633 --> 03:26:59.295]  Now you've got a donation, PayPal, at PowderBurns.org.
[03:26:59.295 --> 03:26:59.856]  Exactly.
[03:26:59.856 --> 03:27:08.062]  It's linked there and you can go straight to it and I'll ship you out the books and whatever donations.
[03:27:08.062 --> 03:27:10.084]  I always send a thank you card for it also.
[03:27:10.084 --> 03:27:11.685]  Yeah, I got a thank you card from you, Selly.
[03:27:11.685 --> 03:27:13.847]  By the way, I don't want thank you cards from you.
[03:27:13.847 --> 03:27:17.670]  You're too busy fighting for your life and your family right now and we appreciate your courage.
[03:27:17.670 --> 03:27:18.230]  Well, thank you, sir.
[03:27:18.230 --> 03:27:20.752]  So just don't worry about sending me a thank you card.
[03:27:20.752 --> 03:27:21.493]  I got your thank you card.
[03:27:21.553 --> 03:27:22.094]  Appreciate it.
[03:27:40.979 --> 03:27:42.782]  I've got a lot of prayers from a lot of people.
[03:27:42.782 --> 03:27:43.402]  A lot of prayer books.
[03:27:56.539 --> 03:27:59.102]  You can tell that the American people are very, very sincere.
[03:27:59.102 --> 03:28:07.813]  I got over 50 letters of people trying, supporting me, sending me donations, little donations, but they mean everything.
[03:28:07.813 --> 03:28:10.156]  And also the purchase of the books.
[03:28:10.156 --> 03:28:13.480]  Like I said, I got plenty of books and I still lead a lot of financial.
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:15.942]  Help and one real fast thing.
[03:28:15.942 --> 03:28:32.234]  I need somebody to donate a tractor trailer a little riding lawnmower tractor because I'm gonna be doing a pilgrimage all the way from my account to San Antonio in protest with PTSD for veterans and I'm trying to get an old tractor so I can ride it up here.
[03:28:32.234 --> 03:28:43.063]  It's gonna take me three or four days and Hopefully bringing awareness to the better somebody to loan you a farm trailer cuz it'll get a lot of attention a little Yeah, a little tractor trailer or riding lawnmower
[03:28:43.063 --> 03:28:53.328]  More, something that I can actually drive all the way from McAllen into San Antonio with a banner saying, you know, support veterans with PTSD.
[03:28:53.328 --> 03:28:58.110]  Well, and they should go with you and support you and maybe videotape it, put it on YouTube to bring attention.
[03:28:58.110 --> 03:28:58.311]  Exactly.
[03:28:58.311 --> 03:28:59.871]  Well, Sully, give out your phone number.
[03:28:59.871 --> 03:29:00.452]  My number is 956-345-5770.
[03:29:00.452 --> 03:29:00.832]  Once again, 956-345-5770.

[03:29:21.293 --> 03:29:26.394]  And they've told him they were going to get him for his political activities here in the land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[03:29:26.394 --> 03:29:28.375]  Hopefully, we can change that back to what we once were.
[03:29:28.375 --> 03:29:31.135]  We've never been perfect, but we are very shameful today.
[03:29:31.135 --> 03:29:32.935]  But thank you for all your support of Sully.

[03:29:56.441 --> 03:29:59.343]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[03:29:59.343 --> 03:30:04.126]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.

[03:31:36.622 --> 03:31:36.803]  to 10 p.m.
[03:31:36.803 --> 03:31:37.863]  Eastern for our easy pay plan today.
[03:31:46.110 --> 03:31:47.531]  It is a big idea.
[03:31:47.531 --> 03:31:50.352]  A New World Order.
[03:31:50.352 --> 03:31:55.235]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:31:55.235 --> 03:31:57.416]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:31:57.416 --> 03:32:00.858]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[03:32:00.858 --> 03:32:04.039]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:32:04.039 --> 03:32:11.363]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:32:14.383 --> 03:32:19.825]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:32:19.825 --> 03:32:23.146]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:32:23.146 --> 03:32:26.267]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:32:26.267 --> 03:32:27.428]  Most people have no idea.
[03:32:27.428 --> 03:32:28.208]  They're not after money.
[03:32:28.208 --> 03:32:29.489]  They have all the money they need.
[03:32:29.489 --> 03:32:30.469]  They're after power.
[03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:31.629]  That's what they're after, New Zealand.
[03:32:31.629 --> 03:32:35.771]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[03:32:36.331 --> 03:32:38.251]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[03:32:38.251 --> 03:32:41.092]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
[03:32:41.092 --> 03:32:41.912]  You're the pretender!
[03:32:41.912 --> 03:32:47.093]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[03:32:47.093 --> 03:32:53.535]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[03:32:53.535 --> 03:33:02.376]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
[03:33:02.376 --> 03:33:05.057]  You're the pretender!
[03:33:11.747 --> 03:33:14.408]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[03:33:14.408 --> 03:33:20.369]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[03:33:20.369 --> 03:33:23.270]  Yeah, Silica Stillo is a real hero.
[03:33:23.270 --> 03:33:25.351]  And he had commendations from two presidents.
[03:33:25.351 --> 03:33:26.951]  He was going way up the chain.
[03:33:26.951 --> 03:33:32.032]  And then he witnessed the death squads, the people he was training, the government drug dealing.
[03:33:32.032 --> 03:33:33.973]  He wrote letters to the presidents.
[03:33:33.973 --> 03:33:35.073]  He was told to shut up.
[03:33:35.825 --> 03:33:37.646]  It's like Terry Reid in the CIA.
[03:33:37.646 --> 03:33:41.108]  He was just mid-level training pilots and kind of running part of the airport.
[03:33:41.108 --> 03:33:42.429]  And they'd be unloading cocaine.
[03:33:42.429 --> 03:33:43.989]  He's like, what the hell is this, man?
[03:33:43.989 --> 03:33:46.591]  They're like, come on, you've been involved in Vietnam and everything.
[03:33:46.591 --> 03:33:47.371]  You know what goes on.
[03:33:47.371 --> 03:33:52.294]  He's like, yeah, but I'm not going to be part of this.
[03:33:52.294 --> 03:33:54.575]  I mean, that's how these people operate.
[03:33:54.575 --> 03:33:59.158]  And then the SWAT team in your house and all these cops get killed fighting the drug war.
[03:33:59.158 --> 03:34:00.919]  But what are they going to do?
[03:34:00.919 --> 03:34:03.480]  We got millions of cops now, millions of bureaucrats.
[03:34:04.770 --> 03:34:08.435]  Millions of people in prison, they gotta do something!
[03:34:08.435 --> 03:34:09.736]  We gotta make a deal with the cops.
[03:34:09.736 --> 03:34:12.159]  Look, we'll let you have two million cops like there are.
[03:34:12.159 --> 03:34:15.804]  We'll just pay you paychecks and go drink lemonade.
[03:34:15.804 --> 03:34:17.425]  I mean, they just don't hurt us anymore.
[03:34:17.425 --> 03:34:21.170]  I mean, they already, the more cops we get, they won't come to your house when you're robbed.
[03:34:21.170 --> 03:34:21.791]  Have you noticed that?
[03:34:23.988 --> 03:34:29.533]  Back when I was a kid and there was 250,000 cops, then it was 300,000, then it was a million, then two million.
[03:34:29.533 --> 03:34:30.394]  Man, something happened.
[03:34:30.394 --> 03:34:33.797]  The cops were there in five minutes and they were, oh, we're going to investigate this.
[03:34:33.797 --> 03:34:35.378]  They were actual officers.
[03:34:35.378 --> 03:34:36.920]  Were they corrupt?
[03:34:36.920 --> 03:34:37.260]  Yes.
[03:34:37.260 --> 03:34:38.061]  Were they perfect?
[03:34:38.061 --> 03:34:38.621]  No.
[03:34:38.621 --> 03:34:40.243]  But most of them were good.
[03:34:40.243 --> 03:34:43.546]  It is not that way now.
[03:34:43.546 --> 03:34:46.328]  I can't get a cop out to my house if it gets burglarized.
[03:34:46.328 --> 03:34:48.310]  I can't get a cop when my car gets stolen.
[03:34:49.693 --> 03:34:51.074]  But you know what, ladies and gentlemen?
[03:34:51.074 --> 03:34:58.339]  You pull over on the side of the road and try to urinate, they'll take you to jail for exposing yourself.
[03:34:58.339 --> 03:35:02.201]  You, uh... Everybody I know isn't speeding now.
[03:35:02.201 --> 03:35:04.403]  They just get pulled over and they want to search your car.
[03:35:04.403 --> 03:35:09.066]  All these emails are pouring in where you'll just be in a shopping mall parking lot and they'll just stop everybody and search them.
[03:35:09.066 --> 03:35:10.467]  Or on the road.
[03:35:10.467 --> 03:35:11.828]  They're just searching us.
[03:35:11.828 --> 03:35:12.608]  It's in the news.
[03:35:12.608 --> 03:35:15.891]  They're running these martial law drills.
[03:35:15.891 --> 03:35:17.832]  I said I was going to news blitz and I'm already ranting.
[03:35:20.347 --> 03:35:25.330]  Okay, here is the stacks of news that I have.
[03:35:25.330 --> 03:35:37.638]  And there is a lot of it, and so I am just going to go through it as fast as I can.
[03:35:37.638 --> 03:35:39.539]  Oh my gosh, where to start?
[03:35:39.539 --> 03:35:40.219]  Where to begin?
[03:35:40.219 --> 03:35:43.201]  Oh man.
[03:35:43.201 --> 03:35:49.185]  This is the stack of what I have not covered yet.
[03:35:50.452 --> 03:35:52.294]  Good God.
[03:35:52.294 --> 03:35:53.815]  Probably 60 articles.
[03:35:53.815 --> 03:35:55.677]  Okay.
[03:35:55.677 --> 03:35:59.180]  Let's just go ahead and give you the brief version of what's going on.
[03:35:59.180 --> 03:36:03.945]  Christina Todd Whitman, not liable for telling residents the World Trade Center error was safe to breathe.
[03:36:03.945 --> 03:36:07.108]  Judge Rules, Associated Press, and I will just give you the backstory.
[03:36:07.108 --> 03:36:07.829]  You can Google this.
[03:36:08.763 --> 03:36:26.614]  They knew day one it was deadly and the White House ordered her to lie day two when she sent a memo saying it's deadly, asbestos, concrete, toxins, the meters are off the charts, it's a chemical disaster and they were ordered to lie and say it was good and she is not liable.
[03:36:26.614 --> 03:36:30.877]  That is Associated Press.
[03:36:30.877 --> 03:36:31.657]  Okay.
[03:36:31.657 --> 03:36:33.378]  That is one article.
[03:36:33.378 --> 03:36:35.660]  Behind TV analyst Pentagon's hidden hand
[03:36:37.026 --> 03:36:48.982]  This is a New York Times whitewash, but admitting that every one of the military analysts is on the Pentagon payroll or control, lying to the public.
[03:36:48.982 --> 03:36:51.525]  There that is for you in the video cam.
[03:36:51.525 --> 03:36:54.930]  Recapping, I had Dr. Ibrahim Dramali
[03:36:55.769 --> 03:37:01.774]  On the show today, talking about how it looked like he'd been tortured and murdered by the local Palestinian activist and thrown in the river.
[03:37:01.774 --> 03:37:06.598]  Unbelievable, that's about to retransmit when the show restarts feeding on the internet.
[03:37:06.598 --> 03:37:09.020]  Unbelievable first hour coming up.
[03:37:09.020 --> 03:37:13.744]  Unbelievable second hour coming up in about 25 minutes.
[03:37:13.744 --> 03:37:18.207]  Oh, let's get technical, 22 and a half.
[03:37:18.207 --> 03:37:22.371]  Colorado lawmaker removed from podium over Mexican's remark, even though I disagree with his,
[03:37:23.163 --> 03:37:23.583]  Remark.
[03:37:23.583 --> 03:37:24.764]  He shouldn't be removed.
[03:37:24.764 --> 03:37:26.264]  That's a violation of free speech.
[03:37:26.264 --> 03:37:30.106]  Colorado legislature, known for kicking a photographer, was ordered to leave the podium.
[03:37:30.106 --> 03:37:34.807]  The state House of Representatives on Monday because he called Mexican workers illiterate peasants.
[03:37:34.807 --> 03:37:38.749]  Now, I don't know if that's an unmean way to say it, but they do get free health care, free everything.
[03:37:38.749 --> 03:37:40.129]  They are above the law, like the police.
[03:37:40.129 --> 03:37:42.210]  They don't get a reserve for DWI.
[03:37:42.210 --> 03:37:43.791]  And they are illiterate peasants.
[03:37:43.791 --> 03:37:46.032]  That's what the Mexican government calls them.
[03:37:46.032 --> 03:37:47.332]  But I don't agree with the way he did it.
[03:37:47.332 --> 03:37:48.072]  He should have.
[03:37:48.072 --> 03:37:51.354]  But if you actually read the quote, they took it a little bit out of context.
[03:37:55.959 --> 03:38:02.925]  He said, I would like to have the opportunity to state at the microphone why I don't think we need 5,000 more illiterate peasants in Colorado, Bruce said.
[03:38:02.925 --> 03:38:03.906]  They call it an outburst.
[03:38:03.906 --> 03:38:07.890]  Well, the point is, it could have been more tactfully done, but everything is bankrupting.
[03:38:07.890 --> 03:38:22.383]  I mean, there was an article in Washington Post about how illegals get tens of thousands of free liver, heart, kidney transplants and go to the head of the line, because you can't discriminate, so they have to go to the head of the line.
[03:38:24.443 --> 03:38:27.927]  Told you when my finger was cut off I couldn't get service, but the illegals could.
[03:38:27.927 --> 03:38:29.288]  That's the Bush's war.
[03:38:29.288 --> 03:38:33.813]  Suvea, more than half wounded troops slipping through the cracks.
[03:38:33.813 --> 03:38:37.857]  Alternet not getting treatment.
[03:38:37.857 --> 03:38:41.301]  Summit renamed to defend North American Union critics.
[03:38:42.088 --> 03:38:45.651]  Bush and Mexican-Canadian leaders in New Orleans for 4th Annual Meeting.
[03:38:45.651 --> 03:38:58.342]  As the 4th Annual Summit of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America begins in New Orleans, White House is engaging in public relations campaign to reposition the meeting away from the controversial issue of continued continental integration.
[03:38:58.342 --> 03:39:00.384]  Build instead the North American Leaders Summit.
[03:39:00.384 --> 03:39:01.085]  They've changed it.
[03:39:01.852 --> 03:39:14.019]  The meeting appears designed to create photo opportunities showing President Bush from Mexico's President Felipe Calderon and Canadian's Prime Minister Stephen Harper rather than emphasize the Trilateral Cooperation, the centerpiece of the previous SPP summits.
[03:39:14.019 --> 03:39:23.065]  They've got their own documents where they admit that they are merging all of this and say they've got to keep it secret from us and then it's a North American Union.
[03:39:23.065 --> 03:39:31.470]  That's the September 22nd to 24th BAMF Canada lawsuit documents available at judicialwatch.gov.
[03:39:32.228 --> 03:39:34.429]  Org.
[03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:35.049]  There is that.
[03:39:35.049 --> 03:39:40.171]  Kind of like Dinecore changed his name after he got caught running giant child kidnapping rings.
[03:39:40.171 --> 03:39:42.011]  By the way, you can't make stuff up like that.
[03:39:42.011 --> 03:39:42.611]  Go look into it.
[03:39:42.611 --> 03:39:43.592]  Find out it's true.
[03:39:43.592 --> 03:39:46.913]  I know you're a cop laughing in your car, but that's who you work for, okay?
[03:39:46.913 --> 03:39:50.494]  Go look it up and then cry your guts out and realize you work for Satan himself, okay?
[03:39:50.494 --> 03:39:51.794]  It's all over.
[03:39:51.794 --> 03:39:53.015]  I'm surprised I'm even alive.
[03:39:53.015 --> 03:39:54.955]  I thank God every day.
[03:39:54.955 --> 03:39:57.196]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:39:57.196 --> 03:40:00.417]  Food rationing confronts breadbasket of the world.
[03:40:01.440 --> 03:40:07.184]  AP and everybody else are reporting, I got a stack of these from yesterday, I never even got to, that food rationing's already begun.
[03:40:07.184 --> 03:40:10.166]  Lots of food, you'll notice, isn't on store shelves now.
[03:40:10.166 --> 03:40:13.829]  Staples, corn, wheat, bread, things that it's involved with.
[03:40:13.829 --> 03:40:16.491]  The prices are up 40 percent, exploding.
[03:40:16.491 --> 03:40:17.732]  Everything we told you would happen.
[03:40:18.572 --> 03:40:22.215]  Because the dollar is plunging in value and there's problems worldwide.
[03:40:22.215 --> 03:40:26.037]  Big Agra is engineering this collapse.
[03:40:26.037 --> 03:40:40.066]  Kurt Nimmo wrote a detailed article about that last night with all their official UN documents on InfoWars.com if you want to actually know what they're doing.
[03:40:40.066 --> 03:40:42.387]  Olympic torch anti-freedom farce continues.
[03:40:42.387 --> 03:40:44.709]  Media ban from torch rally through nation's capital.
[03:40:45.640 --> 03:40:54.005]  In Australia, they are banning the media from covering the Olympic torch, where Chinese paramilitary forces have attacked U.S.
[03:40:54.005 --> 03:40:57.228]  citizens, British, French, and others.
[03:40:57.228 --> 03:40:58.148]  Unbelievable.
[03:40:58.148 --> 03:41:01.430]  Can't let the slaves know what's going on.
[03:41:01.430 --> 03:41:01.650]  U.S.
[03:41:01.650 --> 03:41:07.314]  military denies German citizen, detains German citizen in Afghanistan.
[03:41:07.314 --> 03:41:08.615]  Little report on that.
[03:41:08.615 --> 03:41:10.236]  Can't be there covering what's happening.
[03:41:12.535 --> 03:41:13.876]  And the suspicion of terrorism.
[03:41:13.876 --> 03:41:17.398]  The report is, though, that it's an aid group.
[03:41:17.398 --> 03:41:24.081]  Feds change policy, will now collect DNA from every person they arrest, and that means local police under federalization.
[03:41:24.081 --> 03:41:30.304]  And now you know why at checkpoints all over the country, they're taking blood and tissue out of your cheeks in the last year they've been doing it.
[03:41:30.304 --> 03:41:33.165]  Really, it goes back a decade, but now it's nationwide.
[03:41:33.165 --> 03:41:38.068]  They're now admitting, and by the way, I heard Gary Brownfield reading mainstream news today on the air, on the network,
[03:41:38.906 --> 03:41:40.446]  And I pulled it up, there it was.
[03:41:40.446 --> 03:41:44.827]  Mainstream News is now announcing that every baby at birth is put in a DNA database for the government.
[03:41:44.827 --> 03:41:47.588]  They don't tell you though that's been going on for 35 years criminally.
[03:41:47.588 --> 03:41:49.268]  The government is criminal.
[03:41:49.268 --> 03:41:51.048]  You understand?
[03:41:51.048 --> 03:41:53.669]  Feds change policy will now collect DNA from everybody.
[03:41:53.669 --> 03:41:59.010]  So they're basically now just whitewashing what they're doing.
[03:41:59.010 --> 03:42:02.810]  So they announce what they're doing decades after it's in place.
[03:42:02.810 --> 03:42:06.171]  New Jersey court requires subpoena for internet subscriber records.
[03:42:07.581 --> 03:42:14.487]  That's something attacking free speech on the web.
[03:42:14.487 --> 03:42:21.833]  There's a report up on PrisonPlanet.com about WeAreChange being provocateured and set up in New York, not just in Ireland.
[03:42:21.833 --> 03:42:29.079]  And that's also at WeAreChange.org right there.
[03:42:29.079 --> 03:42:33.022]  Groombell says financial system narrowly averted collapse.
[03:42:34.071 --> 03:42:38.272]  This is Oswald Grubel, well-known ex-CEO of Credit Suisse.
[03:42:38.272 --> 03:42:48.555]  The bank confirms in an interview given to Swiss newspaper, Sotensblock, that the world financial system was sharply near to collapse in mid-March.
[03:42:48.555 --> 03:42:54.397]  When Bear Stearns collapsed without intervention of the central banks, the system would have not survived.
[03:42:54.397 --> 03:43:03.059]  He compared the moment with the Cuba crisis, with the Cuban Missile Crisis, as I see it, the first time that an insider spoke so clearly about the dramatic situation
[03:43:04.761 --> 03:43:04.901]  Wow.
[03:43:04.901 --> 03:43:05.802]  So there is that.
[03:43:05.802 --> 03:43:07.483]  Border fence leaves rich and powerful untouched.
[03:43:07.483 --> 03:43:08.144]  The Texas Observer
[03:43:19.717 --> 03:43:22.798]  And, uh, it says that they are not really even building it.
[03:43:22.798 --> 03:43:29.699]  They're just using it piece by piece to grab people's property, then leaving large areas owned by rich people or special interest alone.
[03:43:29.699 --> 03:43:32.139]  Yeah, they're not... They've built, like, 40 miles of fence.
[03:43:32.139 --> 03:43:47.002]  They're supposed to have the whole thing built two years ago, and they only build it in selective areas, and they put openings in it for, quote, wildlife to go through, and then drainage ditches that a man can bend down only halfway and go right underneath.
[03:43:47.002 --> 03:43:48.282]  That story is, um...
[03:43:48.760 --> 03:43:51.421]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[03:43:51.421 --> 03:43:55.562]  In Florida, snooping cops disguise cameras as fire hydrants.
[03:43:55.562 --> 03:44:02.965]  Kurt Nemo gets into that and they just randomly surveil everyone saying that everyone could be terrorist.
[03:44:02.965 --> 03:44:06.766]  So, uh, that report is up there.
[03:44:06.766 --> 03:44:13.428]  Not getting into much detail here because this is the news that I do read in detail and then never have a chance to properly cover on air.
[03:44:13.428 --> 03:44:18.170]  Pipe down, Brussels slaps a noise order on the heart of Scotland.
[03:44:20.808 --> 03:44:21.268]  That's right.
[03:44:21.268 --> 03:44:27.233]  They're telling bus drivers they've got to stop every 25 miles, get everybody off to walk for their health.
[03:44:27.233 --> 03:44:30.436]  They're saying you can't use pounds at your grocery stores, you'll be arrested.
[03:44:30.436 --> 03:44:31.276]  People are.
[03:44:31.276 --> 03:44:34.038]  They're saying what speech you can and can't have.
[03:44:34.038 --> 03:44:37.101]  It's all about the EU showing England how they're under their control.
[03:44:37.865 --> 03:44:40.125]  England always swore they'd allow a vote on it.
[03:44:40.125 --> 03:44:40.746]  Doesn't matter.
[03:44:40.746 --> 03:44:44.826]  They signed the EU Court Agreement.
[03:44:44.826 --> 03:44:46.707]  Now they're under EU tyranny.
[03:44:46.707 --> 03:44:50.467]  Pipe down, Brussels slaps a noise order on the heart of Scotland.
[03:44:50.467 --> 03:44:57.209]  Their high-pitched shrill has put fear into the hearts of Scotland's enemies and sensitive tourists reaching for the cotton wool.
[03:44:57.209 --> 03:44:58.889]  Well, I love the sound of bagpipes.
[03:44:58.889 --> 03:45:04.530]  Now, however, the bagpipes are to be quieted by an edict from Brussels.
[03:45:05.464 --> 03:45:11.449]  From this month on, pipers will adhere to strict volume limits or risk breaking European Union health and safety rules.
[03:45:11.449 --> 03:45:20.336]  Now remember, the European Union allows the mosquito system ultra-low frequency that actually damages your ears to be put out in city streets to quote, keep kids from congregating.
[03:45:20.336 --> 03:45:23.418]  They can damage your ears, but oh, you can't have bagpipes.
[03:45:23.418 --> 03:45:28.302]  They pick things that sound ridiculous to set these precedents.
[03:45:28.302 --> 03:45:33.927]  They can make you do something dumb like take your shoes off or be strict search at the airport or not carry shampoo on.
[03:45:34.861 --> 03:45:37.023]  Or have checkpoints on the highway without warrants.
[03:45:37.023 --> 03:45:38.804]  You'll accept anything.
[03:45:38.804 --> 03:45:42.147]  So now they're saying that they are banning bagpipes.
[03:45:42.147 --> 03:45:45.550]  They're also saying they're not allowed to use the particular wood out of Africa.
[03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:46.811]  They're trying to ban it there.
[03:45:46.811 --> 03:45:52.035]  They attack cultural icons to set precedence, because if you'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[03:45:52.035 --> 03:45:57.120]  Classic Pavlovian conditioning, hardcore behavioral psychology, black-op attack.
[03:45:57.120 --> 03:46:00.322]  There's that article, Times of London.
[03:46:00.322 --> 03:46:01.143]  Not playing games.
[03:46:03.268 --> 03:46:05.830]  AT&T serves notice.
[03:46:05.830 --> 03:46:08.872]  Internet has three years before it faces board assimilation.
[03:46:08.872 --> 03:46:20.721]  Kurt Nemo, Infowars.com, he has their own statements about how they're going to shut down the old web, make you go on the new web, where you have to pay much more, and where there's no freedom of speech, because you'll have subdomains on their sites.
[03:46:20.721 --> 03:46:26.586]  So all of those busy on the message boards at Infowars, where we let you do it unless you slander or threaten people to kill them,
[03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:32.932]  We also have people that would go on there and threaten themselves, and then say, how dare you not kick them off?
[03:46:32.932 --> 03:46:37.094]  We traced the IP, it was the same guys, so we do kick some people off, but it's pretty wild.
[03:46:37.094 --> 03:46:42.037]  You can do pretty much what you want there, as long as it's serious, and not kill this person, kill that person.
[03:46:42.037 --> 03:46:45.258]  We've already had the Secret Service drop by, so nice try, guys.
[03:46:45.258 --> 03:46:47.099]  We tracked it back to you.
[03:46:47.099 --> 03:46:49.580]  So that's why that's going on there.
[03:46:49.580 --> 03:46:52.542]  But... Oh, you didn't know about that?
[03:46:52.542 --> 03:46:54.943]  Yeah, that happened.
[03:46:54.943 --> 03:46:55.123]  AT&T,
[03:46:58.104 --> 03:46:59.907]  Again, that's how they're shutting it down.
[03:46:59.907 --> 03:47:01.750]  It's called Internet 2.
[03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:04.554]  Funding worries Fusion Center officials.
[03:47:04.554 --> 03:47:09.462]  Another unfunded mandate by the federal government.
[03:47:10.700 --> 03:47:17.244]  In the late 90s, they built emergency management centers in rural areas, in four and five county areas, in big cities.
[03:47:17.244 --> 03:47:20.986]  They made the citizens pay for it with unfunded mandates locally.
[03:47:20.986 --> 03:47:26.450]  They integrate the police under federal control to run checkpoints, martial law sweeps in their own words.
[03:47:26.450 --> 03:47:28.391]  But now the feds aren't even going to pay for any of it.
[03:47:28.391 --> 03:47:30.692]  We've got to all pay for it ourselves.
[03:47:30.692 --> 03:47:35.055]  So just another tax of Big Brother there for you.
[03:47:36.093 --> 03:47:42.398]  That's out of FCW.com, a big site that attracts government, a federal computer weekly.
[03:47:42.398 --> 03:47:42.618]  U.S.
[03:47:42.618 --> 03:47:45.240]  military targets southwest Colorado.
[03:47:45.240 --> 03:47:49.704]  They're busy land-grabbing, shoving around whoever they want, doing whatever they want.
[03:47:49.704 --> 03:47:52.406]  That's out of New America.
[03:47:52.406 --> 03:47:56.429]  Food rationing begins in America, KPTM television.
[03:47:56.429 --> 03:48:04.015]  Food shortages and rationing have been a third-world problem as of late, but recently the phenomenon
[03:48:04.819 --> 03:48:07.380]  Once thought unthinkable in the United States, could start happening.
[03:48:07.380 --> 03:48:15.245]  The New York Sun paper is reporting that major retailers of both coasts are limiting consumers' purchase of flour, rice, and cooking oil.
[03:48:15.245 --> 03:48:19.047]  The Sun reports that Costco warehouse in California ran out of rice.
[03:48:19.047 --> 03:48:20.047]  Frustrating shoppers.
[03:48:20.047 --> 03:48:20.808]  Where's the rice?
[03:48:20.808 --> 03:48:24.430]  An engineer from Palo Alto, California said you should be able to buy something like rice.
[03:48:24.430 --> 03:48:25.470]  This is ridiculous.
[03:48:25.470 --> 03:48:26.691]  Not in the new global system.
[03:48:26.691 --> 03:48:29.953]  You reach State Department, memorandum 200, and all their other official documents.
[03:48:29.953 --> 03:48:32.394]  This is all stated by them.
[03:48:32.394 --> 03:48:34.055]  And Richard Inhas, head of the CFR,
[03:48:34.824 --> 03:48:35.084]  We're good.
[03:48:51.642 --> 03:48:56.625]  ...system to, quote, wage war on humans by the elite.
[03:48:56.625 --> 03:49:01.729]  Public stated, as I told you, and then somebody found their own documents where they said exactly what I'm saying.
[03:49:01.729 --> 03:49:02.669]  I mean, it's not hard.
[03:49:02.669 --> 03:49:04.671]  It's a public attack pattern.
[03:49:04.671 --> 03:49:06.732]  This whole anti-terror thing is for you.
[03:49:06.732 --> 03:49:15.758]  The whole environmental deal is to restrict and tax and control you while they engage in total environmental Armageddon with the genetic engineering and the rest of it.
[03:49:15.758 --> 03:49:17.879]  The fish infusion, cyclotrons, all of it.
[03:49:17.879 --> 03:49:18.600]  It's just insane.
[03:49:19.633 --> 03:49:22.275]  If you don't know what cyclotrons are, you better find out, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:49:22.275 --> 03:49:24.997]  Food shortages or globalist depopulation agenda.
[03:49:24.997 --> 03:49:28.920]  This is the key article that Nemo did yesterday, and he spent hours doing this.
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:30.441]  You ought to go read it.
[03:49:30.441 --> 03:49:33.784]  Food shortages or globalist depopulation agenda.
[03:49:33.784 --> 03:49:34.605]  Continuing.
[03:49:34.605 --> 03:49:36.586]  Recycling cops freak out residents.
[03:49:36.586 --> 03:49:39.468]  This has already happened in England, where they have tracker chips that track you.
[03:49:39.468 --> 03:49:43.111]  They check to make sure you're putting your bottles and things in there, or they fine and fee you.
[03:49:43.111 --> 03:49:44.632]  Uh, there you go.
[03:49:44.632 --> 03:49:46.594]  Recycling cops freak out.
[03:49:48.192 --> 03:49:51.313]  Residents, ah yes, the new EnviroSpies.
[03:49:51.313 --> 03:49:55.974]  They have all these white papers written where you think CPS is bad and the cops are bad.
[03:49:55.974 --> 03:49:59.474]  They're going to have EnviroCops home inspections every month.
[03:49:59.474 --> 03:50:03.035]  I mean, how big your house can be, any changes in your home.
[03:50:03.035 --> 03:50:04.836]  Just hell on earth, folks.
[03:50:04.836 --> 03:50:06.736]  Just absolute total control.
[03:50:06.736 --> 03:50:09.157]  Just unthinkable.
[03:50:09.157 --> 03:50:13.738]  Metals, gold rises on weak dollar, oil goes to all-time high.
[03:50:13.738 --> 03:50:15.118]  There is that for you.
[03:50:16.469 --> 03:50:27.315]  We are changed to release assault videos as someone running around waving signs saying that We Are Changed did the bombing of the recruiting center wearing Hitler mustache.
[03:50:27.315 --> 03:50:28.936]  I mean, this is just all these people.
[03:50:28.936 --> 03:50:31.177]  A lot of you are sucked into this no-plane thing.
[03:50:31.177 --> 03:50:31.777]  You don't understand.
[03:50:31.777 --> 03:50:33.458]  It's a total black-off.
[03:50:33.458 --> 03:50:35.699]  I saw it coming a mile away.
[03:50:35.699 --> 03:50:40.201]  Final segment totally jam-packed with documents and articles on the other side.
[03:50:40.201 --> 03:50:41.862]  Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:50:41.862 --> 03:50:42.363]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:50:46.434 --> 03:50:51.517]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[03:50:51.517 --> 03:50:55.400]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[03:50:55.400 --> 03:51:05.086]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.

[03:51:23.618 --> 03:51:28.722]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.

[03:51:53.085 --> 03:51:54.866]  He gets uptight so easily.
[03:51:54.866 --> 03:51:55.546]  I know.
[03:51:55.546 --> 03:51:58.787]  My Gary has high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[03:51:58.787 --> 03:52:00.988]  I always think about the what if.
[03:52:00.988 --> 03:52:01.809]  I know.
[03:52:01.809 --> 03:52:05.310]  Ladies, you need to get your husband's Coco Pure Chocolate Tea.
[03:52:05.310 --> 03:52:06.331]  Chocolate tea?
[03:52:06.331 --> 03:52:07.471]  That sounds delicious.
[03:52:07.471 --> 03:52:09.412]  The information is all over the news.
[03:52:09.412 --> 03:52:14.374]  Coco without the high fat and an extract from red wine are both shown to have heart benefits.
[03:52:14.654 --> 03:52:16.278]  See, I told you chocolate was good for us!

[03:54:10.777 --> 03:54:13.918]  We got some big guests coming up this week on the show and next week.
[03:54:13.918 --> 03:54:16.078]  I'm just going to give you a fair warning.
[03:54:16.078 --> 03:54:18.239]  Burmas will be filling in Thursday.
[03:54:18.239 --> 03:54:19.379]  I got four guests.
[03:54:19.379 --> 03:54:22.220]  Two of them are huge on Friday.
[03:54:22.220 --> 03:54:23.300]  Big guests next week.
[03:54:23.300 --> 03:54:29.222]  A lot of other surprises for you, the viewers and the listeners.
[03:54:29.222 --> 03:54:31.942]  Sheriffs back three jails for illegal immigrants.
[03:54:31.942 --> 03:54:34.703]  News 19 sounds reasonable in Myrtle Beach.
[03:54:35.484 --> 03:54:42.007]  When you read, it's federally funded, locally run prisons for illegal aliens and terrorists.
[03:54:42.007 --> 03:54:44.107]  And they have a few of these for shows.
[03:54:44.107 --> 03:54:45.928]  They have one outside Austin.
[03:54:45.928 --> 03:54:48.069]  They mainly just harass Arabs and a few other people.
[03:54:48.069 --> 03:54:51.110]  The illegals have been caught literally cleaning the prison.
[03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:55.852]  It's like illegals were caught building the border prison under the border fence.
[03:54:55.852 --> 03:54:58.113]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:54:58.113 --> 03:55:00.093]  So there is that article.
[03:55:00.093 --> 03:55:04.035]  That's the problem, is that this is, again, all staged.
[03:55:05.157 --> 03:55:08.159]  Very sophisticated, the people that run things.
[03:55:08.159 --> 03:55:08.839]  50% of L.A.
[03:55:08.839 --> 03:55:11.140]  workforce are immigrants, UPI.
[03:55:11.140 --> 03:55:14.282]  And the problem is, I've talked to people that are chefs there, black, white.
[03:55:14.282 --> 03:55:16.203]  If you're not a Mexican, you don't get hired now.
[03:55:16.203 --> 03:55:20.906]  They'll run you out of the dry-cleaning business.
[03:55:20.906 --> 03:55:21.686]  And this is what's happening.
[03:55:21.686 --> 03:55:22.447]  This is racism.
[03:55:22.447 --> 03:55:25.388]  I'm not saying all Hispanics do this, but the La Rican pieces do.
[03:55:25.388 --> 03:55:26.909]  Especially in L.A.
[03:55:26.909 --> 03:55:29.551]  You're not allowed, you can't work in the restaurant.
[03:55:29.551 --> 03:55:32.992]  You can't work in custodial services.
[03:55:32.992 --> 03:55:33.353]  And it's...
[03:55:36.440 --> 03:55:37.040]  50% of L.A.
[03:55:37.040 --> 03:55:39.061]  workforce are immigrants.
[03:55:39.061 --> 03:55:43.864]  And of course, 75% of the children there, more than half the children in Texas are.
[03:55:43.864 --> 03:55:45.985]  And the problem is, they're not being taught to love this country.
[03:55:45.985 --> 03:55:49.766]  They're being taught by the Ford Foundation that this is Mexico.
[03:55:49.766 --> 03:55:52.928]  Also, oil, as I mentioned, goes record above 118 a barrel.
[03:55:52.928 --> 03:55:55.289]  There's the actual number on that.
[03:55:55.289 --> 03:55:56.990]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[03:55:57.606 --> 03:55:59.067]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:55:59.067 --> 03:56:02.650]  Disney launching unit to make environmental films for children.
[03:56:02.650 --> 03:56:05.332]  AP, this will be shown in schools everywhere.
[03:56:05.332 --> 03:56:11.957]  All about worshipping Gaia, giving your rights up, hating humanity, making humans the enemy, in the words of the chairman of the CFR.
[03:56:11.957 --> 03:56:17.101]  But of course, an enemy the government, the Pentagon are willing to deal with.
[03:56:17.101 --> 03:56:19.123]  Oh yes, their eugenics program.
[03:56:19.123 --> 03:56:21.865]  So there's the Disney launching unit to make environmental films.
[03:56:23.405 --> 03:56:27.187]  More convicted felons allowed to enlist in Army and the Marines.
[03:56:27.187 --> 03:56:28.727]  That's ABC News.
[03:56:28.727 --> 03:56:34.510]  I have another AP article on this as well.
[03:56:34.510 --> 03:56:36.571]  And they only give you a small percentage of them.
[03:56:36.571 --> 03:56:49.236]  I remember eight years ago seeing in Washington papers, Washington Times, Washington Post with a report, and they said it was very good of course, you can pull them up, that aggravated felons who were illegal aliens were being hired out of the prisons.
[03:56:49.236 --> 03:56:52.158]  And I still get emails saying, I'm making this up, here is AP
[03:56:53.368 --> 03:56:55.509]  Or if you'd rather have that.
[03:56:55.509 --> 03:57:00.212]  Also, surgeons give hope to blind with successful bionic eye operation.
[03:57:00.212 --> 03:57:02.133]  They're able to give people sight now.
[03:57:02.133 --> 03:57:12.218]  It's not as good as regular sight, but it will be soon, and it's just amazing and wonderful, and this is why the elite want to kill 80% of us or more, because they don't want the general public having access to all of this.
[03:57:12.218 --> 03:57:18.822]  It's a revolution they're trying to suppress, and they use homeland security and the global tyranny to suppress all the real technologies that have been developed.
[03:57:20.503 --> 03:57:23.425]  Bank of America net income falls 75%.
[03:57:23.425 --> 03:57:24.885]  They're in deep trouble.
[03:57:24.885 --> 03:57:30.368]  That's Bloomberg Financial for you.
[03:57:30.368 --> 03:57:31.749]  Tony Snow to go to CNN.
[03:57:31.749 --> 03:57:32.389]  Who cares?
[03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:35.191]  Sending Marines to recruit women.
[03:57:35.191 --> 03:57:37.832]  Japan's hunger becomes a dire warning for other nations.
[03:57:37.832 --> 03:57:40.113]  Major food shortages in Japan.
[03:57:40.113 --> 03:57:43.395]  I am out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:57:44.683 --> 03:57:47.586]  I hope that you will all join me live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:57:47.586 --> 03:57:48.667]  to 3 p.m.
[03:57:48.667 --> 03:57:50.128]  here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[03:57:50.128 --> 03:57:59.816]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members who subscribe, who get the live video cam feeds, document cams, the rest of it, and get it archived within a few hours of the show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:57:59.816 --> 03:58:01.097]  If you don't have a membership, think about it.
[03:58:01.097 --> 03:58:07.062]  I want to thank the folks in here running the show in Texas, John Harmon up in Minnesota running it from that end.
[03:58:07.062 --> 03:58:09.664]  I just want to commend everybody and thank you.
[03:58:09.664 --> 03:58:12.567]  My first and second hour today were unbelievably important.

[03:58:36.212 --> 03:58:39.455]  The election cycle draws near, and we don't have much time left.
[03:58:39.455 --> 03:58:46.363]  If the American people truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now with a cohesive plan for taking back our government.
[03:58:46.363 --> 03:58:50.747]  Washington You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason.
[03:58:50.747 --> 03:58:55.312]  The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging
[03:58:55.652 --> 03:59:00.136]  Educating and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[03:59:00.136 --> 03:59:08.182]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[03:59:08.182 --> 03:59:12.965]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with only two choices.
[03:59:12.965 --> 03:59:15.887]  Be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.
[03:59:15.887 --> 03:59:23.153]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since Freedom to Fascism and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
[03:59:23.713 --> 03:59:25.394]  We invite you to make the change.
