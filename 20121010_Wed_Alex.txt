[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:34.400]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[00:34.400 --> 00:41.160]  my friends it is Wednesday the 10th day of October 2012 I'm your host alex jones
[00:41.160 --> 00:46.680]  we're going to be here for the next three hours wow there is so much to go
[00:46.680 --> 00:54.400]  over here and we're going to be breaking it all down today but China's economy is
[00:54.400 --> 00:59.440]  melting down faster and faster in fact I had that in my stack of news and then
[00:59.440 --> 01:03.000]  right before the show started just about two minutes ago I was getting a cup of
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.920]  coffee back in the break room and I had CNBC on and they were going let's be
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.600]  honest China's deteriorating fast with you know riots and the government's
[01:13.600 --> 01:18.000]  pumping in massive amounts of liquidity and now they have this dispute with
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.160]  Japan and threatening war and massive liquidity in Europe and here and then I
[01:23.160 --> 01:27.320]  had to walk out of the room to come down here but you just see it everywhere
[01:27.320 --> 01:36.160]  the the global collapse is accelerating and it is engineered and I don't want to
[01:36.160 --> 01:40.080]  just sit here like a deer in the headlights to me to be quite frank I
[01:40.080 --> 01:44.560]  was talking to my wife this morning and I said we're like deer in the headlights
[01:44.560 --> 01:48.400]  and we get up here on the air and we say everybody should get motivated and
[01:48.400 --> 01:52.640]  everybody should take action and everybody should expose the corrupt
[01:52.640 --> 01:58.200]  government we've got and say no to tyranny but I feel like I'm not doing
[01:58.200 --> 02:02.400]  enough or that I'm not finding that magic lever to throw that turns all this
[02:02.400 --> 02:05.920]  around and then I just realized that historically we're entering a very
[02:05.920 --> 02:12.120]  decadent cycle right now and we're going to go through this the question is how
[02:12.120 --> 02:20.160]  bad is it going to be and the more people we wake up the the better it's
[02:20.160 --> 02:25.920]  going to be the pain will not be as great and not as prolonged historically
[02:25.920 --> 02:33.720]  but it is quite a realization to have been on the air for 17 years really
[02:33.720 --> 02:37.720]  about 13 years trying to stop this engineered global meltdown that we knew
[02:37.720 --> 02:43.320]  they were setting up then and to now know that it's not going to be stopped
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.200]  they're going to start their larger war in the Middle East it's already begun
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.520]  they're going to attack Iran the question is when they're going to
[02:51.520 --> 02:55.880]  establish pretty much martial law in the Western world and they're going to
[02:55.880 --> 02:58.600]  raise the taxes and take everybody's private property unless you're an
[02:58.600 --> 03:05.040]  insider and armies of bureaucrats and corporate bureaucrats are already
[03:05.040 --> 03:12.560]  engaged in their criminal activities all around us and the general public is in
[03:12.560 --> 03:22.960]  a trance-like state obsessed with what Lady Gaga is doing and we are a rotten
[03:22.960 --> 03:30.600]  corrupt decadent system from the elite at the top right down to the general
[03:30.600 --> 03:36.040]  public myself included you know a shadow of the type of men that founded
[03:36.040 --> 03:41.800]  Texas a shadow of the type of people that founded this Republic and I've
[03:41.800 --> 03:46.640]  studied the history I don't romanticize it I am a shadow of those men and the
[03:46.640 --> 03:52.360]  general public is a shadow of who I am that's pretty scary when you know that
[03:52.360 --> 03:59.000]  you're low and weak and you're better than almost everybody and the globalist
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.320]  are fully aware of all this and they're rolling forward and they know it's a
[04:04.320 --> 04:09.280]  collapse of their institutionalizing cycles and using the natural cycle to
[04:09.280 --> 04:14.800]  accelerate it to control it like a spacecraft going around a gas giant to
[04:14.800 --> 04:18.640]  pick up acceleration to slingshot to light speed and I don't think they're
[04:18.640 --> 04:22.960]  gonna execute it in fact historically and electrically I can look at this
[04:22.960 --> 04:27.400]  spiritually I can look at this gut level I can look at this and tell you the
[04:27.400 --> 04:30.840]  globalists are gonna destroy themselves and us if we don't stop them so right
[04:30.840 --> 04:36.680]  now I just hope to survive this collapse and this decadent frothing we're going
[04:36.680 --> 04:41.200]  to witness that's gonna make anything in history look like a cakewalk and
[04:41.200 --> 04:44.720]  hopefully have a remnant of human civilization continue on to the future
[04:44.720 --> 04:47.760]  and I've just got to go ahead and just tell you that's where I see things going
[04:47.760 --> 04:51.680]  I don't think there's any way to stop it at this point okay there you go maybe
[04:51.680 --> 04:56.040]  I'm wrong I've tried to be an optimist but this this country in this world is a
[04:56.040 --> 05:03.000]  rotten hog in the sun the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.680]  months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn
[05:07.680 --> 05:12.040]  belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[05:12.040 --> 05:16.120]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[05:16.120 --> 05:19.400]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[05:19.400 --> 05:23.920]  the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[05:23.920 --> 05:28.120]  by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw
[05:28.120 --> 05:31.920]  ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to

[09:11.040 --> 09:15.720]  you don't cheat or screw anybody and not have it come back on you and the
[09:15.720 --> 09:20.360]  social engineers we have running our society are as wicked and out of
[09:20.360 --> 09:24.520]  control and destructive as the day is long and the only reason they've been
[09:24.520 --> 09:28.800]  successful the globalist taking over the world to a great extent is because
[09:28.800 --> 09:36.080]  good men and women have done little or nothing to resist them and many people
[09:36.080 --> 09:39.920]  that are good who've gotten involved have been diverted by the globalist into
[09:39.920 --> 09:45.080]  their own programs which on the surface say they're have a good goal in mind but
[09:45.080 --> 09:52.120]  always at its heart have dependency centralization and brutality at its
[09:52.120 --> 09:57.800]  heart okay wow every day it's an overload before I go on air looking at all
[09:57.800 --> 10:03.160]  the news but let me just try to give you a smattering of what I'm here looking at
[10:03.160 --> 10:09.600]  Switzerland prepares for mass civil unrest in Europe fears over race wars
[10:09.600 --> 10:15.360]  economic fallout prompt new military battalions and this is the universities
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.240]  the government elected officials they're all here quoted out of the Swiss
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.600]  newspapers Paul Watson quotes them and links to where they're making these
[10:24.600 --> 10:29.880]  statements and it's on Swiss television it's in the Swiss papers they're
[10:29.880 --> 10:36.000]  preparing for basically road warrior level collapse of Europe and of course
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.480]  the elites in Europe are also preparing in other countries and they're preparing
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.840]  here while starting wars all over the world and trying to engineer a financial
[10:44.840 --> 10:50.400]  implosion we're going to be talking with best-selling author of when
[10:50.400 --> 10:57.480]  technology fails Matt Stein on this and more coming up in the second hour today
[10:57.480 --> 11:01.720]  so that's just one of the stories I have you remember three months ago there
[11:01.720 --> 11:08.400]  were no exaggeration over 500 news articles coming out and saying there are
[11:08.400 --> 11:12.160]  no drones watching you there is no weaponization of drones it doesn't
[11:12.160 --> 11:17.440]  exist Alex Jones that drudge drudge report dot com in full wars dot com was
[11:17.440 --> 11:21.400]  drudge carrying our stories we just made it up even though Curt Nemo's article
[11:21.400 --> 11:25.360]  that became the national you know huge news story that they countered was linked
[11:25.360 --> 11:28.560]  to all these local articles where they had weaponized drones and we're
[11:28.560 --> 11:33.400]  weaponizing them and arresting people with them from Texas to Dakota to North
[11:33.400 --> 11:40.160]  Dakota so all of this is going on well here is another article today with NBC
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.360]  News and and we're going to play part of this later just to analyze it sheriff
[11:44.360 --> 11:53.640]  wants drones to peek inside buildings and this particular sheriff says in
[11:53.640 --> 11:58.400]  California that that he already has drones but now he wants them to look
[11:58.400 --> 12:03.760]  through your windows and to find marijuana plants and to track of what
[12:03.760 --> 12:10.360]  type of heat resonance you have with heat scanners infrared so they can swat
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.880]  team your house you know how people get swat teamed all the time and they say
[12:14.880 --> 12:18.120]  well your power bill was too high it must have been marijuana you were
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.840]  growing come on government you're run by a big farmer that pushes deadly
[12:21.840 --> 12:25.680]  psychotropic and other drugs on the population prescription garbage
[12:25.680 --> 12:31.000]  hillbilly heroin the rest of it oxy cotton kills by an order of
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.640]  conservatively 10 times what illegal drugs do every year conservatively you're
[12:35.640 --> 12:39.840]  pushing them on school kids of the new freedom initiative the US Army and
[12:39.840 --> 12:44.960]  Marine Corps grows the opium 93% of the world's supply in Afghanistan and loads
[12:44.960 --> 12:49.480]  it on C-130 to ship it in and your excuse to swat team us should take our
[12:49.480 --> 12:57.480]  houses and cars and all the rest of it is marijuana Mary Jane and then when
[12:57.480 --> 13:01.280]  14 states move to say we're gonna legalize it
[13:01.280 --> 13:06.320]  Obama swat teams the legal dispensaries I mean I've just had enough of it you're
[13:06.320 --> 13:10.360]  a bunch of narcotics traffickers who want to keep it illegal so you can run
[13:10.360 --> 13:17.640]  the stinking black market I'm sorry I'm ranting the sheriff wants drones to
[13:17.640 --> 13:20.600]  peek inside buildings technology previously used to hunt insurgents in
[13:20.600 --> 13:25.720]  Afghanistan and it's already going in nationwide and if this story goes big
[13:25.720 --> 13:29.560]  they'll just come out and say well there's there's no drones we never heard
[13:29.560 --> 13:34.160]  of those Lockheed Martin to control Pentagon's global information grid
[13:34.160 --> 13:38.400]  privatization of the Pentagon Homeland Security learns to love small spy
[13:38.400 --> 13:43.960]  drones that's wired magazine but it doesn't exist in the Pentagon you know
[13:43.960 --> 13:48.360]  wired magazine reported last week that their number one enemy is constitutionalist
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.280]  and those that don't trust the government years after we broke that news but
[13:52.280 --> 13:55.840]  it's okay I mean you know Pentagon's now running checkpoints all over the
[13:55.840 --> 13:59.800]  country illegally but NSA spy and honesty legally but you know what I was
[13:59.800 --> 14:05.320]  thinking this morning that this show sounds crazy because it's in reality and
[14:05.320 --> 14:11.480]  but it is crazy it is crazy I hear my rebroadcast sometimes on the local
[14:11.480 --> 14:19.920]  affiliates 590 90.1 other stations and or sometimes I hear radio playing clips
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.800]  of me making fun of me you know other I just randomly tune in as my playing
[14:23.800 --> 14:29.280]  clips make it fun of me oh look he thinks he thinks other you know the NSA
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.720]  spine on us what a cook and I'm like I understand why even though this is all
[14:33.720 --> 14:37.440]  admitted the ignorant their experts on dancing with the stars and America's got
[14:37.440 --> 14:43.560]  talent and NFL or whatever the case is it does sound crazy I mean if I'm up
[14:43.560 --> 14:47.800]  here saying that thousands of schools thousands now have cameras in the
[14:47.800 --> 14:51.480]  bathrooms watching the kids go to the bathroom and take showers in public
[14:51.480 --> 14:56.480]  schools that sounds crazy if I announce all over the country they now admit
[14:56.480 --> 15:00.080]  what four years ago they tried to cover up that government-issued laptops are
[15:00.080 --> 15:08.120]  watching employees and students whether your government worker or a public
[15:08.120 --> 15:11.720]  school student your government training student you are being watched and now
[15:11.720 --> 15:14.720]  I've got articles today whether like yeah we're watching at home what's the big
[15:14.720 --> 15:22.560]  deal I mean it's beyond 1984 and that's why it sounds so crazy because the
[15:22.560 --> 15:34.040]  elites are crazy and if you studied history if you studied history you will
[15:34.040 --> 15:37.440]  know that well just look at what all the elites have done different elites they
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.280]  always think they're God and start murdering everybody in mass or demanding
[15:41.280 --> 15:45.800]  your first born be sacrificed or burning cities down for fun or you know some
[15:45.800 --> 15:49.320]  neighbor challenges them so they take over and kill every man woman a child you
[15:49.320 --> 15:55.760]  know or line 2,000 miles of Roman roads with people crucified upside down just
[15:55.760 --> 16:01.840]  because they want to you know hail the birthday of the Emperor or you know what

[16:07.680 --> 16:14.080]  the marriage of the Emperor just a raw exercise of power I've got several
[16:14.080 --> 16:17.840]  articles today about the TSA in mainstream news one of them out of
[16:17.840 --> 16:25.480]  Seattle local TV Como TV where people are in wheelchairs after serious surgeries
[16:25.480 --> 16:31.520]  one woman terminal with cancer and the TSA removes the bandages to make sure
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.440]  it's not a bomb see there's no medical rules anymore there's no
[16:36.440 --> 16:48.000]  hypocriticals there's no fourth amendment there's no nothing anymore there is simply
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.520]  the system is going to dominate you and you're like but it's so horrible it's so
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.600]  brutal that's the point the point is they're going to change your mores
[16:57.600 --> 17:02.760]  they're going to change your attitude they're going to train you line up and
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.480]  the army is going to search you when we say and you know what I've got an article
[17:06.480 --> 17:13.360]  here out of Austin they admit it happened the family calls an ambulance and
[17:13.360 --> 17:21.000]  says you know he's flailing around all over the place dad's flailing around and
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.880]  so along with the fire truck in the in the ambulance comes the police and the
[17:24.880 --> 17:30.400]  police get there and they order a man having a full-born violent seizure that's
[17:30.400 --> 17:36.360]  in my new stack here today to freeze and in their threat continuum you know first
[17:36.360 --> 17:40.680]  they start Billy clubbing you or tasering you and then 10 of them will sit on

[25:09.440 --> 25:13.800]  into it I haven't even mentioned really what's coming up yet
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.920]  I mean here it is we knew it was coming it's in the New York Times Kurt Nemo
[25:19.920 --> 25:25.440]  wrote an article about it it's up at info wars.com it is a big big deal we've
[25:25.440 --> 25:28.760]  known for nine months our so-called government run by for the foreign
[25:28.760 --> 25:32.600]  megabanks remember we've been captured as well for financial fraud now they want
[25:32.600 --> 25:37.000]  to militarily put strips on the streets just to get everybody officially
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.360]  conquered and the poor Syrians who've tried to work with the West just like
[25:42.360 --> 25:46.560]  Gaddafi's tried to work with the West are absolutely under nine months of
[25:46.560 --> 25:53.080]  sustained al Qaeda attack and as you know now starting what's eight almost nine
[25:53.080 --> 25:59.720]  days ago Turkey began shelling the entire border region that they said so that
[25:59.720 --> 26:05.200]  they could help bring in more jihadis mainly out of Saudi Arabia and they have
[26:05.200 --> 26:09.120]  US troops right there on the border on record Kurt Nemo links to all this
[26:09.120 --> 26:16.760]  training them and arming them to go in and the Russians that are there backing
[26:16.760 --> 26:22.880]  up the Syrians they have been fighting to keep the infiltrators from getting in
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.520]  where they can then have house-to-house battles in the different Syrian cities
[26:27.520 --> 26:33.040]  they're trying to stop them at the border and so NATO made mortars that's come
[26:33.040 --> 26:37.280]  out as sort of getting fired back into a few civilian areas so they could then
[26:37.280 --> 26:41.520]  blame it on Syria and then the big tell is that Syria never said they were
[26:41.520 --> 26:48.520]  doing it but our media said Syria admits they're attacking Turkey and then Syria's
[26:48.520 --> 26:51.840]  like no we're not we don't want you invaders you're doing this you're the
[26:51.840 --> 26:55.920]  ones attacking us but it doesn't matter our media is now the same ones that you
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.400]  know tell you the Federal Reserve as a government agency they're now saying
[27:00.400 --> 27:04.640]  that they're gonna have to bomb Syria which of course they promised eight
[27:04.640 --> 27:09.400]  months ago they never do because Syria is attacking poor little Turkey with the
[27:09.400 --> 27:14.360]  biggest military in the Middle East US moves to impose buffer zone inside Syria
[27:14.360 --> 27:20.080]  near Jordan border by the way I want to get see Bell Edmonds on she of course
[27:20.080 --> 27:24.440]  worked at the FBI decoding in a shade she's got a lot of inside intel on this
[27:24.440 --> 27:30.960]  try to get see Bell on tomorrow or Friday if we can or maybe Sunday US moves
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.720]  to impose buffer zone inside Syria so they now have one on the on the on the
[27:35.720 --> 27:42.000]  Turkey Syria border and now the Jordan border with the shelling and it's on
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.640]  they're now sending in publicly US troops and Pentagon advisors that they
[27:47.640 --> 27:50.240]  admitted eight nine months ago they already had there but now it's just
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.120]  they're going public with the peace action to protect Turkey this would be
[27:55.120 --> 28:01.160]  like if Mexico publicly attacked Guatemala and had insurgents attack
[28:01.160 --> 28:05.720]  trying to overthrow Guatemala on their southern border and then said we need the
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.520]  US to attack Guatemala because Guatemala is attacking Mexico and
[28:10.520 --> 28:15.520]  everybody it is so dumb there's a nine month war where Mexico is attacking
[28:15.520 --> 28:22.400]  Guatemala you know to use that analogy it's just so a stronger state Mexico is
[28:22.400 --> 28:26.800]  a much stronger state militarily than Guatemala so I use the Turkey Syria thing
[28:26.800 --> 28:33.080]  and I mean this is a Roman ruins everywhere big beautiful cities an old
[28:33.080 --> 28:41.760]  world not a third world country we've had Sunni exiles on the show like Syrian
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.360]  girl who was run out by the previous facade she doesn't even like a sod we
[28:46.360 --> 28:49.440]  need to get Syrian girl back on to and you know she's been calling like it is
[28:49.440 --> 28:52.320]  from the start accurately and she's against what's happening because to
[28:52.320 --> 28:58.760]  watch al Qaeda brought in and blow up the old mosque and churches and
[28:58.760 --> 29:04.080]  synagogues and blow up the old the oldest grocery store in the world the
[29:04.080 --> 29:07.760]  World Heritage site and you they just blew the whole thing up I mean they're
[29:07.760 --> 29:14.200]  blowing that place up and most immoral war crimes you can imagine on record
[29:14.200 --> 29:20.040]  they are well it's on the news and this is it's patriotic the al Qaeda those
[29:20.040 --> 29:23.040]  and finds the dad says we're gonna kill your family if you don't go truck bomb
[29:23.040 --> 29:27.280]  the dad gets in and drives the truck bomb in and if they don't they chop the
[29:27.280 --> 29:31.320]  kids heads off and throw them off roofs and it's on the foreign news I mean
[29:31.320 --> 29:34.960]  this is what our government's doing and Mitt Romney's like Obama's not doing
[29:34.960 --> 29:39.560]  enough get in there and overthrow Assad so we get back Turkey warren Syria it
[29:39.560 --> 29:45.360]  may use greater force US military has sent to Jordan to help with crisis in
[29:45.360 --> 29:51.320]  Syria the crisis they created unbelievable we're on the March the

[34:24.400 --> 34:28.520]  this proves everything you're talking about how Al Qaeda works for the West we
[34:28.520 --> 34:32.040]  know Al Qaeda was created by the West but and we know they use them to attack
[34:32.040 --> 34:35.800]  the Serbs of the 90s and then say oh look the Serbs are fighting back we've
[34:35.800 --> 34:40.640]  got to have NATO attack Serbia and now they've used them against Libya they're
[34:40.640 --> 34:44.800]  using them against Syria and then they're saying oh my gosh every day a
[34:44.800 --> 34:50.040]  mortar gets shot across the border and blows up some you know you know village
[34:50.040 --> 34:54.080]  shack I don't think anybody's even been killed so we've got to invade the whole
[34:54.080 --> 35:00.160]  country now while Syria is under concerted attack and house-to-house
[35:00.160 --> 35:06.160]  fighting going on in the major cities I mean it is so incredibly immoral what's
[35:06.160 --> 35:10.920]  going on Turkey warrants Syria it may use greater force and the New York Times
[35:10.920 --> 35:15.160]  folks told us about yellow cake and Niger and aluminum tubes and were caught
[35:15.160 --> 35:19.800]  lying with Syria's civil strife horsing through major cities and unsettling
[35:19.800 --> 35:23.480]  neighboring countries and look they report it like all the civil strife
[35:23.480 --> 35:28.800]  isn't it so sad when the West literally on record started the whole thing the
[35:28.800 --> 35:32.880]  Turkish military shounded a somber warning on Wednesday that it may respond
[35:32.880 --> 35:37.960]  more forcibly after days of shelling from Syria and the shish and and the
[35:37.960 --> 35:41.200]  shelling is a few mortars which the evidence shows are being shot by the
[35:41.200 --> 35:45.840]  Al Qaeda rebels that well I mean it's a false flag it's a staged event news
[35:45.840 --> 35:49.240]  reports on Wednesday spoke of an intensified fighting close the Turkish
[35:49.240 --> 35:54.080]  Syrian border near the Syrian frontier settlement with mortar and machine gun
[35:54.080 --> 35:59.440]  fire clearly audible from the Turkish side as fighting near the 550 mile border
[35:59.440 --> 36:05.680]  as unfolded over the past week several mortar bombs have landed on Turkish soil
[36:05.680 --> 36:12.000]  prompting Turkish gunners to return fire it has not been clear whether the Syrian
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.120]  mortar is deliberate or the result of an inaccurate firing clashes between
[36:15.120 --> 36:18.400]  government forces and rebels seeking the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad
[36:18.400 --> 36:22.680]  well I thought I thought Syria seven eight days ago took credit for of course
[36:22.680 --> 36:29.880]  they didn't again ladies and gentlemen on 888 in 2008 I got up and the news was
[36:29.880 --> 36:35.040]  announcing Russia has attacked Georgia I even though I've been on the air 14
[36:35.040 --> 36:40.520]  years or whatever it was at the time 13 years and was thought I was savvy I went
[36:40.520 --> 36:45.960]  on my show that day and announced Russia had attacked Georgia and then it
[36:45.960 --> 36:50.400]  started coming out well wait actually oh and it was even like on BBC well
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.400]  actually when Georgian forces attacked the Russian forces at Abkhazia in
[36:55.400 --> 36:59.960]  South Ossetia but our media just kept going for a few weeks but no Russia
[36:59.960 --> 37:04.160]  attacked and then and then and then you know I was an evil traitor for saying
[37:04.160 --> 37:10.280]  that we'll know actually it's admitted by NATO that South Ossetia and Abkhazia
[37:10.280 --> 37:15.160]  were attacked by Georgian forces I mean they went into the demilitarized zone
[37:15.160 --> 37:20.120]  those disputed zones since the end of World War two that has Russian you
[37:20.120 --> 37:25.640]  know populations that were persecuted by the Georgians vice versa kind of the
[37:25.640 --> 37:31.560]  Kosovo type situation again just a different area but similar and they
[37:31.560 --> 37:35.680]  just went into the barracks and killed hundreds of Russian soldiers so the
[37:35.680 --> 37:39.680]  Russians just poured in and pushed them back rolled nukes in and said okay
[37:39.680 --> 37:43.960]  NATO get out or we're gonna take the whole country NATO blanked and pulled
[37:43.960 --> 37:49.640]  back but what does that tell the world it came out that NATO ran that as some
[37:49.640 --> 37:54.560]  weird test of Russia to see what Russia would do and Russia did not blink the
[37:54.560 --> 37:58.240]  globalists are insane ladies and gentlemen they've got our Navy massing
[37:58.240 --> 38:04.360]  off the coast of China right now China is teetering financially getting ready to
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.080]  go under I mean this is this is crazy and again our countries run by the
[38:09.080 --> 38:12.320]  globalists that are playing all our countries off against each other the
[38:12.320 --> 38:16.240]  Iranian government's bad the Russian government's bad our government's bad
[38:16.240 --> 38:21.520]  the Japanese government predominantly is bad the Israeli government's bad the
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.320]  Syrian government's bad they're all corrupt corruption has become so accepted
[38:26.320 --> 38:30.240]  that that's the prerequisite to be in power is lying and deceiving and bought
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.480]  off by globalist special interests that are bigger than all the governments
[38:34.480 --> 38:39.040]  what you can look this up at the top 100 corporations or of the top 100
[38:39.040 --> 38:42.560]  biggest economies years ago it passed the line of more than half for
[38:42.560 --> 38:48.520]  corporations Walmart's bigger than most big governments most big GDPs most big
[38:48.520 --> 38:55.120]  countries GDPs that's just Walmart Exxon mobile but they're just
[38:55.120 --> 38:58.440]  corporations they're not the banking cartels that are enumerably bigger
[38:58.440 --> 39:04.760]  through fraud who've created a thousand plus trillion in fake garbage that they
[39:04.760 --> 39:08.400]  got everybody to buy into now they're holding everyone hostage and they need
[39:08.400 --> 39:13.520]  war as the political smokescreen so I want to ask just a little right to your
[39:13.520 --> 39:19.360]  calls for just a few military callers what is your take on this morally to know
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.320]  that you know even the council on foreign relations and the Washington Post and
[39:23.320 --> 39:28.560]  like times they admit okay yeah I'm 25% to 50% of the fighters are al-Qaeda yeah
[39:28.560 --> 39:32.440]  they're blowing up churches yeah they're gonna kick women out of college and
[39:32.440 --> 39:35.960]  make them were burkas just like they've done in Libya and yeah but you know what
[39:35.960 --> 39:39.840]  we're bringing down a sod we'll use al-Qaeda we'll deal with them later yeah
[39:39.840 --> 39:43.480]  a year after the killing of Qaddafi or less they're already saying they've got
[39:43.480 --> 39:48.320]  to reinvade Libya because of al-Qaeda they're saying they want to invade all
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.200]  these other African countries because of al-Qaeda where al-Qaeda is even at in
[39:52.200 --> 40:00.000]  places like Rwanda and where else are they at you know down there with the
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.400]  Lord's Resistance group set in Central Africa and they're saying that groups in
[40:05.400 --> 40:12.240]  three or four different places so all of this is happening all of this is going
[40:12.240 --> 40:23.560]  on all of this is unfolding and we're sitting here watching our country
[40:23.560 --> 40:33.160]  historically we are watching all of this historically happen I mean history is
[40:33.160 --> 40:39.920]  going on right now in front of all of us history is taking place right now in
[40:39.920 --> 40:48.240]  front of us and I've never seen something this openly immoral this openly
[40:48.240 --> 40:55.560]  completely and totally absolutely patently fraudulent I have never seen
[40:55.560 --> 40:58.160]  anything this I mean they've done corrupt things in the past we've had
[40:58.160 --> 41:03.880]  corrupt elites for a long time but but this is so over the top to have al-Qaeda
[41:03.880 --> 41:08.040]  in there engaging in mass war crimes throwing people off roofs chopping their
[41:08.040 --> 41:12.200]  heads off blowing up churches desecrating churches dressing up in
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.920]  orthodox priest robes making jokes al-Qaeda videos you know where they're
[41:16.920 --> 41:21.720]  on tape going yes America's helping us today but I will kill you soon we will
[41:21.720 --> 41:25.240]  hoist the al-Qaeda flag over the White House we will kill you infidel
[41:25.240 --> 41:31.560]  Christians and we'll blow Israel up and and we're sitting there watching this as
[41:31.560 --> 41:35.800]  our government says hey we've got to take all your rights and all of your
[41:35.800 --> 41:40.680]  liberties we've got to do this because al-Qaeda is everywhere they've got to
[41:40.680 --> 41:46.880]  take 92-year-old women who've just had you know cancer surgery who are going
[41:46.880 --> 41:52.240]  home to die and they've got to rip the bandages off of them they've got to rip
[41:52.240 --> 41:57.080]  appendages out of people they've got to pull catheters out of people's genitals
[41:57.080 --> 42:01.720]  they've got to rip colostomy bags off as feces splatters everywhere this is on the
[42:01.720 --> 42:06.360]  news they're like what is that it's a colostomy bag I'm ripping it off you know
[42:06.360 --> 42:10.960]  this is what things have turned it's all just total acts of domination by crazy
[42:10.960 --> 42:15.840]  elites and they know what they're doing what they're still insane they're crazy
[42:15.840 --> 42:21.040]  like a fox but this is all insane because the elite is insane here's the
[42:21.040 --> 42:31.080]  toll-free number 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and we will get you up and
[42:31.080 --> 42:43.240]  on the air today because because I want to hear from you I want to know where you
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.040]  think all this is going I mean you don't think Switzerland's publicly saying
[42:47.040 --> 42:50.080]  they're getting ready for Europe's collapse and massively increasing their
[42:50.080 --> 42:54.560]  military to keep refugees out of Switzerland because you know they're
[42:54.560 --> 42:58.120]  just doing that for nothing they've never done this except pre-World War two
[42:58.120 --> 43:04.240]  that was the last time speaking of World War two you know I had read this back
[43:04.240 --> 43:09.880]  when I was had time to read history books as a as a pleasurable experience
[43:09.880 --> 43:15.280]  I used to read several big history books every month sometimes every week and I
[43:15.280 --> 43:21.360]  remember reading conspiracy theory out of Hitler's mouth that when he didn't
[43:21.360 --> 43:24.840]  like what somebody was saying he would say they were a conspiracy theorist
[43:24.840 --> 43:30.600]  before that they would say you're crazy or you're making things up or that it's
[43:30.600 --> 43:34.520]  wild rumors or that you were an old lady those were the terms they would use
[43:34.520 --> 43:41.280]  to discredit somebody as a as just a throwaway line but the word conspiracy
[43:41.280 --> 43:46.160]  theory the first time it it's been confirmed to have been used as an
[43:46.160 --> 43:52.320]  article in info wars.com about this today madman Hitler in 1945 the Holocaust
[43:52.320 --> 43:59.080]  is a conspiracy theory and he broadcast from his bunker underneath the right
[43:59.080 --> 44:01.880]  chancellery
[44:06.440 --> 44:15.240]  that it was a conspiracy theory to say that he had killed any Jews and my only
[44:15.240 --> 44:20.400]  point is is that when they use terms like conspiracy theory it's just amazing
[44:20.400 --> 44:26.720]  okay continuing here folks I see that your calls are coming in I'll go to those
[44:26.720 --> 44:35.000]  here in a moment we've got Ben Stein coming on the broadcast Matt Stein I've
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.880]  tried to get Ben Stein on I said that Matt Stein when technology fails to
[44:40.880 --> 44:44.400]  give us his perspective on this and also this culture why is the mainstream
[44:44.400 --> 44:51.600]  media pushing 24-7 right now that there's going to be a societal collapse
[44:51.600 --> 44:55.560]  so that's a meme they're pushing but they're always acting like it's going
[44:55.560 --> 44:59.280]  to be some outside event that happens so it's kind of collectively in the
[44:59.280 --> 45:02.320]  subconscious because they know the general public there was an article out
[45:02.320 --> 45:07.640]  yesterday about one of the stars of one of these shows where the you know the
[45:07.640 --> 45:10.760]  right-wingers don't want to turn their guns in so they're terrorists it's a
[45:10.760 --> 45:16.840]  call revolution he's on the show and he says people start fights with him just
[45:16.840 --> 45:23.680]  hearing that he's playing a terrorist show I mean that's how this works and
[45:23.680 --> 45:27.560]  that's why people are always going to liquor stores and shooting seeks because
[45:27.560 --> 45:30.840]  there weren't a turban on their head and have a beard they don't know their
[45:30.840 --> 45:34.600]  scores of religions that you know have big beards and turbines on their heads
[45:34.600 --> 45:38.920]  over in the in the East Near East Far East you name it and then they don't
[45:38.920 --> 45:42.360]  even apologize when these guys go to prison they say oh I know he was Alcada
[45:42.360 --> 45:46.920]  you know when they get the guy up on stand seeing the cases with I know he's
[45:46.920 --> 45:52.760]  one I'm so I mean you know that's it it's just they're just there now pushing
[45:52.760 --> 45:55.640]  this whole thing getting everybody ready for the collapse everyone just
[45:55.640 --> 46:01.360]  expects it and then blames oh peak oil or the Kuiper belt object or you know
[46:01.360 --> 46:06.920]  whatever it is when it's a organized agenda 21 implosion of society James
[46:06.920 --> 46:12.320]  Jared John and others James is in the Marine Corps do you disagree with me do
[46:12.320 --> 46:16.320]  you agree I mean it's admitted they're putting al-Qaeda in Syria and gave
[46:16.320 --> 46:20.560]  Libya over to them and gave them 10,000 missiles and we're simultaneously now
[46:20.560 --> 46:25.520]  being told they've got to attack Syria and Iran because they're al-Qaeda that
[46:25.520 --> 46:30.520]  was in the news yesterday what's your what's your take on this
[46:30.520 --> 46:38.200]  Alex yes or no this is James look here I've been Marine Corps and look I've worked on logistics and communications so
[46:38.200 --> 46:41.520]  forward the deal when they tell you about the mortars hidden you know we all our
[46:41.520 --> 46:45.120]  mortars that get it the biggest one we have the 80 millimeter mortars they only
[46:45.120 --> 46:50.160]  the distance is speaking they only will get about three miles up on the board from
[46:50.160 --> 46:55.680]  Syria to Turkey you look at my 250 miles from the sort of border so they need to
[46:55.680 --> 46:58.960]  get their logistics right when they tell people stuff like that guys like that's
[46:58.960 --> 47:02.800]  right there that see what's going on it's been there that they understand that
[47:02.800 --> 47:07.480]  all this is a big wash and they keep this up we're gonna basically have
[47:07.480 --> 47:12.040]  ourselves under man I'm good and everything else and then we're gonna be
[47:12.040 --> 47:18.280]  taking over see that also I think the people that did this long time ago do
[47:18.280 --> 47:23.440]  you know back in 1970s I want to make for 1978 they were trying to get us to
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.880]  wear the blue helmet and other guys back then refused to wear those helmets and we
[47:27.880 --> 47:30.840]  said we would not do it but that's the reason why they brought up the old guy
[47:30.840 --> 47:36.040]  like us but we were dedicated to the Corps and to the United States yeah I've
[47:36.040 --> 47:41.440]  seen reports of 60 year old Marines right now that are in combat some even
[47:41.440 --> 47:46.280]  older just amazing how many of the older generation they've had to go get join the
[47:46.280 --> 47:52.400]  military rejoin exactly because simple reason that we was taught I mean from
[47:52.400 --> 47:56.600]  old school and we would like to say we was dedicated but these guys that got
[47:56.600 --> 48:02.480]  now they didn't understand that they are basically exhausted all your supplies
[48:02.480 --> 48:06.840]  and everything else so people need to wake up and you're right I mean I'm
[48:06.840 --> 48:09.540]  listening to you so I'll show for a long time I think when you first started up
[48:09.540 --> 48:12.800]  class I'm listening to you though I've gotten sitting in the background we'll
[48:12.800 --> 48:16.880]  basically monitoring everything that's happening and so everything about most
[48:16.880 --> 48:20.160]  Marines I know that's in the units out been in they just hunkering down and
[48:20.160 --> 48:22.880]  just waiting to see what actually going out because right now they can't be
[48:22.880 --> 48:27.440]  exposed and people that is in charge of the show they are tyrannical they have
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.160]  basically lost a moral scope exactly because America's never been perfect but
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.680]  I've never publicly using al-Qaeda to go invade countries that aren't attacking
[48:36.680 --> 48:40.600]  anybody and then saying on the news we've got to attack Syria because they
[48:40.600 --> 48:45.480]  they're al-Qaeda when it's admitted it's al-Qaeda attacking Syria I mean how dumb
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.680]  do they think the general public is well pretty darn dumb but like you just said
[48:49.680 --> 48:54.280]  military like family I've got that's been in Turkey been in Jordan been in
[48:54.280 --> 49:00.600]  Israel they all know the players for the military it's blowing them away to be
[49:00.600 --> 49:06.000]  publicly helping al-Qaeda right now exactly well I mean but what has to
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.600]  happen is that people have to realize that between al-Qaeda and CIA we know
[49:11.600 --> 49:16.880]  that presents you started it we might affect we over there in Pakistan and
[49:16.880 --> 49:20.120]  running around just doing it so good like they you know everything but
[49:20.120 --> 49:25.000]  Cheney can say it everything that the bill that said and people with any
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.040]  agency the NSA to CIA all the good people that know what's going on they'd
[49:29.040 --> 49:33.000]  like to say they basically just see how put it that stuff is gonna go but right
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.600]  now they don't want to be compromised for a simple reason that they can be
[49:36.600 --> 49:41.280]  taken out so that's why we don't see what happens and what comes to a head and
[49:41.280 --> 49:45.520]  then I think things will change pretty soon I hear you God bless you you know I
[49:45.520 --> 49:47.920]  agree with that and that's a point of a meaning to make we're gonna break and
[49:47.920 --> 49:51.920]  come back with more your calls of a mean to make that for weeks here is that hey
[49:51.920 --> 49:57.000]  there's not just bad guys in this world there's a lot of good people and they
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.160]  just stay right where they're at because that's the people ask why am I alive
[50:00.160 --> 50:03.880]  well the grace of God number one but number two there are a lot of good people
[50:03.880 --> 50:08.560]  in government and out of government and in media there are all sorts of people in
[50:08.560 --> 50:13.280]  media that have quietly helped us over the years get the word out even though
[50:13.280 --> 50:16.800]  sometimes I'm not the best spokesman I'll say it myself up front I'm just
[50:16.800 --> 50:20.160]  doing the best job I can that's all I can do but there have been so many people
[50:20.160 --> 50:24.880]  that have given info wars a shot because they know this information overall is

[50:32.960 --> 50:38.240]  because they're good guys who realize that there's no future if we don't turn
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.260]  this around I mean folks this is pure evil we're dealing with our country has
[50:43.260 --> 50:47.360]  been hijacked by foreign banks who brag they've hijacked us and now they've got
[50:47.360 --> 50:52.640]  America on a kamikaze mission that is meant to destroy our name bankrupt us I
[50:52.640 --> 50:57.120]  agree with the Marine this is meant to set America up what's happening right

[51:13.320 --> 51:16.520]  seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy

[51:30.320 --> 51:34.760]  fermented porges Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[51:34.760 --> 51:38.080]  healthy living but here's some good news South for Lyon Americans can now

[54:19.240 --> 54:23.840]  military people that go well that's just war yeah we'll use al-qaeda to kill the
[54:23.840 --> 54:27.800]  Shiites and then we'll we'll kill the Shiites after that you know let's just
[54:27.800 --> 54:32.440]  get them killing each other hey they're using the threat of al-qaeda in all this
[54:32.440 --> 54:36.840]  to take our liberties while in the real training manuals it says it's for the
[54:36.840 --> 54:41.720]  American people it was never about al-qaeda you get it al-qaeda works for
[54:41.720 --> 54:46.080]  Saudi Arabian intelligence who works for British intelligence who works for the
[54:46.080 --> 54:51.360]  Rothschilds on record look at who founded our CIA out of the OSS British
[54:51.360 --> 54:55.920]  intelligence I'm not blaming the British people but the imperial model from
[54:55.920 --> 55:01.960]  the Empire Wars of the last 500 years was perfected by British intelligence so
[55:01.960 --> 55:07.200]  their model is the modern model used today this is a proxy war divide and
[55:07.200 --> 55:14.440]  conquer Balkanization program that you're seeing and it's evil it's pure
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.600]  evil and they're going to stage terror attacks there's no doubt and blame it on
[55:18.600 --> 55:22.440]  domestic groups and say that we work with al-qaeda that's already in the Army
[55:22.440 --> 55:28.280]  training manuals and I'm not going along with this okay this is how they plan on
[55:28.280 --> 55:34.920]  conquer in our country and I it's just amazing amazing to see it let's talk to
[55:34.920 --> 55:39.000]  Jared in Oklahoma whose Marine Corps we'll talk to John whose army Jared in
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.080]  Oklahoma your take on all this
[55:42.080 --> 55:48.960]  hello mr. Jones good afternoon how you doing I I think it's crazy you know I was
[55:48.960 --> 55:54.320]  recently just kicked out of the Marine Corps because I didn't agree with the
[55:54.320 --> 56:00.560]  ideology of coming to Afghanistan and kill everybody you see you know I stand
[56:00.560 --> 56:03.360]  up for the bill or act in the Constitution I've been listening to your
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.640]  show for about three years and if you don't agree with these people in the
[56:07.640 --> 56:13.160]  military the ideology of kill first ask questions later you're branded as a
[56:13.160 --> 56:20.240]  lunatic conspiracy theorist you know Mitchell mushroom head and this is
[56:20.240 --> 56:24.720]  crazy well you know why they say kill first ask questions later a lot of times
[56:24.720 --> 56:29.480]  it's whoever fires first will end up winning the fight the problem is then
[56:29.480 --> 56:34.880]  you lose the moral authority long term see you kill first if you're in a war
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.400]  and there's the enemy but when you employ those type of operations against
[56:39.400 --> 56:43.760]  the general public you lose the hearts and minds but again the real larger
[56:43.760 --> 56:48.160]  strategy is to destroy our name worldwide see I learned about this over a
[56:48.160 --> 56:53.240]  decade ago and I noticed globalist publications like News Corp would bad
[56:53.240 --> 56:58.960]  mouth America overseas in newspapers but then not do it here domestically so
[56:58.960 --> 57:03.520]  see they play both sides these are globalist above the countries what's
[57:03.520 --> 57:08.720]  your take though on the west injecting upwards of 50,000 al-Qaeda now into
[57:08.720 --> 57:17.200]  Syria but saying we have to attack Syria because they're with al-Qaeda it's just
[57:17.200 --> 57:21.520]  brainwashing people because average American doesn't really understand
[57:21.520 --> 57:26.000]  what's going on or even takes the time out of a day to investigate certain
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.680]  things absolutely I hear you and I appreciate your call let's go to John
[57:29.680 --> 57:34.120]  in Tennessee who's arming John what's your take on this
[57:34.120 --> 57:38.800]  hi doing Alex I'm a first-time caller just been listening to you for the last
[57:38.800 --> 57:45.200]  couple months here I feel like I have a lot to catch up to to feel like I'm on

[57:51.160 --> 57:54.480]  back I'm sorry I'm a little nervous sure it's okay what's what I mean what do you
[57:54.480 --> 57:57.240]  think of them putting al-Qaeda into Syria I mean that's admitted I mean is that a
[57:57.240 --> 58:03.360]  good thing I think it's despicable at the end of the day you've got the you've
[58:03.360 --> 58:13.040]  got the same guys who are destroying Syria under under our own government's
[58:13.040 --> 58:20.920]  intent and and you know these if you if you look around and see reports from you
[58:20.920 --> 58:27.600]  know actual steering civilians you see that they they they say that that these
[58:27.600 --> 58:33.640]  guys that are these rebels they're like 95% of them are foreign and it's not it's
[58:33.640 --> 58:37.480]  not sure stay there back in one minute yeah and and roughly half of them are
[58:37.480 --> 58:51.720]  al-Qaeda this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network the silver

[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:22.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:28.040]  all right it's another hour of worldwide radio second hour thank you for
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.320]  joining us coming up we're gonna talk to a special guest about Switzerland
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:38.000]  prepares for mass civil unrest in Europe get into the economic news but now the
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.080]  so-called United States that means the banker run US military banks to run
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:48.200]  is doing what we knew they would do carving out the controlled military
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.920]  zones to inject jihadis al-qaeda and others on the turkey Syria border and
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.560]  the Jordan Sierra border where they have us bases shut up on both sides training
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.240]  them along with their NATO forces and they've got CIA MI6 and others inside
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.320]  the country Russian generals been confirmed to be killed it's a proxy
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.880]  war the Russians backing the Syrians and the United States and NATO backing the
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.320]  Saudi Arabian al-qaeda people and it's unbelievably immoral they started the
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:23.640]  war they call it a humanitarian action it is it is it is it is wild and now
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.200]  they're moving towards a strike on Iran that's in the news we've got a caller
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.120]  from who's in the army John in Tennessee John overall when you talk to your
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:39.320]  friends in the military are they even concerned about what's going on in
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.680]  the Middle East or are they conscious of the fact that they're gearing up towards
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:48.440]  what Secretary of Defense Panetta called a larger regional war where the
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.840]  United States and NATO are allied with the Ashuni Wahhabist al-qaeda in a
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.800]  battle against Shiites does that sound like a fun thing to be in the middle of
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:03.840]  a Arab civil war no definitely not I mean the the Sunni Shiite thing has been
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.560]  going on for quite some time and and there's there's no doubt in my mind that
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:15.160]  that the whole MO with that is to just you know create disruption in that
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:23.360]  general area I just wanted to get you up on on me I I was medically retired from
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.680]  military back in 2010 not active duty right now I just want to my take the
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.840]  the take period of active duty or people to just got out so what I mean if you're
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.920]  talking to friends though what's their take on all this well but I'm talking
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.560]  to if I'm talking to veterans who are already out like me they some of them
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:47.880]  are opening up their eyes to it because because I don't know I mean when you
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.080]  when you get out like I like it's been for me you know you sit around you
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.800]  think a lot think about everything to happen and I couldn't help but you know
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:07.640]  want to look more into everything you know I I actually had a point I wanted
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.760]  to bring up about the bin Laden raid because I saw an article on your website
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:18.920]  about it early this morning I was I did I ended up doing 25 cumulative months in
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:27.880]  Iraq as an infantryman and I conducted thunder raids and when you when you
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.840]  put the big picture together thinking about that whole bin Laden raid
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.920]  something that just makes no sense whatsoever and that a lot of people
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:43.480]  really haven't been bringing up is that if bin Laden according to according to
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:49.000]  the way their story was was living and breathing inside that compound before
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.880]  before they conducted that raid for for field team six to be to be going in and
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:02.120]  rating that compound and know that he's he's alive in there and not take him
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.920]  alive makes no sense and here's why our intelligence standpoint if the Obama
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:12.080]  administration were able to get their hands on a live captured bin Laden the
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.320]  benefit to their administration is unquantifiable they could they could
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.200]  they could parade him around but but he worked for the globalist he worked for
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.720]  Brzezinski so you can't do that plus the helicopter blew up and they blew up the
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:32.160]  rest of the field team six a month later and it was some type of dummy guy some
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.160]  kind of look alike so they threw the body in the sea I mean it's like little
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.520]  kids believe that Santa Claus comes down the chimney I was three years old they
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.640]  were telling me that on Christmas Eve and I said he's too fat and because I'm a
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:48.800]  bad person I mean I should believe in Santa Claus but I don't but yeah I know
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.120]  I mean obviously the whole story is a joke the situation room photos are fake
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:56.640]  all things fake if people believe bin Laden was really killed in that raid they
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.960]  believe in the tooth fairy we'll be right back stay with us sick of the
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.640]  globalist you Genesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing

[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.360]  there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.120]  frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.880]  remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.040]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:30.360]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.840]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.200]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.440]  discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.920]  privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these foods as long

[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:12.240]  implosion of society to shut down their competition and consolidate power and
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:16.360]  overthrow the gains that Western civilization has made for liberty and
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:22.640]  freedom and a level playing field since 1215 and the Magna Carta the
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.240]  globalists want to reverse all that and they admit that's their plan we have to
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.760]  get angry we have to say no to that plan all right for the balance of the hour

[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.440]  about zombie apocalypse be ready for it implying you know when the welfare
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.680]  checks don't don't work anymore the general public to turn into something
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.160]  like zombies we've made that point for many years and now Paul Watson's article
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:08.600]  up at info wars.com and prison planet.com Switzerland prepares for mass
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.760]  civil unrest in Europe fears over race wars economic fallout prompt new

[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:57.480]  construction of the technocratic technotronic technocracy based prison
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.960]  planet hence prison planet.com and the video streams at prison planet.tv I
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.760]  didn't do any plugging in the first hour I always seem to forget that and it's
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.760]  important to do that because we're shelf-funded here by our sponsors and
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.080]  listeners in the different ways that we've been able to build a news
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.760]  organization with all total about 50 people 51 people accounting some of the
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.960]  contractors upwards of 10 reporters now the video editors the researchers
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:28.080]  customer service the shipping department all of it 52 souls total the
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.440]  writers Kurt Nemo, Don Salazar, Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, his
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.800]  brother. We're gonna be breaking all this down here but you know that in the
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.480]  last two months I launched or in the last month and a half I launched a new
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.400]  salvo in the info war because of internet kill switches and calls to shut
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.960]  down print and the dinosaur media imploding online not just in print I
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.000]  decided to go with what listeners for 15 years of my 17 years on air have begged
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.640]  for a newsletter a magazine but I finally got to the point I've got a
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:03.040]  graphics department editors all the people and we put out the first issue in
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.480]  September the economic collapse bankers plot to destroy US economy and world
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:12.240]  economy Rome burned will we and then we've got just a limited number of those
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.760]  left because everything sold out we kept some so the first subscriptions get
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.200]  the first issue in the next 12 and we have the new technocracy drone combat
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.880]  robot globalist statements of the world they plan to build the end of humanity
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:33.160]  rise the robots if they have their way that has almost sold out so I decided
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:38.640]  because it costs a little more but but it's a little lighter so the shipping I
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.720]  sell these at cost is the point because this is an outreach so you have a good
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.200]  looking tool with great graphics and great articles and powerful headlines
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:51.240]  and powerful content to hand people in this world everything going digital when
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.440]  they zig I jag when print dies I go into print and that's why we have the new
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:01.720]  glossy now there are a few thousand left of the info wars newsprint October
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:07.020]  issue the technocracy and those are discount even below cost until we get
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:13.200]  rid of those an info or store.com and at cost we now have 10,000 as a test we
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:19.200]  did they just came in of the glossy and folks we got several places to test it
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:26.120]  out and found a wonderful place in Ohio that we're getting it done 48 pages and
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:31.160]  it is just really high quality glossy and believe me wait till I put 50,000 of
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.600]  these on the streets in Austin every month and the 50,000 out to you we've
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:38.600]  got distributors lined up around the block I've just got to get that
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.640]  bureaucracy going to get that going people ready to put this out in their
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.240]  area with their local content added to it they can either expand the size of the
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.240]  magazine or put it inside the current format we just got big publishers
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.560]  actually in magazine and newspaper publishers ready so this is definitely a
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:01.440]  success thanks to you the listeners supporting us 10,000 of the first of the
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:05.320]  new issues in glossy there will be no more newsprint I personally like it but
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.000]  everybody in the office likes the glossy better and so it's now going to be
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.400]  glossy in the future now most of you will get in the October issue you will
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.760]  get the newsprint one but if you want to order in bulk at cost the glossy you can
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.200]  but starting in November everything will be glossy no more newsprint so right
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.920]  now you can still get the newsprint and the glossy and info or store.com and you
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.360]  support getting the word out I mean you come up to people with something like
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.080]  this it looks like the old Rolling Stone you know it's the big format magazine
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.600]  everybody else has made their magazine smaller this is the big format glossy I
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:42.880]  mean hike with a poster inside so much more and believe me these 10,000 will
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.440]  sell fast because they're in groups of 10, 20, 50 up to a hundred at cost and then
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:53.080]  the old news prints we've reduced those about what about 30% in price to below
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:59.320]  cost just to blast them out the door so again info or store.com lastly later

[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:43.760]  surprises on the show maybe Dave Bustain Billy Corgan who knows maybe I'll get
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:48.160]  maybe I'll get a famous rock maybe we'll get Robert Plant on the show he lives

[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.560]  and I'm not bragging about all these famous people that are listeners it's a
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.580]  fact that we're starting to win the info war that so many prominent people are
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:15.200]  listeners Joe Perry is a listener want to say hi to him and he's invited me out
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.960]  they were doing their new record a year ago or so I didn't have time to go out to
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.400]  LA I'm not bragging about that the point is I could just keep naming names
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.920]  here of the people that have reached out to us over the years or people that we
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:29.480]  know are listeners Bruce Willis Rick Linklater told that story on air and
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:35.360]  later I confirmed it but I'll never tell Bruce Willis is a listener talked
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.600]  about how he woke up with a new world order in Vanity Fair well Bruce we
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.520]  haven't ever well maybe Bruce hadn't been on the show because I haven't tried to
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.640]  get him on it's kind of like what I'm hanging out with Harry Dean Stanton all
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.200]  these movie stars at Jesse's birthday party and I didn't even try to get him
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.560]  any of them on the show I'm just too cool for schools the problem anyways it
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.520]  doesn't matter side issue you're not tuning in to hear about that the point
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:59.480]  is we're gonna have some surprises as well during the 48 hour money bomb
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.720]  broadcast we can buy some more equipment get the satellite up links in we've

[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:09.260]  celebrities are in my mind there are trailblazers in the media they're
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:13.600]  standing up against tyranny I don't care of your local AMR FM host I don't care
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.900]  if you're a national TV host I don't care if you're an author the one of the
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:21.580]  coolest people ever even though I didn't agree with all of his politics was well
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.520]  people like Kurt Vonnegut was a listener but he told me he was too old to
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:28.600]  come on the show and I guess he was he was dead six months later but the point
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.320]  is there are a lot of people that love freedom out there and they need to speak
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.680]  out didn't agree with a lot of stuff that Gerva Dahl said but he's been on the
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.040]  show many times he's dead now God rest his soul but he had the courage to talk
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.720]  about 9-11 being an inside job and CNN being run by the Pentagon
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.320]  point is there's a lot of people that love liberty out there we have a lot of

[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:14.360]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:18.240]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.320]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been

[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:11.560]  why is it so hot why is it so big because you know we were talking off air
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.240]  he's talking about producer a few days ago we were trying to set him up last
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:20.440]  week about the fact that you have all these new TV shows out obsessed with all
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:28.240]  of this all of these new episodes like revolution and others and you know the
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:33.160]  world after humans and all these publications and discovery and history
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:38.960]  shows and the elites buying bunkers and governments digging in and then I have
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:45.000]  this report out of prison planet.com today by Paul Joseph Watson Switzerland
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.040]  prepares for mass civil unrest in Europe fears over race wars economic fallout
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.840]  prompt new military battalions and all read some of these quotes you've got the
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:57.800]  British Ministry of Defense report from 2007 predicting all this by 2015 they're
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.840]  not they're not saying it might happen they're predicting it and then you
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:04.560]  realize the banks are engineering it but now they've engineered it so far I
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.400]  don't think they can even reverse it now even if they tried perhaps I'm wrong
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.560]  but Matt the whole world especially the rich are gearing up for collapse and
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:17.280]  there's this obsession with it are they preparing us psychologically for the
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:22.600]  economic collapse or or is something really coming in some celestial cycle
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.600]  what what do you think's really happening well in my opinion clearly
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:32.440]  something is definitely happening and that people I mean you know we all go
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.200]  in high school when we draw graphs and we've got a whole bunch of graphs for the
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:39.920]  state of the world the natural systems the world that keep life as we going on
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.920]  planet Earth they're all headed for the bottom so basically business as usual is
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:50.160]  going to collapse the world as we know it now on top of that there's there's a
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.760]  guaranteed game over civilization changing event and that's the Sun has
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.000]  these massive solar storms and every several times a year coronal mass
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.760]  ejections of the size that would end like as we know it on planet Earth not
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.320]  not kill everybody but wipe out the grid the infrastructure collapse governments
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:15.120]  collapse stock market collapse all that these kinds these size CMEs launch out
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.960]  of the Sun several times a year regardless of the solar cycle it's just
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:22.200]  the most of the time you know with big science solar system and Earth's just a
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.960]  tiny little dot so most of the time it goes away from the planet Earth and
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:31.680]  nothing happens but statistically we get nailed by storm that size roughly
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.360]  once every 75 to 100 years has been 90 years since the last one in 1921 it was
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.440]  only 60 years before that since the big 1859 Carrington event to do the math
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:47.440]  that's an average of 75 years between the last two big events and it's been 90
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:52.480]  years since the last one so we're basically overdue so I think intuitively
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:57.520]  humanity on a mass scale is understanding that we can't keep doing
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.280]  what we're doing because we're soiling the nests and taking the planet down and
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:06.960]  business as usual profit as the God that runs the entire world like the profit
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:10.880]  is the supreme king it doesn't matter if we kill the planet so long as we make a
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:16.040]  buck while we're doing it I think that that model that we built our world on is
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.360]  also killing the world so so we got natural events from Mother Earth we got
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:27.400]  the very distinct possibility that a place like Iran I mean according to some
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:32.880]  people like this this student named Reza Khalili who claims he was in the
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:39.160]  Revolutionary Guard in was educated in America joined the Revolutionary Guard
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:45.000]  in the Revolution Iran got got disillusioned and joined the CIA whether
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.400]  he's I can't say whether the guy is a fictional character what is he saying
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:56.120]  what he's saying is that Iran actually has several nuclear devices including
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.960]  MPs that they put together well that's what Colonel that's what Colonel Schaefer
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:05.120]  who is definitely not a hawk says and I respect him a lot and I also have family
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:09.920]  pretty high up in the army and they say they told me five years ago look I ran
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.520]  already has two nukes so I don't know if that's internal propaganda or whether
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:19.160]  it's true but Colonel Schaefer believes it I agree I don't know either whether
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:24.760]  it's propaganda to push us to support in Israel but if they actually have the two
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:28.680]  to ten nuclear devices they're talking about then I think they're just waiting
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:35.080]  for an Israeli or US attack to justify doing an EMP attack on Israel and the
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.880]  United States just totally shut us down yeah I think that's what the big gear up
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.520]  that's what the Swiss government says is they're worried about World War three
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.560]  starting the Secretary of Defense says it could lead to that we'll be right back

[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:24.200]  can also call to order 888-253-3139
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:30.360]  here's what I'm saying if you just tune in with the first time welcome on Alex
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:36.280]  Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas Austin I know governments
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:42.600]  are buying 1.6 billion bullets it was 1.2 or five months ago now it's 1.6 they
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.680]  are buying drones they're setting up checkpoints so there's every day now I
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:51.280]  see articles all over the country with regular army not even in drills running
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:56.920]  real checkpoint searching people on highways there is this total preparation
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:02.680]  by governments everywhere for collapse and the big one I see is economic the
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:08.520]  1.5 conservatively 1,500 trillion in fraudulent debt created by the banks
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:12.640]  that they induce their agents in government that they lobby to get in
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.920]  place or ran for office they even appoint you know the leaders of Italy and
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.520]  Greece now I mean it's in Bragg that they've conquered Europe they are imploding
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.320]  things so you've got that then you've got what always accompanies depression
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:29.360]  engineered or not and that's big wars as political distractions they always
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:33.480]  that's in the standard playbook history follows this pattern because tyrants act
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:37.240]  the same those that don't know history doomed to repeat it and then you add to
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:41.680]  this government massively increasing underground bunker building but the
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:46.440]  tales are classified and you've got what I was just reading earlier and Matt
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:51.120]  Thomas heard to get into the reports that and and Gerald Salente believes
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:54.840]  this as well on many other analysts that if you do attack Iran they're not
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.200]  going to have to stage stuff because Iran is going to respond with asymmetrical
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:02.600]  warfare of course the globalist will stage something of a half you like
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.160]  they're doing claiming Turkey is shelling or claiming Syria shelling
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:12.040]  turkey as a pretext to carry that out so just amazing things are happening but
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:16.280]  I want to get back into this a nuke situation but but they admit that if they
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.720]  bomb the Bashir reactor and some of the other facilities that that will make
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:26.480]  Chernobyl or even Fukushima look tame because when you have reactors being
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:32.440]  blown up then they are going to put off some very nasty isotopes so we'll get
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:36.320]  into that with mr. Stein is an expert in this and Matthew Steiner in a moment but
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.160]  first off Switzerland prepares for mass civil unrest in Europe fears over race
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.720]  wars economic fallout prompt new military battalions despite being one of
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.480]  the most stable and economically vibrant countries in the world primarily as a
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:51.800]  result of its refusal to join the euro Switzerland is preparing for mass civil
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.400]  unrest in central Europe that could spill over its border by mobilizing troops
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.360]  the deal with potential disorder so they're expanding the troops and calling
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:05.400]  for more brigades the Swiss military is adding 40 military battalions to its army
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.520]  that will be spread around the country for purposes of dealing with the fallout
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.920]  for many widespread disorder that could arise from the crumbling euro zone and
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.520]  then he links to government ministers and others and professors and news
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.560]  articles breaking this down minister maruir accompanied by whispers from the
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:26.680]  top uniformed leadership in Switzerland is trying to raise awareness that
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:32.480]  Europe's massive financial political crisis could get very unpleasant right
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:38.720]  to John Schindler a professor of national security affairs the u.s. war
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:44.280]  college naval war college swiss military exercise in september called
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:49.800]  Stabolo do were based on EU instability getting out of hand the Swiss have
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:55.440]  stayed out of the EU on more things than very prosperous Swiss are gloating
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:58.640]  about these days and they certainly don't want EU problems spilling over to
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:05.800]  the country and it goes over the 200,000 troops they want to expand the last time
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:11.080]  they did this was right before world war two and the fact that in their papers
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:15.280]  they're concerned about race war and basically total collapse and muslim
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.600]  uprisings amongst other things again and then you have the british ministry
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:26.880]  report 2007 guys just typed in flash mobs british report and that's a lot in
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:31.560]  guardian headline that'll bring it up and it says total collapse of society
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:37.000]  2015 now again going back to our guest finishing up with the nuke stuff but I
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.440]  want to get your take on this I'm not saying all this is going to happen I
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:45.680]  hope it isn't but I'm having to get to the point here where more and more the
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:51.920]  events are now actually arriving and I was just watching MSNBC before the show
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:56.600]  and they were talking about China or CNBC totally collapsing from being a boom
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:02.800]  economy to collapsing and Ron Paul says time to panic over quantitative easing
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:07.440]  I mean it's just from every angle I totally concur with what you said I'm
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.240]  gonna give you the floor on this for the balance of the long segment here that
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:15.840]  that people instinctively know that there's a perfect storm of different
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.360]  events happening and that society goes through these cycles but we're going into
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.880]  a mega cycle that I believe is going to dwarf any previous cycle and all the
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:29.280]  bedlam we're seeing right now is nothing but birthing pains for the main
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:34.720]  event go ahead and get into the nukes and then EMPs what it does the reactors
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:41.680]  and then the tying into the Switzerland preparation well I agree I think the
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.560]  perfect storm is coming and like yourself I hope it's not an all-out
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.840]  collapse I mean it's not something I'm hoping or planning for and getting all
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:54.000]  excited about but I think intuitively that people all over the world know that
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.040]  right around the corners some huge events are happening and on a government
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:02.520]  level I know they have remote viewers and they look and see if there's a
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.840]  consensus amongst the remote viewers I'm sure they've seen some pretty nasty
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.680]  stuff and that's one of the reasons that they're doing all of the bunkers and
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.960]  doing all of the bullets and doing all of this I think that the people in
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:18.360]  government really don't want it all to fall apart totally because they want to
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.400]  eat and they want to live and they want to breathe the air too like we do you
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:27.080]  know so it's a combination of how much is orchestrated and how much is that
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:31.520]  there they just know just like the average Joe knows that the you know this
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:35.240]  big machine is not going to keep running that much longer at least not the way it
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:42.840]  is hopefully on some level it will keep running now is it I don't honestly know
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.760]  if we've got one or two huge black swan events around the corner that are going
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.600]  to just take things down like that like an EMP at the you know the good news
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:57.400]  about the EMP is it's more local yeah we'll probably totally mess up the
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:01.480]  United States collapse the government the stock exchange but the rest of the
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:04.840]  world will still be there the rest of the United States will still be there to
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:10.560]  come in and kind of rebuild things the bad news is that in the area of the EMPs
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.240]  you're going to take out most of the backup systems that keep nuclear
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:20.320]  power plants functioning when the grid goes down you can't just shut down a
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:24.560]  power plant like flipping a switch it takes for instance seven months after
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:30.480]  Fukushima if they lost cooling water for something like 36 hours they'd go in a
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.120]  full meltdown again so after a power plant's been shut down for seven months
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:38.600]  it only takes 36 hours with no coin for them to melt down again now now they'll
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:44.040]  melt down in 10 minutes when they first shut down but they'll melt down in 36
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:48.360]  hours seven months later so so you can't like so when you have a big situation
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.800]  where all of a sudden an EMP or solar storm collapses the grid then these
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.160]  power plants go into backup power they turn on their battery banks they turn
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:02.520]  on their backup generators and they keep things rolling now in 1960 or 61 when
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:08.080]  the Soviets did their EMP tests over Kazakhstan they expected that there'd
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:12.680]  be a pretty bad result but they underestimated it so they put all of
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:18.880]  these massive military generators in place in Kazakhstan because they
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.600]  anticipated would take the grid down with the EMP test well not only did it
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:28.800]  take the grid down in fact the EMP was so strong it induced currents in a thousand
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:34.280]  kilometer this 600 mile long trunk power line it was buried two meters at six
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:38.400]  feet under the ground 600 miles long two meters under the ground it put so much
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.360]  current in that that it burned the power plant down 600 miles away and not only
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:45.960]  that it shut down all of their generators now those generators were
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:50.160]  pre-microelectronics microelectronics it's like a thousand times more sensitive
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.680]  to EMP unless specifically EMP hardened and protected it's like a thousand times
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:58.880]  more sensitive to EMP than the stuff in those days because it is a thousand
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.600]  times smaller right it's a thousand times smaller so the traces are so close so
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:07.040]  you and it's like it's like opening up your computer and putting your finger in
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.960]  and rubbing your feet on the carpets and sparking around all the chips and saying
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.560]  gee I wonder if that did anything you know it's like chances are again you're
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.760]  not going to fry every chip in the computer but all you need to do is fry
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.480]  one key chip and that computer is not working now imagine you've got an EMP
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:24.920]  maybe you've got 30 or 40 in the East Coast nuclear power plants under the
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:29.560]  zone of the EMP a large percentage significant percentage somewhere
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:35.000]  between 20% and 100% of those are going to fail in the backup power supplies
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  and going to start doing Fukushima like things most of our power plants have
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.200]  spent fuel ponds on hand and if they spent fuel pond that's like the fuel
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:47.800]  rods in a nuclear power plant are only good for about a year or so I'm not
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:51.360]  exactly sure the exact date but they start losing power so they have these
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:56.440]  big massive cranes that go into the into the deep ponds into the water and they
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:00.000]  pull them out in a big bucket because it's so radioactive you can't even a
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.560]  radiation suit you can't get near this stuff they pull them out encased in a
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:07.160]  water bucket and then they move them over and then they put them into a
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:11.960]  spent into a big swimming pool like 23 feet deep in specially designed racks
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:15.720]  so that they don't get too close and overheat and go critical down inside the
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:20.280]  bottom of these ponds and then so if these ponds lose cooling if they've been
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:24.400]  recently refueled they'll boil dry in three or four days if it's been older
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:28.360]  fuel it can take as long as a month to boil dry but to give you an idea we have
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:32.520]  something like 95 spent fuel ponds in the United States an average of 15
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:36.880]  Chernobyl's worth of radioactive material in each and every one of those fuel ponds
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:41.280]  so not only you have reactors going off and they have an average of like one
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:45.720]  Chernobyl inside the reactor but next door of the reactors like in Fukushima
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:50.560]  they're in fuel ponds on in the upper floor of the building so they're blown
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.320]  up buildings and they're basically on their last legs and they've got these
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:59.400]  ponds just filled with debris and you can go to washington's blog.com just
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:03.960]  click in visual tour spent fuel ponds and it'll shock the hell out of you that
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:08.240]  stuff is all over our country so in the event of an EMP not only does the
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.320]  infrastructure collapse not only does it take down government and stock market
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.560]  immediately not only does all of our just-in-time deliveries grind to a halt
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:20.360]  all of our refineries are screwed up anything in the in the all the digital
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.840]  electronics that makes her world because everything is so strung out and and and
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.480]  so complex and also as you said just on time delivery let me ask you this
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:34.760]  question though we just put up a map on screen and I was also showing some
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:38.180]  government maps of where the supposed nuclear reactors are in the United
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:42.600]  States and others a little over 400 worldwide and I know that map and I've
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.560]  been looking at all the maps none of these maps show even half the reactors
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.680]  it doesn't even show the two nuclear reactors that are in Austin Texas it
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:56.120]  only shows Comanche peak but those are small I believe those are just small
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:00.440]  research reactors that aren't as big of an issue but you've got a hundred and
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.800]  four hundred and eight nuclear reactors in the United States 37% of the
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:09.080]  population of the United States lives within 50 miles of a nuclear reactor
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:13.080]  that means more than one out of every three American is within 50 miles of a
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:17.320]  nuclear reactor how many of these will go up in any MP I don't know well I
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:21.200]  will digress back I mean I understand the type of response if there is an
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:25.520]  MP or a solar flare that makes any of these plants have problems look at
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:30.320]  Fukushima their response was cover up what happened then just raise the level
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:34.720]  of radiation safety when more radiation hit us cover up the tuna being caught
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:40.240]  cover up the seals dying in Alaska cover up all the illnesses I mean more and
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:46.440]  more there's this attitude a million people the epistemological study shows
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:52.120]  that long-term health effects from Chernobyl that just one Chernobyl killed
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:57.080]  a million people worldwide died early deaths and three million people sickened
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:01.280]  with Chernobyl AIDS acquired immune deficiency syndrome the Chernobyl
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.560]  necklace is all over the place and parts of the Ukraine and and and different
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:09.800]  places downwind from Chernobyl that's thyroid tumors you know people with
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:15.760]  children born with bizarre birth defects huge huge stillbirth rates you know
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:19.760]  huge defects rates I mean terrible terrible things and that's one Chernobyl
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:24.680]  one spent fuel pond has 15 Chernobyl's worth in it when those fuel rods go dry
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:29.600]  they're encased in zirconium when zirconium gets super heated it burns
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.600]  like a torch it burns like a Roman candle it's like magnesium foil if you ever
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:37.120]  burned in your chem lab in high school you have to have dark glasses on it's
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:40.720]  super bright you know you have to shield your eyes each one of those spent fuel
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:46.960]  rods if it gets too hot starts burning in a self-sustaining fire radioactive fire
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:51.520]  into the atmosphere so you'll have burning fuel rods just like Chernobyl giant
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:57.520]  dirty bombs everywhere yeah I mean this is like thousands of times worse than
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:02.760]  every single nuclear device if we had a nuclear war that where every nuclear
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.960]  bomb blew off you know when we talk about Dr. Strangelove and end of the
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:11.080]  world it turns out that we have far more radio a radioactive material in our
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:14.640]  spent fuel ponds in reactors than in every single nuclear bomb because an
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:18.080]  airburst there's almost no radiation and what's there blows off and gets
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:22.080]  dissipated in the ocean we're talking about we're talking about the doomsday
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:26.440]  shroud the doomsday device that the Rand corporation talked about that was
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:30.680]  fictionalized as the bland corporation in Dr. Strangelove or how I learned to
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.400]  quit worrying and love the bomb yeah right and people don't understand we're
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:41.040]  not just saying this here this is going on now here's this here's this the thing
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:48.680]  is okay in my book when disaster strikes I outline both solar storms and EMP
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:53.840]  emergency prepping survival strategies what to do and in the chapter before it
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:58.360]  I also talk about the unthinkable surviving the nuclear catastrophe now
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:02.600]  obviously if it's like the worst-case scenario then it's kind of like you know
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:08.120]  you just do yourself and it's over but chances that it's worst-case I don't
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.480]  know you know but chances that something happens extremely significant like
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:17.800]  right now for the price of a single B2 bomber they could implement these new
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:22.200]  technology giant vacuum tube switches it would protect the massive transformers
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.840]  in our grid from totally frying and collapsing in the event of an EMP
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:30.080]  $2 billion nationwide right at a congressional study right two billion
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.240]  dollars nationwide the price of a single B2 bomber and they're just talking
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.480]  about it for 50 years they talked about rebuilding those levees around New
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:43.240]  Orleans the engineer says this is a disaster wait and happen it's not a
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:47.440]  question of if but when same thing with solar storms it's not a question of if
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:51.360]  but when right now we're rolling the dice if they come up snake eyes and we
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:55.760]  haven't protected the grid then it's like oh game over for society whether
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:00.800]  it's game over for civilization I don't know now I know we've covered this last
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.000]  time you run but it's important to cover it again but I want to go to break and
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.680]  come back and ask you why are they hyping into the world on all these TV
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:11.560]  shows I mean not just because it's popular to cover it why why are they
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:14.560]  pushing this meme but I wanted to mention this is we got a break here a
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:22.440]  Pompeii and of course so the city of Pompeii was a big Roman settlement the
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:29.520]  volcano was rumbling it had a few you know different eruptions over time but
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:32.920]  people stayed there and then they all got killed when it blew up and it's kind
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:36.880]  of the same thing throughout civilization people always just get this
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.600]  this I don't know what you call it a normalcy bias to the point of they're
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.520]  not worried anymore like GMO and things like that that are already killing us
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:51.400]  people just get where they accept it but I liken this to you know the myths of
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:56.000]  Atlantis in their high technologies or things we know that happened like Pompeii
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.920]  no in the arc you know it means the classic story some say no in the arc
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:04.240]  was Atlantis and the big flood was when Atlantis vaporized whether it was a
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:07.640]  comet or whether it was some kind of like super nuclear reaction who knows
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:12.880]  those are all legends from the past but it's a it's a recurring theme in
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:18.280]  history and it's a recurring theme in mythology and we're seeing it happen
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:22.720]  again and so what do you do you either be an ostrich with your head in the sand
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:26.680]  or you do your best to be ready and prepared to the best of your or do you
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:31.040]  move away from Mount Vesuvius I mean if the West and the northern hemisphere is
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.680]  where most the radiation is going to go crazy do smart people move to the southern
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:43.720]  hemisphere you have the money for it but I mean I mean is that a smart move for
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.400]  people that are retired or don't want to be around for World War 3 I mean would
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:51.760]  you move to southern hemisphere well you know it's not a bad move at one point
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:55.720]  in time I wanted to move to New Zealand because I thought 30 years ago that you
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:59.080]  know we were just headed down the road to nuclear destruction now I hear you
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:03.640]  we'll be right back the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:08.320]  months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:12.720]  belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:16.800]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.080]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:24.600]  the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:28.760]  by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:32.720]  ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:36.240]  your supply I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we

[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:23.200]  and free system rule books for that and support us getting information out look
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:29.140]  I hope they don't attack Iran I hope they don't overthrow Syria and put Al-Qaeda
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:32.420]  in but it looks like they're just gonna go ahead and physically invade the
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:37.380]  regular trips in mass and bomb them and the news will call it a peace action I
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:43.660]  hope that more reactors don't blow up but I saw a statistic 90 plus percent
[01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:49.500]  what 91% of reactors are now leaking of the 400 plus and that's mainstream news
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:53.460]  the ruling class has just gotten so decadent they just don't care anymore
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:57.380]  and I agree that they're not running the full collapse but the mega banks are
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:00.980]  trying to collapse economies to consolidate them and make governments
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:04.500]  do what they say and so it's like they can't help but collapse that they're
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:14.820]  like suicide bankers as Max Kaiser calls them but all I know is that we're
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:19.620]  sitting here looking at all this happening and governments are digging in
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:23.580]  what did you make Matt of the Homeland Security last month putting out that
[01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:30.020]  zombie apocalypse billboards and and the handouts and TV ads where you know
[01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:34.180]  zombies are coming to kill you get ready because there is this attitude of get
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:38.580]  ready but they say get ready with a week so when governments start saying get
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:42.700]  ready get ready is that just fair mongering or again I go back to this
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:47.380]  question and we were talking about the TV show revolution and founding fathers
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:51.540]  they have all these shows where you know societies collapsed or there's no power
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:56.540]  grid or other shows where the evil right-wingers won't turn their guns in
[01:55:56.540 --> 01:56:00.460]  so the government's got to round them all up and then I see parallels and real
[01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:05.700]  army documents for reeducation camps I mean what's going on I mean is this
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:10.380]  just collective craziness I mean what do you think is out I think the media is
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:14.860]  out to make a buck and that intuitively we all know we're in trouble so we get
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:20.100]  we like to watch these shows to get you know to like say okay you know is this
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:22.860]  really happening is it not it's entertaining I mean I watched a couple
[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:26.340]  of revolutions and it was very entertaining I mean I kind of blew my
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:29.340]  mind that you know the little girl is like three years old when it all
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:33.660]  collapses and then 19 years later she's dressed in perfect jeans and had her
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:37.020]  hair done just right and a nice you know leather jacket like yeah the world's
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:41.020]  class but she can go to iMagnon and and at least Walmart and you know Sears and
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:44.780]  pick up some really cool dudes and all the guys a clean shaven except occasionally
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:48.220]  now they're starting to grow a little bit of scruff but anyway it's it's good
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:55.740]  fun but I think just it goes beyond that people know we're in trouble so so for
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:59.980]  instance this weekend I'm teaching an urban survival skills workshop in Reno
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:04.580]  Nevada and we put it on the last minute with Dr. Richard Allen Miller who's the
[01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:09.220]  real Mulder he actually worked in Black Ops he trained Navy SEALs he developed a
[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:13.860]  program to turn Navy SEALs into Superman and on Sunday in Reno he's going to be
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:17.940]  teaching that for the first time anyone outside of Navy SEALs and now I've taught
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:23.100]  for years in both my books as pit of the stomach exercise to help you bypass the
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:26.220]  rational mind when you know what's hitting the fan and you don't have all
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:30.300]  the information CNN's not working and the weather channel is down and you don't
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:33.740]  know what to do and you're my same way maybe I should do this and oh no maybe
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:36.580]  I should do that well you got to shut that mind off when it's flipping
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:40.700]  flopping every you gotta go with the gut you gotta go with the gut now Richard
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:45.020]  Allen Miller has this process where you can train to shift into a different
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:48.660]  state of mind a different it's actually different state of consciousness or you
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:54.660]  can bypass time and space and make snap decisions with three sigma accuracy now
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:58.460]  he says that you test the class the beginning of the day and the end of the
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:02.860]  day and everyone improves by at least a hundred percent but the practice it's
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:07.180]  more like 4,000 percent improvement over just like flipping a coin and just
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:10.300]  making sure because the subconscious mind is a hundred times more powerful in
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:13.980]  the conscience it already knows the answers people think it's a magic but
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:18.060]  really you're just integrating all that data and I look forward to getting him
[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:21.580]  on because you you sent me his info that's very interesting back in 60
[01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:25.700]  seconds we're going to continue more looking at all this and get into the
[01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:29.820]  financial collapse angle because look at Detroit they're already the police are
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:33.060]  putting up signs saying enter at your own risk Oakland's saying they won't
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:37.620]  respond to 35 major crimes show the collapse is already happening at many
[01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:40.100]  levels
[01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:49.020]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:54.480]  Aaron full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:58.380]  small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade
[01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:01.700]  cheeses but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like
[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:05.540]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:09.020]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:12.020]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the

[02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:12.620]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:20.100]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:23.660]  Alex Jones
[02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:28.020]  all right coming up in the next segment it's gonna be your chance to talk to
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:33.380]  engineer preparedness writer Matt Stein the toll-free number to join us
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:44.020]  800-25-99231 800-25-99231 I gotta get you back on with your compadre soon
[02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:47.380]  you're associated talk about this pit of the stomach thing because I know there's
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:51.900]  a lot of research on that and in my life when I go with my gut it's never
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:55.140]  wrong when I don't go with my gut it's always bad and I finally learned in my
[02:00:55.140 --> 02:00:59.500]  life to ignore the intellectual I mean I intellectually look at things and I go
[02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:03.940]  off of it and usually it lines up with my gut but the gut is always I mean
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:08.500]  Christians would call it their spirit that's what knows and the gut always
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:11.580]  knows or someone say the nose knows you know that's another term for the gut
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:17.060]  but that's another issue I want to get into this financial collapse what we see
[02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:19.900]  happening under globalism the deindustrialization of the cities
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:27.980]  where do you see that going Matt down the toilet I mean it's we dismantled you
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:32.660]  know the the profit being the number one God you know here if I'm a CEO of a
[02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:37.300]  corporation what's my number one responsibility maximize profits so it's
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:40.580]  not my responsibility my workers it's not my responsibility to do the right
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:44.500]  thing for the country if my responsibility is to my stockholders to
[02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:48.140]  maximize profits so that means I take the jobs I ship them to that part of the
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:51.300]  world where there's the least concern for the environment the least concern for
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:54.660]  the worker they work in slave wages they have no health control and they don't
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:58.420]  care about anything except making the most money for the least amount of money
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:02.940]  so that guarantees the collapse of the natural systems it guarantees the
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:07.220]  destruction of the middle class it guarantees that except for the people
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:11.460]  at the top for making money off the top that everybody else is going to suffer
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:15.620]  because the trickle you no longer have guys working for 30 bucks an hour in
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:19.220]  automotive plants and now out working for six bucks an hour at McDonald's or
[02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:23.580]  Home Depot ten bucks an hour at Home Depot they can get that job so so the
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:27.420]  money is just not here to keep everything rolling except for trickling down
[02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:32.700]  from the top so I don't see any way it can go anywhere other than collapsing the
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:37.820]  world as we know it and people but the problem is there's so much momentum
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:41.500]  business as usual got us to this incredible world with this incredible
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:45.740]  technology and you know very few of us want to go back to like plowing you
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:50.180]  know plowing our fields with a horse or or a stick in the ground you know and
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:55.260]  doing all that manual labor but on the same hand the people who got there
[02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:59.100]  through the old way have a huge stake in keeping that going but keeping that
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:03.020]  going is going to collapse the world guaranteed so so it's like where's the
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:07.540]  solution the solution is major change when I ask people I go to speak in front
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:11.540]  of thousands and thousands of people and I ask them first I ask how many people
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:15.580]  think that we have passed the tipping point that the giant trainwrecks going
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:20.140]  to happen no matter what and it used to be one out of three people would raise
[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:23.980]  their hands now two out of three people raise their hands then I ask how many
[02:03:23.980 --> 02:03:27.900]  people think everything actually first I start out and say how many people think
[02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:31.700]  everything's okay we can keep doing what we're doing it's gonna be okay so far I
[02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:34.780]  had two people raise their hand and they were giggling like they really didn't
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:38.660]  believe it but they wanted to be funny so out of 10,000 people to have raised
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:41.860]  their hand thinking we can keep doing what we're doing is not gonna and and you
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:45.060]  know our computer models we can call the general public dumb down that's only
[02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:49.540]  when they're not conscious and kind of in lazy mode but crowdsourcing all of it
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:54.060]  shows the knowledge of the crowd is always better than even the top scientists
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:58.580]  that I mean you know the general understanding just like my snow when a
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:02.020]  hurricane's coming before it's even formed or they know when our earthquakes
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:05.380]  coming well I mean just like they've proven birds and fish have magnetic
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:10.020]  cells in their brains to be able to guide down the lay lines it turns out
[02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:15.260]  everything the ancients talked about is real that's correct it is real and you
[02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:20.620]  can you can Rick Miller like I had teach pit of the stomach he teaches in the
[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:25.100]  Sunday critical decision-making Sunday of our workshop he's teaching like pit of
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:29.140]  the stomach on steroids and I'm really excited because this is my chance I've
[02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:32.060]  spent some time with Rick but I've never been through the workshop so I'm gonna
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:39.780]  get to learn that stuff because none of us has only info yeah I tell you my
[02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:43.980]  biggest part of my brains in the bottom of my gut and I'm just feel sorry for
[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:47.380]  people that I run into that don't even know about the gut it's like you don't
[02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:50.620]  know about the guy and that course they're always complete failures is I
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:54.180]  think why I think that's what separates success from not having success is you
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:59.020]  gotta have a guy and of course with a gut also comes guts we'll be right back

[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:32.580]  got to get to all this other news I haven't covered I've mentioned it
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:38.260]  earlier afterlife exists as top brain surgeon that's the daily telegraph a

[02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:21.260]  anything about problems that are in the environment when you're about
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:23.660]  sustainability they have a full sustainability and of course the
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:28.020]  engineer who's on with us so he's the author of several books when technology

[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:37.340]  the line with us Matt Stein we're taking a few phone calls right now Jim in
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:45.620]  Chicago listening on 15 30 a.m. WCKG you're on the air welcome hey Alex great
[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:50.540]  show I'm listening to you on your am station in Chicago great move my
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:55.460]  question to your guest is as we all know the mainstream media is full of baloney
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:12:00.500]  and I've heard some things but I would like his take because he's very well
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:05.940]  informed on exactly what the state of Fukushima is right now I may have
[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:10.060]  missed it earlier if he already spoke about it but whether you're an act you
[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:14.540]  know okay his point sure of a basic breakdown of that anything else or you
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:20.820]  are arguing of us to hang up and answer it. No I want to comment on your I just
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:26.700]  want to make a comment it's irrelevant with this conversation about my what I
[02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:32.340]  was seeing with Rahm Emanuel in Chicago and just thank you personally for not
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:37.220]  bashing all of Chicago we all know it's the political system that screwed up
[02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:43.900]  not the Chicago's got awesome museums and fantastic aquarium and my
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:47.820]  wife wants to go back up there and visit on vacation it's got so much cool
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:51.620]  stuff I mean Chicago's great people I got family lives up there it's the corrupt
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:56.540]  mafia government ruining it and the welfare state financing all the
[02:12:56.540 --> 02:13:01.460]  gangbangers and disarming the people of Chicago so the criminals can run wild
[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:07.100]  you guys need to exercise the spirit of Al Capone and and and the original
[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:10.900]  daily out of Chicago and take your city back but look the spirit that's in
[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:15.180]  Chicago is infesting this whole country so it's definitely a love-hate
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:19.740]  relationship I mean America is still a great nation but we've allowed evil to
[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:24.060]  run wild and we'll get a brief comment from Mr. Stein on that but I appreciate
[02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:31.140]  your call sir break down your take Matt on his question about Fukushima well
[02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:36.540]  Fukushima's official estimates are like half of Chernobyl but unofficial are
[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:40.380]  it's already dumped something like two to two and a half times the amount of
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:44.020]  radiation is Chernobyl most of them in the ocean which is why we're not seeing
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:51.660]  it out here so much but it's huge in the ocean realistically people have made
[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:55.900]  comments like Arnie Gunderson and Helen Caldicott about moving to the Southern
[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:59.740]  Hemisphere if the spent fuel ponds go or more like when they go rather than if
[02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:07.300]  they go they're talking about a five to ten year cycle to develop the machinery
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:11.780]  and start dismantling all the debris and unloading those ponds and they're blown
[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:15.620]  up and they're sitting on basically rickety stilts right now ready for the
[02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:19.020]  next big earthquake to come through and knock them over or burn a hole in the
[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:23.940]  bottom of the pond now truthfully I don't think it's gonna be get out of North
[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:28.340]  America when that happens because I think they'll do like that the Chernobyl
[02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:33.060]  200 that basically gave their lives and took extreme doses of radiation to
[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:39.660]  encase Chernobyl in the desert cement and earth and sarcophagus they're gonna
[02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:43.340]  have to do the same thing in Fukushima if those if and when this event spent
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:48.780]  fuel ponds go but Fukushima is like a huge warning signal to the rest of the
[02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:53.660]  world to say look these engineers are smart they did they do the best they
[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:57.100]  can but there's imperfect there's all kinds of things in the world there's
[02:14:57.100 --> 02:15:00.820]  terrorist acts there's earthquakes there's hurricanes as tornadoes the
[02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:04.660]  flooding of the Mississippi almost took out a nuclear power plant they were
[02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:09.060]  they're protecting it was sandbags it was like inches away from flooding the
[02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:12.460]  control room in a nuclear power well now I read all the time about leaks that
[02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:15.540]  aren't even a big deal I heard it out in Southern California remember earlier
[02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:20.580]  this year they had a leak and a reactor Santa no freight is probably toast that
[02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:25.780]  reactors probably gone they put they rebuilt it with these new cooling tubes
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:29.820]  and the cooling tubes are corroding at an incredibly fast rate they don't know
[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:33.740]  exactly why they're doing a lot of analysis but that's like a major nuclear
[02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:37.380]  power plant sure and they announced I mean I know you know this they're like
[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:40.740]  oh we're just not gonna have alarms anymore and radiations released that'll
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:45.460]  scare you well we got the dumb alarms for a reason and you know what the
[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:48.660]  fellows make it so many points I forgot he didn't get to make this point about
[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:51.900]  Rahman you know what he's doing in Chicago to try to get back in sometime
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:55.780]  brother I want to hear what you have to say as a Chicagoan Deborah in Florida
[02:15:55.780 --> 02:16:01.340]  listening via the audio streams at info wars.com you're on the air hi Alex thank
[02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:06.740]  you for taking my call I think my husband and I think you are terrific and I
[02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:10.420]  have a question for your guests and have a question for you sure we live here in
[02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:16.180]  South Florida and basically I'm medically disabled I used to be very
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:19.780]  healthy and over the last 10 years I have a neuromuscular disease I don't
[02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:23.260]  know where it came from my doctor's a puzzled they don't know where it came
[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:27.060]  from you've been taking vaccines no none at all but I'll tell you something
[02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:32.580]  drinking aspartame and from whole earth we always used to buy food from there
[02:16:32.580 --> 02:16:37.540]  always we stopped just recently as soon as we heard the reports about the GMO
[02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:45.140]  I had no idea my husband also was very healthy not feeling well and he doesn't
[02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:49.180]  even take aspirin well I mean he's the type of person who just doesn't go near
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:54.980]  anything you know and you know down here in South Florida it's just like it's
[02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:58.700]  like another world I mean you go into the supermarkets the shelves are empty
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:06.420]  this it's just it's really strange everything has just shifted and we're
[02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:10.060]  trying to say well you know there's something going on here so how do we
[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:16.180]  prepare I've got to say I travel some around the country and and America does
[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:19.700]  in many areas look like it's in a depression people who are wealthier
[02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:23.820]  living their own little enclaves I'm not really aware of it but I've been
[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:27.140]  seeing that and you've got to want to bash whole foods all day they've it's a
[02:17:27.140 --> 02:17:30.620]  great store overall they've got a lot of great stuff the point is is that they're
[02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:34.940]  bringing more and more GMO in while claiming you know that we have nothing
[02:17:34.940 --> 02:17:39.580]  artificial you know on big billboards it's the false advertising is the problem
[02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:42.860]  but I don't want to just single whole foods out but I hear you and I appreciate
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:48.060]  your call mr. Stein your take on what she's talking about about about about
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:53.020]  kind of the rotting of the infrastructure yeah I mean we're seeing it all
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:57.620]  over the country and we shipped all the manufacturing jobs off off the planet you
[02:17:57.620 --> 02:18:02.100]  know I mean to other parts of the world it's happening all over James Howard
[02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:06.340]  Kunstler wrote about it in the long emergency and we're seeing that I mean
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:10.700]  you know I started talking about it my first edition of when technology fails
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:15.900]  in 2000 released Thanksgiving 2000 Kunstler followed long emergency we're
[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:22.340]  seeing that and it's happening and it's going to take doing rebuilding the world
[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:27.100]  and most people when I ask the question you know the optimistic doomers is
[02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:31.460]  people in my category when I say well how many people think that we stand a
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:35.380]  chance of shifting from total collapse and but we're probably going to get have
[02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:39.500]  to get knocked around really badly before either people take back the
[02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:42.380]  government or people in the government get so freaked out that they're willing
[02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:46.980]  to actually you know make real changes not little tiny changes not keeping the
[02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:51.580]  status quo going and now about one out of three people me included raise our
[02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:55.460]  hands and basically all of us most of us seem to think it's going to take some
[02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:59.300]  pretty serious knock abouts before we make the changes it'll prevent total
[02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:04.100]  collapse and so what's my chance of us prevent avoiding total collapse pretty
[02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:08.660]  slim but I think it's doable I think that you know especially when people get
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:13.060]  if we if we have an events that are really serious but don't aren't game
[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:17.900]  over then we stand a chance of making the changes of course if we get to a game
[02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:21.860]  over situation got a game over situation and then it's like shoulda woulda
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:26.220]  coulda's and it's too late sure well in many areas you got 30 million people
[02:19:26.220 --> 02:19:30.220]  starving to death a year up from 15 million just a decade or so ago every
[02:19:30.220 --> 02:19:34.340]  year for people in Syria being attacked by NATO and al-Qaeda it is the end of the
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:37.980]  world so you know there's the old saying of it's a depression if you're out of
[02:19:37.980 --> 02:19:41.620]  work it's a recession of your neighbors out of work but we all know it's fake
[02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:44.500]  economic numbers we all know the recession didn't in four years ago and
[02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:49.060]  and the globalists are not changing course Matt Stein thank you so much for
[02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:52.500]  spending time with us we'll come back and break down drones looking through your
[02:19:52.500 --> 02:19:56.900]  windows they've made the announcement stay with us

[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:11.860]  cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like
[02:20:11.860 --> 02:20:15.700]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:19.140]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food
[02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:22.100]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the
[02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:25.260]  beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and

[02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:33.180]  Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kimchi and in
[02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:36.620]  India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's some good

[02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:15.340]  exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really
[02:23:15.340 --> 02:23:19.980]  are incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to
[02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:24.340]  keep your power bills criminally high some have called this a conspiracy
[02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:29.060]  others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the
[02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:35.380]  conspiracy goes my video at 123 cover up calm exposes the truth and shows you the

[02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:15.540]  County Sheriff Greg A. Herron says his office would only use the drone during
[02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:22.180]  emergencies pursuing a suspect on foot or pursuing a vehicle in an area or
[02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:26.340]  search and rescue or disaster and for proactive policing like catching
[02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:31.380]  marijuana fields on public lands they do have infrared capacity and in grow
[02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:35.920]  houses one of the most valuable assets a live video feed you'd be able to see
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:40.900]  what the drone is seeing as it's flying but not everyone's a fan the ACLU wants
[02:24:40.900 --> 02:24:44.460]  drones only deployed when there's a warrant and is worried they might hurt
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:48.700]  privacy and people quote drone manufacturers are also considering
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:52.540]  offering police the option of arming these remote-controlled aircraft with
[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:56.860]  weapons like rubber bullets tasers and tear gas but Sheriff A. Herron says an
[02:24:56.860 --> 02:25:02.740]  armed drone is out of the question okay yeah and tasers are out of a question
[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:08.260]  too again they're just rolling these out on everybody they already have fixed
[02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:10.940]  between aircraft looking through your walls the ground penetrating radar
[02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:15.220]  infrared you name it I constantly see people being SWAT team because their
[02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:19.660]  power bill was too high and it turns out you know they have five fish tanks and
[02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:23.900]  the cops like two people live here and this power usage is what four people
[02:25:23.900 --> 02:25:28.540]  would use we're going to raid you and so even getting warrants now you know
[02:25:28.540 --> 02:25:33.500]  they'll hand them out for no reason looking for drugs that the government
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:37.900]  ships in on record the big banks launder the money for the reason they
[02:25:37.900 --> 02:25:40.500]  search you when you're flying back from the third world is they don't want you
[02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:44.460]  bringing in drugs to drive down the price and then they could put you in a
[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:50.220]  jail private prison run by big banks that bring in the main money see the real
[02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:54.740]  drug war is about putting you in prison to work for 25 cents an hour then they
[02:25:54.740 --> 02:25:59.860]  want to ship the jobs to China you could you can have jobs with slave labor and
[02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:03.740]  then that that'll also drive down wages see it's about driving down wages a
[02:26:03.740 --> 02:26:08.220]  race to the bottom a deindustrialization program it's not a free market it's a
[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:13.340]  rigged market and here's the report up at info wars.com Sheriff wants drones
[02:26:13.340 --> 02:26:17.140]  to peek inside buildings technology previously used to hunt insurgents in
[02:26:17.140 --> 02:26:22.100]  Afghanistan and they called it proactive policing you know because you're guilty
[02:26:22.100 --> 02:26:30.860]  until proven slave and look I understand that there are criminals
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:34.380]  involved in the drug trade and they'll be involved in something else that's
[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:38.780]  illegal so I know there's seedy horrible people involved in the drug trade in
[02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:44.620]  many cases but they're the low-level minions of it and when you send non
[02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:48.500]  violent people to jail they come out with no future they can't get a regular
[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:52.580]  job now they're going to join the ranks of criminality and this is how our
[02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:57.540]  society has become so criminal it's just a fact and if you want things to get
[02:26:57.540 --> 02:27:02.100]  worse and worse then go go with this but I've seen crime statistics of over
[02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:07.820]  90% of home invasions and armed robberies are drug related people want
[02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:13.980]  money for drugs and that's a that's a hidden tax where you get robbed
[02:27:13.980 --> 02:27:18.740]  because the drugs cost 10 20 30 times what they should if they were
[02:27:18.740 --> 02:27:25.300]  decriminalized not legalized decriminalized a procedure why is it
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:28.540]  that when you have a procedure to get something even if you've got to get a
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:32.980]  prescription or jump through hoops and pay taxes to get it why is it that that
[02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:38.780]  always destroys the black market because it lowers the price so much that
[02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:43.260]  people don't want to be in the black market anymore you introduce competition
[02:27:43.260 --> 02:27:48.060]  to it monopolies are the enemy monopolies in banking monopolies in the
[02:27:48.060 --> 02:27:54.500]  drug trade monopolies in any trade look they got rid of nine years of
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:58.020]  prohibition that absolutely empowered the mafia in this country with alcohol
[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:03.260]  in the 1920s and they the next year made a score of things schedule three
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:09.900]  controlled by the DEA because they needed something else to sell I mean it's
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:15.580]  real simple and they had all these corrupt cops on the take across the
[02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:21.340]  country it's come out pick a big city you name it the detectives and above
[02:28:21.340 --> 02:28:25.620]  drug dealing or keeping their mouth shut and getting a piece of the action and
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:29.340]  this is how our society got corrupt so now they'll put up with anything
[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:34.420]  basically shifting gears with some uplifting news after life exists as
[02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:37.580]  top brain surgeon London Telegraph a prominent scientist who had previously
[02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:41.580]  dismissed the possibility of afterlife says he has reconsidered his belief after
[02:28:41.580 --> 02:28:44.420]  experiencing an out-of-body experience which is convinced him that heaven
[02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:48.340]  exists this happens to all cultures it happens to people that are atheists you
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:52.500]  name it they see the same thing and I've had family that's died and seen this I
[02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:58.140]  mean you name it we have witnessed it doctor Edmond Alexander a Harvard
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:02.220]  educated neurosurgeon fell into a coma for seven days in 2008 after
[02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:05.420]  contracting meningitis oh would he take a government injection
[02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:08.740]  during his illness Dr. Alexander says that part of his brain which controls
[02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:12.660]  human thought and emotion shut down and then he experienced something so
[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:16.900]  profound that it gave me a scientific reason and it goes through the fact that
[02:29:16.900 --> 02:29:21.580]  he's a brain scientist he knows this that his brain was basically shut down and
[02:29:21.580 --> 02:29:26.540]  didn't have brainwaves but he was still experiencing all this something so
[02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:29.860]  profound that it gave me a scientific reason to believe in consciousness after
[02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:33.260]  death in an essay for the American magazine Newsweek which he wrote to
[02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:37.540]  promote the book of the proof of heaven I want to get him on and folks I've
[02:29:37.540 --> 02:29:42.460]  talked to atheists you name it who died and then you know been been dead for 10
[02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:47.380]  minutes and they angels the whole nine yards I mean it's real folks we see a

[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:08.780]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:12.300]  to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:16.060]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and
[02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:19.580]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of
[02:32:19.580 --> 02:32:22.740]  these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[02:32:22.740 --> 02:32:25.900]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:30.220]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:34.740]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:38.100]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now

[02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:14.420]  television study says London Telegraph that's also in the London Guardian
[02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:17.620]  doctors should curb amount of time children spend watching television to
[02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:21.940]  prevent long-term harm say pediatricians it's been proven not just in this study
[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:26.780]  but literally hundreds of others neurological disorders reduction in
[02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:32.420]  brain growth physically lowered IQs our next issue a big part of it is the
[02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:37.420]  zombification via television and I'm not defending the internet television but
[02:38:37.420 --> 02:38:40.820]  it's been found not to do the same thing because you are controlling it you're
[02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:46.620]  interacting you're clicking you're doing things but if you do watch television
[02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:49.900]  internet and go into suspended disbelief more than about five minutes then the
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:54.740]  brain damage does start talk radio print makes you image things we're gonna
[02:38:54.740 --> 02:38:57.500]  have big articles on this breaking down the studies in the next issue and
[02:38:57.500 --> 02:39:02.020]  that's what caused the zombification but but a new big study about they call
[02:39:02.020 --> 02:39:05.020]  it zombification I was gonna call this in the next issue and now they're
[02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:09.260]  calling it that because that's what it is the public has smaller brain sizes
[02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:14.100]  from television television is killing us the low attention span changing the
[02:39:14.100 --> 02:39:18.660]  subject every 30 second garbage and where people just sit there accepting
[02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:23.140]  whatever they see it's making a nation a world of spectators now somebody who's
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:27.900]  not a spectator is Max Cabrera Max I don't know how much of your story you
[02:39:27.900 --> 02:39:31.860]  can tell on air but you didn't want to tell this last time because you said
[02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:35.820]  well I don't have proof I just heard about it and saw it in Venezuela and
[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:39.220]  then we were reading Charlotte Isherby's book again and it was pointing out where
[02:39:39.220 --> 02:39:43.740]  in Europe they did this where they told the kids pray to God and ask for the
[02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:47.540]  milk in the morning the school lunch there's no milk now pray to the
[02:39:47.540 --> 02:39:51.860]  government and then the government can give it and that was I'd forgotten that
[02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:55.460]  was in her book with documents so the point is what you witnessed and saw in
[02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:58.660]  Venezuela and didn't want to talk about on air you're like well I don't have
[02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:01.900]  video so I'm not going to show it we do have some video you shot we'll show more
[02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:06.580]  on the nightly news tonight of you down there voting and I came to you this
[02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:10.580]  morning when you got back I said hey you know did you you think it was election
[02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:15.220]  fraud you said no they've made people dependent they've won just like the
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:18.740]  government's trying to do to get more than half on the dole it's imploded your
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:23.180]  country but just just tell us what it's done to Venezuela what 14 years of
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:26.460]  Chavez has been like I know you don't want to get into personal stories because
[02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:29.180]  you don't want your family to be persecuted but I mean they just take
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:33.340]  businesses and then put the commies in so describe what it's like living under
[02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:36.700]  this and what you think of the election of Max Cabrera who traveled back to
[02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:40.820]  Venezuela one of our best IT guys one of our head IT guys we got two IT
[02:40:40.820 --> 02:40:44.900]  departments he's ahead of one of them here at info wars what what it was like
[02:40:44.900 --> 02:40:50.780]  to see Hugo Chavez reelected and just what it's like to live under him well
[02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:54.260]  actually Alex I took some people we meet down to Venezuela so they could see
[02:40:54.260 --> 02:41:00.300]  the country for the first time and they did say your country is beautiful but it
[02:41:00.300 --> 02:41:03.500]  looks like nobody's taking care of it looks like nobody's really watching for
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:08.780]  for the well-being of a lot of the private sector and basically that's what's
[02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:14.180]  going on right now after 14 years we can see that the private sector has been
[02:41:14.180 --> 02:41:20.460]  leaving the country and people get dependent on the government and then
[02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:24.780]  proof of that is the elections I mean the result of the elections you can see
[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:32.380]  that Chavez won with 55 point 25 percent of the voters I was there during the
[02:41:32.380 --> 02:41:38.060]  whole process I was recording people voting and I was in the audit of the
[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:43.740]  votes and I can say it was really a transparent process and I don't think
[02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:46.300]  they do it the old-fashioned way of counting it right there and then
[02:41:46.300 --> 02:41:49.620]  posting it and then everybody can put the numbers together something chronic
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:53.900]  version and they have the fiscal version so when you vote over there you get up
[02:41:53.900 --> 02:41:57.100]  and you're a programmer so you know about this stuff exactly so I get a piece
[02:41:57.100 --> 02:42:02.100]  of paper saying who I voted for I put that piece of paper in a box at the end
[02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:07.220]  of the day they open the the election centers for everybody to go there and
[02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:11.820]  witness the counting of the votes I was there I did some footage of it that we
[02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:16.020]  can show tonight and it was matching everything that was oh here's some of
[02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:19.740]  it right now in screens you it looks like you snuck in with the camera yeah
[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:24.860]  that's inside the election center and you can see people that are on the tables
[02:42:24.860 --> 02:42:29.700]  checking for IDs making sure the people that are voting are actually legal
[02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:37.220]  voters and the process looks very very well what I can say from this is that
[02:42:37.220 --> 02:42:40.300]  people are becoming dependent on the government hold your finger up because
[02:42:40.300 --> 02:42:44.420]  you judge up they I guess have you dip it an ink it's very symbolic over there
[02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:49.060]  after you vote you have to dip your finger in ink so people will tell will
[02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:54.100]  know that you already voted and it's hard to take it off and we'll show folks
[02:42:54.100 --> 02:42:58.860]  your finger there on camera it was on Sunday that I did it and still with ink
[02:42:58.860 --> 02:43:02.460]  this is hard to get it off okay but I interrupted you I want to talk about
[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:06.300]  turnout some other issues getting back to this this dependence you know being
[02:43:06.300 --> 02:43:10.140]  born there growing up being middle-class what is the transformation you've seen
[02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:15.140]  we've seen it everywhere we saw in Poland we saw in Russia Ukraine China we've
[02:43:15.140 --> 02:43:20.140]  seen it everywhere the communists take over well I have seen that companies from
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:24.500]  the private sector were growing city I was used to living and now those
[02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:28.540]  companies are gone and everything is now under the government command of big
[02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:33.540]  companies and now those companies can make money so therefore people really
[02:43:33.540 --> 02:43:38.020]  depend on Chavez now Chavez is the leader he wants to take care of the
[02:43:38.020 --> 02:43:41.940]  he's like the mama pig with all the little kids mama pig with all it yes
[02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:48.740]  exactly and that's what got him to to win again people I see the opposition I
[02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:52.860]  saw the opposition going to these little towns asking them and telling them the
[02:43:52.860 --> 02:43:57.660]  opportunities that would be another type of government and they will tell them
[02:43:57.660 --> 02:44:03.740]  Chavez give us money and clothes if you give me more than clothes we will vote
[02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:07.220]  for you by the way guys we're gonna have a bunch of people in Austin saying Obama
[02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:11.580]  paid him to vote for him and stuff that's on the nightly news I'm hosting
[02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:16.060]  tonight and David Knight's doing the interview on some big breaking news the
[02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:19.700]  federal court has ruled the EPA is allowed to poison you so reversing the
[02:44:19.700 --> 02:44:24.140]  Nuremberg ruling this is a big deal some big breaking news tonight but can you
[02:44:24.140 --> 02:44:27.660]  guys go get your car ejection that one clip I played on the news as a teaser
[02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:32.420]  for tonight where the guy saying Obama gave him $200 to vote for him and and
[02:44:32.420 --> 02:44:35.780]  again government does this to these little handouts but these people you
[02:44:35.780 --> 02:44:40.100]  don't really think I got an Obama phone and and and Obama's gonna do more can
[02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:43.780]  we queue up the Elmo version in a way funds to he's given away funds as well
[02:44:43.780 --> 02:44:47.300]  okay so tell us about that so so there's a shot this phone as well yeah there's a
[02:44:47.300 --> 02:44:53.620]  Chavez phone there is a Chavez car and he's given away houses as well but they
[02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:57.820]  give they give the houses but without the title of the house so the house still
[02:44:57.820 --> 02:45:01.740]  belong to the government by the way that's the plan they say to bankrupt all
[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:05.740]  the mortgages even those that are paid up is to then bankrupt them and nationalize
[02:45:05.740 --> 02:45:08.820]  them and now you the government runs your house just like the great depression
[02:45:08.820 --> 02:45:13.020]  was used to get social security going this is a domestication process yes it
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:18.300]  is it is Alex and it's it's obvious I mean people are depending on Chavez and
[02:45:18.300 --> 02:45:21.940]  obviously when they see that there is another option they are afraid of losing
[02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:27.500]  what they have it's not too much I mean they are leaving off of petty cash I
[02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:31.500]  mean they give you a little amount of money and they feel happy with that they
[02:45:31.500 --> 02:45:35.940]  don't know any better Venezuela is a poor country 80% of the population they're
[02:45:35.940 --> 02:45:40.140]  leaving poverty some of them they don't have they don't have access to the
[02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:44.660]  internet to regular news and what they see is that somebody is giving them money
[02:45:44.660 --> 02:45:49.460]  so that's good enough for them I support that you have to help people people
[02:45:49.460 --> 02:45:53.740]  that deserve help they should get help but you have to stay open to the private
[02:45:53.740 --> 02:45:56.580]  sure they want to make you dependent though that's why they do everything they
[02:45:56.580 --> 02:46:01.220]  can to shut down all competition shut down the family the socialists have a
[02:46:01.220 --> 02:46:05.220]  model and at the end of the day they're not just well-meaning idiots they they
[02:46:05.220 --> 02:46:10.540]  want to get you dependent to then carry out the eugenics so it's totally cold
[02:46:10.540 --> 02:46:16.540]  blood do we have the Elmo Obama phone version and folks you think Obama phones
[02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:19.460]  good here's the Elmo version here it is
[02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:46.460]  if you're a radio listener will not watch in the streams we had that a week
[02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:50.140]  ago I never got around to it I've been so focused on serious stuff but they took
[02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:56.660]  that woman and then added Elmo onto it via a TV host interviewing Elmo another
[02:46:56.660 --> 02:47:00.300]  interview they they dubbed it over and it's completely hilarious if that we
[02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:06.300]  ask a don to post Obama phone lady meets Elmo on them full wars.com so the
[02:47:06.300 --> 02:47:09.820]  radio listeners can see that you know we make jokes about this but what is it
[02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:13.660]  like for you you know being successful here the American dream by working hard
[02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:17.900]  you know so I'm sure period 10 o'clock at night evil activity you know actually
[02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:21.420]  helping build info wars helping fight collectivism and the corporate board
[02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:25.580]  what is it like to then see Obama doing the same things you've talked about that
[02:47:25.580 --> 02:47:29.500]  hey I've seen this before with Chavez yeah I mean it's a we laugh right now
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:35.540]  because we feel really comfortable still but if people can see the road that
[02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:39.540]  Venezuela is taking how people become dependable on the government just for
[02:47:39.540 --> 02:47:45.220]  this kind of stuff people get distracted they don't see the big picture and at
[02:47:45.220 --> 02:47:49.020]  the end it would be too late to go back to something else that we really want
[02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:55.100]  because once they get 50 60% dumbed down wanting their Obama phone they don't
[02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:59.660]  it's like hey the industry left we're standing in line to get sausages and
[02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:04.620]  nylons like in Russia this doesn't work they're like hey I got $200 vote for
[02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:08.740]  Obama I got an Obama phone and he's gonna do more yeah that's right and they
[02:48:08.740 --> 02:48:13.100]  keep promising they keep giving people stuff and and of course they're going to
[02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:16.300]  be happy they depend on the government they don't want to work and that's the
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:22.700]  problem some mates over there they get salaries from the government therefore
[02:48:22.700 --> 02:48:26.980]  they don't have to go find a job so they should stay at home and they get
[02:48:26.980 --> 02:48:30.180]  paid but you described though how after four was it 14 years he's been in
[02:48:30.180 --> 02:48:34.300]  years I mean this we're not just saying this about Chavez describe how bad it's
[02:48:34.300 --> 02:48:37.180]  gotten though me but tell me it's just worse and worse and worse well my
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:40.660]  brother-in-law he cried when he saw the results of the elections just because he
[02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:45.460]  has been in two companies that has been taken over by the government I have seen
[02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:48.580]  I have seen things that are lacking I met your brother-in-law he's up here with
[02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:51.860]  who's nice guys yes he was a nice guy she's a professional he's an engineer
[02:48:51.860 --> 02:48:57.620]  and she's very qualified for for any job in engineering we've got a family
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:01.700]  friend who grew up the other dad in in Czechoslovakia Czech Republic under the
[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:05.380]  communist he was an artist they said we just don't like your art because he
[02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:09.540]  wants some art display against one of the communist kids so they just banding
[02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:12.780]  from his profession for life playwrights you name it I mean it's
[02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:16.580]  hellish to be under these people my brother-in-law he can get another job in
[02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:21.340]  the big companies because he's against Chavez now he has to work in a mall it's
[02:49:21.340 --> 02:49:25.740]  not a funny thing Alex I mean it's a it's a it's a hard situation for the
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:30.340]  Venezuelans so you either do you either kiss his hind in and kiss
[02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:34.780]  communism's butt or you don't get one of the government-controlled jobs that's
[02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:38.380]  right and people are not concerned because over six million people voted
[02:49:38.380 --> 02:49:44.300]  against Chavez now those people are concerned are they gonna take some
[02:49:44.300 --> 02:49:49.900]  measures against us now and that's what's happened might happen now
[02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:56.420]  Venezuela show a very good behavior and we are expecting Chavez to respect those
[02:49:56.420 --> 02:50:00.820]  six million people that voted against him I mean this is also what's the hope
[02:50:00.820 --> 02:50:06.100]  though that he'll just die of cancer he will die of cancer or people will react
[02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:10.540]  I think it's been 14 years I thought people were already looking at reality
[02:50:10.540 --> 02:50:17.180]  but they are not and we're hoping for them to to wake up and see what's better
[02:50:17.180 --> 02:50:21.660]  for them what about the military do they still worship him some of the ideas
[02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:25.180]  but actually caprily said that he has the minister of defense already he had
[02:50:25.180 --> 02:50:30.420]  the minister of defense and it's an active general in Venezuela so that
[02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:35.300]  means yeah the militia is with Chavez but not all of it there's parts that are
[02:50:35.300 --> 02:50:40.980]  with the opposition as well I mean how much worse has it overall gotten in
[02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:47.820]  Venezuela in 14 years the it's very unsafe that's the main concern about
[02:50:47.820 --> 02:50:50.980]  that it's very long tell us about that cuz you were telling me crime is just
[02:50:50.980 --> 02:50:53.460]  exploded yeah crime stay there we're gonna come right back and I've got the
[02:50:53.460 --> 02:50:57.180]  clip of the guy in Austin saying Obama paid him four years ago to vote for him
[02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:01.740]  and then some of your phone calls will do some overdrive stay with us a little
[02:51:01.740 --> 02:51:06.420]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:09.900]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[02:51:09.900 --> 02:51:13.980]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:51:13.980 --> 02:51:17.460]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:51:17.460 --> 02:51:22.100]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[02:51:22.100 --> 02:51:26.540]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then

[02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:51.740]  grow well I tell you the collectivist cannot take the spirit of art and
[02:54:51.740 --> 02:54:59.780]  literature in individual beauty they cannot take the power of Willie Nelson
[02:54:59.780 --> 02:55:04.540]  or Merle Haggard they cannot take the courage upon showing lefty and that's
[02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:08.940]  why they keep losing but now because of manufacturing this is what Karl Marx said
[02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:12.380]  he said we get to a point where the stake it just floods you with bobbles
[02:55:12.380 --> 02:55:16.100]  and people would sell out to the collective for that and you were really
[02:55:16.100 --> 02:55:18.740]  you're upset I've never seen you like this in the few years you worked here
[02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:23.260]  max is saying is this is devastating and you said you wish that you could say it
[02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:26.860]  was a fraud and not say that your country people had been turned into jellyfish I
[02:55:26.860 --> 02:55:30.260]  mean describe it your own words yeah that's right I mean after looking at the
[02:55:30.260 --> 02:55:36.820]  election results it was sad that people has been dumbed down to depend on this
[02:55:36.820 --> 02:55:42.820]  government and they I feel the problem is that they they only see their
[02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:47.260]  individual problems like okay I got a phone I got some money but they don't
[02:55:47.260 --> 02:55:53.180]  see beyond that what is going on in the whole country and I told the American
[02:55:53.180 --> 02:55:59.500]  people they really have to instead of only being worried about what they get
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:03.900]  like a phone they should see what the candidates are talking about what they
[02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:08.620]  want to do worldwide and nationwide because this is gonna affect everybody
[02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:12.140]  by the way you said you thought his cancer was a ruse privately and now he
[02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:15.780]  does look perfectly healthy you think it was staged I think it was a stage I
[02:56:15.780 --> 02:56:19.780]  think he got sick it wasn't as bad as they were saying because now he looks
[02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:25.140]  better than ever more powerful well they do have they do have near cures for
[02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:28.820]  cancer they keep from the public there's a big mainstream article out on a big
[02:56:28.820 --> 02:56:32.500]  study with magnets today and then they find the curators and they give it to
[02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:36.260]  themselves just happens to be close to the elections yeah no I think well
