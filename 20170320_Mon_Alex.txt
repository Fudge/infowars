[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:30.000 --> 00:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Monday, March 20th, 2017.
[00:51.000 --> 00:58.000]  If you go to DrudgeReport.com you can see the headline right in the middle column.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  It's been there since yesterday afternoon.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Trump and his family.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  Bombshell Discovery shows targets of NSA's project, DRAGNET.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  It's an admitted illegal project.
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  And now we've gotten basically the indexes of it or our sources have.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  It's Sheriff Joe Arpaio's whole case.
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.000]  Posse's had this for two years.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  He of course is now out of office as of last year, voted out of office.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  And so that information has now been put out via infowars.com
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  because the feds obviously under Obama did nothing.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  Well, there's a new sheriff in town in DC and this information is out.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  Trump talked last week about soon you'll see evidence of NSA spying.
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.000]  And this goes back as far as Obama's concerned, eight years.
[01:48.000 --> 01:49.000]  Eight years.
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.000]  But isn't it interesting?
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.000]  Now it's report.com the biggest new site in the world hands down second largest website in the world period after MSN.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  Top linked in the corner last night.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  Then it moved down this morning to the middle column.
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  NSA documents surveillance on Trump family more.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  Project DRAGNET.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  You'd think MSN would at least come out and say it wasn't true.
[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  Kind of like when we got the mic reports from the state police and then from federal marshals and other copy from a different division.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  Because they were all different variants, depending on who they were sent to.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  And for a week, the media ignored it.
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  Then they said it was fake.
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  Then they said, okay, it's real.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  Well, of course it was real.
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  I didn't just get it from my sources and believe it.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  I also called the phone numbers on there and the FBI is like, you're not supposed to have that.
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.000]  Where are you?
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  And then a little arguments about it said it's already out.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  Already have it.
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.000]  It's ready to be published.
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.000]  I'm publishing it right now.
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.000]  So there you go.
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  NSA documents surveillance on Trump family more.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  Project DRAGNET.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  And you know they've been scurrying around since yesterday afternoon trying to figure out how to respond to this.
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump is family.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  Yes, what's going up in the next hour?
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  We've talked to Sheriff Arpaio because this deals with him and a lot more.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  He's going to kind of recuse himself at this point and stay out of it and let the press deal with it.
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  That we do have his former chief deputy on the cold case posse joining us coming up.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  That's not the only exclusive information.
[03:28.000 --> 03:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone gave me this information this morning.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  And it is the Senate letter.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  I have so much in front of me that I can't find it now.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  We reprint me the Senate letter please put it on screen.
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.000]  Thank you.
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  And Roger Stone is going to be joining us coming up.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  He just had to dodge a bunch of reporters at his house.
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  He's going into the studio office right now is on with us in 15, 15 minutes.
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  And we have, of course, the exclusive Senate letter that you see in the press today,
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  where he is being ordered to preserve all his information pertaining to any contacts with the Russians.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  Of course, there was a hit and run.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  I found it.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  There was a hit and run last week.
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.000]  T-boning.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  He was poisoned with polonium before that.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  They want him dead before the Senate hearings begin.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  I hope three are in the charm and I try to kill them a third time.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  But here it is.
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  This is the U.S. Senate.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  Roger Stone.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  Maybe I should cover up his home address that's on there.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  He just told me to put the thing out.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  Let's actually black that out before we do that.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  Things are moving really, really quick here, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Obviously, this is real news.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  This is the tip of the spear.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  It's why we're under attack more than anybody.
[04:52.000 --> 05:00.000]  And if it wasn't for Dr. Roger Port, most folks wouldn't even know about the story the media once blacked out.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  The House Intelligence Committee hearing today on Russia in the 2016 elections has been quite the fake news anti-Trump double standard ceremony.
[05:07.000 --> 05:14.000]  Led by the anti-Trump team of Schiff, Comey and Nunez, the 2020 Globalist Democrat campaign for U.S. President has begun.
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  Admiral Rogers of the NSA could not answer many questions due to national security and classified information.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  The hearing was loaded with canned questions, responses, and lawyer talk.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  The Trump-Russia narrative echoed with, there was no wiretapping, a tax peppered in.
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  So now, U.S. officials are discussing the investigation of Russian influence on the Trump campaign and the election,
[05:33.000 --> 05:40.000]  but at the same time attacking Trump for claiming he was being investigated by the U.S. government during these investigations.
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  1984 double think in the flesh.
[05:43.000 --> 05:51.000]  Understand this, this hearing and all other related hearings or narratives are nothing more than the Globalist Democrat U.S. presidential campaign for 2020.
[05:51.000 --> 05:57.000]  They will try to delegitimize President Trump with fake news, then attack him on it the entire 2020 campaign.
[05:57.000 --> 06:21.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[06:27.000 --> 06:53.000]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleoformula.com.

[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  It's Monday, March 20th, 2017.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  I'm coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide.
[08:38.000 --> 08:47.000]  I'm Alex Jones with my amazing crew, and of course the wonderful listeners and viewers who are the heart of the rebellion against globalism that is sweeping the planet.
[08:47.000 --> 08:55.000]  The elites are striking back against our Nationalist President, who's already put $3 trillion in the stock market thanks to the confidence he's created.
[08:55.000 --> 09:10.000]  And had the best small jobs and small business recovery since 1984, has destroyed the TPP, their global government pyramid capstone, and they aren't in full piranha swarm attack mode.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  Gallup is back to fake polls.
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.000]  They have key demographics, key phone numbers they can call, where they can produce any numbers they want.
[09:17.000 --> 09:23.000]  Does anybody believe that Trump has fallen from 56 down to 37 in a national poll?
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.000]  No, they've waited a few months, still oversampling Democrats and others.
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  Then they call up with leading questions and make the president look bad trying to stall him.
[09:34.000 --> 09:42.000]  Just like I told you, the polls were fake during the election, and exactly what I told you turned out to be accurate because it's well known.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  I talked to people in the polling industry.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  I talked to the highest levels of the government.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  I talked to high-level Republicans, Democrats, you name it.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  I've never seen such a unified fraud in an election by the pollsters, but that's what happened here.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.000]  We've seen a lot of corruption, but it's unprecedented.
[09:59.000 --> 10:09.000]  So they're back just with a full press attack, trying to create the illusion that Trump's on the rocks, trying to create a bandwagon effect.
[10:09.000 --> 10:17.000]  And Mr. President, I know you were busy trying to turn the economy back on and shave the Republic and trying to rebuild our nation's borders and defenses.
[10:17.000 --> 10:28.000]  You've done an incredible job at 60 days in, but Mr. President, Mr. President, you're under full soft coup attack.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  I, of course, coined that term in the modern parlance.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  Limbaugh's picked up on that because that's what it is.
[10:36.000 --> 10:49.000]  There is a ongoing opposition party globalist media collaborator combine that is openly probing the White House defenses, that is openly getting the blueprints to Trump Tower,
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  that is openly training to smuggle bombs in.
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  That's been confirmed today.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  We're going to be covering that.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  You have to go on the offense.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  You have to go on the offense now.
[10:58.000 --> 11:07.000]  You can't take Congress to bowl at the White House. You can't be nicer by an end.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  These are scum.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.000]  They don't want to place the table.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  They want to destroy the country.
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.000]  They're parasites.
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.000]  They're trash.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  They're control freaks.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  And you've got to go on the offense about Hillary and the Democrats who have been openly on the Communist Chinese payroll.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  I know a lot of Republicans have burned them all.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  You haven't.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  You're aware of the takeover, the intelligence agencies are.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  The country's hanging by a thread before the election and still is.
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  And everybody's gone to sleep.
[11:34.000 --> 11:41.000]  I kept telling you day one, the war just started.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  This country is an incredibly dire strait.
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.000]  So is the world.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  Kim Jong-un has said he will turn the U.S. into ashes.
[11:47.000 --> 11:55.000]  He said if one shot gets fired, he's going to nuke Seoul, South Korea, Tokyo, Japan, and claims he can hit the United States.
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  And of course, you know, Tillerson, the talk of this already last week, now it's intensified.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  He said, okay, we may have to first strike and start loading atomic weapons onto those missiles.
[12:04.000 --> 12:15.000]  And the video is that they put up him, Kim Jong-un, this total wimp all walking tough with all his generals behind him when he's a total parasite, the definition of pathetic evil.
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  The absolute definition of a cult, a country run by a psycho cult of loons feeding on their poor people.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  This is government worship at its most disgusting, at its peak.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  Roger Stone's joining us for the next five, 10 minutes.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  He had to leave his home and go to his studio.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  He was mobbed by reporters trying to get out of his house, didn't talk to him.
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.000]  And he's going to his office studios to give us the exclusive, the Senate committee this morning.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  Over and over again, Roger Stone, Roger Stone connections to Russia, Roger Stone.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  He's been hit with polonium.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  He got t-boned by a car and a hit and run last week hitting right in the door where he was the passenger side.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  It's now been covered by mainstream media.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  They don't want him alive.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  They want to just demonizing.
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  We've got Comey refusing to answer questions about Roger Stone and Russia's possible ties.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  Now let's continue here.
[13:10.000 --> 13:18.000]  Here is the letter that he got the exclusive committee letter that you hear about in the news where they're saying that
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.000]  Roger Stone needs to keep all Russia related material.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  So he's going to give us that exclusively here.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  We're going to break it down coming up as soon as he joins us.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  But this is truly an incredible time to be alive.
[13:33.000 --> 13:43.000]  Now let's get to the story that is only on DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com.
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  Here's the absolute news blackout on this.
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  You've got these agencies that are illegally spying on the American people for decades,
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  intensifying major corporations like Google, probably beyond the NSA spying,
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  driving around with their mobile cars, breaking into people's wireless and stealing their passcodes.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  That's all come out in the news.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  Cars driving around with camera snorkel, scanning your house,
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  but also grabbing your passwords and breaking into your computer.
[14:16.000 --> 14:24.000]  This is the mega massive level of garbage that we're talking about.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  Now, as you can see, we're getting Roger Stone hooked up on Skype right now.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  And I want to get a clear image. We should probably try to reconnect with him.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  This is a war, folks. This isn't radio. This isn't TV.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  This is the defense of the Republic point blank against the globalist.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  We all need your prayers. We need your support. You notice we're in the focal point.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  I'm in these NSA documents being surveilled.
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.000]  My private office is being surveilled. Trump Tower is being surveilled.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  The only place you're going to see it is Infowars.com and DrudgeReport.com.
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  The only place with the courage to cover these documents.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  Bombshell Discovery shows targets of NSA project dragnet.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  Almost everything I talk about is in the news within hours.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  Media matters within hours. Democratic Party funded within hours.
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  Their institutions are after us. This came out yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock.
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  Zero coverage as of showtime 15 minutes ago as a broadcast kickoff. Zero.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  We have the documents. This comes from a federal court cases.
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  And this is what our PIO and detectives have been working on.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  And they gave us the feds years ago from their own investigation and a Snowden-like whistleblower
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  that came to them with, of course, the founder of Judicial Watch, Larry Klayman.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  And that's also the only other place to be having any of this is Newsmax.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  They've got a report on Klayman's investigation.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  I forgot to have you guys print that for me with this whistleblower,
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  but not these particular documents.
[16:00.000 --> 16:08.000]  But this is so big, but what's bigger is the total silence as they figure out how to spin this,
[16:08.000 --> 16:15.000]  how they turn, as they figure out how to lie about this, if they have to.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  If they have to.
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  They're hoping that everybody just ignores it and ignores drudgereport.com and infowars.com.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  And they're hoping that everybody's so compartmentalized and so tribal,
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Handy or anybody else, that they don't go cover this.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  Just like they hope with the Mayak report where the feds were trained to go after the veterans and gun owners.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  No, that was a real report. They had to admit it, but it took over a week.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  This has to come out today while Comey is up there in front of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  And they're talking about Roger Stone, and he three times refuses to not say,
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  we're going to play this coming up for Roger Leaves us,
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  three times they refuse to say whether Stone is a person of interest as a Russian agent or not.
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  Total bull, even though the Senate Committee and the House Committee have also come out and said,
[16:59.000 --> 17:06.000]  so far no evidence, but they keep repeating the lie and then saying no evidence of Trump being spied on,
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  even though the New York Times admitted it four times.
[17:09.000 --> 17:15.000]  I'd said three, it was four times the week of January 20th saying specifically they were spying on.
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  So the man of the month, the man of the year here, the guy they chose to pick out as the bad guy,
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  he's been hit with polonium, they tried to kill him in a hit and run last week, classic CIA style.
[17:26.000 --> 17:32.000]  And now here he is, it's like we're living in an action-adventure movie, but it's real.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  And we've got breaking in the next 15 minutes at infowars.com.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  The next 15 minutes, ladies and gentlemen, more documents on our PIO and his case being spied on by Obama.
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  Total felony criminal action with the documents, with the surveillance information on his home,
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  his office on the sheriff by Obama during the court case.
[17:52.000 --> 17:53.000]  So unprecedented.
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  Roger Stone, thank you for joining us.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  This is just a whirlwind of information breaking right now.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  Alex, it's been quite a morning to say the least.
[18:02.000 --> 18:12.000]  As you know, I received a formal letter from the US Senate Intelligence Committee via email very late Thursday.
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.000]  They said they've been trying to mail it to me for a month, but couldn't find my address.
[18:18.000 --> 18:26.000]  That gives one pause about the committee that's supposed to be overseeing our out-of-control intelligence services.
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.000]  Once again, I hear my name dragged through the mud at this morning's hearings,
[18:32.000 --> 18:42.000]  but I assure you that any inference that my interaction is brief and limited as it was and now fully and completely disclosed
[18:42.000 --> 18:52.000]  does not constitute collusion based on facts, timeline, and so on.
[18:52.000 --> 19:01.000]  So once I have the opportunity, I will lay that timeline out for the Senate or the House.
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  I want public hearings.
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  I don't want this behind closed doors.
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.000]  This chairman, the ranking member, Adam Schiff, maligns me.
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  A member of the committee, a swawa from California.
[19:15.000 --> 19:26.000]  They hide behind their congressional immunity, implying that my brief and now public and one-time communications
[19:26.000 --> 19:38.000]  with Kosovo too, a man who may or may not be a Russian asset just because the intelligence agency said he is, does not make it.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  Roger, I understand you keep putting your case out, which is a fact.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  It's innocuous. It's benign.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  So this is a headshot.
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.000]  It's a takedown because I was an MVP as you were in the election.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  And that's what media matters internal.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  And that's what media matters internal reports.
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.000]  That Project Veritas got out show.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  They're working with the White House.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  They're working with Hillary.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  They're working with CNN to block Roger Stone, the MVP, to demonize him, to attack him.
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  And then meanwhile, of course, we're all trying to talk to WikiLeaks.
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.000]  CNN talks to him.
[20:09.000 --> 20:10.000]  So does Fox News.
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  Of course, we're trying to talk to Goose for 2.0.
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.000]  I've had media call me for years saying, do you know Goose for?
[20:14.000 --> 20:18.000]  And we've got, we've got an email people claiming they're Goose for probably the FBI.
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  Of course, it's media outlets.
[20:19.000 --> 20:20.000]  We try to talk to people.
[20:20.000 --> 20:26.000]  But the point is, is that they've got you in a public chat room congratulating Goose for 2.0 for having their account restored.
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  So that's the proof you're a Russian agent.
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.000]  Meanwhile, they admit, they admit that there's no real connection to you, Trump or Flynn, to any of the Russians.
[20:33.000 --> 20:38.000]  All they have is Flynn lining up a phone call, which he was supposed to do once the president was elected.
[20:38.000 --> 20:49.000]  Well, and my exchange with Goose for is almost six weeks after the public release of the WikiDoc documents, which I am purported to have colluded with him to Lake.
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  Off air.
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  Off air.
[20:51.000 --> 20:52.000]  You've told me you're angry, Roger Stone.
[20:52.000 --> 20:53.000]  You're sick of it.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  You know, you use some fine language.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  You want in front of these cowards, these scumbags.
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  You tell me you wish you could sue them if they didn't have immunity.
[21:00.000 --> 21:01.000]  I mean, you're pissed.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  You're a red-blooded American that served this country in a great fashion for decades.
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.000]  So to repeat what you've told me off air directly to these scumbag faces, go ahead.
[21:09.000 --> 21:18.000]  Look, you know, yesterday, Chairman Schiff was all over saying the information regarding Russian collusion was, was circumstantial.
[21:18.000 --> 21:26.000]  So don't malign me in hearings, but then not afford me the opportunity to respond in the same forum.
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  That would be, that would be intrinsically unfair.
[21:29.000 --> 21:35.000]  I am jonesing to appear before the committee and clarify this matter.
[21:35.000 --> 21:47.000]  But while we're there, we need to talk about who wiretapped Donald Trump using this Russian thing as their rationale, their phony rationale.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  They have no evidence.
[21:49.000 --> 21:57.000]  This, this treasure trove of Kusapur-2 was dropped on me to elicit this headline.
[21:57.000 --> 22:05.000]  Trump associate admits communication with Russian hacker, misleading, salacious, not factual.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  Well, let me just stop you though, because this is so crystal clear.
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  They were in the New York Times four times the League of the Inauguration.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  On the day of the inauguration, naming you, saying we have transcripts of you and Flynn talking to the Russians.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  You get on live camera with us.
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  You say, this is insane.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  Live, you say, it's how dare them that they need to release these transcripts.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  Then I've never talked to any Russians.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  Then they come out months later and go, okay, there's no evidence of them talking to Russians.
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  The House Intelligence Committee head Nunes says there's nothing in the transcripts.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  There's literally not even phone calls with Roger Stone or any of these people.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  And so then they go, oh, there's never been any wiretapping.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  There's never been any intercepts.
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  They're insane.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  In Peach Trump, we never wiretapped any of these people.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  I mean, they act like we're morons.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  And now I want you to speak to that.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  And now we get the documents from Sheriff, former Sheriff, our Pios Task Force.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  This is all been in federal court.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  The feds have had this for two years.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  They've been challenged.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  It's all been secret.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  But now it's coming out.
[22:59.000 --> 23:06.000]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family going back with Obama eight years.
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  Oh, and guess who else is in there?
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  Alex Jones.
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  So they say they've never spied on anybody, Roger Stone, New York Times admits CIA affirms
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  it spied on the Senate Intelligence Panel.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  They admit that this very program called DragNet was used on over a million Americans.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  Well, now we have the DragNet interface.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  I mean, the DragNet entries.
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  And we've also got a bunch of the raw front page files given to us by law enforcement that show it.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  And notice how big is it, Roger?
[23:32.000 --> 23:33.000]  You can tweet an hour later.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  It's national news.
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  Me too.
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  They are dead silent on this, even though DrudgeReport.com has it linked.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  Right dead center since yesterday afternoon.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  What's that tell you?
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  Let's be very clear that these are related issues.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  Timeline you just went through.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  Oh, it's all together.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  It's the same thing.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  Exactly.
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  But here's the important to realize as soon as Donald Trump tweeted on his personal Twitter
[23:54.000 --> 24:02.000]  feed that he had been wiretapped, the intelligence agencies rap changed overnight to we have no
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.000]  evidence up till then they had all kinds of secret evidence as they kept telling the New
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  York Times.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  They're busted.
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  They're caught.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  They want this all to go away.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  Think about it.
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  Think about it.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  They're saying they're going to impeach Trump.
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.000]  This is unbelievable.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  Talk about over the top con game gaslighting.
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  They're going to impeach Trump when they're saying we were surveilling your people and
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  have proof.
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  He says that's a leak.
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.000]  You shouldn't talk about intelligence.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  They're caught.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  So then they turn around and say, oh, we were never surveilling.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  You're insane when we have thousands of newspaper headlines and them saying it on TV.
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  Sorry.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  Go ahead.
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  I want to lead to this groundbreaking story by Jerry Corsi today about widespread spying.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.760]  Put aside Sheriff Joe for a moment.
[24:43.760 --> 24:52.000]  We now know from these documents that through a program of wide data collection that Donald
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.840]  Trump's home phone number in his New York apartment was being monitored.
[24:56.840 --> 25:01.040]  His office phone number at Trump Tower was being monitored.
[25:01.040 --> 25:04.080]  His cell phones were being monitored.
[25:04.080 --> 25:08.080]  His the number in his private apartment in Marlago in Palm Beach.
[25:08.080 --> 25:10.600]  And by the way, these are numbers all known to us.
[25:10.600 --> 25:11.600]  You and I.
[25:11.600 --> 25:14.000]  So we know these are the real numbers.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.160]  And then the numbers at his various resorts where he would go to play golf.
[25:19.160 --> 25:22.320]  All of them had been monitored.
[25:22.320 --> 25:25.000]  All of them had been compromised.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.680]  They had begun this under President Bush.
[25:27.680 --> 25:28.680]  But here is the key.
[25:28.680 --> 25:35.480]  This is a program which which had several different iterations of code names.
[25:35.480 --> 25:43.120]  Trump I think his data was swept up under a task force called Sidewinder was that monitoring
[25:43.120 --> 25:47.640]  that surveillance continued into the Obama administration.
[25:47.640 --> 25:50.680]  So the question becomes not when did it start?
[25:50.680 --> 25:54.600]  The real question is when did it stop or did it stop?
[25:54.600 --> 26:02.480]  I still believe that Judge Napolitano is absolutely right that the peace pertaining
[26:02.480 --> 26:07.120]  to Trump is probably done by the Brits.
[26:07.120 --> 26:08.120]  They're the cutout.
[26:08.120 --> 26:14.480]  Their denial today is what they're supposed to be saying as the cutout.
[26:14.480 --> 26:17.040]  This is how intelligence works.
[26:17.040 --> 26:22.400]  So in order to be able to say we didn't do this with a straight face, they franchise
[26:22.400 --> 26:24.320]  it out to the Brits.
[26:24.320 --> 26:28.280]  Just me, we've done the same for them and other jurisdictions.
[26:28.280 --> 26:29.280]  And that's how this works.
[26:29.280 --> 26:32.600]  Well, I've been budding in here because this is all interconnected.
[26:32.600 --> 26:37.160]  It's incredible to see my name in here, my old private office that we had to get out
[26:37.160 --> 26:40.960]  of because of people starting to surveil it.
[26:40.960 --> 26:43.120]  Just all sorts of things going on.
[26:43.120 --> 26:48.680]  And then to know these were real and to see them not even responding, Roger.
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.960]  I mean, I had investigators calling me last week saying is this your old cell phone number?
[26:51.960 --> 26:52.960]  Yes, your private one.
[26:52.960 --> 26:54.280]  Is this where you had your private office?
[26:54.280 --> 26:55.280]  Yes.
[26:55.280 --> 26:56.400]  Is this where you used to live?
[26:56.400 --> 26:57.400]  Yes.
[26:57.400 --> 26:58.880]  Is this your family's phone number?
[26:58.880 --> 26:59.880]  Yes.
[26:59.880 --> 27:03.000]  Is this where you also, I mean, they had me surveilled all over the place.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.760]  And again, let's remember, because Trump was against the Iraq war.
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.800]  He was talking about running against George W. Bush in 2004.
[27:09.800 --> 27:10.800]  So they're surveilling him.
[27:10.800 --> 27:12.720]  It continues under Obama.
[27:12.720 --> 27:14.100]  And this is incredible.
[27:14.100 --> 27:19.720]  So here it is, proof Obama was surveilling him a lot longer than we thought and just
[27:19.720 --> 27:22.760]  zero coverage because they don't know what to do.
[27:22.760 --> 27:26.480]  So it's key that the listeners get this out if they want to defeat the globalist, Roger
[27:26.480 --> 27:27.480]  Stone.
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.400]  You know, Alex, the truth is in 2000, when I was the chairman of Donald Trump's presidential
[27:32.400 --> 27:38.840]  exploratory committee, I kept finding an enormous amount of our continued documents,
[27:38.840 --> 27:45.840]  not documents, but information contained in our proprietary online material in the media,
[27:45.840 --> 27:46.960]  constantly in the media.
[27:46.960 --> 27:57.840]  I suspect that even then, surveillance, we went so far is to have one of the hotel rooms
[27:57.840 --> 28:00.800]  or one of the sections of Marlago swept.
[28:00.800 --> 28:03.200]  This was in 2000.
[28:03.200 --> 28:05.920]  So I have always seen this danger.
[28:05.920 --> 28:07.920]  This is bigger than Watergate.
[28:07.920 --> 28:11.280]  This will ultimately bring the criminals down.
[28:11.280 --> 28:16.480]  Sean Spicer and Ryan Splebes are don't have the belly for this fight.
[28:16.480 --> 28:20.200]  They're saying, oh, Mr. President, walk it back.
[28:20.200 --> 28:21.200]  Apologize.
[28:21.200 --> 28:22.200]  Sure.
[28:22.200 --> 28:25.840]  They tried to walk it back and said he walked it back to the presidency, said, no, I didn't
[28:25.840 --> 28:28.360]  because it's known they spy on us to get around the law.
[28:28.360 --> 28:29.360]  We spy on them.
[28:29.360 --> 28:30.360]  It's an agreement that's admitted.
[28:30.360 --> 28:35.640]  Well, and his joke at the swearing in of Merkel tells you what he thinks.
[28:35.640 --> 28:36.800]  What did he say?
[28:36.800 --> 28:45.520]  One thing I, the chance where Merkel and I have in common is we've both been wiretapped
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.720]  by Barack Obama, right on the money.
[28:50.720 --> 28:51.720]  That's right, Roger.
[28:51.720 --> 28:53.880]  I know you've got to go very, very soon.
[28:53.880 --> 28:55.560]  For more entries, thank you for the exclusive.
[28:55.560 --> 29:01.520]  As you know more, you're going to be popping in at what, 130 Central, and that's 230 Eastern,
[29:01.520 --> 29:02.520]  correct?
[29:02.520 --> 29:03.520]  Yes.
[29:03.520 --> 29:04.520]  We've got a couple.
[29:04.520 --> 29:09.040]  We have a couple of camera crews that we have at bay from the local affiliates.
[29:09.040 --> 29:15.040]  And I want to make clear to them, just as I made clear to the Infra Wars family, I am
[29:15.040 --> 29:17.720]  ready to testify.
[29:17.720 --> 29:18.720]  Bring it.
[29:18.720 --> 29:23.160]  Again, total made up crap bull.
[29:23.160 --> 29:25.400]  This is, this is a fraud.
[29:25.400 --> 29:27.160]  This is a hit job.
[29:27.160 --> 29:34.960]  The facts, the timeline and the content will prove that there was no Russian collusion.
[29:34.960 --> 29:35.960]  All right.
[29:35.960 --> 29:36.960]  Thank you so much, Roger.
[29:36.960 --> 29:40.000]  Be safe because I wanted to say this, you know, they're going to try to kill you before
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  these hearings.
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  They're trying to kill you.
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  You need real security.
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.720]  I've got people ready to come in from Florida if you need help.
[29:45.720 --> 29:46.720]  So let's talk.
[29:46.720 --> 29:47.720]  God bless you.
[29:47.720 --> 29:48.720]  This is serious, folks.
[29:48.720 --> 29:49.720]  This isn't drama.
[29:49.720 --> 29:52.000]  Roger, you want to come back and say two more things?
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  You got to go.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  You got to go with the camera, Chris.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  No, I'm good.
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.000]  All right.
[29:56.000 --> 29:57.000]  Thank you.
[29:57.000 --> 29:58.000]  Be safe, man.
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.000]  Be safe.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.200]  The House Intelligence Committee hearing today on Russia and the 2016 elections has
[30:04.200 --> 30:09.000]  been quite the fake news anti-Trump double standard ceremony led by the anti-Trump team
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.600]  of Schiff, Comey and Nunez, the 2020 globalist Democrat campaign for U.S. president has begun.
[30:14.600 --> 30:18.360]  Admiral Rogers of the NSA could not answer many questions due to national security and
[30:18.360 --> 30:19.720]  classified information.
[30:19.720 --> 30:23.080]  The hearing was loaded with canned questions, responses, and lawyer talk.
[30:23.080 --> 30:27.960]  The Trump-Russia narrative echoed with, there was no wiretapping, attacks peppered in.
[30:27.960 --> 30:32.600]  So now U.S. officials are discussing the investigation of Russian influence on the Trump campaign
[30:32.600 --> 30:37.880]  and the election, but at the same time attacking Trump for claiming he was being investigated
[30:37.880 --> 30:43.920]  by the U.S. government during these investigations, 1984 double think in the flesh.
[30:43.920 --> 30:47.240]  Understand this, this hearing and all other related hearings or narratives are nothing
[30:47.240 --> 30:51.320]  more than the globalist Democrat U.S. presidential campaign for 2020.
[30:51.320 --> 30:55.240]  They will try to delegitimize President Trump with fake news, then attack him on it the
[30:55.240 --> 30:57.120]  entire 2020 campaign.
[30:57.120 --> 31:25.600]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[31:25.600 --> 31:28.520]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[31:28.520 --> 31:32.480]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate

[32:00.160 --> 32:05.240]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[32:05.240 --> 32:08.560]  before it became a loss to our modern diet, a processed junk.
[32:08.560 --> 32:13.800]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[32:13.800 --> 32:20.000]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[32:20.000 --> 32:21.680]  great tasting formula.
[32:21.680 --> 32:25.640]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[32:25.640 --> 32:30.360]  that are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[32:30.360 --> 32:34.360]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[32:34.360 --> 32:39.680]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full
[32:39.680 --> 32:43.600]  of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[32:43.600 --> 32:46.160]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[32:46.160 --> 32:50.520]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:50.520 --> 32:54.080]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[32:54.080 --> 32:58.600]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself, InfowarsLife.com
[32:58.600 --> 33:02.600]  today.
[33:02.600 --> 33:09.200]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:09.200 --> 33:14.560]  the Infowar.
[33:14.560 --> 33:21.760]  It just went live, Bombshell, Obama's NSA illegally spied on Sheriff Arpaio's prosecution.
[33:21.760 --> 33:27.360]  They've got the documents, the surveillance, Arpaio's house, his office, all of it spied
[33:27.360 --> 33:30.480]  on and used in the federal court.
[33:30.480 --> 33:33.840]  Again, Sheriff Arpaio, they're trying to put in prison.
[33:33.840 --> 33:41.360]  Wow, former federal officer, long-serving, decorated sheriff, patriot, Obama trying to
[33:41.360 --> 33:46.520]  put him in prison, using the spy grid to try to make up garbage.
[33:46.520 --> 33:49.320]  And guess who else is in the database?
[33:49.320 --> 33:51.760]  Yours truly.
[33:51.760 --> 33:52.760]  Isn't that just special?
[33:52.760 --> 33:56.320]  Yeah, I guess it's a who's who, the Patriots in there.
[33:56.320 --> 34:02.800]  I don't want to get on that list, don't you?
[34:02.800 --> 34:06.480]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, criminals in this government that have hijacked it at
[34:06.480 --> 34:12.040]  many levels think they own you and your family, from their perspective, they can try to claim
[34:12.040 --> 34:17.360]  that what Detective Zula and what Arpaio and others are putting out, he was illegal because
[34:17.360 --> 34:18.360]  it's secret.
[34:18.360 --> 34:21.160]  This was all brought to them years ago in federal court.
[34:21.160 --> 34:22.160]  They ignored it.
[34:22.160 --> 34:26.160]  And this is when they started coming after Arpaio even harder because they knew he had
[34:26.160 --> 34:30.800]  the whistleblower that had all this information.
[34:30.800 --> 34:39.760]  Now, we're going to have in just a moment, joining us, Dr. Corsi, then we have the detective
[34:39.760 --> 34:43.160]  joining us as well, who just does this of his own accord.
[34:43.160 --> 34:48.480]  Great Patriot, been through a lot, Mike Zulo.
[34:48.480 --> 34:51.200]  So he's coming up the start of the next hour, the David Hortle, which is coming on, he's
[34:51.200 --> 34:54.880]  talking about the sellout to the Islamist, and then Roger Stone is popping back in the
[34:54.880 --> 34:55.880]  David Knight.
[34:55.880 --> 34:59.200]  I'll host the fourth hour with a lot of the latest, obviously from the Comey hearings
[34:59.200 --> 35:00.920]  that are ongoing.
[35:00.920 --> 35:06.120]  And I'm going to get to the Comey hearings and some other clips here in just a moment.
[35:06.120 --> 35:13.960]  Before I go any further, I get in such heated focus going after these people on air that
[35:13.960 --> 35:14.960]  I skip network breaks.
[35:14.960 --> 35:17.480]  I don't even plug hardly.
[35:17.480 --> 35:22.000]  And we need to be able to expand in the face of this, not just stay the same size.
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.280]  But they're doing all sorts of things to govern us back, to strangle us, our reach, to block
[35:27.280 --> 35:29.320]  our sponsorships that we do have.
[35:29.320 --> 35:33.680]  That's why I moved away from sponsors years ago, because they can be gotten after, threatened.
[35:33.680 --> 35:39.400]  I mean, I'd have an event with Willie Nelson for veterans and firefighters exposing that
[35:39.400 --> 35:43.560]  the government was working with Islam in 9-11, they'd bomb threat it and they'd shut it
[35:43.560 --> 35:44.680]  down.
[35:44.680 --> 35:46.440]  This is the stuff you deal with.
[35:46.440 --> 35:51.200]  So we direct sell high quality products to you to fund our operation.
[35:51.200 --> 35:55.240]  So we've got the best water filtration systems, the widest selection.
[35:55.240 --> 36:01.960]  We have the best new nanotech, but also Kevlar patented body armor at the lowest prices out
[36:01.960 --> 36:03.680]  there.
[36:03.680 --> 36:04.960]  And folks know we're under attack.
[36:04.960 --> 36:09.720]  That's how we're able to get exclusives on citizens, nanotech, and defender Kevlar for
[36:09.720 --> 36:12.320]  rifles and handguns that nobody else can get.
[36:12.320 --> 36:16.640]  I mean, we're the exclusives when it comes to the nanotech, because people know inside
[36:16.640 --> 36:21.640]  these groups and development groups what's really going on, how the cow ate the cabbage.
[36:21.640 --> 36:25.920]  So the great thing is when the enemy closes doors, other doors open.
[36:25.920 --> 36:30.640]  But believe me, they put a knot on our head lately.
[36:30.640 --> 36:35.920]  They've certainly been having an effect and I get so heated, I don't even do the plugging
[36:35.920 --> 36:37.600]  I should do to fund ourselves to begin with.
[36:37.600 --> 36:43.400]  So you need to go to m4warstore.com today and you need to order high quality products.
[36:43.400 --> 36:48.800]  We're doing 30% off the highest quality, my Patriots supply foods, the private label
[36:48.800 --> 36:49.880]  M4 Select.
[36:49.880 --> 36:52.200]  That's their whole line of foods.
[36:52.200 --> 36:57.120]  It's super high quality, made in America, produced fresh, 30 to 40% off.
[36:57.120 --> 36:58.120]  Excuse me.
[36:58.120 --> 37:00.040]  We used to do this only once a year, but with North Korea, threatened to nuke the United
[37:00.040 --> 37:03.040]  States and all the craziness going on.
[37:03.040 --> 37:07.600]  This is insurance you can eat and with the inflation, that's obviously going to happen.
[37:07.600 --> 37:12.280]  Just the way the world works, especially as the economy heats back up and you get a job.
[37:12.280 --> 37:13.440]  This is the kind of insurance you can eat.
[37:13.440 --> 37:17.320]  If things go south, if they kill Trump, whatever happens, I think now it's more important than
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.080]  ever to have storeable food, 30, 40% off, we're only doing this for two days.
[37:21.080 --> 37:25.080]  We're going to end the sale today on supermilial vitality, 30% off as well.
[37:25.080 --> 37:29.000]  Whether it's a Trump pens 2020 shirt, everybody should wear these shirts at least once a week
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  out with their family.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.120]  Because Trump is just an absolute crusader for freedom.
[37:34.120 --> 37:38.640]  He's got such strength, he's so honorable, he's doing such a good job for the people.
[37:38.640 --> 37:42.960]  I don't mean to gush, but I just tell the truth, he's just a champion and they're trying
[37:42.960 --> 37:48.200]  to pull him down right now with his lies about Russian connections and fake Gallup polls.
[37:48.200 --> 37:50.200]  He's down to 37%.
[37:50.200 --> 37:53.280]  When I look at the big corporate polls, the internal internet polls show he's at about
[37:53.280 --> 37:54.280]  65%.
[37:54.280 --> 37:58.160]  He's super popular right now except with weak-minded people.
[37:58.160 --> 38:01.240]  Just like I told you during the election, he had way better polls than we're showing.
[38:01.240 --> 38:02.240]  It wasn't hard.
[38:02.240 --> 38:07.280]  The methodology is they add 10 to 15 to 20 to 40 plus points in some of these polls
[38:07.280 --> 38:08.280]  against Trump.
[38:08.280 --> 38:11.200]  Don't look at the methodology on the new Gallup poll.
[38:11.200 --> 38:15.040]  Against the demographics and the phone numbers they're calling, they've gotten past results
[38:15.040 --> 38:18.200]  from them and they're people that do polls.
[38:18.200 --> 38:23.280]  So it's totally skewed to look like we can bring down the president to make it look like
[38:23.280 --> 38:26.320]  the globalists can destroy him.
[38:26.320 --> 38:31.840]  So the president needs your prayers and support and the outlets fighting for the president.
[38:31.840 --> 38:35.000]  I mean, we are openly listed by media matters and other groups to be destroyed and brought
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  down.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.080]  Remember Cass Sunstein, I was reminded of that when he first got in under Obama, eight
[38:39.080 --> 38:41.520]  years ago, he said we're going to infiltrate the media and destroy him.
[38:41.520 --> 38:45.560]  We're going to pose as liberty groups and cause infighting and we're going to put taxes
[38:45.560 --> 38:48.920]  on conspiracy theories and questioning the government.
[38:48.920 --> 38:51.000]  We're going to go up to, quote, fake news.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.920]  They're doing it now.
[38:52.920 --> 38:55.640]  Anything that's real, they call fake.
[38:55.640 --> 39:03.880]  Notice they will not respond, ladies and gentlemen, close to 24 hours in from the top link, top
[39:03.880 --> 39:09.240]  left-hand side of Drudge Estay, now right in the middle column on DrudgeReport.com, the
[39:09.240 --> 39:12.520]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family, bombshell discovery
[39:12.520 --> 39:19.080]  shows targets of NSA project dragnet.
[39:19.080 --> 39:21.120]  Who else is going to bring you this information?
[39:21.120 --> 39:22.120]  Nobody.
[39:22.120 --> 39:26.320]  And quite frankly, I don't get off on the fact that Trump comes out and says, you watch
[39:26.320 --> 39:30.920]  next week, the evidence of the wiretap is going to come out by Obama against American
[39:30.920 --> 39:35.240]  citizens and I sort of get phone calls, is this your old cell phone number?
[39:35.240 --> 39:36.520]  Is this your old office number?
[39:36.520 --> 39:37.520]  I'm like, yeah.
[39:37.520 --> 39:40.720]  They're like, well, get ready, you're in an NSA database that shows you've been under
[39:40.720 --> 39:47.400]  heavy surveillance with the president, with Arpaio and others.
[39:47.400 --> 39:48.400]  It gets put out.
[39:48.400 --> 39:50.720]  This is from Sheriff Arpaio's investigations.
[39:50.720 --> 39:55.800]  This has been in federal court, by the way, for two years.
[39:55.800 --> 39:58.160]  And nothing, silence.
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.960]  And that's when you know you got big, big, big, big information, is when the corporate
[40:02.960 --> 40:05.400]  press doesn't even attack it, doesn't even spin it.
[40:05.400 --> 40:09.600]  Now, they're sitting around figuring out how to punch holes in it, but we've got them
[40:09.600 --> 40:12.840]  admitting the parallel construction in Reuters and AP.
[40:12.840 --> 40:16.040]  We've got them admitting that they were already targeting your political enemies.
[40:16.040 --> 40:17.040]  Remember?
[40:17.040 --> 40:20.160]  Roger Stone had a FISA open on him.
[40:20.160 --> 40:23.320]  They said they were surveilling Trump and they said, oh no, we weren't.
[40:23.320 --> 40:26.400]  When it turned out there was nothing there and he pointed out, you just leaked that you
[40:26.400 --> 40:27.400]  had me under surveillance.
[40:27.400 --> 40:28.400]  He's got them either way.
[40:28.400 --> 40:30.920]  I think he's got them that say leaked surveillance.
[40:30.920 --> 40:32.520]  Turns out though, there's nothing in the surveillance.
[40:32.520 --> 40:33.520]  So what do they say?
[40:33.520 --> 40:38.040]  We didn't surveil anybody, even though they were in thousands of headlines for the New
[40:38.040 --> 40:39.440]  York Times, The Washington Post.
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.840]  We found one writer, Rosenberg, four times the week of January 20th.
[40:44.840 --> 40:51.120]  Four times saying this.
[40:51.120 --> 40:55.120]  And of course, we pointed out and then CNN goes, oh my God, Alex Jones is so crazy.
[40:55.120 --> 40:57.560]  He put this out and then Trump picks it up and tweeted it.
[40:57.560 --> 40:58.560]  No he didn't.
[40:58.560 --> 41:02.200]  That's one thing Trump doesn't do is a lot of screenshots of headlines.
[41:02.200 --> 41:05.360]  He should have done that in his tweets or had a link to whitehouse.gov where he puts
[41:05.360 --> 41:08.560]  his own articles, where he shows because they just say, oh, he's crazy.
[41:08.560 --> 41:09.560]  See his tweet.
[41:09.560 --> 41:15.480]  Where's the proof in some lawyer game like the tweet itself is the compendium of information.
[41:15.480 --> 41:16.480]  This is so huge.
[41:16.480 --> 41:17.480]  You've got to go to drudgerport.com.
[41:17.480 --> 41:21.360]  You've got to get it out to everyone you know.
[41:21.360 --> 41:25.760]  You've got to go to infowars.com and get the new article that just broke 15 minutes ago.
[41:25.760 --> 41:29.880]  Yeah, Matthew Rosenberg, Obama.
[41:29.880 --> 41:36.080]  Obama's NSA illegally spied on Sheriff Arpaio's prosecution.
[41:36.080 --> 41:41.080]  Draw parallels to Obama's wiretapping of Trump.
[41:41.080 --> 41:48.560]  Absolutely.
[41:48.560 --> 41:53.080]  And that's actually, of course, he's note, we're moving so fast here on the deal.
[41:53.080 --> 41:58.080]  My note back to him that I wanted to add a section to it about tying it to that it's
[41:58.080 --> 42:01.680]  all part of the larger drag-down operation and also we have a new operation we've learned
[42:01.680 --> 42:02.680]  of.
[42:02.680 --> 42:03.680]  We're going to be giving you more in the next few days.
[42:03.680 --> 42:05.920]  Operation Sidewinder.
[42:05.920 --> 42:10.320]  So they brag everybody's under surveillance.
[42:10.320 --> 42:12.320]  Trump speaks out against it and they go, you're insane.
[42:12.320 --> 42:13.320]  There's no such thing.
[42:13.320 --> 42:18.240]  Just like they say, you can keep your doctor, Obama cares free.
[42:18.240 --> 42:20.420]  You didn't build that business.
[42:20.420 --> 42:22.080]  Somebody else did it.
[42:22.080 --> 42:23.320]  I never said that, Obama said.
[42:23.320 --> 42:24.920]  I never said you can keep your doctor.
[42:24.920 --> 42:28.120]  I never said, I never said you didn't build your business.
[42:28.120 --> 42:35.360]  Gruber, thank God the public's so dumb, remember him?
[42:35.360 --> 42:36.360]  And Trump is so responsive.
[42:36.360 --> 42:41.120]  I told the audience two weeks ago, tweet at Trump, tell him to bring up Gruber again to
[42:41.120 --> 42:43.240]  remind folks about healthcare and how they're scamming us.
[42:43.240 --> 42:44.240]  Trump does it.
[42:44.240 --> 42:45.240]  He's responsive, folks.
[42:45.240 --> 42:47.000]  He's listening to you, not just me.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.720]  We're going to Dr. Corsi right now.
[42:48.720 --> 42:55.240]  But this story is so important upon infowars.com, we've got a link to the story that's linked
[42:55.240 --> 42:56.240]  on drudgerport.com.
[42:56.240 --> 43:02.360]  And I got to tell you, who's the only other big outlet that isn't cowardly or who isn't
[43:02.360 --> 43:04.880]  so competitive they won't give another news organization attention.
[43:04.880 --> 43:10.200]  I could care less about getting the scoop for myself.
[43:10.200 --> 43:11.720]  For the country, I totally care.
[43:11.720 --> 43:14.120]  I would love it if it was Breitbart or World Net Daily.
[43:14.120 --> 43:15.120]  I would love it.
[43:15.120 --> 43:16.120]  Okay.
[43:16.120 --> 43:18.440]  I'm not competitive with other news outlets.
[43:18.440 --> 43:19.840]  I want to defeat the globalist.
[43:19.840 --> 43:25.360]  I'm in a total war, a death battle, as they call it.
[43:25.360 --> 43:26.960]  I said six months ago, it's a death battle.
[43:26.960 --> 43:27.960]  Now they use that term.
[43:27.960 --> 43:30.400]  They go, we're in a death battle with Trump and the nationalist.
[43:30.400 --> 43:32.520]  Yes, they're not going to back off.
[43:32.520 --> 43:36.600]  They're not going to let us operate and live, folks, politically.
[43:36.600 --> 43:38.040]  They mean business.
[43:38.040 --> 43:39.520]  They think that we're winning.
[43:39.520 --> 43:40.520]  They're panicked.
[43:40.520 --> 43:42.320]  We're not seeing their full attack.
[43:42.320 --> 43:44.400]  We break them now.
[43:44.400 --> 43:46.760]  We break them for a long time.
[43:46.760 --> 43:49.240]  This is the critical juncture.
[43:49.240 --> 43:53.200]  So let's recap what happened yesterday.
[43:53.200 --> 43:59.880]  Let's recap what happened yesterday and recap that, to give them credit, Newsmax and Larry
[43:59.880 --> 44:03.320]  Claimman, who's been at the center of this, I'm only claiming as soon as possible, they're
[44:03.320 --> 44:07.120]  the ones that got the documents, and then they were able to interface them with Arpaio
[44:07.120 --> 44:11.080]  that show all this and they've got a report on the whistleblower himself.
[44:11.080 --> 44:12.080]  It's like another Snowden.
[44:12.080 --> 44:13.080]  He was a contractor.
[44:13.080 --> 44:14.080]  So I need that info.
[44:14.080 --> 44:15.080]  I got it last night.
[44:15.080 --> 44:16.080]  I need it.
[44:16.080 --> 44:18.880]  If you don't know where it is, just go to your stage interview with Zulob.
[44:18.880 --> 44:20.080]  He talks about it in the first two minutes.
[44:20.080 --> 44:21.080]  I need it bad.
[44:21.080 --> 44:22.080]  India, I need it.
[44:22.080 --> 44:23.080]  Uber bad.
[44:23.080 --> 44:30.320]  Now, going to Dr. Horsey, formerly of WorldNet Daily, great outfit as well, three-time, number
[44:30.320 --> 44:36.040]  one New York Times bestseller, author, award-winning investigative journalist, Harvard expert, of
[44:36.040 --> 44:39.800]  course, on finance and more, state department, anti-terrorism, we'll just leave it at that.
[44:39.800 --> 44:44.800]  Dr. Horsey, I've never, in my 22 years, never been such a whirlwind of breaking info.
[44:44.800 --> 44:48.600]  In the real media, this is a firestorm, but outside of it, zero crickets.
[44:48.600 --> 44:55.280]  Well, first of all, what we did last night in terms of showing that Donald Trump was
[44:55.280 --> 45:00.720]  wiretapped, starting in 2004, and producing that evidence has gone viral.
[45:00.720 --> 45:06.560]  Now, the mainstream media, I think, has really had a loss for how to respond to this, because
[45:06.560 --> 45:13.200]  it beats their narrative, the phone numbers on that list are authentic.
[45:13.200 --> 45:18.520]  They are phone numbers, including Donald Trump's cell phone, his employees, his family, his
[45:18.520 --> 45:20.080]  wife was being wiretapped.
[45:20.080 --> 45:26.040]  This all comes from Operation Dragnet, which was an NSA operation, I think is still probably
[45:26.040 --> 45:27.040]  going on.
[45:27.040 --> 45:32.720]  I don't know if they ever really ended it, and it ends, you know, Comey is sitting in
[45:32.720 --> 45:37.120]  front of the House Intelligence Committee parsing words, he's saying, I don't have any
[45:37.120 --> 45:40.400]  evidence that Obama ordered the wiretapping.
[45:40.400 --> 45:44.960]  Well, the point is, under the law, the president doesn't order the wiretapping.
[45:44.960 --> 45:52.520]  If somebody had asked Comey, FBI director, well, in fact, was Donald Trump wiretapped
[45:52.520 --> 45:55.680]  in this period of time, Comey would have to say yes, of course.
[45:55.680 --> 45:56.680]  You didn't ask me that question.
[45:56.680 --> 45:59.280]  You just asked me if Obama ordered it.
[45:59.280 --> 46:04.520]  Well, you know, Obama not ordering it is kind of like the Watergate defense, when Richard
[46:04.520 --> 46:06.640]  Nixon said, I didn't order the break-in.
[46:06.640 --> 46:11.560]  You know, he still was impeached because he was in the process of being impeached, because
[46:11.560 --> 46:19.040]  he, you know, did not and would not pass up to his responsibility for encouraging his
[46:19.040 --> 46:21.040]  operatives to wiretapping.
[46:21.040 --> 46:22.040]  That's right.
[46:22.040 --> 46:23.040]  Let's be clear.
[46:23.040 --> 46:24.040]  That's key.
[46:24.040 --> 46:26.120]  The Republicans and Democrats are all out to get Trump up there.
[46:26.120 --> 46:29.600]  They're all parsing words and prescriptive stuff with Comey, it's totally clear, giving
[46:29.600 --> 46:32.880]  him the softball questions to get out of answering truthfully.
[46:32.880 --> 46:39.840]  Yeah, it's truthfully disinformation, because Comey knows that Trump was wiretapped and
[46:39.840 --> 46:44.560]  extensively since 2004 that it went on during the Obama administration.
[46:44.560 --> 46:46.360]  We have no indication it ever quit.
[46:46.360 --> 46:52.720]  Whether we have Trump's cell phone numbers, his family numbers, his employee numbers,
[46:52.720 --> 46:55.720]  all these different locations, it's a farce.
[46:55.720 --> 46:58.360]  And Comey knows it's a farce.
[46:58.360 --> 47:03.080]  What they won't do is they won't expose the fact there's massive illegal activity that's
[47:03.080 --> 47:09.080]  been going on in the NSA and in the Department of Justice over wiretapping and other surveillance
[47:09.080 --> 47:16.840]  of individual Americans, millions and millions, with the data collected, not just metadata,
[47:16.840 --> 47:22.600]  but the data collected at conversations, emails, financial records, credit card records.
[47:22.600 --> 47:23.600]  Sure.
[47:23.600 --> 47:24.600]  Let me expose this as well.
[47:24.600 --> 47:31.240]  Newsmax, Larry Klayman, Nunez must ask FBS Comey about Montgomery mass surveillance case.
[47:31.240 --> 47:33.320]  That's what was brought to Arpaio and others.
[47:33.320 --> 47:34.680]  That's where the documents come from.
[47:34.680 --> 47:35.960]  We've checked the numbers, checked it all.
[47:35.960 --> 47:42.280]  It is an NSA system, similar to the ones they're using in the DEA with access to the NSA database.
[47:42.280 --> 47:50.760]  That all came out in the parallel production, parallel structuring cases where they are
[47:50.760 --> 47:55.960]  pretending like they're not illegally spying via the NSA, and then going in parallel construction
[47:55.960 --> 48:01.240]  creating new fake cases based on the illegally obtained surveillance.
[48:01.240 --> 48:05.320]  We're going to link to this Newsmax story in our article as well.
[48:05.320 --> 48:09.960]  But this is so huge that, again, they would say they're surveilling Trump and have the
[48:09.960 --> 48:10.960]  proof.
[48:10.960 --> 48:12.560]  Trump goes, well, it's illegal to say you had that.
[48:12.560 --> 48:13.560]  He has them.
[48:13.560 --> 48:14.560]  Dead to rights.
[48:14.560 --> 48:15.560]  It's felonies.
[48:15.560 --> 48:19.600]  Those felony leaks, and they've asked those questions today and the NSA director admitted
[48:19.600 --> 48:21.400]  that, that it's very serious.
[48:21.400 --> 48:26.040]  Then they turn around and say, okay, we never had the evidence, plus we weren't surveilling.
[48:26.040 --> 48:27.040]  You're crazy.
[48:27.040 --> 48:29.400]  And then the media acts like Trump's been caught in something.
[48:29.400 --> 48:30.400]  It's insane.
[48:30.400 --> 48:36.560]  Well, and also, look, what we have on today, the new article we just broke, where we have,
[48:36.560 --> 48:42.320]  in fact, today we're able to publish the phone numbers and the IP addresses, because this
[48:42.320 --> 48:44.960]  document was made public in a federal court.
[48:44.960 --> 48:49.920]  And by the way, no one in the federal government's ever come by to repudiate this.
[48:49.920 --> 48:52.560]  It's been offered to say, please prove this is false.
[48:52.560 --> 48:53.560]  They haven't done it.
[48:53.560 --> 48:57.960]  They haven't done it with the database from Montgomery that we revealed yesterday.
[48:57.960 --> 49:03.600]  Now, what this shows is that the Department of Justice, when they were prosecuting Sheriff
[49:03.600 --> 49:08.960]  R. Pyle, were also wiretapping and talking to the judge.
[49:08.960 --> 49:13.400]  The Department of Justice was calling and speaking with Judge Murray Snow, when the
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.480]  judge was put in to handle the case, even though he'd made very derogatory statements.
[49:17.480 --> 49:18.480]  No, no, no.
[49:18.480 --> 49:20.280]  Let's talk about how R. Pyle got this information.
[49:20.280 --> 49:23.240]  Well, again, this is all was created.
[49:23.240 --> 49:28.520]  What they did is they asked Montgomery to basically reconstruct, go in and reconstruct
[49:28.520 --> 49:30.320]  what was happening in the case.
[49:30.320 --> 49:34.480]  And this was put together by the same whistleblower who said, you want to know what's happening?
[49:34.480 --> 49:37.080]  The DOJ is talking to the judge.
[49:37.080 --> 49:39.280]  Here are the phone numbers that are being used.
[49:39.280 --> 49:43.960]  You can see the phone numbers from Washington calling the Department of Justice into the
[49:43.960 --> 49:44.960]  judge's office.
[49:44.960 --> 49:48.080]  I'd like to find anybody to show those aren't the right numbers.
[49:48.080 --> 49:50.920]  And then you've got the IP addresses.
[49:50.920 --> 50:01.480]  You've got the Department of Justice put on wiretap number 56990-34, blocked 602-920-4000.
[50:01.480 --> 50:05.120]  Well, that's our Pyle's phone numbers right there.
[50:05.120 --> 50:12.080]  And then they breach all domains and subdomains of Maricopa County government, the Sheriff's
[50:12.080 --> 50:17.640]  Office, and you've got the IP addresses, 1.5.42.184.18.
[50:17.640 --> 50:21.440]  Now, this information has been available.
[50:21.440 --> 50:26.000]  We were the first to really publish it when you introduced it in federal court.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.760]  And the Department of Justice and the NSA have never come back and said this is not true.
[50:30.760 --> 50:35.720]  And what it shows is that while the Department of Justice, and by the way, this prosecution
[50:35.720 --> 50:39.880]  was brought by Tom Perez, who's a Loraza operative.
[50:39.880 --> 50:45.080]  So we've got Loraza operatives basically tied into this whole situation, NSA databases,
[50:45.080 --> 50:46.080]  you name it.
[50:46.080 --> 50:47.920]  Imagine what Hitler would have done with this type of technology.
[50:47.920 --> 50:48.920]  Stay there, Doc.
[50:48.920 --> 50:50.400]  Doc, we've got to go to break.
[50:50.400 --> 50:51.400]  We'll be right back.
[50:51.400 --> 50:52.400]  I don't think you can hear me.
[50:52.400 --> 50:54.480]  We'll be right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[50:54.480 --> 50:55.480]  Stay with us.
[50:55.480 --> 50:56.480]  I'm Alex Jones.
[50:56.480 --> 50:57.480]  Everybody you know to tune in.
[50:57.480 --> 50:58.480]  They don't want you to hear this.
[50:58.480 --> 50:59.480]  Hi.
[50:59.480 --> 51:00.920]  This is Ron Paul.
[51:00.920 --> 51:04.320]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[51:04.320 --> 51:05.960]  The world is in turmoil.
[51:05.960 --> 51:10.400]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[51:10.400 --> 51:13.400]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[51:13.400 --> 51:17.480]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[51:17.480 --> 51:21.920]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[51:21.920 --> 51:24.760]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[51:24.760 --> 51:28.520]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[51:28.520 --> 51:31.080]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[51:31.080 --> 51:34.640]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[51:34.640 --> 51:39.760]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat, and it lasts up to 25 years.
[51:39.760 --> 51:41.840]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[51:41.840 --> 51:46.200]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.

[54:20.480 --> 54:33.640]  That's right, Obama ordered tapping of her personally, her personal phone, her home,
[54:33.640 --> 54:34.640]  all of it.
[54:34.640 --> 54:36.360]  No one ever taps anybody.
[54:36.360 --> 54:39.560]  This is like living in a lunatic asylum.
[54:39.560 --> 54:44.440]  With this paradox of we're informed, we know what's going on, thousands of articles admitting
[54:44.440 --> 54:48.880]  Trump was being surveilled, the documents he was being surveilled, back to the first
[54:48.880 --> 54:57.160]  year Obama was in office, and they're doing all this, and they're just acting like none
[54:57.160 --> 54:59.520]  of it's happening and saying we're insane.
[54:59.520 --> 55:03.440]  The audience is really informed, okay, so I'm going to ask Dr. Corsi, what do you think
[55:03.440 --> 55:04.440]  we do?
[55:04.440 --> 55:08.960]  I mean, obviously, Drudge is linked to the story, second biggest site in the world, largest
[55:08.960 --> 55:12.920]  news site in the world, okay, when that came out last week, it's the second biggest website
[55:12.920 --> 55:17.560]  in the world after MSM, and he's linked to it, millions have already read it, I looked
[55:17.560 --> 55:21.520]  at this over a million as of this morning, have gone on the story and read it, nowhere
[55:21.520 --> 55:22.520]  in the news.
[55:22.520 --> 55:25.440]  Normally, you know, they analyze everything we say, everything we do, they will not touch
[55:25.440 --> 55:28.400]  it with a 10-foot pole, because they know this has been in federal court, they know
[55:28.400 --> 55:31.880]  the feds have admitted in federal court, these are real, and they said no, okay, because
[55:31.880 --> 55:36.120]  we talked to investigators that were involved, so that we have got them with their pants
[55:36.120 --> 55:41.400]  down around their ankles, hand in the cookie jar, and or it's like walking on a guy on
[55:41.400 --> 55:47.120]  top of your wife butt naked, and I mean, they're just saying this is not what it looks like,
[55:47.120 --> 55:51.080]  this is not what's happening, I'll go further, it's like your wife gets pregnant and has
[55:51.080 --> 55:55.480]  the guy's kid, I mean, and he's saying this isn't my kid, Dr. Corsi, what do you make
[55:55.480 --> 55:56.480]  of this?
[55:56.480 --> 55:57.480]  This is just unbelievable.
[55:57.480 --> 56:03.360]  Well, I think first of all, the mainstream media does not know how to handle this information,
[56:03.360 --> 56:10.640]  we're publishing it, and if it's been out there in federal court, especially today,
[56:10.640 --> 56:18.920]  with this timeline of intervening and judge tampering with DOJ, wiretapping, while the
[56:18.920 --> 56:24.480]  court was going on, Tom Perez was behind this case in the Department of Labor, he's now
[56:24.480 --> 56:30.280]  head of the DNC, he's the guy they just elected to the head of the DNC, he's La Raza, he went
[56:30.280 --> 56:36.240]  after our pile, and while he was there, he and Eric Holder, they spoke to the judges,
[56:36.240 --> 56:42.080]  and they wiretapped the judges, they were wiretapped calling the judges, the NSA came
[56:42.080 --> 56:48.320]  in, we even got the wiretapped number, we've got the verification, I'm Sheriff of our Piles,
[56:48.320 --> 56:53.520]  cell phones and his other office phones, we've got the IP addresses for the Maricopa County
[56:53.520 --> 57:00.760]  Sheriff's Department office, now this was not true, certainly in the last several years,
[57:00.760 --> 57:04.840]  the federal government would have come out and repudiated all this, they haven't, we've
[57:04.840 --> 57:08.720]  begged them, say if this is not true, prove it's wrong, but they've got to prove it's
[57:08.720 --> 57:09.720]  wrong.
[57:09.720 --> 57:11.960]  And by the way, we got permission from our Pio, we're getting some feedback there, we
[57:11.960 --> 57:16.800]  got some permission from our Pio to be able to put this out, this is his home numbers,
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.320]  office numbers, family IP addresses, this is our Pio's stuff, and this is what he was
[57:21.320 --> 57:26.280]  being surveilled in the case, you talk about illegal on so many fronts, this is bombshell,
[57:26.280 --> 57:30.480]  I don't know how they're going to ignore this, and our Pio can certainly sue over all this,
[57:30.480 --> 57:33.640]  they're trying to put him in prison right now for contempt.
[57:33.640 --> 57:37.200]  And I think what we've been doing, I've been making sure the White House has been informed
[57:37.200 --> 57:42.560]  of this every step of the way, the White House has seen Trump's phone numbers that are on
[57:42.560 --> 57:43.560]  the operation.
[57:43.560 --> 57:46.160]  Now let's be clear, before we ever publish, you called, they checked, the president was
[57:46.160 --> 57:50.400]  shown, he's like, yeah, that's my numbers, I mean, I know, I've got, I've got all three
[57:50.400 --> 57:51.400]  of these numbers.
[57:51.400 --> 57:54.720]  And we're going to make sure they see, you know, the article today, I'm going to make
[57:54.720 --> 57:58.400]  sure they see the timelines, make sure they have all in the White House, make sure the
[57:58.400 --> 58:03.440]  top aides, I have seen all this, and then we're talking with Congress, key members of
[58:03.440 --> 58:07.680]  Congress, to make sure this gets in front of congressional investigations.
[58:07.680 --> 58:11.280]  And finally, it's going to get to Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General.
[58:11.280 --> 58:15.400]  So you know, Sheriff, our file is set over and over again, he wants to come and testify
[58:15.400 --> 58:19.720]  in Congress, wants to share this information with the Department of Justice, and all the
[58:19.720 --> 58:23.720]  Department of Justice does, all the FBI does is stonewall.
[58:23.720 --> 58:29.320]  They send Comey up there and Comey says, there's no evidence of President Obama, but the problem
[58:29.320 --> 58:33.040]  is they all brag they were spying on Trump, we got him on TV and in print.
[58:33.040 --> 58:34.360]  And then now they're trying to back off of that.
[58:34.360 --> 58:38.080]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with Dr. Corsi, and we have the detective coming on with all
[58:38.080 --> 58:39.080]  this.
[58:39.080 --> 58:40.080]  This is huge, folks.
[58:40.080 --> 58:42.760]  If you get this out, it is a major blow against the enemy.

[59:52.080 --> 1:00:11.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:13.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:25.080]  Wow, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:32.080]  Well it's high noon central time, Texas time, when that sun is high in that Texas sky, I'll
[1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:40.760]  be bucking at the county fair, and I'll be here on the air.
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:45.640]  It's so real to know that we have memories, we remember them saying they were surveilling
[1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:48.520]  Trump and his people and they had all the evidence, they had the transcripts, and then
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:52.880]  Trump said that's illegal to leak that, and they went, oh, we don't, actually, well we
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:57.160]  have transcripts, but there's no evidence, you're Russian, so let's just not worry about
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:01.360]  that for a minute, and then he goes, yeah, and you're war tapping me, and they go, oh,
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:07.720]  no, no, no, this is such a big deal, and then every news channel is boy, Trump got caught,
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:10.720]  he's an idiot, everybody knows, nobody's getting listed in America.
[1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:15.440]  Look at Conway, she says appliances are listed to you, that's only been in about 5,000 newspapers
[1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:22.760]  over the years, of course we broke it, yes, info wars first broke it 12 years ago, we're
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:27.760]  on record, like they even say, look at the crazy Alex Jones, he was the first one to
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:33.520]  say this, yeah, because Google put out a internal press release with stockholders, they were
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:41.960]  listed to folks in their houses, and creating a database of the text, creating a text document,
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:47.440]  and then shelling, advertising, targeting you specifically off what's going on in your
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:55.720]  house, wow, and so here we are though, Trump's this big idiot, according to them, Dr. Corsi,
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:58.880]  we're gonna hold you over a little bit, this is a short segment, what do you make though
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:02.880]  of this just mass attempt, they're clearly going after him, saying it's impeachable and
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:06.600]  all this other crap, what should the president do, do you agree he should get on the offense,
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:10.320]  sessions is starting to clear out the justice department, it's not political, these are
[1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:13.600]  criminals coming after him, they've committed illegal spying, they've done all these horrible
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:17.920]  things, they're trying to destroy him, I mean the president has gotta go after him.
[1:02:17.920 --> 1:02:23.920]  Gotta go after them, I mean he's got, President Trump has gotta make it clear that he knows
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:28.480]  he's been under surveillance and the proof is in this database, this operation drag
[1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:36.760]  net database, he's gotta go and help Sheriff Arpaio get a hearing with the justice department
[1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:46.300]  before they criminally convict him of contempt in a trial that the DOJ did again, a legal
[1:02:46.300 --> 1:02:47.800]  interfering judge tampering.
[1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:53.080]  Talk about a mistrial by every law out there now, it's gotta be a new trial.
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:57.200]  It's gotta be a new trial, and the people in the Department of Justice, including Tom
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:02.440]  Perez who's head of the DNC, former LaRaza, needs to be brought to justice, he was so
[1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:11.840]  determined to convict Arpaio that they had the NSA, the DOJ, wiretap the judge while
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:17.000]  they were calling the judge and talking to the judge during the trial, working and behind
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:23.640]  the scenes to have all the emails captured at the NSA, the IP addresses, Maricopa County
[1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:31.720]  Sheriff's Office, wiretapping Arpaio's home phone and his cell phone during the trial,
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:35.440]  this is the department, what kind of a Department of Justice in NSA, what kind of a government
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:36.440]  is this?
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:41.040]  And again, another contractor that's involved with the telecoms in NSA brought all this
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:45.000]  to him two years ago, the detectives coming on, this has been even brought up and they
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:49.360]  don't care, they're just moving forward even though they have the evidence, the numbers,
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:51.400]  how they did it all, incredible.
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:58.400]  But their own lying narrative, their own men, their own, well Obama never ordered, well
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:02.800]  of course he didn't order, the law says he couldn't order, any more than Nixon ordered
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:03.800]  wiretapping.
[1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:05.520]  They're playing legalese games.
[1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:09.920]  Yeah, I did not have sex with that woman, that's one of those games.
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:12.760]  Yeah, because Felicio isn't the act of crime.
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:18.000]  Right, sex, so exactly, and that's the distinctions they're trying to draw, and so if you say
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:23.760]  to Comey, well, was Trump ever wiretapped, oh yeah, well yes of course, but you didn't
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:28.760]  ask me that question, that's the kind of nonsense, and that's the complete corruption
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:35.280]  at the heart of the FBI, at the heart of Eric Holder and Lorena Lynch's Department of Justice.
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:38.720]  The total arrogance that she would sit there in an airplane with Bill Clinton during a
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:44.120]  criminal investigation, it just shows the wantonness, so if Trump just does his duty, if Sessions
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:48.200]  just does his duty, then these people are going to be in big trouble.
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:52.400]  Let's talk about how that plays out with Detective Zulo, straight ahead and stay with
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:53.400]  us a little bit more.
[1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:56.680]  Doc, I know you have some more stories to work on, rimfallwars.com, that's our Washington
[1:04:56.680 --> 1:04:59.920]  Bureau chief right there.
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:03.400]  RoboBazos.
[1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:08.000]  The CIA affiliated owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, donned a robo suit straight
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  out of Avatar.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:13.960]  Bezos hopped in the pilot seat of the 13-foot mobile hunk of metal with arms and legs,
[1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:15.560]  mimicking those of a humans.
[1:05:15.560 --> 1:05:20.680]  He smiled for the cameras and said with a smile, bow down before your new king and master.
[1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:25.160]  The robot he was operating is the Method 2, built by the South Korean company, Handcook
[1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:26.160]  Meret.
[1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:30.880]  It operates with two joysticks to control the arms and leg pedals to control the legs.
[1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:35.240]  The robot does still need support in order to stand, essentially still in training wheels,
[1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:38.800]  but the giant metal puppet is certainly turning heads in the tech industry.
[1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:43.440]  While it is all fun and games for now, keep in mind, robot police are now a reality with
[1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:48.280]  more law enforcement, including in the U.S., looking to robot police in the future.
[1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:52.880]  The military has also said it wants to move away from humans and more towards robots.
[1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:55.120]  Is the robo arms race on?
[1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:58.120]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Shroyer.
[1:05:58.120 --> 1:06:03.160]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:04.160]  They lost.

[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:17.840]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it, because I've got caveman, superman of vitality, secret
[1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:20.040]  swell, vitamin, and infusion.
[1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:21.440]  I've got the body armor.
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:22.440]  Wow, thank you.
[1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:24.840]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:26.480]  Which pharmaceutical does you like best?
[1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:30.200]  I really like the vitamin, mineral fusion, to be honest.
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:31.200]  That's amazing.
[1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:32.200]  That's really incredible.
[1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:35.360]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt
[1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:36.360]  the week.
[1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:42.680]  It was fantastic, and I love you guys, I love the InfoWars true, and I just want to, yeah,
[1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:47.720]  I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:48.720]  You will love it.
[1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:50.960]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[1:07:50.960 --> 1:07:55.360]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:07:55.360 --> 1:08:21.760]  So win, win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:23.920]  Welcome back to the second hour.
[1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:26.200]  Starting up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to shift gears and get into the big
[1:08:26.200 --> 1:08:27.200]  news.
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:29.000]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.080]  Global war approaches.
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:36.280]  North Korea warns, if a single bullet is fired, we will take matters in our own hands and
[1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:41.080]  will nuke the United States of America, and they've got nuclear weapons thanks to our
[1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:42.080]  government giving it to them.
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:45.320]  I haven't gotten to this yet, and I don't like to celebrate people's deaths, but I've
[1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:47.840]  got to tell you, he was evil.
[1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:52.440]  Global is David Rockefeller, dead at 101, and I'll give it to him, nobody in the family
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:54.800]  ever made it past 100.
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.600]  Not John D. I, none of them.
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:03.600]  Now, of course, he's getting a really important phone call right now, so he can take his time.
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:07.480]  We'll go back to him in a moment.
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:14.000]  We've got Mike Zula that we're getting lined up via Skype as well, but we're going to be
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.200]  getting into all this news and more.
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:22.280]  Every day I see so many stories I can't keep track of, more than 15 or so is conservative.
[1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:26.560]  Where Muslims are beating people up in Europe for drinking beer at outdoor cafes, or eating
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:29.680]  ham, or eating pizza with sausage on it.
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:36.920]  Here's another one today, Muslim gang attacks Danish couple for eating ham on pizza.
[1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:39.440]  I mean, it's just getting crazier and crazier.
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:43.440]  We also have more clips where Congressman Nunez, the head of the House Intelligence Committee,
[1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:48.960]  says, we've had months to look at these records and everything, the metadata, the surveillance,
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:52.560]  and there's nothing, there's no Russian connection to Trump.
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:54.520]  But how do you have data if he wasn't being surveilled?
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:56.400]  They don't call it wiretapping.
[1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:00.600]  That's an arcane term to go into a copper wire.
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:04.000]  So they've been playing games with all of that.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.680]  This is such a big deal, though, the second part of the series that Dr. Corsi put up today,
[1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:09.680]  published in FullWars.com.
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:14.800]  NSA document, priv surveillance of Donald Trump and his family, bombshell discovery shows,
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:18.120]  targets of NSA project, dragged it.
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:22.400]  Here's a Larry Klayman article, that's the other family judicial watch, at Newsmax.
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:27.280]  Nunez must ask FBI, that's the House Intelligence Committee head again, must ask FBI's company
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:31.080]  about Montgomery mass surveillance case.
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:37.920]  And that's the case given to Arpaio that the feds haven't denied, with the 47 hard drives
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:41.960]  over 60 million pages of information, much bigger than Snowden.
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:47.720]  I mean, this is the Super Snowden.
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:55.520]  The Super Snowden leaks show Obama spied on Trump, Alex Jones, Sheriff Arpaio.
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:56.520]  It's all there.
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:01.440]  House sensational, Drudge, the biggest news site in the world, rated the second biggest
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:06.280]  website in the world, period, has had this link since yesterday at four o'clock.
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:10.520]  Guy search engine, Alex Jones, click Google or search engine, NSA, whatever.
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:16.720]  Because of showtime, I've seen nothing on this, I've never seen that, total blackout.
[1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:17.720]  They don't know how to respond.
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:25.680]  Let me tell you, these phone numbers, these private phone numbers, his private apartment
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:29.800]  at Mar-Lago and all that, these are the numbers.
[1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:31.920]  My old cell phone number nobody had, that's real.
[1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:34.760]  My old private office, that's real.
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:38.680]  All these numbers, real.
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:39.680]  This is real.
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:40.680]  They know that.
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:41.680]  That's why they're so scared.
[1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:44.800]  They're running around saying to the whole world, Trump's insane.
[1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:48.800]  No one ever surveilled you when they were in the news.
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:53.240]  Four times one writer, Matthew Rosenberg, the week of the inauguration saying we have
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:56.560]  the surveillance, we have the transcripts, we have Trump, we have Roger Stone, we have
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:11:59.200]  General Flynn, and all they have General Flynn on the phone with the Russians lining
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:02.920]  up phone call, and the house says, no, that's bull.
[1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:05.400]  We have all the headlines, wiretap data.
[1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:09.280]  We can show it to you all day long.
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:14.600]  Then they go on CNN Thursday and say, I'm crazy or Friday, none of this is real, none
[1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:19.520]  of this is happening, Alex Jones made this up.
[1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:20.520]  Alex Jones made this up.
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:22.120]  They also say I'm a flat earther.
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:24.840]  I've debunked all that crap, but that's what they do, folks.
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:28.920]  They make up things I've never said, straw man, if they say Donald Trump doesn't like
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:33.240]  Hispanics, totally made up.
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:38.400]  Now I want to go to Detective Zula, who is just a great patriot, done so much work on
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:41.880]  the cold case policy and also has worked in New Jersey, but he doesn't want any thanks.
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:45.360]  He wants to stop this, and they're trying to put our pile in prison right now, as you
[1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:46.360]  know.
[1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:48.760]  And that's the second part of this bombshell report.
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:49.760]  It's up on infowords.com.
[1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:53.360]  It needs to go out everywhere.
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:13:01.640]  Obama's NSA illegally spiraled sheriff, or Pio's prosecution, total and complete discovery
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:07.120]  shows targets of NSA's project, dragnet, and now Stone says he has info on something called
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:08.120]  Sidewinder.
[1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:12.360]  So what's going to happen is, folks, Trump's going to strike back, and so are patriots
[1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:13.360]  in the government.
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:14.360]  So just get ready.
[1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:17.760]  They want to play hardball with all this made-up crap, and claim they're surveilling, and Trump
[1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:19.600]  goes, okay, well, it's a leak that you're surveilling.
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:20.600]  Is he legal?
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:21.600]  Oh, no, we never surveilled.
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:22.600]  And then play that game.
[1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:23.600]  It's not going to work.
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:30.960]  So I want to ask Mike Zula what he thinks about all this, working this case for so long,
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:33.080]  and what his gut tells him is going on here.
[1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:37.520]  Because it's like total lies from them, totally crazy.
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:42.320]  This is such amazing news, and it's not like we need MSM to pick this up for it to be big.
[1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.480]  Normally they ridicule and twist everything we say.
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:48.640]  I mean, we're talking 100 articles a day attacking us, zero on this.
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:50.160]  That shows how scared they are.
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:51.360]  They're running scared.
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:52.360]  Mike?
[1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:53.360]  Hi, Alex.
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:54.360]  How are you?
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:55.360]  Good friend.
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:56.360]  Thanks for coming on.
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:57.360]  What an amazing time to be alive.
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:03.800]  Yeah, I guess you could look at it like that.
[1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:08.080]  To put it in a nutshell, to address the question, you just asked, we really don't know what
[1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:09.760]  is going on.
[1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:17.640]  We know that we made every endeavor to bring Mr. Montgomery his information to federal authorities.
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:24.120]  Like I said earlier, we contacted Larry Klayman for his assistance, and under the direction
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:29.200]  of Sheriff Arpaio, we brought Mr. Montgomery to Judge Royce Lamberth, who used to be the
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:30.800]  head of the Pfizer court.
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:35.880]  Judge Lamberth was the Pfizer judge that authorized the bin Laden wiretaps in his living room
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:39.600]  at three o'clock in the morning, and we got him there.
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:44.960]  The dilemma was, for all involved, is where do we go with this?
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:52.680]  Mr. Montgomery, during his tenure as a contractor, the FBI, and this is in court documents, had
[1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:59.320]  illegally executed a search warrant on his home with fabricated affidavits to a judge,
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:03.160]  and that was all bared out in a trial.
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:07.800]  He did not, for obvious reasons, trust the FBI or want to work with the FBI.
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:11.960]  That posed a problem for us, because the only other place we could have gone to at that
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:15.520]  time would have been the Department of Justice, and I believe at that time it was still Eric
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:16.520]  Holder.
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:18.040]  That was a problem.
[1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:20.600]  We didn't know where to take it.
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:27.680]  As this unfolded, Larry Klayman was successful in persuading Mr. Montgomery to talk to the
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:30.040]  FBI, which he did.
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:37.320]  My understanding, you'll have to clarify this with Larry, is Mr. Montgomery brought in a
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:43.040]  sampling of some documentation that the FBI vetted.
[1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:48.280]  In return, they contacted him and gave him what is known as production immunity, and
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:53.120]  he brought in, I believe it was like 600 million records.
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:57.280]  He provided them that information, some time goes by, and they called him back and they
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:15:59.520]  gave him testimonial immunity.
[1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:05.240]  That's right, it's reported 47 hard drives, 60 million pages of information.
[1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:06.800]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:10.160]  This is way better than anything WikiLeaks or Snowden never had, and now we're checking
[1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:11.160]  the data.
[1:16:11.160 --> 1:16:12.160]  It's all real.
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:13.160]  There's no way this guy had this.
[1:16:13.160 --> 1:16:14.160]  These are real databases.
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:18.000]  Well, and you know, that's the perplexing part of all of this.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:23.880]  This was exposed in a civil proceeding as a side issue.
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:26.840]  It was put out there in the public.
[1:16:26.840 --> 1:16:30.920]  Information that was gathered was turned over to plaintiffs' attorneys.
[1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:33.080]  It was turned over in open court.
[1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:34.080]  It was put on big law.
[1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:36.440]  I was just corrected, as I apologize, detective.
[1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:40.160]  It was 600 million, excuse me, 600 million.
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:41.160]  I misspoke.
[1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:42.160]  Go ahead.
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:44.640]  Yeah, it was put out there for the world to see.
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:50.480]  The documentation you have now is actually leaked by ACLU attorneys to the press out
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:57.560]  here in Phoenix, one particular left-hard-leaning publication, that I had recorded conversations
[1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:02.280]  with Mr. Montgomery in our very first meetings with him because we didn't know him.
[1:17:02.280 --> 1:17:04.720]  We didn't know if he was even real.
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:10.440]  They leaked that information, and when the ACLU attorney stood up in federal court and
[1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:13.680]  said she did it, there was not even an admonishment.
[1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:15.800]  Nobody seemed to care.
[1:17:15.800 --> 1:17:18.660]  This information was turned over at that point in time.
[1:17:18.660 --> 1:17:23.400]  My understanding is Mr. Montgomery brought information that he did not share with us,
[1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:26.440]  and I want your audience to understand what we were trying to accomplish.
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:28.960]  We were not looking for classified information.
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:34.800]  What we were trying to do was validate some of the claims of Montgomery through the civilian
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:35.800]  side of this.
[1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:38.840]  In other words, you claim you have this civilian information.
[1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:40.080]  Let us vet it.
[1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:41.080]  Let us find out.
[1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:45.320]  Do you spot check different info randomly that he obviously can't just go and guess
[1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:48.200]  what you're going to spot check and what you find?
[1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:53.920]  The personal information on a lot of the 151,000 people was absolutely correct, although none
[1:17:53.920 --> 1:17:58.920]  of them can identify the bank accounts that were alleged to be theirs.
[1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:04.560]  That gets to be very interesting because those bank accounts, it is suspected that they are
[1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:07.360]  actually fraudulent transactions.
[1:18:07.360 --> 1:18:12.640]  One of those bank accounts had accounts in it with high-specutive real estate, gas and
[1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:14.640]  oil, stock plays.
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:18.280]  We're talking about a lot of derivatives, speculative things being done in other people's
[1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:19.280]  names.
[1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:20.280]  Correct.
[1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:21.280]  Correct.
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:22.560]  That's all been turned over.
[1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:25.320]  Everything involving this case has been turned over.
[1:18:25.320 --> 1:18:30.680]  For two years now, since Mr. Claimant brought him to the federal authorities, the FBI, we
[1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:31.680]  have heard nothing.
[1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:37.040]  Nobody has said that this information is garbage, and nobody has said it's creditable.
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:43.040]  So we don't know, as within our jurisdictional powers, we don't have the jurisdiction to
[1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:44.040]  further this.
[1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:48.400]  This had to be done on a federal level, and that's where it stands today.
[1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:52.760]  What's bringing this to the forefront now is the fact that a lot of stuff that Mr. Montgomery
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:57.440]  told us, and you have to understand, there are conversations that take place.
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:02.320]  Mr. Montgomery had alerted us to things, and I gave you one highlight yesterday of the
[1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:07.480]  attorney-client privilege, Breach, that Mr. Snowden did not release for about three or
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:13.360]  four months after Mr. Montgomery alerted us to this, that start to manifest in the news.
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:17.160]  And now today, we're seeing a lot of information come out in the news.
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:19.080]  Things that Montgomery told us were going on.
[1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:20.080]  Sure.
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:21.080]  Sure.
[1:19:21.080 --> 1:19:24.080]  Why did Montgomery come to you?
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:25.640]  He tried to become a whistleblower.
[1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:29.720]  I believe, I could be wrong on the count, it was about a dozen times.
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:35.480]  He brought all the correspondence that he tried to go forward with this, and he was
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:37.800]  shut down at every turn.
[1:19:37.800 --> 1:19:38.800]  And Mr. Montgomery...
[1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:39.800]  Sure.
[1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:42.280]  I mean, it sounds like this was when Snowden had first been coming out a few years ago,
[1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:46.120]  so probably all that probably added to him wanting to then get it out.
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:47.240]  I'm sure it did.
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:48.760]  I'm sure it did.
[1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:52.400]  You know, Dennis tried to bring the information forward.
[1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:53.920]  He could not.
[1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:59.680]  When Sheriff Arpaio saw the 151,000 names, he became alarmed, because those are 151,000
[1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:03.960]  citizens, let alone his own information is in there, but that wasn't really what was
[1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:04.960]  motivating him.
[1:20:04.960 --> 1:20:10.560]  There are 151,000 citizens, and this is an identity theft case at the very least.
[1:20:10.560 --> 1:20:11.840]  So it needed to be investigated.
[1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:15.920]  But then you look at the names, the numbers are matching up, and it's surveillance files,
[1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:20.120]  and then you look, Dragnet's an admitted program that was going on that did just this, and
[1:20:20.120 --> 1:20:24.080]  it's in London Guardian, it's in AP, it's in the EFF Foundation.
[1:20:24.080 --> 1:20:25.320]  I mean, this is super creepy.
[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:30.280]  And again, I talked to Roger, because I know three of Trump's numbers, and then I was a
[1:20:30.280 --> 1:20:33.160]  while back actually got Trump's apartment number, but he's like, yeah, call him.
[1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:34.160]  I never had the nerve to do it.
[1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:36.160]  I just left it alone when he's in Marlago.
[1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:38.560]  But that's the number in there too, two Trump's apartment.
[1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:41.480]  I mean, let me tell you, your guy didn't have Trump's apartment number.
[1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:43.200]  I mean, this is real.
[1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:49.160]  No, Alex, you know, the information is so voluminous, and a lot of that information does
[1:20:49.160 --> 1:20:53.040]  bear out to be correct, that you really have to start to wonder, how did any one human
[1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:58.840]  being get this unless they were doing something with use of very high-powered, sophisticated
[1:20:58.840 --> 1:20:59.840]  computer apparatus?
[1:20:59.840 --> 1:21:02.840]  But what did he tell you he was doing, or did he not want to incriminate himself?
[1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:06.280]  Well, I don't want to go into too much of what he said.
[1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:09.200]  He said it was similar, though, a contractor like Snowden.
[1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:15.800]  Actually, Mr. Montgomery, and this is public, Mr. Montgomery was a contractor who developed
[1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:23.160]  the hacking software that could penetrate firewalls of computers, breach them, take over as the
[1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:28.360]  administrator, and remain undetected for about an hour and a half, and download whatever
[1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:30.360]  they want.
[1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:31.960]  And that's my understanding.
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:37.600]  Well, I mean, tell you, these records, and it's from federal databases, and matches
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:39.400]  up with the people we know that have seen this stuff.
[1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:43.360]  This is a program, and however he got it, this is going on, and the fact that Trump's
[1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:46.440]  in here, I mean, we've got him right there.
[1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:53.400]  And, but Alex, you know, the troubling part is this was bore out in a federal proceeding.
[1:21:53.400 --> 1:21:54.400]  This is...
[1:21:54.400 --> 1:21:55.400]  That's crazy.
[1:21:55.400 --> 1:21:56.400]  Like, it's no big deal.
[1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:57.400]  Talk about that.
[1:21:57.400 --> 1:21:58.600]  No, it's like it's no big deal.
[1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:03.760]  It's like the motive here was to simply discredit the whole investigation and discredit Montgomery.
[1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:04.920]  That seems to be the motive.
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:09.440]  And look, Montgomery, for whatever people want to say about him, this is how I described
[1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:12.080]  it to Dr. Corsi earlier today.
[1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:14.960]  You could be the biggest financial con man in the world.
[1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:16.840]  Everything about you could be a lie.
[1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:18.320]  Everything you say could be a lie.
[1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:21.680]  But at the end of the day, you know what, you still have a real check in your pocket
[1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:24.480]  because you've got it from someplace.
[1:22:24.480 --> 1:22:25.480]  So the...
[1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:27.680]  You judge it three by its fruits.
[1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:28.680]  Yes.
[1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:34.000]  So, instead of focusing so much on Montgomery and his character or lack thereof, which the
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:38.520]  government had planned its stories, which is very clear to see that they did, to discredit
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:39.520]  him.
[1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:45.080]  Listen, they had, last week, they had Alec Baldwin get up and say, Alec Jones doesn't
[1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:47.200]  like black people on Saturday Night Live to discredit me.
[1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:48.200]  I never said that.
[1:22:48.200 --> 1:22:51.440]  That's the level they go through to discredit people they're scared of.
[1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:56.520]  Well, and the fact is, is this information would validate Montgomery's claims.
[1:22:56.520 --> 1:23:00.520]  Everything about Montgomery, everything else about Mr. Montgomery, isn't a periphery as
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:03.960]  far as I'm concerned because you can take the information.
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:11.160]  If the information is valid, 80, 90, 100%, 20%, 30%, then the question becomes, how could
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:12.160]  you acquire this?
[1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:14.960]  Well, and let's go there in a moment, and of course he's right to shock, and one of
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:16.960]  us, he can pop him whenever he wants.
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:21.600]  Again, Mike Zulo, the hero, a detective of the Cold Case Posse, the head of that, that
[1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:25.240]  just tirelessly donated his years of work to this country.
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:26.240]  It's amazing.
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:30.440]  I mean, because other folks need to make these sacrifices without Mike, we'd be in even greater
[1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:31.640]  trouble.
[1:23:31.640 --> 1:23:36.840]  But again, we have to ask, now that we have this info, what do we do with it?
[1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:37.840]  Exactly.
[1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:42.240]  They always change the subject about WikiLeaks onto Julian Assange or onto somebody else instead
[1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:43.240]  of, it doesn't matter.
[1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:46.200]  They admit this is real, this criminal activity, fine.
[1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:50.360]  Just like William Benny, the former head of the NSA said here on air, okay, fine, charge
[1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:53.960]  Snowden with something, but let's charge people a thousand times worse with all the
[1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:56.520]  massive crimes going on here that have been proven.
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:23:58.840]  They distract off on, okay, who's this guy?
[1:23:58.840 --> 1:23:59.840]  Oh, they planted a story.
[1:23:59.840 --> 1:24:00.840]  It doesn't matter.
[1:24:00.840 --> 1:24:05.400]  If it's real, or almost all of us real, what are you going to do, because these databases
[1:24:05.400 --> 1:24:08.200]  get corrupted, obviously, what are you going to do with this?
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:10.800]  What are you going to do with this information?
[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:11.800]  Stop changing the subject.
[1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:13.600]  I think that's what you're getting at, Mike.
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:14.600]  That is what I'm getting at.
[1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:18.600]  And I want to make a big distinction between Montgomery and Snowden.
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:20.760]  Montgomery didn't flee the country.
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:26.000]  Montgomery has been petitioning to sit and tell somebody what has gone on.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  He has been trying.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.080]  Which is what you're supposed to do under law.
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:32.760]  Well, you know, Alex, it's like I don't even understand my country anymore.
[1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:35.200]  None of this makes any sense.
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:41.760]  It's pretty bad when a law enforcement officer, the caliber of Sheriff Arpaio, a former federal
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:48.440]  agent, a sitting judge are in a dilemma as to where do we go?
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:50.560]  Because this has gone silent.
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:53.760]  And you know, silence usually tells you a lot.
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:57.640]  You interview someone who's suspect and you don't get a direct answer or a lot of big
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:24:59.240]  pause, a lot of silence.
[1:24:59.240 --> 1:25:03.280]  Well, you kind of know the answer you're going to get next is going to be a lie.
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:06.680]  So you look at this and you say, wow, everybody wants to be quiet about this.
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:09.080]  Everybody who just wants to sweep this guy under the rug.
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:11.480]  And look, I am not an advocate for Dennis Montgomery.
[1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:15.000]  I know the amount of time and effort Detective McEwits and I put into this.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.320]  I know the time and effort the Sheriff has put into this.
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:19.920]  I know the time and effort Larry Claimant has put into this.
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:23.800]  And all we're asking is please look at this and let us know, is this true?
[1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:29.360]  Because if this is true, our problems are far greater than anybody and let's not forget
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:32.840]  Larry Claimant is the guy that got the big ruling against the NSA that stopped it for
[1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:34.120]  three years.
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:37.680]  Another incredible hero and all he gets is demonized and then we should nobody wants
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:38.680]  credit.
[1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:41.800]  That's the funny thing about claiming or you or anybody, but I was asking you how people
[1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:42.800]  help you like nothing.
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:43.800]  I'm just donating my time.
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:44.800]  I was doing it.
[1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:48.440]  It's just crazy to know that people like you and claiming and others out there, I want
[1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:50.560]  the audience to understand.
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:53.640]  I don't want to get into this because it just gives the enemy, you know, what they want.
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:55.880]  But let me tell you, there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:57.680]  They are royal pissed.
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:00.080]  All hell's been raking loose around here since last week.
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:02.880]  I'm too busy just doing the show and working every day to pay attention.
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:03.880]  I see the store.
[1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:04.880]  Our reports are coming out.
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:05.880]  No, they're coming.
[1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:06.960]  We just, we just put them out and we know they're true.
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:09.640]  But believe me, folks, we could not be here next week.
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:11.640]  That's how dangerous this is.
[1:26:11.640 --> 1:26:12.640]  Stone could be dead.
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:13.640]  They're trying to kill him right now.
[1:26:13.640 --> 1:26:14.640]  They don't want him testifying.
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:16.640]  They want to make him the bad guy and then kill him.
[1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:21.520]  And I don't want to just get into it all because it's just, it's over the top, okay?
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:23.160]  It's like a spy movie.
[1:26:23.160 --> 1:26:25.280]  People want Americans to stand up and fight.
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:26.280]  We're here doing it.
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:27.280]  Okay?
[1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:28.280]  And I'm not doing it because I'm some hero.
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:31.320]  I'm not going to be a slave of these globalist criminals.
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:32.520]  My instinct is to fight them.
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:33.840]  Just know this.
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:36.440]  Trump is up against stuff far worse than the election now.
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:38.120]  You want men to fight and women to fight?
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:39.320]  We're doing it.
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:43.520]  And what we need you to do is to pray for us and to get these articles and then information
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:47.480]  out to local talk show hosts, local papers, anybody that's honest to look at this and
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:48.680]  to do something about it.
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:50.960]  Because if they can get away with this, the sky's the limit.
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:52.880]  I mean, listen, they're so arrogant, folks.
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:57.240]  They had the CIA director two days before Trump fired him, tell him on TV, the president
[1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:00.640]  elect needs to watch his mouth like a gangster.
[1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:03.960]  Mike, and I've got Corsi here too, of course he's polite, but if he's got other points,
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:07.000]  but Mike, other points that are important.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:11.920]  Well I think, Alex, the other thing that is really, really scary in this whole thing is
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:17.360]  it appears to me that our federal government, what we recognize as our federal government-
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:18.360]  Is rogue.
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:21.360]  Is powerless to stop this.
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:24.640]  Yeah, Trump's in there and Sessions is in there and they're all in mutiny against him,
[1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:25.640]  do whatever they want.
[1:27:25.640 --> 1:27:31.760]  Well, and there are good people in the CIA, the NSA and the FBI, and we don't have whistleblower
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:35.040]  protection laws that truly protect these people.
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:39.440]  We don't have any way to have people come forward when this kind of activity is going
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:44.680]  on because they're going to be publicly destroyed, they're going to be destroyed for their life,
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:46.280]  and these people can't come forward.
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:52.080]  So look, we have Patriots in the NSA, CIA, my hat is off to those guys, they do stuff-
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:55.160]  Sure, the media always acts like we're saying they're all criminals when we bash, the high
[1:27:55.160 --> 1:27:56.160]  level-
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:27:57.160]  We're not.
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:01.120]  They call it controller level crime, it's the top people.
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:05.000]  That's what it appears to be, and there are rogue entities within there that are doing
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  this.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  Go ahead, Jerry, do you want to say something?
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  I think-
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:12.600]  Yeah, I want to say, look, I've worked with Mike now for, since 2011, we've worked together.
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:14.160]  We have too.
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:19.920]  And I want to say that Mike, as honest as they come, he did not want, he does not want to
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:20.920]  be doing this.
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:26.920]  I mean, we've been working on this for days, and actually a couple of weeks, and Mike,
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:31.800]  it's like pulling teeth, he has other things to do, he's not even in the sheriff's office
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:37.040]  anymore, he has a life to lead, and a family to take care of, he doesn't need to be doing
[1:28:37.040 --> 1:28:38.040]  this.
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:40.400]  And it takes great courage for him to do it.
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:45.720]  And I'm telling you, Mike speaks the truth, it's carefully put together, he's not going
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:47.120]  to tell you something is so-
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:50.760]  Sure, the audience knows that, Dr. Corsi, so what do we do?
[1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:51.760]  What do we do with this?
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:56.200]  This is bombshell, just on our pile, it's over the top, with trumpets over the top.
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:29:00.080]  What I want to do, where I'm, you know, we've got to understand the sheriff, our pile has
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:06.680]  the potential here to go to prison, to go to jail for six months on a trumped up charge
[1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:07.680]  where the-
[1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:09.760]  And if they can get him, they can get us all.
[1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:13.640]  And we've got to come to his defense, we've got to demand that Attorney General Sessions
[1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:19.240]  look at the malfeasance, the misbehavior, the criminal activity of Eric Holder and
[1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:27.400]  Loretta Lynch and Tom Perez, in rigging a prosecution, judge tampering, illegal, electronic
[1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:28.400]  surveillance.
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:30.400]  Well, let's talk about what we do with that, and the Trump thing, if you can both do five
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:33.040]  minutes of peace, when we come back, we'll let Mike get out of here, we'll give Mike
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:35.920]  with five minutes of final statement on this other break, and Dr. Corsi, I'm going to shift
[1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:40.040]  gears in North Korea, running to New Japan and South Korea, I mean, it's just, it's
[1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:44.120]  unprecedented, and they're actually been loading the missiles, and World War III could break
[1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:48.960]  out in a minute too, this is a crazy time to be alive folks.
[1:29:48.960 --> 1:30:03.440]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:08.040]  The CIA affiliated owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, donned a robo suit straight
[1:30:08.040 --> 1:30:09.040]  out of Avatar.
[1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:14.240]  Bezos hopped in the pilot seat of the 13-foot mobile hunk of metal with arms and legs, mimicking
[1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:18.960]  those of a humans, he smiled for the cameras and said with a smile, bow down before your
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:20.680]  new king and master.
[1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:25.160]  The robot he was operating is the Method 2, built by the South Korean company, Handcook
[1:30:25.160 --> 1:30:26.160]  Meret.
[1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:30.880]  It operates with two joysticks to control the arms, and leg pedals to control the legs.
[1:30:30.880 --> 1:30:35.240]  The robot does still need support in order to stand, essentially still in training wheels,
[1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:38.800]  but the giant metal puppet is certainly turning heads in the tech industry.
[1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:43.480]  While it is all fun and games for now, keep in mind robot police are now a reality, with
[1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:48.320]  more law enforcement, including in the US, looking to robot police in the future.
[1:30:48.320 --> 1:30:52.920]  The military has also said it wants to move away from humans and more towards robots.
[1:30:52.920 --> 1:31:03.760]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:06.640]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:12.680]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:31:12.680 --> 1:31:17.640]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[1:31:17.640 --> 1:31:22.600]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[1:31:22.600 --> 1:31:23.600]  or office.
[1:31:23.600 --> 1:31:27.800]  You owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you
[1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:29.400]  can to purify your air.
[1:31:29.400 --> 1:31:34.400]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:37.400]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:31:37.400 --> 1:31:39.600]  The general public doesn't.
[1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:43.560]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:47.160]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:31:47.160 --> 1:31:50.720]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:53.960]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:31:53.960 --> 1:32:23.360]  Check it out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:27.680]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:32.360]  weight polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:36.400]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line
[1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:38.360]  of advanced lightweight armor.
[1:32:38.360 --> 1:32:39.360]  It works.
[1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:42.960]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:47.880]  ballistic resistant certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[1:32:47.880 --> 1:32:52.640]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsStore.com so you can defend yourself,
[1:32:52.640 --> 1:32:57.680]  your family, and finance the InfoWars against the globalists all at the same time, a total
[1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:10.520]  360 win.
[1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:23.240]  Why from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:30.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, as scary as all this is, I'm not up here doing this as scary as
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:33.360]  I always knew when the media would say, oh look at Jones, he's fair mongered, or people
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:34.360]  would also accuse me on the internet.
[1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:38.360]  I was trying to scare folks not to be politically involved, telling them how dangerous all this
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:39.360]  is.
[1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:42.080]  Those people don't count, they're going to be scared of their own shadow, God bless
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:43.080]  them.
[1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:46.320]  I'm looking for people that want to hear about the real stuff that's going on to then
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:47.320]  organize against it.
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:51.720]  We've done that all over the world, nationalism's coming back, the family's coming back, Christianity
[1:33:51.720 --> 1:33:57.560]  starting to come back, good things are happening, but the politicos and the corrupt elites
[1:33:57.560 --> 1:34:04.160]  that want monopolies, they are coming down with both feet against nationalismists everywhere.
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:07.400]  Now I can see globalism if nations work together and it was some type of agreement.
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:09.400]  This is like worldwide tyranny.
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:14.120]  We've got big developments on that front coming up with the new head of the globalist.
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:19.720]  That's definitely Bill Gates, David Rockefeller died of course yesterday, we're going to talk
[1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:20.720]  about that.
[1:34:20.720 --> 1:34:26.240]  But the new head kingpin is Bill Gates, I've made a study of it and he's the head guy
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:27.240]  right now.
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:31.720]  In fact, I mean there's some big rich families that meet with him admittedly in secret meetings
[1:34:31.720 --> 1:34:36.600]  in New York and London, that's come out even in Associated Press, AP.
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:41.040]  We reported it in in-game before it was in the news, we had our sources, but it's beyond
[1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:42.040]  Bilderberg.
[1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:45.160]  And I've talked to folks that are in those meetings at Bilderberg, their own assistants,
[1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:47.440]  you wonder why would their own assistants come out against them when it's so dangerous,
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:50.160]  because sometimes they kill them.
[1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:53.920]  When you hear the type of crap, they're talking about these meetings, I mean if Bill Gates
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:58.560]  says he wants to get rid of 80% of the world population on PBS, what do you think he says
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:05.600]  in a secret meeting with 150 other world leaders?
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:10.960]  And their brainwashing is so bad that some of the public are like, well there are too
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:15.600]  many of us, well then you kill yourself first, don't cut food off the Africans or put crap
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:16.600]  in the vaccines.
[1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:20.640]  So that's all coming up here in just a few minutes, Mike, I want you to have a chance
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:26.240]  and also Dr. Corsi, you know to have a chance, but Mike Zulo, again the former head of the
[1:35:26.240 --> 1:35:32.160]  cold case, Posse, for Sheriff Arpaio that Soros, again the usual suspects, Soros is
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:36.560]  the number two guy, put all their money, what was it, 30-something million against and all
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:43.560]  these attacks from other sheriffs, like Clark up in Milwaukee, I mean it is just incredible
[1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:48.240]  these foreign influences, these multinationals, what they're doing and just recapping how
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:52.640]  this ties together with your whistleblower on Arpaio being surveilled, all the records
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:59.840]  that all matches up on what's happening with Trump and the fact that yes the NSA was spying
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:04.720]  on him, show bombshell, what else should we impart to the viewers and listeners?
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:09.840]  Well on Sheriff Arpaio's account if the timeline, and I'm going by memory so I'm not going to
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:15.680]  give you dates, but my understanding is this alleged wiretapping, and you have to understand
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:20.200]  I have to say alleged because we can't verify it, but the alleged wiretapping-
[1:36:20.200 --> 1:36:24.560]  Just like you see a duck swimming around a pond, but you haven't gotten it for DNA testing,
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:27.920]  you can't say that's a duck, you know there's a, it looks like a mallard has a green head,
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:32.600]  it's got orange feet, it's eating moss off the bottom and swimming around, but we think
[1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:33.600]  it's a duck.
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:40.360]  Correct, and this is when they were pursuing Sheriff Arpaio under a criminal charge.
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:48.160]  That criminal case was dropped and at the same time the individuals that were propelling
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:54.520]  that case moved over to a private law firm and then out of the clear blue a civil proceeding
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:56.000]  ensued.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:02.280]  Now my understanding is during that criminal case Sheriff Arpaio's attorneys requested
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:08.200]  from the DOJ their discovery and they were told point blank you are the discovery you're
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:14.600]  not getting anything, but then they dropped the case and you have to ask yourself why.
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:18.960]  Was it possibly because they were up on the phones and they couldn't disclose they were
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:19.960]  up on the phones?
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:27.480]  Nobody knows and the civil thing is really nothing more than a doorway under the old
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:32.560]  administration to gain entrance into Sheriff's offices, law enforcement offices and federally
[1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:33.560]  control them.
[1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:34.560]  That was the goal.
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:38.480]  And now you have just sessions is coming out saying we're not going to do that anymore.
[1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:45.200]  You have Donald Trump trying to re-institute the same activities conducted by regular
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:50.320]  law enforcement given authority by the federal government to conduct that were taken away
[1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:51.320]  by the Obama.
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:57.040]  Let's be clear Mike Zulow cold case posse head detective was active till this year.
[1:37:57.040 --> 1:37:58.560]  This is so bombshell.
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:04.160]  It's admitted that the feds some good some bad are using spying on local police.
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:06.800]  So criminal networks and the feds can run their operations.
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:09.080]  They can also corrupt police take control.
[1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:10.800]  It destroys the separation of powers.
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:14.520]  Trump is announcing his attorney general is announcing we're ending that in fact we're
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:17.600]  going to share lawfully obtained information to go out for criminals.
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:18.600]  That's why they're so pissed.
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:23.320]  It's why the entire surveillance federal grid is now lining up against Trump because he's
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:27.320]  taking their their ill gotten unconstitutional power away.
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:31.120]  Like you said, we're going to transfer the power back to the people and back to the states
[1:38:31.120 --> 1:38:32.440]  in that inaugural address.
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:33.440]  He's doing it.
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:37.160]  So they're running around like a bunch of Linda Blair's out of control.
[1:38:37.160 --> 1:38:40.280]  Well, and Alex, this goes to morality.
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:44.360]  The biggest problem here is, look, this technology is wonderful and could have very great
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:49.360]  assets to law enforcement if it is used in a moral and just fashion.
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:54.320]  And it's not and the unsuspecting public just want to believe that their law enforcement
[1:38:54.320 --> 1:38:58.120]  agencies, especially the federal agencies, are of that moral standard.
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:00.440]  Well, that's not happening anymore.
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:05.400]  That's what makes this so, so dangerous for the average citizen.
[1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:10.320]  Imagine giving Obama and all these corrupt haters the power of almost God for omnipresent
[1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:11.320]  surveillance.
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:12.320]  They've had it.
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:15.120]  Trump's a liar when he talks about it.
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:20.720]  Well, parallel construction would afford them an opportunity to literally gin up a charge
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:22.720]  against you.
[1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:24.520]  And I want your listeners to understand something else.
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:27.280]  I was reading this nuts who know too long ago.
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:32.120]  My understanding now is there is computer software that takes voice in Prince of your
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:39.320]  voice and you could literally have an undetected altered conversation take place that you weren't
[1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:40.320]  even party.
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:45.160]  Absolutely, they've had software for a decade that could do perfect video and audio.
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:49.480]  Now it's publicly available to public and can break voice prints now.
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:52.520]  So that's why they're having to start getting rid of voice prompts because it can break
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:53.520]  those.
[1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:54.520]  Oh, it's absolutely.
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:55.520]  Exactly.
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:56.520]  Think of this power.
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:39:58.520]  And it's in the new vault seven leaks.
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:39:59.520]  What is it?
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:00.520]  7000 pages.
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:05.560]  They admit that CIA real documents that they were planting stuff on the Russians to blame
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:07.600]  them doing hacks with their software.
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:09.800]  Well, they're doing it the citizens as well.
[1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:10.800]  Yeah.
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:14.680]  And so, I mean, it is very alarming, very concerning and nobody is safe.
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:18.440]  Look, I personally, I don't really care.
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:19.440]  You know what I mean?
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:20.600]  You knocked yourself out.
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:22.360]  But that's not the point.
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:24.240]  The point is, is what can be done with this?
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:26.200]  What can be done to destroy you?
[1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:27.200]  What can be done to blackmail?
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:31.440]  Well, this happened to me two weeks ago, Stephen Colbert played a clip and you can watch it
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:32.440]  in the clip.
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:37.680]  If they just edited one word out and blipped it on the internet, I said, I don't hate
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:42.480]  gays and it says, I hate gays.
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:44.400]  I mean, that's they're already doing it.
[1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:45.400]  That's what I mean.
[1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:50.000]  It's like, what do you call the criminal lawless arrogance when it finally builds like a serial
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.680]  killer will kill their first five, six, seven people and be real careful?
[1:40:52.680 --> 1:40:55.040]  Then they start getting reckless and they really want to get reckless.
[1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:57.520]  Then they start sitting in letters in the cops.
[1:40:57.520 --> 1:41:00.760]  It's like they're thumbing their noses at us in the criminology.
[1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:01.760]  You're an expert on that.
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:02.760]  What do you say about that?
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:06.640]  It's because it's because they believe they are above it all.
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:12.000]  And now they take our statutes and they hide behind our statutes to protect the program,
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:13.720]  protect the information.
[1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:15.960]  There's no oversight.
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:17.120]  That's the issue.
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:21.280]  There are special programs I've come to learn, special access programs that are even out
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:22.720]  of the purview of Congress.
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:26.920]  Well, who is issuing the oversight?
[1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:31.440]  Who's running these programs and then how do you know what they're doing with these programs?
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:35.640]  It's Pandora's box.
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:37.920]  Orwellian isn't even the word anymore.
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:43.360]  I don't even know what you call this, but in the wrong hands, it is a weapon that's
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:47.640]  worse than a nuclear warhead because in a nuclear warhead, you're dead.
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:50.840]  You're going to have to live with whatever these people do to you.
[1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:52.560]  So this is a problem.
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:59.880]  It's huge and it's something that our, quote, government, our elected officials really need
[1:41:59.880 --> 1:42:04.200]  to reign in and control to some extent.
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:09.600]  And then they're spying on Judge Arpaio during his court case or spying on Trump, going back
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:12.280]  to the first year of Obama and beyond.
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:13.600]  It is just insane.
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:16.320]  Well, Mike, thank you so much for all you've done.
[1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:19.800]  If any other whistleblowers or folks want to contact you, I know you probably don't want
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:20.800]  more work to do.
[1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:21.800]  Do this on your own.
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:22.800]  But I've met you.
[1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:23.800]  You've been here.
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:24.800]  You're a great guy.
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:28.000]  And I got to tell you, listen, as bad as it gets, I think we're starting to turn the corner.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.480]  So, you know, I'm only people of pep talk.
[1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:34.320]  And by the way, I won't do a pep talk if there isn't reasons to have a pep talk.
[1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:38.280]  I see a lot of positive things happening and, you know, we're pulling teeth here.
[1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:42.520]  We're digging out a bunch of entitled, out of control social engineers, a bunch of leftists
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:46.440]  who run this and they're just out to play God and no wonder they're so arrogant.
[1:42:46.440 --> 1:42:48.160]  But, you know, they're not so arrogant now.
[1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:50.160]  They're starting to get the fear of God in them, Mike.
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:52.960]  Well, Alex, thank you for everything that you do.
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:58.320]  You drudge WND others out there because we don't have a voice.
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:02.160]  The blackout that you talked about, it is exactly what they are doing.
[1:43:02.160 --> 1:43:04.680]  If they don't report it, it never happens.
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:05.680]  So thank you.
[1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:06.680]  Thank you.
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:07.680]  Thank you.
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:08.680]  Please run this together.
[1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:09.680]  We're all got families.
[1:43:09.680 --> 1:43:10.680]  Run this together.
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:11.680]  God bless you.
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:12.680]  Thank you, Mike.
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:13.680]  You too, brother.
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:14.680]  Doc, of course.
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:15.680]  I know you've got to get and write some more articles.
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:16.680]  Great job.
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:17.680]  I know you're getting amazing info from the White House too on Fannie Mae and Freddie
[1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:18.680]  Mac and Obama's deal.
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:19.680]  And now it's 260 something million we've learned.
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:25.180]  I mean, your articles are all so powerful and either from high level leaks or the White
[1:43:25.180 --> 1:43:29.360]  House, you're pointing out what needs to be looked at, notice everything you write for
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:31.680]  us, everything else we write is picked up in the news.
[1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:36.160]  Everything you write, you get total blacklist, which shows you are really on target, my friends.
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:40.080]  I want to thank you and thank drudge and everybody else because we are in this together.
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:41.080]  But thank God for drudge.
[1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:43.000]  I don't know how they're going to ignore.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  Let's put drudgereport.com up.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  I think it's still the middle column.
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:47.800]  It's been up since four o'clock yesterday or five o'clock.
[1:43:47.800 --> 1:43:53.400]  How in the hell could they ignore the top link on drudge for almost a day?
[1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:57.040]  I mean, they cover everything he links to, they are must be crapping their breaches right
[1:43:57.040 --> 1:43:58.040]  now.
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:03.440]  Well, I think, you know, honestly, the key point is another point that Mike Sula said,
[1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:06.800]  and that is Mike has been out with this information.
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:13.360]  He's been begging for it to be proven wrong, bringing it to the feds.
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:14.360]  They ignore it.
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:16.000]  So finally it's on drudge.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:20.320]  And what we've got to do, what we're doing, millions of Americans are paying attention
[1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:22.720]  because they're not listening anymore to the mainstream media.
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:27.840]  They're not listening to, you know, Comey, who looks about as phony as you can get, saying,
[1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:35.200]  you know, there's no evidence that Obama wiretap, it ordered the wiretap, it's always very carefully
[1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:36.200]  worded.
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:38.800]  And in fact, they're just presenting a Watergate defense.
[1:44:38.800 --> 1:44:43.440]  They know, and this our pile information was presented in federal court.
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:45.600]  I think it's 100% authentic.
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:47.440]  It's never been repudiated by the federal government.
[1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:50.960]  And what it shows is that, you know, the federal government.
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:53.480]  And we knew a project dragnet was admitted and going on.
[1:44:53.480 --> 1:44:54.480]  That's in the news.
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:55.480]  This is dragnet database.
[1:44:55.480 --> 1:44:57.980]  It's 100% authentic.
[1:44:57.980 --> 1:44:58.980]  And I think still continuing.
[1:44:58.980 --> 1:45:00.480]  I don't think they ever quit.
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:05.440]  And six hundred million pages of it.
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:10.560]  And obviously I can't show this as people's home addresses and bank card numbers and not
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:11.840]  releasing the database.
[1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:15.800]  We're going to, what we're going to say is we'll be happy to release the database, Department
[1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:19.120]  of Justice, or the White House, or a Congress, the official.
[1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:22.960]  The National Press Club with the attorney general there and you hand them the hard drives.
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:24.400]  I mean, let's just get out in the open.
[1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:26.480]  They're saying the surveillance state isn't happening.
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:31.480]  And aren't they crazy doc to admit they're surveilling the president and say they're not
[1:45:31.480 --> 1:45:32.840]  and say he's crazy.
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:33.840]  Don't they know?
[1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:36.680]  Or are they hoping he's going to bring out classified info and he's already accused them
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:37.680]  of that?
[1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:41.760]  They want to discredit Trump before he has the opportunity to reveal all this.
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:46.480]  What you've got is the Department of Justice, Underholder and Lynch saying they could prosecute
[1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:47.720]  a sheriff.
[1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:48.920]  They could rig the trial.
[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:49.920]  They could wiretap.
[1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:54.960]  They could judge tamper, get away with it, and one way or the other, find a way to put
[1:45:54.960 --> 1:45:55.960]  him in jail.
[1:45:55.960 --> 1:45:59.160]  Now, that's a standard of justice in the United States of America.
[1:45:59.160 --> 1:46:07.000]  We're all in danger because that's targeting using all these effective tools of surveillance,
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:10.960]  lying about it, illegally, unconstitutionally using them.
[1:46:10.960 --> 1:46:16.400]  And then if the president dares to put it out or is to mention it, then they discredit
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:17.400]  the president.
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:19.880]  It's in each state being in charge.
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:21.720]  Let's back off of this for a minute.
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:23.880]  Our government has been sold out to the Communist Chinese.
[1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:25.280]  I mean, I don't just say that.
[1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:27.280]  I told people six years ago they were bound up Hollywood.
[1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:28.400]  Now it's all over the news.
[1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:32.680]  I mean, all the intelligence ops, I know high level people, you name it, China, China,
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:34.040]  China, it's the threat.
[1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:35.040]  Trump knows that.
[1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:36.040]  Nobody gets the Chinese people.
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:38.880]  The horrible Communist Chinese that rule them, not Russia.
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:40.280]  Russia's not the issue.
[1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:43.520]  We radical Islam and China are the issues.
[1:46:43.520 --> 1:46:47.160]  China quite frankly worse than radical Islam as a total threat.
[1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:50.520]  They're threatening to nuke the United States and their own people's daily.
[1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:54.880]  North Korea has never been more belligerent, threatening to load missiles with atomic bombs
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:58.280]  that hit Seoul, South Korea or Tokyo, Japan.
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:00.200]  Tillerson has said they load those missiles.
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:01.200]  We've got to hit them.
[1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:05.040]  We've got cruise missiles five minutes off the coast, supersonic, you know, Mach 7 ready
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:10.000]  to Mach 7 that's classified above that word is they got like Mach 12.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:15.040]  And they can take about a matter of 60 seconds, probably they load those missiles.
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:18.160]  The world's never been in a more crazy position before Trump got in.
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:22.920]  But the elite seems to be accelerating it to stop nationalism like some world war will
[1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:24.080]  save them.
[1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:26.040]  What the hell's going on here?
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:32.120]  Well, it's the, the left is losing, the globalists are losing and they're desperate to destroy
[1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:37.920]  Trump, which they're trying to do with this Russian nonsense, they're trying to do with
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:38.920]  it.
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:39.920]  He wasn't wiretapped.
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:43.280]  What we're doing is we're showing the evidence, yeah, Trump was under surveillance in 2004.
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:46.000]  Sure, so what do we do to rally around him and stop them now?
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.600]  These, I mean, Pelosi doesn't even know who's president.
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:51.000]  Maxine Waters thinks Russia invaded Korea.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.480]  We can't let these lunatics destroy us.
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:48:00.320]  We have to demand, and I want to start with demanding, that Sheriff Arpile get a new trial.
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:05.960]  He gets the, the Department of Justice gets involved, you've got to have Congress involved.
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:11.520]  Sheriff Arpile is willing to go to Washington to meet with Congress, to meet with sessions,
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:13.400]  to meet with the president, to meet with anyone.
[1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:17.400]  There should be a press conference of this poor guy got surveilled and then drag all
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:19.120]  these prosecutors and people in.
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:25.640]  Right, and show that, I mean, this was criminal activity and behind, Holder, Loretta Lynch,
[1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:30.080]  Tom Perez, you know, now he's just going off and being head of the DNC.
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:35.120]  Yeah, I've never talked about this because it just gets too crazy, but there have been
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:39.160]  federal court cases and stuff where people are being surveilled, so they're being surveilled,
[1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:42.120]  while they're talking to me, but then it's in the file that I'm going to surveillance
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:43.120]  as well.
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:47.160]  And I get sent this stuff from lawyers in the cases, and I'm just too busy even mess
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:48.160]  with it, but it's real stuff.
[1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:51.160]  I mean, I've already seen all this NSA surveillance on me for years.
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:52.160]  But you're in the file.
[1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:54.160]  We, we, you know, we showed you your records.
[1:48:54.160 --> 1:48:57.080]  Of course I'm being watched and listened to, but exactly.
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:48:58.080]  But yeah.
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:06.240]  And, you know, and, and this is the point is that they lie to the NSA, the CIA lie, because
[1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:10.160]  they know, you know, you're going to believe them, the average person's going to believe
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:11.160]  Comey.
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:13.160]  They're going to believe clapper.
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:15.600]  They're going to believe because they wouldn't think these people would lie.
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:19.360]  These people are the best liars and they parse everything they say.
[1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:20.920]  So it's, you know, precise.
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:21.920]  It's all legal.
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:27.760]  It's all legal games of Americans who have been under electronic surveillance since at
[1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:28.760]  least 2004.
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:29.760]  Sure.
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:30.760]  Sure.
[1:49:30.760 --> 1:49:31.760]  I've got a job here.
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:32.760]  I want you to get back to work.
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:33.760]  Great job.
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:38.760]  I know they're going to pay you $20 a year.
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:40.340]  They're forming the world net daily.
[1:49:40.340 --> 1:49:45.660]  But, but, but let me just ask you this, and gut level, I think they're failing, I think
[1:49:45.660 --> 1:49:47.320]  they're going to get even more panicked.
[1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:49.420]  They're, they're really doing some desperate stuff.
[1:49:49.420 --> 1:49:52.760]  They caught a guy saying he was testing to get a bomb into the White House.
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:54.880]  There's a lot of crazy stuff going on.
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:50:01.320]  I just want listeners to understand words can't describe how dangerous and over the
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:02.320]  top.
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:03.320]  Everything is right now.
[1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:09.080]  this is, you know, a critical test. It's a war, and we're close to winning, which means
[1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:13.480]  that, you know, the left, the globalists are going to pull out all stops running for the
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:17.320]  finish line, and they're going to discredit everybody. Anybody who tries to tell the truth.
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:18.320]  A lot of hillmarys.
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:22.120]  Vicious. It's going to be vicious. And it's going to be vicious in the courts. It's going
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:27.880]  to be vicious. But I think the American people, as we've proved in this last election, and
[1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:35.400]  continue to, and are more awake every day, because, you know, they see, the average person
[1:50:35.400 --> 1:50:41.560]  knows when they're being lied to. And this, you know, government, and Obama's government,
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:46.480]  and it's got a root just about everybody out of the current government to get rid of them.
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:50.280]  And then half of them will get, try to get hired back again, which is also the problem.
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:54.040]  Yeah, so a bunch of entitled, spoiled, rotten criminals who have to understand we're never
[1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:57.360]  giving up, and they're going down. Thank you, Dr. Corsi. All right, the nuclear war news
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:50:59.760]  right ahead.
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:04.920]  Are you putting your money into an IRA, pension, or 401k? Then I hope you're prepared to lose

[1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:15.360]  crashes again. It's a question of when it's going to happen. Did you know there is a way
[1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:19.960]  you can protect and grow your wealth safely and predictably every single year? The people
[1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:24.560]  using this approach didn't lose a penny when the market crashed in 2000 or 2008, and they
[1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:29.200]  won't lose a penny in the next crash. In fact, their money will continue to grow safely
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:34.080]  year in and year out, even when stocks, real estate, and other investments tumble. A free

[1:52:59.520 --> 1:53:05.320]  Hi there, Dick Holgeier here. I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:11.800]  I normally never do commercial endorsements. I am very skeptical of health supplements,
[1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:17.440]  but a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One, so I purchased a bottle,
[1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:22.440]  and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now. I very much dislike so-called
[1:53:22.440 --> 1:53:27.840]  energy boosters, those little energy drinks that have caffeine and Gerana and other things
[1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:33.720]  that make your heart race. This is not that. My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:39.840]  My mood is better. My joints feel better. I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:46.040]  productivity. My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more, so I recommend Synergy
[1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:50.000]  One. It's really good stuff. I'm having great results with it.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com. That's oneworldwhy.com.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:35.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:54.080]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:54:54.080 --> 1:55:06.960]  He's a propo fitting that Trump's cut in the funding, 50% of the U.N., kicking the globalist
[1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:12.680]  out, not letting him sit here and suck off the American people. It is certainly an omen,
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:18.200]  is it not, a fitting omen of their misfortune and their failure by Hillary denying she was
[1:55:18.200 --> 1:55:24.560]  falling down the next day, falls down on TV there on 9-11.
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:30.680]  Globalists freak out over Trump's proposed U.N. cuts, infowars.com. I was watching during
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:33.720]  the break the live hearings and they had these different Democratic Congress people
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:40.600]  going, is Russia our enemy? Yes they are. And I find it interesting that Roger Stone and
[1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:46.760]  Manafort were hired for their Russian connections and fired for them. Manafort and them worked
[1:55:46.760 --> 1:55:53.760]  for the Republicans since Nixon and the ones that introduced Trump to Nixon and then Reagan.
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:56:00.480]  But see, they've now made them Russians in the news, because Manafort did some stuff
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:06.040]  for Ukraine, did it in Latin American countries too. I'm trying to, by the way, bring Ukraine
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:14.880]  into the EU, by the way. Just like Trump just, so we can use our coal and gas prices on natural
[1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:18.560]  gas plummeted, which actually hurts Russia. And he's not trying to hurt Russia, just
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:24.280]  sorry America first. But you look at these traders, these pieces of crap in Congress,
[1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:28.120]  the cowardly Republicans, the sellout Democrats, all their plane along, all the guys in their
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:33.960]  military outfits, all these yes men generals. And they're up there when they work for the
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:38.080]  foreign globalist power that's hijacked this country, acting like Trump's the enemy and
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:41.720]  acting like Trump's the problem. When they're the ones that gave North Korea the weapons,
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:44.560]  when they're the ones that sold us out to Islam, when they're the ones that sold us
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:47.920]  out to communist China in our jobs. And then here comes a guy trying to be decent, and
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:52.240]  they run around saying he's a foreign agent. When Hillary was on the communist Chinese
[1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:57.440]  payroll publicly, it's incredible. This world being so unstable, if they bring down Trump,
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:00.920]  which they're trying to do, they're trying to demonize him before they kill him. You
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:04.040]  need high-quality, swarable foods. I know I've increased the amounts I've got. People
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:08.240]  keep thinking, oh, go back to sleep. Trump's saying, oh, yeah, get ready. We really should
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:12.440]  do this once a year. I'm doing it every few months now. It's 30 to 40% off all the high-quality
[1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:18.000]  swarable foods that are fresh, produced right here in America by MyPatreonSupply. They already
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:21.280]  had the lowest prices out there. We have their full spectrum, this dropship from them. We
[1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:26.280]  have their full catalog. But under InfoWare Select, we can discount it, even though it's

[1:58:19.400 --> 1:58:23.840]  our stuff out. Wouldn't be anybody out there that'll put out the hardcore stuff. You just
[1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:29.560]  saw today about Trump with the documents surveilled by Obama in the NSA. Nobody without us. Without

[1:58:44.120 --> 1:58:50.560]  hour stay with us. GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:50.560 --> 1:58:55.040]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the
[1:58:55.040 --> 1:58:59.560]  best new off-the-grid products of 2017. And seriously, I really think everyone should
[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:03.440]  have one of these. I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at
[1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:07.920]  Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors. The PPX is so small you can put
[1:59:07.920 --> 1:59:12.520]  it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house. Like
[1:59:12.520 --> 1:59:16.360]  a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling. Plus, you can take it with
[1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:21.320]  you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes. The system
[1:59:21.320 --> 1:59:25.000]  provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:30.400]  private power grid, literally anywhere in the world. Perfect for cabins, remote locations,
[1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:35.000]  any time you need to get off the grid for a while. Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch

[1:59:52.560 --> 2:00:06.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:11.840]  Rev Run, is this some conspiracy? Crucify for no sins.
[2:00:11.840 --> 2:00:15.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance that you are listening
[2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:23.640]  to Alex Jones. Rev Run, is this some conspiracy?
[2:00:23.640 --> 2:00:28.560]  You know, it doesn't make me feel tough to be politically involved and see what we do
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:34.440]  having massive effects makes me feel ashamed. Because I look at all these strong smart men
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:39.760]  around me, and they just think watching TV all day and acting tough and drinking cases
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:45.520]  of beer is what a man does. I'm not saying drinking beer is a bad thing. I'd get to turn
[2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:50.160]  your brain off sometime, don't you? I don't know one thing. We got scum trying to destroy
[2:00:50.160 --> 2:00:55.760]  the first good president we've had a long time. There's an epic battle going on and
[2:00:55.760 --> 2:01:00.480]  Trump's just shoveling prosperity at the people. All that stolen prosperity of the elites
[2:01:00.480 --> 2:01:06.960]  took by a managed economy, a monopoly economy. I watch a bunch of cowards and trash just
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:13.480]  want to act cool around other people and join in on the Trump bashing when they don't deserve
[2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:19.160]  somebody like that standing up for them. And that's how the elites get a lot of good men
[2:01:19.160 --> 2:01:21.520]  to join them as they say, look, the public doesn't want your help. They're a bunch of
[2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:26.120]  trash. Go ahead and try to help them. They're scum. Feed on them. Here's the difference.
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:28.760]  I know there are a lot of good people that do know the truth who are fighting back, trying
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:33.360]  to be moral. And even though they're a minority of every race, color, and creed, they deserve
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:38.240]  to not be slaves, and I don't stand up for them. And I'm never, just because the average
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:42.960]  person is like a brain damaged robot now, left in their cribs, never touched by their
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:47.200]  parents while they worked, didn't get proper fat in mother's milk. Their brains are about
[2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:52.800]  third smaller than they should be. I see white zombies, black zombies, Hispanic zombies,
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:02:07.120]  you name it. Just everybody's Zombo and Zombo and bad. I saw a TV ad when I was in Stephen
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:11.600] ville this weekend doing some hog hunting with my son. We're staying at a hotel and
[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:18.200]  I had the TV on the morning for a few minutes, looking for some news. And I just saw this
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:22.600]  ad saying, don't sleep with your baby in the bed with you. The crib's the way to go or
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:29.360]  it'll die. Now, instant, sudden infant death syndrome is vaccines. They always die the
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:32.880]  night of the, you know, night after or whatever. Inflammation on the brain. They stop breathing
[2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:37.760]  on portal things. The brainstems swell up. I Googled that yesterday. I couldn't find
[2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:43.440]  it. Maybe somebody around here came, but that's so sick. The industrial age, they didn't want
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:46.960]  parents anymore. They want everything industrialized. They wanted kids raised with formula. Some
[2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:50.520]  mothers should be working in factories. And of course, they designed the formula to cause
[2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:57.120]  a small brain on purpose, to cause a kind of a servile, all just actually brave new world.
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:01.080]  And obviously wrote nonfiction books about that. So did his brother at the UN, officially
[2:03:01.080 --> 2:03:05.920]  running the programs that UNESCO to do that. And I'm not judging mothers to give their
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:14.960]  kids formula. There's better ones than others. The old fashioned things, goats, milk or Jenny
[2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:24.640]  milk, a jackass milk, female jackass, donkey milk. But that's fact that a child that isn't
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:28.840]  held in the first six months up against their mother and father up against skin doesn't
[2:03:28.840 --> 2:03:34.120]  feel the heartbeat. It's electromagnetic. Doesn't sleep in between you in the bed. That's all
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:37.960]  the baby ever wants to get in is in the bed with you know that if you don't sleep with
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:42.200]  your kids, they're IQ is probably 10 to 15 points. There's a bunch of studies. Some of
[2:03:42.200 --> 2:03:45.600]  them show more. If you leave them in a crib and then you give them formula and you put
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:53.600]  them in front of TV, that's not a person. I guess they found it. Yeah, there was a,
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:57.720]  there's a sleep PSA. It's like 10 seconds long. It's like, it's a mother and father sleeping
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:01.360]  a little baby between them. And they just say, don't do this. It's not safe. Let me see
[2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:06.400]  if this is the same one. No, it's another one. It shows like a black man, a black woman
[2:04:06.400 --> 2:04:11.160]  with their baby. Oh yeah. It says your kid will be in a grave if you sleep with your
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:20.800]  kid. God. I mean, what mammal when, when, when, whether it's hedgehogs or dogs, wolves,
[2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:26.040]  tigers, elephants, what, what mammal when it sleeps, does the baby not come up and get
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:35.080]  right up against mommy to keep warm, but also keep safe. They say, don't sleep with your
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:41.280]  kid. Hell, they'll probably have cold bear. Take that out of context. Sam, raping kids
[2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:44.880]  or something. You're just a bunch of trash. And you know what? You got it on your heads,
[2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:48.880]  everything you did to the people. Like Christ said, you do the least of me done to me better
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:52.480]  if you tie a millstone around your neck and throw it in the ocean. All of us should thank
[2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:59.480]  God that we're not these traders and these scum. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[2:04:59.480 --> 2:05:07.200]  Robo Bezos. The CIA affiliated owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, donned a robo
[2:05:07.200 --> 2:05:12.120]  suit straight out of Avatar. Bezos hopped in the pilot seat of the 13 foot mobile hunk
[2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:16.560]  of metal with arms and legs mimicking those of a humans. He smiled for the cameras and
[2:05:16.560 --> 2:05:21.600]  said with a smile, bow down before your new king and master. The robot he was operating
[2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:26.400]  is the method two built by the South Korean company, Handcooked Marais. It operates with
[2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:31.320]  two joysticks to control the arms and leg pedals to control the legs. The robot does
[2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:35.680]  still need support in order to stand, essentially still in training wheels, but the giant metal
[2:05:35.680 --> 2:05:39.960]  puppet is certainly turning heads in the tech industry. While it is all fun and games for
[2:05:39.960 --> 2:05:44.880]  now, keep in mind, robot police are now a reality with more law enforcement, including
[2:05:44.880 --> 2:05:49.720]  in the U.S., looking to robot police in the future. The military has also said it wants
[2:05:49.720 --> 2:05:56.600]  to move away from humans and more towards robots. Is the robo arms race on? For Infowars.com,
[2:05:56.600 --> 2:06:00.120]  this is Owen Troyer.
[2:06:00.120 --> 2:06:05.080]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[2:06:05.080 --> 2:06:10.000]  before it became a loss to our modern diets, a processed junk. We are now introducing Caveman
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:15.640]  by InfowarsLife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root,
[2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:22.200]  chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula. Caveman,
[2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:26.200]  it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:30.840]  superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that. Everyone knew that
[2:06:30.840 --> 2:06:34.720]  you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for
[2:06:34.720 --> 2:06:40.160]  cooking, but you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full of minerals
[2:06:40.160 --> 2:06:44.720]  and Kiko factors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine
[2:06:44.720 --> 2:06:49.360]  of the life essence. I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure
[2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:53.400]  as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big
[2:06:53.400 --> 2:06:56.800]  part of it. I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula

[2:08:23.160 --> 2:08:49.440]  with
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:09:14.840]  the
[2:09:14.840 --> 2:09:20.480]  God love them. My parents were like America first, you know, libertarian right-wingers.
[2:09:20.480 --> 2:09:27.160]  I just I just cannot get my mind wrapped around wanting to blow up a free open society and
[2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:30.840]  running around screaming and yelling and bitching at everybody about how they hate women they
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:31.840]  want to bring Muslims in.
[2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:36.040]  I know there's some Muslims that are great people. They're heretics. They want to leave
[2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:40.080]  because in Islam they say now that I've studied it than a crash course the last five years
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:45.320]  House of War is where Islam is not. But Horowitz is the expert on this and I had him coming
[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:50.200]  on about that in his new book The Big Agenda. I mean Trump best numbers on small business
[2:09:50.200 --> 2:09:54.960]  is 1984, peak of the Reagan recovery, three trillion in the stock market just everything
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:58.440]  he's doing for the little guy but it's also making the rich guys a ton of money and they
[2:09:58.440 --> 2:10:04.400]  want to destroy him and they are just they say I'm a Russian dupe, Roger Stone's a Russian
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:08.600]  agent I mean so he wants to talk about the hearings. I'm glad he does because I was
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:11.440]  going to say hey we're going to talk about this but you come on about that. I just want
[2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:15.520]  to know because he's an expert on the left. He really knows how they operate. I guess
[2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:18.920]  he was one of them. I don't mean that insulting when he admits he was. I just now they're
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:23.320]  all how bad they are. I just can't believe that it didn't even exist. It's like Nazis
[2:10:23.320 --> 2:10:27.400]  or something or communists. It's just what the hell is going on here but I guess a lot
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:31.320]  of them are victims that get sucked into it. I don't understand it all. I got a blind spot
[2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:37.080]  and so I look at North Korean places in Venezuela and I just say I mean capitalism ain't perfect
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:40.600]  but it's pretty damn good. That's why everybody wants to come here. I know rocket scientists
[2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:44.040]  but you know I know there's a lot more choices here. A lot more freedom here. A lot more
[2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:47.880]  opportunity here and I've been to some of these terrible countries so going to Horowitz
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:51.760]  I'm going to skip the breaks we have more time. He's an American conservative writer,
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:55.480]  founder and current president of the Think Tank. They have Horowitz Freedom Center. He
[2:10:55.480 --> 2:11:01.240]  also writes what FrontPageMagazine.com and a bunch of other big publications. He's also
[2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:07.320]  worked as a column for Ceylon. The editor, Josh Walsh, described him as a conservative.
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:12.120]  I'm not going to go again over all his background but until 1975 he was an outspoken inherent
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:18.920]  of the new left. So he joins us now to talk about the state of the world. A lot of people
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:22.720]  told me like Roger Stone when he was here in election night, relax. There'll be prosperity.
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:27.200]  People will be happy. I said they're not going to stop. I saw the crazed behavior. I see
[2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:31.840]  the left yell at me in public and threaten me. I've never seen anything like this. It's
[2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:37.480]  total mental illness. So perhaps David Horowitz, one of the top experts on this disease can
[2:11:37.480 --> 2:11:39.760]  break down what's happening. David, thanks for joining us.
[2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:47.400]  Thank you, Alex. It is a disease. Look, the left is a crypto religious movement or a religious
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:55.600]  cult and by left I include the Democratic Party, progressives. They have all these names
[2:11:55.600 --> 2:12:01.720]  that hide what they actually are. But they believe the world is a fallen place although
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:08.920]  they wouldn't use such an expression. It's a place of oppression, a hierarchy, domination
[2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:14.680]  and so forth. And they believe in a redemption. But the redemption is going to be carried
[2:12:14.680 --> 2:12:24.280]  out by them instead of a divinity. True religions understand that we're the problem. It's people
[2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:30.560]  that are the problem. And therefore, you really can't fix it. And that's why conservatives
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:36.360]  are prone to a kind of fatalistic view. Things are probably going to get worse. And that
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:45.000]  handicaps them in this battle. But for the left, there's this promised land. I'm afraid
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:51.280]  the Jews are responsible for this idea. There's this promised land, which used to be called
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:57.440]  communism or socialism, but now it's called social justice, where all their dreams are
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:13:02.320]  going to be fulfilled. So if you understand that they're a religious cult, you will also
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:09.280]  understand that they see themselves as the army of the saints. And they see the rest
[2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:16.560]  of us, those who don't go along with their program as the party of the devil.
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:23.240]  And in fact, that's what they say. It's just wild. So Rachel Maddow, college professors,
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:29.960]  they're all in the priesthood. That's right. And they see that's what they talk like hellfire
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:36.360]  and damnation preachers all the time. That's why the Democrats are so effective politically.
[2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:44.680]  Everything they say is a moral indictment. Republicans talk like accountants. It doesn't
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:53.600]  motivate people as powerfully as the left's vision does. And it doesn't kill their enemies,
[2:13:53.600 --> 2:14:03.600]  but we're in the left's resort to calling you a racist, sexist, homophobe, deplorable.
[2:14:03.600 --> 2:14:11.320]  The Democratic Party is a party of hate. It runs on hate all the time. And that sort of
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:18.720]  glues up their mind. So when they see Islam, they see people of color because they're
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:29.720]  racists. The term people of color is a racist term. We don't speak that way in English.
[2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:31.720]  There they are.
[2:14:31.720 --> 2:14:37.680]  So it's cult programming, exactly. So where are they now? What's happening in them worldwide?
[2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:43.360]  Why are they tripling their viciousness? Well, because they see what Trump is a serious
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:51.960]  threat. Brexit is a threat. They like governments which are completely unresponsive to the people
[2:14:51.960 --> 2:14:56.400]  because the people are the problem. That's why they put so many people in the gulag and
[2:14:56.400 --> 2:15:02.040]  shoot so many people when they get the power because they have a program to really... Exactly.
[2:15:02.040 --> 2:15:06.000]  Their religion has reduced the Earth's population. David Rockefeller, Bill Gates, they're the
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:11.560]  high priest of all this. And their final secret, I guess, that you learn in the cult is people
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:13.280]  are the problem, kill everybody.
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:19.760]  Well, yeah, that's the end game. But along the way, people are the problem because they
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:28.480]  just... They don't go along with their socialist ideas. This is the problem. They got defeated
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:32.760]  in the election. They can't accept that. So they call it a resistance. And this is true.
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:36.080]  You predicted 20-plus years ago exactly what would happen in the future. Now I've read
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:39.800]  most of your books. Then tell us, looking forward, Mr. Horowitz, what's going to happen
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:44.040]  in the future if we don't really take action? And what we should do to stop these people
[2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:46.280]  because they're clearly bloodthirsty authoritarians.
[2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:51.560]  Well, yeah. I mean, I heard Feinstein said the other day that their strategy is to impeach
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:57.520]  Trump. That's what these hearings are about. And these hearings show how stupid Republicans
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:06.600]  are. Why would Devin Nunes call a hearing on the Russian collusion when there's no evidence
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:07.600]  of it?
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:09.600]  He's playing along like a little cuck-coward.
[2:16:09.600 --> 2:16:16.720]  Well, no, yes, it's because they think they can appease these people. He thinks that, okay,
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:21.400]  we'll hold hearings and then they'll see we're reasonable and we actually want to see...
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:24.200]  No, it goes weakness and they attack more.
[2:16:24.200 --> 2:16:29.720]  Exactly. That's not what the hearings are about. I mean, these Democrats, they don't
[2:16:29.720 --> 2:16:33.720]  even ask questions that Comey can answer. They read indictments.
[2:16:33.720 --> 2:16:36.720]  They just say, is Russia the enemy?
[2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:38.720]  And it's all coordinated.
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:42.800]  Then they go, is Trump talking to Russia? Well, of course, the president talks to Russia.
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:45.440]  That's this new thing. Like, if he ever talks to Russia, it's illegal.
[2:16:45.440 --> 2:16:52.360]  His right mind could think that Trump is colluding with the Russians against America. The only
[2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:55.040]  people who are capable of that are Democrats.
[2:16:55.040 --> 2:16:59.600]  In fact, you're an expert unless your parents were involved in it. I mean, the whole history,
[2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:01.640]  it's always Democrats with the Russians.
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:06.680]  My mother was a card-carrying communist and a registered Democrat. And there are lots
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:11.920]  of those, lots of them. But you don't have to be a member of the Communist Party to think
[2:17:11.920 --> 2:17:18.040]  like a communist. You just have to believe that there's an earthly redemption called
[2:17:18.040 --> 2:17:26.160]  social justice or communism. Same thing. And that if you get enough power and you demonize
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:31.200]  your opponents enough and destroy them, you can achieve this wonderful redemption.
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:35.920]  Meanwhile, they call us bullies. So what's their plan to get Trump out? And if they get
[2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:38.360]  him out, what do we expect? And how do we stop him?
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:44.360]  Well, they're playing that. First, it's the Torian with this Russia brush. But look, they've
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:48.840]  driven. Trump has done so many. I mean, you've discussed some of the amazing things he's
[2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:52.600]  already done. It's only two months. You know, he's got the stock market.
[2:17:52.600 --> 2:17:56.040]  Which, by the way, your book breaks down. Let's talk about your book.
[2:17:56.040 --> 2:18:00.880]  Big agenda. Trump's playing the save America. Yeah, I have all the things that you knew
[2:18:00.880 --> 2:18:06.440]  he was going to do. You know, during the campaign, when he was a little bit more unknown, what
[2:18:06.440 --> 2:18:13.320]  he would do as a politician, people said, oh, he's not going to fulfill any of his promises.
[2:18:13.320 --> 2:18:17.880]  But here's the guy who puts his name on everything he does, puts his name on his buildings, his
[2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:23.200]  resorts, his airplanes. His whole, his whole dynasty is about legacy, is about delivering.
[2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:28.640]  His reputation. There's no way on earth. He's not going to build the wall.
[2:18:28.640 --> 2:18:32.960]  That's why he's doing it. And so they get more and more enraged.
[2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:39.040]  Exactly. Well, they don't hear and they don't see. I mean, it's so hypocritical. He or Hillary
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:45.200]  actually violated the espionage laws. She lied to the FBI. She lied to the public. She lied
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:51.360]  to the Congress. She shared our secrets with all our enemies, not just Russia, but Russia,
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:58.760]  India, Iran, China, and the total projection, everything they say about Trump.
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:04.200]  Correct. In fact, it's almost sickening how good he is. He's like so good compared to
[2:19:04.200 --> 2:19:09.360]  them. It's such upside down world. Then they project everything they are admittedly onto
[2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:13.920]  this guy who's got the whole corrupt elite against him because he's delivering prosperity.
[2:19:13.920 --> 2:19:19.400]  Correct. Once you understand it's a religious cult, they don't think.
[2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:22.880]  And by the way, Bannon admits he reads you. He wants to break their cult. Those are his
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:26.440]  writings. Obviously inspired by your truth, because you're just seeing objective truth.
[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:30.840]  We're like following Horowitz here. It's true. It's a cult. They're the new priesthood. They
[2:19:30.840 --> 2:19:34.800]  want to take over like Jim Jones or something or North Korea. And then Trump wants to break
[2:19:34.800 --> 2:19:41.560]  the cult by prosperity and independence. Yes. You know, when you're talking about your upbringing
[2:19:41.560 --> 2:19:48.680]  and my upbringing in the communist progressive Democrat world was to see the world entirely
[2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:54.760]  in terms of oppression. There are people who are oppressed and there are oppressors. And
[2:19:54.760 --> 2:20:00.720]  as I said, that phrase, people of color, that's the key. It's not English. We don't say, here's
[2:20:00.720 --> 2:20:06.760]  a box of crayons of color. That's the way French people talk. But if you call them
[2:20:06.760 --> 2:20:12.360]  colored people, you're a racist. So what is the function of this ideological construct
[2:20:12.360 --> 2:20:18.920]  people of color? Well, look at Mexico. It's got two main ethnic groups, the descendants
[2:20:18.920 --> 2:20:25.560]  of the Spanish conquistadors who slaughtered the indigenous Indians and the descendants
[2:20:25.560 --> 2:20:31.640]  of the survivors of the indigenous Indians. But when they cross the border into America,
[2:20:31.640 --> 2:20:37.280]  they're both people of color, therefore oppressed, therefore deserving certain sensitivities
[2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:43.760]  and certain privileges. But if you think further, Maharajas in India are people of color. The
[2:20:43.760 --> 2:20:48.840]  beheaders, the Islamic beheaders in Raqqa are people. Sure. I mean, I mean, it's a way to
[2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:53.160]  just take classical racism that we've heard over the last 200 years here and just flip
[2:20:53.160 --> 2:20:59.280]  it. Exactly right. The only people in the world who aren't people of color, and therefore
[2:20:59.280 --> 2:21:07.240]  are oppressors, not oppressed, are white people. This is a massive anti-white racism that the
[2:21:07.240 --> 2:21:12.840]  Democratic Party, that's what it's about. They look at your origins. It's why they do
[2:21:12.840 --> 2:21:17.240]  all these gotcha moments. You have money. I've also found the left, it always gets caught
[2:21:17.240 --> 2:21:20.840]  funding, the white supremacist movements, like the Topgall, really be a federal agent,
[2:21:20.840 --> 2:21:24.760]  and the people under them, they're running around. It's very sophisticated. Or Soros
[2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:27.920]  funding all the Black Lives Matter groups. I mean, what's all that about? Just I guess
[2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:34.200]  a strategy of tension? Black, well, blacks are the battering ram to destroy the system.
[2:21:34.200 --> 2:21:40.720]  Those blacks that follow organizations like Black Lives Matter is a racist organization.
[2:21:40.720 --> 2:21:45.840]  The left has always been anti-police. I mean, that's what we hated. The police are an occupying
[2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:50.480]  force in our country. That's the way the left... And the police should be good or bad, but
[2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:55.240]  the point is they want control in the bullying of the police to then persecute everybody.
[2:21:55.240 --> 2:22:00.560]  The police are bad because they protect property. And you have to think like a leftist. That's
[2:22:00.560 --> 2:22:06.120]  the way they think. So Black Lives Matter, of course, Soros is funding them. Soros is
[2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:12.480]  an anti-American self-hating Jew is what he is. Yeah. What is his problem? I mean, this
[2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:16.280]  country gives him freedom, everything. He tries to destroy it. His problem is he's a very
[2:22:16.280 --> 2:22:21.320]  corrupt individual. By the way, the WikiLeaks came out, but you called him a self-hating
[2:22:21.320 --> 2:22:25.800]  Jew a long time ago. It's in there that he wants to destroy Israel and is creeping around.
[2:22:25.800 --> 2:22:30.080]  And then Israel has all these articles defending him and attacking Trump, although in a lot
[2:22:30.080 --> 2:22:34.720]  of their newspapers like Horitz, making up crap that I like Hitler with no proof and
[2:22:34.720 --> 2:22:39.360]  that he likes Hitler. What is going on with that? Like a Nazi collaborator wants to destroy
[2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:44.040]  Israel, but he's good in Israel and then I don't want to destroy Israel, so I'm Hitler.
[2:22:44.040 --> 2:22:48.040]  Those are their weapons. They don't care about the facts. They're not interested in the
[2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:54.040]  facts. They're just, they see the world as polarized between the oppressors and the oppressed.
[2:22:54.040 --> 2:22:58.160]  And if you defend America, if you defend- There's a matter of it's a leftist Jew or a leftist
[2:22:58.160 --> 2:23:06.280]  guy from Africa or who it is, they just think the same. Exactly. Exactly. Across the world.
[2:23:06.280 --> 2:23:12.840]  Why are they so soft on Islamic terrorists? Because they're people of color. It's a crazy
[2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:19.560]  world. David Horowitz, let's talk about ways- Your top points. Because I'm asking the questions
[2:23:19.560 --> 2:23:22.000]  here, but I'm sure you've got a lot of key points you want to make. The six, seven minutes
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:26.440]  we have left. Advice to Trump, advice to America. Because I mean, you are somebody that really
[2:23:26.440 --> 2:23:32.280]  was the first person I heard about the caliphate and syria law and the lefts made a deal.
[2:23:32.280 --> 2:23:35.760]  And I was just like, give me a break. Because I never thought they would just trash a lot
[2:23:35.760 --> 2:23:39.160]  of their leftist views of freedom, equality that sounded good. But I guess that was their
[2:23:39.160 --> 2:23:44.440]  way to get power. That was all just talk. Yeah, you know, I understand your puzzlement
[2:23:44.440 --> 2:23:53.960]  because even I, when Saddam Hussein swallowed Kuwait, and if you'll remember, I mean, the
[2:23:53.960 --> 2:24:00.600]  Democrats did not want to support even that war. I waited to see if the- I said, is the
[2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:07.640]  left willing to support Saddam Hussein, this mass murderer, a monster? And sure enough,
[2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:12.240]  they did. They've supported every enemy of the United States since the Second World
[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:16.480]  War. That's just who they are. They hate America.
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:20.880]  So you know them better than most, to say at least. David Horowitz, the big agenda-messing
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:26.320]  author. What do they do next? Well, I think they're going to carry out this campaign until
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:31.240]  they destroy the Trump presidency. And what does he do to stop them?
[2:24:31.240 --> 2:24:38.360]  Well, instinctively, he knows how to fight. You have to be the aggressor. You have to
[2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:44.280]  be on offense all the time. Do not defend yourself. The mistakes they've made were mistakes
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:49.160]  that Trump allowed himself to be overridden. They should never have.
[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:52.760]  Exactly. I'm not just kissing Trump's ass. It's true. Every mistake's been done. Like,
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:57.360]  he didn't tell sessions to recuse. He didn't apologize. He reversed that. And he needs
[2:24:57.360 --> 2:25:01.400]  to tell his people, you do what I execute and say, not what you want.
[2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:09.600]  And it wasn't his idea to go with the second immigration, you know, temporary ban either
[2:25:09.600 --> 2:25:15.080]  and eliminate a ramp from the countries. They should have constructed it a little better.
[2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:18.560]  Because they're not dealing with another side that wants to make compromises. They want
[2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:23.640]  to literally overrun everything. Exactly. They're not there. You know, when
[2:25:23.640 --> 2:25:27.960]  you compromise, you're just giving it. It's, you know, it's not compromise. It's Neville
[2:25:27.960 --> 2:25:31.120]  Chamberlain all over again. Yeah, exactly. You know, I have a letter
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:34.560]  from Hitler. He's not going to invade France. And then he invades it a week later. So going
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:40.000]  back to this, the time we have left, the racist party, that's the first words that need to
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:45.160]  be on every Republican's lips. There's a chapter of my book, Big Agenda.
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:49.000]  Well, that's what got Trump in was being honest about the Democrats being a right-space party.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:54.080]  Yeah, but he was right. And you just keep driving it home. And again, we're not saying
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:57.240]  everybody that's in its racist. Hey, this is a race-spreading party. You shouldn't be
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:25:58.880]  in it if you're part of that.
[2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:03.640]  It's personal, Alex. The chapter of my book is called the Achilles' Seal of Democratic
[2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:04.640]  Party.
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:12.480]  The Democratic Party owns every major inner city in America, every killing field. Detroit,
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:19.920]  Chicago, Ferguson, St. Louis, Baltimore, 100% controlled by the Democratic Party.
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:22.400]  And they're hellholes. It's their fault.
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:29.720]  Exactly. And look, they're very clever at the political battle. So when he says these
[2:26:29.720 --> 2:26:36.240]  killing fields, they say he's being racist against the inner city, running down the inner
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:42.680]  city. It's so absurd. But people can see that. But I don't hear Republicans saying that
[2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:45.600]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz or Donald Brzee are...
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:49.540]  Exactly. They're intimidated. Trump's not. Don't they see from his example not being
[2:26:49.540 --> 2:26:52.160]  intimidated when you have the moral high ground as the answer?
[2:26:52.160 --> 2:26:57.120]  Here's the thing, Alex. When you think about it, the three key people in that administration,
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:04.400]  Donald Trump, Stephen Bannon, and Steve Miller, all come from the left. They're all, uh,
[2:27:04.400 --> 2:27:07.520]  were in, really, Democrat union.
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:09.240]  They know how to respond back.
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:11.160]  They have the passion.
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:15.640]  No, you're right. The so-called right-winger, a bunch of stuffed shirts, a bunch of cowards,
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:19.440]  a bunch of accountants, who literally just roll over to the media and are scared of it
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:22.320]  and have no instincts for victory. You're absolutely right.
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:28.200]  Correct. And my big agenda is really a guide to how to fight this battle. But the first
[2:27:28.200 --> 2:27:34.320]  rule is you fight fire with fire. You don't retreat. You don't back down. And you go for
[2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:40.440]  their jugular. They're the ones who own all, oh, how many blacks have been murdered because
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:42.560]  of Democrats in this country?
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:45.640]  That's like 3,000 a year in Chicago, and they blame it on Trump.
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:51.760]  Exactly. They have these gun control laws in Chicago and other Democrat cities that
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:58.360]  deprive law-abiding black citizens in high crime areas of the only protection that they'll
[2:27:58.360 --> 2:27:59.360]  get.
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:01.160]  And then they wonder why the areas are crime magnets.
[2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:06.920]  They have catch-and-release policies for convicted felons. That's how Dwayne Wade's cousin,
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:09.520]  a mother of four children, was murdered.
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:12.240]  And then they know they've been destroying black communities and every other community
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:15.600]  they control. They turn it all around about a race narrative to project on everybody what
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:18.200]  they've done. They consciously know their slugs.
[2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:24.640]  And they're anti-Americans and they're liars. But you name me, one Republican besides Trump
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:28.120]  who on national TV would have looked Hillary Clinton in the eye and said,
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:29.120]  So you're a criminal.
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:35.760]  You're a liar and a crook, which he is both. And that's because they're either too polite
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:37.560]  or too cowardly to do it.
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:41.600]  You're right. Yeah, Trump's only thing is letting his people speak for him. And these
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:44.080]  Gallup polls are fake. Like I told her by during the election, they're fake. They're
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:45.080]  going back to their fake polls.
[2:28:45.080 --> 2:28:48.920]  All right, well, David Horowitz, the book's the biggest. I've read it. It's amazing.
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:53.920]  I have a website called Black Book of the American Left. I've written seven, actually,
[2:28:53.920 --> 2:29:00.920]  nine. It'll be nine volumes when it's complete, just about the left and how they think. I
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:03.560]  would be happy to send you a set.
[2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:06.880]  Please do. Let's have you back on some time for a full hour to, with graphs or something,
[2:29:06.880 --> 2:29:10.360]  walk through them all. But yeah, no, you're dead on David Horowitz. And I just think in
[2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:14.280]  my gut though, I think Trump's going to strike back. I think we're going to win. What do
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:15.280]  you think?
[2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:18.720]  I hope so. I fear that they're going to assassinate him.
[2:29:18.720 --> 2:29:22.640]  Yeah, I got a bad feeling. I'm trying to be positive here, but it's just 50-50. I think
[2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:26.560]  it's up to us and what we do now. How much we speak out, how much we get involved.
[2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:31.800]  You have a good audience. Get everybody out there. Get out and fight. Fight at every level.
[2:29:31.800 --> 2:29:37.080]  Go to those town hall meetings. Confront them. Defend Trump and his agendas.
[2:29:37.080 --> 2:29:42.440]  Sure, David. On Drudge, we have a report with NSA documents that we're spying on, on Trump
[2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:45.200]  proven. I hope you'll get those out to your audience. We've also got to work together
[2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:48.640]  as patriots. Thank you so much, David. We'll be back. Stay with us. Roger Stelman breaking

[2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:04.440]  The House Intelligence Committee hearing today on Russia in the 2016 elections has been quite
[2:30:04.440 --> 2:30:09.560]  the fake news anti-Trump double standard ceremony. Led by the anti-Trump team of Schiff, Comey
[2:30:09.560 --> 2:30:14.960]  and Nunes, the 2020 Globalist Democrat campaign for U.S. President has begun. Admiral Rogers
[2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:19.480]  of the NSA could not answer many questions due to national security and classified information.
[2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:23.440]  The hearing was loaded with canned questions, responses, and lawyer talk. The Trump-Russian
[2:30:23.440 --> 2:30:29.040]  narrative echoed with, there was no wiretapping, attacks peppered in. So now, U.S. officials
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:33.640]  are discussing the investigation of Russian influence on the Trump campaign and the election,
[2:30:33.640 --> 2:30:38.800]  but at the same time attacking Trump for claiming he was being investigated by the U.S. government
[2:30:38.800 --> 2:30:44.760]  during these investigations. 1984 double think in the flesh. Understand this. This hearing
[2:30:44.760 --> 2:30:48.440]  and all other related hearings or narratives are nothing more than the Globalist Democrat
[2:30:48.440 --> 2:30:53.000]  U.S. presidential campaign for 2020. They will try to de-legitimize President Trump
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:58.320]  with fake news, then attack him on it the entire 2020 campaign. For Infowars.com, this

[2:31:59.840 --> 2:32:04.960]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:09.200]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk. We are now introducing
[2:32:09.200 --> 2:32:14.520]  Caveman by InfowarsLife.com. The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth,
[2:32:14.520 --> 2:32:20.320]  turmeric root, chaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting
[2:32:20.320 --> 2:32:25.320]  formula. Caveman. It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[2:32:25.320 --> 2:32:30.040]  that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[2:32:30.040 --> 2:32:34.040]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance,
[2:32:34.040 --> 2:32:39.360]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength. From the outside structure full
[2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:43.400]  of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This
[2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:48.840]  is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were but
[2:32:48.840 --> 2:32:52.880]  I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this
[2:32:52.880 --> 2:32:56.280]  is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out Caveman ultimate paleo
[2:32:56.280 --> 2:33:08.040]  formula for yourself at InfowarsLife.com today.
[2:33:08.040 --> 2:33:14.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[2:33:14.320 --> 2:33:32.720]  GCN Radio Network. Listen to this guitar right here. I deserve this. You deserve to hear
[2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:47.000]  it too. Deep purple. It's coming right here. A lot better on Hi-Fi. Now on your AM radio.
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  Listen to this. And right here. Yeah baby. That's some of the best stuff out there. That
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:17.680] 's the soul. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. That's a good liner for the Alex Jones
[2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:20.880]  show. We're going to Roger Stone with a second update today. As of this morning they attacked
[2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:25.840]  him like seven or eight times. We've got three of the clips. I mean I've said this thing
[2:34:25.840 --> 2:34:29.600]  up one side and down the other, but now we've hit a new level. They called me a Russian
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:34.960]  suge. I've had McClatchy that's a real investigative news journal group out of Florida who does
[2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:41.480]  a lot of good work, which is even crazier. Asking us, what do we know about the Russians?
[2:34:41.480 --> 2:34:47.360]  What are our contacts? Are we basically Russian agents? And do we have bots with the Russians?
[2:34:47.360 --> 2:34:56.440]  Greg Gordon, national correspondent. I mean, we've got like 65 people that work here and
[2:34:56.440 --> 2:35:00.520]  one of them did come over here from Russia because her parents didn't like communism
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:05.480]  and she was in the U.S. Army and is honorably discharged. Is it okay? She's Russian. But
[2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:08.440]  other than that, there's no Russians. I haven't been to Russia or whatever. But I'd love
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:12.680]  that they turn around. Hillary's on the Russian payroll, which they do try to buy people off.
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:18.720]  That's what governments do. She's a communist Chinese agent. She's paid off all this crap.
[2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:26.520]  It was Haiti. And I've got, hi, I've left messages at every contact point I can find.
[2:35:26.520 --> 2:35:29.720]  Could you please put me in touch with the right person to respond to these questions?
[2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:35.040]  Well, here I am. Sources say the FBI let inquiry into Russian meddling in the U.S. election
[2:35:35.040 --> 2:35:39.720]  has been examining whether conservative news sites, including in force, had any contact
[2:35:39.720 --> 2:35:47.360]  with operatives for Russia who engaged in bot attacks that heightened readership of your
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:51.800]  news stories. Do you have any comment? Well, yeah, let me comment. They said during the
[2:35:51.800 --> 2:35:57.920]  election that sites had bots supporting them. And that's how our news was popular. Our news
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:02.080]  was popular because we were the first to break Hillary Clinton falling down. You know, like
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:05.760]  Drudge is the second biggest website in the world, not just news site. Number one news
[2:36:05.760 --> 2:36:10.160]  site, biggest news site in the world. Second biggest because he's been around since like
[2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:16.320]  95. And he breaks a lot of big news. That's why I'm so sick of you acting like we have
[2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:21.040]  giant audiences because we're racist. Like Alec Baldwin said a week and a half ago on
[2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:26.600]  Saturday Night Live, Alex Jones hates black people. What the hell, man? I said, I want
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:29.120]  to punch him in the nose for that. And he was like, he wants to punch him in the nose
[2:36:29.120 --> 2:36:33.960]  for no reason. No, he said, he said playing Donald Trump. I learned black people aren't
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:42.560]  humans from Alex Jones. What the hell? I saw some story about some famous white supremacist.
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:47.240]  I didn't forget his name. It's two days ago with Watson. Watson's always attacking him.
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:52.240]  And it said, oh, in force break up with the KKK. A break up. We were never with him. You
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:58.320]  the Democrats with the KKK. My point is they're going to Roger right now is just they're reaching
[2:36:58.320 --> 2:37:03.680]  next level BS. How the hell do you call up a McClatchy writer and say, no, we haven't
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:09.560]  had contacts with Russians. Oh, well you went on RT. Yeah. And I've been on the BBC. There's
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:14.400]  my Russian connections. I've been on RT probably a hundred times or more. And I'll go on any
[2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:18.000]  channel. This kind of big audience to talk about stuff. I'll go on, you know, Fox News,
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:22.880]  CNN. I mean, I agree with them. This whole ridiculous narrative of the bitching left
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:29.080]  that I'm involved with the Russians or Stone or Trump is, is a joke. Trump just dealt Russia
[2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:33.080]  the biggest blow of any sanctions ever. And he did it because America's first, not because
[2:37:33.080 --> 2:37:37.160]  he hates Russia. He just announced all the colds back on the table. And that's cruise
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:41.360]  all the elites in the Saudis, everybody, too. And it helps the American people. It cuts
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:46.440]  natural gas prices down towards having worth the pop and I'm on the ground. See, I'm geopolitically
[2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:52.520]  involved. I'm informed Greg Gordon. Donald Trump's got every other country and every other
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:58.040]  interest pissed, crapping their drawers because he is gonna have America like a grizzly bear.
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:05.200]  Get up on his hind legs. So everybody better get ready for that. The Russian bear ain't
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:12.720]  got crap on the American bear. Get ready for it. And the American bull, look at the stock
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:18.600]  market, three plus trillion, everything America, America, America's, we got somebody that said
[2:38:18.600 --> 2:38:23.840]  America's open for business and America's the biggest, sexiest thing the world ever
[2:38:23.840 --> 2:38:30.000]  seen. It's Marilyn Monroe, baby, you know, bikini, at her prime, ready to go. We're number
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:35.760]  one again. Get ready for it. David Rockefeller just died. Another beautiful God send that
[2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:40.440]  piece of trash. Great that you into FR country over. So to all of you, let me explain one
[2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:44.560]  damn thing. I'm not gonna sit here and say I'm not some Russian stooge because it's
[2:38:44.560 --> 2:38:49.760]  a GD lie. I'm gonna tell everybody out there though, if I mean this, you say it and I find
[2:38:49.760 --> 2:38:53.080]  you on the street, I'm gonna break your nose. You understand that? Because I've had enough
[2:38:53.080 --> 2:38:59.360]  of your crap. If I'm not America, nothing is. If Donald Trump in America, nothing is.
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:06.520]  If Roger Stone is not America, nothing is. America first. You heard that before? You
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:11.360]  heard a 1776 and let me tell all the Democrats, the globalist something because the thing
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:16.640]  goes on here. Did your news organization employees have communication with the Russian operatives?
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:21.760]  No involved with bots or trolls during the campaign. No. If so, can you describe them?
[2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:26.560]  No dumbass. Have you been contacted by the FBI congressional intelligence committees
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:31.520]  looking into Russian intelligence operations? They need to look into Hillary. No. If so,
[2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:35.920]  can you say when and describe the nature of their inquiries? They want the funding in
[2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:40.040]  shadow government blocking Trump to start surveilling and killing people with hit teams
[2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:44.400]  they insert within these groups. I told you this three months ago, they plan to kill everybody.
[2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:49.240]  Good luck. You guys start pulling your triggers. Just walk on in your huckleberry, fill your
[2:39:49.240 --> 2:39:53.520]  hand because there's the deal. I don't really believe in the Hollywood movies. I am those.
[2:39:53.520 --> 2:39:57.080]  You understand that? So, not worried about Jack. In fact, I just can't wait if you go
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:01.800]  ahead and turn it up. I'm tired of sitting around with you people running your mouths
[2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:08.760]  all day. When you sold out to the chai comms in North Korea, how dare you filth? A message
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:13.680]  I sent earlier via the contact section of info or website might have inadvertently mentioned
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:16.880]  Steve Bennett. Obviously, it was intended for Breitbart. Could you please hook me with
[2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:19.960]  the right person? Greg, I'm sure you might be a good person. I've seen McClatchy actually
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:23.360]  do a lot of good work. Okay. I'm serious. One of the only mainstream stuff I've seen
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:28.800]  is good, but I just, I cannot respond to this. Okay. I cannot respond to asking if I'm a
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:33.680]  child molester. Okay. If I got caught with a dead kid in my truck or something, I could
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:39.760]  see asking the question, dude, dude, America kicked Hillary's ass in the Democrats. Not
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:46.800]  the damn Russians. Can you give me some credit here? We're the big swing and Johnson, bro.
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:52.840]  Not the Russians. Get that to your head. We're back. You understand? Damn you to hell. All
[2:40:52.840 --> 2:40:58.840]  of you. Sorry, Roger. I just, I just, I am getting so sick of this crap. And I'm so sick
[2:40:58.840 --> 2:41:01.560]  of them saying they had communication with you and the Russians. The Trump goes, Oh,
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:05.120]  that's illegal. You just leaked that. They go, Oh, actually, there's no evidence there.
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:09.360]  And we never wiretapped and a bunch of cowards on Capitol Hill kissing ass because they want
[2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:14.280]  to be seen nice by the mainstream media that has no viewers. It was a giant collapsed hoax.
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:17.720]  I want to call them on their hoax and call them on all their crap. And I'm not going
[2:41:17.720 --> 2:41:23.720]  to start a war, but if they want one, let's just get it going. Go ahead. Alex, great to
[2:41:23.720 --> 2:41:29.440]  be with you. Look, it's been quite a morning. I hear you're all over the news as a G D Russian
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:38.000]  agent. Yeah, no, I have seen the hearings this morning. The first, let me say for the
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:44.680]  many people who have contacted me after the hit and run accident of last week, and you
[2:41:44.680 --> 2:41:47.120]  got hit with Palloni and they're trying to kill you out of these hearings. You said that
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:52.520]  months ago, but I'm feeling fine. I still have a bit of a bruise. I am having some blurred
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:59.080]  vision in my right. You had a concussion. The same eye that I had a retinal detachment
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:06.080]  from a boxing mishap a year and a half ago. So in any event, I will be fine. This morning,
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:17.360]  I witnessed the worst kind of mud slinging of red baiting of McCarthyism by a Congressman
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:25.520]  Adam Schiff. His line of questioning was wreck this. It was pejoratively worded and it leaves
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:36.040]  a totally false impression. The inference that my now fully disclosed and benign exchange
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:47.640]  with crucifer 2.0 constitutes collusion in anything is disproved by the content, the
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:51.960]  facts and the timeline. And we know that. But here's the thing. They changed the subject
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:56.400]  from what's in WikiLeaks with all their criminal activity on to us. We're all clamoring like
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:01.320]  the media was for the latest WikiLeaks. Like Como said on CNN, only CNN's allowed to look
[2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:06.080]  at this. You can't know. They look at it. We look at it. I mean, what they just changed
[2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:11.440]  the subject, man. Well, there's there is no question. And Alex, I'm the one whose civil
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:16.800]  rights have been violated. It's you with a visa. I am the one whose privacy rights have
[2:43:16.800 --> 2:43:24.760]  been have been violated. They have systematically leaked this information to the New York Times
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:31.600]  to the smoking gun to a bunch of let's be clear, they take they take massive NSA database
[2:43:31.600 --> 2:43:36.160]  collection of everything you do, find up, find stuff that you've talked to people saying,
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:39.600]  I'm glad you didn't get banned off the Internet or whatever. And then they put it in the newspaper.
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:42.880]  And that's not even an issue when they're admittedly surveilling. Well, and here's the
[2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:48.840]  real irony. They accuse us of utilizing Russian bots. Please give me a break. If one would
[2:43:48.840 --> 2:43:56.120]  simply go online now and do a search under Roger Stone or Alex Jones, but particularly
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:44:04.520]  for some reason, Roger Stone, you'll see a torrent of hate. Kill him decapitated him.
[2:44:04.520 --> 2:44:10.480]  He's a Nazi. He's a bigot. He's going to be perp walk to jail. Well, oh, it's all just
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:17.120]  negative. We'll see how we'll see how this works. I'm going to see if these congressmen
[2:44:17.120 --> 2:44:21.960]  can handle the truth. I demand the opportunity to
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:25.200]  Oh, by the way, they can't really block you. Can they? You should be at the National Press
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:29.280]  Club two days from now that you should go totally ape and you should demand that you
[2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:33.920]  have equal time on every news channel to sit there and take these assholes on. Well, and
[2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:38.720]  John McCain's back in the act again yesterday. He says again, stone must come before the
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:43.160]  Senate to testify. I want to testify. I want to testify. I'll go with you. I hope they
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:49.460]  call me. So, so Senator, you said this a week ago, I published a piece at the Daily Caller
[2:44:49.460 --> 2:44:54.800]  pointing out why that was a reckless and you repeated it again. You've now doubled down.
[2:44:54.800 --> 2:44:59.720]  So here's what I would request. Since you sir are not a member of the Senate Intelligence
[2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:05.880]  Committee, but since any member of the Senate has the right to sit in for that hearing, please
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:15.920]  do the courtesy of to me of sitting in and taking your turn asking questions. I remember
[2:45:15.920 --> 2:45:19.360]  how happy you are on inauguration day that Trump was getting in your big dream is dream
[2:45:19.360 --> 2:45:22.280]  all this. You were the first guy reportedly to mention it to him, but that's admitted
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:27.320]  the news next and said that's a Reagan. You saw the vision and now it's here. And you
[2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:30.520]  also did that 10 minute interview or nine minute interview we did where you said they
[2:45:30.520 --> 2:45:33.920]  said they have the wiretapses have the proof. I was going to talk to Russians release it
[2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:37.440]  right now. Well, then you know, it says actually we looked at it. There's not even phone calls
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:41.200]  with Roger Stoner, Manafort and the Russians. All there is is Flynn. Once he's supposed
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:46.120]  to set up calls for Trump a week before, you know, that 20th article with Rosenberg writing
[2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:50.560]  all these articles. I mean, it's the craziest crap where everything you said came through.
[2:45:50.560 --> 2:45:54.520]  You're like, there's no, there's no calls because I didn't do them. The House Intelligence
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:45:58.320]  Committee says there's no calls with you, but they have a Senate hearing where you're
[2:45:58.320 --> 2:46:04.520]  like the devil. You're exactly right, Alex. I apologize for adjusting my glasses. Frankly,
[2:46:04.520 --> 2:46:11.560]  this is the only thing that temporarily helps on my right. I do have an appointment with
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:17.040]  an eye specialist called Mr. McGear specials. No, these are these are these are kind of
[2:46:17.040 --> 2:46:25.760]  your your minister of truth. I know I'm teasing of great style. Minister of truth thing. No,
[2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:29.440]  but is it surreal for you and your 40 plus years in politics and life? You've been all
[2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:32.560]  of the news many times, many New York Times, you know, articles, dozens of them before
[2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:35.880]  any of this. What is it like to be in the middle of this with them claiming you're a
[2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:40.280]  Russian super spy and the Russians are the reason Trump won all this crap. I mean, the
[2:46:40.280 --> 2:46:43.400]  FBI admitted today, no evidence of them hacking voting machines. We know that was Homeland
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:48.000]  Security for Hillary stealing at least five states trying to sell six others. But I mean,
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:52.360]  just giving mythical. It's very, it's very simple. Alex, I am jonesing for the opportunity
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:58.360]  to correct the historical record. It's not going down this way. This is a fraud. I understand
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:05.120]  that this whole crucifer thing has manipulated to create a headline that says Trump associate
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:12.680]  communicated with Russian hacker. It's not technically true. It's purposely misleading.
[2:47:12.680 --> 2:47:17.400]  Once that is up, you put it up on a bunch of dummy sites, then a bunch of left wing pay
[2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:24.360]  for play fake news sites. You blend in some information that's clearly been leaked by
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:32.040]  the intelligence agencies. George Soros and David Brock and their bots pick up the the
[2:47:32.040 --> 2:47:37.200]  the meme and you're off to the races. They have accused me of being they've accused me
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:45.520]  of treason. But it's the American way to have your right to to face your accuser. I look
[2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:50.520]  forward to that day.
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:54.920]  Roger Stone, I want to play a clip. This is a call me. We didn't do this on purpose. The
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:47:58.080]  clip we found people put a tinfoil hat on his head. But here's the first clip. We've got
[2:47:58.080 --> 2:48:01.440]  two of them where where where you get brought up and he won't say you're not the subject
[2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:04.640]  of investigations. You won't get into the investigation. And I mean, it is just and
[2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:09.480]  now again, McClatchy and others are calling me asking me if I'm a Rusky. I mean, as if
[2:48:09.480 --> 2:48:12.880]  we didn't build in for us as if we don't have a huge audience as if the American people
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:17.520]  didn't win this election, despite everything they did, the collusion, the WikiLeaks. It's
[2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:21.960]  just crazy. We need Trump and others to change the subject back to the real issue. Plus,
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:27.000]  there's the big bombshell on Rudgerport.com and info wars.com that no one's touching.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:32.520]  I'll ask you about that of the clip about him being spied on by the NSA. Absolutely
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:38.160]  incredible. Again, great. Again, oil drops as us drilling grow threatens to counter
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:42.360]  OPEC again. I mean, Trump is just dominating. You want cheap oil? You want cheap gas? You
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:45.320]  want cheap electricity? You want to move to America? You want to, I mean, it's just,
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:48.480]  it's just, it's just doing America's open again. Everybody get out of the way. Here's
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:50.160]  the clip of coming going after Roger Stone.
[2:48:50.160 --> 2:48:54.920]  I just want to follow up with a few questions about Roger Stone that I had started with
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:49:00.800]  earlier before I pass it to my colleagues. Dr. Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:05.440]  played a role on the Trump campaign? I'm not going to talk about any particular person
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:09.880]  here today, Mr. Schiff. I'm going to continue to ask these questions because among other
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:12.880]  things, I want to make sure you are aware of these facts, whether you're able to comment
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:18.840]  on them or not. Have you read press reports where Mr. Stone proudly boasts of engaging
[2:49:18.840 --> 2:49:24.440]  in political dirty tricks? I'll give you the same answer, sir.
[2:49:24.440 --> 2:49:29.000]  I mentioned before that Mr. Stone was in direct communication with the creature of Russian
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:33.360]  GRU, Goose for two, and that's something the intelligence assessment talked about the
[2:49:33.360 --> 2:49:41.280]  role of Goose for two. Mr. Stone on August 17th, where he received the communication
[2:49:41.280 --> 2:49:46.640]  from Goose for two that said, quote, I'm pleased to say that you are great. Please tell me
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:51.120]  if I can help you any how. It would be a great pleasure to me.
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:53.880]  Well, Comey really thinks he's the president from, essentially,
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:49:59.360]  The bureaucracy is so disgusting. Goose for two, Mr. Stone, I have to give you the same
[2:49:59.360 --> 2:50:04.440]  answer. Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly
[2:50:04.440 --> 2:50:08.720]  that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[2:50:08.720 --> 2:50:15.960]  Same answer. He never said that. But I mean, he's on O'Reilly. He's on Sean Hannity. He's
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:22.080]  on CNN. He's on everywhere. I mean, of course, we've tried to get him on. Stone was talking
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:24.800]  to somebody that was going to visit him. That's what you do as a journalist. Hey, you ask
[2:50:24.800 --> 2:50:29.840]  Assange, it's like, we're not supposed to talk to anybody, but all these jerks can because
[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:34.440]  they're got a little bug eyes, little pervert eyes. I hate that Congressman, that Senator.
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:38.520]  Here, let's go back to the club. And also claim that he was in touch with
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:46.400]  an intermediary of Mr. Assange. Same answer. This question, I think you can answer. Do
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:50.760]  you know whether the Russian intelligence services dealt directly with WikiLeaks or
[2:50:50.760 --> 2:50:56.240]  whether they, too, used an intermediary? Yeah, that's right. WikiLeaks never got it
[2:50:56.240 --> 2:51:00.960]  from U.S. intelligence. They never got anything from the DNC. This is how you do lies. See,
[2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:07.760]  the lies, the statement. Russia didn't do anything with WikiLeaks. See how it's lies
[2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:12.320]  upon lies upon lies where they all act all piss. Mr. Schiff, representing the global
[2:51:12.320 --> 2:51:16.080]  is selling America out. Piss, they can't gang rape the country. Piss, they can't get our
[2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:20.920]  guns. Piss, their abortions are in trouble. Piss, their whole program is going up in flames.
[2:51:20.920 --> 2:51:24.240]  And he's up there claiming the Patriots are with the Russians. Give me a break. Let's
[2:51:24.240 --> 2:51:29.960]  go back to this intermediary. We assess they use some kind of cutout. They didn't deal
[2:51:29.960 --> 2:51:40.480]  directly with WikiLeaks in contrast to DC Luke Leaks and Goose for 2.0. In early October,
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:45.080]  are you aware that Mr. Stone tweeted, I have total confidence that my hero, Julian Assange,
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:50.480]  will educate the American people soon? Are you aware of that tweet? I'm back to my original
[2:51:50.480 --> 2:51:51.480]  same answer.
[2:51:51.480 --> 2:51:56.040]  Hey, pause. Assange was in the news saying big stuff coming next week. Remember, he wouldn't
[2:51:56.040 --> 2:51:59.280]  do it and he drug it out over like a month and I was getting pissed at Assange saying
[2:51:59.280 --> 2:52:03.840]  he was like a, you know, the term I use a little bit profane. I mean, they just take
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:07.040]  a knock you with stuff. Let's go back to Roger Stone and we'll finish up with more
[2:52:07.040 --> 2:52:10.560]  of this. I mean, we've got like six or seven of these clips. Now it just goes on on Roger
[2:52:10.560 --> 2:52:14.520]  Stone, Roger Stone. I was on air with you. I was talking to you off air while they were
[2:52:14.520 --> 2:52:19.040]  recording. We now learn all this totally innocuous about, yeah, I'm trying to get all the WikiLeaks.
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:27.920]  You are as if that's some crime, reckless, baseless, the worst. There goes this guy just
[2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:37.960]  playing fast and loose with the truth. I mean, Alex, he claims I had direct that I boasted
[2:52:37.960 --> 2:52:44.480]  of having direct contract with Assange. I didn't. You were always specific, but
[2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:54.040]  who cares if you did? Look, there's only one way to solve this mono a mono. You know,
[2:52:54.040 --> 2:52:57.960]  I feel like so that's why they've been trying to kill you this week and before they don't
[2:52:57.960 --> 2:53:04.920]  want you in the damn hearings. I am the one who civil liberties have been hacked and here
[2:53:04.920 --> 2:53:11.760]  is the problem. The deep state clearly was using surveillance on not only Trump AIDS,
[2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:19.480]  but I believe it will yet be proven on the man himself, both in Trump Tower and in Palm
[2:53:19.480 --> 2:53:26.200]  Beach. Notice as soon as the president exposed that, the intelligence agencies began rapidly
[2:53:26.200 --> 2:53:36.440]  backing off their claim of Russian collusion, looking for some kind of standoff in my opinion.
[2:53:36.440 --> 2:53:43.000]  So we need to find out and establish whether this was done as a FISA court warrant or if
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:53.320]  in fact the Brits did this for Obama to keep it off the books as a cut out, very common
[2:53:53.320 --> 2:54:02.520]  arrangement among the services and are now lying about it, which is what the cut out
[2:54:02.520 --> 2:54:03.520]  is supposed to do.
[2:54:03.520 --> 2:54:06.600]  That's right. They've been caught with their pants down illegally spying. They got nothing
[2:54:06.600 --> 2:54:11.120]  with the spying. So now they're panicking, doubling down, saying there was no spying,
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:15.600]  but they have spying. You're a Russian agent. It's not going to work, Roger Stone.
[2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:22.240]  And I was unaware of allegations that crucifer 2.0 was a Russian asset when I wrote my piece
[2:54:22.240 --> 2:54:28.400]  for Breitbart. Had it been out there in the research, I would have written it. I was unaware
[2:54:28.400 --> 2:54:33.360]  of it when I reached out by the way, you're a journalist writing about leaks. It's about
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:37.280]  the leaks, not who got them. You're doing this in newspapers. They act like when you
[2:54:37.280 --> 2:54:41.680]  mentioned Guccifer, like they found it in some secret deal and you're in some back alley
[2:54:41.680 --> 2:54:44.200]  selling in a nuclear launch codes.
[2:54:44.200 --> 2:54:52.000]  Well, and Mr. Chef, yes, Julian Assange is a hero because he does not work for the Russians.
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:57.320]  Nice try. He does work against the deep state in the globalist.
[2:54:57.320 --> 2:55:01.080]  That is a rogue government that has captured the world and is now being defeated. And as
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:05.440]  each new nation pulls out, Italy, Russia, the UK, it doesn't matter. They claim all
[2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:09.320]  of us got it from the Russians. No, we don't want to be ruled by Goldman Sachs and a bunch
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:13.640]  of globalists that want us to be poor. Got it? We want prosperity and freedom and private
[2:55:13.640 --> 2:55:18.480]  property and family and God and the Second Amendment jerks. That's why we're passed.
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:21.160]  Not because we're Russians. Understand, assholes.
[2:55:21.160 --> 2:55:29.360]  Well, and we're not going down without a fight, not a chance. So this whole Russian thing
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:35.600]  will be exposed. Ultimately, we've seen the part of this. We now know, according to an
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:42.280]  extraordinary piece of research by Dr. Jerry Corsi, that Donald Trump was, in fact, under
[2:55:42.280 --> 2:55:50.480]  surveillance in New York, in Trump Tower, in his palatial New York apartment in Palm Beach
[2:55:50.480 --> 2:55:58.280]  at the Mar-Lago Club, both under Bush and later continued under Obama.
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:02.560]  And it is essential in closing to get that out to the four corners of the planet. It's
[2:56:02.560 --> 2:56:07.320]  on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and drudgereport.com. And look, we're now close to 24 hours
[2:56:07.320 --> 2:56:11.320]  since this was published. Top link on Drudge, no coverage. And we got 60 seconds. What does
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:14.080]  that tell Rodgers-Stone of how scared they are of the story?
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:20.560]  Well, this is the beginning of the surveillance of a future president of the United States.
[2:56:20.560 --> 2:56:27.880]  It comes from a CIA informant, and it also comes through a number of lawsuits filed by
[2:56:27.880 --> 2:56:35.720]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio is not what's important here. He's a fine man. What's important in
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:44.040]  this case is that it provides stone cold truths out of the database that first Bush and Obama
[2:56:44.040 --> 2:56:52.400]  under two different metadata collecting programs were spying on a future president.
[2:56:52.400 --> 2:56:55.280]  And that's Dragnet and Sidewander. Thank you so much, Rodgers-Stone.
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:58.720]  Great to be here, Alex. Wow, what a time to be alive. We're going to take that little
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:01.600]  clip right there for the YouTube video and Facebook, guys. Put that piece right there
[2:57:01.600 --> 2:57:06.480]  on the front. That's powerful. Total info war. My life is so exciting. Whatever happens,
[2:57:06.480 --> 2:57:11.680]  it's God's will. I mean, we're standing up against pure trash. David Knight's coming
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:14.680]  up. I'm going to go to David Rockefeller's death. The North Korea thing I haven't hit
[2:57:14.680 --> 2:57:17.840]  and then turn it over to David Knight. I'm going to host at least 20 minutes of the
[2:57:17.840 --> 2:57:20.800]  next hour and then turn it over to David Knight. Don't worry, David will have his own

[3:00:51.840 --> 3:00:54.680]  coming up in the next segment. And I want to hit some of the North Korea news that haven't
[3:00:54.680 --> 3:01:01.000]  properly covered, which is about as ominous as it gets. But all of us keep getting caught
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:04.560]  up including Roger Stone defending himself because I get it. They don't let him on any
[3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:08.160]  of these national shows hardly, but they just call him a Russian agent with no evidence
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:12.560]  everywhere and then just never let him on. And then they get hit with polonium. They
[3:01:12.560 --> 3:01:16.600]  keep on him. He's a lot worse off that he's even say it on air. He's pretty bad when he
[3:01:16.600 --> 3:01:21.920]  takes the glasses off his eyes or point in the right directions. I don't say that meanly.
[3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:25.880]  It's real sad. They want him dead before they have hearings. Well, they went ahead and still
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:30.560]  have the hearings. He's still alive and they're trying to kill him. The fact I think it was
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:33.560]  good to hear they're going to kill him real soon. They'll set the hearings up and he'll
[3:01:33.560 --> 3:01:37.880]  be poisoned or die. They'll say, Oh, he's an old man. It's no big deal. This is the
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:42.120]  deep state that sold us out to China and others trying to keep control of the country. And
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:45.680]  so all my reporters, myself too, we just keep arguing what they were the New York Times
[3:01:45.680 --> 3:01:49.640]  admitting they wiretapped her. They said they had the communications and Trump pointed out
[3:01:49.640 --> 3:01:53.840]  you just leaked you had those in the press. That's a crime. So they get scared of that.
[3:01:53.840 --> 3:01:57.680]  Get on the offense to change the subject and then say, Oh, but we weren't surveilling we
[3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:01.880]  and then say they never said that we got to play that CNN clip from last week where they
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:07.600]  say it came from me. It came from you. But we just get back to the fact that they did
[3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:11.240]  surveil. They admitted they're surveilled and found nothing. And the committee hearing
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:14.280]  has says that's the case.
[3:02:14.280 --> 3:02:18.440]  We have several clips from the committee hearing. Let's play one of the first ones with Nunez.
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:25.520]  I don't know where my list is of clips saying today that yeah, there's no evidence of any
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:31.000]  Russian contacts or or hacking into the election. We know that how insulting all these foreign
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:35.640]  governments piled on against our election for Hillary. The public saw that rejected
[3:02:35.640 --> 3:02:39.560]  just like Obama and others. And Merkel went to England and said, don't go for the Brexit.
[3:02:39.560 --> 3:02:44.120]  People are sick of this crap that they're the foreign influence. They're the foreign
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:49.120]  outside group. They're the ones doing this, not us. But we just cover it. We keep covering
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:53.400]  myself, including the minutiae of it all. And they know how to just put out a false
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:57.560]  statement, have us respond to their BS. And then they keep doing it and doing it to keep
[3:02:57.560 --> 3:03:02.360]  us off. And I get we have to respond to the BS, but we have to move on because they know
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:07.480]  and we know we're right. We'll obsess on it. We have to move on to you got money from the
[3:03:07.480 --> 3:03:13.000]  Communist Chinese. You sold out to them. Hillary, you sold in the missiles. You gave North Korea
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:19.520]  the reactors. You're the traders. You're the people surveilling the public illegally.
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:24.520]  Now there's a New York Post. You can thank Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton for North Korea
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:29.200]  and nicks. Well, Bill Clinton, really, it's just a fact. I mean, it's there. It's there.
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:33.000]  Go after them. Trump just thinks he can turn the economy back on. They're going to leave
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:37.880]  him alone. No, they're not. Let's go to a clip of them talking about no Russian meddling
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:42.480]  in the physical election, the term hacking the elections. A load of crap. Here it is.
[3:03:42.480 --> 3:03:48.620]  So my question as of today, Admiral Rogers, do you have any evidence that Russia cyber
[3:03:48.620 --> 3:03:51.640]  actors changed both tallies in the state of Michigan?
[3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:56.600]  No, I do not. But I would highlight we're in for an intelligence organization, not a
[3:03:56.600 --> 3:04:01.080]  domestic intelligence organization. Oh, yeah, you never say we're probably not the best
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:06.760]  organization to provide a more complete answer. How about the state of Pennsylvania? No, sir.
[3:04:06.760 --> 3:04:10.640]  The policy of Wisconsin. These guys are all a bunch of political whores that their whole
[3:04:10.640 --> 3:04:14.960]  lives to get these positions of just never shan't for the president, never shan't for
[3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:19.440]  the truth. Just just sit there and just say, but we'd be better off to answer that. No
[3:04:19.440 --> 3:04:25.160]  one has any evidence of any Russian hacking. It's Hillary and the DHS stole five states
[3:04:25.160 --> 3:04:32.000]  hacked into six other states and got caught jerks. They have illegal aliens voting everywhere.
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:36.600]  And they try to tell us that doesn't happen. Well, the Democrats in operation, you know,
[3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:41.160]  battleground Texas organized saying we're going to have the illegals go vote. I'm sick
[3:04:41.160 --> 3:04:47.040]  of the lying arrogance. And all these people were fighting are like piles of dumb garbage.
[3:04:47.040 --> 3:04:52.120]  They're all little simpering crooks. Sick of the filth. I'm sick of the unshilderless
[3:04:52.120 --> 3:04:57.960]  cowards. The age of man is returning. The age of the cowards is ending. Make no mistake.
[3:04:57.960 --> 3:05:07.080]  Robo Bezos. The CIA affiliated owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, donned a robo
[3:05:07.080 --> 3:05:12.000]  suit straight out of Avatar. Bezos hopped in the pilot seat of the 13 foot mobile hunk
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:16.440]  of metal with arms and legs, mimicking those of a humans. He smiled for the cameras and
[3:05:16.440 --> 3:05:21.520]  said with a smile. Bow down before your new king and master. The robot he was operating
[3:05:21.520 --> 3:05:26.320]  is the method two built by the South Korean company, Handcooked Marais. It operates with
[3:05:26.320 --> 3:05:31.240]  two joysticks to control the arms and leg pedals to control the legs. The robot does
[3:05:31.240 --> 3:05:35.600]  still need support in order to stand, essentially still in training wheels. But the giant metal
[3:05:35.600 --> 3:05:39.880]  puppet is certainly turning heads in the tech industry. While it is all fun and games for
[3:05:39.880 --> 3:05:44.760]  now, keep in mind, robot police are now a reality with more law enforcement, including
[3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:49.880]  in the U S looking to robot police in the future. The military has also said it wants to move
[3:05:49.880 --> 3:05:56.480]  away from humans and more towards robots. Is the robo arms race on for info wars.com?
[3:05:56.480 --> 3:06:00.320]  This is Owen Troyer.
[3:06:00.320 --> 3:06:04.840]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the
[3:06:04.840 --> 3:06:09.320]  best new off the grid products of 2017. And seriously, I really think everyone should
[3:06:09.320 --> 3:06:13.240]  have one of these. I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at
[3:06:13.240 --> 3:06:17.680]  Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors. The PPX is so small, you can put
[3:06:17.680 --> 3:06:22.240]  it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like
[3:06:22.240 --> 3:06:26.280]  a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling. Plus, you can take it with you to
[3:06:26.280 --> 3:06:31.060]  jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18 wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes. The system
[3:06:31.060 --> 3:06:34.760]  provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity, allowing you to create your own
[3:06:34.760 --> 3:06:40.160]  private power grid, literally anywhere in the world. Perfect for cabins, remote locations,
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:44.760]  any time you need to get off the grid for a while. Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch
[3:06:44.760 --> 3:06:50.920]  this thing in action. That's privatepowergrid.com. Even better, use coupon code private at checkout

[3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:06.840]  party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family. I take this, my
[3:07:06.840 --> 3:07:11.360]  family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information
[3:07:11.360 --> 3:07:15.040]  you're going to find anywhere. So what you find in our news is the same thing you find

[3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:24.600]  noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that
[3:07:24.600 --> 3:07:29.280]  was life changing for me. Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female. I had
[3:07:29.280 --> 3:07:35.240]  a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very
[3:07:35.240 --> 3:07:41.600]  exciting, feeling great, looking good. And I know my hair is luxurious once again. So
[3:07:41.600 --> 3:07:47.200]  obviously the super female is amazing. I love it. Nascent iodine is essential. Survival
[3:07:47.200 --> 3:07:50.880]  Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest
[3:07:50.880 --> 3:07:56.880]  it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2. It's got a five star rating. It's a win-win
[3:07:56.880 --> 3:08:08.720]  at InfoWarsLife.com.
[3:08:08.720 --> 3:08:11.880]  The answer to charity is liberty.
[3:08:11.880 --> 3:08:27.400]  I don't know how this is going to end, but they want to fight. They better believe they've
[3:08:27.400 --> 3:08:33.760]  got one. That's the key to this. These type of criminals, the more you roll over, the
[3:08:33.760 --> 3:08:37.600]  worse it gets. We're just going to fight. Not going to worry about how this ends or
[3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:43.200]  where this is going. I've got to tell you though, my soul loves it. It's the opposite
[3:08:43.200 --> 3:08:50.040]  of fear. The loved ones want to break the law and bring in charity. We're going to
[3:08:50.040 --> 3:08:54.880]  break them. David Knight's coming up in just about 12 minutes. I've got a lot of clips
[3:08:54.880 --> 3:09:00.760]  to get to here in a short time to get there. I should add that I never knew this would
[3:09:00.760 --> 3:09:04.920]  be such a popular product when I had an idea it would be Made in America, Organic, High
[3:09:04.920 --> 3:09:15.440]  Quality, Non-GMO, Non-Fluoride, with iodine, with the colloidal silver, Super Blue, InfoWarsLife,
[3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:18.960]  sold out last time, the first shipment in three days. The second shipment was twice
[3:09:18.960 --> 3:09:28.600]  as big, 12 days. The tubes are the issue. The tubes are the issue. We're having trouble
[3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:32.360]  getting the tubes. We have to change the tubes. We only got an unlimited amount of the tubes.
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:38.480]  The new stuff coming out maybe in a different tube. This is a limited run available at infowarslives.com
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:44.840]  or call toll 3-888-2533-139. I've got it discounted out of the gates. It's as low as $8 a tube
[3:09:44.840 --> 3:09:48.760]  at infowarsstore.com. We make like four or five bucks to help fund the operation. Thank
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:53.400]  you all for your support today. We're certainly under globalist attack. Your purchases help
[3:09:53.400 --> 3:09:57.880]  fund this whole operation. You're who sponsors. Not George Soros, not David Rockefeller. You
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:02.600]  name it. Okay. I don't want to cut this clip off. So here is Nunes. He's been pretty good
[3:10:02.600 --> 3:10:07.480]  actually in the house. He said a month ago and two weeks ago and yesterday, we've looked
[3:10:07.480 --> 3:10:11.840]  at all the files. There's not even phone calls with Roger Stone and Manaford to Russians.
[3:10:11.840 --> 3:10:17.480]  There is with Flynn when he's the national security advisor incoming and the transcripts
[3:10:17.480 --> 3:10:22.560]  to that are illegal. They had to unmask him with the computer programs or keywords, which
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:28.720]  recording it with keywords. That's what Google is, just a database of words that are said.
[3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:33.000]  That's what Google was. It was an NSA echelon program that's 30 years old. They've got more
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:36.880]  update stuff, but you're supposed to mask, you know, General Michael T. Flynn or whatever.
[3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:40.560]  They don't do that. They illegally took that off, gave it to the media. You go, look, he
[3:10:40.560 --> 3:10:45.680]  talked to the Russians. Well, he publicly said he was lining up calls to Trump. He talked
[3:10:45.680 --> 3:10:49.520]  to the Turks. Everybody else. That's what Flynn's working hard for this country. I mean, Flynn's
[3:10:49.520 --> 3:10:54.920]  like loved the military is totally kicking ass. It's like Trump just restored our coal,
[3:10:54.920 --> 3:11:00.600]  folks. Russia and all these other countries don't have big coal exports we do, or they
[3:11:00.600 --> 3:11:05.520]  export natural gas. That devastates Russia. We don't want to devastate Russia, but sorry,
[3:11:05.520 --> 3:11:10.800]  America's going to have cheap power again. Everything Trump's doing is absolutely, quite
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:14.560]  frankly, undercutting other countries. Now, they want to trade deals with us. They can,
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:19.840]  but that's why the economy's turning back on folks. Trump is representing us. That's
[3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:25.680]  how you prove it. It's like Horton has a who, you know, the Maisie bird doesn't sit with
[3:11:25.680 --> 3:11:31.360]  the egg. So when it hatches, it's a baby elephant. You know, Horton has a who Dr. Seuss. I'm
[3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:34.160]  not saying that's real. The media will say I'm being real. No, it's, it's an allegory.
[3:11:34.160 --> 3:11:38.280]  It's a parallel. I mean, you know, America's reborn. It hatches out. It looks like Donald
[3:11:38.280 --> 3:11:43.160]  Trump's got, you know, gold hair and we'll look. I mean, it's, it's just crazy. So we're
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:48.120]  going to get to this clip. We're dead. Rockefeller dying in a moment, but here, briefly, here
[3:11:48.120 --> 3:11:54.200]  is the clip we didn't finish up with the NSA director being talked to by newness.
[3:11:54.200 --> 3:12:00.800]  So my question as of today, Adam Rogers, do you have any evidence that Russia cyber actors
[3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:06.160]  changed vote tallies in the state of Michigan? No, I do not. But I would highlight we're
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:10.360]  in foreign intelligence organization, not a domestic intelligence. Oh yeah. You've never
[3:12:10.360 --> 3:12:14.800]  watched anything here. You've never watched foreign groups come in the U.S. Lie.
[3:12:14.800 --> 3:12:20.840]  Answer. How about the state of Pennsylvania? No, sir. The state of Wisconsin? No, sir.
[3:12:20.840 --> 3:12:27.840]  State of Florida? No, sir. State of North Carolina? No, sir. State of Ohio? No, sir.
[3:12:27.840 --> 3:12:33.320]  So you have no intelligence that suggests or evidence that suggests any votes were changed.
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:37.320]  I've nothing generated by the national security agency, sir. Director Comey, do you have
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:41.880]  any evidence at the FBI that any votes were changed in the states that I mentioned to
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:48.000]  Adam Rogers? No. Thank you. There are still in the news saying that happened when Hillary
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:51.000]  got caught. What do you do when you get caught and you lose? You go say that the group did
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:55.400]  it. Here's another clip where they talk about unmasking the names because that's what Trump
[3:12:55.400 --> 3:12:59.600]  said. You're listening to us and you're giving us the media. That's illegal. What on earth
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:04.040]  are you doing? You give it to the Justice Department or the Senate Armed Services Committee
[3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:11.040]  or the Intelligence Committee. You don't give it to the media and they went, oh, yeah, we've
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:14.040]  got the recordings. Oh, actually, we never did that. You're crazy. We never said that,
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:19.200]  hoping you don't remember a month and a half ago. Again, I keep harping on that is that
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:26.040]  it's just crazy that they do that. Now, let's shift gears. David Rockefeller died yesterday
[3:13:26.040 --> 3:13:31.480]  at 101 and he had always said that no one in his family lived past 100. So he broke the
[3:13:31.480 --> 3:13:36.600]  family record. Well, like John D. the first died at 99 and all like two days before or
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:41.200]  whatever. I mean, that's in the family lore of this very parasitic, clearly genetic psychopathic
[3:13:41.200 --> 3:13:46.000]  family. A lot of people can pass on psychopathic or at least sociopathic traits that's been
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:50.200]  proven. Globalism Rockefeller dead at 101. The whole world government project with the
[3:13:50.200 --> 3:13:55.480]  British, the whole new world order, the land, the Rockefeller Plaza, let the UN be built
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:14:00.040]  on. The 100 plus globalist organizations, they founded almost all of them. Bilderberg
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:04.800]  founded in 1954 in Usherbeck, Holland. I mean, it's just figurative as Trump's in and all
[3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:12.040]  this is happening that this guy died. A few years ago, 2012, we did a mock funeral for
[3:14:12.040 --> 3:14:16.160]  not not wishing him to die because he's evil. Obviously lives on as institutions like the
[3:14:16.160 --> 3:14:22.320]  Ring of Mordor. But just a mock funeral joke for the YouTube clip on info wars.com, the
[3:14:22.320 --> 3:14:28.120]  you know, mock deathbed confession of David Rockefeller. And it's a scene from the dark
[3:14:28.120 --> 3:14:31.080]  crystal with the Skexies when there's when the emperor is about to die and they're about
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:35.280]  to pass the power on. But you can believe that already happened a few years ago and
[3:14:35.280 --> 3:14:40.760]  his, his nephew, the Senator Rockefeller didn't want the power. He's kind of scurried off.
[3:14:40.760 --> 3:14:49.080]  It's a high workload. And I'm telling you, it's, it's, it's now Bill Gates, Warren Buffett
[3:14:49.080 --> 3:14:54.400]  and people like, of course, our good friend, George Soros. They're the front guys. There's
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:57.960]  a lot of old money behind them, but they're, they're, they're field marshals in the fight
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:03.320]  against humanity. And a guy that whose father funded that off Hitler, who was in Germany,
[3:15:03.320 --> 3:15:07.840]  helping put Hitler in power as a young man in college in Germany, IBM, Hold Hill, you
[3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:11.320]  want to know who runs your life, but fluoride in your water, cancer viruses, your vaccines
[3:15:11.320 --> 3:15:16.080]  and, and, and brags about his memoirs, how he wants world government wants to reduce
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:23.480]  your population, make you poor. That's him. Probably too old for the brain transplant.
[3:15:23.480 --> 3:15:28.720]  Is he really dead? You think? Who knows with these people, but they got advanced technologies,
[3:15:28.720 --> 3:15:32.920]  but probably not that advanced. Right? I mean, we know they're going for him. So for
[3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:38.080]  a little fun, it's more powerful of your TV viewer, info wars.com, forward slash show.
[3:15:38.080 --> 3:15:45.280]  Here is the deathbed event and deathbed footage of David Rockefeller dying yesterday. David
[3:15:45.280 --> 3:15:49.400]  Rockefeller, global central banker, advocated new world order and mass population control
[3:15:49.400 --> 3:15:54.640]  while wielding evasive wants over world leaders died Monday at the age of 101. Family Spokesmanship,
[3:15:54.640 --> 3:15:58.560]  a Frieser piece said to confirmed his passing Rockefeller, who was well known for openly
[3:15:58.560 --> 3:16:02.160]  bragging about transnational elites, plans to centralize control of the world's population's
[3:16:02.160 --> 3:16:07.960]  wealth and resources. And so it goes on from there. So here under satire, not real news,
[3:16:07.960 --> 3:16:14.960]  I'll probably claim I'm being serious here, is him making the jump into hyperspace. We
[3:16:14.960 --> 3:16:23.840]  don't know what destination. Here it is. Creeping along at the Rockefeller command base. Oprah
[3:16:23.840 --> 3:16:27.720]  Winfrey does attend secret meetings with him, ABC News discuss world government and forced
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:35.960]  population reduction. So we've got, we've got Brzezinski and George Soros walking up
[3:16:35.960 --> 3:16:50.960]  the hall, facing each other off about who gets the separate.
[3:16:50.960 --> 3:17:01.960]  Quiet! Quiet! The elites are exactly like this bunch of arrogant scum. Ellen, all right,
[3:17:01.960 --> 3:17:21.040]  she looks like a skeptic. They go around the throne. Not dead yet. There's the beautiful
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:39.000]  David Rockefeller. He reaches for the scepter. Mine. My country. I'll rob you blind America.
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:58.560]  I'll teach you questions. Better fingers. I'm not the threat. Trump is. David Rockefeller
[3:17:58.560 --> 3:18:08.760]  101 total global government collapsing before his eyes. I didn't want to live to see
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:12.920]  David Rockefeller six feet under. Not in a mean way. In a loving way. They call the
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:20.960]  vaccines. And here's all his work. His whole world government falls to dust on sand castles
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:35.760]  at the beach. Yes, castles will crumble eventually into the sea. There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:18:35.760 --> 3:18:43.200]  That is the death of David Rockefeller. Televised live at infowars.com transmitted worldwide.
[3:18:43.200 --> 3:18:46.400]  He wrote in New York Times when Mao Zedong died that he did a great job in China and
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:49.200]  he hoped for that here in America. So he's a guy that supported somebody that killed
[3:18:49.200 --> 3:18:55.280]  80 plus million Chinese. So I think I can make fun of him dying. What do you think? Right?
[3:18:55.280 --> 3:18:59.840]  I'm sure there'll be some articles about that, but nothing about the admissions. And I hope
[3:18:59.840 --> 3:19:05.840]  that when John McAfee comes on here in a minute with David Knight, literally in about 60 seconds,
[3:19:05.840 --> 3:19:10.960]  I hope that we'll bring up to him the story on infowars.com and drugreport.com that almost
[3:19:10.960 --> 3:19:16.800]  24 hours into no one has covered. Yeah, there's a quote. Whatever the price of the Chinese
[3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:20.920]  Revolution has obviously succeeded not only in producing a more efficient and dedicated
[3:19:20.920 --> 3:19:24.800]  administration, but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose. Yeah, we'll
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:28.800]  kill you as if you don't. The social experiment, Senator Chairman Mao's leadership, one of
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:33.440]  the most important and successful in human history. That was after much of the New York
[3:19:33.440 --> 3:19:37.960]  Times. I went and got off the microfilm to my film Endgame, actual us at the UT library
[3:19:37.960 --> 3:19:44.560]  showing it on the microfishing. The folks used to deny that quote was real. They admitted
[3:19:44.560 --> 3:19:48.960]  the giant great leap forward, close revolution were the biggest disasters in human history,
[3:19:48.960 --> 3:19:56.360]  killed 84 million Chinese, but not according to David Rockefeller. So old David has made
[3:19:56.360 --> 3:20:01.360]  the jump into a hyperspace. And I see that we have John McAfee over there right now
[3:20:01.360 --> 3:20:06.520]  with David. Now, are they ready for me to go to them? Are they still fiddle frapping
[3:20:06.520 --> 3:20:09.680]  around with it? And Skype's great, but sometimes you have your problems, obviously. So we're
[3:20:09.680 --> 3:20:14.000]  gonna have a big TV network here, but not have our guests be it. You go to TV studios.
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:21.080]  That would bankrupt us. We try to do that. So I can't describe the listeners how big
[3:20:21.080 --> 3:20:24.680]  it is and how important it is. I know, you know, the NSA was spying on Trump. I know
[3:20:24.680 --> 3:20:30.200]  you saw them in the newspapers saying they were spying on Trump. You saw that. And then
[3:20:30.200 --> 3:20:39.200]  now they said they weren't spying on Trump. But now we need to get the article out where
[3:20:39.200 --> 3:20:43.760]  we have NSA documents, which are clearly real. It's got phone numbers I never put out, all
[3:20:43.760 --> 3:20:48.560]  sorts of stuff. Trump's phone numbers that I've got, it's him. This came out in federal
[3:20:48.560 --> 3:20:54.280]  cases, basically CIA contractor. And all this is going on. It's a new Snowden, the headline
[3:20:54.280 --> 3:21:01.240]  is New Snowden. Exposes massive Obama NSA spying on Trump. Also on Sheriff Arpaio and
[3:21:01.240 --> 3:21:07.720]  his court case. So it's at infowars.com. And most importantly, they're trying to block
[3:21:07.720 --> 3:21:11.160]  us on Facebook, Google, Twitter, everywhere. More than ever, you've got to send links via
[3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:16.720]  email. You've got to contact friends and family neighbors. They don't want you visiting infowars.com,
[3:21:16.720 --> 3:21:21.080]  prisonplanet.com, drudgereport.com. And they're openly trying to wrangle and set up a whole
[3:21:21.080 --> 3:21:28.440]  system where this happens. All right, I'm going to go ahead and hand the baton over
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:32.800]  to David Knight to host the rest of the transmission. I want to thank all the viewers for their
[3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:38.560]  support. And he's got, of course, McAfee of hacking fame to break all this down straight
[3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:42.880]  ahead. And then the nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central, but just the sleeping
[3:21:42.880 --> 3:21:47.040]  giant that was awake under Trump's, you know, run is somewhat awake now, but needs to get
[3:21:47.040 --> 3:21:51.400]  really awake because all hands on deck. This is the fight. Thank you all for your support.
[3:21:51.400 --> 3:21:54.000]  Now for the rest of the transmission with David Knight.
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:58.440]  Thank you, Alex. And you know, we have this situation where we've got the most successful
[3:21:58.440 --> 3:22:03.600]  person who is iconic in terms of anti hacking, John McAfee. Everybody that's got a computer
[3:22:03.600 --> 3:22:08.680]  has got his antivirus software. I thought it'd be great to have him comment on vault
[3:22:08.680 --> 3:22:13.920]  seven in general. But of course, today we've had the dog and pony show of FBI director
[3:22:13.920 --> 3:22:20.280]  Comey. So I think it's interesting to contrast the cold water that FBI director Comey is
[3:22:20.280 --> 3:22:24.920]  pouring on the idea that anybody would be wiretapping a person of interest like Donald
[3:22:24.920 --> 3:22:25.920]  Trump.
[3:22:25.920 --> 3:22:29.560]  At the same time saying, oh, we really are doing an investigation of this red herring
[3:22:29.560 --> 3:22:33.880]  story that the Russians hacked our election. And then we had Nunez go through there. Well,
[3:22:33.880 --> 3:22:37.280]  did they get into this? Did they get into that state, that state, that state? Of course
[3:22:37.280 --> 3:22:41.800]  they didn't. But we do know that the Department of Homeland Security hacked into state board
[3:22:41.800 --> 3:22:47.200]  of elections. Imagine if it came out that Russia had done what our own Homeland Security
[3:22:47.200 --> 3:22:48.200]  did.
[3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:51.120]  But we have to pretend that our government is not listening to us. In spite of the
[3:22:51.120 --> 3:22:55.200]  documentary evidence, we have to pretend that they have no interest in hacking the election.
[3:22:55.200 --> 3:23:01.120]  So I want to go to John McAfee, get his take and have him try to educate the public somewhat
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:04.600]  more on vault seven. Thank you for joining us, John McAfee.
[3:23:04.600 --> 3:23:08.320]  It was good to be on.
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:09.320]  Thank you, John.
[3:23:09.320 --> 3:23:17.880]  And now let's start by saying the inability. It's absolutely, by the way, impossible to
[3:23:17.880 --> 3:23:25.200]  determine the source of a hack if the hacker is even remotely sophisticated. Because look
[3:23:25.200 --> 3:23:30.720]  at the hackers we do catch. They're teenage boys like the 15-year-old who hacked into
[3:23:30.720 --> 3:23:37.720]  the FBI, stole every name, address, phone number, photograph, fingerprints, and social
[3:23:37.720 --> 3:23:46.000]  security number of every undercover agent in the FBI and published it on the dark web.
[3:23:46.000 --> 3:23:51.840]  Now, what was the FBI's response? Instead of going, oh my God, we're incompetent, they
[3:23:51.840 --> 3:23:58.360]  go, hey, we caught the kid. Well, of course you caught him. He's 15. Please try to catch
[3:23:58.360 --> 3:24:06.520]  a 35-year-old seriously dedicated hacker. Try to catch an entire hacking organization
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:12.160]  like the mafia of hackers in Russia that are doing all the ransomware. No, you're not
[3:24:12.160 --> 3:24:15.280]  going to do that because anybody can hide their tracks.
[3:24:15.280 --> 3:24:19.520]  Absolutely. We've had this discussion before with you. You've been on before when this
[3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:25.400]  began months ago. We had you on and you were talking about the fact that they could very
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:29.480]  easily cover their tracks. They said, well, we've got some indication that indicates
[3:24:29.480 --> 3:24:34.960]  that it might be done by a Russian-language individual. But of course, as we talked about
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:40.560]  months ago, you and I, anybody worth their salt would either, first of all, not leave
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:44.200]  those fingerprints or they would put false fingerprints to incriminate somebody else.
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:49.840]  But now we've had Vault 7 showing the documents of how they do it in addition to your expertise.
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:56.480]  They said, this is how we do it. And they go, we changed the compiler times. We put,
[3:24:56.480 --> 3:25:02.000]  if we want to make it look like the Russians, we use a Cyrillic keyboard, the Russian language,
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:06.480]  Russian hacking techniques. We'll find an old Russian state program, which is in the
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:13.200]  public domain, and we'll use that. Please. So I've been saying this for years. You simply
[3:25:13.200 --> 3:25:20.680]  can't find the source of an attack. And the CIA said the same thing. So yet our FBI is
[3:25:20.680 --> 3:25:27.400]  going, yes, the Russians hacked Yahoo. Yes, they hacked the DNC. Well, I don't know about
[3:25:27.400 --> 3:25:33.440]  the Yahoo. I find it extraordinarily unlikely. But I do know about the DNC. It could not
[3:25:33.440 --> 3:25:39.600]  have been the Russians because they used a program that was one and a half years old
[3:25:39.600 --> 3:25:46.320]  and had not bothered to keep it updated. Please. If you're a Russian state hacker and you did
[3:25:46.320 --> 3:25:51.440]  that, they would schedule you for suicide the next morning. So you know they don't do
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:52.440]  stupid things.
[3:25:52.440 --> 3:25:58.040]  Yeah, absolutely. And that is a very important point. The fact that the software that was
[3:25:58.040 --> 3:26:02.000]  actually used was an out-of-date version of something that was essentially the public
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:03.000]  domain.
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:10.240]  But I want you to comment, John, on Vault 7, because now we have thousands of pieces
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:14.360]  of hacking software that were commissioned by the CIA. And of course, we had Aaron Schwartz
[3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:20.120]  tell us years ago when he was talking about SOPA, ACTA, PIPA, SISPA, all those different
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:24.360]  things, trying to fight that new level of government surveillance, where they would
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:29.360]  then give immunity to the corporations who collect all this information on us. He said
[3:26:29.360 --> 3:26:35.200]  at the time that it was the US government that was funding and creating these exploits.
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:38.840]  And now we see that with Vault 7, but they pretend that doesn't happen as this was coming
[3:26:38.840 --> 3:26:45.520]  out. We had Stephen Colbert mocking the very idea that they would use the Internet of Things
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:50.360]  to spy on you through appliances. Remember that? We had that admission five years to
[3:26:50.360 --> 3:26:54.560]  the day earlier. David portrayed it as saying, we're going to use all your appliances to
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:26:55.800]  listen to you.
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:26:59.600]  And yet when Kellyanne Conway points that out, it's like, you do know, of course, that
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:04.240]  they are listening to us through our televisions, our phones, and all of our appliances. They
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:10.360]  are rolling on the floor laughing with Stephen Colbert in the late show as if that didn't
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:11.360]  exist.
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:16.880]  Is this an intelligence operation in the comedy sense or what? I mean, this is absolutely
[3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:21.640]  unbelievable that they would think the American public is so stupid, has such a short attention
[3:27:21.640 --> 3:27:22.640]  span.
[3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:30.880]  Well, unfortunately, some of us are. Because what happens is 90% of the people get their
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:38.640]  facts, their truth from the mainstream media, which has become a reality show. And so any
[3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:47.720]  politically motivated happening, which is titillating or exciting or makes us angry,
[3:27:47.720 --> 3:27:51.280]  like we're all going to be angry at the Russians. Well, the mainstream media is going to make
[3:27:51.280 --> 3:27:53.880]  out what they want.
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:28:02.360]  But the CIA admitted, here's the horror of Vault 17. The horror is they kept these exploits
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:09.600]  from the very industries that they had used to exploit, including Microsoft, Google, Apple,
[3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:14.680]  all of our software industries. And even if they didn't create them when they discovered
[3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:20.800]  that other hackers had created them, do you know what they did? Not a thing.
[3:28:20.800 --> 3:28:21.800]  That's right.
[3:28:21.800 --> 3:28:22.800]  That's right.
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:30.160]  You realize that costs Americans billions of dollars and put us at risk at serious risk.
[3:28:30.160 --> 3:28:35.400]  It's unconscionable. It's like keeping a boatload of penicillin out of the hands of
[3:28:35.400 --> 3:28:40.800]  sick people because you're afraid that the enemy may get their hands on it.
[3:28:40.800 --> 3:28:44.640]  And let's underscore that. They go out and they create these burglary tools. This is
[3:28:44.640 --> 3:28:50.560]  cyber burglary. They go out and find and create these tools. When they lose the tools and
[3:28:50.560 --> 3:28:56.000]  they're out there, and of course, the community that would do this sort of thing is very well
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:29:00.560]  known to them. They do not let anyone know. They continue to leave this out there. And
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:05.080]  I think it's very interesting, John, the fact that there's not going to be these things
[3:29:05.080 --> 3:29:07.920]  can't be copyrighted. They didn't want to copyright them because I didn't want to let
[3:29:07.920 --> 3:29:09.160]  people know that they existed.
[3:29:09.160 --> 3:29:14.280]  But they also didn't classify them because if they classified these exploits, then when
[3:29:14.280 --> 3:29:20.000]  the CIA spread them around putting them on people's computers, they would be liable for
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:25.240]  charges of violating national security by putting national security information out there.
[3:29:25.240 --> 3:29:29.520]  We got to take a break. We're going to come right back with John McAfee, the guy who made
[3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:35.720]  a fortune producing anti-hacking software. What does he think about Vault 7 and what
[3:29:35.720 --> 3:29:49.040]  the CIA has done? We'll be right back with John McAfee.
[3:29:49.040 --> 3:29:59.760]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:59.760 --> 3:30:04.040]  The House Intelligence Committee hearing today on Russia and the 2016 elections has been
[3:30:04.040 --> 3:30:09.160]  quite the fake news anti-Trump double standard ceremony. Led by the anti-Trump team of Schiff,
[3:30:09.160 --> 3:30:14.480]  Comey and Nunez, the 2020 Globalist Democrat campaign for U.S. President has begun. Admiral
[3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:19.000]  Rogers of the NSA could not answer many questions due to national security and classified information
[3:30:19.000 --> 3:30:23.320]  – the hearing was loaded with canned questions, responses, and lawyer talk. The Trump-Russian
[3:30:23.320 --> 3:30:27.600]  narrative echoed with, there was no wiretapping, attacks peppered in.
[3:30:27.600 --> 3:30:31.400]  So now, U.S. officials are discussing the investigation of Russian influence on the
[3:30:31.400 --> 3:30:36.160]  Trump campaign and the election, but at the same time attacking Trump for claiming he
[3:30:36.160 --> 3:30:42.000]  was being investigated by the U.S. government during these investigations. 1984 double think
[3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:46.400]  in the flesh. Understand this, this hearing and all other related hearings or narratives
[3:30:46.400 --> 3:30:50.960]  are nothing more than the Globalist Democrat U.S. Presidential Campaign for 2020. They
[3:30:50.960 --> 3:30:55.440]  will try to delegitimize President Trump with fake news, then attack him on it the entire
[3:30:55.440 --> 3:31:25.400]  2020 campaign. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.

[3:33:38.680 --> 3:33:53.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're going to be talking to John McAfee, the man who made a fortune protecting us from hackers, but who protects us from the CIA, the people who have funded all these exploits.
[3:33:53.680 --> 3:34:06.680]  Remember, and of course, this is according to WikiLeaks in Vault 7. They say that by the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division had over 5,000 registered users, had produced more than 1,000 hacking systems.
[3:34:06.680 --> 3:34:16.680]  Trojans. Viruses. Other weaponized malware. Techniques allow the CIA to bypass encryption of, and listen to these apps in case you use some of them.
[3:34:16.680 --> 3:34:28.680]  WhatsApp. Signal. Telegram. Weibo. Confide. Cloakman. What they would do is hack your smartphone and grab this information even before it was encrypted.
[3:34:28.680 --> 3:34:36.680]  Then they let all this stuff go. It's out in the public domain and they don't warn anybody about this because they want to keep this secret.
[3:34:36.680 --> 3:34:48.680]  So when you talk about white hat hackers and you talk about black hat hackers, you can say that the CIA is definitely on the black hat side, even though they knew this stuff was gone, they didn't warn anybody.
[3:34:48.680 --> 3:34:57.680]  So now we've got WikiLeaks working with these different companies telling them what these exploits are, giving them the information that the CIA would not do.
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:35:09.680]  When you are told that you need to sacrifice your liberty and they promise they're going to make you more secure, they're going to make you more safe, I hope you remember what the CIA has done with this.
[3:35:09.680 --> 3:35:21.680]  Not only did they fund these exploits, and remember going back to what Aaron Schwartz said, he said years ago, before he died, before I believe they killed him, he said the government is funding the creation of vulnerabilities.
[3:35:21.680 --> 3:35:27.680]  These are offering rewards for people to find and build vulnerabilities into the system and give it to the US government.
[3:35:27.680 --> 3:35:32.680]  And then of course, when that leaks out, the US government doesn't care about your security.
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:48.680]  Think of all the mischief that a criminal, just an individual criminal, could do with your accounts using these hacks that the CIA created, funded, archived, and then lost and told no one about it.
[3:35:48.680 --> 3:35:52.680]  So that's the way they keep you safe, folks. That's the way they keep you safe.
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:35:57.680]  When you give up your liberty, when you give up your security, when you let them do dragnet surveillance.
[3:35:57.680 --> 3:36:07.680]  And of course, all of the hearing that we heard today, talking about how this was totally laughable, that anybody would wiretap Donald Trump.
[3:36:07.680 --> 3:36:13.680]  And of course, no president would do this. Let me just read you a couple of quotes that came out today from FBI Director Comey.
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:20.680]  He said, John McAfee's comments on this. Comey said, there is no information to support Trump's tweets that he was wiretapped.
[3:36:20.680 --> 3:36:28.680]  Comey said, no president could order such surveillance. Well, what he left out of there was no president could legally order such surveillance.
[3:36:28.680 --> 3:36:31.680]  But of course, we have a government now that doesn't care about legality.
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:42.680]  Then he said, they're investigating Trump and the Russian collusion, but they're not investigating the US intelligence and their collusion with those who want to oppose Donald Trump.
[3:36:42.680 --> 3:36:48.680]  He said that the Russians were successful. He actually said the Russians were successful in manipulating our elections.
[3:36:48.680 --> 3:36:55.680]  He said they introduced chaos and discord into our elections and they will be back in 2018-2020.
[3:36:55.680 --> 3:37:03.680]  John McAfee, do you really think that the American people were polled by the Russians? Do you think that they hacked our elections?
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:08.680]  Of course, they use that word hacking to imply that they got in and electronically flipped votes.
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:19.680]  And that's one of the reasons why Congressman Nunez went through the list of states with both the FBI director and with Admiral Rogers saying, did they get into the elections in this state, in this state, in this state?
[3:37:19.680 --> 3:37:29.680]  Of course, they didn't, but they imply that's what they did because they want to interject the government's homeland security into our electronic voting machines, don't they?
[3:37:29.680 --> 3:37:47.680]  Well, the first comment, you started off by saying that in Vault 7, the CIA said that they had techniques of bypassing WhatsApp, signal, and every other encrypted program.
[3:37:47.680 --> 3:37:57.680]  Yes, they do. And they do it using a technique called keystroke logging. It's the oldest and simplest hacking technique in the world.
[3:37:57.680 --> 3:38:15.680]  And I'm going to say something that might frighten a few of you, if anybody watching this program has ever gone to a pornography site and actually looked at the video, you have a keystroke logger on your phone.
[3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:29.680]  The porn sites sell all of this information to Russian, Chinese, and Ukrainian and other hackers around the world so that they can sell you stuff. The porn site is free. Nothing is free in life.
[3:38:29.680 --> 3:38:43.680]  Anyway, if you've visited a single one, whether it's Exams or Pornhub or anywhere else, you have a keystroke logger and people have been watching everything that you've typed since you've visited that porn site.
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:39:00.680]  And you can't get rid of it. You're going to have to do a factory reset of your phone. And it's not just porn sites. It's any of these websites that offer you something which is spectacular, but it's free or almost free or way cheaper than it should be.
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:09.680]  Well, don't go visit that site because there's something wrong with that. I'm sorry. The world does not work that way. So I'm sorry to digress.
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:21.680]  But it's also one of the reasons why you get so much spam. You could just go to a site where they're trying to sell you soap and then all of a sudden you start getting spam about not only soap but about everything in the world because they've collected your information and turned it over.
[3:39:21.680 --> 3:39:30.680]  And of course, John, what the federal government has done is all this information is being collected out there surreptitiously or with so-called free sites.
[3:39:30.680 --> 3:39:44.680]  Or if you're doing business with these people and they have a legitimate means for collecting your information so they can sell you more soap or whatever, they have now taken away your ability to come after these companies that turn over your information to the government.
[3:39:44.680 --> 3:39:52.680]  They've taken away your ability to sue them with CISA. And that's the key thing there that the government can now pull that in and start getting information about you.
[3:39:52.680 --> 3:40:06.680]  And even if you haven't gone to something that you don't care about, like a porn site, by getting all this information, all this metadata, they're able to do activity-based intelligence, human domain analytics to see if the phony narratives that they're selling people,
[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:14.680]  for instance, the Russians hacked our elections. Is that really working with the American public? Let's look at what they're talking about. Let's look at where they're going.
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:24.680]  Let's look at what they're putting on social media. And then we can determine whether our fake narrative is really gaining traction with the American public. That is a very dangerous thing.
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:46.680]  Absolutely. But to finish answering your question, you asked specifically about the CIA's capabilities of hacking and getting access to us, American citizens, and you also mentioned James Curly, the director of the FBI.
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:41:02.680]  Well, if you remember when San Bernardino happened to shooting, the FBI went to Apple and demanded that Apple give them a master key to all iPhones, meaning that they could unlock anybody. They didn't need a master key.
[3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:24.680]  They didn't. Anyway, so I went on CNN and I debated the FBI's mouthpiece of Steve Rogers. And by the way, one of the slickest men I have ever met, I watched a lot of his interviews with CNN, Fox and others before I debated him.
[3:41:24.680 --> 3:41:32.680]  And his entire thing was about, you have to give up some privacy so that we can secure you.
[3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:34.680]  Give up your freedom. Give up your privacy.
[3:41:34.680 --> 3:41:50.680]  Fox going to go down that road with him. He was too slick. So I came at it from the other angle. My problem is not privacy versus security, which in fact it is. But for this case, no.
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:42:04.680]  My problem is we have a certain degree of security. Now you are asking America to allow you to make us completely insecure because once you get that key, you can't keep it.
[3:42:04.680 --> 3:42:13.680]  It's an electronic key. It's bits and bytes. You cannot keep this from hackers and the whole world will know.
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:24.680]  And that's what we've seen in Vault 7. And he finally said, maybe Mr. McAfee, we can work together. Fat chance the FBI will ever call me for help.
[3:42:24.680 --> 3:42:32.680]  Well, he may be working with the Washington Post because we have to remember when we go back to Watergate and that's one of the things when Donald Trump tweeted out about wiretaps.
[3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:41.680]  He said, this is like Nixon and Watergate. And I think quite frankly it is. We have to remember that Deep Throat was a deputy director of the FBI at that time.
[3:42:41.680 --> 3:42:51.680]  So we saw a coup happening there. We see an attempted coup happening here. Why isn't the FBI investigating the people who have leaked this information out of the intelligence community?
[3:42:51.680 --> 3:42:58.680]  Why aren't they looking at that instead? They're telling us, and this is what Comey said today, we do have an ongoing investigation against the Russians.
[3:42:58.680 --> 3:43:04.680]  We don't know anything, but we have a lot of innuendo, a lot of character assassination we're gonna put out there.
[3:43:04.680 --> 3:43:14.680]  CNN saying the bizarre saga of President Trump's claims that he was wiretapped. There's nothing bizarre about that. We all know that that's happening to everybody.
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:23.680]  But we've had director, former CIA and former NSA director Michael Hayden say, we don't listen to bad people. We listen to interesting people.
[3:43:23.680 --> 3:43:30.680]  Do you think, John McAfee, they would have thought that Donald Trump was an interesting person when he's running for president, when he's president-elect?
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:44.680]  Well, if not, I don't know who is. But seriously, the FBI and the CIA, I know that it's a crime to do what just happened to release us.
[3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:59.680]  But good God Almighty, we need to know these things. I'm sorry. And if someone has to do a crime to do it, because the crime is in having secret societies.
[3:43:59.680 --> 3:44:11.680]  We have 17 of them in America. The CIA, the NSA, the FBI and all 14 covert agencies within the Pentagon. These are secret societies.
[3:44:11.680 --> 3:44:24.680]  Dwight Eisenhower and even President Kennedy warned us against the dangers of secret societies. And so, yes, go ahead. I'm glad somebody hacked it.
[3:44:24.680 --> 3:44:28.680]  I'm glad they took it out. And I hope the hell they get away.
[3:44:28.680 --> 3:44:34.680]  Yes, well, you know, actually, I think it's very interesting because WikiLeaks talked about this as Vault 7 was happening.
[3:44:34.680 --> 3:44:41.680]  They said, look, they didn't copyright any of this code that they were using to burglarize everybody's computers and devices, because they didn't want this to go out.
[3:44:41.680 --> 3:44:54.680]  So there's no copyright violation. And they didn't classify any of it, because if they did, John, then they would be guilty of violating handling classified documents by distributing this code.
[3:44:54.680 --> 3:45:01.680]  It's not classified. And this is only the beginning of the Vault 7 revelations that we've seen from WikiLeaks. There's going to be more of those coming out.
[3:45:01.680 --> 3:45:10.680]  So I don't think that this is like the Snowden leaks or even like the Project Dragnet information that we got from Mike Zulo that we had earlier on in Jerome Corsi.
[3:45:10.680 --> 3:45:16.680]  They were talking about this whistleblower Montgomery, who showed that they were between 2004-2010.
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:31.680]  The NSA was actually getting information about Donald Trump. They had 18 addresses of his businesses. They had another eight or nine addresses of people like his golf pro, where they were surveilling everything about him, surveilling Alex Jones.
[3:45:31.680 --> 3:45:41.680]  Now, that's information that was put out there by whistleblower. But I think Vault 7 is not really something that they can even come after them as putting out secured documents, because they're not classified.
[3:45:41.680 --> 3:45:57.680]  But even if they do, please, let's get real. We need to change the way that we view information, and especially secret information. We're living in the age of cybersecurity.
[3:45:57.680 --> 3:46:16.680]  I promise you, there is not one secret in this world. There isn't. Hackers are so good that they will get whatever they want. And if someone wants that data from the CIA, maybe it was an inside job and someone took it more than likely, but I don't know.
[3:46:16.680 --> 3:46:31.680]  But they can't keep it secret forever. This is what we don't understand. We've got massive cyber weapons that we've developed, enough to destroy the world a million times over, far more deadly than nuclear weapons.
[3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:50.680]  And yet those weapons can never be kept secret. The delusion belongs with the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI, who actually believe that they have secrets. Please, God, we're living in 2017. Wake up. Go to the dark web.
[3:46:50.680 --> 3:46:53.680]  There's every secret on the dark web.
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:47:05.680]  Yes, absolutely. And I think the point that you made earlier, and I remember when you came on our show and talked about the fact that you went on and debated Rogers and said, look, if you had that key, you're going to lose that key.
[3:47:05.680 --> 3:47:17.680]  And now we've seen that they've lost thousands of keys in the people's devices through Vault 7. And this whole idea that you've got privacy, that you can give up your privacy to get security, that's nonsense.
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:20.680]  Whenever you give up your privacy, you've lost your security.
[3:47:20.680 --> 3:47:26.680]  Yes. And also, that was, by the way, $100 billion put into that hacking.
[3:47:26.680 --> 3:47:40.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me ask you this, because we've got a lot of articles that were up on dredge today about robot police. We've got a air force of drones that they are talking about putting over London.
[3:47:40.680 --> 3:47:53.680]  All of this information that is being put in place, we're looking at autonomous killing machines that DARPA is working on for the military. This is where it really, really gets dangerous.
[3:47:53.680 --> 3:48:00.680]  You pointed out it's already very dangerous, far more dangerous than people realize if they can hack into nuclear power plants or whatever.
[3:48:00.680 --> 3:48:14.680]  But we are looking at an explosion in the threat level as we add cars to the Internet of Things. What's going to happen to that? Not only are they going to destroy your privacy and monitor everything you do, but they have the ability to kill you.
[3:48:14.680 --> 3:48:21.680]  As we pointed out with Michael Hastings years ago, they can easily kill you. And they talked about that at the time Richard Clark did.
[3:48:21.680 --> 3:48:37.680]  By hacking your car from 3,000 miles away, think about this, leading absolutely no tracks. But you talked about robot police and the evolution of cybersecurity and possibly AI and the Internet of Things.
[3:48:37.680 --> 3:48:55.680]  You know, I think somehow, I'm 72 and I've turned a little bit cynical. I think there's something in the human race which is self-destructive. I don't know what it is. I mean, we all love and we feel joy and love our families.
[3:48:55.680 --> 3:49:11.680]  We have grace and generosity. But finally, someone who does not also have greed, jealousy, anger and hatred. So I think something within us as a society is self-destructed.
[3:49:11.680 --> 3:49:21.680]  And it takes a few individuals awake enough to yell the warning, whoa, stop. I'm one of those.
[3:49:21.680 --> 3:49:33.680]  Yeah, exactly. You know, I've interviewed, John, I've interviewed Hugo DaGarris about his Artelec war where he says, hey, we're going to create artificial intelligence that's going to be so smart that it can choose to destroy us if it wishes.
[3:49:33.680 --> 3:49:42.680]  And yet, even though he puts that warning out there, he says, I have to do it because it's a technical challenge to create the next level of device out here.
[3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:52.680]  And I've known a lot of engineers, you're an engineer, who take that bargain with the devil and say, we want to create the next impressive thing. It's an intellectual challenge to us.
[3:49:52.680 --> 3:49:59.680]  And they don't think, or if they do think about it, they don't even care about the consequences. That's the amazing thing to me.
[3:49:59.680 --> 3:50:11.680]  But this has been with us forever. I mean, when we detonated the first atomic bomb, there were some scientists who truly believed that the chain reaction would not end.
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:15.680]  It would simply destroy the Earth. And did it anyway. Yeah, they did that.
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:31.680]  So, yes, and then AI is, I'm not saying we shouldn't have AI. No, nor have smart robots. But please, let's be smart enough to realize our own limitations and stupidities.
[3:50:31.680 --> 3:50:41.680]  Otherwise, we're going to end up with some appendage on some massive electronic brain.
[3:50:41.680 --> 3:51:02.680]  Very concerning to see where this is going. Stay with us. We have to take a quick break. We're going to be right back with John McAfee.

[3:53:58.680 --> 3:54:24.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we're talking to John McAfee. We're talking about Vault 7, the wiretaps, the red herring of the Russians hacked our election. We're talking about all those issues.
[3:54:24.680 --> 3:54:37.680]  But I want to read for you here a quote before we go back to John, get his reaction to this. Actually, I want to get a positive direction for us to go from John McAfee. He's a person who made a fortune with McAfee antivirus software.
[3:54:37.680 --> 3:54:46.680]  We need to know what we can do. And I know that's why he ran for election was try to wake up the American public to the danger of what we call cybersecurity.
[3:54:46.680 --> 3:54:57.680]  But WikiLeaks pointed this out as we talk about this Russian hacking stuff. They said US agencies have interfered with 81 elections. And that doesn't include the coups that the CIA has been involved with.
[3:54:57.680 --> 3:55:06.680]  They also point out in the last French election. Remember, they're talking about all the Russians are hacking the French elections. Well, possibly, but also the Americans, I'm sure, are as well.
[3:55:06.680 --> 3:55:20.680]  They say all major French political parties were targeted for infiltration by the CIA's human intelligence, that's human and electronic, SIGINT intelligence spies in the seven months leading up to France's 2012 presidential election.
[3:55:20.680 --> 3:55:29.680]  That would include Francois Hollande and Sarkozy and Le Pen. All of those people, all the political parties in France were all infiltrated by the CIA.
[3:55:29.680 --> 3:55:40.680]  So we know they did it here in America as well. Coups are not limited to simply foreign governments. All the instruments of so-called defense abroad will be brought home as instruments of tyranny.
[3:55:40.680 --> 3:55:53.680]  We weren't about that by the founding fathers. James Mason told us that. But I want to talk to John McAfee. John, you ran for president, as I said, to try to draw people's attention to the vulnerabilities that we have with the cybersecurity that are developing.
[3:55:53.680 --> 3:56:01.680]  Tell us a solution. What can we do to try to move forward with this? Because you wanted people to understand this. Tell us some positive things here.
[3:56:01.680 --> 3:56:10.680]  First of all, I'd like to apologize for smoking on the air, but the last time I was in Alex Jones' studio, he broke his rule and allowed me to smoke.
[3:56:10.680 --> 3:56:13.680]  That's fine. I'm perfectly fine with you smoking.
[3:56:13.680 --> 3:56:25.680]  It might be because while I was in his studio, he left his gun outside and I had mine on me. In any case, I apologize, but I do smoke.
[3:56:25.680 --> 3:56:40.680]  What can we do? Well, I have given up hope that the citizenry themselves will dump these things called smartphones and mobile devices because they are what the CIA uses most.
[3:56:40.680 --> 3:56:50.680]  Not just the CIA. Every hacker in the world. These things are designed as spy devices, literally.
[3:56:50.680 --> 3:56:59.680]  We actually had the NSA slides as part of the Snowden leaks. They said, who would have thought in 1984, and they showed the pictures of the iconic Apple 1984 commercial.
[3:56:59.680 --> 3:57:09.680]  They said, who would have thought in 1984 that these, and they showed Steve Jobs holding up a smartphone, would become Big Brother and people would line up to buy them, and they showed the big crowds of Apple stores.
[3:57:09.680 --> 3:57:21.680]  Absolutely. So for the past four years, I've been working on a new paradigm of cybersecurity because we all know antivirus software doesn't work.
[3:57:21.680 --> 3:57:33.680]  Every major hack, everyone was all protected by the latest antivirus software. It doesn't work. It can't work. Hackers don't do that anymore.
[3:57:33.680 --> 3:57:44.680]  95% of hacking is social engineering. Something, by the way, the CIA apparently knows nothing about. So that's scary in itself.
[3:57:44.680 --> 3:58:00.680]  So I'm building a set of tools. Number one, we just got my company MGT. By the way, I want to do a tangent a little later about the Securities and Exchange Commission and how they are killing business.
[3:58:00.680 --> 3:58:11.680]  But other than that, my company MGT, it's a public stock, is manufacturing number one, the world first.
[3:58:11.680 --> 3:58:18.680]  Okay, hang on a second. John, we got to take a hard break here. If you can hang on for another five minutes, we will let you finish that up.
[3:58:18.680 --> 3:58:24.680]  And I want to get, this will be out on the video when we put it up on YouTube. We're talking to John McAfee. Join us tonight for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[3:58:24.680 --> 3:58:31.680]  We're going to go live. We're going to cover Trump's rally. Take your phone calls as we did last week. 7th Central, 8 p.m. Eastern. Join us then.
[3:58:31.680 --> 3:58:55.680]  And stay with us, John. We're going to finish up this interview. We'll be right back.
