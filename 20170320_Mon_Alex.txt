[00:00:02.447 --> 00:00:06.769]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:42.432]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Monday, March 20th, 2017.
[00:00:42.432 --> 00:00:44.193]  If you go to DrugsReport.com,
[00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:58.044]  You can see the headline right in the middle column.
[00:00:58.044 --> 00:01:00.785]  It's been there since yesterday afternoon.
[00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:06.548]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Trump and his family.
[00:01:06.548 --> 00:01:10.330]  Bombshell discovery shows targets of NSA's Project Dragnet.
[00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.191]  That's an admitted illegal project.
[00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:16.353]  And now we've gotten basically the indexes of it, or our sources have.
[00:01:16.353 --> 00:01:19.615]  It's Sheriff Joe Arpaio's cold case.
[00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:21.456]  Posse's had this for two years.
[00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.078]  He, of course, is now out of office as of last year.
[00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:26.595]  Voted out of office.
[00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:33.722]  And so that information has now been put out via Infowars.com because the feds, obviously under Obama, did nothing.
[00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:35.724]  Well, there's a new sheriff in town in D.C.
[00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:37.605]  and this information is out.
[00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:42.190]  Trump talked last week about soon you'll see evidence of NSA spying.
[00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.534]  And this goes back, as far as Obama's concerned, eight years.
[00:01:48.334 --> 00:01:48.974]  Eight years.
[00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:49.875]  But isn't it interesting?
[00:01:49.875 --> 00:02:10.522]  DrudgeReport.com, the biggest news site in the world, hands down, second largest website in the world, period, after MSN, top-linked in the corner last night, then it moved down this morning to the middle column, NSA documents, surveillance on Trump family more, Project Dragnet.
[00:02:12.068 --> 00:02:15.090]  You'd think MSM would at least come out and say it wasn't true.
[00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:26.177]  Kind of like when we got the Mayak reports from the state police and then from federal marshals and other copy from a different division because they were all different variants depending on who they were sent to.
[00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:28.038]  And for a week the media ignored it.
[00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:29.018]  Then they said it was fake.
[00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:30.979]  Then they said, OK, it's real.
[00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:31.800]  Well, of course it was real.
[00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:36.670]  I didn't just get it from my sources and believe it.
[00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.833]  I also called the phone numbers on there and the FBI is like, you're not supposed to have that.
[00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:42.974]  Where are you?
[00:02:42.974 --> 00:02:45.396]  And then little arguments about it.
[00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:46.136]  I said, it's already out.
[00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:47.437]  I already have it.
[00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:48.218]  It's ready to be published.
[00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:49.599]  I'm publishing it right now.
[00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.559]  So there you go.
[00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:55.563]  NSA documents, surveillance on Trump family, more.
[00:02:55.563 --> 00:02:56.884]  Project Dragnet.
[00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:03.960]  And you know they've been scurrying around since yesterday afternoon trying to figure out how to respond to this.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.960]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.622]  Guess what's going up in the next hour?
[00:03:12.622 --> 00:03:16.323]  We've talked to Sheriff Arpaio because this deals with him and a lot more.
[00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:21.104]  He's going to kind of recuse himself at this point, stay out of it and let the press deal with it.
[00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:25.285]  But we do have his former chief deputy on the cold case posse joining us coming up.
[00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:31.448]  That's not the only exclusive information, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:43.111]  Roger Stone gave me this information this morning, and it is the Senate letter.
[00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:45.632]  I have so much in front of me that I can't find it now.
[00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:48.253]  Will you reprint me the Senate letter, please, and put it on screen?
[00:03:48.253 --> 00:03:50.093]  Thank you.
[00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:52.454]  And Roger Stone is going to be joining us
[00:03:53.547 --> 00:03:56.409]  Coming up, he just had to dodge a bunch of reporters at his house.
[00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:04.253]  He's going into the studio office right now and is on with us in 15 minutes.
[00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:16.099]  We have, of course, the exclusive Senate letter that you see in the press today, where he is being ordered to preserve all his information pertaining to any contacts with the Russians.
[00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.640]  Of course, there was a hit and run, I found it.
[00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:19.812]  There was a hit and run last week.
[00:04:19.812 --> 00:04:20.372]  T-boating him.
[00:04:20.372 --> 00:04:21.833]  He was poisoned with polonium before that.
[00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:24.433]  They want him dead before the Senate hearings begin.
[00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:28.794]  I hope three isn't the charm and they try to kill him a third time, but here it is.
[00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:32.735]  This is the U.S.
[00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:34.075]  Senate.
[00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:35.936]  Roger Stone.
[00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:38.456]  Maybe I should cover up his home address that's on there.
[00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:42.257]  He just told me to put the thing out, but let's actually black that out before we do that.
[00:04:43.732 --> 00:04:46.614]  Things are moving really, really quick here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:46.614 --> 00:04:48.376]  Obviously, this is real news.
[00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:49.817]  This is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:49.817 --> 00:04:52.039]  It's why we're under attack more than anybody.
[00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.743]  And if it wasn't for Drudge Report, most folks wouldn't even know about the story the media once blacked out.
[00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:07.631]  The House Intelligence Committee hearing today on Russia and the 2016 elections has been quite the fake news, anti-Trump, double standard ceremony.
[00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:13.255]  Led by the anti-Trump team of Schiff, Comey, and Nunes, the 2020 Globalist Democrat campaign for U.S.
[00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:14.476]  President has begun.
[00:05:14.476 --> 00:05:19.579]  Admiral Rogers of the NSA could not answer many questions due to national security and classified information.
[00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:22.982]  The hearing was loaded with canned questions, responses, and lawyer talk.
[00:05:22.982 --> 00:05:27.545]  The Trump-Russia narrative echoed with, there was no wiretapping, attacks peppered in.
[00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:28.806]  So now, U.S.
[00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:38.539]  officials are discussing the investigation of Russian influence on the Trump campaign and the election, but at the same time attacking Trump for claiming he was being investigated by the U.S.
[00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.201]  government during these investigations.
[00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:41.563]  1984 doublethink in the flesh.
[00:05:43.425 --> 00:05:44.466]  Understand this.
[00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:48.992]  This hearing and all other related hearings or narratives are nothing more than the globalist Democrat U.S.
[00:05:48.992 --> 00:05:50.354]  presidential campaign for 2020.
[00:05:50.354 --> 00:05:56.982]  They will try to delegitimize President Trump with fake news, then attack him on it the entire 2020 campaign.
[00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:59.225]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.910]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.493]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:11.674]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[00:06:11.674 --> 00:06:21.458]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:22.299]  Caveman.
[00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:27.361]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:29.462]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:29.762 --> 00:06:32.904]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:38.067]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:38.067 --> 00:06:46.132]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:46.132 --> 00:06:54.057]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:54.057 --> 00:06:58.820]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:08.005]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.

[00:08:17.432 --> 00:08:23.936]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.437]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:30.930]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.893]  It's Monday, March 20th, 2017.
[00:08:33.893 --> 00:08:38.477]  I'm coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:47.324]  I'm Alex Jones with my amazing crew and of course the wonderful listeners and viewers who are the heart of the rebellion against globalism that is sweeping the planet.
[00:08:47.324 --> 00:08:50.467]  The elites are striking back against our nationalist president.
[00:08:51.067 --> 00:09:00.016]  He's already put three trillion dollars in the stock market thanks to the confidence he's created and had the best small jobs and small business recovery since 1984.
[00:09:00.016 --> 00:09:09.825]  He's destroyed the TPP, their global government pyramid capstone, and they are in full piranha swarm attack mode.
[00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:12.567]  Gallup is back to fake polls.
[00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:17.168]  They have key demographics, key phone numbers they can call, where they can produce any numbers they want.
[00:09:17.168 --> 00:09:22.669]  Does anybody believe that Trump has fallen from 56 down to 37 in a national poll?
[00:09:22.669 --> 00:09:23.869]  No.
[00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:28.971]  They've waited a few months, still oversampling Democrats and others.
[00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:33.592]  Then they call up with leading questions and make the president look bad, trying to stall him.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:41.745]  Just like I told you the polls were fake during the election, and exactly what I told you turned out to be accurate, because it's well known.
[00:09:41.745 --> 00:09:44.846]  I talked to people in the polling industry.
[00:09:44.846 --> 00:09:46.908]  I talked to the highest levels of the government.
[00:09:46.908 --> 00:09:49.850]  I talked to high-level Republicans, Democrats, you name it.
[00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:55.773]  We've never seen such unified fraud in an election by the pollsters, but that's what happened here.
[00:09:55.773 --> 00:09:58.975]  We've seen a lot of corruption, but it's unprecedented.
[00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:03.178]  So they're back, just with a full press attack, trying to create the illusion
[00:10:05.373 --> 00:10:09.015]  That Trump's on the rocks trying to create a bandwagon effect.
[00:10:09.015 --> 00:10:17.320]  And Mr. President, I know you were busy trying to turn the economy back on and shave the Republic and trying to rebuild our nation's borders and defenses.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.282]  You've done an incredible job 60 days in.
[00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:28.566]  But Mr. President, Mr. President, you're under full soft coup attack.
[00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:32.809]  I, of course, coined that term in the modern parlance.
[00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:34.850]  Limbaugh's picked up on that because that's what it is.
[00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:51.916]  There is a ongoing opposition party, globalist, media, collaborator, combine that is openly probing the White House defenses, that is openly getting the blueprints to Trump Tower, that is openly training to smuggle bombs in.
[00:10:51.916 --> 00:10:52.917]  That's been confirmed today.
[00:10:52.917 --> 00:10:55.057]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:10:55.057 --> 00:10:56.418]  You have to go on the offense.
[00:10:56.418 --> 00:10:57.478]  You have to go on the offense now.
[00:10:58.993 --> 00:11:02.756]  You can't take Congress to play, you know, the bowl at the White House.
[00:11:02.756 --> 00:11:07.759]  You can't be nice to everybody and just say, can't we have American prosperity again and just try to be normal.
[00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:09.220]  These are scum.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.400]  They don't want to place the table.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.181]  They want to destroy the country.
[00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:13.342]  They're parasites.
[00:11:13.342 --> 00:11:14.263]  They're trash.
[00:11:14.263 --> 00:11:16.984]  They're control freaks.
[00:11:16.984 --> 00:11:22.427]  And you've got to go on the offense about Hillary and the Democrats who have been openly on the Communist Chinese payroll.
[00:11:22.427 --> 00:11:23.928]  I know a lot of Republicans have.
[00:11:23.928 --> 00:11:24.489]  Burn them all!
[00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:26.630]  You haven't.
[00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.431]  You're aware of the takeover, the intelligence agencies are.
[00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:32.952]  The country's hanging by a thread before the election, and still is.
[00:11:32.952 --> 00:11:34.713]  And everybody's gone to sleep!
[00:11:34.713 --> 00:11:41.796]  I kept telling you day one, the war just started!
[00:11:41.796 --> 00:11:44.297]  This country is in incredibly dire straits, so is the world.
[00:11:44.297 --> 00:11:46.058]  Kim Jong Un has said he will turn the U.S.
[00:11:46.058 --> 00:11:47.279]  into ashes.
[00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:54.642]  Said if one shot gets fired, he's gonna nuke Seoul, South Korea, Tokyo, Japan, and claims he can hit the United States.
[00:11:55.407 --> 00:12:04.496]  And of course, you know, Tillerson, with the talk of this already last week, now it's intensified, said, okay, we may have to first strike and start loading atomic weapons onto those missiles.
[00:12:04.496 --> 00:12:15.706]  And the videos that they put of him, Kim Jong-un, this total wimp, all walking tough with all his generals behind him, and he's a total parasite, the definition of pathetic evil.
[00:12:15.706 --> 00:12:20.451]  The absolute definition of a cult, a country run by a psycho cult of loons.
[00:12:21.917 --> 00:12:23.738]  Feeding on their poor people.
[00:12:23.738 --> 00:12:27.180]  This is government worship at its most disgusting.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.043]  At its peak.
[00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:33.604]  Roger Stone's joining us for the next 5-10 minutes.
[00:12:33.604 --> 00:12:35.225]  He had to leave his home and go to his studio.
[00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:37.346]  He was mobbed by reporters trying to get out of his house.
[00:12:37.346 --> 00:12:38.067]  Didn't talk to them.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.023]  And he's going to his office studios to give us the exclusive, the Senate Committee this morning.
[00:12:44.023 --> 00:12:48.085]  Over and over again, Roger Stone, Roger Stone, connections to Russia, Roger Stone.
[00:12:48.085 --> 00:12:53.809]  He's been hit with polonium, he got t-boned by a car in a hit-and-run last week, hitting right in the door where he was, the passenger side.
[00:12:53.809 --> 00:12:58.492]  It's now been covered by mainstream media.
[00:12:58.492 --> 00:13:01.674]  They don't want him alive, they want to just demonize him.
[00:13:01.674 --> 00:13:07.658]  We've got Comey refusing to answer questions about Roger Stone and Russia's possible ties.
[00:13:07.658 --> 00:13:08.719]  Now let's continue here.
[00:13:10.677 --> 00:13:23.665]  Here is the letter that he got, the exclusive committee letter that you hear about in the news, where they're saying that Stone needs to keep all Russia-related material.
[00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:25.607]  So he's going to give us that exclusively here.
[00:13:25.607 --> 00:13:28.409]  We're going to break it down coming up as soon as he joins us.
[00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:32.211]  But this is truly an incredible time to be alive.
[00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:33.372]  Now, let's get to the story.
[00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:42.671]  That is only on DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com.
[00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:48.816]  There's an absolute news blackout on this.
[00:13:48.816 --> 00:14:01.366]  You've got these agencies that are illegally spying on the American people for decades, intensifying it, major corporations like Google, probably beyond the NSA spying, driving around with their mobile cars, breaking into people's
[00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:05.430]  Wireless and stealing their passcodes.
[00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.311]  That's all come out in the news.
[00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:15.974]  Robot cars driving around with camera snorkels scanning your house, but also grabbing your passwords and breaking into your computer.
[00:14:15.974 --> 00:14:24.618]  This is the mega massive level of garbage that we're talking about.
[00:14:24.618 --> 00:14:29.520]  Now, you can see we're getting Roger Stone hooked up on Skype right now.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.800]  And I want to get a clear image.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.021]  We should probably try to reconnect with him.
[00:14:34.445 --> 00:14:35.305]  This is a war, folks.
[00:14:35.305 --> 00:14:36.045]  This isn't radio.
[00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:36.966]  This isn't TV.
[00:14:36.966 --> 00:14:40.007]  This is the defense of the Republic, point blank, against the globalists.
[00:14:40.007 --> 00:14:40.787]  We all need your prayers.
[00:14:40.787 --> 00:14:41.387]  We need your support.
[00:14:41.387 --> 00:14:43.608]  You notice, we're in the focal point.
[00:14:43.608 --> 00:14:46.748]  I'm in these NSA documents being surveilled.
[00:14:46.748 --> 00:14:48.929]  My private office is being surveilled.
[00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:52.510]  Trump Tower is being surveilled.
[00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.071]  The only place you're going to see it is InfoWars.com and DrudgeReport.com.
[00:14:56.071 --> 00:14:59.592]  The only place with the courage to cover these documents
[00:15:01.187 --> 00:15:04.148]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[00:15:04.148 --> 00:15:10.330]  Bombshell discovery shows targets of NSA Project Dragnet.
[00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.951]  Almost everything I talk about is in the news within hours.
[00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:14.552]  Media matters within hours.
[00:15:14.552 --> 00:15:17.753]  Democratic Party funded within hours.
[00:15:17.753 --> 00:15:19.374]  Their institutions are after us.
[00:15:19.374 --> 00:15:23.935]  This came out yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock.
[00:15:23.935 --> 00:15:28.517]  Zero coverage as of showtime 15 minutes ago as a broadcast kickoff.
[00:15:29.747 --> 00:15:30.507]  Zero.
[00:15:30.507 --> 00:15:32.548]  We have the documents.
[00:15:32.548 --> 00:15:36.349]  This comes from federal court cases.
[00:15:36.349 --> 00:15:49.914]  And this is what Arpaio and detectives have been working on, and they gave this to the feds years ago from their own investigation, and a Snowden-like whistleblower that came to them with, of course, the founder of Judicial Watch, Larry Klayman.
[00:15:49.914 --> 00:15:50.354]  And that's all.
[00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:52.535]  So the only other place we're having any of this is Newsmax.
[00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.516]  They've got a report on Klayman's investigation.
[00:15:54.516 --> 00:15:56.196]  I forgot to have you guys print that for me.
[00:15:56.196 --> 00:15:58.457]  With this whistleblower, but not these particular documents.
[00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:15.795]  But this is so big, but what's bigger is the total silence as they figure out how to spin this, as they figure out how to lie about this, if they have to.
[00:16:15.795 --> 00:16:16.395]  If they have to.
[00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:28.961]  They're hoping that everybody just ignores it, and ignores DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com, and they're hoping that everybody's so compartmentalized and so tribal, like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity or anybody else, that they don't go cover this.
[00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:32.644]  Just like they hope with the MIAC report, where the feds were trying to go after the veterans and gun owners.
[00:16:32.644 --> 00:16:36.268]  No, that was a real report, they had to admit it, but it took over a week.
[00:16:36.268 --> 00:16:40.832]  This has to come out today, while Comey is up there in front of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate.
[00:16:41.937 --> 00:16:54.919]  And they're talking about Roger Stone and he three times refuses to not say, we're going to play this coming up after Roger leaves us, three times they refuse to say whether Stone is a person of interest as a Russian agent or not.
[00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:56.220]  Total bull.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.241]  Even though the Senate committee and the House committee have also come out and said, so far no evidence.
[00:17:01.241 --> 00:17:02.881]  But they keep repeating the lie.
[00:17:02.881 --> 00:17:08.342]  And then saying no evidence of Trump being spied on, even though the New York Times admitted it four times.
[00:17:09.318 --> 00:17:15.702]  I'd said three, it was four times the week of January 20th saying specifically they were spying on him.
[00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:27.968]  So the man of the month, the man of the year here, the guy they chose to pick out as the bad guy that he's been hit with polonium, they tried to kill him in a hit and run last week, classic CIA style, and now here he is.
[00:17:27.968 --> 00:17:32.851]  It's like we're living in an action-adventure movie, but it's real.
[00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:35.873]  And we've got breaking in the next 15 minutes at InfoWars.com.
[00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:42.986]  The next 15 minutes, ladies and gentlemen, more documents on Arpaio and his case being spied on by Obama.
[00:17:42.986 --> 00:17:51.792]  Total felony criminal action with the documents, with the surveillance information on his home, his office, on the sheriff by Obama during the court case.
[00:17:51.792 --> 00:17:53.153]  So, unprecedented.
[00:17:53.153 --> 00:17:54.754]  Roger Stone, thank you for joining us.
[00:17:54.754 --> 00:17:58.417]  This is just a whirlwind of information breaking right now.
[00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.673]  Alex, it's been quite a morning to say the least.
[00:18:02.673 --> 00:18:06.977]  As you know, I received a formal letter from the U.S.
[00:18:06.977 --> 00:18:13.022]  Senate Intelligence Committee via email very late Thursday.
[00:18:13.022 --> 00:18:17.445]  They said they've been trying to mail it to me for a month, but couldn't find my address.
[00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:26.554]  That gives one pause about the committee that's supposed to be overseeing our out-of-control intelligence services.
[00:18:26.554 --> 00:18:46.703]  Once again, I hear my name dragged through the mud at this morning's hearings, but I assure you that any inference that my interaction, as brief and limited as it was, and now fully and completely disclosed, does not constitute collusion based on facts,
[00:18:47.483 --> 00:18:51.866]  Timeline and so on.
[00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:57.110]  So once I have the opportunity, I will lay that timeline out.
[00:18:58.032 --> 00:19:00.913]  For the Senate or the House.
[00:19:00.913 --> 00:19:03.174]  But I want public hearings.
[00:19:03.174 --> 00:19:06.916]  I don't want this behind closed doors.
[00:19:06.916 --> 00:19:15.359]  This Chairman, the Ranking Member, Adam Schiff maligns me, a member of the committee, Swalwell from California.
[00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:26.424]  They hide behind their congressional immunity, implying that my brief and now public and one-time communications with
[00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:38.376]  Crucifer 2, a man who may or may not be a Russian asset, just because the intelligence agencies say he is, does not make it.
[00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:41.518]  Roger, I understand you keep putting your case out, which is a fact.
[00:19:41.518 --> 00:19:42.879]  It's innocuous.
[00:19:42.879 --> 00:19:43.840]  It's benign.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.161]  So this is a headshot.
[00:19:46.161 --> 00:19:50.663]  It's a takedown because I was an MVP, as you were in the election.
[00:19:50.663 --> 00:19:52.184]  And that's what Media Matters internal...
[00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:57.847]  And that's what Media Matters internal reports that Project Veritas got out show.
[00:19:57.847 --> 00:19:59.087]  They're working with the White House.
[00:19:59.087 --> 00:19:59.887]  They're working with Hillary.
[00:19:59.887 --> 00:20:05.630]  They're working with CNN to block Roger Stone, the MVP, to demonize him, to attack him.
[00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.150]  And then meanwhile, of course we're all trying to talk to WikiLeaks.
[00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.351]  CNN talks to them.
[00:20:09.351 --> 00:20:10.351]  So does Fox News.
[00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:11.592]  Of course we're trying to talk to Goose for 2.0.
[00:20:12.532 --> 00:20:14.454]  I've had media call me for years saying, do you know Guccifer?
[00:20:14.454 --> 00:20:16.896]  We've got email people claiming they're Guccifer.
[00:20:16.896 --> 00:20:17.996]  Probably the FBI.
[00:20:17.996 --> 00:20:19.998]  Of course it's media outlets we try to talk to people.
[00:20:19.998 --> 00:20:26.323]  But the point is, is that they've got you in a public chat room congratulating Guccifer 2.0 for having their account restored.
[00:20:26.323 --> 00:20:27.684]  So that's the proof you're a Russian agent.
[00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:33.108]  Meanwhile, they admit that there's no real connection to you, Trump or Flynn, to any of the Russians.
[00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:37.372]  All they have is Flynn lining up a phone call, which he was supposed to do once the president was elected.
[00:20:38.032 --> 00:20:48.071]  Well, and my exchange with Guccifer is almost six weeks after the public release of the Wikidet documents, which I am purported to have colluded with him to leak.
[00:20:49.296 --> 00:20:54.921]  Off-air, off-air, you've told me you're angry, Roger Stone, you're sick of it, you use some fine language.
[00:20:54.921 --> 00:21:00.385]  You want in front of these cowards, these scumbags, you tell me you wish you could sue them if they didn't have immunity.
[00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:04.929]  I mean, you're pissed, you're a red-blooded American that served this country in a great fashion for decades.
[00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:08.372]  So to repeat what you've told me off-air, directly to these scumbag faces, go ahead.
[00:21:09.005 --> 00:21:18.709]  Look, yesterday Chairman Schiff was all over saying the information regarding Russian collusion was circumstantial.
[00:21:18.709 --> 00:21:26.352]  So don't malign me in hearings, but then not afford me the opportunity to respond in the same forum.
[00:21:26.352 --> 00:21:29.233]  That would be intrinsically unfair.
[00:21:30.113 --> 00:21:35.418]  I am jonesing to appear before the committee and clarify this matter.
[00:21:35.418 --> 00:21:47.229]  But while we're there, we need to talk about who wiretapped Donald Trump using this Russian thing as their rationale, their phony rationale.
[00:21:47.229 --> 00:21:48.431]  They have no evidence.
[00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:57.059]  This treasure trove of Cucumber 2 was dropped on me to elicit this headline.
[00:21:57.059 --> 00:22:01.666]  Trump Associate Admits Communication With Russian Hacker.
[00:22:01.666 --> 00:22:03.027]  Misleading.
[00:22:03.027 --> 00:22:03.788]  Salacious.
[00:22:04.309 --> 00:22:05.150]  Not factual.
[00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.511]  Let me just stop you though, because this is so crystal clear.
[00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:10.573]  They were in the New York Times four times the week of the inauguration.
[00:22:10.573 --> 00:22:15.877]  On the day of the inauguration, naming you, saying we have transcripts of you and Flynn talking to the Russians.
[00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:19.059]  You get on live camera with us, you say this is insane.
[00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:22.982]  Live, you say, how dare them, that they need to release these transcripts.
[00:22:22.982 --> 00:22:24.523]  I've never talked to any Russians.
[00:22:24.523 --> 00:22:28.186]  Then they come out months later and go, okay, there's no evidence of them talking to Russians.
[00:22:28.646 --> 00:22:32.127]  The House Intelligence Committee head Nunes says there's nothing in the transcripts.
[00:22:32.127 --> 00:22:36.388]  There's literally not even phone calls with Roger Stone or any of these people.
[00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:38.729]  And so then they go, oh, there's never been any wiretapping.
[00:22:38.729 --> 00:22:39.929]  There's never been any intercepts.
[00:22:39.929 --> 00:22:40.969]  They're insane.
[00:22:40.969 --> 00:22:41.850]  Impeach Trump.
[00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.770]  We never wiretapped any of these people.
[00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:45.811]  I mean, they act like we're morons.
[00:22:45.811 --> 00:22:47.371]  And now I want you to speak to that.
[00:22:47.371 --> 00:22:49.132]  And now we get the documents.
[00:22:50.103 --> 00:22:53.006]  From former Sheriff Arpaio's task force.
[00:22:53.006 --> 00:22:54.168]  This has all been in federal court.
[00:22:54.168 --> 00:22:55.289]  The feds have had this for two years.
[00:22:55.289 --> 00:22:56.270]  They've been challenged.
[00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.752]  It's all been, you know, secret.
[00:22:57.752 --> 00:22:59.353]  But now it's coming out.
[00:22:59.353 --> 00:23:02.117]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[00:23:03.075 --> 00:23:07.799]  Going back with Obama eight years, oh and guess who else is in there?
[00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.280]  Alex Jones.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.822]  So they say they've never spied on anybody, Roger Stone.
[00:23:11.822 --> 00:23:16.986]  New York Times admits CIA affirms it's spied on the Senate Intelligence Panel.
[00:23:16.986 --> 00:23:21.470]  They admit that this very program called Dragnet was used on over a million Americans.
[00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.553]  Well now we have the Dragnet interface, I mean the Dragnet entries.
[00:23:25.993 --> 00:23:30.139]  And we've also got a bunch of the raw front page files given to us by law enforcement that show it.
[00:23:30.139 --> 00:23:31.842]  And notice, how big is it, Roger?
[00:23:31.842 --> 00:23:33.785]  You can tweet an hour later it's national news.
[00:23:33.785 --> 00:23:34.406]  Me too.
[00:23:34.406 --> 00:23:41.036]  They are dead silent on this, even though DrugsReport.com has it linked right dead center since yesterday afternoon.
[00:23:41.036 --> 00:23:41.596]  What's that tell you?
[00:23:42.308 --> 00:23:45.651]  Let's be very clear that these are related issues.
[00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:47.893]  The timeline you just went through... Oh, it's all together!
[00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:49.334]  It's the same thing!
[00:23:49.334 --> 00:23:49.935]  Exactly.
[00:23:49.935 --> 00:23:51.456]  But here's the important thing to realize.
[00:23:51.456 --> 00:23:56.140]  As soon as Donald Trump tweeted on his personal Twitter feed that he had been wiretapped...
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.663]  The intelligence agency's rap changed overnight to, we have no evidence.
[00:24:02.663 --> 00:24:08.025]  Up until then, they had all kinds of secret evidence, as they kept telling the New York Times.
[00:24:08.025 --> 00:24:09.226]  They're busted.
[00:24:09.226 --> 00:24:10.327]  They're caught.
[00:24:10.327 --> 00:24:11.987]  They want this all to go away.
[00:24:11.987 --> 00:24:12.408]  Think about it.
[00:24:12.408 --> 00:24:12.788]  Think about it.
[00:24:12.788 --> 00:24:14.489]  They're saying they're going to impeach Trump.
[00:24:14.489 --> 00:24:15.389]  This is unbelievable.
[00:24:15.389 --> 00:24:17.590]  Talk about over-the-top, con-game gaslighting.
[00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.891]  They're going to impeach Trump.
[00:24:19.471 --> 00:24:22.053]  When they're saying, we were surveilling your people and have proof.
[00:24:22.053 --> 00:24:24.755]  He says, that's a leak, you shouldn't talk about intelligence.
[00:24:24.755 --> 00:24:25.836]  They're caught.
[00:24:25.836 --> 00:24:32.762]  So then, they turn around and say, oh, we were never surveilling, you're insane, when we have thousands of newspaper headlines and them saying it on TV.
[00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:33.923]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:24:33.923 --> 00:24:40.629]  Let me speak specifically to this groundbreaking story by Jerry Corsi today about widespread spying.
[00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:43.690]  Put aside Sheriff Joe for a moment.
[00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:56.758]  We now know from these documents that through a program of wide data collection that Donald Trump's home phone number in his New York apartment was being monitored.
[00:24:56.758 --> 00:25:00.940]  His office phone number at Trump Tower was being monitored.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.922]  His cell phones were being monitored.
[00:25:03.922 --> 00:25:07.884]  His the number in his private apartment in Mar-a-Lago in Palm
[00:25:08.004 --> 00:25:13.870]  By the way, these are numbers all known to us, you and I, so we know these are the real numbers.
[00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:19.056]  And then the numbers at his various resorts where he would go to play golf.
[00:25:19.056 --> 00:25:22.299]  All of them had been monitored.
[00:25:22.299 --> 00:25:24.962]  All of them had been compromised.
[00:25:24.962 --> 00:25:28.566]  They had begun this under President Bush, but here is the key.
[00:25:28.566 --> 00:25:29.166]  The program
[00:25:30.027 --> 00:25:35.251]  Uh, which, uh, which, uh, had several different iterations of code names.
[00:25:35.251 --> 00:25:40.674]  Trump, I think his data was swept up under a task force called Sidewinder.
[00:25:40.674 --> 00:25:47.559]  Uh, was, uh, that monitoring, that surveillance continued into the Obama administration.
[00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:50.641]  So the question becomes not when did it start?
[00:25:50.641 --> 00:25:53.322]  The real question is, when did it stop?
[00:25:53.322 --> 00:25:54.663]  Or did it stop?
[00:25:54.663 --> 00:25:55.324]  I still believe
[00:25:56.024 --> 00:26:06.967]  That Judge Napolitano is absolutely right that the piece pertaining to Trump was probably done by the Brits.
[00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:08.227]  They're the cutout.
[00:26:08.227 --> 00:26:14.348]  Their denial today is what they're supposed to be saying as the cutout.
[00:26:14.348 --> 00:26:16.949]  This is how intelligence works.
[00:26:16.949 --> 00:26:21.090]  So in order to be able to say we didn't do this with a straight face,
[00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.051]  They franchised it out to the Brits.
[00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:28.172]  Trust me, we've done the same for them in other jurisdictions.
[00:26:28.172 --> 00:26:29.072]  And that's how this works.
[00:26:29.072 --> 00:26:32.513]  Well, I've been butting in here because this is all interconnected.
[00:26:32.513 --> 00:26:40.796]  It's incredible to see my name in here, my old private office that we had to get out of because of people starting to surveil it.
[00:26:40.796 --> 00:26:42.556]  Just all sorts of things going on.
[00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:47.878]  And then to know these are real and to see them not even responding, Roger,
[00:26:48.638 --> 00:26:51.840]  I mean, I had investigators calling me last week saying, is this your old cell phone number?
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.160]  Yes.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.700]  Your private one.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.221]  Is this where you had your private office?
[00:26:54.221 --> 00:26:55.122]  Yes.
[00:26:55.122 --> 00:26:56.303]  Is this where you used to live?
[00:26:56.303 --> 00:26:57.263]  Yes.
[00:26:57.263 --> 00:26:58.704]  Is this your family's phone number?
[00:26:58.704 --> 00:26:59.424]  Yes.
[00:26:59.424 --> 00:27:02.926]  Is this where you also, I mean, they had me surveilled all over the place.
[00:27:02.926 --> 00:27:05.748]  And again, let's remember, because Trump was against the Iraq war.
[00:27:05.748 --> 00:27:08.890]  He was talking about running against George W. Bush in 2004.
[00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.611]  So they're surveilling him.
[00:27:10.611 --> 00:27:11.792]  It continues under Obama.
[00:27:12.677 --> 00:27:14.058]  And this is incredible.
[00:27:14.058 --> 00:27:14.759]  So here it is.
[00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:19.182]  Proof Obama was surveilling him a lot longer than we thought.
[00:27:19.182 --> 00:27:22.725]  And just zero coverage because they don't know what to do.
[00:27:22.725 --> 00:27:26.348]  So it's key that the listeners get this out if they want to defeat the globalists.
[00:27:26.348 --> 00:27:27.749]  Roger Stone.
[00:27:27.749 --> 00:27:33.614]  Alex, the truth is in 2000, when I was the chairman of Donald Trump's Presidential Exploratory Committee,
[00:27:34.443 --> 00:27:45.670]  I kept finding an enormous amount of our continued documents, not documents, but information contained in our proprietary online material in the media.
[00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.051]  Constantly in the media.
[00:27:47.051 --> 00:28:00.220]  I suspect that even then, surveillance we went so far as to have one of the hotel rooms or one of the sections of Mar-a-Lago swept.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.142]  This was in 2000.
[00:28:03.142 --> 00:28:05.684]  So I have always seen this danger.
[00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:07.805]  This is bigger than Watergate.
[00:28:07.805 --> 00:28:11.288]  This will ultimately bring the criminals down.
[00:28:11.288 --> 00:28:16.371]  Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus don't have the belly for this fight.
[00:28:16.371 --> 00:28:20.234]  They're saying, oh, Mr. President, walk it back.
[00:28:20.234 --> 00:28:21.535]  Apologize.
[00:28:21.535 --> 00:28:24.897]  Sure, they tried to walk it back and said he walked it back to the presidency.
[00:28:24.897 --> 00:28:25.898]  He said, no, I didn't.
[00:28:25.898 --> 00:28:28.360]  Because it's known they spy on us to get around the law.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:28.880]  We spy on them.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.121]  It's an agreement that's admitted.
[00:28:30.802 --> 00:28:35.527]  Well, and his joke at the swearing-in of Merkel tells you what he thinks.
[00:28:35.527 --> 00:28:36.768]  What did he say?
[00:28:36.768 --> 00:28:47.538]  One thing that Chancellor Merkel and I have in common is we've both been wiretapped by Barack Obama.
[00:28:47.538 --> 00:28:49.180]  Right on the money.
[00:28:50.575 --> 00:28:51.336]  That's right, Roger.
[00:28:51.336 --> 00:28:54.338]  I know you've got to go very, very soon for more interviews.
[00:28:54.338 --> 00:28:55.499]  Thank you for the exclusive.
[00:28:55.499 --> 00:29:02.104]  As you know more, you're going to be popping in at, what, 1.30 Central and that's 2.30 Eastern, correct?
[00:29:02.104 --> 00:29:03.385]  Yes, we've got a couple.
[00:29:03.385 --> 00:29:09.790]  We have a couple of camera crews that we have at bay from the local affiliates.
[00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:17.556]  And I want to make clear to them, just as I make clear to the InfoWars family, I am ready to testify.
[00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:17.937]  Bring it!
[00:29:19.181 --> 00:29:21.606]  Again, total made-up crap bull.
[00:29:31.266 --> 00:29:35.188]  We'll prove that there was no Russian collusion.
[00:29:35.188 --> 00:29:35.848]  All right.
[00:29:35.848 --> 00:29:36.829]  Thank you so much, Roger.
[00:29:36.829 --> 00:29:38.029]  Be safe, because I wanted to say this.
[00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:41.070]  You know they're going to try to kill you before these hearings.
[00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.971]  They're trying to kill you.
[00:29:41.971 --> 00:29:43.271]  You need real security.
[00:29:43.271 --> 00:29:45.713]  I've got people ready to come in from Florida if you need help.
[00:29:45.713 --> 00:29:46.353]  So let's talk.
[00:29:46.353 --> 00:29:47.773]  God bless you.
[00:29:47.773 --> 00:29:48.894]  This is serious, folks.
[00:29:48.894 --> 00:29:49.654]  This isn't drama.
[00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:51.955]  Roger, you want to come back and say two more things?
[00:29:51.955 --> 00:29:52.355]  You got to go.
[00:29:52.355 --> 00:29:53.536]  You got to go with the camera, Chris.
[00:29:53.536 --> 00:29:54.136]  No, I'm good.
[00:29:54.136 --> 00:29:55.897]  All right, thank you.
[00:29:55.897 --> 00:29:56.998]  Be safe, man.
[00:29:56.998 --> 00:29:57.338]  Be safe.
[00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:07.713]  The House Intelligence Committee hearing today on Russia and the 2016 elections has been quite the fake news, anti-Trump, double standard ceremony.
[00:30:07.713 --> 00:30:13.336]  Led by the anti-Trump team of Schiff, Comey, and Nunes, the 2020 Globalist Democrat campaign for U.S.
[00:30:13.336 --> 00:30:14.577]  President has begun.
[00:30:14.577 --> 00:30:19.680]  Admiral Rogers of the NSA could not answer many questions due to national security and classified information.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.081]  The hearing was loaded with canned questions, responses, and lawyer talk.
[00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:27.624]  The Trump-Russia narrative echoed with, there was no wiretapping, attacks peppered in.
[00:30:27.884 --> 00:30:28.904]  So now, U.S.
[00:30:28.904 --> 00:30:38.628]  officials are discussing the investigation of Russian influence on the Trump campaign and the election, but at the same time attacking Trump for claiming he was being investigated by the U.S.
[00:30:38.628 --> 00:30:40.269]  government during these investigations.
[00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:41.569]  1984 doublethink in the flesh.
[00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.571]  Understand this.
[00:30:44.571 --> 00:30:49.094]  This hearing and all other related hearings or narratives are nothing more than the globalist Democrat U.S.
[00:30:49.094 --> 00:30:50.275]  presidential campaign for 2020.
[00:30:50.275 --> 00:30:57.059]  They will try to delegitimize President Trump with fake news, then attack him on it the entire 2020 campaign.
[00:30:57.059 --> 00:30:59.301]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:31:00.031 --> 00:31:00.852]  Hey, everyone!
[00:31:00.852 --> 00:31:06.996]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:06.996 --> 00:31:09.058]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:09.058 --> 00:31:19.346]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:19.346 --> 00:31:25.331]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:25.791 --> 00:31:40.708]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:31:40.748 --> 00:31:41.328]  I think so.
[00:32:00.086 --> 00:32:01.907]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:01.907 --> 00:32:08.510]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.671]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:11.671 --> 00:32:21.455]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:21.455 --> 00:32:22.296]  Caveman.
[00:32:22.296 --> 00:32:27.358]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:27.358 --> 00:32:29.479]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:29.779 --> 00:32:32.920]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:38.080]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:46.102]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:46.102 --> 00:32:54.003]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:54.003 --> 00:32:58.804]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[00:33:02.387 --> 00:33:05.029]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:14.556]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:14.556 --> 00:33:17.378]  It just went live.
[00:33:17.378 --> 00:33:18.118]  Bombshell!
[00:33:18.118 --> 00:33:23.022]  Obama's NSA illegally spied on Sheriff Arpaio's prosecution.
[00:33:23.022 --> 00:33:29.987]  They've got the documents, the surveillance, Arpaio's house, his office, all of it spied on and used in the federal court.
[00:33:30.797 --> 00:33:33.678]  Again, Sheriff Arpaio, they're trying to put in prison.
[00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:34.578]  Wow.
[00:33:34.578 --> 00:33:40.700]  Former federal officer, long-serving, decorated sheriff, patriot.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:46.441]  Obama trying to put him in prison, using the spy grid to try to make up garbage.
[00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:49.102]  And guess who else is in the database?
[00:33:49.102 --> 00:33:51.523]  Yours truly.
[00:33:51.523 --> 00:33:54.004]  Isn't that just special?
[00:33:54.004 --> 00:33:57.225]  Yeah, I guess there's a who's who of the patriots in there.
[00:33:57.225 --> 00:33:58.745]  Kind of want to get on that list, don't you?
[00:34:02.714 --> 00:34:10.196]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, criminals in this government that have hijacked it at many levels think they own you and your family.
[00:34:10.196 --> 00:34:18.258]  From their perspective, they can try to claim that what Detective Zula and what Arpaio and others are putting out here was illegal because it's secret.
[00:34:18.258 --> 00:34:21.118]  This was all brought to them years ago in federal court.
[00:34:21.118 --> 00:34:22.098]  They ignored it.
[00:34:22.098 --> 00:34:28.440]  And this is only sort of coming after Arpaio even harder because they knew he had the whistleblower that had all this information.
[00:34:33.214 --> 00:34:48.443]  Now, we're going to have, in just a moment, joining us, Dr. Corsi, then we have the detective joining us as well, who just does this of his own accord, great patriot, been through a lot, Mike Zullo.
[00:34:48.443 --> 00:34:56.067]  So he's coming up at the start of the next hour, then David Horowitz is coming on, he's talking about the sellout to the Islamicists, and then Roger Stone is popping back in, the David Knight.
[00:34:56.067 --> 00:34:59.989]  We'll host the fourth hour with a lot of the latest, obviously from the Comey hearings that are ongoing.
[00:34:59.989 --> 00:35:02.111]  And I'm going to get to the Comey hearings.
[00:35:03.635 --> 00:35:05.897]  And some other clips here in just a moment.
[00:35:05.897 --> 00:35:15.004]  Before I go any further, I get in such heated focus going after these people on air that I skip network breaks.
[00:35:15.004 --> 00:35:17.306]  I don't even plug hardly.
[00:35:17.306 --> 00:35:28.736]  And we need to be able to expand in the face of this, not just stay the same size, but they're doing all sorts of things to govern us back, to strangle us, our reach, to block our sponsorships that we do have.
[00:35:30.299 --> 00:35:33.501]  That's why I moved away from sponsors years ago, because they can be gotten after.
[00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:33.822]  Threatened.
[00:35:33.822 --> 00:35:41.207]  I mean, I'd have it in a bit with Willie Nelson for veterans, you know, and firefighters exposing that the government was working with Islam in 9-11.
[00:35:41.207 --> 00:35:44.570]  They'd bomb threat it and they'd shut it down.
[00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.371]  This is the stuff you deal with.
[00:35:46.371 --> 00:35:51.135]  So, we direct sell high quality products to you to fund our operation.
[00:35:51.135 --> 00:35:53.977]  So, we've got the best water filtration systems, the widest selection.
[00:35:55.185 --> 00:36:03.609]  We have the best new nanotech, but also Kevlar patented body armor at the lowest prices out there.
[00:36:03.609 --> 00:36:04.790]  And folks know we're under attack.
[00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:12.173]  That's how we're able to get exclusives on Citizens, Nanotech and Defender Kevlar for rifles and handguns that nobody else can get.
[00:36:12.173 --> 00:36:21.558]  I mean, we're the exclusive when it comes to the nanotech because people know inside these groups and development groups what's really going on, how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:36:21.558 --> 00:36:24.319]  So the great thing is when the enemy closes doors, other doors open.
[00:36:25.834 --> 00:36:30.550]  But believe me, they put a knot on our head lately.
[00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.874]  They've certainly been having an effect.
[00:36:34.352 --> 00:36:37.553]  I get so heated, I don't even do the plugging I should do to fund ourselves to begin with.
[00:36:37.553 --> 00:36:43.294]  So, you need to go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and you need to order high-quality products.
[00:36:43.294 --> 00:36:49.795]  We're doing 30% off the highest quality My Patriot Supply Foods, the private label, InfoWars Select.
[00:36:49.795 --> 00:36:52.115]  It's their whole line of foods.
[00:36:52.115 --> 00:36:56.256]  It's super high quality, made in America, produced fresh.
[00:36:56.256 --> 00:37:01.877]  30 to 40% off, excuse me, we used to do this only once a year, but with North Korea threatening to nuke the United States and all the craziness going on.
[00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.992]  This is insurance you can eat, and with the inflation, this is obviously going to happen.
[00:37:05.992 --> 00:37:12.015]  This is the way the world works, especially as the economy heats back up and you get a job.
[00:37:12.015 --> 00:37:15.757]  This is the kind of insurance you can eat if things go south, if they kill Trump, whatever happens.
[00:37:15.757 --> 00:37:18.538]  I think now, it's more important than ever to have storable food.
[00:37:18.538 --> 00:37:21.019]  30-40% off, we're only doing this for two days.
[00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:23.721]  We're going to end the sale today on Super Metal Vitality, 30% off as well.
[00:37:24.943 --> 00:37:29.745]  Whether it's a Trump-Pence 2020 shirt, everybody should wear these shirts at least once a week out with their family.
[00:37:29.745 --> 00:37:33.787]  Because Trump is just an absolute crusader for freedom.
[00:37:33.787 --> 00:37:35.607]  He's got such strength.
[00:37:35.607 --> 00:37:36.448]  He's so honorable.
[00:37:36.448 --> 00:37:38.709]  He's doing such a good job for the people.
[00:37:38.709 --> 00:37:41.010]  I don't mean to gush, but I just tell the truth.
[00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:41.750]  He's just a champion.
[00:37:42.588 --> 00:37:48.132]  And they're trying to pull him down right now with these lies about Russian connections and fake Gallup polls.
[00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:50.053]  He's down to 37 percent.
[00:37:50.053 --> 00:37:54.637]  When I look at the big corporate polls, the internal internet polls show he's at about 65 percent.
[00:37:54.637 --> 00:37:58.039]  He's super popular right now, except with weak-minded people.
[00:37:58.039 --> 00:38:01.221]  Just like I told you during the election, he had way better polls than they were showing.
[00:38:01.221 --> 00:38:01.942]  It wasn't hard.
[00:38:01.942 --> 00:38:07.766]  The methodology is they add 10 to 15 to 20 to 40 plus points in some of these polls against Trump.
[00:38:08.848 --> 00:38:11.110]  Don't look at the methodology on the new Gallup poll.
[00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.712]  It's the demographics and the phone numbers they're calling.
[00:38:13.712 --> 00:38:18.116]  They've gotten past results from them and they're people that do polls.
[00:38:18.116 --> 00:38:22.800]  So it's totally skewed to look like we can bring down the president.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.442]  To make it look like the globalists can destroy him.
[00:38:26.229 --> 00:38:31.851]  So, the President needs your prayers and support, and the outlet's fighting for the President.
[00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:35.233]  I mean, we are openly listed by Media Matters and other groups to be destroyed and brought down.
[00:38:35.233 --> 00:38:36.353]  Remember Cass Sunstein?
[00:38:36.353 --> 00:38:39.475]  I was reminded of that when he first got in under Obama eight years ago.
[00:38:39.475 --> 00:38:41.456]  He said, we're going to infiltrate the media and destroy them.
[00:38:41.456 --> 00:38:43.516]  We're going to oppose his liberty groups and cause infighting.
[00:38:43.516 --> 00:38:48.839]  And we're going to put taxes on, quote, conspiracy theories and questioning the government.
[00:38:48.839 --> 00:38:50.880]  We're going to go after, quote, fake news.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.680]  They're doing it now.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.981]  Anything that's real, they call fake.
[00:38:55.407 --> 00:38:58.648]  Notice, they will not respond.
[00:38:58.648 --> 00:39:11.774]  Ladies and gentlemen, close to 24 hours in, from the top link, top left-hand side of Drudge, right in the middle column on DrudgeReport.com, NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[00:39:11.774 --> 00:39:19.077]  Bombshell discovery shows targets of NSA Project Dragnet.
[00:39:19.077 --> 00:39:20.938]  Who else is going to bring you this information?
[00:39:20.938 --> 00:39:21.298]  Nobody.
[00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:32.614]  And quite frankly, I don't get off on the fact that Trump comes out and says, you watch next week, the evidence of the wiretap is going to come out by Obama against American citizens.
[00:39:32.614 --> 00:39:33.874]  And I sort of get phone calls.
[00:39:33.874 --> 00:39:35.195]  Is this your old cell phone number?
[00:39:35.195 --> 00:39:36.536]  Is this your old office number?
[00:39:36.536 --> 00:39:37.796]  I'm like, yeah.
[00:39:37.796 --> 00:39:38.657]  We're like, well, get ready.
[00:39:38.657 --> 00:39:43.719]  You're in an NSA database that shows you've been under heavy surveillance with the president, with Arpaio and others.
[00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:48.590]  It gets put out.
[00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.232]  This is from Sheriff Arpaio's investigations.
[00:39:51.232 --> 00:39:55.615]  This has been in federal court, by the way, for two years.
[00:39:55.615 --> 00:39:57.156]  And nothing.
[00:39:57.156 --> 00:39:58.076]  Silence.
[00:39:58.076 --> 00:40:02.399]  And that's when you know you got big, big, big, big information.
[00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:05.381]  It's when the corporate press doesn't even attack it, doesn't even spin it.
[00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:07.863]  Now they're sitting around figuring out how to punch holes in it.
[00:40:09.138 --> 00:40:12.782]  But we've got them admitting the parallel construction in Reuters and AP.
[00:40:12.782 --> 00:40:15.705]  We've got them admitting that they were already targeting their political enemies.
[00:40:15.705 --> 00:40:16.867]  Remember?
[00:40:16.867 --> 00:40:20.150]  Roger Stone had a FISA open on him.
[00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:21.772]  They said they were surveilling Trump.
[00:40:21.772 --> 00:40:23.234]  And they said, oh no, we weren't.
[00:40:23.234 --> 00:40:27.298]  When it turned out there was nothing there and he pointed out, you just leaked that you had me under surveillance.
[00:40:27.298 --> 00:40:28.159]  He's got them either way.
[00:40:29.131 --> 00:40:30.732]  He's got them to say leak surveillance?
[00:40:30.732 --> 00:40:32.453]  Turns out though there's nothing in the surveillance.
[00:40:32.453 --> 00:40:33.194]  So what do they say?
[00:40:33.194 --> 00:40:39.378]  We didn't surveil anybody even though they were in thousands of headlines for the New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:40:39.378 --> 00:40:51.066]  We found one writer, Rosenberg, four times the week of January 20th, four times saying this.
[00:40:51.066 --> 00:40:55.109]  And of course we pointed out and then CNN goes, oh my God, Alex Jones is so crazy.
[00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:57.510]  He put this out and then Trump picks it up and tweeted it.
[00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.031]  No, he didn't.
[00:40:59.619 --> 00:41:02.180]  That's one thing Trump doesn't do is a lot of screenshots of headlines.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.641]  He should have done that in his tweets.
[00:41:03.641 --> 00:41:06.683]  Or had a link to WhiteHouse.gov where he puts his own articles.
[00:41:06.683 --> 00:41:09.244]  Where he shows, because they just say, oh he's crazy, see his tweet?
[00:41:09.244 --> 00:41:10.045]  Where's the proof?
[00:41:10.045 --> 00:41:15.428]  In some lawyer game, like the tweet itself is the compendium of information.
[00:41:15.428 --> 00:41:16.148]  This is so huge.
[00:41:16.148 --> 00:41:17.789]  You've got to go to DrudgeReport.com.
[00:41:17.789 --> 00:41:20.650]  You've got to get it out to everyone you know.
[00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.973]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com and get the new article that just broke 15 minutes ago.
[00:41:26.516 --> 00:41:28.118]  Yeah, Matthew Rosenberg.
[00:41:28.118 --> 00:41:29.500]  Obama!
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:35.950]  Obama's NSA illegally spied on Sheriff Arpaio's prosecution.
[00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:40.957]  Draw parallels to Obama's wiretapping of Trump.
[00:41:40.957 --> 00:41:41.518]  Absolutely.
[00:41:48.487 --> 00:41:50.448]  And that's actually Corsi's note.
[00:41:50.448 --> 00:41:53.050]  We're moving so fast here on the deal.
[00:41:53.050 --> 00:42:00.134]  My note back to him that I wanted to add a section to it about tying it to the, it's all part of the larger Dragnet operation.
[00:42:00.134 --> 00:42:01.955]  And also we have a new operation we've learned of.
[00:42:01.955 --> 00:42:03.376]  We're going to be giving you more in the next few days.
[00:42:03.376 --> 00:42:05.857]  Operation Sidewinder.
[00:42:05.857 --> 00:42:10.140]  So they brag everybody's under surveillance.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.140]  Trump speaks out against it.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.221]  They go, you're insane.
[00:42:12.221 --> 00:42:13.501]  There's no such thing.
[00:42:13.501 --> 00:42:15.823]  Just like they say, you can keep your Dr. Obamacare's free.
[00:42:18.183 --> 00:42:20.185]  You didn't build that business.
[00:42:20.185 --> 00:42:22.087]  Somebody else did it.
[00:42:22.087 --> 00:42:23.529]  I never said that, Obama.
[00:42:23.529 --> 00:42:25.771]  I never said you could keep your doctor.
[00:42:25.771 --> 00:42:28.575]  I never said you didn't build your business.
[00:42:28.575 --> 00:42:29.035]  Gruber!
[00:42:29.035 --> 00:42:30.216]  Thank God the public's so dumb!
[00:42:30.216 --> 00:42:31.318]  Remember him?
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.063]  And Trump is so responsive, I told the audience two weeks ago.
[00:42:38.063 --> 00:42:39.304]  Tweet at Trump!
[00:42:39.304 --> 00:42:43.068]  Tell him to bring up Gruber again to remind folks about healthcare and how they're scamming us.
[00:42:43.068 --> 00:42:43.908]  Trump does it.
[00:42:43.908 --> 00:42:45.129]  He's responsive, folks.
[00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:46.891]  He's listening to you, not just me.
[00:42:46.891 --> 00:42:50.755]  We're going to Dr. Corsi right now, but this story is so important.
[00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:53.472]  Up on Infowars.com.
[00:42:53.472 --> 00:42:56.614]  We've got it linked to the story that's linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:42:56.614 --> 00:43:05.080]  And I gotta tell you, who's the only other big outlet that isn't cowardly or who isn't so competitive they won't give another news organization attention?
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:10.184]  I could care less about getting this scoop for myself.
[00:43:10.184 --> 00:43:11.825]  For the country, I totally care.
[00:43:11.825 --> 00:43:14.226]  I would love it if it was Breitbart or WorldNet Daily.
[00:43:14.226 --> 00:43:15.427]  I would love it!
[00:43:15.427 --> 00:43:15.768]  Okay?
[00:43:15.768 --> 00:43:18.589]  I'm not competitive with other news outlets.
[00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:19.930]  I want to defeat the globalists.
[00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:20.251]  I'm in a
[00:43:21.647 --> 00:43:22.387]  Total war!
[00:43:22.387 --> 00:43:25.388]  A death battle, as they call it.
[00:43:25.388 --> 00:43:26.969]  I said six months ago it's a death battle.
[00:43:26.969 --> 00:43:27.669]  Now they use that term.
[00:43:27.669 --> 00:43:30.570]  They go, we're in a death battle with Trump and the Nationalists.
[00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:33.331]  Yes, they're not going to back off.
[00:43:33.331 --> 00:43:36.533]  They're not going to let us operate and live, folks, politically.
[00:43:36.533 --> 00:43:37.993]  They mean business.
[00:43:37.993 --> 00:43:39.414]  They think that we're winning.
[00:43:39.414 --> 00:43:40.254]  They're panicked.
[00:43:40.254 --> 00:43:42.255]  We're now seeing their full attack.
[00:43:42.255 --> 00:43:44.335]  We break them now.
[00:43:44.335 --> 00:43:46.616]  We break them for a long time.
[00:43:46.616 --> 00:43:49.177]  This is the critical juncture.
[00:43:49.177 --> 00:43:50.818]  So let's recap what happened yesterday.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:44:12.967]  Let's recap what happened yesterday, and recap that, to give them credit, Newsmax and Larry Klayman, who's been at the center of this, I'm going to get Klayman on as soon as possible, they're the ones that got the documents, and then they were able to interface them with Arpaio, that show all this, and they've got a report on the whistleblower himself, it's like another Snowden, he was a contractor.
[00:44:12.967 --> 00:44:15.288]  So I need that info, I had it last night, I need it.
[00:44:15.288 --> 00:44:20.150]  If you don't know where it is, just go to yesterday's interview with Zulo, he talks about it the first two minutes.
[00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.810]  I need it bad.
[00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.331]  I need it uber bad.
[00:44:23.052 --> 00:44:38.699]  Now, going to Dr. Corsi, formerly of WorldNetDaily, great outfit as well, three-time, number one New York Times bestseller, author, award-winning investigative journalist, Harvard expert, of course, on finance and more, State Department, anti-terrorism.
[00:44:38.699 --> 00:44:39.719]  We'll just leave it at that.
[00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:44.801]  Dr. Corsi, I've never in my 22 years, it's never been such a whirlwind of breaking info.
[00:44:44.801 --> 00:44:48.423]  In the real media, this is a firestorm, but outside of it, zero crickets.
[00:44:49.704 --> 00:45:01.221]  Well, first of all, what we did last night in terms of showing that Donald Trump was wiretapped starting in 2004 and producing that evidence has gone viral.
[00:45:01.221 --> 00:45:02.704]  Now, the mainstream media, I think, is really
[00:45:03.859 --> 00:45:08.621]  At a loss for how to respond to this because it beats their narrative.
[00:45:08.621 --> 00:45:13.142]  The phones, the phone numbers on that list are authentic.
[00:45:13.142 --> 00:45:19.985]  There are phone numbers including Donald Trump's cell phone, his employees, his family, his wife was being wiretapped.
[00:45:19.985 --> 00:45:25.067]  This all comes from Operation Dragnet, which was an NSA operation.
[00:45:25.067 --> 00:45:27.187]  I think it's still probably going on.
[00:45:27.187 --> 00:45:28.548]  I don't know if they ever really ended it.
[00:45:29.378 --> 00:45:29.798]  I think so.
[00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:49.331]  Call me, FBI Director.
[00:45:49.331 --> 00:45:53.796]  Well, in fact, was Donald Trump wiretapped in this period of time?
[00:45:53.796 --> 00:45:55.637]  Call me to have to say yes, of course.
[00:45:55.637 --> 00:45:56.719]  You didn't ask me that question.
[00:45:56.719 --> 00:45:59.141]  You just asked me if Obama ordered it.
[00:45:59.141 --> 00:46:06.509]  Well, you know, Obama not ordering it is kind of like the Watergate defense when Richard Nixon said I didn't order the break-in.
[00:46:07.049 --> 00:46:23.504]  You know, he still was impeached because he, uh, was in the process of being impeached because he, you know, did not and would not, fess up to his responsibility for encouraging his operatives to wiretap- That's right, let's be clear, that's key.
[00:46:23.504 --> 00:46:26.007]  The Republicans and Democrats are all out to get Trump up there.
[00:46:26.007 --> 00:46:29.410]  They're all parsing words and prescriptive stuff is coming, it's totally clear.
[00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:32.533]  Giving him the softball questions to get out of the, uh, answering truthfully.
[00:46:33.407 --> 00:46:36.371]  Yeah, it's truthfully disinformation.
[00:46:36.371 --> 00:46:44.523]  Because Comey knows that Trump was wiretapped, and extensively since 2004, that it went on during the Obama administration.
[00:46:44.523 --> 00:46:46.085]  We have no indication it ever quit.
[00:46:46.826 --> 00:46:55.631]  Now that we have Trump's cell phone numbers, his family numbers, his employee numbers, all these different locations, it's a farce.
[00:46:55.631 --> 00:46:57.632]  And Comey knows it's a farce.
[00:46:57.632 --> 00:47:11.380]  What they won't do is they won't expose the fact there's massive illegal activity that's been going on in the NSA and in the Department of Justice over wiretapping and other surveillance of individual Americans.
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.701]  Millions and millions.
[00:47:13.161 --> 00:47:22.611]  With the data collected, not just metadata, but the data collected at conversations, emails, financial records, credit card records.
[00:47:22.611 --> 00:47:24.553]  Sure, and let me expose this as well.
[00:47:24.553 --> 00:47:29.779]  Newsmax, Larry Klayman, New Nesmas has FBI's coming about Montgomery mass surveillance case.
[00:47:31.107 --> 00:47:33.188]  That's what was brought to Arpaio and others.
[00:47:33.188 --> 00:47:34.609]  That's where the documents come from.
[00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:35.950]  We've checked the numbers, checked it all.
[00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:42.193]  It is an NSA system, similar to the ones they're using in the DEA, with access to the NSA database.
[00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:58.923]  That all came out in the parallel production, parallel structuring cases, where they are pretending like they're not illegally spying via the NSA, and then going and parallel construction, creating new fake cases based on the illegally
[00:48:00.063 --> 00:48:00.784]  I think so.
[00:48:17.475 --> 00:48:19.417]  And also, look, what we have on today, the new article we just broke,
[00:48:35.874 --> 00:48:44.880]  Well, we have, in fact, today we're able to publish the phone numbers and the IP addresses because this document was made public in a federal court.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:49.863]  And by the way, no one in the federal government has ever come by to repudiate this.
[00:48:49.863 --> 00:48:52.524]  It's been offered to say, please prove this is false.
[00:48:52.524 --> 00:48:53.245]  They haven't done it.
[00:48:53.245 --> 00:48:58.228]  They haven't done it with the database from Montgomery that we revealed yesterday.
[00:48:58.228 --> 00:49:04.252]  Now, what this shows is the Department of Justice, when they were prosecuting Sheriff Arpaio,
[00:49:04.952 --> 00:49:08.796]  We're also wiretapping and talking to the judge.
[00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:23.130]  Well, again, this is all was created.
[00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:30.215]  What they did is they asked Montgomery to basically reconstruct, go in and reconstruct what was happening in the case.
[00:49:30.215 --> 00:49:34.698]  And this was put together by the same whistleblower who said, you want to know what's happening?
[00:49:34.698 --> 00:49:36.979]  The DOJ is talking to the judge.
[00:49:36.979 --> 00:49:39.241]  Here are the phone numbers that are being used.
[00:49:39.241 --> 00:49:44.865]  You can see the phone numbers from Washington calling the Department of Justice into the judge's office.
[00:49:45.465 --> 00:49:47.946]  I defy anybody to show those aren't the right numbers.
[00:49:47.946 --> 00:49:50.846]  And then you've got the IP addresses.
[00:49:50.846 --> 00:49:59.668]  You've got Department of Justice put on wiretap number 56990-34 block 6029204000.
[00:49:59.668 --> 00:50:05.030]  Well, that's Arpaio's phone numbers right there.
[00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:11.191]  And then they breach all domains and subdomains of Maricopa government with Maricopa County government
[00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:14.772]  The sheriff's office and you've got the IP addresses 1.5.42.184.18.
[00:50:14.772 --> 00:50:20.934]  Now this information has been available.
[00:50:20.934 --> 00:50:25.036]  We were the first to really publish it when you introduced in federal court.
[00:50:25.908 --> 00:50:30.672]  And the Department of Justice and the NSA have never come back and said this is not true.
[00:50:30.672 --> 00:50:39.840]  And what it shows is that while the Department of Justice, and by the way, this prosecution was brought by Tom Perez, who's a La Raza operative.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:45.805]  So we've got La Raza operatives basically tied into this whole situation, NSA databases, you name it.
[00:50:45.805 --> 00:50:47.887]  Imagine what Hitler would have done with this type of technology.
[00:50:47.887 --> 00:50:48.368]  Stay there, Doc.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.720]  Doc, we gotta go to break.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.281]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:52.301]  I don't think you can hear me.
[00:50:52.301 --> 00:50:54.522]  We'll be right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:50:54.522 --> 00:50:54.962]  Stay with us.
[00:50:54.962 --> 00:50:55.742]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:55.742 --> 00:50:56.742]  Tell everybody you know to tune in.
[00:50:56.742 --> 00:50:59.643]  They don't want you to hear this.
[00:50:59.643 --> 00:51:01.004]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[00:51:01.004 --> 00:51:04.285]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[00:51:04.285 --> 00:51:05.825]  The world is in turmoil.
[00:51:05.825 --> 00:51:10.347]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[00:51:10.347 --> 00:51:13.468]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[00:51:13.468 --> 00:51:17.109]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:21.851]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[00:51:21.851 --> 00:51:24.733]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[00:51:24.733 --> 00:51:28.435]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[00:51:28.435 --> 00:51:30.956]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[00:51:30.956 --> 00:51:34.558]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:39.721]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat, and it lasts up to 25 years.
[00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:41.782]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[00:51:41.782 --> 00:51:45.824]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.

[00:53:59.927 --> 00:54:11.132]  As far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps.
[00:54:28.615 --> 00:54:33.980]  That's right, Obama ordered tapping of her personally, her personal phone, her home, all of it.
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.202]  No one ever taps anybody.
[00:54:36.202 --> 00:54:43.289]  This is like living in a lunatic asylum with this paradox of we're informed, we know what's going on.
[00:54:43.289 --> 00:54:48.314]  Thousands of articles admitting Trump was being surveilled, the documents he was being surveilled.
[00:54:48.314 --> 00:54:50.215]  Back to the first year Obama was in office.
[00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:59.474]  They're doing all this, and they're just acting like none of it's happening and saying we're insane.
[00:54:59.474 --> 00:55:01.556]  The audience is really informed, okay?
[00:55:01.556 --> 00:55:03.938]  So I'm gonna ask Dr. Corsi, what do you think we do?
[00:55:03.938 --> 00:55:06.661]  I mean, obviously, Drudge is linked to the story.
[00:55:06.661 --> 00:55:11.285]  Second biggest site in the world, largest news site in the world, okay?
[00:55:11.285 --> 00:55:12.006]  That came out last week.
[00:55:12.006 --> 00:55:14.088]  It's the second biggest website in the world, after MSN.
[00:55:15.396 --> 00:55:16.397]  And he's linked to it.
[00:55:16.397 --> 00:55:17.337]  Millions have already read it.
[00:55:17.337 --> 00:55:21.159]  I looked, there's over a million as of this morning have gone on the story and read it.
[00:55:21.159 --> 00:55:22.160]  Nowhere in the news.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.761]  Normally, you know, they analyze everything we say, everything we do.
[00:55:24.761 --> 00:55:28.243]  They will not touch it with a 10-foot pole because they know this has been in federal court.
[00:55:28.243 --> 00:55:30.724]  They know the feds have admitted in federal court these are real.
[00:55:30.724 --> 00:55:32.085]  And they said no.
[00:55:32.085 --> 00:55:34.306]  Because we talked to the investigators that were involved.
[00:55:34.306 --> 00:55:38.568]  So we have got them with their pants down around their ankles, hand in the cookie jar.
[00:55:39.991 --> 00:55:44.435]  I think first of all the mainstream media does not know how to handle this information.
[00:55:44.435 --> 00:55:45.076]  We're publishing it.
[00:56:04.918 --> 00:56:24.203]  And if it's been out there in federal court, it's, you know, the especially today with this timeline of intervening and judge tampering with the DOJ, wiretapping, while the court was going on, Tom Perez was behind this case in the Department of Labor.
[00:56:24.203 --> 00:56:25.504]  He's now head of the DNC.
[00:56:26.747 --> 00:56:28.769]  He's the guy they just elected as the head of the DNC.
[00:56:28.769 --> 00:56:30.030]  He's LaRosa.
[00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:31.772]  He went after our pile.
[00:56:31.772 --> 00:56:36.236]  While he was there, he and Eric Holder, they spoke to the judges.
[00:56:36.236 --> 00:56:38.038]  They wiretapped the judges.
[00:56:38.038 --> 00:56:40.620]  They were wiretapped calling the judges.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.482]  The NSA came in.
[00:56:42.482 --> 00:56:44.604]  We've even got the wiretapped number.
[00:56:44.604 --> 00:56:46.105]  We've got the verification.
[00:56:46.105 --> 00:56:50.129]  It was Sheriff Arpaio's cell phones and his other office phones.
[00:56:50.629 --> 00:56:54.653]  We've got the IP addresses for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department office.
[00:56:54.653 --> 00:57:03.482]  Now, if this was not true, you know, certainly in the last several years, the federal government would have come out and repudiated all this.
[00:57:03.482 --> 00:57:04.603]  They haven't.
[00:57:04.603 --> 00:57:07.886]  And we beg them, say, if this is not true, prove it's wrong.
[00:57:07.886 --> 00:57:09.187]  But they gotta prove it's wrong.
[00:57:09.187 --> 00:57:10.608]  We got permission from Arpaio.
[00:57:10.608 --> 00:57:11.930]  We're getting some feedback there.
[00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:13.551]  We got some permission from Arpaio.
[00:57:14.412 --> 00:57:15.353]  To be able to put this out.
[00:57:15.353 --> 00:57:19.058]  This is his home numbers, office numbers, family, IP addresses.
[00:57:19.058 --> 00:57:20.519]  This is Arpaio's stuff.
[00:57:20.519 --> 00:57:23.483]  And this is what he was being surveilled in the case.
[00:57:23.483 --> 00:57:25.025]  You talk about illegal on so many fronts.
[00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:26.967]  This is bombshell.
[00:57:26.967 --> 00:57:28.549]  I don't know how they're going to ignore this.
[00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:30.471]  And Arpaio can certainly sue over all this.
[00:57:30.471 --> 00:57:32.394]  They're trying to put him in prison right now for contempt.
[00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:38.435]  And I think what we've been doing, I've been making sure the White House has been informed of this every step of the way.
[00:57:38.435 --> 00:57:43.280]  The White House has seen Trump's phone numbers that are on the operation.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:46.883]  Now let's be clear, before we ever published, you called, they checked, the President was shown.
[00:57:46.883 --> 00:57:48.125]  He's like, yeah, that's my numbers.
[00:57:48.125 --> 00:57:50.928]  I mean, I know, I've got, I've got all three of these numbers.
[00:57:51.772 --> 00:57:54.354]  And we're going to make sure they see, you know, the article of the day.
[00:57:54.354 --> 00:57:56.535]  I'm going to make sure they see the timelines.
[00:57:56.535 --> 00:57:58.056]  Make sure they have all in the White House.
[00:57:58.056 --> 00:58:00.658]  Make sure the top aides have seen all this.
[00:58:00.658 --> 00:58:07.622]  And then we're talking with Congress, key members of Congress, to make sure this gets in front of congressional investigations.
[00:58:07.622 --> 00:58:11.224]  And finally, it's got to get to Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General.
[00:58:11.224 --> 00:58:13.806]  So, you know, Sheriff Arpaio has said over and over again
[00:58:14.286 --> 00:58:16.548]  He wants to come and testify in Congress.
[00:58:16.548 --> 00:58:19.391]  He wants to share this information with the Department of Justice.
[00:58:19.391 --> 00:58:23.694]  And all the Department of Justice does, all the FBI does, is stonewall.
[00:58:23.694 --> 00:58:28.378]  They send Comey up there and Comey says, um, there's no evidence of President Obama.
[00:58:28.378 --> 00:58:31.081]  Sure, but the problem is they all brag they were spying on Trump.
[00:58:31.081 --> 00:58:32.942]  We got them on TV and in print.
[00:58:32.942 --> 00:58:34.304]  And then now they're trying to back off of that.
[00:58:34.304 --> 00:58:36.586]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with Dr. Corsi.
[00:58:36.586 --> 00:58:38.227]  And we have the detective coming on with all this.
[00:58:38.227 --> 00:58:39.368]  This is huge, folks.
[00:58:39.368 --> 00:58:40.169]  If you get this out,
[00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:42.274]  It is a major blow against the enemy.
[00:58:42.274 --> 00:58:43.216]  It's up to you.

[00:58:50.091 --> 00:58:57.553]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:58:57.553 --> 00:59:10.756]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:59:11.696 --> 00:59:23.606]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:59:23.606 --> 00:59:29.571]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[00:59:30.311 --> 00:59:39.335]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[00:59:39.335 --> 00:59:51.902]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:59:51.902 --> 00:59:54.563]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.879 --> 01:00:13.061]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:13.061 --> 01:00:13.501]  Wow.
[01:00:13.501 --> 01:00:24.952]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:00:24.952 --> 01:00:29.236]  Well, it's high noon Central Time, Texas time.
[01:00:29.236 --> 01:00:33.500]  When that sun is high in that Texas sky, I'll be bucking at the county fair.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.923]  And I'll be here on the air.
[01:00:40.709 --> 01:00:44.412]  It is surreal to know that we have memories.
[01:00:44.412 --> 01:00:49.857]  We remember them saying they were surveilling Trump and his people, and they had all the evidence, they had the transcripts, and then Trump said, that's illegal to leak that!
[01:00:49.857 --> 01:00:58.584]  And they went, oh, we don't actually, well, we have the transcripts, but there's no evidence you're Russian, so let's just not worry about that for a minute.
[01:00:58.584 --> 01:01:00.206]  And then he goes, yeah, and you're wiretapping me.
[01:01:00.206 --> 01:01:01.827]  And they go, oh, no, no, no.
[01:01:03.766 --> 01:01:08.411]  This is such a big deal, and then every news channel is, boy, Trump got caught, he's an idiot!
[01:01:08.411 --> 01:01:10.794]  Everybody knows nobody's getting listened to in America.
[01:01:10.794 --> 01:01:13.536]  Look at Conway, she says appliances are listening to you.
[01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:16.039]  That's only been in about 5,000 newspapers over the years.
[01:01:16.039 --> 01:01:20.364]  Of course, we broke it.
[01:01:20.364 --> 01:01:22.706]  Yes, Infowars first broke it 12 years ago.
[01:01:22.706 --> 01:01:23.167]  We're on record.
[01:01:24.244 --> 01:01:26.885]  In fact, they even say, look at the crazy Alex Jones!
[01:01:26.885 --> 01:01:28.306]  He was the first one to say this.
[01:01:28.306 --> 01:01:47.797]  Yeah, because Google put out an internal press release with stockholders about how they were listening to folks in their houses and creating a database of the text, creating a text document, and then selling, advertising, targeting you specifically off what's going on in your house.
[01:01:51.087 --> 01:01:52.228]  And so here we are, though.
[01:01:52.228 --> 01:01:54.929]  Trump's this big idiot, according to them.
[01:01:54.929 --> 01:01:56.650]  Dr. Corsi, we're going to hold you over a little bit.
[01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:58.011]  This is a short segment.
[01:01:58.011 --> 01:02:00.532]  What do you make, though, of this just mass attempt?
[01:02:00.532 --> 01:02:04.014]  They're clearly going after him, saying it's impeachable and all this other crap.
[01:02:04.014 --> 01:02:04.995]  What should the president do?
[01:02:04.995 --> 01:02:06.556]  Do you agree he should get on the offense?
[01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:09.077]  Sessions is starting to clear out the Justice Department.
[01:02:09.077 --> 01:02:10.078]  It's not political.
[01:02:10.078 --> 01:02:11.418]  These are criminals coming after him.
[01:02:11.418 --> 01:02:12.819]  They've committed illegal spying.
[01:02:12.819 --> 01:02:13.880]  They've done all these horrible things.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.081]  They're trying to destroy him.
[01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:17.522]  I mean, the president has got to go after him.
[01:02:18.479 --> 01:02:20.121]  Gotta go after them.
[01:02:20.121 --> 01:02:30.531]  President Trump has gotta make it clear that he knows he's been under surveillance and the proof is in this database, this Operation Dragnet database.
[01:02:30.531 --> 01:02:41.902]  He's gotta go and help Sheriff Arpaio get a hearing with the Justice Department before they criminally convict him of contempt in a trial
[01:02:42.648 --> 01:02:48.034]  That the DOJ did, again, illegal interfering judge tampering.
[01:02:48.034 --> 01:02:50.656]  Talk about a mistrial by every law out there now.
[01:02:50.656 --> 01:02:53.039]  It's got to be a new trial.
[01:02:53.039 --> 01:02:54.160]  It's got to be a new trial.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:03:02.208]  And the people in the Department of Justice, including Tom Perez, who's head of the DNC, former La Raza, needs to be brought to justice.
[01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:05.332]  He was so determined to convict Arpaio.
[01:03:06.044 --> 01:03:25.736]  That they had the NSA, the DOJ wiretap the judge while they were calling the judge and talking to the judge during the trial, working behind the scenes to have all the emails captured at the NSA, the IP addresses, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, wiretapping
[01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:43.872]  And again, another contractor that's involved with the telecoms NSA brought all this to them two years ago, the detectives coming on.
[01:03:43.872 --> 01:03:45.493]  This has even been brought up and they don't care.
[01:03:45.493 --> 01:03:50.137]  They're just moving forward even though they have the evidence, the numbers, how they did it all.
[01:03:50.137 --> 01:03:50.718]  Incredible.
[01:03:51.317 --> 01:03:58.279]  With their own lying narrative, their own meme, their own, you know, well, Obama never ordered.
[01:03:58.279 --> 01:03:59.439]  Well, of course he didn't order.
[01:03:59.439 --> 01:04:02.840]  The law says he couldn't order any more than Nixon ordered.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.741]  They're playing legalese games.
[01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:07.882]  Yeah, I did not have sex with that woman.
[01:04:07.882 --> 01:04:09.742]  You know, that's one of those games.
[01:04:09.742 --> 01:04:14.504]  Yeah, because fellatio isn't the act of courts.
[01:04:14.504 --> 01:04:15.324]  Exactly.
[01:04:15.324 --> 01:04:17.064]  And that's the distinctions they're trying to draw.
[01:04:17.064 --> 01:04:18.785]  And so if you say to Comey, well,
[01:04:19.454 --> 01:04:22.255]  You know, was Trump ever wiretapped?
[01:04:22.255 --> 01:04:25.197]  Oh yeah, well, yes of course, but you didn't ask me that question.
[01:04:25.197 --> 01:04:35.442]  That's the kind of nonsense, you know, and that's the complete corruption at the heart of the FBI, at the heart of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch's Department of Justice.
[01:04:35.442 --> 01:04:40.885]  The total arrogance that she would sit there and meet on an airplane with Bill Clinton during a criminal investigation, it just shows the wantonness.
[01:04:40.885 --> 01:04:45.107]  So if Trump just does his duty, if Sessions just does his duty,
[01:04:46.112 --> 01:04:48.154]  Then these people are going to be in big trouble.
[01:04:48.154 --> 01:04:51.238]  Let's talk about how that plays out with Detective Zullo.
[01:04:51.238 --> 01:04:51.799]  Straight ahead.
[01:04:51.799 --> 01:04:53.200]  Stay with us a little bit more.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.122]  Doc, I know you have some more stories to work on.
[01:04:55.122 --> 01:04:55.863]  RemfordWars.com.
[01:04:55.863 --> 01:04:57.565]  That's our Washington Bureau Chief right there.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.383]  Robo Bezos!
[01:05:03.383 --> 01:05:09.208]  The CIA-affiliated owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, donned a robo suit straight out of Avatar.
[01:05:09.208 --> 01:05:15.534]  Bezos hopped in the pilot seat of the 13-foot mobile hunk of metal with arms and legs, mimicking those of a human's.
[01:05:15.534 --> 01:05:20.198]  He smiled for the cameras and said with a smile, Bow down before your new king and master!
[01:05:20.638 --> 01:05:25.919]  The robot he was operating is the Method 2, built by the South Korean company Hankook Marae.
[01:05:25.919 --> 01:05:30.820]  It operates with two joysticks to control the arms, and leg pedals to control the legs.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:38.581]  The robot does still need support in order to stand, essentially still in training wheels, but the giant metal puppet is certainly turning heads in the tech industry.
[01:05:38.581 --> 01:05:47.923]  While it is all fun and games for now, keep in mind robot police are now a reality, with more law enforcement, including in the U.S., looking to robot police in the future.
[01:05:48.263 --> 01:05:52.845]  The military has also said it wants to move away from humans and more towards robots.
[01:05:52.845 --> 01:05:55.066]  Is the robo-arms race on?
[01:05:55.066 --> 01:05:59.668]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroeder.
[01:05:59.668 --> 01:06:03.109]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:04.250]  They lost.
[01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:05.550]  We won.
[01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:07.911]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[01:06:07.911 --> 01:06:12.613]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:06:15.586 --> 01:06:21.428]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:06:21.428 --> 01:06:33.852]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:06:33.852 --> 01:06:36.293]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:06:36.573 --> 01:06:37.753]  We're the solution.
[01:06:37.753 --> 01:06:38.734]  Americans.
[01:06:38.734 --> 01:06:40.274]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:06:40.274 --> 01:06:45.655]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:06:45.655 --> 01:06:47.316]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:06:47.316 --> 01:06:49.236]  DVDs now available.
[01:06:49.236 --> 01:06:52.657]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:06:52.657 --> 01:06:55.418]  Americans need to see this film.
[01:06:55.418 --> 01:06:56.398]  Revelation.
[01:06:56.398 --> 01:06:56.978]  The movie.
[01:06:56.978 --> 01:06:58.138]  .info.
[01:06:58.138 --> 01:07:02.519]  Let's fix it.
[01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:03.920]  Let's go to Dabit in Florida.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.760]  Dabit in Florida.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.220]  You're on the air.
[01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:06.621]  Great!
[01:07:06.621 --> 01:07:07.741]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:07:07.741 --> 01:07:12.262]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:21.544]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:07:21.544 --> 01:07:22.424]  Wow, thank you.
[01:07:22.424 --> 01:07:24.765]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:07:24.765 --> 01:07:26.605]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[01:07:26.605 --> 01:07:30.066]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[01:07:30.066 --> 01:07:30.486]  That's amazing.
[01:07:30.486 --> 01:07:31.327]  It's really incredible.
[01:07:31.327 --> 01:07:34.730]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:35.750]  I haven't felt this week.
[01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.412]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:07:37.412 --> 01:07:38.673]  And I love you guys.
[01:07:38.673 --> 01:07:40.815]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[01:07:40.815 --> 01:07:47.681]  And I just want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:07:47.681 --> 01:07:48.722]  You will love it.
[01:07:48.722 --> 01:07:49.222]  I'm telling you.
[01:07:49.222 --> 01:07:50.843]  I've never bought a bad product.
[01:07:50.843 --> 01:07:55.287]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:07:55.287 --> 01:07:56.168]  It's a win-win.
[01:07:56.168 --> 01:07:57.129]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:08:10.438 --> 01:08:16.681]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.948 --> 01:08:23.750]  Welcome back to the second hour.
[01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:26.852]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to shift gears and get into the big news.
[01:08:26.852 --> 01:08:28.774]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:08:28.774 --> 01:08:29.995]  Global war approaches.
[01:08:29.995 --> 01:08:31.337]  North Korea warns.
[01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:38.804]  If a single bullet is fired, we will take matters into our own hands and we'll nuke the United States of America.
[01:08:38.804 --> 01:08:42.107]  And they've got nuclear weapons thanks to our government giving it to them.
[01:08:42.107 --> 01:08:43.128]  I haven't gotten to this yet.
[01:08:43.128 --> 01:08:46.111]  I don't like to celebrate people's deaths, but I gotta tell you, he was evil.
[01:08:47.585 --> 01:08:49.326]  Global is David Rockefeller, dead at 101.
[01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:53.650]  And I'll give it to him, nobody in the family ever made it past 100.
[01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:59.414]  Not John Dee, the first, none of them.
[01:08:59.414 --> 01:09:03.577]  Now, of course, he's getting a really important phone call right now, so he can take his time.
[01:09:03.577 --> 01:09:09.882]  We'll go back to him in a moment.
[01:09:09.882 --> 01:09:14.646]  We've got Mike Zulo that we're getting lined up via Skype as well, but we're gonna be getting into
[01:09:16.232 --> 01:09:18.033]  All this news and more.
[01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:29.576]  Every day I see so many stories I can't keep track of, more than 15 or so, it's conservative, where Muslims are beating people up in Europe for drinking beer at outdoor cafes or eating ham or eating pizza with sausage on it.
[01:09:29.576 --> 01:09:31.077]  Here's another one today.
[01:09:31.077 --> 01:09:33.998]  Muslim gang attacks Danish couple for eating ham on pizza.
[01:09:36.963 --> 01:09:39.844]  I mean, it's just getting crazier and crazier.
[01:09:39.844 --> 01:09:49.509]  We also have more clips where Congressman Nunes, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, says, we've had months to look at these records and everything, the metadata, the surveillance, and there's nothing.
[01:09:49.509 --> 01:09:52.470]  There's no Russian connection to Trump.
[01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:54.471]  But how do you have data if he wasn't being surveilled?
[01:09:54.471 --> 01:09:56.292]  They don't call it wiretapping.
[01:09:56.292 --> 01:10:00.554]  That's an arcane term to go into a copper wire.
[01:10:00.554 --> 01:10:02.675]  So they've been playing games with all of that.
[01:10:03.919 --> 01:10:05.379]  This is such a big deal, though.
[01:10:05.379 --> 01:10:10.301]  The second part of the series that Dr. Corsi put up today, published at Infowars.com.
[01:10:10.301 --> 01:10:13.502]  NSA document proves surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:18.023]  Bombshell discovery shows targets of NSA Project Dragnet.
[01:10:18.023 --> 01:10:22.404]  Here's a Larry Klaman article, that's the guy that founded Judicial Watch, at Newsmax.
[01:10:22.404 --> 01:10:28.586]  Nunes must ask FBI, that's the House Intelligence Committee head again, must ask FBI to tell me about Montgomery.
[01:10:29.901 --> 01:10:40.684]  Mass surveillance case and that's the case given to Arpaio that the feds haven't denied with a 47 hard drives over 60 million pages of information.
[01:10:40.684 --> 01:10:41.724]  Much bigger than Snowden.
[01:10:41.724 --> 01:10:47.685]  I mean this is the super Snowden.
[01:10:47.685 --> 01:10:50.446]  The super Snowden leaks show Obama
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.422]  Spied on Trump, Alex Jones, Sara Farpaio.
[01:10:55.422 --> 01:10:56.182]  It's all there.
[01:10:56.182 --> 01:10:57.403]  How sensational!
[01:10:57.403 --> 01:11:06.188]  Drudge, the biggest news site in the world, rated the second biggest website in the world, period, has had this link since yesterday at 4 o'clock.
[01:11:06.188 --> 01:11:10.470]  Guys, search engine Alex Jones, click Google or search engine NSA, whatever.
[01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:13.291]  As of Showtime, I've seen nothing on this.
[01:11:13.291 --> 01:11:14.392]  I've never seen that.
[01:11:14.392 --> 01:11:16.693]  Total blackout.
[01:11:16.693 --> 01:11:17.914]  They don't know how to respond.
[01:11:17.914 --> 01:11:20.095]  Let me tell you, these phone numbers,
[01:11:22.657 --> 01:11:27.121]  These private phone numbers, his private apartment at Mar-a-Lago and all that?
[01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:29.783]  These are the numbers.
[01:11:29.783 --> 01:11:31.224]  My old cell phone number nobody had?
[01:11:31.224 --> 01:11:31.905]  That's real.
[01:11:31.905 --> 01:11:32.746]  My old private office?
[01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:34.727]  That's real.
[01:11:34.727 --> 01:11:37.750]  All these numbers?
[01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:38.651]  Real.
[01:11:38.651 --> 01:11:39.331]  This is real.
[01:11:39.331 --> 01:11:40.232]  They already know that.
[01:11:40.232 --> 01:11:41.313]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:11:41.313 --> 01:11:45.837]  They're running around saying, to the whole world, Trump's insane, no one ever surveilled you.
[01:11:46.889 --> 01:12:02.881]  When they were in the news, four times, one writer, Matthew Rosenberg, the week of the inauguration, saying, we have the surveillance, we have the transcripts, we have Trump, we have Roger Stone, we have General Flynn, and all they have is General Flynn on the phone with the Russians lining up the phone call, and the House says, no, that's Bull.
[01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:07.465]  We have all the headlines, wiretapped data, we can show it to you all day long.
[01:12:09.172 --> 01:12:13.113]  Then they go on CNN Thursday and say I'm crazier Friday.
[01:12:13.113 --> 01:12:14.434]  None of this is real.
[01:12:14.434 --> 01:12:15.674]  None of this is happening.
[01:12:15.674 --> 01:12:19.336]  Alex Jones made this up.
[01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:20.596]  Alex Jones made this up.
[01:12:20.596 --> 01:12:22.157]  They also say I'm a flat earther.
[01:12:22.157 --> 01:12:23.577]  I've debunked all that crap.
[01:12:23.577 --> 01:12:24.798]  But that's what they do, folks.
[01:12:24.798 --> 01:12:26.719]  They make up things I've never said.
[01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:27.479]  Straw man.
[01:12:27.479 --> 01:12:29.640]  They say Donald Trump doesn't like Hispanics.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.280]  Totally made up.
[01:12:33.186 --> 01:12:41.848]  Now, I want to go to Detective Zulo, who is just a great patriot, done so much work on the cold case policy, and also has worked in New Jersey, but he doesn't want any thanks.
[01:12:41.848 --> 01:12:48.669]  He wants to stop this, and they're trying to put Arpaio in prison right now, as you know, and that's the second part of this bombshell report.
[01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:50.329]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:12:50.329 --> 01:12:52.970]  It needs to go out everywhere.
[01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:57.631]  Obama's NSA illegally spied on Sheriff Arpaio's prosecution.
[01:12:57.631 --> 01:12:58.611]  Total and complete
[01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:09.195]  Discovery shows targets of NSA's Project Dragnet, and now Stone says he has info on something called Sidewinder.
[01:13:09.195 --> 01:13:13.457]  So what's going to happen is, folks, Trump's going to strike back, and so are patriots in the government, so just get ready.
[01:13:13.457 --> 01:13:20.502]  They want to play hardball with all this made-up crap and claim they're surveilling, and Trump goes, OK, well, it's a leak that you're surveilling is illegal.
[01:13:20.502 --> 01:13:21.643]  Oh, no, we never surveilled!
[01:13:21.643 --> 01:13:22.904]  And then play that game, it's not going to work.
[01:13:22.904 --> 01:13:29.768]  So I want to ask Mike Zullo what he thinks about all this, working this case for so long,
[01:13:30.809 --> 01:13:36.091]  And what his gut tells him is going on here because it's like total lies from them.
[01:13:36.091 --> 01:13:37.432]  Totally crazy.
[01:13:37.432 --> 01:13:39.113]  This is such amazing news.
[01:13:39.113 --> 01:13:42.034]  And it's not like we need MSM to pick this up for it to be big.
[01:13:42.034 --> 01:13:44.355]  Normally they ridicule and twist everything we say.
[01:13:44.355 --> 01:13:47.536]  I mean we're talking a hundred articles a day attacking us.
[01:13:47.536 --> 01:13:48.536]  Zero on this.
[01:13:48.536 --> 01:13:50.077]  That shows how scared they are.
[01:13:50.077 --> 01:13:51.278]  They're running scared.
[01:13:51.278 --> 01:13:52.758]  Mike?
[01:13:52.758 --> 01:13:53.799]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:13:53.799 --> 01:13:54.639]  Good friend.
[01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:55.679]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:56.680]  What an amazing time to be alive.
[01:13:59.351 --> 01:14:03.595]  Yeah, I guess you could look at it like that.
[01:14:03.595 --> 01:14:09.700]  You know, to put it in a nutshell, to address the question you just asked, we really don't know what is going on.
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:17.567]  We know that we made every endeavor to bring Mr. Montgomery, his information, to federal authorities.
[01:14:17.567 --> 01:14:18.488]  Like I said earlier,
[01:14:19.949 --> 01:14:30.695]  We contacted Larry Klayman for his assistance, and under the direction of Sheriff Arpaio, we brought Mr. Montgomery to Judge Royce Lamberth, who used to be the head of the FISA Court.
[01:14:30.695 --> 01:14:36.899]  Judge Lamberth was the FISA judge that authorized the Bin Laden wiretaps in his living room at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[01:14:38.047 --> 01:14:39.609]  And we got him there.
[01:14:39.609 --> 01:14:44.813]  The dilemma was for all involved is where do we go with this?
[01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:53.500]  Mr. Montgomery, during his tenure as a contractor, the FBI, and this is in court documents, had illegally
[01:14:54.511 --> 01:14:56.753]  Executed a search warrant on his home.
[01:14:56.753 --> 01:14:59.295]  With fabricated affidavits to a judge.
[01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:03.139]  And that was all bared out in a trial.
[01:15:03.139 --> 01:15:07.743]  He did not, for obvious reasons, trust the FBI or want to work with the FBI.
[01:15:07.743 --> 01:15:09.645]  That posed a problem for us.
[01:15:09.645 --> 01:15:14.049]  Because the only other place we could have gone to at that time would have been the Department of Justice.
[01:15:14.049 --> 01:15:16.491]  And I believe at that time it was still Eric Holder.
[01:15:16.491 --> 01:15:18.052]  That was a problem.
[01:15:18.052 --> 01:15:19.353]  We didn't know where to take it.
[01:15:20.533 --> 01:15:30.023]  As this unfolded, Larry Klayman was successful in persuading Mr. Montgomery to talk to the FBI, which he did.
[01:15:30.023 --> 01:15:41.776]  My understanding, you'll have to clarify this with Larry, is Mr. Montgomery brought in a sampling of some documentation that the FBI vetted
[01:15:43.024 --> 01:15:48.169]  In return, they contacted him and gave him what is known as production immunity.
[01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:53.113]  And he brought in, I believe it was like 600 million records.
[01:15:53.113 --> 01:15:59.438]  He provided them that information, some time goes by, and they called him back and they gave him testimonial immunity.
[01:15:59.438 --> 01:16:00.759]  That's right, it's reported.
[01:16:00.759 --> 01:16:04.302]  47 hard drives, 60 million pages of information.
[01:16:05.316 --> 01:16:06.758]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[01:16:06.758 --> 01:16:09.541]  This is way bigger than anything WikiLeaks or Snowden ever had.
[01:16:09.541 --> 01:16:10.622]  And now we're checking the data.
[01:16:10.622 --> 01:16:11.263]  It's all real.
[01:16:11.263 --> 01:16:12.724]  There's no way this guy had this.
[01:16:12.724 --> 01:16:13.866]  These are real databases.
[01:16:14.841 --> 01:16:17.922]  Well, and you know, that's the perplexing part of all of this.
[01:16:17.922 --> 01:16:23.245]  This was exposed in a civil proceeding as a side issue.
[01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:26.106]  It was put out there in the public.
[01:16:26.106 --> 01:16:30.908]  Information that was gathered was turned over to plaintiff's attorneys.
[01:16:30.908 --> 01:16:33.089]  It was turned over in open court.
[01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.050]  It was put on... By the way, I was just corrected.
[01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:36.891]  I apologize, Detective.
[01:16:36.891 --> 01:16:38.251]  It was $600 million.
[01:16:38.251 --> 01:16:40.232]  Excuse me, $600 million.
[01:16:40.232 --> 01:16:40.893]  I misspoke.
[01:16:40.893 --> 01:16:41.113]  Go ahead.
[01:16:41.909 --> 01:16:44.610]  Yeah, it was put out there for the world to see.
[01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:55.815]  The documentation you have now was actually leaked by ACLU attorneys to the press out here in Phoenix, one particular left-hard-leaning publication.
[01:16:55.815 --> 01:17:02.278]  I had recorded conversations with Mr. Montgomery in our very first meetings with him because we didn't know him.
[01:17:02.278 --> 01:17:03.439]  We didn't know if he was even real.
[01:17:04.439 --> 01:17:04.540]  Wow.
[01:17:15.695 --> 01:17:18.617]  This information was turned over at that point in time.
[01:17:18.617 --> 01:17:23.320]  My understanding is Mr. Montgomery brought information that he did not share with us.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.363]  And I want your audience to understand what we were trying to accomplish.
[01:17:26.363 --> 01:17:28.864]  We were not looking for classified information.
[01:17:28.864 --> 01:17:35.749]  What we were trying to do was validate some of the claims of Montgomery through the civilian side of this.
[01:17:35.749 --> 01:17:39.492]  In other words, you claim you have this civilian information, let us vet it.
[01:17:39.972 --> 01:17:40.693]  Let us find out.
[01:17:40.693 --> 01:17:46.721]  So you spot check different info randomly that he obviously, you know, you know, can't just go and guess what you're going to spot check and what'd you find?
[01:17:48.119 --> 01:17:58.746]  The personal information on a lot of the 151,000 people was absolutely correct, although none of them can identify the bank accounts that were alleged to be theirs.
[01:17:58.746 --> 01:18:07.111]  That gets to be very interesting, because those bank accounts, it is suspected that they are actually fraudulent transactions.
[01:18:07.111 --> 01:18:14.095]  Every one of those bank accounts had accounts in it with high speculative real estate, gas and oil stock plays.
[01:18:14.415 --> 01:18:18.557]  So we're talking about a lot of derivative, speculative things being done in other people's names.
[01:18:18.557 --> 01:18:19.457]  Correct.
[01:18:19.457 --> 01:18:20.537]  Correct.
[01:18:20.537 --> 01:18:22.178]  That's all been turned over.
[01:18:22.178 --> 01:18:25.099]  Everything involving this case has been turned over.
[01:18:25.099 --> 01:18:29.661]  And for two years now since Mr. Klayman brought him to the federal authorities, the FBI,
[01:18:30.521 --> 01:18:31.402]  We have heard nothing.
[01:18:31.402 --> 01:18:37.006]  Nobody has said that this information is garbage, and nobody has said it's creditable.
[01:18:37.006 --> 01:18:43.872]  So we don't know, as within our jurisdictional powers, we don't have the jurisdiction to further this.
[01:18:43.872 --> 01:18:45.513]  This had to be done on a federal level.
[01:18:46.514 --> 01:18:48.315]  And that's where it stands today.
[01:18:48.315 --> 01:18:57.301]  What's bringing this to the forefront now is the fact that a lot of stuff that Mr. Montgomery told us, and you have to understand, there are conversations that take place.
[01:18:57.301 --> 01:19:12.330]  Mr. Montgomery had alerted us to things, and I gave you one highlight yesterday of the attorney-client privilege breach that Mr. Snowden did not release for about three or four months after Mr. Montgomery alerted us to this, that start to manifest in the news.
[01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:18.933]  And now today we're seeing a lot of information come out in the news, things that Montgomery told us were going on.
[01:19:18.933 --> 01:19:19.693]  Sure, sure.
[01:19:19.693 --> 01:19:23.514]  Why did Montgomery come to you?
[01:19:23.514 --> 01:19:29.717]  You know, he tried to become a whistleblower, I believe, I could be wrong on the count, it was about a dozen times.
[01:19:29.717 --> 01:19:36.699]  He brought all the correspondence that he tried to go forward with this, and he was shut down at every turn.
[01:19:37.782 --> 01:19:45.484]  And it sounds like this is the one Snowden had first been coming out a few years ago, so probably all that probably added to him wanting to then get it out.
[01:19:46.337 --> 01:19:47.477]  I'm sure it did.
[01:19:47.477 --> 01:19:48.738]  I'm sure it did.
[01:19:48.738 --> 01:19:52.399]  You know, Dennis tried to bring the information forward.
[01:19:52.399 --> 01:19:53.859]  He could not.
[01:19:53.859 --> 01:20:02.461]  When Sheriff Arpaio saw the 151,000 names, he became alarmed because those are 151,000 citizens, let alone his own information is in there.
[01:20:02.461 --> 01:20:05.222]  But that wasn't really what was motivating him.
[01:20:05.222 --> 01:20:10.504]  There are 151,000 citizens, and this is an identity theft case at the very least.
[01:20:10.504 --> 01:20:12.044]  So it needed to be investigated.
[01:20:12.244 --> 01:20:24.112]  But then you look at the names and numbers are matching up, and it's surveillance files, and then you look, Dragnet's an admitted program that was going on that did just this, and it's in the London Guardian, it's in AP, it's in the EFF Foundation.
[01:20:24.112 --> 01:20:25.693]  I mean, this is super creepy.
[01:20:25.693 --> 01:20:33.218]  And again, I talked to Roger because I know three of Trump's numbers, and then I was, a while back, actually got Trump's apartment number, but he's like, yeah, call him.
[01:20:33.218 --> 01:20:34.139]  I never had the nerve to do it.
[01:20:34.139 --> 01:20:36.080]  I just left it alone when he's in Mar-a-Lago.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.602]  But that's the number in there too, to Trump's apartment.
[01:20:38.602 --> 01:20:41.184]  I mean, let me tell you, your guy didn't have Trump's apartment number.
[01:20:42.205 --> 01:20:43.866]  I mean, this is real.
[01:20:43.866 --> 01:20:59.655]  No, Alex, you know, the information is so voluminous and a lot of that information does bear out to be correct that you really have to start to wonder how did any one human being get this unless they were doing something with use of very high-powered, sophisticated computer apparatus.
[01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:00.996]  Well, what did he tell you he was doing?
[01:21:00.996 --> 01:21:03.417]  He did not want to incriminate himself.
[01:21:03.417 --> 01:21:06.139]  Well, I don't want to go into too much of what he said.
[01:21:06.139 --> 01:21:08.460]  He said it was similar to a contractor like Snowden.
[01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:28.814]  Actually, Mr. Montgomery, and this is public, Mr. Montgomery was a contractor who developed the hacking software that could penetrate firewalls of computers, breach them, take over as the administrator, and remain undetected for about an hour and a half, and download whatever they want.
[01:21:30.271 --> 01:21:31.913]  And that's my understanding.
[01:21:31.913 --> 01:21:39.320]  Well, he's, I mean, I'll tell you, these records, and it's from federal databases and matches up with the people we know that have seen this stuff.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.703]  This is a program, and however he got it, this is going on.
[01:21:42.703 --> 01:21:47.667]  And the fact that Trump's in here, I mean, we've got him right there.
[01:21:47.667 --> 01:21:52.351]  But Alex, you know, the troubling part is this was bore out in a federal proceeding.
[01:21:53.294 --> 01:21:54.275]  That's crazy!
[01:21:54.275 --> 01:21:55.636]  Like it's no big deal!
[01:21:55.636 --> 01:21:56.196]  Talk about that!
[01:22:25.515 --> 01:22:27.697]  You judge a tree by its fruits?
[01:22:27.697 --> 01:22:28.217]  Yes.
[01:22:28.217 --> 01:22:38.783]  So, instead of focusing so much on Montgomery and his character or lack thereof, which the government had planted stories, which it's very clear to see that they did, to discredit him.
[01:22:38.783 --> 01:22:47.228]  I mean, listen, they had, last week they had Alec Baldwin get up and say Alex Jones doesn't like black people on Saturday Night Live to discredit him.
[01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:48.108]  I never said that.
[01:22:48.108 --> 01:22:50.530]  That's the level they go to to discredit people they're scared of.
[01:22:51.465 --> 01:22:56.249]  Well, and the fact is, is this information would validate Montgomery's claims.
[01:22:56.249 --> 01:23:07.699]  Everything about Montgomery, everything else about Mr. Montgomery is in the periphery as far as I'm concerned, because you can take the information, if the information is valid 80, 90, 100%, 20%, 30%, then the question becomes, how could you acquire this?
[01:23:12.944 --> 01:23:17.146]  And let's go there in a moment, and of course he's riding a shotgun with us, he can pop him whenever he wants.
[01:23:17.146 --> 01:23:25.191]  Again, Mike Zullo, the hero detective of the Cold Case Posse, the head of that, that just tirelessly donated his years of work to this country.
[01:23:25.191 --> 01:23:26.031]  It's amazing.
[01:23:26.031 --> 01:23:28.872]  I mean, because other folks need to make these sacrifices.
[01:23:28.872 --> 01:23:31.454]  Without Mike, we'd be in even greater trouble.
[01:23:31.454 --> 01:23:32.675]  But again,
[01:23:33.915 --> 01:23:36.438]  We have to ask, now that we have this info, what do we do with it?
[01:23:36.438 --> 01:23:36.998]  Exactly.
[01:23:36.998 --> 01:23:43.083]  They always change the subject about WikiLeaks on to Julian Assange or on to somebody else instead of, it doesn't matter.
[01:23:43.083 --> 01:23:45.506]  They admit this is real, this criminal activity.
[01:23:45.506 --> 01:23:46.066]  Fine.
[01:23:46.066 --> 01:23:49.109]  Just like William Binney, you know, the former head of the NSA said here on air.
[01:23:49.529 --> 01:23:50.149]  Okay, fine.
[01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:56.492]  Charge Snowden with something, but let's charge people a thousand times worse with all the massive crimes going on here that have been proven.
[01:23:56.492 --> 01:23:58.893]  They distract off on, okay, who's this guy?
[01:23:58.893 --> 01:23:59.754]  Oh, they planted a story.
[01:23:59.754 --> 01:24:00.294]  It doesn't matter.
[01:24:00.294 --> 01:24:03.055]  The stuff's real, or almost all of it's real.
[01:24:03.055 --> 01:24:03.896]  What are you going to do?
[01:24:03.896 --> 01:24:06.617]  Because these databases get corrupted, obviously.
[01:24:06.617 --> 01:24:08.098]  What are you going to do with this?
[01:24:08.098 --> 01:24:10.599]  What are you going to do with this information?
[01:24:10.599 --> 01:24:11.699]  Stop changing the subject.
[01:24:11.699 --> 01:24:12.840]  I think that's what you're getting at, Mike.
[01:24:13.479 --> 01:24:18.161]  That is what I'm getting at, and I want to make a big distinction between Montgomery and Snowden.
[01:24:18.161 --> 01:24:20.222]  Montgomery didn't flee the country.
[01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:26.805]  Montgomery has been petitioning to sit and tell somebody what has gone on.
[01:24:26.805 --> 01:24:29.526]  He has been trying- Which is what you're supposed to do under law.
[01:24:29.526 --> 01:24:33.307]  Well, you know, Alex, it's like I don't even understand my country anymore.
[01:24:33.307 --> 01:24:35.148]  None of this makes any sense.
[01:24:35.148 --> 01:24:42.211]  It's pretty bad when a law enforcement officer the caliber of Sheriff Arpaio, a former federal agent,
[01:24:43.502 --> 01:24:48.245]  A sitting judge are in a dilemma as to where do we go?
[01:24:48.245 --> 01:24:50.467]  Because this has gone silent.
[01:24:50.467 --> 01:24:53.709]  And you know, silence usually tells you a lot.
[01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:59.393]  You interview someone, a suspect, and you don't get a direct answer or a lot of big pause, a lot of silence.
[01:24:59.393 --> 01:25:02.035]  Well, you kind of know the answer you're going to get next is going to be a lie.
[01:25:03.246 --> 01:25:06.409]  So, you look at this and you say, wow, everybody wants to be quiet about this.
[01:25:06.409 --> 01:25:09.011]  Everybody just wants to sweep this guy under the rug.
[01:25:09.011 --> 01:25:11.734]  And look, I am not an advocate for Dennis Montgomery.
[01:25:11.734 --> 01:25:15.177]  I know the amount of time and effort Detective Makowicz and I put into this.
[01:25:15.177 --> 01:25:17.459]  I know the time and effort the Sheriff has put into this.
[01:25:17.459 --> 01:25:19.841]  I know the time and effort Larry Klayman has put into this.
[01:25:19.841 --> 01:25:23.624]  And all we're asking is, please, look at this and let us know, is this true?
[01:25:23.624 --> 01:25:24.845]  Because if this is true,
[01:25:25.666 --> 01:25:28.588]  Our problems are far greater than anybody.
[01:25:28.588 --> 01:25:33.912]  And let's not forget, Larry Klayman's the guy that got the big ruling against the NSA that stopped it for three years.
[01:25:33.912 --> 01:25:37.335]  Another incredible hero, and all he gets is demonized.
[01:25:37.335 --> 01:25:40.117]  Nobody wants credit here, that's the funny thing about Klayman or you or anybody.
[01:25:40.117 --> 01:25:44.680]  But, I was asking you how people help you, you're like, nothing, I'm just donating my time and just doing it.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.384]  It's just crazy to know that people like you and Klayman and others out there, I want the audience to understand,
[01:25:50.768 --> 01:25:53.549]  I don't want to get into this because it just gives the enemy, you know, what they want.
[01:25:53.549 --> 01:25:55.850]  But let me tell you, there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:57.611]  They are royal pissed.
[01:25:57.611 --> 01:26:00.112]  All hell's been breaking loose around here since last week.
[01:26:00.112 --> 01:26:02.933]  I'm too busy just doing the show and working every day to pay attention.
[01:26:02.933 --> 01:26:04.313]  I see the reports are coming out.
[01:26:04.313 --> 01:26:05.034]  I know they're coming.
[01:26:05.034 --> 01:26:06.874]  We just put them out and we know they're true.
[01:26:06.874 --> 01:26:09.475]  But believe me, folks, we could not be here next week.
[01:26:09.475 --> 01:26:11.436]  That's how dangerous this is.
[01:26:11.436 --> 01:26:12.136]  Stone could be dead.
[01:26:12.136 --> 01:26:13.197]  They're trying to kill him right now.
[01:26:13.857 --> 01:26:16.958]  They don't want him testifying, they want to make him the bad guy and then kill him.
[01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:21.419]  And I don't want to just get into it all because it's over the top, okay?
[01:26:21.419 --> 01:26:22.919]  It's like a spy movie.
[01:26:22.919 --> 01:26:25.160]  People want Americans to stand up and fight.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.020]  We're here doing it, okay?
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.241]  And I'm not doing it because I'm some hero.
[01:26:28.241 --> 01:26:31.281]  I'm not going to be a slave of these globalist criminals.
[01:26:31.281 --> 01:26:32.382]  My instinct is to fight them.
[01:26:32.382 --> 01:26:32.842]  Just know this.
[01:26:33.542 --> 01:26:36.324]  Trump is up against stuff far worse than the election now.
[01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:37.945]  You want men to fight and women to fight?
[01:26:37.945 --> 01:26:39.246]  We're doing.
[01:26:39.246 --> 01:26:48.453]  And what we need you to do is to pray for us and to get these articles and information out to local talk show hosts, local papers, anybody that's honest, to look at this and to do something about it.
[01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:50.974]  Because if they can get away with this, the sky's the limit.
[01:26:50.974 --> 01:26:52.816]  I mean, listen, they're so arrogant, folks.
[01:26:52.816 --> 01:27:00.021]  They had the CIA director two days before Trump fired him tell him on TV, the president-elect needs to watch his mouth like a gangster.
[01:27:00.561 --> 01:27:02.102]  Mike, and I've got Corsi here, too.
[01:27:02.102 --> 01:27:06.865]  Corsi's polite, but he's got other points, but Mike, other points that are important?
[01:27:06.865 --> 01:27:19.972]  Well, I think, Alex, the other thing that is really, really scary in this whole thing is it appears to me that our federal government, what we recognize as our federal government, is powerless to stop this.
[01:27:21.303 --> 01:27:24.666]  Yeah, Trump's in there, and Sessions is in there, and they're all in mutiny against him.
[01:27:24.666 --> 01:27:26.027]  Do whatever they want!
[01:27:26.027 --> 01:27:29.851]  Well, and there are good people in the CIA, in the NSA, in the FBI.
[01:27:29.851 --> 01:27:33.875]  And, you know, we don't have whistleblower protection laws that truly protect these people.
[01:27:34.773 --> 01:27:42.720]  You know, we don't have any way to have people come forward when this kind of activity is going on, because they're going to be publicly destroyed.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.622]  They're going to be destroyed for their life.
[01:27:44.622 --> 01:27:46.263]  And these people can't come forward.
[01:27:46.263 --> 01:27:49.586]  So look, we have patriots in the NSA, CIA.
[01:27:49.586 --> 01:27:51.488]  My hat is off to those guys.
[01:27:51.488 --> 01:27:57.133]  They do stuff... Sure, the media always acts like we're saying they're all criminals when we bash the high-level... We're not.
[01:27:57.133 --> 01:27:58.654]  They call it controller-level crime.
[01:27:58.654 --> 01:27:59.515]  It's the top people.
[01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:03.049]  That's what it appears to be.
[01:28:03.049 --> 01:28:05.090]  And there are rogue entities within there that are doing this.
[01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:06.331]  Go ahead, Jerry, do you want to say something?
[01:28:06.331 --> 01:28:07.211]  I think I hear you.
[01:28:07.211 --> 01:28:12.114]  I want to say, look, I've worked with Mike now since 2011.
[01:28:12.114 --> 01:28:14.015]  We worked together.
[01:28:14.015 --> 01:28:19.057]  And I want to say that Mike's as honest as they come.
[01:28:19.057 --> 01:28:20.638]  He does not want to be doing this.
[01:28:20.638 --> 01:28:25.781]  I mean, we've been working on this for days and actually a couple of weeks and Mike
[01:28:26.838 --> 01:28:28.219]  It's like, you know, pulling teeth.
[01:28:28.219 --> 01:28:29.920]  He has other things to do.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.241]  He's not even in the sheriff's office anymore.
[01:28:32.241 --> 01:28:35.743]  He has a life to lead and a family to take care of.
[01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:37.964]  He doesn't need to be doing this.
[01:28:37.964 --> 01:28:40.385]  And it takes great courage for him to do it.
[01:28:40.385 --> 01:28:43.387]  I'm telling you, Mike speaks the truth.
[01:28:43.387 --> 01:28:45.308]  It's carefully put together.
[01:28:45.308 --> 01:28:49.049]  He's not going to tell you something is so... Sure, the audience knows that, Dr. Corsi.
[01:28:49.049 --> 01:28:50.650]  So what do we do?
[01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:51.651]  What do we do with this?
[01:28:51.651 --> 01:28:52.911]  This is bombshell.
[01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.592]  Just on our pile, it's over the top.
[01:28:54.592 --> 01:28:55.573]  With Trump, it's over the top.
[01:28:56.112 --> 01:29:09.703]  What I want to do, where I'm, you know, we've got to understand that Sheriff Arpaio has the potential here to go to prison, to go to jail for six months on a trumped up charge where the... And if they can get him, they can get us all.
[01:29:09.703 --> 01:29:11.184]  And we've got to come to his defense.
[01:29:11.184 --> 01:29:21.193]  We've got to demand that Attorney General Sessions look at the malfeasance, the misbehavior, the criminal activity of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch and Tom Perez.
[01:29:22.037 --> 01:29:27.481]  In rigging a prosecution, judge tampering, illegal electronic surveillance.
[01:29:27.481 --> 01:29:29.743]  Well, let's talk about what we do with that and the Trump thing.
[01:29:29.743 --> 01:29:31.404]  You can both do five minutes apiece.
[01:29:31.404 --> 01:29:32.665]  When we come back, we'll let Mike get out of here.
[01:29:32.665 --> 01:29:34.886]  We'll give Mike, like, five minutes final statement on this side of the break.
[01:29:34.886 --> 01:29:38.869]  Then, Dr. Corsi, I'm gonna shift gears to North Korea, threatening to nuke Japan and South Korea.
[01:29:38.869 --> 01:29:40.950]  I mean, it's just, it's unprecedented.
[01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:44.713]  They're actually been loading the missiles, and World War III could break out any minute, too.
[01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:46.054]  This is a crazy time to be alive, folks.
[01:29:48.837 --> 01:29:52.788]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.788 --> 01:29:55.475]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.297 --> 01:30:03.400]  Robo Bezos!
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:09.205]  The CIA-affiliated owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, donned a robo suit straight out of Avatar.
[01:30:09.205 --> 01:30:15.531]  Bezos hopped in the pilot seat of the 13-foot mobile hunk of metal with arms and legs, mimicking those of a human's.
[01:30:15.531 --> 01:30:20.195]  He smiled for the cameras and said with a smile, Bow down before your new king and master!
[01:30:20.635 --> 01:30:25.918]  The robot he was operating is the Method 2, built by the South Korean company Hankook Marae.
[01:30:25.918 --> 01:30:30.841]  It operates with two joysticks to control the arms, and leg pedals to control the legs.
[01:30:30.841 --> 01:30:38.605]  The robot does still need support in order to stand, essentially still in training wheels, but the giant metal puppet is certainly turning heads in the tech industry.
[01:30:38.605 --> 01:30:40.306]  While it is all fun and games for now,
[01:30:40.606 --> 01:30:48.269]  Keep in mind, robot police are now a reality, with more law enforcement, including in the U.S., looking to robot police in the future.
[01:30:48.269 --> 01:30:52.851]  The military has also said it wants to move away from humans and more towards robots.
[01:30:52.851 --> 01:30:55.072]  Is the robo-arms race on?
[01:30:55.072 --> 01:30:57.633]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[01:30:59.761 --> 01:31:01.641]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:31:01.641 --> 01:31:03.682]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:31:03.682 --> 01:31:06.583]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:31:06.583 --> 01:31:12.644]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:31:12.644 --> 01:31:20.006]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[01:31:20.146 --> 01:31:21.828]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:31:21.828 --> 01:31:29.376]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:29.376 --> 01:31:37.405]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:37.405 --> 01:31:38.346]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:39.566 --> 01:31:43.510]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:47.074]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:47.074 --> 01:31:53.801]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:31:53.801 --> 01:31:57.906]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:00.024 --> 01:32:08.007]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:08.007 --> 01:32:14.649]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:32:14.649 --> 01:32:22.952]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:32:23.232 --> 01:32:32.245]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:32:32.245 --> 01:32:37.994]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:32:38.334 --> 01:32:39.095]  It works.
[01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:47.540]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:57.307]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[01:32:57.307 --> 01:32:57.787]  A total 360 win.
[01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:15.193]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.032 --> 01:33:30.415]  As scary as all this is, I'm not up here doing this to scare you.
[01:33:30.415 --> 01:33:37.139]  I always knew when the media would say, oh look at Jones' Fairmonger, or people would also accuse me on the internet, I was trying to scare folks not to be politically involved.
[01:33:37.139 --> 01:33:39.301]  Tell them how dangerous all this is.
[01:33:39.301 --> 01:33:40.342]  But those people don't count.
[01:33:40.342 --> 01:33:41.662]  They're going to be scared of their own shadow.
[01:33:41.662 --> 01:33:43.544]  God bless them.
[01:33:43.544 --> 01:33:47.206]  I'm looking for people that want to hear about the real stuff that's going on, to then organize against it.
[01:33:47.206 --> 01:33:48.687]  We've done that all over the world.
[01:33:48.687 --> 01:33:49.928]  Nationalism's coming back.
[01:33:49.928 --> 01:33:51.229]  The family's coming back.
[01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:52.510]  Christianity's starting to come back.
[01:33:53.718 --> 01:34:04.151]  Good things are happening, but the politicos and the corrupt elites that want monopolies, they are coming down with both feet against nationalists everywhere.
[01:34:04.151 --> 01:34:07.355]  Now I can see globalism if nations work together and it was some type of agreement.
[01:34:07.355 --> 01:34:09.358]  This is like worldwide tyranny.
[01:34:09.358 --> 01:34:10.880]  We've got big developments on that front.
[01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:16.976]  Coming up with the new head of the Globalist, that's definitely, definitely Bill Gates.
[01:34:16.976 --> 01:34:18.897]  David Rockefeller died, of course, yesterday.
[01:34:18.897 --> 01:34:20.658]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:34:20.658 --> 01:34:24.039]  But the new head kingpin is Bill Gates.
[01:34:24.039 --> 01:34:27.841]  I've made a study of it, and he's the head guy right now.
[01:34:27.841 --> 01:34:33.725]  In fact, I mean, there's some big, rich families that meet with him, admittedly, in secret meetings in New York and London.
[01:34:33.725 --> 01:34:36.586]  That's come out even in Associated Press, AP.
[01:34:36.586 --> 01:34:39.288]  We reported it in Endgame before it was in the news.
[01:34:39.288 --> 01:34:41.509]  We had our sources, but it's beyond Bilderberg.
[01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:45.098]  And I've talked to folks that are in those meetings at Bilderberg, their own assistants.
[01:34:45.098 --> 01:34:47.639]  You wonder why would their own assistants come out against them when it's so dangerous?
[01:34:47.639 --> 01:34:50.101]  Because sometimes they kill them.
[01:34:50.101 --> 01:35:05.530]  When you hear the type of crap they're talking about in these meetings... I mean, if Bill Gates says he wants to get rid of 80% of the world population on PBS, what do you think he says in a secret meeting with 150 other world leaders?
[01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:07.291]  And their brainwashing is so bad,
[01:35:08.826 --> 01:35:11.414]  That some of the public are like, well there aren't too many of us.
[01:35:11.414 --> 01:35:12.818]  Well then you kill yourself first!
[01:35:13.561 --> 01:35:16.644]  Don't cut food off the Africans, or put crap in the vaccines.
[01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:18.846]  So that's all coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:23.390]  Mike, I want you to have a chance, and also Dr. Corsi, you know, to have a chance.
[01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:37.763]  But Mike Zullo, again, the former head of the Cole case, posse for Sheriff Arpaio, that Soros, again, the usual suspects, Soros is the number two guy, put all their money, $30-something million against, and all these attacks on other sheriffs.
[01:35:39.665 --> 01:35:41.926]  Mike Clark up in Milwaukee.
[01:35:41.926 --> 01:35:46.887]  I mean, it is just incredible these foreign influences, these multinationals, what they're doing.
[01:35:46.887 --> 01:36:00.650]  And just recapping how this ties together with your whistleblower on Arpaio being surveilled, all the records, it all matches up on what's happening with Trump and the fact, yes, the NSA was spying on him.
[01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:01.831]  Show bombshell.
[01:36:01.831 --> 01:36:03.491]  What else should we impart to the viewers and listeners?
[01:36:04.588 --> 01:36:25.862]  Well, on Sheriff Arpaio's account, if the timeline, and I'm going by memory, so I'm not going to give you dates, but my understanding is this alleged wiretapping, and you have to understand, I have to say alleged because we can't verify it, but the alleged wiretapping... Just like you see a duck swimming around a pond, but you haven't gotten it for DNA testing, you can't say that's a duck.
[01:36:25.862 --> 01:36:33.047]  It looks like a mallard, it has a green head, it's got orange feet, it's eating moss off the bottom, it's swimming around, but we think it's a duck.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:34.380]  Correct.
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:40.185]  And this is when they were pursuing Sheriff Arpaio under a criminal charge.
[01:36:40.185 --> 01:36:44.008]  That criminal case was dropped.
[01:36:44.008 --> 01:36:50.173]  And at the same time, the individuals that were propelling that case moved over to a private law firm.
[01:36:51.164 --> 01:36:55.926]  And then out of the clear blue, a civil proceeding ensued.
[01:36:55.926 --> 01:37:05.411]  Now, my understanding is that during that criminal case, Sheriff Arpaio's attorneys requested from the DOJ their discovery.
[01:37:05.411 --> 01:37:10.253]  And they were told point blank, you are the discovery, you're not getting anything.
[01:37:10.253 --> 01:37:12.074]  But then they dropped the case.
[01:37:12.074 --> 01:37:14.496]  And you have to ask yourself why?
[01:37:14.496 --> 01:37:16.857]  Was it possibly because they were up on the phones?
[01:37:17.904 --> 01:37:19.665]  And they couldn't disclose they were up on the phones?
[01:37:19.665 --> 01:37:21.767]  I mean, nobody knows.
[01:37:21.767 --> 01:37:33.434]  And the civil thing is really nothing more than a doorway under the old administration to gain entrance into sheriff's offices, law enforcement offices, and federally control them.
[01:37:33.434 --> 01:37:34.675]  That was the goal.
[01:37:34.675 --> 01:37:38.418]  And now you have Jeff Sessions who's coming out saying, we're not going to do that anymore.
[01:37:38.418 --> 01:37:41.100]  You have Donald Trump trying to reinstitute
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:51.509]  The same activities conducted by regular law enforcement, given authority by the federal government to conduct, that were taken away by the Obama administration.
[01:37:51.509 --> 01:37:57.896]  Let's be clear, Mike Zullo, Cold Case Posse, head detective that was active until this year, this is so bombshell.
[01:37:58.476 --> 01:38:06.743]  It's admitted that the Feds, some good, some bad, are using spying on local police so criminal networks and the Feds can run their operations.
[01:38:06.743 --> 01:38:09.065]  They can also corrupt police, take control.
[01:38:09.065 --> 01:38:10.586]  It destroys the separation of powers.
[01:38:10.586 --> 01:38:14.249]  Trump is announcing, his Attorney General is announcing, we're ending that.
[01:38:14.249 --> 01:38:17.451]  In fact, we're going to share lawfully obtained information to go after criminals.
[01:38:17.451 --> 01:38:18.552]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:38:18.552 --> 01:38:26.719]  It's why the entire surveillance federal grid is now lining up against Trump because he's taking their ill-gotten, unconstitutional power away.
[01:38:27.219 --> 01:38:32.307]  Like he said, we're going to transfer the power back to the people and back to the states in that inaugural address.
[01:38:32.307 --> 01:38:36.794]  He's doing it, so they're running around like a bunch of Linda Blairs out of control.
[01:38:37.932 --> 01:38:40.253]  Well, and Alex, this goes to morality.
[01:38:40.253 --> 01:38:49.277]  The biggest problem here is, look, this technology is wonderful and could have very great assets to law enforcement if it is used in a moral and just fashion.
[01:38:49.277 --> 01:38:50.377]  And it's not.
[01:38:50.377 --> 01:38:58.440]  And the unsuspecting public just want to believe that their law enforcement agencies, especially the federal agencies, are of that moral standard.
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.281]  Well, that's not happening anymore.
[01:39:00.281 --> 01:39:04.903]  That's what makes this so, so dangerous for the average citizen.
[01:39:05.083 --> 01:39:10.805]  Imagine giving Obama and all these corrupt haters the power of almost God for omnipresent surveillance.
[01:39:10.805 --> 01:39:11.606]  They've had it.
[01:39:11.606 --> 01:39:15.047]  Now they want to say Trump's a liar when he talks about it?
[01:39:15.047 --> 01:39:22.490]  Well, parallel construction would afford them an opportunity to literally gin up a charge against you.
[01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:24.511]  And I want your listeners to understand something else.
[01:39:24.511 --> 01:39:27.272]  I was reading this not too long ago.
[01:39:27.272 --> 01:39:29.713]  My understanding now is there is computer software
[01:39:30.694 --> 01:39:40.376]  That takes voice imprints of your voice, and you could literally have an undetected, altered conversation take place that you weren't even party to.
[01:39:40.376 --> 01:39:41.096]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:39:41.096 --> 01:39:45.097]  They've had software for a decade that could do perfect video and audio.
[01:39:45.097 --> 01:39:49.378]  Now it's publicly available to the public and can break voice prints now.
[01:39:49.378 --> 01:39:52.979]  So that's why they're having to start getting rid of voice prompts, because it can break those.
[01:39:52.979 --> 01:39:53.799]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:39:54.459 --> 01:39:54.920]  Exactly.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:40:07.887]  Think of this power, and it's in the new Vault 7 leaks, what is it, 7,000 pages, they admit that's CIA real documents, that they were planting stuff on the Russians to blame them doing hacks with their software.
[01:40:07.887 --> 01:40:09.208]  Well, they're doing it to citizens as well.
[01:40:10.185 --> 01:40:15.008]  Yeah, so I mean it is very alarming, very concerning, and nobody is safe.
[01:40:15.008 --> 01:40:18.371]  Look, I personally, I don't really care.
[01:40:18.371 --> 01:40:18.871]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:18.871 --> 01:40:20.472]  You knocked yourself out.
[01:40:20.472 --> 01:40:22.313]  But that's not the point.
[01:40:22.313 --> 01:40:24.154]  The point is, is what can be done with this?
[01:40:24.154 --> 01:40:26.096]  What can be done to destroy you?
[01:40:26.096 --> 01:40:27.236]  What can be done to blackmail?
[01:40:27.236 --> 01:40:28.798]  Well, this happened to me two weeks ago.
[01:40:28.798 --> 01:40:32.840]  Stephen Colbert played a clip, and you can watch it in the clip.
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:35.422]  They just edited one word out and blipped it on the internet.
[01:40:35.422 --> 01:40:38.024]  I said, I, I don't hate gays.
[01:40:39.693 --> 01:40:42.634]  And it says, I hate gays.
[01:40:42.634 --> 01:40:44.015]  I mean, that's, they're already doing it.
[01:40:44.015 --> 01:40:45.275]  That's what I mean.
[01:40:45.275 --> 01:40:52.918]  It's like, what do you call the criminal lawless arrogance when it finally builds like a serial killer will kill their first five, six, seven people and be real careful.
[01:40:52.918 --> 01:40:55.239]  Then they start getting reckless and they really want to get reckless.
[01:40:55.239 --> 01:40:57.220]  Then they start sending letters to the cops.
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:41:00.301]  It's like they're thumbing their noses at us in the criminology.
[01:41:00.301 --> 01:41:01.401]  I mean, you're an expert on that.
[01:41:01.401 --> 01:41:02.522]  What do you say about that?
[01:41:02.522 --> 01:41:05.463]  It's because, it's because they believe they are above it all.
[01:41:06.542 --> 01:41:13.564]  And now they take our statutes and they hide behind our statutes to protect the program, protect the information.
[01:41:13.564 --> 01:41:15.184]  There's no oversight.
[01:41:15.184 --> 01:41:17.004]  That's the issue.
[01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:22.605]  There are special programs, I've come to learn, special access programs that are even out of the purview of Congress.
[01:41:22.605 --> 01:41:26.866]  Well, who is issuing the oversight?
[01:41:26.866 --> 01:41:30.767]  Who's running these programs and then how do you know what they're doing with these programs?
[01:41:30.767 --> 01:41:32.528]  It's Pandora's box.
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:38.101]  Orwellian isn't even the word anymore.
[01:41:38.101 --> 01:41:40.241]  I don't even know what you call this.
[01:41:40.241 --> 01:41:47.563]  But in the wrong hands, it is a weapon that's worse than a nuclear warhead, because in a nuclear warhead, you're dead.
[01:41:47.563 --> 01:41:50.823]  You're gonna have to live with whatever these people do to you.
[01:41:50.823 --> 01:42:02.726]  So this is a problem, it's huge, and it's something that our, quote, government, our elected officials, really need to rein in and control to some extent.
[01:42:04.130 --> 01:42:04.510]  I don't know.
[01:42:26.172 --> 01:42:30.435]  I think we're starting to turn the corner, so I'm going to give people a pep talk.
[01:42:30.435 --> 01:42:34.418]  And by the way, I won't do a pep talk if there isn't reasons to have a pep talk.
[01:42:34.418 --> 01:42:38.221]  I see a lot of positive things happening, and we're pulling teeth here.
[01:42:38.221 --> 01:42:45.266]  We're digging out a bunch of entitled, out-of-control social engineers, a bunch of leftists who run this, and they're just out to play God.
[01:42:45.266 --> 01:42:48.088]  No wonder they're so arrogant, but they're not so arrogant now.
[01:42:48.088 --> 01:42:49.629]  They're starting to get the fear of God in them, Mike.
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:52.881]  Well, Alex, thank you for everything that you do.
[01:42:52.881 --> 01:42:58.302]  You, Drudge, WND, others out there, because we don't have a voice.
[01:42:58.302 --> 01:43:02.103]  The blackout that you talked about, it is exactly what they are doing.
[01:43:02.103 --> 01:43:04.604]  If they don't report it, it never happens.
[01:43:04.604 --> 01:43:05.384]  So, thank you.
[01:43:05.384 --> 01:43:05.724]  Same.
[01:43:05.724 --> 01:43:06.224]  Thank you.
[01:43:06.224 --> 01:43:07.024]  Please run this together.
[01:43:07.024 --> 01:43:07.864]  We're all got families.
[01:43:07.864 --> 01:43:08.365]  Run this together.
[01:43:08.365 --> 01:43:08.805]  God bless you.
[01:43:08.805 --> 01:43:09.485]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:43:09.485 --> 01:43:10.045]  You too, brother.
[01:43:10.545 --> 01:43:12.847]  Doc, of course, I know you've got to get and write some more articles.
[01:43:12.847 --> 01:43:13.367]  Great job.
[01:43:13.367 --> 01:43:19.992]  I know you're getting amazing info from the White House, too, on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Obama's deal, and now it's $260-something million, we've learned.
[01:43:19.992 --> 01:43:27.497]  I mean, and your articles are all so powerful, and either from high-level leaks or the White House, you're pointing out what needs to be looked at.
[01:43:27.497 --> 01:43:28.718]  Notice, everything you write
[01:43:29.318 --> 01:43:31.459]  For us, everything else we write gets picked up in the news.
[01:43:31.459 --> 01:43:36.123]  Everything you write, you get a total blacklist, which shows you are really on target, my friend.
[01:43:36.123 --> 01:43:40.045]  So I want to thank you and thank Drudge and everybody else because we are in this together.
[01:43:40.045 --> 01:43:41.266]  But thank God for Drudge.
[01:43:41.266 --> 01:43:44.088]  I don't know how they're going to ignore... Let's put DrudgeReport.com up.
[01:43:44.088 --> 01:43:45.589]  I think it's still the middle column.
[01:43:45.589 --> 01:43:47.730]  It's been up since 4 o'clock yesterday or 5 o'clock.
[01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:53.234]  How in the hell could they ignore the top link on Drudge for almost a day?
[01:43:53.234 --> 01:43:55.416]  I mean, they cover everything he links to.
[01:43:55.416 --> 01:43:57.177]  They must be crapping their britches right now.
[01:43:58.456 --> 01:44:11.965]  Well I think Alex, the key point is, another point that Mike Sulu said, and that is, Mike has been out with this information, he's been begging for it to be proven wrong.
[01:44:11.965 --> 01:44:14.947]  Bringing it to the feds, they ignore it, so finally it's on drudge.
[01:44:15.894 --> 01:44:22.902]  And what we've got to do, and what we're doing, and millions of Americans are paying attention because they're not listening anymore to the mainstream media.
[01:44:22.902 --> 01:44:33.693]  Not listening to, you know, Comey, who looks about as phony as you can get, saying, you know, there's no evidence that Obama wiretapped, you know, ordered the wiretap.
[01:44:33.693 --> 01:44:35.395]  It's all very carefully worded.
[01:44:36.087 --> 01:44:38.749]  And in fact, they're just presenting a Watergate defense.
[01:44:38.749 --> 01:44:43.571]  They know, and this is our pile of information presented in federal court.
[01:44:43.571 --> 01:44:45.552]  I think it's 100% authentic.
[01:44:45.552 --> 01:44:47.553]  It's never been repudiated by the federal government.
[01:44:47.553 --> 01:44:53.337]  And what it shows is that, you know, the federal government decided... And we knew Project Dragnet was admitted and going on.
[01:44:53.337 --> 01:44:53.917]  That's in the news.
[01:44:53.917 --> 01:44:55.478]  This is Dragnet database.
[01:44:55.478 --> 01:44:57.879]  It's 100% authentic.
[01:44:57.879 --> 01:44:59.220]  And I think still continuing.
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:02.422]  I don't think they ever quit.
[01:45:02.422 --> 01:45:04.443]  And 600 million pages of it.
[01:45:06.794 --> 01:45:09.797]  I can't show this is people's home addresses and bank card numbers.
[01:45:09.797 --> 01:45:11.739]  We're not releasing the database.
[01:45:11.739 --> 01:45:19.185]  What we're going to say is we'll be happy to release the database to the Department of Justice or to the White House or to Congress, to official channels.
[01:45:19.185 --> 01:45:22.188]  Yeah, National Press Club with the Attorney General there.
[01:45:22.188 --> 01:45:23.028]  Hand them the hard drives.
[01:45:23.028 --> 01:45:24.329]  Let's just get out in the open.
[01:45:24.329 --> 01:45:26.051]  They're saying the surveillance state isn't happening.
[01:45:27.472 --> 01:45:32.658]  Aren't they crazy, Doc, to admit they're surveilling the President and say they're not and say he's crazy?
[01:45:32.658 --> 01:45:33.319]  Don't they know?
[01:45:33.319 --> 01:45:37.484]  Or are they hoping he's going to bring out classified info when he's already accused them of that?
[01:45:37.484 --> 01:45:41.649]  They wanted to discredit Trump before he has the opportunity to reveal all this.
[01:45:41.649 --> 01:45:47.056]  What you've got is the Department of Justice under Holder and Lynch saying they could prosecute a sheriff.
[01:45:47.651 --> 01:45:48.851]  They could rig the trial.
[01:45:48.851 --> 01:45:50.152]  They could wiretap.
[01:45:50.152 --> 01:45:51.613]  They could judge tamper.
[01:45:51.613 --> 01:45:52.933]  Get away with it.
[01:45:52.933 --> 01:45:56.074]  And one way or the other, find a way to put him in jail.
[01:45:56.074 --> 01:46:00.656]  Now, if that's the standard of justice in the United States of America, we're all in danger.
[01:46:00.656 --> 01:46:10.880]  Because that's targeting, using all these effective tools of surveillance, lying about it, illegally, unconstitutionally using them.
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:14.021]  And then, if the President dares put it out or mention it,
[01:46:16.722 --> 01:46:19.743]  Sure.
[01:46:19.743 --> 01:46:21.684]  Let's back off of this for a minute.
[01:46:21.684 --> 01:46:24.065]  Our government has been sold out to Communist Chinese.
[01:46:24.065 --> 01:46:25.265]  I mean, I don't just say that.
[01:46:25.265 --> 01:46:27.286]  I told people six years ago they were buying up Hollywood.
[01:46:27.286 --> 01:46:28.787]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:46:28.787 --> 01:46:32.008]  I mean, all the intelligence ops, I know high-level people, you name it.
[01:46:32.008 --> 01:46:33.068]  China, China, China.
[01:46:33.068 --> 01:46:33.848]  It's the threat.
[01:46:33.848 --> 01:46:34.449]  Trump knows that.
[01:46:34.449 --> 01:46:37.590]  Nothing against the Chinese people, the horrible Communist Chinese that rule them.
[01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:38.711]  Not Russia.
[01:46:38.711 --> 01:46:40.512]  Russia's not the issue.
[01:46:40.512 --> 01:46:43.294]  Radical Islam and China are the issues.
[01:46:43.294 --> 01:46:47.076]  China, quite frankly, works with radical Islam as a total threat.
[01:46:47.076 --> 01:46:50.398]  They're threatening to nuke the United States and their own peoples daily.
[01:46:50.398 --> 01:46:52.259]  North Korea has never been more belligerent.
[01:46:52.259 --> 01:46:57.543]  It's threatening to load missiles with atomic bombs to hit Seoul, South Korea, or Tokyo, Japan.
[01:46:58.283 --> 01:47:13.647]  Tillerson has said, they load those missiles, we've got to hit them, we've got cruise missiles five minutes off the coast, supersonic, you know, Mach 7 ready to knock, Mach 7 that's classified above that word is they got like Mach 12, and so they can take them out in a matter of 60 seconds probably.
[01:47:13.647 --> 01:47:14.988]  They load those missiles.
[01:47:14.988 --> 01:47:23.930]  The world's never been in a more crazy position before Trump got in, but the elite seems to be accelerating it to stop nationalism like some world war will save them.
[01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:25.531]  What the hell's going on here?
[01:47:26.383 --> 01:47:29.404]  Well it's, it's the, the left is losing.
[01:47:29.404 --> 01:47:30.765]  Globalists are losing.
[01:47:30.765 --> 01:47:33.466]  And they're desperate to destroy Trump.
[01:47:33.466 --> 01:47:36.907]  Which they're trying to do with this Russian nonsense.
[01:47:36.907 --> 01:47:39.648]  They're trying to do with that he wasn't wiretapped.
[01:47:39.648 --> 01:47:41.409]  What we're doing is we're showing the evidence.
[01:47:41.409 --> 01:47:42.829]  Yeah, Trump was under surveillance in 2004.
[01:47:42.829 --> 01:47:46.170]  Sure, so what do we do to rally around him and stop them now?
[01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:48.591]  I mean, Pelosi doesn't even know who's president.
[01:47:48.591 --> 01:47:50.992]  Maxine Waters thinks Russia invaded Korea.
[01:47:50.992 --> 01:47:52.993]  We can't let these lunatics destroy us!
[01:47:53.433 --> 01:48:00.239]  We have to demand, and I want to start with demanding, that Sheriff Arpaio get a new trial.
[01:48:00.239 --> 01:48:03.722]  The Department of Justice gets involved.
[01:48:03.722 --> 01:48:05.704]  We've got to have Congress involved.
[01:48:05.704 --> 01:48:13.391]  Sheriff Arpaio is willing to go to Washington to meet with Congress, to meet with Sessions, to meet with the President, to meet with anyone.
[01:48:13.391 --> 01:48:18.736]  There should be a press conference of, this poor guy got surveilled, and then drag all these prosecutors and people in.
[01:48:19.696 --> 01:48:27.399]  Right, and show that this is criminal activity behind Holder, Loretta Lynch, Tom Perez.
[01:48:27.399 --> 01:48:30.360]  Now he's just going off and being head of the DNC.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.781]  I've never talked about this because it just gets too crazy.
[01:48:34.901 --> 01:48:48.289]  There have been federal court cases and stuff where people are being surveilled, so they're being surveilled while they're talking to me, but then it's in the file that I'm under surveillance as well, and I get sent this stuff from lawyers in the cases, and I'm just too busy to even mess with it, but it's real stuff.
[01:48:48.289 --> 01:48:51.010]  I mean, I've already seen all this NSA surveillance on me for years.
[01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:52.191]  But you're in the file.
[01:48:52.191 --> 01:48:54.752]  We showed you your records.
[01:48:54.752 --> 01:48:56.933]  Of course I'm being watched and listened to, exactly.
[01:48:58.743 --> 01:49:08.610]  And, you know, and this is the point, is that they lie, the NSA, the CIA lie, because they know, you know, you're going to believe them.
[01:49:08.610 --> 01:49:11.152]  The average person's going to believe Comey.
[01:49:11.152 --> 01:49:13.074]  They're going to believe, you know, Clapper.
[01:49:13.074 --> 01:49:15.556]  They're going to believe, because they wouldn't think these people would lie.
[01:49:15.556 --> 01:49:20.859]  These people are the best liars, and they parse everything they say, so it's, you know, precise.
[01:49:20.859 --> 01:49:21.840]  It's all legalese.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:22.661]  It's all legal games.
[01:49:24.142 --> 01:49:30.104]  Sure, sure.
[01:49:30.104 --> 01:49:30.985]  I've got a job here.
[01:49:30.985 --> 01:49:32.145]  I want you to get back to work.
[01:49:32.145 --> 01:49:32.485]  Great job.
[01:49:32.485 --> 01:49:33.726]  Of course, he's setting up our D.C.
[01:49:33.726 --> 01:49:36.347]  Bureau there, formerly WorldNet Daily.
[01:49:36.347 --> 01:49:38.448]  But let me just ask you this, gut level,
[01:49:40.126 --> 01:49:41.327]  I think they're failing.
[01:49:41.327 --> 01:49:43.648]  I think they're going to get even more panicked.
[01:49:43.648 --> 01:49:45.589]  They're really doing some desperate stuff.
[01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:48.811]  They caught a guy saying he was testing to get a bomb into the White House.
[01:49:48.811 --> 01:49:50.752]  There's a lot of crazy stuff going on.
[01:49:50.752 --> 01:49:58.196]  I just want listeners to understand, words can't describe how dangerous and over-the-top everything is right now.
[01:49:58.196 --> 01:50:02.259]  Dr. Corsi, how would you call the timing we're here in historically right now?
[01:50:03.119 --> 01:50:05.500]  I think this is, you know, a critical test.
[01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:14.584]  It's a war, and we're close to winning, which means that, you know, the left, the globalists, are going to pull out all stops running for the finish line.
[01:50:14.584 --> 01:50:17.385]  And they're going to discredit everybody, anybody who tries to tell the truth.
[01:50:17.385 --> 01:50:18.445]  A lot of Hail Marys.
[01:50:18.445 --> 01:50:18.906]  Vicious.
[01:50:18.906 --> 01:50:20.306]  It's going to be vicious.
[01:50:20.306 --> 01:50:21.947]  And it's going to be vicious in the courts.
[01:50:21.947 --> 01:50:23.507]  It's going to be vicious.
[01:50:23.507 --> 01:50:30.970]  But I think the American people, as were proven in this last election, continue to... They're awake.
[01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:32.331]  And are more awake every day.
[01:50:32.875 --> 01:50:37.697]  Because, you know, they see, the average person knows when they're being lied to.
[01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:46.399]  And this, you know, government, and Obama's government, it's got to root just about everybody out of the current government to get rid of them.
[01:50:46.399 --> 01:50:50.381]  And then half of them will try to get hired back again, which is also the problem.
[01:50:50.381 --> 01:50:55.342]  That's a bunch of entitled, spoiled, rotten criminals who have to understand we're never giving up and they're going down.
[01:50:55.342 --> 01:50:56.082]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[01:50:56.082 --> 01:50:57.863]  All right, the nuclear war news straight ahead.
[01:50:59.721 --> 01:51:03.423]  Are you putting your money into an IRA, pension or 401k?
[01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:08.545]  Then I hope you're prepared to lose 30, 40, 50% or more of your retirement savings.
[01:51:08.545 --> 01:51:11.407]  Because it's not a question of if the market crashes again.
[01:51:11.407 --> 01:51:12.747]  It's a question of when.
[01:51:12.747 --> 01:51:14.328]  It's going to happen.
[01:51:14.328 --> 01:51:19.611]  Did you know there is a way you can protect and grow your wealth safely and predictably every single year?
[01:51:19.611 --> 01:51:23.993]  The people using this approach didn't lose a penny when the market crashed in 2000 or 2008.
[01:51:23.993 --> 01:51:26.634]  And they won't lose a penny in the next crash.
[01:51:26.954 --> 01:51:33.819]  In fact, their money will continue to grow safely year in and year out, even when stocks, real estate, and other investments tumble.
[01:51:33.819 --> 01:51:37.161]  A free report detailing this savings program is now available.

[01:51:47.769 --> 01:51:50.210]  It far outperforms any IRA or 401k.

[01:52:59.508 --> 01:53:00.868]  Hi there, Dick Allgaier here.
[01:53:00.868 --> 01:53:05.690]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:09.071]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[01:53:09.071 --> 01:53:11.752]  I am very skeptical of health supplements.
[01:53:11.752 --> 01:53:15.833]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One.
[01:53:15.833 --> 01:53:20.215]  So I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[01:53:20.555 --> 01:53:23.577]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters.
[01:53:23.577 --> 01:53:29.342]  Those little energy drinks that have caffeine and guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[01:53:29.342 --> 01:53:30.463]  This is not that.
[01:53:30.463 --> 01:53:33.725]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[01:53:33.725 --> 01:53:34.966]  My mood is better.
[01:53:34.966 --> 01:53:36.347]  My joints feel better.
[01:53:36.347 --> 01:53:40.911]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[01:53:40.911 --> 01:53:44.514]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more.
[01:53:44.514 --> 01:53:46.515]  So I recommend Synergy One.
[01:53:46.515 --> 01:53:47.616]  It's really good stuff.
[01:53:47.616 --> 01:53:49.398]  I'm having great results with it.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.906]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:53:52.906 --> 01:53:54.849]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:54:21.497 --> 01:54:28.801]  It is so archetypal.
[01:54:28.801 --> 01:54:35.305]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:54:35.305 --> 01:54:39.588]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:54:39.588 --> 01:54:48.653]  Globalist David Rockefeller dead at 101.
[01:54:48.653 --> 01:54:50.334]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[01:54:51.488 --> 01:54:53.932]  Didn't it?
[01:54:53.932 --> 01:55:02.543]  Apropos, fitting that Trump's cutting the funding for 50% of the UN, kicking the globalists out, not letting them sit here and suck off the American people.
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.481]  Not as he starts to kill the U.N.
[01:55:05.481 --> 01:55:07.463]  that David Rockefeller literally created.
[01:55:07.463 --> 01:55:09.044]  Oh yeah, his family.
[01:55:09.044 --> 01:55:11.006]  He was the head guy that he dies.
[01:55:11.006 --> 01:55:13.248]  It is certainly an omen, is it not?
[01:55:13.248 --> 01:55:16.591]  A fitting omen of their misfortune and their failure.
[01:55:16.591 --> 01:55:22.055]  Like Hillary denying she was falling down the next day falls down on TV there on 9-11.
[01:55:22.055 --> 01:55:26.719]  Globalists freak out over Trump's proposed U.N.
[01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:27.220]  cuts.
[01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:27.900]  Infowars.com.
[01:55:29.952 --> 01:55:36.757]  I was watching during the break the live hearings and they had these different Democratic Congress people going, is Russia our enemy?
[01:55:36.757 --> 01:55:38.398]  Yes, they are.
[01:55:38.398 --> 01:55:45.263]  And I find it interesting that Roger Stone and Manafort were hired for their Russian connections and fired for them.
[01:55:45.263 --> 01:55:53.369]  Manafort and them worked for the Republicans since Nixon and the ones that introduced Trump to Nixon and then Reagan.
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:59.463]  But see, they've now made them Russians in the news.
[01:55:59.463 --> 01:56:01.365]  Because Manafort did some stuff for Ukraine.
[01:56:01.365 --> 01:56:04.848]  Did it in Latin American countries too.
[01:56:04.848 --> 01:56:09.253]  Was trying to, by the way, bring Ukraine into the EU, by the way.
[01:56:09.253 --> 01:56:17.100]  Just like Trump just... So we can use our coal and gas prices on natural gas plummeted, which actually hurts Russia.
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:19.703]  And he's not trying to hurt Russia, just sorry America first.
[01:56:21.374 --> 01:56:32.559]  But you look at these traitors, these pieces of crap in Congress, the cowardly Republicans, the sell-out Democrats, all they're playing along, all the guys in their military outfits, all these yes-men generals.
[01:56:32.559 --> 01:56:46.325]  And they're up there when they work for the foreign globalist power that's hijacked this country, acting like Trump's the enemy and acting like Trump's the problem, when they're the ones that gave North Korea the weapons, when they're the ones that sold us out to Islam, when they're the ones that sold us out to Communist China and our jobs.
[01:56:46.325 --> 01:56:49.967]  And then here comes a guy trying to be decent, and they run around saying he's a foreign agent.
[01:56:50.882 --> 01:56:55.285]  When Hillary was on the Communist Chinese payroll publicly, it's incredible.
[01:56:55.285 --> 01:57:02.109]  This world being so unstable, if they bring down Trump, which they're trying to do, they're trying to demonize him before they kill him, you need high-quality, storable foods.
[01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:03.890]  I know I've increased the amounts I've got.
[01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:05.731]  People keep thinking, oh, go back to sleep, Trump's in.
[01:57:05.731 --> 01:57:07.732]  Oh, yeah, I get ready.
[01:57:07.732 --> 01:57:08.973]  We usually do this once a year.
[01:57:08.973 --> 01:57:10.694]  I'm doing it every few months now.
[01:57:10.694 --> 01:57:16.017]  It's 30 to 40% off all the high-quality, storable foods that are fresh, produced right here in America by My Patriot Supply.
[01:57:17.847 --> 01:57:19.128]  I already have the lowest prices out there.
[01:57:19.128 --> 01:57:20.068]  We have their full spectrum.
[01:57:20.068 --> 01:57:20.988]  It's drop-shipped from them.
[01:57:20.988 --> 01:57:23.389]  We have their full catalog.
[01:57:23.389 --> 01:57:27.691]  But under InfoWars Select, we can discount it, even though it's the exact same food.
[01:57:27.691 --> 01:57:28.892]  Just a different label.
[01:57:28.892 --> 01:57:30.372]  That gets around contracts.
[01:57:30.372 --> 01:57:33.754]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:33.754 --> 01:57:38.476]  SuperVelvet Vitality's amazing concentrated compounds of known herbs and naturally.
[01:57:39.497 --> 01:57:43.920]  Go in there and block all the different things the globalists have been putting out, the estrogen mimickers, all of it.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:47.604]  More libido, stamina, you name it, it works like a charm.
[01:57:47.604 --> 01:57:56.171]  Go read the tens of thousands of reviews on our different products on Power Review third-party sites linked on InfoWars.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:57:59.318 --> 01:58:03.481]  The new Caveman bone broth and turmeric formula that's so amazing is available.
[01:58:03.481 --> 01:58:05.262]  There's nothing else like it out there.
[01:58:05.262 --> 01:58:08.945]  These are all game-changing products, just like our information's game-changing.
[01:58:08.945 --> 01:58:16.810]  But your purchase of the water filtration systems, non-GMO heirloom seeds and more, funds an organization dedicated... There wouldn't be anybody out there except Rudge!
[01:58:17.711 --> 01:58:19.092]  He doesn't have a big staff like we do.
[01:58:19.092 --> 01:58:20.492]  He's putting our stuff out.
[01:58:20.492 --> 01:58:27.996]  Wouldn't be anybody out there that'll put out the hardcore stuff you just saw today about Trump with the documents, surveilled by Obama and the NSA.
[01:58:27.996 --> 01:58:29.317]  Nobody without us.
[01:58:29.317 --> 01:58:30.157]  Without you.
[01:58:30.157 --> 01:58:31.538]  You are the Infowar.
[01:58:31.538 --> 01:58:36.520]  I salute everyone that's ever supported us, and I ask for your prayers and continued support now more than ever.
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:40.642]  InfowarStore.com or 888-253-33139.
[01:58:40.642 --> 01:58:42.363]  We got Mr. Horowitz joining us.
[01:58:42.363 --> 01:58:43.984]  We got Roger Stone with breaking news and more.
[01:58:43.984 --> 01:58:45.104]  Third Hour, stay with us.
[01:58:45.104 --> 01:58:46.685]  GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:52.011]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.011 --> 01:58:57.172]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:58:57.172 --> 01:59:00.454]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:59:00.454 --> 01:59:06.256]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:59:06.256 --> 01:59:11.978]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:59:12.398 --> 01:59:15.359]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:59:15.359 --> 01:59:20.921]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:59:20.921 --> 01:59:27.943]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:59:27.943 --> 01:59:32.505]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:59:32.785 --> 01:59:36.068]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:59:36.068 --> 01:59:38.170]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:43.896]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:59:43.896 --> 01:59:46.318]  Check it out at PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:46.318 --> 01:59:52.364]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:52.364 --> 01:59:55.027]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.908 --> 02:00:15.591]  You know, it doesn't make me feel tough to be politically involved and see what we do having massive effects.
[02:00:15.591 --> 02:00:19.192]  It makes me feel ashamed.
[02:00:19.192 --> 02:00:23.613]  Because I look at all these strong, smart men around me
[02:00:36.502 --> 02:00:40.904]  And they just think watching TV all day and acting tough and drinking cases of beer is what a man does.
[02:00:40.904 --> 02:00:43.885]  I'm not saying drinking beer is a bad thing.
[02:00:43.885 --> 02:00:47.706]  You've got to turn your brain off sometime, don't you?
[02:00:47.706 --> 02:00:54.128]  I know one thing, we've got scum trying to destroy the first good president we've had in a long time.
[02:00:54.128 --> 02:01:02.791]  There's an epic battle going on and Trump's just shoveling prosperity to people, all that stolen prosperity the elites took by a managed economy, a monopoly economy.
[02:01:05.154 --> 02:01:14.903]  I watch a bunch of cowards and trash just want to act cool around other people and join in on the Trump bashing when they don't deserve somebody like that standing up for them.
[02:01:14.903 --> 02:01:21.208]  And that's how the elites get a lot of good men to join them is they say, look, the public doesn't want your help.
[02:01:21.208 --> 02:01:21.909]  They're a bunch of trash.
[02:01:21.909 --> 02:01:22.569]  Go ahead and try to help them.
[02:01:22.569 --> 02:01:23.410]  They're scum.
[02:01:23.410 --> 02:01:24.671]  Feed on them.
[02:01:24.671 --> 02:01:25.172]  Here's the difference.
[02:01:26.161 --> 02:01:29.983]  I know there are a lot of good people that do know the truth who are fighting back, trying to be moral.
[02:01:29.983 --> 02:01:35.886]  And even though they're a minority of every race, color, and creed, they deserve to not be slaves, and I'm going to stand up for them.
[02:01:35.886 --> 02:01:48.852]  And I'm never, just because the average person is like a brain-damaged robot now, left in their cribs, never touched by their parents while they worked, didn't get proper fat in mother's milk, their brains are about a third smaller than they should be.
[02:01:48.852 --> 02:01:54.075]  I see white zombies, black zombies, Hispanic zombies, you name it, just everybody's zomboing.
[02:01:55.492 --> 02:01:58.393]  Zombo and bad.
[02:01:58.393 --> 02:02:09.836]  I saw a TV ad when I was in Stephenville this weekend doing some hog hunting with my son.
[02:02:09.836 --> 02:02:17.238]  We're staying at a hotel and I had the TV on in the morning for a few minutes looking for some news.
[02:02:17.238 --> 02:02:21.739]  And I just saw this ad saying, don't sleep with your baby in the bed with you.
[02:02:21.739 --> 02:02:23.060]  The crib's the way to go or it'll die.
[02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:28.773]  Instant, sudden infant death syndrome is vaccines.
[02:02:28.773 --> 02:02:31.516]  They always die the night after or whatever.
[02:02:31.516 --> 02:02:36.260]  Inflammation on the brain, they stop breathing, poor little things, their brainstems swell up.
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:37.861]  I googled that yesterday, I couldn't find it.
[02:02:37.861 --> 02:02:40.123]  Maybe somebody around here can, but that's so sick.
[02:02:42.133 --> 02:02:44.033]  The Industrial Age said they didn't want parents anymore.
[02:02:44.033 --> 02:02:45.134]  They wanted everything industrialized.
[02:02:45.134 --> 02:02:46.854]  They wanted kids raised with formula.
[02:02:46.854 --> 02:02:48.394]  So mothers should be working in factories.
[02:02:48.394 --> 02:02:57.036]  And of course they designed the formula to cause a small brain on purpose to cause a kind of a servile, Aldous Huxley, Brave New World.
[02:02:57.036 --> 02:02:59.116]  And Huxley wrote non-fiction books about that.
[02:02:59.116 --> 02:03:04.777]  So did his brother at the UN, officially running the programs at UNESCO to do that.
[02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:06.518]  And I'm not judging mothers that give their kids formula.
[02:03:08.988 --> 02:03:11.168]  You know, there's better ones than others.
[02:03:11.168 --> 02:03:19.430]  The old-fashioned thing was goat's milk or, you know, jenny milk, a jackass milk, female jackass donkey milk.
[02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:23.331]  But, that's a fact.
[02:03:23.331 --> 02:03:35.974]  That a child that isn't held in the first six months up against their mother and father, up against skin, doesn't feel the heartbeat, it's electromagnetic, doesn't sleep in between you and the bed, that's all the bed he ever wants to get in is in the bed with you, you know that.
[02:03:37.028 --> 02:03:40.870]  If you don't sleep with your kids, they're not accused probably 10 to 15 points.
[02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:41.951]  There's a bunch of studies.
[02:03:41.951 --> 02:03:42.971]  Some of them show more.
[02:03:42.971 --> 02:03:51.836]  If you leave them in a crib and then you give them formula and you put them in front of TV, that's not a person.
[02:03:51.836 --> 02:03:52.556]  I guess they found it.
[02:03:52.556 --> 02:03:54.957]  Yeah, there was a, there's a sleep PSA.
[02:03:54.957 --> 02:03:55.738]  It's like 10 seconds long.
[02:03:55.738 --> 02:03:59.199]  It's like, it's a mother and father sleeping a little baby between them.
[02:03:59.199 --> 02:04:00.540]  And they just say, don't do this.
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:01.160]  It's not safe.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.141]  Let me see if this is the same one.
[02:04:04.062 --> 02:04:04.802]  No, it's another one.
[02:04:04.802 --> 02:04:07.123]  It shows like a black man and a black woman with their baby.
[02:04:07.123 --> 02:04:08.084]  Oh yeah.
[02:04:08.084 --> 02:04:11.606]  It says your kid will be in a grave if you sleep with your kid.
[02:04:11.606 --> 02:04:15.187]  Good God.
[02:04:15.187 --> 02:04:29.054]  I mean, what mammal, whether it's hedgehogs or dogs, wolves, tigers, elephants, what mammal when it sleeps does the baby not come up and get right up against mommy to keep warm but also keep safe?
[02:04:33.959 --> 02:04:36.600]  Don't sleep with your kid.
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:41.922]  Hell, they'll probably have Colbert take that out of context, say I'm raping kids or something.
[02:04:41.922 --> 02:04:43.222]  You're just a bunch of trash.
[02:04:43.222 --> 02:04:43.822]  And you know what?
[02:04:43.822 --> 02:04:44.903]  You got it on your heads.
[02:04:44.903 --> 02:04:46.203]  Everything you did to the people.
[02:04:46.203 --> 02:04:48.644]  Like Christ said, what you did to the least of me, you done to me.
[02:04:48.644 --> 02:04:51.665]  Better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw it in the ocean.
[02:04:51.665 --> 02:04:56.007]  All of us should thank God that we're not these traitors and these scum.
[02:04:56.007 --> 02:04:56.507]  We'll be back.
[02:04:56.507 --> 02:04:56.927]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.146 --> 02:05:03.248]  Robo Bezos!
[02:05:03.248 --> 02:05:09.051]  The CIA-affiliated owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, donned a robo suit straight out of Avatar.
[02:05:09.051 --> 02:05:15.375]  Bezos hopped in the pilot seat of the 13-foot mobile hunk of metal with arms and legs, mimicking those of a human's.
[02:05:15.375 --> 02:05:20.038]  He smiled for the cameras and said with a smile, Bow down before your new king and master!
[02:05:20.498 --> 02:05:25.783]  The robot he was operating is the Method 2, built by the South Korean company Hankook Marae.
[02:05:25.783 --> 02:05:30.688]  It operates with two joysticks to control the arms, and leg pedals to control the legs.
[02:05:30.688 --> 02:05:38.456]  The robot does still need support in order to stand, essentially still in training wheels, but the giant metal puppet is certainly turning heads in the tech industry.
[02:05:38.456 --> 02:05:40.158]  While it is all fun and games for now,
[02:05:40.438 --> 02:05:48.127]  Keep in mind, robot police are now a reality, with more law enforcement, including in the U.S., looking to robot police in the future.
[02:05:48.127 --> 02:05:52.712]  The military has also said it wants to move away from humans and more towards robots.
[02:05:52.712 --> 02:05:54.934]  Is the robo-arms race on?
[02:05:54.934 --> 02:05:57.497]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[02:05:59.929 --> 02:06:01.770]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:06:01.770 --> 02:06:08.374]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:08.374 --> 02:06:11.515]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:11.515 --> 02:06:21.301]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[02:06:21.301 --> 02:06:22.141]  Caveman.
[02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:27.224]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:27.224 --> 02:06:29.325]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:29.625 --> 02:06:32.767]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:32.767 --> 02:06:37.930]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:37.930 --> 02:06:46.074]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:46.074 --> 02:06:53.858]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:53.858 --> 02:06:58.661]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forestlife.com today.

[02:08:27.331 --> 02:08:31.855]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.855 --> 02:08:34.137]  Yeah, it's not a mea culpa, it's just a fact.
[02:08:34.137 --> 02:08:43.504]  When I read, was it Unholy Alliance, like 12, 13 years ago, or longer, by David Horowitz, I thought, this is the biggest bunch of fear-mongering I've ever heard.
[02:08:43.504 --> 02:08:50.389]  The left are gonna, like, bring in people that kill homosexuals, and that chop women's genitals off.
[02:08:50.389 --> 02:08:50.890]  Now to the left,
[02:08:51.653 --> 02:08:59.099]  Well, he has wars with them, but I just thought, I mean, I know they're cuckold and want to dominate people, but I just never could believe it.
[02:08:59.099 --> 02:09:02.102]  And then now everything Horowitz wrote about is like the blueprint for everything that happened.
[02:09:02.102 --> 02:09:11.329]  And now I'm just, in fact, I went and re-read it last week, actually dug it out of the garage, and I was just like, it was sickening.
[02:09:11.329 --> 02:09:14.552]  I feel like chills up my spine because his parents were communists.
[02:09:16.187 --> 02:09:17.468]  God love them.
[02:09:17.468 --> 02:09:20.590]  My parents were like, America first, you know, libertarian right wingers.
[02:09:20.590 --> 02:09:31.737]  I just, I just cannot get my mind wrapped around wanting to blow up a free open society and running around screaming and yelling and bitching at everybody about how they hate women and they want to bring Muslims in.
[02:09:31.737 --> 02:09:33.718]  I know there's some Muslims that are great people.
[02:09:33.718 --> 02:09:34.579]  They're heretics!
[02:09:35.419 --> 02:09:43.324]  They want to leave, because in Islam they say, now that I've studied it, it's been a crash course the last five years, House of War is where Islam is not.
[02:09:43.324 --> 02:09:47.387]  But Horowitz is the expert on this, and I had him coming on about that in his new book, The Big Agenda.
[02:09:47.387 --> 02:09:56.053]  I mean, Trump, best numbers on small business since 1984, peak of the Reagan recovery, three trillion in the stock market, just everything he's doing is for the little guy.
[02:09:56.053 --> 02:09:59.476]  But it's also making the rich guys a ton of money, and they want to destroy him.
[02:10:00.416 --> 02:10:04.984]  And they are just, they say, I'm a Russian dupe, Roger Stone's a Russian agent.
[02:10:04.984 --> 02:10:07.468]  I mean, so he wants to talk about the hearings.
[02:10:07.468 --> 02:10:11.034]  I'm glad he does, because I was going to say, hey, we're going to talk about this, but you come on about that.
[02:10:11.034 --> 02:10:12.737]  I just want to know, because he's an expert on the left.
[02:10:12.737 --> 02:10:13.799]  He really knows how they operate.
[02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:16.041]  I guess he was one of them.
[02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:16.922]  I don't mean that insultingly.
[02:10:16.922 --> 02:10:18.363]  He admits he was.
[02:10:18.363 --> 02:10:19.745]  I just now realize how bad they are.
[02:10:19.745 --> 02:10:22.648]  I just can't believe that even exists.
[02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:24.330]  It's like Nazis or something.
[02:10:24.330 --> 02:10:25.010]  Or communists.
[02:10:25.010 --> 02:10:26.752]  It's just what the hell is going on here?
[02:10:26.752 --> 02:10:28.134]  But I guess a lot of them are victims.
[02:10:28.134 --> 02:10:29.035]  They get sucked into it.
[02:10:29.035 --> 02:10:30.196]  I don't understand it all.
[02:10:30.196 --> 02:10:31.417]  I got a blind spot.
[02:10:31.417 --> 02:10:31.797]  And so...
[02:10:33.117 --> 02:10:38.060]  I look at North Korean places and Venezuela and I just say, I mean, capitalism ain't perfect, but it's pretty damn good.
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:39.481]  That's why everybody wants to come here.
[02:10:39.481 --> 02:10:45.524]  I'm no rocket scientist, but you know, I know there's a lot more choices here, a lot more freedom here, a lot more opportunity here.
[02:10:45.524 --> 02:10:47.025]  And I've been to some of these third world countries.
[02:10:47.025 --> 02:10:49.567]  So going to Horowitz, I'm going to skip the breaks so we have more time.
[02:10:49.567 --> 02:10:50.628]  He's an American conservative writer.
[02:10:51.528 --> 02:10:55.390]  Founder and current president of the think tank, the Ed Horowitz Freedom Center.
[02:10:55.390 --> 02:11:00.833]  He also writes for FrontPageMagazine.com and a bunch of other big publications.
[02:11:00.833 --> 02:11:03.175]  He's also worked as a columnist for Salon.
[02:11:03.175 --> 02:11:06.857]  The editor, Josh Walsh, described him as a conservative provocateur.
[02:11:06.857 --> 02:11:13.561]  I'm not going to go over all his background, but until 1975, he was an outspoken adherent of the New Left.
[02:11:14.241 --> 02:11:18.384]  So he joins us now to talk about the state of the world.
[02:11:18.384 --> 02:11:23.448]  A lot of people told me, like Roger Stone, when he was here on election night, relax, there'll be prosperity, people will be happy.
[02:11:23.448 --> 02:11:24.369]  I said, they're not going to stop.
[02:11:24.369 --> 02:11:26.971]  I saw the crazed behavior.
[02:11:26.971 --> 02:11:29.153]  I see the left yell at me in public and threaten me.
[02:11:29.153 --> 02:11:31.755]  I've never seen anything like this.
[02:11:31.755 --> 02:11:32.736]  It's total mental illness.
[02:11:32.736 --> 02:11:38.360]  So perhaps David Horowitz, one of the top experts on this disease, can break down what's happening.
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.781]  David, thanks for joining us.
[02:11:39.781 --> 02:11:41.062]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:11:41.062 --> 02:11:42.163]  It is a disease.
[02:11:43.584 --> 02:11:48.487]  Look, the left is a crypto-religious movement, or a religious cult.
[02:11:48.487 --> 02:11:52.330]  And by left, I include the Democratic Party.
[02:11:52.330 --> 02:11:54.411]  Progressives.
[02:11:54.411 --> 02:11:58.113]  They have all these names that hide what they actually are.
[02:11:58.113 --> 02:12:04.297]  But they believe the world is a fallen place, although they wouldn't use such an expression.
[02:12:04.297 --> 02:12:10.181]  It's a place of oppression, hierarchy, domination, and so forth.
[02:12:10.181 --> 02:12:11.642]  And they believe in a redemption.
[02:12:12.759 --> 02:12:19.004]  But the redemption is going to be carried out by them instead of a divinity.
[02:12:19.004 --> 02:12:22.947]  True religions understand that we're the problem.
[02:12:23.806 --> 02:12:28.567]  It's people that are the problem and therefore you really can't fix it.
[02:12:28.567 --> 02:12:33.148]  And that's why, you know, conservatives are prone to a kind of fatalistic view.
[02:12:33.148 --> 02:12:36.109]  Things are probably going to get worse.
[02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:38.710]  And that handicaps them in this battle.
[02:12:38.710 --> 02:12:42.811]  But for the left, there's this promised land.
[02:12:44.111 --> 02:12:47.794]  I'm afraid the Jews are responsible for this idea.
[02:12:47.794 --> 02:12:58.622]  There's this promised land, which used to be called communism or socialism, but now it's called social justice, where all their dreams are going to be fulfilled.
[02:12:58.622 --> 02:13:07.729]  So, if you understand that they're a religious cult, you will also understand that they see themselves as the army of the saints.
[02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:13.073]  And they see the rest of us, those who don't go along with their program,
[02:13:14.477 --> 02:13:17.700]  As the party of the devil.
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:19.241]  In fact that's what they say.
[02:13:19.241 --> 02:13:20.542]  It's just wild.
[02:13:20.542 --> 02:13:24.265]  So Rachel Maddow, college professors, they're all in the priesthood.
[02:13:25.677 --> 02:13:26.698]  That's right.
[02:13:26.698 --> 02:13:32.721]  And they talk like hellfire and damnation preachers all the time.
[02:13:32.721 --> 02:13:36.022]  That's why the Democrats are so effective politically.
[02:13:36.022 --> 02:13:39.064]  Everything they say is a moral indictment.
[02:13:39.064 --> 02:13:44.286]  Republicans talk like accountants.
[02:13:44.286 --> 02:13:51.030]  It doesn't motivate people as powerfully as the left's vision does.
[02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:54.351]  And it doesn't kill our enemies the way the left
[02:13:56.997 --> 02:14:02.640]  Resort to calling you a racist, sexist, homophobe, deplorable.
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:06.482]  The Democratic Party is a party of hate.
[02:14:06.482 --> 02:14:09.363]  It runs on hate all the time.
[02:14:09.363 --> 02:14:13.465]  And that sort of glues up their mind.
[02:14:13.465 --> 02:14:21.309]  So when they see Islam, they see people of color because they're racists.
[02:14:21.309 --> 02:14:24.090]  The term people of color is a racist term.
[02:14:27.579 --> 02:14:30.622]  We don't speak that way in English.
[02:14:30.622 --> 02:14:31.243]  There they are.
[02:14:31.243 --> 02:14:34.426]  So it's called programming, exactly.
[02:14:34.426 --> 02:14:36.047]  So where are they now?
[02:14:36.047 --> 02:14:37.609]  What's happening to them worldwide?
[02:14:37.609 --> 02:14:39.651]  Why are they like tripling their viciousness?
[02:14:41.084 --> 02:14:44.026]  Well, because they see that Trump is a serious threat.
[02:14:44.026 --> 02:14:46.747]  Brexit is a threat.
[02:14:46.747 --> 02:14:54.112]  You know, they like governments which are completely unresponsive to the people because the people are the problem.
[02:14:54.112 --> 02:14:58.495]  That's why they put so many people in the gulag and shoot so many people when they get the power.
[02:14:59.255 --> 02:15:04.136]  Because they have a program to really... Exactly, their religion has reduced the earth's population.
[02:15:04.136 --> 02:15:07.637]  David Rockefeller, Bill Gates, they're the high priest of all this.
[02:15:07.637 --> 02:15:13.919]  And their final secret, I guess, that you learn in the cult is people are the problem, kill everybody.
[02:15:13.919 --> 02:15:16.820]  Well, yeah, that's the endgame.
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:25.002]  But along the way, people are the problem because they don't go along with their socialist ideas.
[02:15:26.784 --> 02:15:27.665]  This is the problem.
[02:15:27.665 --> 02:15:29.306]  They got defeated in the election.
[02:15:29.306 --> 02:15:30.407]  They can't accept that.
[02:15:30.407 --> 02:15:31.888]  So they call it a resistance.
[02:15:31.888 --> 02:15:32.568]  And this is true.
[02:15:32.568 --> 02:15:35.791]  And you predicted 20 plus years ago exactly what would happen in the future.
[02:15:35.791 --> 02:15:37.072]  Now I've read most of your books.
[02:15:37.072 --> 02:15:44.137]  Then tell us, looking forward, Mr. Horowitz, what's going to happen in the future if we don't really take action and what we should do to stop these people?
[02:15:44.137 --> 02:15:46.179]  Because they're clearly bloodthirsty authoritarians.
[02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:52.583]  Well, yeah, I mean, Ian Feinstein said the other day that their strategy is to impeach Trump.
[02:15:52.583 --> 02:15:54.584]  That's what these hearings are about.
[02:15:54.584 --> 02:15:58.507]  And these hearings show how stupid Republicans are.
[02:15:58.507 --> 02:16:07.194]  Why would Devin Nunes call a hearing on the Russian collusion when there's no evidence of it?
[02:16:07.194 --> 02:16:09.796]  He's playing along like a little cup coward.
[02:16:09.796 --> 02:16:11.638]  Well, no, yes, it's because they...
[02:16:12.694 --> 02:16:15.316]  They think they can appease these people.
[02:16:15.316 --> 02:16:22.100]  He thinks that, okay, we'll hold hearings and then they'll see we're reasonable and we actually want to see da-da-da-da.
[02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:24.642]  No, it shows weakness and they attack more.
[02:16:24.642 --> 02:16:25.302]  Exactly.
[02:16:25.302 --> 02:16:27.964]  That's not what the hearings are about.
[02:16:27.964 --> 02:16:32.047]  These Democrats, they don't even ask questions that Comey can answer.
[02:16:32.047 --> 02:16:34.808]  They read indictments.
[02:16:34.808 --> 02:16:36.629]  They just say, is Russia the enemy?
[02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:38.671]  And it's all coordinated.
[02:16:39.218 --> 02:16:40.739]  And then they go, is Trump talking to Russia?
[02:16:40.739 --> 02:16:42.660]  Well, of course the president talks to Russia.
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:45.681]  That's this new thing, like if he ever talks to Russia, it's illegal.
[02:16:45.681 --> 02:16:51.864]  His right mind could think that Trump is colluding with the Russians against America.
[02:16:51.864 --> 02:16:55.626]  The only people who are capable of that are Democrats.
[02:16:55.626 --> 02:16:56.787]  In fact, you're an expert on this.
[02:16:56.787 --> 02:16:58.007]  Your parents were involved in it.
[02:16:58.007 --> 02:17:01.589]  I mean, the whole history, it's always Democrats with the Russians.
[02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:06.031]  My mother was a card-carrying communist and a registered Democrat.
[02:17:06.031 --> 02:17:07.112]  And there are lots of those.
[02:17:08.228 --> 02:17:09.348]  Lots of them.
[02:17:09.348 --> 02:17:13.450]  But you don't have to be a member of the Communist Party to think like a communist.
[02:17:13.450 --> 02:17:20.612]  You just have to believe that there's an earthly redemption called social justice or communism.
[02:17:20.612 --> 02:17:23.053]  It's the same thing.
[02:17:23.053 --> 02:17:31.256]  And that if you get enough power and you demonize your opponents enough and destroy them, you can achieve this wonderful redemption.
[02:17:31.256 --> 02:17:32.596]  Meanwhile, they call us bullies.
[02:17:32.596 --> 02:17:35.497]  So what's their plan to get Trump out?
[02:17:35.497 --> 02:17:37.618]  And if they get him out, what do we expect and how do we stop him?
[02:17:39.002 --> 02:17:40.544]  Well, they're planning that.
[02:17:40.544 --> 02:17:43.849]  First, it's the Torium with this Russia brush.
[02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:49.738]  But look, they've driven... Trump has done so many... I mean, you've discussed some of the amazing things he's already done.
[02:17:49.738 --> 02:17:51.301]  It's only two months.
[02:17:51.301 --> 02:17:53.844]  You know, he's got the stock market... Which, by the way, your book breaks down.
[02:17:53.844 --> 02:17:54.666]  Let's talk about your book.
[02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:56.990]  Big agenda.
[02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:58.511]  Trump's plan to save America.
[02:17:58.511 --> 02:18:02.193]  Yeah, I have all the things that you knew he was going to do.
[02:18:02.193 --> 02:18:13.218]  You know, during the campaign, when he was a little bit more unknown what he would do as a politician, people said, oh, he's not going to fulfill any of his promises.
[02:18:13.218 --> 02:18:16.159]  But here's a guy who puts his name on everything he does.
[02:18:16.159 --> 02:18:19.921]  Puts his name on his buildings, his resorts, his airplanes.
[02:18:19.921 --> 02:18:23.102]  His whole dynasty is about legacy, is about delivering.
[02:18:23.382 --> 02:18:25.306]  His reputation.
[02:18:25.306 --> 02:18:29.736]  There's no way on earth he's not going to build the wall.
[02:18:29.736 --> 02:18:30.818]  That's why he's doing it.
[02:18:30.818 --> 02:18:32.241]  And so they get more and more enraged.
[02:18:33.430 --> 02:18:34.651]  Exactly.
[02:18:34.651 --> 02:18:36.533]  Well, they don't hear and they don't see.
[02:18:36.533 --> 02:18:38.374]  I mean, it's so hypocritical.
[02:18:38.374 --> 02:18:42.198]  Here, Hillary actually violated the espionage laws.
[02:18:42.198 --> 02:18:43.619]  She lied to the FBI.
[02:18:43.619 --> 02:18:44.820]  She lied to the public.
[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:46.882]  She lied to the Congress.
[02:18:46.882 --> 02:18:52.887]  She shared our secrets with all our enemies, not just Russia, but Russia, Iran, China.
[02:18:56.044 --> 02:18:57.185]  It's total projection.
[02:18:57.185 --> 02:18:58.966]  Everything they say about Trump.
[02:18:58.966 --> 02:18:59.747]  Correct.
[02:18:59.747 --> 02:19:02.108]  In fact, it's almost sickening how good he is.
[02:19:02.108 --> 02:19:04.990]  He's like so good compared to them.
[02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:06.451]  It's such upside down world.
[02:19:06.451 --> 02:19:13.516]  Then they project everything they are admittedly onto this guy who's got the whole corrupt elite against him because he's delivering prosperity.
[02:19:14.278 --> 02:19:15.559]  Correct.
[02:19:15.559 --> 02:19:19.322]  Once you understand it's a religious cult, they don't think.
[02:19:19.322 --> 02:19:22.385]  And by the way, Bannon admits, as he reads you, he wants to break their cult.
[02:19:22.385 --> 02:19:26.408]  Those are his writings, obviously inspired by your truth, because you're just seeing objective truth.
[02:19:26.408 --> 02:19:27.489]  We're like following Horowitz here.
[02:19:27.489 --> 02:19:28.390]  It's true.
[02:19:28.390 --> 02:19:29.531]  It's a cult.
[02:19:29.531 --> 02:19:30.772]  They're the new priesthood.
[02:19:30.772 --> 02:19:33.734]  They want to take over like Jim Jones or something or North Korea.
[02:19:33.734 --> 02:19:37.478]  And then Trump wants to break the cult by prosperity and independence.
[02:19:37.478 --> 02:19:37.678]  Yes.
[02:19:38.847 --> 02:19:51.337]  You know, when you were talking about your upbringing and my upbringing in the communist, progressive, Democrat world, was to see the world entirely in terms of oppression.
[02:19:51.337 --> 02:19:54.000]  There are people who are oppressed and there are oppressors.
[02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:58.523]  And as I said, that phrase, people of color, that's the key.
[02:19:58.523 --> 02:19:59.524]  It's not English.
[02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:02.926]  We don't say, here's a box of crayons of color.
[02:20:02.926 --> 02:20:06.008]  That's the way French people talk.
[02:20:06.008 --> 02:20:08.830]  But if you call them colored people, you're a racist.
[02:20:08.830 --> 02:20:13.674]  So what is the function of this ideological construct, people of color?
[02:20:13.674 --> 02:20:14.675]  Well, look at Mexico.
[02:20:14.675 --> 02:20:17.737]  It's got two main ethnic groups.
[02:20:18.217 --> 02:20:29.342]  The descendants of the Spanish conquistadors who slaughtered the indigenous Indians and the descendants of the survivors of the indigenous Indians.
[02:20:29.342 --> 02:20:38.866]  But when they cross the border into America, they're both people of color, therefore oppressed, therefore deserving certain sensitivities and certain privileges.
[02:20:38.866 --> 02:20:43.668]  But if you think further, maharajas in India are people of color.
[02:20:43.668 --> 02:20:46.409]  The beheaders, the Islamic beheaders in Raqqa,
[02:20:47.709 --> 02:20:53.972]  Sure, I mean it's a way to just take classical racism that we've heard in the last 200 years here and just flip it.
[02:20:53.972 --> 02:20:55.333]  Exactly right.
[02:20:55.333 --> 02:21:02.897]  The only people in the world who aren't people of color and therefore are oppressors, not oppressed, are white people.
[02:21:02.897 --> 02:21:09.740]  This is a massive anti-white racism that the Democratic Party, that's what it's about.
[02:21:09.740 --> 02:21:14.222]  They look at your origins, it's why they do all these gotcha moments.
[02:21:15.475 --> 02:21:19.016]  I've also found the left always gets caught funding the white supremacist movement.
[02:21:19.016 --> 02:21:23.098]  It's like the top guy will really be a federal agent and the people under him, they're running around.
[02:21:23.098 --> 02:21:24.358]  It's very sophisticated.
[02:21:24.358 --> 02:21:26.739]  Or Soros funding all the Black Lives Matter groups.
[02:21:26.739 --> 02:21:27.599]  I mean, what's all that about?
[02:21:27.599 --> 02:21:29.120]  Just, I guess, a strategy of tension?
[02:21:30.375 --> 02:21:34.018]  Well, blacks are the battering ram to destroy the system.
[02:21:34.018 --> 02:21:40.683]  Those blacks that follow organizations like Black Lives Matter is a racist organization.
[02:21:40.683 --> 02:21:43.025]  The left has always been anti-police.
[02:21:43.025 --> 02:21:44.446]  I mean, that's what we hated.
[02:21:44.446 --> 02:21:48.289]  The police are an occupying force in our country.
[02:21:48.289 --> 02:21:49.330]  That's the way the left looks.
[02:21:49.330 --> 02:21:54.734]  And the police can be good or bad, but the point is they want control in the bullying of the police and then persecute everybody.
[02:21:55.219 --> 02:21:58.523]  The police are bad because they protect property.
[02:21:58.523 --> 02:22:00.365]  And you have to think like a leftist.
[02:22:00.365 --> 02:22:02.207]  That's the way they think.
[02:22:02.207 --> 02:22:05.591]  So, Black Lives Matter, of course Soros is funding them.
[02:22:05.591 --> 02:22:09.856]  Soros is an anti-American, self-hating Jew is what he is.
[02:22:09.856 --> 02:22:11.218]  Yeah, what is his problem?
[02:22:11.218 --> 02:22:11.438]  I mean...
[02:22:12.379 --> 02:22:14.841]  This country gives him freedom, everything, and he tries to destroy it.
[02:22:14.841 --> 02:22:19.324]  His problem is he's a very corrupt individual.
[02:22:19.324 --> 02:22:22.646]  By the way, the WikiLeaks came out, but you called him a self-hating Jew a long time ago.
[02:22:22.646 --> 02:22:36.396]  It's in there that he wants to destroy Israel and is creeping around, and then Israel has all these articles defending him and attacking Trump and a lot of their newspapers, like Haaretz, making up crap that I like Hitler with no proof and that he likes Hitler.
[02:22:36.396 --> 02:22:37.536]  What is going on with that?
[02:22:37.536 --> 02:22:41.199]  Like a Nazi collaborator wants to destroy Israel, but he's good in Israel.
[02:22:41.519 --> 02:22:43.919]  And then I don't want to destroy Israel, so I'm Hitler.
[02:22:43.919 --> 02:22:45.020]  Those are their weapons.
[02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:46.740]  They don't care about the facts.
[02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:49.221]  They're not interested in the facts.
[02:22:49.221 --> 02:22:53.942]  They see the world as polarized between the oppressors and the oppressed.
[02:22:53.942 --> 02:23:02.823]  And if you defend America... So it doesn't matter if it's a leftist Jew, or a leftist guy from Africa, or who it is, they just think the same.
[02:23:02.823 --> 02:23:03.663]  Exactly.
[02:23:03.663 --> 02:23:05.124]  Exactly.
[02:23:05.124 --> 02:23:06.244]  Across the world.
[02:23:06.244 --> 02:23:09.385]  Why are they so soft on Islamic terrorists?
[02:23:09.385 --> 02:23:10.965]  Because they're people of color.
[02:23:12.546 --> 02:23:13.606]  That's crazy.
[02:23:13.606 --> 02:23:21.388]  Well, David Horowitz, let's talk about ways, your top points, because I'm asking the questions here, but I'm sure you've got a lot of key points you want to make.
[02:23:21.388 --> 02:23:40.032]  The six, seven minutes we have left, advice to Trump, advice to America, because I mean, you are somebody that really was the first person I heard about the caliphate and Sharia law, and the left's made a deal, and I was just like, give me a break, because I never thought they would just trash a lot of their leftist views of freedom and equality that sounded good, but I guess that was their way to get power.
[02:23:40.032 --> 02:23:40.832]  That was all just talk.
[02:23:42.265 --> 02:23:56.574]  You know, I understand your puzzlement, because even I, when Saddam Hussein swallowed Kuwait, and if you'll remember, I mean, the Democrats did not want to support even that war.
[02:23:58.255 --> 02:24:06.959]  I waited to see if the, I said, is the left really going to support Saddam Hussein, this mass murderer monster?
[02:24:06.959 --> 02:24:08.520]  And sure enough, they did.
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:12.642]  They've supported every enemy of the United States since the Second World War.
[02:24:12.642 --> 02:24:15.403]  That's just who they are.
[02:24:15.403 --> 02:24:16.423]  They hate America.
[02:24:16.423 --> 02:24:19.084]  So, you know them better than most, to say the least.
[02:24:19.084 --> 02:24:21.466]  David Horowitz, the Big Agenda bestselling author.
[02:24:21.466 --> 02:24:22.066]  What do they do next?
[02:24:23.783 --> 02:24:28.993]  Well, I think they're going to carry out this campaign until they destroy the Trump presidency.
[02:24:28.993 --> 02:24:29.995]  And what does he do to stop them?
[02:24:31.707 --> 02:24:34.948]  Well, instinctively he knows how to fight.
[02:24:34.948 --> 02:24:38.009]  You have to be the aggressor.
[02:24:38.009 --> 02:24:40.910]  You have to be on offense all the time.
[02:24:40.910 --> 02:24:42.271]  Do not defend yourself.
[02:24:42.271 --> 02:24:48.033]  The mistakes they've made were mistakes that Trump allowed himself to be overridden.
[02:24:48.033 --> 02:24:48.773]  They should never have.
[02:24:48.773 --> 02:24:49.293]  Exactly.
[02:24:49.293 --> 02:24:51.714]  I'm not just kissing Trump's ass, it's true.
[02:24:51.714 --> 02:24:52.574]  Every mistake's been them.
[02:24:52.574 --> 02:24:54.335]  Like he didn't tell Sessions to recuse.
[02:24:54.335 --> 02:24:55.995]  He didn't apologize.
[02:24:55.995 --> 02:24:57.076]  He reversed that.
[02:24:57.076 --> 02:25:01.097]  And he needs to tell his people, you do what I execute and say, not what you want.
[02:25:01.690 --> 02:25:12.836]  And it wasn't his idea to go with the second immigration, you know, temporary ban either and eliminate Iraq from the countries.
[02:25:12.836 --> 02:25:14.997]  They should have constructed it a little better.
[02:25:14.997 --> 02:25:18.239]  Because they're not dealing on the other side that wants to make compromises.
[02:25:18.239 --> 02:25:20.661]  They want to literally overrun everything.
[02:25:20.661 --> 02:25:21.261]  Exactly.
[02:25:21.886 --> 02:25:27.109]  They're not, they're not, they're not, when you compromise, you're just giving the, it's, you know, it's not compromise.
[02:25:27.109 --> 02:25:29.431]  It's Neville Chamberlain all over again.
[02:25:29.431 --> 02:25:30.451]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:30.451 --> 02:25:31.632]  Uh, you know, I have a letter from Hitler.
[02:25:31.632 --> 02:25:32.673]  He's not going to invade France.
[02:25:32.673 --> 02:25:34.094]  And then he invades it a week later.
[02:25:34.094 --> 02:25:35.835]  So, so going back to this, the time we have left.
[02:25:35.835 --> 02:25:43.180]  The racist party, that's the first words that need to be on every Republican's lips.
[02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:45.441]  Uh, there's a chapter in my book, Big Agenda.
[02:25:45.441 --> 02:25:48.363]  Well, that's what got Trump in, was being honest about the Democrats being a race-based party.
[02:25:49.909 --> 02:25:51.950]  Yeah, but he was right.
[02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:53.411]  And they just keep driving it home.
[02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:55.271]  And again, we're not saying it's racist.
[02:25:55.271 --> 02:25:56.792]  Hey, this is a race-baiting party.
[02:25:56.792 --> 02:25:58.193]  You shouldn't be in it if you're part of that.
[02:25:58.193 --> 02:26:00.674]  It's worse than that, Alex.
[02:26:00.674 --> 02:26:04.635]  The chapter of my book is called The Achilles Heel of the Democratic Party.
[02:26:04.635 --> 02:26:09.938]  The Democratic Party owns every major inner city in America.
[02:26:09.938 --> 02:26:11.639]  Every killing field.
[02:26:11.639 --> 02:26:15.540]  Detroit, Chicago, Ferguson, St.
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:16.961]  Louis, Baltimore.
[02:26:17.682 --> 02:26:19.826]  100% controlled by the Democratic Party.
[02:26:19.826 --> 02:26:20.687]  And they're hellholes!
[02:26:20.687 --> 02:26:21.288]  It's their fault!
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:22.900]  Exactly.
[02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:27.743]  And look, they're very clever at the political battle.
[02:26:27.743 --> 02:26:36.687]  So when he says there's these killing fields, they say he's being racist against the inner city, running down the inner city.
[02:26:36.687 --> 02:26:38.468]  It's so absurd.
[02:26:38.468 --> 02:26:40.109]  But people can see that.
[02:26:40.109 --> 02:26:45.911]  But I don't hear Republicans saying that Debbie Wasserman Schultz or Donna Brazile- Exactly.
[02:26:45.911 --> 02:26:46.752]  They're intimidated.
[02:26:46.752 --> 02:26:47.612]  Trump's not.
[02:26:47.612 --> 02:26:51.314]  Don't they see from his example, not being intimidated when you have the moral high ground as the answer?
[02:26:52.014 --> 02:27:02.918]  Here's the thing, Alex, when you think about it, the three key people in that administration, Donald Trump, Stephen Bannon, and Steve Miller, all come from the left.
[02:27:02.918 --> 02:27:07.459]  They're all, uh, we're in, really, Democrat Union.
[02:27:07.459 --> 02:27:09.860]  They know how to respond back.
[02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:12.121]  They have the passion.
[02:27:12.121 --> 02:27:13.021]  No, you're right.
[02:27:13.021 --> 02:27:20.824]  The so-called right-winger, a bunch of stuffed shirts, a bunch of cowards, a bunch of accountants, who literally just roll over to the media and are scared of it, and have no instincts for victory.
[02:27:20.824 --> 02:27:21.444]  You're absolutely right.
[02:27:22.665 --> 02:27:27.228]  And my book, Big Agenda, is really a guide to how to fight this battle.
[02:27:27.228 --> 02:27:30.571]  But the first rule is you fight fire with fire.
[02:27:30.571 --> 02:27:32.112]  You don't retreat.
[02:27:32.112 --> 02:27:33.693]  You don't back down.
[02:27:33.693 --> 02:27:35.854]  And you go for their jugular.
[02:27:35.854 --> 02:27:43.059]  They're the ones who own all... How many blacks have been murdered because of Democrats in this country?
[02:27:43.059 --> 02:27:45.081]  It's like 3,000 a year in Chicago and they blame it on Trump.
[02:27:46.071 --> 02:27:46.712]  Exactly.
[02:27:46.712 --> 02:27:58.808]  They have these gun control laws in Chicago and other Democrat cities that deprive law-abiding black citizens in high-crime areas of the only protection that they'll get.
[02:27:58.808 --> 02:28:00.950]  And then they wonder why the areas are crime magnets.
[02:28:01.471 --> 02:28:04.992]  They have catch-and-release policies for convicted felons.
[02:28:04.992 --> 02:28:09.433]  That's how Dwayne Wade's cousin, a mother of four children, was murdered.
[02:28:09.433 --> 02:28:12.994]  And then they know they've been destroying black communities in every other community they control.
[02:28:12.994 --> 02:28:16.335]  They turn it all around about a race narrative to project on everybody what they've done.
[02:28:16.335 --> 02:28:18.096]  They consciously know they're slugs.
[02:28:18.616 --> 02:28:20.819]  You're a liar and a crook, which he is both.
[02:28:34.597 --> 02:28:37.019]  Either too polite or too cowardly to do it.
[02:28:37.019 --> 02:28:37.959]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:28:37.959 --> 02:28:43.983]  Yeah, Trump's only thing is letting his people speak for him, and these Gallup polls are fake, like I told everybody during the election, they're fake.
[02:28:43.983 --> 02:28:45.484]  They're going back to their fake polls.
[02:28:45.484 --> 02:28:48.967]  All right, well, David Hornowitz, the book's The Big Agenda, I've read it, it's amazing.
[02:28:48.967 --> 02:28:52.269]  I have a website called Black Book of the American Left.
[02:28:52.269 --> 02:28:59.894]  I've written seven, actually, it'll be nine volumes when it's complete, just about the left and how they think.
[02:29:01.006 --> 02:29:03.510]  I'd be happy to send you a set if there is.
[02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:16.560]  I hope so.
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:18.801]  I fear that they're going to assassinate him.
[02:29:18.801 --> 02:29:19.981]  Yeah, I got a bad feeling.
[02:29:19.981 --> 02:29:22.422]  I'm trying to be positive here, but it's 50-50.
[02:29:22.422 --> 02:29:28.524]  I think it's up to us and what we do now, how much we speak out, how much we get involved.
[02:29:28.524 --> 02:29:30.504]  Everybody out there, get out and fight.
[02:29:30.504 --> 02:29:31.484]  Fight at every level.
[02:29:31.484 --> 02:29:33.285]  Go to those town hall meetings.
[02:29:33.285 --> 02:29:34.625]  Confront them.
[02:29:34.625 --> 02:29:37.026]  Defend Trump and his agendas.
[02:29:37.426 --> 02:29:37.986]  Sure, David.
[02:29:37.986 --> 02:29:42.530]  On drugs, we have a report with NSA documents that were spying on Trump.
[02:29:42.530 --> 02:29:42.850]  Proven.
[02:29:42.850 --> 02:29:44.251]  I hope you'll get those out to your audience.
[02:29:44.251 --> 02:29:45.852]  We've also got to work together as patriots.
[02:29:45.852 --> 02:29:46.893]  Thank you so much, David.
[02:29:46.893 --> 02:29:47.493]  We'll be back.
[02:29:47.493 --> 02:29:47.873]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.873 --> 02:29:48.894]  Roger Stone with breaking news.
[02:29:48.894 --> 02:29:50.235]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.235 --> 02:29:52.757]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.757 --> 02:29:55.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.793 --> 02:30:07.478]  The House Intelligence Committee hearing today on Russia and the 2016 elections has been quite the fake news, anti-Trump, double standard ceremony.
[02:30:07.478 --> 02:30:13.102]  Led by the anti-Trump team of Schiff, Comey, and Nunes, the 2020 Globalist Democrat campaign for U.S.
[02:30:13.102 --> 02:30:14.322]  President has begun.
[02:30:14.322 --> 02:30:19.426]  Admiral Rogers of the NSA could not answer many questions due to national security and classified information.
[02:30:19.426 --> 02:30:22.828]  The hearing was loaded with canned questions, responses, and lawyer talk.
[02:30:22.828 --> 02:30:27.391]  The Trump-Russia narrative echoed with, there was no wiretapping, attacks peppered in.
[02:30:27.631 --> 02:30:28.672]  So now, U.S.
[02:30:28.672 --> 02:30:38.405]  officials are discussing the investigation of Russian influence on the Trump campaign and the election, but at the same time attacking Trump for claiming he was being investigated by the U.S.
[02:30:38.405 --> 02:30:40.047]  government during these investigations.
[02:30:40.047 --> 02:30:41.409]  1984 double think in the flesh.
[02:30:43.271 --> 02:30:44.312]  Understand this.
[02:30:44.312 --> 02:30:48.834]  This hearing and all other related hearings or narratives are nothing more than the globalist Democrat U.S.
[02:30:48.834 --> 02:30:50.555]  presidential campaign for 2020.
[02:30:50.555 --> 02:30:56.819]  They will try to delegitimize President Trump with fake news, then attack him on it the entire 2020 campaign.
[02:30:56.819 --> 02:30:59.060]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.

[02:31:59.778 --> 02:32:01.619]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:32:01.619 --> 02:32:08.202]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:32:08.202 --> 02:32:11.384]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:11.384 --> 02:32:21.148]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:32:21.148 --> 02:32:22.009]  Caveman.
[02:32:22.009 --> 02:32:27.071]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:32:27.071 --> 02:32:29.172]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:29.472 --> 02:32:32.613]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:32.613 --> 02:32:37.773]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:37.773 --> 02:32:45.915]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:45.915 --> 02:32:53.856]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:53.856 --> 02:32:58.497]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forestlife.com today.
[02:33:07.791 --> 02:33:16.797]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:16.797 --> 02:33:23.060]  Listen to this guitar right here.
[02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:24.541]  I deserve this.
[02:33:24.541 --> 02:33:27.263]  You deserve to hear it too.
[02:33:27.263 --> 02:33:28.023]  Deep Purple.
[02:33:38.677 --> 02:33:41.459]  Right here.
[02:33:41.459 --> 02:33:44.142]  A lot better on hi-fi.
[02:33:44.142 --> 02:33:47.304]  Not on your AM radio.
[02:33:47.304 --> 02:33:56.072]  Listen to this.
[02:33:56.072 --> 02:34:00.215]  And right here.
[02:34:00.215 --> 02:34:01.496]  Yeah, baby!
[02:34:01.496 --> 02:34:03.058]  That's some of the best sound out there.
[02:34:03.058 --> 02:34:03.878]  That's the soul!
[02:34:03.878 --> 02:34:05.220]  Woo!
[02:34:08.112 --> 02:34:12.473]  Smoke on the water, fire in the sky.
[02:34:12.473 --> 02:34:16.775]  That's a good liner for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:16.775 --> 02:34:18.735]  We're going to Roger Stone with a second update today.
[02:34:18.735 --> 02:34:22.457]  He was, as of this morning, attacked him like seven or eight times.
[02:34:22.457 --> 02:34:24.897]  We've got three of the clips.
[02:34:24.897 --> 02:34:28.559]  I mean, I've studied this thing up one side and down the other, but now we've hit a new level.
[02:34:28.559 --> 02:34:30.599]  They've called me a Russian stooge.
[02:34:30.599 --> 02:34:35.701]  I've had McClatchy, that's a real investigative news journal group out of Florida, who does a lot of good work.
[02:34:36.684 --> 02:34:39.407]  Which is even crazier.
[02:34:39.407 --> 02:34:41.349]  Asking us, what do we know about the Russians?
[02:34:41.349 --> 02:34:42.350]  What are our contacts?
[02:34:42.350 --> 02:34:44.232]  Are we basically Russian agents?
[02:34:44.232 --> 02:34:47.075]  And do we have bots with the Russians?
[02:34:47.075 --> 02:34:50.619]  Greg Gordon, national correspondent.
[02:34:53.450 --> 02:35:03.512]  I mean, we got like 65 people that work here and one of them did come over here from Russia because her parents didn't like communism and she was in the US Army and is honorably discharged.
[02:35:03.512 --> 02:35:05.372]  Is it okay she's Russian?
[02:35:05.372 --> 02:35:06.672]  But other than that, there's no Russians.
[02:35:06.672 --> 02:35:08.113]  I haven't been to Russia or whatever.
[02:35:08.113 --> 02:35:09.273]  But I love how they turn around.
[02:35:09.273 --> 02:35:14.314]  Hillary's on the Russian payroll, which they do try to buy people off, that's what governments do.
[02:35:14.314 --> 02:35:15.954]  She's a communist Chinese agent.
[02:35:15.954 --> 02:35:21.875]  She's paid off all this crap, robs Haiti.
[02:35:21.875 --> 02:35:22.375]  And I've got
[02:35:23.362 --> 02:35:26.363]  Hi, I've left messages at every contact point I can find.
[02:35:26.363 --> 02:35:30.104]  Could you please put me in touch with the right person to respond to these questions?
[02:35:30.104 --> 02:35:31.604]  Well, here I am.
[02:35:31.604 --> 02:35:34.645]  Sources say the FBI-led inquiry into Russian meddling in the U.S.
[02:35:34.645 --> 02:35:45.048]  election has been examining whether conservative news sites, including InfoWars, had any contact with operatives for Russia who engaged in bot attacks that
[02:35:46.010 --> 02:35:48.091]  Heightened readership of your news stories.
[02:35:48.091 --> 02:35:49.612]  Do you have any comment?
[02:35:49.612 --> 02:35:50.813]  Well, yeah, let me comment.
[02:35:50.813 --> 02:35:57.657]  They said during the election that sites had bots supporting them, and that's how our news was popular.
[02:35:57.657 --> 02:36:01.580]  Our news was popular because we were the first to break Hillary Clinton falling down.
[02:36:01.580 --> 02:36:04.222]  You know, like, Drudge is the second biggest website in the world.
[02:36:04.222 --> 02:36:05.342]  Not just news site.
[02:36:05.342 --> 02:36:06.663]  Number one news site.
[02:36:06.663 --> 02:36:08.344]  Biggest news site in the world.
[02:36:08.344 --> 02:36:12.267]  Second biggest because he's been around since, like, 95, and he breaks a lot of big news.
[02:36:12.267 --> 02:36:12.587]  That's why.
[02:36:14.028 --> 02:36:23.333]  I'm so sick of you acting like we have giant audiences because we're racist, like Alec Baldwin said a week and a half ago on Saturday Night Live, Alex Jones hates black people.
[02:36:23.333 --> 02:36:26.215]  What the hell, man?
[02:36:26.215 --> 02:36:30.237]  I said I want to punch him in the nose for that, and he was like, he wants to punch him in the nose for no reason.
[02:36:30.237 --> 02:36:30.877]  No!
[02:36:30.877 --> 02:36:34.939]  He said playing Donald Trump, I learned black people aren't humans from Alex Jones.
[02:36:34.939 --> 02:36:36.020]  What the hell?
[02:36:40.549 --> 02:36:45.290]  I saw some story about some famous white supremacist, I even forget his name, a few days ago with Watson.
[02:36:45.290 --> 02:36:47.150]  Watson's always attacking him.
[02:36:47.150 --> 02:36:49.971]  And it said, oh, Infowars break up with the KKK.
[02:36:49.971 --> 02:36:50.991]  A break up?
[02:36:50.991 --> 02:36:55.472]  We were never with them, you, the Democrats with the KKK.
[02:36:55.472 --> 02:37:00.673]  My point is, they're, I'm going to Roger right now, is they're reaching next level BS.
[02:37:00.673 --> 02:37:05.173]  How the hell do you call up a McClatchy writer and say, no, we haven't had contacts with Russians?
[02:37:05.173 --> 02:37:06.354]  Oh, well, you went on RT.
[02:37:06.354 --> 02:37:07.734]  Yeah, and I've been on the BBC.
[02:37:09.377 --> 02:37:10.518]  There's my Russian connections.
[02:37:10.518 --> 02:37:13.801]  I've been on RT probably a hundred times or more.
[02:37:13.801 --> 02:37:16.564]  And I'll go on any channel that's got a big audience to talk about stuff.
[02:37:16.564 --> 02:37:19.727]  I'll go on, you know, Fox News, CNN, doesn't mean I agree with them.
[02:37:19.727 --> 02:37:26.153]  This whole ridiculous narrative of the bitching left that I'm involved with the Russians or Stone or Trump is, is a joke.
[02:37:27.102 --> 02:37:34.565]  Trump just dealt Russia the biggest blow of any sanctions ever, and he did it because America's first, not because he hates Russia.
[02:37:34.565 --> 02:37:41.008]  He just announced all the coals back on the table, and that screws all the elites and the Saudis, everybody, too, and it helps the American people.
[02:37:41.008 --> 02:37:45.189]  It cuts natural gas prices down to where it's not even worth the bumping on mother ground.
[02:37:45.189 --> 02:37:47.450]  See, I'm geopolitically involved.
[02:37:47.450 --> 02:37:49.111]  I'm informed, Greg Gordon.
[02:37:50.509 --> 02:38:01.756]  Donald Trump's got every other country and every other interest pissed, crapping their drawers, because he is gonna have America like a grizzly bear, get up on its hind legs, so everybody better get ready for that!
[02:38:01.756 --> 02:38:07.739]  The Russian bear ain't got crap on the American bear.
[02:38:07.739 --> 02:38:08.560]  Get ready for it!
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:12.202]  And the American Bull.
[02:38:12.202 --> 02:38:14.324]  Look at the stock market, three plus trillion.
[02:38:14.324 --> 02:38:20.951]  Everything, America, America, America's... We got somebody that said America's open for business!
[02:38:20.951 --> 02:38:24.335]  And America's the biggest, sexiest thing the world's ever seen.
[02:38:24.335 --> 02:38:29.220]  It's Marilyn Monroe, baby, in a bikini at her prime, ready to go.
[02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:31.041]  We're number one again!
[02:38:31.041 --> 02:38:31.962]  Get ready for it!
[02:38:31.962 --> 02:38:33.744]  David Rockefeller just died.
[02:38:33.744 --> 02:38:35.666]  Another beautiful godsend.
[02:38:35.666 --> 02:38:39.189]  That piece of trash created the UN to F our country over.
[02:38:39.189 --> 02:38:41.251]  So to all of you, let me explain one damn thing.
[02:38:41.251 --> 02:38:45.815]  I'm not going to sit here and say I'm not some Russian stooge because it's a GD lie.
[02:38:45.815 --> 02:38:51.300]  I'm going to tell everybody out there though, and I mean this, you say it and I find you on the street, I'm going to break your nose.
[02:38:51.300 --> 02:38:52.521]  You understand that?
[02:38:52.521 --> 02:38:53.843]  Because I've had enough of your crap.
[02:38:54.986 --> 02:38:57.207]  If I'm not America, nothing is!
[02:38:57.207 --> 02:38:59.369]  If Donald Trump isn't America, nothing is!
[02:38:59.369 --> 02:39:04.012]  If Roger Stone is not America, nothing is!
[02:39:04.012 --> 02:39:05.213]  America first!
[02:39:05.213 --> 02:39:06.433]  You heard that before?
[02:39:06.433 --> 02:39:06.894]  You heard of 1776?
[02:39:06.894 --> 02:39:13.158]  And let me tell all the Democrats of the Globalist something, because the thing goes on here.
[02:39:13.158 --> 02:39:16.580]  Did your news organization or its employees have communication with the Russian operatives?
[02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:17.360]  No!
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:19.802]  Involved with bots or trolls during the campaign?
[02:39:19.802 --> 02:39:20.482]  No!
[02:39:20.482 --> 02:39:21.743]  If so, can you describe them?
[02:39:21.743 --> 02:39:22.564]  No, dumbass!
[02:39:24.167 --> 02:39:28.161]  Have you been contacted by the FBI Congressional Intelligence Committees looking into Russian intelligence operations?
[02:39:28.885 --> 02:39:30.946]  They need to look into Hillary, no?
[02:39:30.946 --> 02:39:34.728]  If so, can you say when and describe the nature of their inquiries?
[02:39:34.728 --> 02:39:41.552]  They want the funding in shadow government blocking Trump to start surveilling and killing people with hit teams they insert within these groups.
[02:39:41.552 --> 02:39:44.173]  I told you this three months ago, they plan to kill everybody.
[02:39:44.173 --> 02:39:45.194]  Good luck!
[02:39:45.194 --> 02:39:49.636]  You guys start pulling your triggers, just walk on in your huckleberry, feel your hand.
[02:39:49.636 --> 02:39:54.359]  Because here's the deal, I don't really believe in the Hollywood movies, I am those, you understand that?
[02:39:54.359 --> 02:39:55.660]  So, not worried about Jack.
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:39:57.781]  In fact, I just can't wait if you go ahead and turn it up.
[02:39:58.999 --> 02:40:02.215]  I'm tired of sitting around with you people running your mouths all day.
[02:40:03.493 --> 02:40:06.294]  When you sold out to the shycoms in North Korea.
[02:40:06.294 --> 02:40:08.275]  How dare you filth!
[02:40:08.275 --> 02:40:14.337]  A message I sent earlier via the context section of InfoWars website might have inadvertently mentioned Steve Bennett.
[02:40:14.337 --> 02:40:15.778]  Obviously it was intended for Breitbart.
[02:40:15.778 --> 02:40:17.719]  Could you please hook me with the right person?
[02:40:17.719 --> 02:40:19.059]  Greg, you might be a good person.
[02:40:19.059 --> 02:40:21.600]  I've seen McClatchy actually do a lot of good work, okay?
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:22.081]  I'm serious.
[02:40:22.081 --> 02:40:24.061]  Some of the only mainstream stuff I've seen that's good.
[02:40:24.061 --> 02:40:26.743]  But I just, I cannot respond to this, okay?
[02:40:26.743 --> 02:40:30.004]  I cannot respond to asking if I'm a child molester, okay?
[02:40:31.144 --> 02:40:34.906]  If I got caught with a dead kid in my truck or something, I can see you asking the question.
[02:40:34.906 --> 02:40:36.387]  Dude!
[02:40:36.387 --> 02:40:39.629]  Dude, America kicked Hillary's ass and the Democrats.
[02:40:39.629 --> 02:40:41.410]  Not the damn Russians!
[02:40:41.410 --> 02:40:44.492]  Can you give me some credit here?
[02:40:44.492 --> 02:40:46.673]  We're the big swingin' Johnson, bro!
[02:40:46.673 --> 02:40:47.674]  Not the Russians!
[02:40:47.674 --> 02:40:49.174]  Get that through your head!
[02:40:49.174 --> 02:40:50.075]  We're back!
[02:40:50.075 --> 02:40:51.816]  You understand?
[02:40:51.816 --> 02:40:53.137]  Damn you to hell, all of ya!
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:58.264]  Sorry Roger, I just, I am getting so sick of this crap.
[02:40:58.264 --> 02:41:03.628]  And I'm so sick of them saying they had communication with you and the Russians, then Trump goes, oh that's illegal, you just leaked that.
[02:41:03.628 --> 02:41:06.171]  They go, oh actually there's no evidence there, and we never wiretapped.
[02:41:06.171 --> 02:41:14.318]  And a bunch of cowards on Capitol Hill, kissing ass because they want to be seen nice by the mainstream media that has no viewers, and it's a giant collapsed hoax!
[02:41:14.318 --> 02:41:18.481]  I want to call them on their hoax, and call them on all their crap, and I'm not going to start a war.
[02:41:18.481 --> 02:41:21.084]  But if they want one, let's just get it going!
[02:41:21.084 --> 02:41:21.444]  Go ahead.
[02:41:23.035 --> 02:41:25.538]  Alex, great to be with you.
[02:41:25.538 --> 02:41:27.440]  Look, it's been quite a morning.
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:29.763]  Yeah, you're all over the news, there's a GD Russian agent!
[02:41:30.236 --> 02:41:36.739]  Yeah, no, I have seen the hearings this morning.
[02:41:36.739 --> 02:41:45.343]  First, let me say, for the many people who have contacted me after the hit-and-run accident of last week... Dan, you got hit with polonium.
[02:41:45.343 --> 02:41:46.703]  They're trying to kill you ahead of these hearings.
[02:41:46.703 --> 02:41:47.924]  You said that months ago.
[02:41:47.924 --> 02:41:49.104]  But I'm feeling fine.
[02:41:49.104 --> 02:41:51.325]  I still have a bit of a bruise.
[02:41:51.325 --> 02:41:54.347]  I am having some blurred vision in my right eye.
[02:41:54.347 --> 02:41:55.127]  You got a concussion.
[02:41:55.847 --> 02:42:02.493]  The same eye that I had a retinal detachment from a boxing mishap a year and a half ago.
[02:42:02.493 --> 02:42:05.596]  So in any event, I will be fine.
[02:42:05.596 --> 02:42:11.061]  This morning I witnessed the worst kind of mudslinging.
[02:42:11.961 --> 02:42:18.946]  Of red baiting, of McCarthyism by Congressman Adam Schiff.
[02:42:18.946 --> 02:42:28.733]  His line of questioning was reckless, it was pejoratively worded, and it leaves a totally false impression.
[02:42:28.733 --> 02:42:37.480]  The inference that my now fully disclosed and benign exchange with Crucifer 2.0
[02:42:39.694 --> 02:42:49.856]  Uh, constitutes collusion in anything, uh, is disproved by the content, the facts, and the timeline.
[02:42:49.856 --> 02:42:55.177]  And we know that, but here's the thing, they changed the subject from what's in WikiLeaks, with all their criminal activity, onto us.
[02:42:55.177 --> 02:42:58.377]  We're all clamoring like the media was for the latest WikiLeaks.
[02:42:58.377 --> 02:43:02.678]  It's like Como said on CNN, only CNN's allowed to look at this, you can't.
[02:43:02.678 --> 02:43:03.198]  No!
[02:43:03.198 --> 02:43:04.558]  They look at it, we look at it.
[02:43:04.558 --> 02:43:07.039]  I mean, what the, they just changed the subject, man!
[02:43:07.699 --> 02:43:13.040]  Well, there is no question, and Alex, I'm the one whose civil rights have been violated.
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:14.741]  They hit you with a FISA!
[02:43:14.741 --> 02:43:20.742]  I am the one whose privacy rights have been violated.
[02:43:20.742 --> 02:43:26.244]  They have systematically leaked this information to the New York Times, to the Smoking Gun,
[02:43:27.925 --> 02:43:29.747]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:43:29.747 --> 02:43:41.680]  They take massive NSA database collection of everything you do, find stuff where you've talked to people saying, oh I'm glad you didn't get banned off the internet or whatever, and then they put it in the newspaper and that's not even an issue when they're admittedly surveilling it.
[02:43:42.261 --> 02:43:43.622]  Well, and here's the real irony.
[02:43:43.622 --> 02:43:46.805]  They accuse us of utilizing Russian bots.
[02:43:46.805 --> 02:43:48.286]  Please give me a break.
[02:43:48.286 --> 02:44:00.738]  If one would simply go online now and do a search under Roger Stone or Alex Jones, but particularly, for some reason, Roger Stone, you will see a torrent of hate.
[02:44:02.062 --> 02:44:11.071]  Kill him, decapitate him, he's a Nazi, he's a bigot, he's going to be perp-walked to jail.
[02:44:11.071 --> 02:44:14.334]  We'll see how this works.
[02:44:14.334 --> 02:44:18.739]  I'm going to see if these congressmen can handle the truth.
[02:44:18.739 --> 02:44:20.540]  I demand the opportunity
[02:44:21.341 --> 02:44:24.263]  Oh, by the way, they can't really block you, can they?
[02:44:24.263 --> 02:44:27.025]  You should be at the National Press Club two days from now.
[02:44:27.025 --> 02:44:33.450]  You should go totally ape, and you should demand that you have equal time on every news channel to sit there and take these assholes on.
[02:44:33.450 --> 02:44:36.092]  Well, and John McCain's back in the act again.
[02:44:36.092 --> 02:44:40.075]  Yesterday, he says again, Stone must come before the Senate to explain his ties to Russia.
[02:44:40.075 --> 02:44:40.856]  I want to testify!
[02:44:40.856 --> 02:44:41.916]  I want to testify!
[02:44:41.916 --> 02:44:42.877]  I'll go with you!
[02:44:42.877 --> 02:44:43.618]  I hope they call me!
[02:44:44.418 --> 02:44:47.239]  So, Senator, you said this a week ago.
[02:44:47.239 --> 02:44:53.482]  I published a piece at the Daily Caller pointing out why that was a reckless, and you repeated it again.
[02:44:53.482 --> 02:44:54.762]  You've now doubled down.
[02:44:54.762 --> 02:44:56.863]  So here's what I would request.
[02:44:56.863 --> 02:45:12.689]  Since you, sir, are not a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, but since any member of the Senate has the right to sit in for that hearing, please do the courtesy to me of sitting in and taking your turn asking questions.
[02:45:15.636 --> 02:45:18.397]  I remember how happy you were on inauguration day that Trump was getting in.
[02:45:18.397 --> 02:45:19.697]  Your big dream, his dream, all this.
[02:45:19.697 --> 02:45:22.738]  You were the first guy reportedly to mention it to him, but that's admitted in the news.
[02:45:22.738 --> 02:45:24.838]  Nixon said that, said it to Reagan.
[02:45:24.838 --> 02:45:27.019]  You saw the vision, and now it's here.
[02:45:27.019 --> 02:45:32.140]  And you also did that 10-minute interview, or 9-minute interview we did where you said, they say they have the wiretaps, they say they have the proof.
[02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:33.561]  Alex never talked to Russians.
[02:45:33.561 --> 02:45:34.881]  Release it right now!
[02:45:34.881 --> 02:45:38.882]  Well, then Nunes says, actually we looked at it, there's not even phone calls with Roger Stone or Manafort and the Russians.
[02:45:39.622 --> 02:45:47.364]  All there is is Flynn, once he's supposed to set up calls for Trump, a week before, you know, that 20th article, with Rosenberg writing all these articles.
[02:45:47.364 --> 02:45:50.485]  I mean, it's the craziest crap where everything you said came true.
[02:45:50.485 --> 02:45:53.686]  You're like, there's no, there's no calls because I didn't do them.
[02:45:53.686 --> 02:45:59.028]  The House Intelligence Committee says there's no calls with you, but they have a Senate hearing where you're like the devil.
[02:46:00.636 --> 02:46:01.836]  You're exactly right, Alex.
[02:46:01.836 --> 02:46:04.038]  I apologize for adjusting my glasses.
[02:46:04.038 --> 02:46:08.441]  Frankly, this is the only thing that temporarily helps my right eye.
[02:46:08.441 --> 02:46:10.302]  They're very nice tortoise shell glasses.
[02:46:10.302 --> 02:46:12.463]  I do have an appointment with an eye specialist.
[02:46:12.463 --> 02:46:16.186]  Are those called Mr. Magoo's Specials?
[02:46:16.186 --> 02:46:20.309]  No, these are kind of your Minister of Truth.
[02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:21.369]  I know, I'm teasing you.
[02:46:21.369 --> 02:46:22.590]  You have great style.
[02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:25.272]  Today I'm doing the whole Minister of Truth thing.
[02:46:25.672 --> 02:46:28.894]  No, but is it surreal for you in your 40 plus years in politics and life?
[02:46:28.894 --> 02:46:33.556]  You've been all over the news many times, many New York Times articles, dozens of them before any of this.
[02:46:33.556 --> 02:46:39.959]  What is it like to be in the middle of this with them claiming you're a Russian super spy and the Russians are the reason Trump won and all this crap?
[02:46:39.959 --> 02:46:42.760]  I mean, the FBI admitted today no evidence of them hacking voting machines.
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:46.602]  We know that was Homeland Security for Hillary, stealing at least five states, trying to steal six others.
[02:46:47.442 --> 02:46:50.804]  Uh, but I mean, just giving mythical... It's very, it's very simple, Alex.
[02:46:50.804 --> 02:46:54.225]  I am jonesing for the opportunity to correct the historical record.
[02:46:54.225 --> 02:46:56.266]  It's not going down this way.
[02:46:56.266 --> 02:46:57.627]  This is a fraud.
[02:46:57.627 --> 02:47:07.411]  I understand that this whole Crucifer thing has manipulated to create a headline that says, Trump associate communicated with Russian hacker.
[02:47:08.297 --> 02:47:10.519]  It's not technically true.
[02:47:10.519 --> 02:47:12.581]  It's purposely misleading.
[02:47:12.581 --> 02:47:20.527]  Once that is up, you put it up on a bunch of dummy sites, then a bunch of left-wing, pay-for-play, fake news sites.
[02:47:20.527 --> 02:47:26.372]  You blend in some information that's clearly been leaked by the intelligence agencies.
[02:47:26.372 --> 02:47:31.697]  George Soros and David Brock and their bots pick up the meme.
[02:47:33.038 --> 02:47:34.440]  Uh, and you're off to the races.
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:38.285]  They have accused me of being, uh, they've accused me of treason.
[02:47:38.285 --> 02:47:45.314]  Uh, but it's the American way to have your right to, uh, to face your accuser.
[02:47:45.314 --> 02:47:46.736]  I look forward to that day.
[02:47:50.376 --> 02:47:51.977]  Roger Stone, I want to play a clip.
[02:47:51.977 --> 02:47:53.818]  This is Comey.
[02:47:53.818 --> 02:47:54.859]  We didn't do this on purpose.
[02:47:54.859 --> 02:47:57.181]  The clip we found, people put a tinfoil hat on his head.
[02:47:57.181 --> 02:47:57.881]  But here's the first clip.
[02:47:57.881 --> 02:47:59.923]  We've got two of them where you get brought up.
[02:47:59.923 --> 02:48:03.786]  And he won't say you're not the subject of an investigation because he won't get into the investigation.
[02:48:03.786 --> 02:48:08.009]  And I mean, it is just, and now again, McClatchy and others are calling me, asking me if I'm a Ruski.
[02:48:09.009 --> 02:48:14.214]  I mean, as if we didn't build InfoWars, as if we don't have a huge audience, as if the American people didn't win this election.
[02:48:14.214 --> 02:48:18.138]  Despite everything they did, the collusion, the WikiLeaks, it's just crazy.
[02:48:18.138 --> 02:48:21.761]  We need Trump and others to change the subject back to the real issue.
[02:48:21.761 --> 02:48:27.046]  Plus, there's a big bombshell on DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com that no one's touching.
[02:48:27.046 --> 02:48:31.910]  I'll ask you about that after the clip about him being spied on by the NSA.
[02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:33.071]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:48:34.452 --> 02:48:36.434]  Again, great again, oil drops as U.S.
[02:48:36.434 --> 02:48:38.615]  drilling growth threatens to counter OPEC.
[02:48:38.615 --> 02:48:40.697]  Again, I mean, Trump is just dominating.
[02:48:40.697 --> 02:48:41.497]  You want cheap oil?
[02:48:41.497 --> 02:48:42.258]  You want cheap gas?
[02:48:42.258 --> 02:48:43.138]  You want cheap electricity?
[02:48:43.138 --> 02:48:44.359]  You want to move to America?
[02:48:44.359 --> 02:48:46.240]  You want to, I mean, it's just, it's just, he's just doing it.
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:47.081]  America's open again!
[02:48:47.081 --> 02:48:48.322]  Everybody get out of the way!
[02:48:48.322 --> 02:48:51.043]  Here's the clip of Comey going after Roger Stone.
[02:48:51.043 --> 02:48:59.189]  I just want to follow up with a few questions about Roger Stone that I had started with earlier before I pass it to my colleagues.
[02:48:59.189 --> 02:49:02.211]  Director Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign?
[02:49:03.567 --> 02:49:07.271]  I'm not going to talk about any particular person here today, Mr. Schiff.
[02:49:07.271 --> 02:49:14.858]  I'm going to continue to ask you these questions because, among other things, I want to make sure you are aware of these facts, so whether you're able to comment on them or not.
[02:49:14.858 --> 02:49:21.164]  Have you read press reports where Mr. Stone proudly boasts of engaging in political dirty tricks?
[02:49:21.164 --> 02:49:22.225]  I'll give you the same answer, sir.
[02:49:24.457 --> 02:49:37.225]  I mentioned before that Mr. Stone was in direct communication with the creature of Russian GRU, Guccifer 2, and that's something the intelligence assessment talked about, the role of Guccifer 2.
[02:49:37.225 --> 02:49:46.090]  Mr. Stone, on August 17th, received a communication from Guccifer 2 that said, quote, I'm pleased to say that you are great.
[02:49:46.090 --> 02:49:49.412]  Please tell me if I can help you anyhow.
[02:49:49.412 --> 02:49:50.993]  It would be a great pleasure to me.
[02:49:50.993 --> 02:49:52.374]  Well, Comey really thinks he's the president.
[02:49:53.476 --> 02:49:55.718]  Bureaucracy is so disgusting.
[02:49:55.718 --> 02:49:58.781]  Why don't you just get the government off our back?
[02:49:58.781 --> 02:49:59.181]  Same answer.
[02:49:59.181 --> 02:49:59.641]  Same answer.
[02:49:59.641 --> 02:50:02.204]  Hit pause.
[02:50:10.523 --> 02:50:12.384]  He never said that.
[02:50:12.384 --> 02:50:14.105]  But, I mean, he's on O'Reilly.
[02:50:14.105 --> 02:50:15.846]  He's on Sean Hannity.
[02:50:15.846 --> 02:50:17.127]  He's on CNN.
[02:50:17.127 --> 02:50:18.028]  He's on everywhere.
[02:50:18.028 --> 02:50:21.150]  I mean, of course, we've tried to get him on.
[02:50:21.150 --> 02:50:23.211]  Stone was talking to somebody that was going to visit him.
[02:50:23.211 --> 02:50:24.332]  That's what you do as a journalist.
[02:50:24.332 --> 02:50:25.132]  Hey, you ask Assange.
[02:50:25.132 --> 02:50:33.057]  It's like, we're not supposed to talk to anybody, but all these jerks can, because they're God, little bug eyes, little pervert eyes.
[02:50:33.057 --> 02:50:34.698]  I hate that congressman, that senator.
[02:50:34.698 --> 02:50:35.499]  Here, let's go back to the club.
[02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:41.521]  ...also claimed that he was in touch with an intermediary of Mr. Assange.
[02:50:41.521 --> 02:50:44.101]  Same answer.
[02:50:44.101 --> 02:50:46.342]  This is a question I think you can answer.
[02:50:46.342 --> 02:50:53.763]  Do you know whether the Russian intelligence services dealt directly with WikiLeaks, or whether they too used an intermediary?
[02:50:53.763 --> 02:50:55.403]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:50:55.403 --> 02:50:56.784]  WikiLeaks never got it from U.S.
[02:50:56.784 --> 02:50:57.284]  intelligence.
[02:50:57.284 --> 02:50:59.264]  They never got anything from the DNC.
[02:50:59.264 --> 02:51:00.924]  This is how you do lies, see?
[02:51:00.924 --> 02:51:03.065]  The lie is the statement.
[02:51:03.065 --> 02:51:04.785]  Russia didn't do anything with WikiLeaks.
[02:51:06.778 --> 02:51:10.720]  See how it's lies upon lies upon lies, where they all act all pissed.
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:13.381]  Mr. Schiff, representing the globalists, selling America out.
[02:51:13.381 --> 02:51:15.142]  Pissed they can't gang-rape the country.
[02:51:15.142 --> 02:51:16.742]  Pissed they can't get our guns.
[02:51:16.742 --> 02:51:18.643]  Pissed their abortuaries are in trouble.
[02:51:18.643 --> 02:51:20.844]  Pissed their whole program's going up in flames.
[02:51:20.844 --> 02:51:23.265]  And he's up there claiming the patriots are with the Russians.
[02:51:23.265 --> 02:51:24.105]  Give me a break.
[02:51:24.105 --> 02:51:27.167]  Let's go back to this.
[02:51:27.167 --> 02:51:29.067]  We assess they used some kind of cutout.
[02:51:29.067 --> 02:51:34.490]  They didn't deal directly with WikiLeaks, in contrast to DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0.
[02:51:39.275 --> 02:51:47.021]  In early October, are you aware that Mr. Stone tweeted, I have total confidence that my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon?
[02:51:47.021 --> 02:51:49.603]  Are you aware of that tweet?
[02:51:49.603 --> 02:51:51.104]  I'm back to my original same answer.
[02:51:51.104 --> 02:51:53.265]  Hey, pause!
[02:51:53.265 --> 02:51:55.547]  Assange was in the news saying big stuff coming next week.
[02:51:55.547 --> 02:51:59.150]  Remember he wouldn't do it and he drug it out over like a month and I was getting pissed at Assange.
[02:51:59.150 --> 02:52:02.012]  Saying he was like a, you know the term I use, a little bit profane.
[02:52:02.785 --> 02:52:04.906]  I mean, they just take innocuous stuff.
[02:52:04.906 --> 02:52:07.107]  Let's go back to Roger Stone, and we'll finish up with more of this.
[02:52:07.107 --> 02:52:09.608]  I mean, we've got like six or seven of these clips now.
[02:52:09.608 --> 02:52:10.308]  It just goes on and on.
[02:52:10.308 --> 02:52:12.349]  Roger Stone, Roger Stone.
[02:52:12.349 --> 02:52:13.229]  I was on air with you.
[02:52:13.229 --> 02:52:15.930]  I was talking to you off air while they were recording, we now learn.
[02:52:15.930 --> 02:52:18.972]  All this totally innocuous about, yeah, I'm trying to get all the WikiLeaks.
[02:52:18.972 --> 02:52:21.333]  You are, as if that's some crime.
[02:52:21.333 --> 02:52:24.254]  Reckless, baseless, the worst.
[02:52:27.721 --> 02:52:33.887]  Just playing fast and loose with the truth.
[02:52:33.887 --> 02:52:42.294]  I mean, Alex, he claims I had direct, that I boasted of having direct contract with Assange.
[02:52:42.294 --> 02:52:43.035]  I didn't.
[02:52:43.035 --> 02:52:47.259]  You were always specific, but who cares if you did?
[02:52:47.259 --> 02:52:50.862]  Look, there's only one way to solve this.
[02:52:50.862 --> 02:52:52.544]  Mono a mono.
[02:52:53.763 --> 02:52:57.685]  You know, I feel like... So that's why they've been trying to kill you this week and before.
[02:52:57.685 --> 02:53:00.407]  They don't want you in the damn hearings!
[02:53:00.407 --> 02:53:06.710]  I am the one whose civil liberties have been hacked, and here is the problem.
[02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:19.858]  The deep state clearly was using surveillance on not only Trump aides, but I believe it will yet be proven on the man himself, both in Trump Tower and in Palm Beach.
[02:53:20.698 --> 02:53:36.393]  Notice, as soon as the President exposed that, the intelligence agencies began rapidly backing off their claim of Russian collusion, looking for some kind of standoff, in my opinion.
[02:53:36.393 --> 02:53:43.799]  So, we need to find out and establish whether this was done as a FISA court warrant, or if in fact,
[02:53:44.580 --> 02:54:03.210]  The Brits did this for Obama to keep it off the books as a cutout, very common arrangement among the services, and are now lying about it, which is what the cutout is supposed
[02:54:03.370 --> 02:54:03.851]  That's right.
[02:54:03.851 --> 02:54:05.995]  They've been caught with their pants down illegally spying.
[02:54:05.995 --> 02:54:07.478]  They got nothing with the spying.
[02:54:07.478 --> 02:54:11.866]  So now they're panicking, doubling down, saying there was no spying, but they have spying.
[02:54:11.866 --> 02:54:13.169]  You're a Russian agent.
[02:54:13.169 --> 02:54:14.491]  It's not going to work, Roger Stone.
[02:54:15.443 --> 02:54:23.607]  And I was unaware of allegations that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian asset when I wrote my piece for Breitbart.
[02:54:23.607 --> 02:54:27.688]  Had it been out there in the research, I would have written it.
[02:54:27.688 --> 02:54:30.369]  I was unaware of it when I reached out to the show.
[02:54:30.369 --> 02:54:32.970]  But by the way, you're a journalist writing about leaks.
[02:54:32.970 --> 02:54:34.951]  It's about the leaks, not who got them.
[02:54:34.951 --> 02:54:36.552]  You're doing this in newspapers.
[02:54:36.552 --> 02:54:43.855]  They act like when you mention Guccifer, like they found it in some secret deal and you're in some back alley selling, you know, nuclear launch codes.
[02:54:44.315 --> 02:54:51.879]  Well, and Mr. Schiff, yes, Julian Assange is a hero because he does not work for the Russians.
[02:54:51.879 --> 02:54:52.899]  Nice try.
[02:54:52.899 --> 02:54:57.541]  He does work against the deep state and the globalists.
[02:54:57.541 --> 02:55:00.863]  That is a rogue government that has captured the world and is now being defeated.
[02:55:00.863 --> 02:55:06.726]  And as each new nation pulls out, Italy, Russia, the UK, it doesn't matter, they claim all of us got it from the Russians.
[02:55:06.726 --> 02:55:10.948]  No, we don't want to be ruled by Goldman Sachs and a bunch of globalists that want us to be poor.
[02:55:10.948 --> 02:55:11.288]  Got it?
[02:55:11.448 --> 02:55:17.031]  We want prosperity and freedom and private property and family and God and the Second Amendment, jerks!
[02:55:17.031 --> 02:55:19.733]  That's why we're pissed, not because we're Russians!
[02:55:19.733 --> 02:55:20.834]  Understand, assholes?
[02:55:21.687 --> 02:55:26.429]  Well, and we're not going down without a fight, not a chance.
[02:55:26.429 --> 02:55:30.890]  So this whole Russian thing will be exposed.
[02:55:30.890 --> 02:55:33.671]  Ultimately, we've seen the part of this.
[02:55:33.671 --> 02:55:48.536]  We now know, according to an extraordinary piece of research by Dr. Jerry Corsi, that Donald Trump was in fact under surveillance in New York, in Trump Tower, in his palatial New York apartment.
[02:55:49.216 --> 02:55:58.240]  In Palm Beach, at the Mar-a-Lago Club, both under Bush, and later it continued under Obama.
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:02.502]  And it is essential in closing to get that out to the four corners of the planet.
[02:56:02.502 --> 02:56:05.663]  It's on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and DrudgeReport.com.
[02:56:05.663 --> 02:56:08.425]  And look, we're now close to 24 hours since this was published.
[02:56:08.425 --> 02:56:11.126]  Top link on Drudge, no coverage, and we got 60 seconds.
[02:56:11.126 --> 02:56:13.667]  What does that tell Roger Stone of how scared they are of this story?
[02:56:14.434 --> 02:56:20.557]  Well, this is the beginning of the surveillance of a future President of the United States.
[02:56:20.557 --> 02:56:30.561]  It comes from a CIA informant, and it also comes through a number of lawsuits filed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[02:56:30.561 --> 02:56:32.942]  Arpaio is not what's important here.
[02:56:32.942 --> 02:56:34.843]  He's a fine man.
[02:56:34.843 --> 02:56:42.287]  What's important in this case is that it provides stone-cold truth out of the database that first Bush
[02:56:43.127 --> 02:56:52.316]  And Obama, under two different meta data collecting programs, we're spying on a future president.
[02:56:52.316 --> 02:56:53.798]  And that's Dragnut and Sidewinder.
[02:56:53.798 --> 02:56:54.959]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone.
[02:56:55.814 --> 02:56:57.235]  But great to be here, Alex.
[02:56:57.235 --> 02:56:58.076]  Wow, what a time to be alive.
[02:56:58.076 --> 02:57:02.080]  We're going to take that little clip right there for the YouTube video on Facebook, guys, and put that piece right there on the front.
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:03.341]  That's powerful.
[02:57:03.341 --> 02:57:04.301]  Total Info War.
[02:57:04.301 --> 02:57:05.783]  My life is so exciting.
[02:57:05.783 --> 02:57:08.345]  Whatever happens, it's God's will.
[02:57:08.345 --> 02:57:11.047]  I mean, we're standing up against pure trash.
[02:57:11.047 --> 02:57:11.848]  David Knight's coming up.
[02:57:11.848 --> 02:57:15.952]  I want to get into David Rockefeller's death, the North Korea thing I haven't hit, and then turn it over to David Knight.
[02:57:15.952 --> 02:57:19.255]  I'm going to host at least 20 minutes of the next hour, then turn it over to David Knight.
[02:57:19.855 --> 02:57:21.155]  Don't worry, David will have his own show soon.
[02:57:21.155 --> 02:57:23.136]  We're going to watch more shows here soon in the next few months.
[02:57:23.136 --> 02:57:28.217]  We're getting all the board operators and producers set up for that.
[02:57:28.217 --> 02:57:29.258]  Wow.
[02:57:29.258 --> 02:57:31.898]  Just briefly, I didn't plug this hour, or did I?
[02:57:31.898 --> 02:57:34.339]  We need your financial support now more than ever.
[02:57:34.339 --> 02:57:36.420]  You can see we're having huge effects, breaking news.
[02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:37.660]  Nobody else is breaking.
[02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:39.500]  Changing the world thanks to your support.
[02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:48.083]  You get the very best products at very, very competitive prices and support a group completely committed like dogs in a hunt.
[02:57:49.031 --> 02:57:50.092]  I mean, you've seen a dog in a hunt.
[02:57:50.092 --> 02:57:53.116]  I mean, we're just, like, I mean, we're going all out here.
[02:57:53.116 --> 02:58:00.624]  You couldn't pull us off the fight, but we need the funding, we need the energy, we need the food, like a dog needs food and water to just attack for you.
[02:58:00.624 --> 02:58:01.805]  We want to attack.
[02:58:01.805 --> 02:58:02.827]  We want to be dog-like.
[02:58:02.827 --> 02:58:03.567]  We want this.
[02:58:03.567 --> 02:58:08.753]  This is absolute victory, what we're made for, we love it, but we need, we need the support, we need the prayers.
[02:58:09.634 --> 02:58:13.076]  So lift us up in prayer, please, and we've got 30 to 40% off.

[02:58:34.150 --> 02:58:34.931]  Thanks for coming through.
[02:58:34.931 --> 02:58:35.912]  And by the way, I forgot.
[02:58:35.912 --> 02:58:37.914]  Super Blue just came back in.
[02:58:37.914 --> 02:58:41.758]  Super Blue, the amazing fluoride-free toothpaste with iodine and a little silver.
[02:58:41.758 --> 02:58:44.000]  That just came in, but in limited supply.
[02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:44.881]  We don't get more for a month.
[02:58:44.881 --> 02:58:46.363]  This is a small supply.
[02:58:46.363 --> 02:58:47.103]  Support the broadcast.
[02:58:47.103 --> 02:58:47.564]  We need your help.
[02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:51.431]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:59:47.313 --> 02:59:52.217]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:52.217 --> 02:59:54.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.865 --> 03:00:13.528]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:00:13.528 --> 03:00:16.532]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:16.532 --> 03:00:18.835]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.238 --> 03:00:32.419]  Yeah, I'm 43, but my guts and my heart feel like I'm 18.
[03:00:32.419 --> 03:00:35.560]  My brain feels like I'm about 500 years old in a good way, if you know what I mean.
[03:00:35.560 --> 03:00:38.581]  There's David Knight, if you're a TV viewer, he's coming up in 20 minutes.
[03:00:38.581 --> 03:00:46.823]  He's got Mr. McAfee, of course, getting into all the NSA stuff and the hacking and the rest of it and the hearings today, so that's going to be coming up with David Knight in T-minus 20 minutes.
[03:00:46.823 --> 03:00:49.984]  I've got to hit the David Rockefeller situation.
[03:00:51.414 --> 03:00:59.679]  And his death coming up in the next segment, and I want to hit some of the North Korea news that I haven't properly covered, which is about as ominous as it gets.
[03:00:59.679 --> 03:01:03.481]  But all of us keep getting caught up, including Roger Stone, defending himself.
[03:01:03.481 --> 03:01:06.303]  Because I get it, they don't let him on any of these national shows, hardly.
[03:01:06.303 --> 03:01:11.166]  But they just call him a Russian agent with no evidence everywhere, and then just never let him on.
[03:01:11.166 --> 03:01:15.468]  And then they gets hit with polonium, they T-bone him, and he's a lot worse off than he's even saying on air.
[03:01:15.468 --> 03:01:16.529]  He's pretty bad.
[03:01:16.529 --> 03:01:18.670]  When he takes the glasses off, his eyes aren't pointing the right directions.
[03:01:20.919 --> 03:01:21.842]  I don't say that meanly.
[03:01:21.842 --> 03:01:23.507]  It's real sad.
[03:01:23.507 --> 03:01:25.111]  They want him dead before they have hearings.
[03:01:25.111 --> 03:01:26.395]  Well, they went ahead and still have the hearings.
[03:01:26.395 --> 03:01:27.097]  He's still alive.
[03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:29.821]  And they're trying to kill him.
[03:01:29.821 --> 03:01:32.402]  In fact, I think there's a good chance they're going to kill him real soon.
[03:01:32.402 --> 03:01:34.524]  They'll set the hearings up and he'll be poisoned or die.
[03:01:34.524 --> 03:01:37.585]  They'll say, oh, he's an old man, it's no big deal.
[03:01:37.585 --> 03:01:42.028]  This is the deep state that sold us out to China and others, trying to keep control of the country.
[03:01:42.028 --> 03:01:44.730]  And so all my reporters, myself too, we just keep arguing.
[03:01:44.730 --> 03:01:47.911]  They were in the New York Times admitting they'd wiretapped her.
[03:01:47.911 --> 03:01:51.614]  They said they had the communications and Trump pointed out, you just leaked, you had those in the press.
[03:01:51.614 --> 03:01:52.714]  That's a crime.
[03:01:52.714 --> 03:01:55.496]  So they get scared of that, get on the offense to change the subject.
[03:01:55.916 --> 03:01:57.477]  And then say, oh, but we weren't surveilling.
[03:01:57.477 --> 03:01:59.479]  And then say they never said that.
[03:01:59.479 --> 03:02:03.281]  We ought to play that CNN clip from last week where they say, it came from me.
[03:02:03.281 --> 03:02:04.122]  It came from you.
[03:02:04.122 --> 03:02:08.285]  But we need to just get back to the fact that they did surveil.
[03:02:08.285 --> 03:02:10.426]  They admitted they surveilled and found nothing.
[03:02:10.426 --> 03:02:12.208]  And the committee hearing says that's the case.
[03:02:14.284 --> 03:02:16.006]  We have several clips from the committee hearing.
[03:02:16.006 --> 03:02:18.548]  Let's play one of the first ones with Nunes.
[03:02:18.548 --> 03:02:22.492]  I don't know where my list is of clips.
[03:02:22.492 --> 03:02:28.457]  Saying today that, yeah, there's no evidence of any Russian contacts or hacking into the election.
[03:02:28.457 --> 03:02:29.097]  We know that!
[03:02:29.097 --> 03:02:30.419]  How insulting!
[03:02:30.419 --> 03:02:34.362]  All these foreign governments piled on against our election for Hillary.
[03:02:34.362 --> 03:02:39.327]  The public saw that and rejected it, just like Obama and others and Merkel went to England and said, don't go for the Brexit.
[03:02:39.327 --> 03:02:40.528]  People are sick of this crap!
[03:02:42.189 --> 03:02:45.131]  They're the foreign influence, they're the foreign outside group.
[03:02:45.131 --> 03:02:47.792]  They're the ones doing this, not us.
[03:02:47.792 --> 03:02:56.277]  But we just cover it, we keep covering myself, including the minutiae of it all, and they know how to just put out a false statement and have us respond to their BS.
[03:02:56.277 --> 03:02:58.318]  And then they keep doing it and doing it to keep us off.
[03:02:58.318 --> 03:03:01.260]  And I get we have to respond to the BS, but we have to move on.
[03:03:01.260 --> 03:03:04.122]  Because they know, and we know we're right, we'll obsess on it.
[03:03:04.980 --> 03:03:08.701]  We have to move on to, you got money from the Communist Chinese.
[03:03:08.701 --> 03:03:11.322]  You sold out to them, Hillary.
[03:03:11.322 --> 03:03:12.262]  You sold them the missiles.
[03:03:12.262 --> 03:03:15.203]  You gave North Korea the reactors.
[03:03:15.203 --> 03:03:17.583]  You're the traitors.
[03:03:17.583 --> 03:03:21.865]  You're the people surveilling the public illegally.
[03:03:21.865 --> 03:03:24.845]  Now, there's a New York Post, you can thank Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton for North Korean nukes.
[03:03:24.845 --> 03:03:26.346]  Well, Bill Clinton, really.
[03:03:26.346 --> 03:03:27.526]  It's just a fact.
[03:03:27.526 --> 03:03:28.506]  I mean, it's there.
[03:03:28.506 --> 03:03:29.027]  It's there.
[03:03:29.027 --> 03:03:30.747]  Just go after them.
[03:03:30.747 --> 03:03:32.567]  Trump just thinks he can turn the economy back on.
[03:03:32.567 --> 03:03:33.628]  They're going to leave him alone.
[03:03:33.628 --> 03:03:34.068]  No, they're not.
[03:03:35.069 --> 03:03:39.154]  Let's go to a clip of them talking about no Russian meddling in the physical election.
[03:03:39.154 --> 03:03:41.196]  The term hacking the election is a load of crap.
[03:03:41.196 --> 03:03:42.397]  Here it is.
[03:03:42.397 --> 03:03:51.447]  So my question as of today, Admiral Rogers, do you have any evidence that Russia's cyber actors changed vote tallies in the state of Michigan?
[03:03:52.791 --> 03:03:58.433]  No, I do not, but I would highlight we're a foreign intelligence organization, not a domestic intelligence organization.
[03:03:58.433 --> 03:03:59.894]  Oh yeah, you never responded, basically.
[03:03:59.894 --> 03:04:04.335]  We're probably not the best organization to provide a more complete answer.
[03:04:04.335 --> 03:04:06.016]  How about the state of Pennsylvania?
[03:04:06.016 --> 03:04:06.296]  No, sir.
[03:04:12.972 --> 03:04:19.375]  of just never stand up for the president, never stand up for the truth, just sit there and just say, but we'd be better off to answer that.
[03:04:19.375 --> 03:04:22.297]  No one has any evidence of any Russian hacking.
[03:04:22.297 --> 03:04:28.159]  It's Hillary and the DHS stole five states, hacked into six other states and got caught.
[03:04:28.159 --> 03:04:29.640]  Jerks.
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:31.241]  They have illegal aliens voting everywhere.
[03:04:33.166 --> 03:04:40.712]  And they try to tell us that hasn't happened while the Democrats in Operation, you know, Battleground Texas organize saying we're going to have illegals go vote.
[03:04:40.712 --> 03:04:46.957]  I'm sick of the lying arrogance and all these people we're fighting are like piles of dumb garbage.
[03:04:46.957 --> 03:04:50.080]  They're all little simpering crooks.
[03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:50.860]  Sick of the filth.
[03:04:50.860 --> 03:04:53.342]  I'm sick of the unchildrenless cowards.
[03:04:53.342 --> 03:04:54.763]  The age of man is returning.
[03:04:54.763 --> 03:04:56.665]  The age of the cowards is ending.
[03:04:56.665 --> 03:04:57.385]  Make no mistake.
[03:05:00.032 --> 03:05:03.135]  Robo Bezos!
[03:05:03.135 --> 03:05:08.940]  The CIA-affiliated owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, donned a robo suit straight out of Avatar.
[03:05:08.940 --> 03:05:15.266]  Bezos hopped in the pilot seat of the 13-foot mobile hunk of metal with arms and legs, mimicking those of a human's.
[03:05:15.266 --> 03:05:19.930]  He smiled for the cameras and said with a smile, Bow down before your new king and master!
[03:05:20.370 --> 03:05:25.652]  The robot he was operating is the Method 2, built by the South Korean company Hankook Marae.
[03:05:25.652 --> 03:05:30.573]  It operates with two joysticks to control the arms, and leg pedals to control the legs.
[03:05:30.573 --> 03:05:38.335]  The robot does still need support in order to stand, essentially still in training wheels, but the giant metal puppet is certainly turning heads in the tech industry.
[03:05:38.335 --> 03:05:40.016]  While it is all fun and games for now,
[03:05:40.336 --> 03:05:48.003]  Keep in mind, robot police are now a reality, with more law enforcement, including in the US, looking to robot police in the future.
[03:05:48.003 --> 03:05:52.587]  The military has also said it wants to move away from humans and more towards robots.
[03:05:52.587 --> 03:05:54.829]  Is the robo-arms race on?
[03:05:54.829 --> 03:05:57.371]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[03:06:00.191 --> 03:06:01.772]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:01.772 --> 03:06:06.934]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:06:06.934 --> 03:06:10.216]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:06:10.216 --> 03:06:16.019]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:06:16.019 --> 03:06:21.722]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:06:22.162 --> 03:06:25.126]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:06:25.126 --> 03:06:30.692]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:06:30.692 --> 03:06:37.720]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:06:37.720 --> 03:06:42.286]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[03:06:42.526 --> 03:06:45.830]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:47.932]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:06:47.932 --> 03:06:53.658]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[03:06:53.658 --> 03:06:56.081]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[03:06:56.081 --> 03:06:57.783]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:07:00.492 --> 03:07:05.974]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:07:05.974 --> 03:07:06.814]  I take this.
[03:07:06.814 --> 03:07:07.954]  My family takes this.
[03:07:07.954 --> 03:07:12.236]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:07:12.236 --> 03:07:16.437]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:07:16.837 --> 03:07:21.480]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:07:21.480 --> 03:07:22.601]  I don't feel good.
[03:07:22.601 --> 03:07:26.364]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:07:26.364 --> 03:07:29.066]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:07:29.066 --> 03:07:34.850]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:07:34.850 --> 03:07:37.812]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:07:37.812 --> 03:07:41.354]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:07:41.354 --> 03:07:43.596]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:07:43.596 --> 03:07:43.956]  I love it.
[03:07:44.096 --> 03:07:46.900]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:07:46.900 --> 03:07:47.921]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:47.921 --> 03:07:53.748]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:53.748 --> 03:07:55.751]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:07:55.751 --> 03:07:56.992]  It's a win-win.
[03:07:56.992 --> 03:07:57.954]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:08:08.644 --> 03:08:11.807]  The answer to terrorism is liberty.
[03:08:11.807 --> 03:08:13.849]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:20.877]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:20.877 --> 03:08:26.723]  I don't know how this is going to end, but they want to fight.
[03:08:26.723 --> 03:08:29.285]  They better believe they've got one.
[03:08:29.285 --> 03:08:30.486]  That's the key to this.
[03:08:31.764 --> 03:08:34.446]  These type of criminals, the more you roll over, the worse it gets.
[03:08:34.446 --> 03:08:35.706]  We're just gonna fight.
[03:08:35.706 --> 03:08:38.308]  Not gonna worry about how this ends or where this is going.
[03:08:38.308 --> 03:08:42.651]  I gotta tell you though, my soul loves it!
[03:08:42.651 --> 03:08:46.453]  It's the opposite of fear.
[03:08:46.453 --> 03:08:49.795]  The globalists want to break the law and bring in tyranny?
[03:08:49.795 --> 03:08:52.596]  We're gonna break them.
[03:08:52.596 --> 03:08:54.197]  Alright, David Knight's coming up in just about 12 minutes.
[03:08:54.197 --> 03:08:57.379]  I got a lot of clips to get to her in a short time to get there.
[03:08:57.379 --> 03:08:58.340]  I should add that
[03:09:00.254 --> 03:09:01.935]  I never knew this would be such a popular product.
[03:09:01.935 --> 03:09:24.168]  I mean, I had an idea it would be made in America, organic, high quality, non-GMO, non-fluoride, with iodine, with the colloidal silver, super blue, InfoWars life, sold out last time, the first shipment in three days, the second shipment was twice as big, 12 days, and the tubes are the issue.
[03:09:25.225 --> 03:09:30.547]  The tubes are the issue, and so we're having trouble getting the tubes up to change the tubes.
[03:09:30.547 --> 03:09:32.348]  So we only got in a limited amount of the tubes.
[03:09:32.348 --> 03:09:34.749]  The new stuff coming out may be in a different tube.
[03:09:34.749 --> 03:09:35.610]  But this is a limited run.
[03:09:36.744 --> 03:09:41.105]  Available at InfoWarsLives.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:09:41.105 --> 03:09:46.446]  I've got it discounted out of the gates as low as, what, like $8 a tube at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:09:46.446 --> 03:09:50.727]  We make like four or five bucks to help fund the operation, so thank you all for your support today.
[03:09:50.727 --> 03:09:54.688]  We're certainly under globalist attack, and your purchases help fund this whole operation.
[03:09:54.688 --> 03:09:55.848]  You're who sponsors this.
[03:09:55.848 --> 03:09:58.709]  Not George Soros, not David Rockefeller, you name it.
[03:09:58.709 --> 03:09:58.949]  Okay.
[03:09:59.963 --> 03:10:04.526]  I don't want to cut this clip off, so here is Nunes, who's been pretty good actually in the House Intelligence Committee.
[03:10:04.526 --> 03:10:11.770]  He said a month ago and two weeks ago and yesterday, we've looked at all the files, there's not even phone calls with Roger Stone and Manafort to Russians.
[03:10:11.770 --> 03:10:18.435]  There is with Flynn, when he's the National Security Advisor incoming, and the transcripts of that are illegal.
[03:10:18.435 --> 03:10:23.538]  They had to unmask him, but the computer programs are keywords, so it's recording it with keywords.
[03:10:23.538 --> 03:10:26.320]  That's what Google is, it's just a database of words that are said.
[03:10:27.481 --> 03:10:32.642]  And then, that's what Google was, was an NSA echelon program that's 30 years old.
[03:10:32.642 --> 03:10:36.824]  They've got more update stuff, but you're supposed to mask, you know, General Michael T. Flynn or whatever.
[03:10:36.824 --> 03:10:37.784]  They don't do that.
[03:10:37.784 --> 03:10:39.885]  They illegally took that off, gave it to the media.
[03:10:39.885 --> 03:10:42.425]  You know, look, he talked to the Russians!
[03:10:42.425 --> 03:10:45.466]  Well, he publicly said he was lining up calls to Trump.
[03:10:45.466 --> 03:10:46.586]  He talked to the Turks, everybody else.
[03:10:46.586 --> 03:10:48.147]  That's what Flynn's working hard for this country.
[03:10:49.138 --> 03:10:51.880]  I mean, Flynn's love of the military is totally kicking ass.
[03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:55.502]  It's like Trump just restored our coal, folks.
[03:10:55.502 --> 03:10:58.783]  Russia and all these other countries don't have big coal exports.
[03:10:58.783 --> 03:10:59.564]  We do.
[03:10:59.564 --> 03:11:01.685]  Or they export natural gas.
[03:11:01.685 --> 03:11:03.246]  That devastates Russia.
[03:11:03.246 --> 03:11:08.008]  We don't want to devastate Russia, but sorry, America's going to have cheap power again.
[03:11:08.008 --> 03:11:12.791]  Everything Trump's doing is absolutely, quite frankly, undercutting other countries.
[03:11:12.791 --> 03:11:17.193]  Now, if they want to do trade deals with us, they can, but that's why the economy's turning back on, folks.
[03:11:18.311 --> 03:11:19.671]  Trump is representing us.
[03:11:19.671 --> 03:11:20.652]  That's how you prove it.
[03:11:20.652 --> 03:11:23.973]  It's like Horton has a who.
[03:11:23.973 --> 03:11:28.854]  You know, the maizey bird doesn't sit with the egg, so when it hatches, it's a baby elephant.
[03:11:28.854 --> 03:11:31.315]  You know, Horton has a who, Dr. Seuss.
[03:11:31.315 --> 03:11:32.235]  I'm not saying that's real.
[03:11:32.235 --> 03:11:33.216]  Many will say I'm being real.
[03:11:33.216 --> 03:11:34.136]  No, it's an allegory.
[03:11:34.136 --> 03:11:35.456]  It's a parallel.
[03:11:35.456 --> 03:11:37.157]  I mean, you know, America's reborn.
[03:11:37.157 --> 03:11:37.697]  It hatches out.
[03:11:37.697 --> 03:11:42.979]  It looks like Donald Trump's got, you know, gold hair and a little... I mean, it's just crazy.
[03:11:42.979 --> 03:11:44.499]  So we're going to get to this clip.
[03:11:44.499 --> 03:11:46.520]  We'll do the Rockefeller dying in a moment, but here briefly.
[03:11:47.950 --> 03:11:54.135]  Here is the clip we didn't finish up with the NSA director being talked to by Nunes.
[03:11:54.135 --> 03:12:03.183]  So my question as of today, Admiral Rogers, do you have any evidence that Russia's cyber actors changed vote tallies in the state of Michigan?
[03:12:04.548 --> 03:12:09.769]  No, I do not, but I would highlight we're a foreign intelligence organization, not a domestic intelligence organization.
[03:12:09.769 --> 03:12:11.490]  Oh yeah, you never watch anything here.
[03:12:11.490 --> 03:12:14.611]  You never watch foreign groups coming into the U.S.
[03:12:14.611 --> 03:12:15.331]  Lie!
[03:12:15.331 --> 03:12:17.752]  How about the state of Pennsylvania?
[03:12:17.752 --> 03:12:18.632]  No, sir.
[03:12:18.632 --> 03:12:19.892]  The state of Wisconsin?
[03:12:19.892 --> 03:12:20.652]  No, sir.
[03:12:20.652 --> 03:12:21.673]  State of Florida?
[03:12:21.673 --> 03:12:22.333]  No, sir.
[03:12:22.333 --> 03:12:23.893]  State of North Carolina?
[03:12:23.893 --> 03:12:24.793]  No, sir.
[03:12:24.793 --> 03:12:25.994]  State of Ohio?
[03:12:25.994 --> 03:12:26.294]  No, sir.
[03:12:27.375 --> 03:12:33.162]  So you have no intelligence that suggests or evidence that suggests any votes were changed?
[03:12:33.162 --> 03:12:36.126]  I have nothing generated by the National Security Agency, sir.
[03:12:36.126 --> 03:12:42.754]  Director Comey, do you have any evidence at the FBI that any votes were changed in the states that I mentioned to Admiral Rogers?
[03:12:42.754 --> 03:12:44.416]  No.
[03:12:44.416 --> 03:12:44.717]  Thank you.
[03:12:46.431 --> 03:12:47.672]  They're showing the news saying that happened.
[03:12:47.672 --> 03:12:50.294]  When Hillary got caught, what do you do when you get caught and you lose?
[03:12:50.294 --> 03:12:51.535]  You go say the other group did it.
[03:12:51.535 --> 03:12:54.258]  Here's another clip where they talk about unmasking the names.
[03:12:54.258 --> 03:12:55.539]  Because that's what Trump said.
[03:12:55.539 --> 03:12:58.101]  You're listening to us and you're giving it to the media?
[03:12:58.101 --> 03:12:58.782]  That's illegal.
[03:12:58.782 --> 03:13:00.343]  What on earth are you doing?
[03:13:00.343 --> 03:13:01.364]  You give it to the Justice Department.
[03:13:02.503 --> 03:13:04.104]  Or the Senate Armed Services Committee.
[03:13:04.104 --> 03:13:05.324]  Or the House Armed Services Committee.
[03:13:05.324 --> 03:13:06.544]  Or the Intelligence Committee.
[03:13:06.544 --> 03:13:10.026]  You don't give it to the media.
[03:13:10.026 --> 03:13:11.666]  And they went, oh yeah, we got the recordings.
[03:13:11.666 --> 03:13:12.687]  Oh actually, we never did that.
[03:13:12.687 --> 03:13:14.067]  You're crazy, we never said that.
[03:13:14.067 --> 03:13:15.728]  Hoping you don't remember a month and a half ago.
[03:13:15.728 --> 03:13:18.829]  Again, I keep harping on that.
[03:13:18.829 --> 03:13:23.431]  Is that it's just crazy that they do that.
[03:13:23.431 --> 03:13:24.531]  Now, let's shift gears.
[03:13:24.531 --> 03:13:26.212]  David Rockefeller died yesterday at 101.
[03:13:26.212 --> 03:13:29.573]  And he had always said that no one in his family lived past 100.
[03:13:31.101 --> 03:13:32.002]  So he broke the family record.
[03:13:32.002 --> 03:13:36.908]  Well, like, John Dee I died at 99 and all, like, two days before or whatever.
[03:13:36.908 --> 03:13:41.753]  I mean, that's in the family lore of this very parasitic, clearly genetic, psychopathic family.
[03:13:41.753 --> 03:13:45.578]  A lot of people can pass on psychopathic, or at least sociopathic traits.
[03:13:45.578 --> 03:13:46.999]  That's been proven.
[03:13:46.999 --> 03:13:48.922]  Globo said Rockefeller dead at 101.
[03:13:48.922 --> 03:13:50.463]  The whole world government project with the British
[03:13:51.064 --> 03:13:56.326]  The whole New World Order, the land, the Rockefeller Plaza, let the UN be built on.
[03:13:56.326 --> 03:13:59.448]  Of the 100 plus globalist organizations, they founded almost all of them.
[03:13:59.448 --> 03:14:02.489]  Bilderberg founded it in 1954 in Oosterbeek, Holland.
[03:14:02.489 --> 03:14:08.391]  I mean, it's just figurative as Trump's in and all this is happening, that this guy died.
[03:14:08.391 --> 03:14:16.795]  A few years ago, in 2012, we did a mock funeral for, not wishing him to die, because his evil obviously lives on his institutions, like the ring of Mordor.
[03:14:17.779 --> 03:14:26.584]  But just a mock funeral joke for the YouTube clip on Infowars.com, the mock deathbed confession of David Rockefeller.
[03:14:26.584 --> 03:14:32.328]  And it's a scene from the Dark Crystal with the Skeksis when the Emperor's about to die and they're about to pass the power on.
[03:14:32.328 --> 03:14:35.230]  But you can believe that already happened a few years ago.
[03:14:35.230 --> 03:14:39.132]  And his nephew, Senator Rockefeller, didn't want the power.
[03:14:39.132 --> 03:14:40.673]  He's kind of scared off.
[03:14:40.673 --> 03:14:41.554]  It's a high workload.
[03:14:41.554 --> 03:14:46.757]  And I'm telling you, it's now Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,
[03:14:49.011 --> 03:14:53.393]  And people like, of course, our good friend George Soros.
[03:14:53.393 --> 03:14:54.273]  They're the front guys.
[03:14:54.273 --> 03:14:58.755]  There's a lot of old money behind them, but they're field marshals in the fight against humanity.
[03:14:58.755 --> 03:15:07.739]  And a guy whose father funded Adolf Hitler, who was in Germany helping put Hitler in power as a young man, in college in Germany, IBM, whole deal.
[03:15:07.739 --> 03:15:18.203]  You want to know who runs your life with fluoride in your water, cancer viruses in your vaccines, and brags about it in his memoirs, how he wants world government, wants to reduce your population, make you poor?
[03:15:18.203 --> 03:15:18.563]  That's him.
[03:15:21.735 --> 03:15:24.976]  Probably too old for the brain transplant.
[03:15:24.976 --> 03:15:26.337]  Is he really dead, you think?
[03:15:26.337 --> 03:15:30.439]  Who knows with these people, but they got advanced technologies, but probably not that advanced, right?
[03:15:30.439 --> 03:15:32.180]  I mean, we know they're going for him.
[03:15:32.180 --> 03:15:37.082]  So, for a little fun, it's more powerful if you're a TV viewer, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:15:37.962 --> 03:15:45.067]  Here is the deathbed event and deathbed footage of David Rockefeller dying yesterday.
[03:15:45.067 --> 03:15:52.873]  David Rockefeller, a globalist, central banker, advocate of New World Order and mass population control while wielding a vast influence over world leaders, died Monday at the age of 101.
[03:15:52.873 --> 03:15:57.316]  Family spokesman Frieser P. Seddle confirmed his passing.
[03:15:57.316 --> 03:16:03.360]  Rockefeller, who was well-known for openly bragging about transnational elite's plans to centralize control of the world's populations, wealth, and resources.
[03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:04.601]  And so it goes on from there.
[03:16:05.121 --> 03:16:14.909]  So here, under satire, not real news, I'll probably claim I'm being serious here, is him making the jump into hyperspace.
[03:16:14.909 --> 03:16:16.790]  We don't know what destination.
[03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:21.434]  Here it is.
[03:16:21.434 --> 03:16:23.716]  Creeping along at the Rockefeller command base.
[03:16:23.716 --> 03:16:30.401]  Oprah Winfrey does attend secret meetings with him, ABC News, to discuss world government and forced population reduction.
[03:16:30.401 --> 03:16:32.643]  So we've got, we've got,
[03:16:33.926 --> 03:16:39.390]  Brzezinski and George Soros walking up the hall, facing each other off about who gets the second.
[03:16:39.390 --> 03:16:51.980]  Quiet!
[03:16:51.980 --> 03:16:53.542]  Quiet!
[03:16:53.542 --> 03:17:01.448]  The elites are exactly like this, a bunch of arrogant scum.
[03:17:01.448 --> 03:17:02.789]  Madeline Albright actually looks like a skeksi.
[03:17:06.807 --> 03:17:09.788]  Neo, bow!
[03:17:09.788 --> 03:17:10.628]  They get around the throne.
[03:17:10.628 --> 03:17:17.569]  He's not dead yet.
[03:17:17.569 --> 03:17:19.749]  Not dead yet.
[03:17:19.749 --> 03:17:21.730]  There's the beautiful David Rockefeller.
[03:17:21.730 --> 03:17:31.352]  It's more like Hillary, kind of.
[03:17:31.352 --> 03:17:32.292]  He reaches for the scepter.
[03:17:34.396 --> 03:17:36.597]  Mine.
[03:17:36.597 --> 03:17:37.377]  My country.
[03:17:37.377 --> 03:17:39.038]  I'll rob you, blind America.
[03:17:39.038 --> 03:17:43.780]  I'll teach you Christians, bitter clingers.
[03:17:43.780 --> 03:17:44.480]  I'm not the threat.
[03:17:44.480 --> 03:17:57.325]  Trump is.
[03:17:57.325 --> 03:18:00.286]  David Rockefeller, 101.
[03:18:00.286 --> 03:18:03.047]  Total global government collapsing before his eyes.
[03:18:07.751 --> 03:18:10.512]  I didn't want to live to see Dev Rockefeller six feet under.
[03:18:10.512 --> 03:18:11.792]  Not in a mean way.
[03:18:11.792 --> 03:18:12.612]  In a loving way.
[03:18:12.612 --> 03:18:15.353]  Look at all the vaccines.
[03:18:15.353 --> 03:18:16.273]  And here's all his work.
[03:18:16.273 --> 03:18:19.674]  His whole world government falls to dust.
[03:18:19.674 --> 03:18:24.975]  Like sandcastles at the beach.
[03:18:24.975 --> 03:18:29.856]  Yes, castles will crumble eventually into the sea.
[03:18:34.520 --> 03:18:35.681]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:35.681 --> 03:18:38.062]  That is the death of David Rockefeller.
[03:18:38.062 --> 03:18:40.464]  Televised live at Infowars.com.
[03:18:40.464 --> 03:18:43.185]  Transmitted worldwide.
[03:18:43.185 --> 03:18:47.768]  He wrote in the New York Times when Mao Zedong died that he did a great job in China and he hoped for that here in America.
[03:18:47.768 --> 03:18:50.630]  So he's a guy that supported somebody that killed 80 plus million Chinese.
[03:18:50.630 --> 03:18:52.071]  So I think I can make fun of him dying.
[03:18:52.071 --> 03:18:53.792]  What do you think?
[03:18:53.792 --> 03:18:53.952]  Right?
[03:18:55.362 --> 03:18:59.507]  I'm sure there'll be some articles about that, but nothing about the admissions.
[03:18:59.507 --> 03:19:11.220]  And I hope that when John McAfee comes on here in a minute with David Knight, literally in about 60 seconds, I hope that we'll bring up to him the story on InfoWars.com and DrudgeReport.com that almost 24 hours into
[03:19:13.314 --> 03:19:14.294]  No one has covered.
[03:19:14.294 --> 03:19:15.515]  Yeah, there's a quote.
[03:19:15.515 --> 03:19:24.559]  Whatever the price of the Chinese revolution, it has obviously succeeded not only in producing a more efficient and dedicated administration, but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose.
[03:19:24.559 --> 03:19:26.100]  Yeah, we'll kill your ass if you don't.
[03:19:26.100 --> 03:19:31.542]  The social experiment shot under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.
[03:19:31.542 --> 03:19:33.703]  That was after I was in the New York Times.
[03:19:33.703 --> 03:19:34.743]  I went and got off the microfilm.
[03:19:34.743 --> 03:19:35.704]  It's in my film Endgame.
[03:19:35.704 --> 03:19:40.366]  I was at the UT library showing it on the microfiche.
[03:19:40.366 --> 03:19:42.547]  Because folks used to deny that quote was real.
[03:19:44.073 --> 03:19:54.617]  Uh, they admitted the giant Great Leap Forward, Coastal Revolution, one of the biggest disasters in human history, killed 84 million Chinese, but not according to David Rockefeller.
[03:19:54.617 --> 03:20:01.720]  So, old David has made the jump into, uh, hyperspace, and I see that we have John McAfee over there right now with David.
[03:20:01.720 --> 03:20:03.281]  Now, are they ready for me to go to them, or are they still, uh...
[03:20:04.952 --> 03:20:08.213]  So, I can't describe to the listeners how big it is and how important it is.
[03:20:08.213 --> 03:20:09.214]  I know you know the NSA was spying on Trump.
[03:20:09.214 --> 03:20:11.615]  I know you saw them in the newspapers saying they were spying on Trump.
[03:20:11.615 --> 03:20:12.495]  You saw that.
[03:20:12.495 --> 03:20:14.456]  And then now they said they weren't spying on Trump.
[03:20:37.808 --> 03:20:41.069]  Now we need to get the article out where we have NSA documents which are clearly real.
[03:20:41.069 --> 03:20:43.730]  It's got phone numbers I never put out.
[03:20:43.730 --> 03:20:44.730]  All sorts of stuff.
[03:20:44.730 --> 03:20:46.571]  Trump's phone numbers that I've got.
[03:20:46.571 --> 03:20:47.871]  It's him.
[03:20:47.871 --> 03:20:49.852]  This came out in federal cases.
[03:20:49.852 --> 03:20:52.012]  Basically CIA contractor.
[03:20:52.012 --> 03:20:52.952]  And all this is going on.
[03:20:52.952 --> 03:20:53.873]  It's a new Snowden.
[03:20:53.873 --> 03:21:00.055]  The headline is New Snowden exposes massive Obama NSA spying on Trump.
[03:21:00.055 --> 03:21:01.935]  Also on Sheriff Arpaio and his court case.
[03:21:01.935 --> 03:21:04.176]  So it's at Infowars.com.
[03:21:06.075 --> 03:21:09.700]  And most importantly, they're trying to block us on Facebook, Google, Twitter, everywhere.
[03:21:09.700 --> 03:21:13.946]  More than ever, you've got to send links via email, you've got to contact friends and family, neighbors.
[03:21:13.946 --> 03:21:23.559]  They don't want you visiting InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, DrugsReport.com, and they're openly trying to wrangle and set up a whole system where this happens.
[03:21:25.663 --> 03:21:30.665]  All right, I'm going to go ahead and hand the baton over to David Knight to host the rest of the transmission.
[03:21:30.665 --> 03:21:33.766]  I want to thank all the viewers for their support.
[03:21:33.766 --> 03:21:38.967]  And he's got, of course, McAfee of hacking fame to break all this down straight ahead.
[03:21:38.967 --> 03:21:41.208]  And then the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:21:41.208 --> 03:21:50.331]  But just the sleeping giant that was awake under Trump's run is somewhat awake now, but needs to get really awake because all hands on deck, this is the fight.
[03:21:50.331 --> 03:21:51.331]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:21:51.331 --> 03:21:52.692]  Now for the rest of transmission with David Knight.
[03:21:53.851 --> 03:21:54.512]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:21:54.512 --> 03:22:02.400]  And you know, we have this situation where we've got the most successful person who is iconic in terms of anti-hacking, John McAfee.
[03:22:02.400 --> 03:22:06.283]  Everybody that's got a computer has got his anti-virus software.
[03:22:06.283 --> 03:22:12.450]  I thought it'd be great to have him comment on Vault 7 in general, but of course, today we've had the Dog and Pony Show.
[03:22:12.990 --> 03:22:14.611]  Of FBI Director Comey.
[03:22:14.611 --> 03:22:31.997]  So I think it's interesting to contrast the cold water that FBI Director Comey is pouring on the idea that anybody would be wiretapping a person of interest like Donald Trump, at the same time saying, oh, we really are doing an investigation of this red herring story that the Russians hacked our election.
[03:22:31.997 --> 03:22:33.698]  And then we had units go through there.
[03:22:33.698 --> 03:22:34.998]  Well, did they get into this?
[03:22:34.998 --> 03:22:37.079]  Did they get into that state, that state, that state?
[03:22:37.079 --> 03:22:37.619]  Of course they didn't.
[03:22:37.639 --> 03:22:42.300]  But we do know that the Department of Homeland Security hacked into State Board of Elections.
[03:22:42.300 --> 03:22:47.281]  Imagine if it came out that Russia had done what our own Homeland Security did.
[03:22:47.281 --> 03:22:50.501]  But we have to pretend that our government is not listening to us.
[03:22:50.501 --> 03:22:55.282]  In spite of the documentary evidence, we have to pretend that they have no interest in hacking the election.
[03:22:55.282 --> 03:23:02.864]  So I want to go to John McAfee, get his take, and have him try to educate the public somewhat more on Vault 7.
[03:23:02.864 --> 03:23:04.424]  Thank you for joining us, John McAfee.
[03:23:07.068 --> 03:23:08.189]  It's good to be on.
[03:23:08.189 --> 03:23:09.630]  Thank you, John.
[03:23:09.630 --> 03:23:24.500]  Let's start by saying the inability, it's absolutely, by the way, impossible to determine the source of a hack if the hacker is even remotely sophisticated.
[03:23:24.500 --> 03:23:27.042]  Because look at the hackers we do catch.
[03:23:27.042 --> 03:23:35.648]  They're teenage boys, like the 15-year-old who hacked into the FBI, stole every name, address, phone number, photograph,
[03:23:36.477 --> 03:23:46.445]  Fingerprints and social security number of every undercover agent in the FBI and published it on the dark web.
[03:23:46.445 --> 03:23:48.667]  Now, what was the FBI's response?
[03:23:48.667 --> 03:23:54.832]  Instead of going, oh my god, we're incompetent, they go, hey, we caught the kid.
[03:23:54.832 --> 03:23:57.434]  Of course you caught him, he's 15.
[03:23:57.434 --> 03:24:03.079]  Please, try to catch a 35 year old, seriously dedicated hacker.
[03:24:03.079 --> 03:24:05.881]  Try to catch an entire hacking organization.
[03:24:06.706 --> 03:24:10.840]  Like the mafia of hackers in Russia that are doing all the ransomware.
[03:24:11.616 --> 03:24:15.798]  No, you're not going to do that because anybody can hide their tracks.
[03:24:15.798 --> 03:24:17.859]  Absolutely, we've had this discussion before with you.
[03:24:17.859 --> 03:24:21.221]  You've been on before when this began months ago.
[03:24:21.221 --> 03:24:26.744]  We had you on and you were talking about the fact that they could very easily cover their tracks.
[03:24:26.744 --> 03:24:33.047]  They said, well, we've got some indication that indicates that it might be done by a Russian language individual.
[03:24:33.047 --> 03:24:39.190]  But of course, as we talked about months ago, you and I, anybody worth their salt would either
[03:24:39.750 --> 03:24:44.111]  First of all, not leave those fingerprints, or they put false fingerprints to incriminate somebody else.
[03:24:44.111 --> 03:24:50.472]  But now we've had Vault 7 showing the documents of how they do it, in addition to your expertise.
[03:24:50.472 --> 03:24:52.353]  They said, this is how we do it.
[03:24:52.353 --> 03:24:55.113]  And we changed the compiler times.
[03:24:55.113 --> 03:25:03.455]  We put, if we wanted to make it look like the Russians, we use a Cyrillic keyboard, the Russian language, Russian hacking techniques.
[03:25:03.455 --> 03:25:08.596]  We'll find an old Russian state program, which is in the public domain, and we'll use that.
[03:25:09.236 --> 03:25:10.217]  Please!
[03:25:10.217 --> 03:25:12.740]  So, I've been saying this for years.
[03:25:12.740 --> 03:25:16.344]  You simply can't find the source of an attack.
[03:25:16.344 --> 03:25:18.807]  And the CIA said the same thing.
[03:25:18.807 --> 03:25:23.673]  So, yet, our FBI is going, yes, the Russians hacked Yahoo.
[03:25:23.673 --> 03:25:24.954]  Yes, they hacked the DNC.
[03:25:26.209 --> 03:25:27.829]  Well, I don't know about Yahoo.
[03:25:27.829 --> 03:25:32.710]  I find it extraordinarily unlikely, but I do know about the DNC.
[03:25:32.710 --> 03:25:42.152]  It could not have been the Russians, because they used a program that was one and a half years old, and had not bothered to keep it updated.
[03:25:42.152 --> 03:25:50.374]  Please, if you're a Russian state hacker, and you did that, they would schedule you for suicide the next morning.
[03:25:50.374 --> 03:25:52.174]  You know they don't do such stupid things.
[03:25:53.104 --> 03:25:55.927]  Absolutely, and that is a very important point.
[03:25:55.927 --> 03:26:02.834]  The fact that the software that was actually used was an out-of-date version of something that was essentially in the public domain.
[03:26:02.834 --> 03:26:08.519]  But I want you to comment, John, on Vault 7, because now we have thousands of
[03:26:09.660 --> 03:26:29.148]  Pieces of hacking software that were commissioned by the CIA and of course we had Aaron Schwartz tell us years ago when he was talking about SOPA, ACTA, PIPA, CISPA, all those different things trying to fight that new level of government surveillance where they would then give immunity to the corporations who collect all this information on us.
[03:26:29.148 --> 03:26:34.951]  He said at the time that it was the US government that was funding and creating these exploits.
[03:26:35.091 --> 03:26:38.114]  And now we see that with Vault 7, but they pretend that doesn't happen.
[03:26:38.114 --> 03:26:47.483]  As this was coming out, we had Stephen Colbert mocking the very idea that they would use the Internet of Things to spy on you through appliances.
[03:26:47.483 --> 03:26:48.564]  Remember that?
[03:26:48.564 --> 03:26:51.207]  We had that admission five years to the day earlier.
[03:26:51.727 --> 03:27:04.199]  David Petraeus is saying we're going to use all your appliances to listen to you and yet when Kellyanne Conway points that out it's like you do know of course that they are listening to us through our televisions, our phones, and all of our appliances.
[03:27:04.199 --> 03:27:10.485]  They are rolling on the floor laughing with Stephen Colbert and The Late Show as if that didn't exist.
[03:27:10.485 --> 03:27:11.185]  I mean is this a
[03:27:12.206 --> 03:27:15.727]  Is this an intelligence operation in the comedy sense, or what?
[03:27:15.727 --> 03:27:23.330]  I mean, this is absolutely unbelievable that they would think the American public is so stupid, has such a short attention span.
[03:27:23.330 --> 03:27:26.791]  Well, unfortunately, some of us are.
[03:27:26.791 --> 03:27:36.435]  Because what happens is 90% of the people get their facts, their truth, from the mainstream media, which has become a reality show.
[03:27:37.526 --> 03:27:52.709]  And so any politically motivated happening which is titillating or exciting or makes us angry, like we're all going to be angry at the Russians, well, the mainstream media is going to make of it what they want.
[03:27:53.789 --> 03:27:58.774]  But the CIA admitted, here's the horror of Vault 17.
[03:27:58.774 --> 03:28:11.946]  The horror is they kept these exploits from the very industries that they had used to exploit, including Microsoft, Google, Apple, all of our software industries.
[03:28:11.946 --> 03:28:18.452]  And even if they didn't create them, when they discovered that other hackers had created them, do you know what they did?
[03:28:19.736 --> 03:28:20.417]  Not a thing!
[03:28:20.417 --> 03:28:21.458]  That's right.
[03:28:21.458 --> 03:28:21.799]  That's right.
[03:28:21.799 --> 03:28:28.688]  Do you realize that costs Americans billions of dollars and put us at risk?
[03:28:28.688 --> 03:28:30.130]  At serious risk.
[03:28:30.130 --> 03:28:31.271]  It's unconscionable.
[03:28:31.271 --> 03:28:36.378]  It's like keeping a boatload of penicillin out of the hands of sick people.
[03:28:37.003 --> 03:28:40.627]  Because you're afraid that the enemy may get their hands on it.
[03:28:56.866 --> 03:28:59.127]  They do not let anyone know.
[03:28:59.127 --> 03:29:00.487]  They continue to leave this out there.
[03:29:00.487 --> 03:29:06.009]  And I think it's very interesting, John, the fact that there's not going to be, these things can't be copyrighted.
[03:29:06.009 --> 03:29:09.070]  They didn't want to copyright them because they didn't want to let people know that they existed.
[03:29:09.070 --> 03:29:13.371]  But they also didn't classify them because if they classify these exploits,
[03:29:14.031 --> 03:29:25.174]  Then when the CIA spread them around, putting them on people's computers, they would be liable for charges of violating national security by putting national security information out there.
[03:29:25.174 --> 03:29:26.014]  We've got to take a break.
[03:29:26.014 --> 03:29:32.776]  We're going to come right back with John McAfee, the guy who made a fortune producing anti-hacking software.
[03:29:32.776 --> 03:29:36.597]  What does he think about Vault 7 and what the CIA has done?
[03:29:36.597 --> 03:29:37.897]  We'll be right back with John McAfee.
[03:29:48.880 --> 03:29:52.803]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.803 --> 03:29:55.485]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.693 --> 03:30:07.357]  The House Intelligence Committee hearing today on Russia and the 2016 elections has been quite the fake news, anti-Trump, double standard ceremony.
[03:30:07.357 --> 03:30:12.981]  Led by the anti-Trump team of Schiff, Comey, and Nunes, the 2020 Globalist Democrat campaign for U.S.
[03:30:12.981 --> 03:30:14.221]  President has begun.
[03:30:14.221 --> 03:30:19.324]  Admiral Rogers of the NSA could not answer many questions due to national security and classified information.
[03:30:19.324 --> 03:30:22.706]  The hearing was loaded with canned questions, responses, and lawyer talk.
[03:30:22.706 --> 03:30:27.269]  The Trump-Russia narrative echoed with, there was no wiretapping, attacks peppered in.
[03:30:27.529 --> 03:30:28.551]  So now, U.S.
[03:30:28.551 --> 03:30:38.285]  officials are discussing the investigation of Russian influence on the Trump campaign and the election, but at the same time, attacking Trump for claiming he was being investigated by the U.S.
[03:30:38.285 --> 03:30:39.927]  government during these investigations.
[03:30:39.927 --> 03:30:41.229]  1984 doublethink in the flesh.
[03:30:43.152 --> 03:30:44.194]  Understand this.
[03:30:44.194 --> 03:30:48.720]  This hearing and all other related hearings or narratives are nothing more than the globalist Democrat U.S.
[03:30:48.720 --> 03:30:49.921]  presidential campaign for 2020.
[03:30:49.921 --> 03:30:56.710]  They will try to delegitimize President Trump with fake news, then attack him on it the entire 2020 campaign.
[03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:58.953]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:30:59.534 --> 03:31:00.354]  Hey, everyone!
[03:31:00.354 --> 03:31:06.477]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:31:06.477 --> 03:31:08.558]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:31:08.558 --> 03:31:18.822]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:31:18.822 --> 03:31:24.805]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:31:25.285 --> 03:31:40.122]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:31:40.162 --> 03:31:40.642]  I think so.
[03:31:59.423 --> 03:32:03.604]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[03:32:03.604 --> 03:32:06.364]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[03:32:06.364 --> 03:32:07.885]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[03:32:07.885 --> 03:32:12.125]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[03:32:12.125 --> 03:32:15.926]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[03:32:15.926 --> 03:32:17.566]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[03:32:17.566 --> 03:32:19.167]  They're gonna be coming after you good.
[03:32:19.167 --> 03:32:19.587]  Oh, yeah.
[03:32:19.587 --> 03:32:21.707]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[03:32:21.707 --> 03:32:22.327]  At all.
[03:32:22.327 --> 03:32:23.387]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[03:32:23.387 --> 03:32:25.788]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:32:25.788 --> 03:32:26.488]  They lost.
[03:32:26.988 --> 03:32:27.749]  We won.
[03:32:27.749 --> 03:32:29.950]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[03:32:29.950 --> 03:32:31.291]  It's time to ride, boss.
[03:32:31.291 --> 03:32:32.972]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[03:32:32.972 --> 03:32:39.276]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[03:32:39.276 --> 03:32:41.618]  And beef was for supper.
[03:32:41.618 --> 03:32:42.418]  Revelation.
[03:32:42.418 --> 03:32:44.100]  Dawn of global government.

[03:32:57.948 --> 03:32:58.808]  Let's fix it.
[03:32:58.808 --> 03:33:02.470]  Another world.
[03:33:02.470 --> 03:33:03.290]  Another time.
[03:33:03.290 --> 03:33:04.351]  In the age of wonder.
[03:33:25.673 --> 03:33:32.398]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:32.398 --> 03:33:38.442]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:41.883 --> 03:33:51.973]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and we're going to be talking to John McAfee, the man who made a fortune protecting us from hackers, but who protects us from the CIA?
[03:33:51.973 --> 03:33:54.355]  The people who have funded all these exploits.
[03:33:54.355 --> 03:33:56.677]  Remember, and of course this is according to WikiLeaks and Vault 7,
[03:33:57.638 --> 03:34:22.207]  They say that by the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division had over 5,000 registered users, had produced more than 1,000 hacking systems, trojans, viruses, other weaponized malware, techniques allowed the CIA to bypass encryption of, and listen to these apps in case you use some of them, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo, Confide, Cloakman,
[03:34:22.867 --> 03:34:29.389]  What they would do is hack your smartphone and grab this information even before it was encrypted.
[03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:31.070]  Then they let all this stuff go.
[03:34:31.070 --> 03:34:36.932]  It's out in the public domain and they don't warn anybody about this because they want to keep this secret.
[03:34:36.932 --> 03:34:44.974]  So when you talk about white hat hackers and you talk about black hat hackers, you can say that the CIA is definitely on the black hat side.
[03:34:44.974 --> 03:34:48.996]  Even though they knew this stuff was gone, they didn't warn anybody.
[03:34:48.996 --> 03:34:49.696]  So now we've got
[03:34:50.336 --> 03:34:58.582]  WikiLeaks, working with these different companies, telling them what these exploits are, giving them the information that the CIA would not do.
[03:34:58.582 --> 03:35:09.651]  When you are told that you need to sacrifice your liberty, and they promise they're going to make you more secure, they're going to make you more safe, I hope you remember what the CIA has done with this.
[03:35:10.271 --> 03:35:21.881]  Not only did they fund these exploits, and remember, going back to what Aaron Schwartz said, he said years ago, before he died, before I believe they killed him, he said the government is funding the creation of vulnerabilities.
[03:35:21.881 --> 03:35:27.745]  They're offering rewards for people to find and build vulnerabilities into the system and give it to the U.S.
[03:35:27.745 --> 03:35:28.106]  government.
[03:35:28.106 --> 03:35:29.447]  And then of course when that leaks out,
[03:35:30.083 --> 03:35:30.323]  U.S.
[03:35:30.323 --> 03:35:32.746]  government doesn't care about your security.
[03:35:32.746 --> 03:35:44.359]  Think of all the mischief that a criminal, just an individual criminal, could do with your accounts using these hacks that the CIA created, funded,
[03:35:45.240 --> 03:35:48.643]  Archived and then lost and told no one about it.
[03:35:48.643 --> 03:35:51.566]  So that's the way they keep you safe, folks.
[03:35:51.566 --> 03:35:52.927]  That's the way they keep you safe.
[03:35:52.927 --> 03:35:57.752]  When you give up your liberty, when you give up your security, when you let them do dragnet surveillance.
[03:35:57.752 --> 03:36:04.257]  And of course, all of the hearing that we heard today, talking about how this was totally laughable.
[03:36:04.898 --> 03:36:07.339]  That anybody would wiretap Donald Trump.
[03:36:07.339 --> 03:36:09.139]  And of course, no president would do this.
[03:36:09.139 --> 03:36:13.260]  Let me just read you a couple of quotes that came out today from FBI Director Comey.
[03:36:13.260 --> 03:36:15.621]  I want to get John McAfee's comments on this.
[03:36:15.621 --> 03:36:20.842]  Comey said, there is no information to support Trump's tweets that he was wiretapped.
[03:36:20.842 --> 03:36:24.183]  Comey said, no president could order such surveillance.
[03:36:24.183 --> 03:36:28.744]  Well, what he left out of there was, no president could legally order such surveillance.
[03:36:28.744 --> 03:36:32.064]  But of course, we have a government now that doesn't care about legality.
[03:36:32.064 --> 03:36:34.085]  Then he said, they're investigating Trump.
[03:36:34.685 --> 03:36:42.248]  And the Russian collusion, but they're not investigating the US intelligence and their collusion with those who want to oppose Donald Trump.
[03:36:42.248 --> 03:36:45.210]  Finally, he said that the Russians were successful.
[03:36:45.210 --> 03:36:48.891]  He actually said the Russians were successful in manipulating our elections.
[03:36:48.891 --> 03:36:54.474]  He said they introduced chaos and discord into our elections, and they will be back in 2018, 2020.
[03:36:54.474 --> 03:36:55.214]  John McAfee, do you really think
[03:36:59.056 --> 03:37:01.957]  That the American people were pwned by the Russians.
[03:37:01.957 --> 03:37:03.937]  Do you think that they hacked our elections?
[03:37:03.937 --> 03:37:09.239]  Of course they use that word hacking to imply that they got in and electronically flipped votes.
[03:37:09.239 --> 03:37:19.562]  And that's one of the reasons why Congressman Nunes went through the list of states with both the FBI director and with Admiral Rogers saying, did they get into the elections in this state, in this state, in this state?
[03:37:19.562 --> 03:37:28.324]  Of course they didn't, but they imply that's what they did because they want to interject the government's homeland security into our electronic voting machines, don't they?
[03:37:30.407 --> 03:37:47.992]  Well, the first comment, you started off by saying that in Vault 7, the CIA said that they had techniques of bypassing WhatsApp, Signal, and every other encrypted program.
[03:37:47.992 --> 03:37:49.332]  Yes, they do.
[03:37:49.332 --> 03:37:53.693]  And they do it using a technique called keystroke logging.
[03:37:53.693 --> 03:37:57.354]  It's the oldest and simplest hacking technique in the world.
[03:37:58.237 --> 03:38:01.561]  I'm going to say something that might frighten a few of you.
[03:38:01.561 --> 03:38:15.218]  If anybody watching this program has ever gone to a pornography site and actually looked at a video, you have a keystroke logger on your phone.
[03:38:16.795 --> 03:38:27.619]  The porn sites sell all of this information to Russian, Chinese and Ukrainian and other hackers around the world so that they can sell you stuff.
[03:38:27.619 --> 03:38:29.100]  The porn site is free.
[03:38:29.100 --> 03:38:30.480]  Nothing is free in life.
[03:38:30.480 --> 03:38:40.824]  Anyway, if you visit a single one, whether it's X Hamster Pornhub or anywhere else, you have a keystroke logger and people have been watching everything that you've typed.
[03:38:41.790 --> 03:38:44.453]  Since you visited that porn site.
[03:38:44.453 --> 03:38:45.233]  And you can't get rid of it.
[03:38:45.233 --> 03:38:49.077]  You're going to have to do a factory reset of your phone.
[03:38:49.077 --> 03:38:50.398]  And it's not just porn sites.
[03:38:50.398 --> 03:39:00.367]  It's any of these websites that offer you something which is spectacular, but it's free, or almost free, or way cheaper than it should be.
[03:39:00.367 --> 03:39:04.130]  Well, don't go visit that site, because there's something wrong with that.
[03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:04.971]  I'm sorry.
[03:39:04.971 --> 03:39:06.793]  The world does not work that way.
[03:39:07.552 --> 03:39:10.395]  So I'm sorry to digress.
[03:39:10.395 --> 03:39:12.677]  But it's also one of the reasons why you get so much spam.
[03:39:12.677 --> 03:39:21.744]  You could just go to a site where they're trying to sell you soap and then all of a sudden you start getting spam about not only soap but about everything in the world because they've collected your information and turned it over.
[03:39:21.744 --> 03:39:34.996]  And of course, John, what the federal government has done is all this information is being collected out there surreptitiously or, you know, with so-called free sites or if you're doing business with these people and they have a legitimate means for
[03:39:35.496 --> 03:39:38.437]  Collecting your information so they can sell you more soap or whatever.
[03:39:38.437 --> 03:39:45.220]  They have now taken away your ability to come after these companies that turn over your information to the government.
[03:39:45.220 --> 03:39:47.901]  They've taken away your ability to sue them with CISA.
[03:39:47.901 --> 03:39:53.303]  And that's the key thing there that the government can now pull that in and start getting information about you.
[03:39:53.303 --> 03:39:59.706]  And even if you haven't gone to something that you don't care about, like a porn site, by getting all this information, all this metadata,
[03:40:00.226 --> 03:40:12.116]  They're able to do activity-based intelligence, human domain analytics to see if the phony narratives that they're selling people, for instance, the Russians hacked our elections, is that really working with the American public?
[03:40:12.116 --> 03:40:23.126]  Let's look at what they're talking about, let's look at where they're going, let's look at what they're putting on social media, and then we can determine whether or not our fake narrative is really gaining traction with the American public.
[03:40:23.126 --> 03:40:24.527]  That is a very dangerous thing.
[03:40:25.859 --> 03:40:26.879]  Absolutely.
[03:40:26.879 --> 03:40:46.744]  But to finish answering your question, Dean, you asked specifically about the CIA's capabilities of hacking and getting access to us, American citizens, and you also mentioned James Comey, the director of the FBI.
[03:40:47.611 --> 03:41:02.466]  Well, if you remember when San Bernardino happened, the shooting, the FBI went to Apple and demanded that Apple give them a master key to all iPhones, meaning that they could unlock anybody.
[03:41:02.466 --> 03:41:03.687]  They didn't need a master key.
[03:41:03.687 --> 03:41:04.248]  I knew they didn't.
[03:41:04.841 --> 03:41:17.776]  Anyway, so I went on CNN and I debated the FBI's mouthpiece of Steve Rogers, and by the way, one of the slickest men I have ever met.
[03:41:17.776 --> 03:41:23.823]  I watched a lot of his interviews with CNN, Fox, and others before I debated him.
[03:41:25.780 --> 03:41:30.962]  And his entire thing was about, you have to give up some privacy.
[03:41:30.962 --> 03:41:31.502]  Yes.
[03:41:31.502 --> 03:41:33.423]  So that we can secure you.
[03:41:33.423 --> 03:41:35.163]  Give up your freedom, give up your privacy.
[03:41:35.163 --> 03:41:39.185]  I'm not going to go down that road with him.
[03:41:39.185 --> 03:41:41.045]  He was too slick.
[03:41:41.045 --> 03:41:44.106]  So I came at it from the other angle.
[03:41:44.106 --> 03:41:50.829]  My problem is not privacy versus security, which in fact it is, but for this case, no.
[03:41:50.829 --> 03:41:51.569]  My problem is,
[03:41:52.256 --> 03:41:55.079]  We have a certain degree of security now.
[03:41:55.079 --> 03:42:01.784]  You are asking America to allow you to make us completely insecure.
[03:42:01.784 --> 03:42:04.467]  Because once you get that key, you can't keep it.
[03:42:05.518 --> 03:42:07.440]  It's an electronic key.
[03:42:07.440 --> 03:42:09.242]  It's bits and bytes.
[03:42:09.242 --> 03:42:13.666]  You cannot keep this from hackers, and the whole world will know.
[03:42:13.666 --> 03:42:15.728]  And that's what we've seen of all seven.
[03:42:15.728 --> 03:42:20.312]  And he finally said, maybe, Mr. McAfee, we can work together.
[03:42:20.312 --> 03:42:22.975]  Fat chance the FBI will ever call me for help.
[03:42:24.966 --> 03:42:34.738]  Well he may be working with the Washington Post, because we have to remember, when we go back to Watergate, and that's one of the things, when Donald Trump tweeted out about wiretaps, he said, this is like Nixon and Watergate.
[03:42:34.738 --> 03:42:36.180]  And I think, quite frankly, it is.
[03:42:36.180 --> 03:42:40.886]  We have to remember that Deep Throat was a deputy director of the FBI at that time.
[03:42:41.406 --> 03:42:45.229]  So, we saw a coup happening there, we see an attempted coup happening here.
[03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:51.975]  Why isn't the FBI investigating the people who have leaked this information out of the intelligence community?
[03:42:51.975 --> 03:42:53.937]  Why aren't they looking at that instead?
[03:42:53.937 --> 03:42:58.581]  They're telling us, and this is what Comey said today, we do have an ongoing investigation against the Russians.
[03:42:58.581 --> 03:43:00.823]  We don't know anything, but we have a lot of innuendo.
[03:43:01.543 --> 03:43:04.185]  A lot of character assassination we're going to put out there.
[03:43:04.185 --> 03:43:10.548]  And then we got CNN saying the bizarre saga of President Trump's claims that he was wiretapped.
[03:43:10.548 --> 03:43:12.389]  There's nothing bizarre about that.
[03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:14.851]  We all know that that's happening to everybody.
[03:43:14.851 --> 03:43:24.396]  But we've had director, former CIA and former NSA director Michael Hayden say, we don't listen to bad people, we listen to interesting people.
[03:43:24.396 --> 03:43:30.360]  Do you think, John McAfee, they would have thought that Donald Trump was an interesting person when he's running for president, when he's president-elect?
[03:43:31.710 --> 03:43:33.592]  Well, if not, I don't know who is.
[03:43:33.592 --> 03:43:45.001]  But seriously, the FBI and the CIA, I know that it's a crime to do what just happened to release us.
[03:43:45.001 --> 03:43:49.524]  But good God Almighty, we need to know these things.
[03:43:49.524 --> 03:43:50.165]  I'm sorry.
[03:43:50.165 --> 03:43:55.289]  And if someone has to do a crime to do it, because the crime
[03:43:56.391 --> 03:43:59.993]  Is in having secret societies.
[03:43:59.993 --> 03:44:00.813]  Yes.
[03:44:00.813 --> 03:44:03.094]  We have 17 of them in America.
[03:44:03.094 --> 03:44:09.957]  The CIA, the NSA, the FBI, and all 14 covert agencies within the Pentagon.
[03:44:09.957 --> 03:44:12.518]  These are secret societies.
[03:44:12.518 --> 03:44:20.761]  Dwight Eisenhower and even President Kennedy warned us against the dangers of secret societies.
[03:44:21.829 --> 03:44:23.631]  And so, yes, go ahead.
[03:44:23.631 --> 03:44:25.012]  I'm glad somebody hacked it.
[03:44:25.012 --> 03:44:26.574]  I'm glad they took it out.
[03:44:26.574 --> 03:44:28.156]  And I hope the hell they get away.
[03:44:28.991 --> 03:44:34.453]  Yes, well, you know, actually, I think it's very interesting because Wicked Leaks talked about this as Vault 7 was happening.
[03:44:34.453 --> 03:44:42.095]  They said, look, they didn't copyright any of this code that they were using to burglarize everybody's computers and devices because they didn't want this to go out.
[03:44:42.095 --> 03:44:44.256]  So there's no copyright violation.
[03:44:44.256 --> 03:44:54.459]  And they didn't classify any of it because if they did, John, then they would be guilty of violating class handling classified documents by distributing this code.
[03:44:54.459 --> 03:44:56.099]  So it's not classified.
[03:44:56.099 --> 03:44:58.000]  And this is only the beginning of the Vault 7
[03:44:58.880 --> 03:44:59.721]  We're good to go.
[03:45:15.421 --> 03:45:21.242]  Between 2004-2010, the NSA was actually getting information about Donald Trump.
[03:45:21.242 --> 03:45:24.022]  They had 18 addresses of his businesses.
[03:45:24.022 --> 03:45:32.104]  They had another 8 or 9 addresses of people like his golf pro, where they were surveilling everything about him, surveilling Alex Jones.
[03:45:32.104 --> 03:45:42.086]  Now, that's information that was put out there by whistleblower, but I think Vault 7 is not really something that they can even come after them as putting out secured documents, because they're not classified.
[03:45:42.086 --> 03:45:44.606]  But even if they do,
[03:45:45.575 --> 03:45:48.378]  Please, let's get real.
[03:45:48.378 --> 03:45:56.084]  We need to change the way that we view information and especially secret information.
[03:45:56.084 --> 03:45:58.146]  We're living in the age of cyber security.
[03:45:58.146 --> 03:46:04.091]  I promise you there is not one secret in this world.
[03:46:04.091 --> 03:46:05.312]  There isn't.
[03:46:05.312 --> 03:46:08.615]  Hackers are so good that they will get whatever they want.
[03:46:09.272 --> 03:46:17.715]  And if someone wants that data from the CIA, maybe it was an inside job and someone took it, more than likely, but I don't know.
[03:46:17.715 --> 03:46:20.456]  But they can't keep it secret forever.
[03:46:20.456 --> 03:46:22.417]  This is what we don't understand.
[03:46:22.417 --> 03:46:32.481]  We've got massive cyber weapons that we've developed, enough to destroy the world a million times over, far more deadly than nuclear weapons.
[03:46:32.481 --> 03:46:35.702]  And yet those weapons can never be kept secret.
[03:46:36.644 --> 03:46:45.154]  The delusion belongs with the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI, who actually believe that they have secrets.
[03:46:45.154 --> 03:46:48.939]  Please, God, we're living in 2017.
[03:46:48.939 --> 03:46:49.920]  Wake up.
[03:46:49.920 --> 03:46:51.442]  Go to the dark web.
[03:46:51.442 --> 03:46:53.745]  There's every secret on the dark web.
[03:46:54.457 --> 03:46:55.458]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:46:55.458 --> 03:47:06.507]  And I think the point that you made earlier, and I remember when you came on our show and talked about the fact that you went on and debated Rogers and said, look, if you had that key, you're going to lose that key.
[03:47:06.507 --> 03:47:12.452]  And now we've seen that they've lost thousands of keys into people's devices through Vault 7.
[03:47:12.452 --> 03:47:18.157]  And this whole idea that you've got privacy, that you can give up your privacy to get security, that's nonsense.
[03:47:18.157 --> 03:47:21.000]  Whenever you give up your privacy, you've lost your security.
[03:47:22.165 --> 03:47:27.510]  Yes, and also that was, by the way, a hundred billion dollars put into that hacking.
[03:47:27.510 --> 03:47:29.472]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:47:29.472 --> 03:47:42.125]  Let me ask you this, because we've got a lot of articles that are up on Drudge today about robot police, we've got an air force of drones that they are talking about putting over London.
[03:47:42.125 --> 03:47:45.187]  All of this information that is being put in place
[03:47:45.788 --> 03:47:51.012]  We're looking at autonomous killing machines that DARPA is working on for the military.
[03:47:51.012 --> 03:47:54.135]  This is where it really, really gets dangerous.
[03:47:54.135 --> 03:48:01.321]  You pointed out it's already very dangerous, far more dangerous than people realize, if they can hack into nuclear power plants or whatever.
[03:48:01.321 --> 03:48:04.984]  But we are looking at an explosion in the threat level.
[03:48:04.984 --> 03:48:08.867]  As we add cars to the Internet of Things, what's going to happen to that?
[03:48:09.227 --> 03:48:16.789]  Not only are they going to destroy your privacy and monitor everything you do, but they have the ability to kill you, as we pointed out with Michael Hastings years ago.
[03:48:16.789 --> 03:48:21.971]  They can easily kill you, and they talked about that at the time, Richard Clarke did.
[03:48:21.971 --> 03:48:29.694]  By hacking your car from 3,000 miles away, think about this, leaving absolutely no tracks.
[03:48:29.694 --> 03:48:36.816]  But you talked about robot police and the evolution of cyber security and possibly AI and the Internet of Things.
[03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:44.834]  You know, I think somehow I'm 72 and I've turned a little bit cynical.
[03:48:44.834 --> 03:48:48.997]  I think there's something in the human race which is self destructive.
[03:48:48.997 --> 03:48:50.878]  I don't know what it is.
[03:48:50.878 --> 03:48:55.861]  I mean, we all love and we feel joy and love our families.
[03:48:55.861 --> 03:48:58.463]  We have grace and generosity.
[03:48:58.463 --> 03:49:04.947]  But finally, someone who does not also have greed, jealousy, anger and hatred.
[03:49:04.947 --> 03:49:05.608]  So so
[03:49:06.784 --> 03:49:11.828]  I think something within us, as a society, is self-destructed.
[03:49:11.828 --> 03:49:19.855]  And it takes a few individuals awake enough to yell the warning, Whoa!
[03:49:19.855 --> 03:49:20.756]  Stop!
[03:49:20.756 --> 03:49:21.437]  I'm one of those!
[03:49:22.148 --> 03:49:22.888]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:49:22.888 --> 03:49:33.954]  You know, I've interviewed, John, I've interviewed Hugo DeGaris about his Artilake war, where he says, hey, we're going to create artificial intelligence that's going to be so smart that it can choose to destroy us if it wishes.
[03:49:33.954 --> 03:49:43.238]  And yet, he, even though he puts that warning out there, he says, I have to do it because it's a technical challenge to create the next level of device out here.
[03:49:43.238 --> 03:49:45.579]  And I've known a lot of engineers, you're an engineer, who
[03:49:46.079 --> 03:49:51.543]  Take that bargain with the devil and say, we want to create the next impressive thing.
[03:49:51.543 --> 03:49:58.488]  It's an intellectual challenge to us, and they don't think, or if they do think about it, they don't even care about the consequences.
[03:49:58.488 --> 03:50:00.829]  That's the amazing thing to me.
[03:50:00.829 --> 03:50:02.350]  But this has been with us forever.
[03:50:02.350 --> 03:50:11.496]  I mean, when we detonated the first atomic bomb, there were some scientists who truly believed that the chain reaction would not end.
[03:50:11.496 --> 03:50:13.698]  It would simply destroy the Earth.
[03:50:13.698 --> 03:50:14.238]  And did it anyway.
[03:50:14.238 --> 03:50:15.059]  And yet they did that.
[03:50:15.836 --> 03:50:16.757]  Yeah.
[03:50:16.757 --> 03:50:22.500]  So, yes, and AI is... I'm not saying we shouldn't have AI.
[03:50:22.500 --> 03:50:23.321]  No.
[03:50:23.321 --> 03:50:25.442]  And nor have smart robots.
[03:50:25.442 --> 03:50:32.006]  But please, let's be smart enough to realize our own limitations and stupidities.
[03:50:32.006 --> 03:50:32.346]  Exactly.
[03:50:32.346 --> 03:50:40.131]  Otherwise, we're going to end up with some appendage on some massive electronic brain
[03:50:41.578 --> 03:50:43.924]  Very concerning to see where this is going.
[03:50:43.924 --> 03:50:45.347]  Stay with us, we have to take a quick break.
[03:50:45.347 --> 03:50:46.991]  We're going to be right back with John McAfee.
[03:50:59.517 --> 03:51:03.218]  Are you putting your money into an IRA, pension or 401k?
[03:51:03.218 --> 03:51:08.360]  Then I hope you're prepared to lose 30, 40, 50% or more of your retirement savings.
[03:51:08.360 --> 03:51:10.881]  Because it's not a question of if the market crashes again.
[03:51:10.881 --> 03:51:12.562]  It's a question of when.
[03:51:12.562 --> 03:51:14.142]  It's going to happen.
[03:51:14.142 --> 03:51:19.404]  Did you know there is a way you can protect and grow your wealth safely and predictably every single year?
[03:51:19.404 --> 03:51:23.806]  The people using this approach didn't lose a penny when the market crashed in 2000 or 2008.
[03:51:23.806 --> 03:51:26.427]  And they won't lose a penny in the next crash.
[03:51:26.767 --> 03:51:33.636]  In fact, their money will continue to grow safely year in and year out, even when stocks, real estate and other investments tumble.
[03:51:33.636 --> 03:51:36.960]  A free report detailing this savings program is now available.

[03:51:47.550 --> 03:51:51.191]  It far outperforms any IRA or 401k.

[03:54:10.890 --> 03:54:14.051]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:14.051 --> 03:54:16.932]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to John McAfee.
[03:54:16.932 --> 03:54:23.575]  We're talking about Vault 7, the wiretaps, the red herring of the Russians hacked our election.
[03:54:23.575 --> 03:54:28.798]  We're talking about all those issues, but I want to read for you here a quote before we go back to John and get his reaction to this.
[03:54:28.798 --> 03:54:34.340]  Actually, I want to get a positive direction for us to go from John McAfee.
[03:54:34.340 --> 03:54:38.082]  He's the person who made a fortune with McAfee antivirus software.
[03:54:38.642 --> 03:54:47.309]  We need to know what we can do, and I know that's why he ran for election, was to try to wake up the American public to the danger of what we call cyber security.
[03:54:47.309 --> 03:54:50.311]  But WikiLeaks pointed this out as we talk about this Russian hacking stuff.
[03:54:50.311 --> 03:54:50.851]  They said U.S.
[03:54:50.851 --> 03:54:57.937]  agencies have interfered with 81 elections, and that doesn't include the coups that the CIA has been involved with.
[03:54:57.937 --> 03:55:03.201]  They also point out in the last French election, remember, they're talking about, oh, the Russians are hacking the French elections.
[03:55:03.561 --> 03:55:06.862]  Possibly, but also the Americans, I'm sure, are as well.
[03:55:06.862 --> 03:55:20.747]  They say all major French political parties were targeted for infiltration by the CIA's human intelligence, that's HUMINT, and electronic SIGINT intelligence, spies, in the seven months leading up to France's 2012 presidential election.
[03:55:20.747 --> 03:55:24.868]  That would include Francois Hollande and Sarkozy and Le Pen.
[03:55:24.868 --> 03:55:30.230]  All of those people, all the political parties in France, were all infiltrated by the CIA.
[03:55:30.230 --> 03:55:32.051]  So we know they did it here in America as well.
[03:55:32.671 --> 03:55:35.873]  Coups are not limited to simply foreign governments.
[03:55:35.873 --> 03:55:41.437]  All the instruments of so-called defense abroad will be brought home as instruments of tyranny.
[03:55:41.437 --> 03:55:43.279]  We were warned about that by the founding fathers.
[03:55:43.279 --> 03:55:44.980]  James Mason told us that.
[03:55:44.980 --> 03:55:47.021]  But I want to talk to John McAfee.
[03:55:47.021 --> 03:55:54.627]  John, you ran for president, as I said, to try to draw people's attention to the vulnerabilities that we have with the cybersecurity that are developing.
[03:55:54.627 --> 03:55:56.368]  Tell us a solution.
[03:55:56.368 --> 03:55:58.590]  What can we do to try to move forward with this?
[03:55:58.590 --> 03:56:00.111]  Because you wanted people to understand this.
[03:56:00.111 --> 03:56:01.552]  Tell us some positive things here.
[03:56:03.417 --> 03:56:11.522]  First of all, I'd like to apologize for smoking on the air, but the last time I was in Alex Jones' studio, he broke his rule and allowed me to smoke.
[03:56:11.522 --> 03:56:12.183]  That's fine.
[03:56:12.183 --> 03:56:15.645]  I'm perfectly fine with you smoking.
[03:56:15.645 --> 03:56:21.048]  It might be because while I was in his studio, he left his gun outside and I had mine on me.
[03:56:21.048 --> 03:56:22.349]  So, I don't know.
[03:56:22.349 --> 03:56:25.471]  In any case, I apologize, but I do smoke.
[03:56:26.996 --> 03:56:27.837]  What can we do?
[03:56:27.837 --> 03:56:40.935]  Well, you know, I have given up hope that the citizenry themselves will dump these things called smartphones and mobile devices because they are what the CIA uses most.
[03:56:40.935 --> 03:56:41.816]  Not just the CIA.
[03:56:42.977 --> 03:56:44.638]  Every hacker in the world.
[03:56:44.638 --> 03:56:48.679]  These things are designed as spy devices.
[03:56:48.679 --> 03:56:49.500]  Literally.
[03:56:49.500 --> 03:57:09.268]  We actually had the NSA slides as part of the Snowden leaks and they said who would have thought in 1984 and they showed the pictures of the iconic Apple 1984 commercial they said who would have thought in 1984 that these and they show Steve Jobs holding up a smartphone would become Big Brother and people would line up to buy them and they showed the big crowds of the Apple stores.
[03:57:10.269 --> 03:57:11.510]  Absolutely.
[03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:19.398]  So, for the past four years I've been working on a new paradigm of cybersecurity.
[03:57:19.398 --> 03:57:22.461]  Because we all know antivirus software doesn't work.
[03:57:22.461 --> 03:57:29.828]  Every major hack, every one, was all protected by the latest antivirus software.
[03:57:29.828 --> 03:57:31.029]  It doesn't work.
[03:57:31.029 --> 03:57:32.030]  It can't work.
[03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:33.472]  Hackers don't do that anymore.
[03:57:34.298 --> 03:57:37.025]  95% of hacking is social engineering.
[03:57:37.025 --> 03:57:41.996]  Something, by the way, the CIA apparently knows nothing about.
[03:57:41.996 --> 03:57:43.980]  So, that's scary in itself.
[03:57:44.751 --> 03:57:47.632]  But, so I'm building a new set of tools.
[03:57:47.632 --> 03:58:00.857]  Number one, we just got a, my company MGT, by the way, I want to do a tangent a little later about the Securities and Exchange Commission and how they are killing business.
[03:58:00.857 --> 03:58:11.501]  But other than that, my company MGT, it's a public stock, is manufacturing, number one, the world's first
[03:58:12.662 --> 03:58:13.762]  Okay, hang on a second.
[03:58:13.762 --> 03:58:15.643]  John, we've got to take a hard break here.
[03:58:15.643 --> 03:58:18.803]  If you can hang on for another five minutes, we will let you finish that up.
[03:58:18.803 --> 03:58:21.964]  And I want to get, this will be out on the video when we put it up on YouTube.
[03:58:21.964 --> 03:58:23.084]  We're talking to John McAfee.
[03:58:23.084 --> 03:58:25.285]  Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:58:25.285 --> 03:58:26.005]  We're going to go live.
[03:58:26.005 --> 03:58:27.225]  We're going to cover Trump's rally.
[03:58:27.225 --> 03:58:29.986]  Take your phone calls as we did last week.
[03:58:29.986 --> 03:58:30.786]  7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:30.786 --> 03:58:31.106]  Eastern.
[03:58:31.106 --> 03:58:32.066]  Join us then.
[03:58:32.066 --> 03:58:33.087]  And stay with us, John.
[03:58:33.087 --> 03:58:34.407]  We're going to finish up this interview.
[03:58:34.407 --> 03:58:34.987]  We'll be right back.
[03:58:42.014 --> 03:58:46.008]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
