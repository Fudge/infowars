[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  It's Wednesday, September 15, 2021.
[00:06.560 --> 00:10.600]  The globalist deep state coup against America has now been exposed.
[00:10.600 --> 00:15.000]  Treason has been committed.
[00:15.000 --> 00:27.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  According to the newly released book, Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa,
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.400]  General Mark Milley of the Joint Chiefs of Staff committed treason.
[00:37.400 --> 00:44.500]  On October 30th of 2020, he made a top secret phone call to General Lee of the Communist Chinese Party,
[00:44.500 --> 00:48.600]  assuring him that the U.S. was not going to attack China.
[00:48.600 --> 00:53.300]  And if they ever planned to, he would call ahead of time and let them know.
[00:53.300 --> 00:58.200]  Milley made a second top secret call on January 8th of 2021,
[00:58.200 --> 01:05.200]  telling his Communist handlers that Trump was unstable and made assurances that nothing would happen.
[01:05.200 --> 01:10.000]  That same day, Milley called a secret emergency meeting at the Pentagon,
[01:10.000 --> 01:17.900]  ordering his subordinates to disobey any orders from the President of the United States without his presence.
[01:17.900 --> 01:22.500]  This is a U.S. general at one of the highest levels of our military.
[01:22.500 --> 01:30.100]  Working secretly with the Communist Chinese to undermine the lawfully elected President of the United States.
[01:30.100 --> 01:38.000]  Working secretly with the CCP, a regime that runs death camps and genocides its own people.
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.100]  Now there is no doubt why he pushes critical race theory, a CCP subversion technique,
[01:44.100 --> 01:46.400]  and plans on purging the military.
[01:46.400 --> 01:48.900]  He works for the Communist Chinese.
[01:48.900 --> 01:54.500]  This is treason at the highest level in a reasonable world, punishable by death.
[01:54.500 --> 01:58.300]  And there is no shortage of domestic enemies in America today.
[01:58.300 --> 02:01.700]  I would call General Milley a hero.
[02:01.700 --> 02:04.000]  He behaved in a heroic manner.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.900]  But what he did was ensure that guardrails were in place.
[02:07.900 --> 02:12.000]  So I give him high marks for this based on what's described in the book.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.300]  I think Milley felt ill-used by the episode on Lafayette Square when he was used as a prop.
[02:17.300 --> 02:20.000]  So one can understand Milley's anxieties.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.300]  We were in a period of extraordinary danger.
[02:23.300 --> 02:27.800]  I think General Milley is going to be treated very favorably by history.
[02:27.800 --> 02:36.100]  And just weeks ago, China was unlawfully sending battleships, including their most lethal, off the coast of Alaska.
[02:36.100 --> 02:40.200]  Will anyone be warning the U.S. of a CCP invasion?
[02:40.200 --> 02:43.200]  Are there any patriots left in the Pentagon?
[02:43.200 --> 02:51.500]  Former Navy Intelligence Officer Jack Pasobic claims that several Pentagon officers who were present in Milley's secret meeting
[02:51.500 --> 02:55.000]  are now willing to testify against him under oath.
[02:55.000 --> 03:02.500]  If there is to be any purge of the military, it is only fitting that it should begin with General Mark Milley.
[03:02.500 --> 03:21.700]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[03:21.700 --> 03:26.800]  Even among Democrats, watch these statements from just a few months ago.
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.700]  I don't think it should be mandatory. I wouldn't demand to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power.
[03:31.700 --> 03:35.200]  It's like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide.
[03:35.200 --> 03:41.600]  Can we mandate vaccines across the country? No, that's not a role that the federal government I think even has the power to make.
[03:41.600 --> 03:48.000]  We cannot require someone to be vaccinated. That's just not what we can do.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.600]  It is a matter of privacy to know who is or who isn't.
[03:51.600 --> 03:57.800]  No, definitely not. You don't want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine. We've never done that.
[03:57.800 --> 04:02.100]  We don't want to be mandating from the federal government to the general population.
[04:02.100 --> 04:05.700]  It would be unenforceable and not appropriate.
[04:05.700 --> 04:11.600]  So things are changing so quickly that the population is becoming numb to what state of affairs was just the other day.
[04:11.600 --> 04:17.600]  For a quick recap, a year ago, they were telling you maybe you shouldn't take the vaccine because Trump created it.
[04:17.600 --> 04:24.700]  A few months ago, they were assuring you. Nancy Pelosi in April assured you we're never going to require vaccines because we can't do that.
[04:24.700 --> 04:30.500]  We don't have the power. Your medical status is a matter, a sacred matter of privacy.
[04:30.500 --> 04:36.200]  Again, that was in April. On Thursday, they required vaccines. Here's where we are today.
[04:36.200 --> 04:41.300]  I would support that if you want to get on a plane and travel with other people that you should be vaccinated.
[04:41.300 --> 04:44.200]  Flying on an airplane remains a hazard.
[04:44.200 --> 04:49.800]  No one knows the vaccination status of any of the fellow passengers you're locked in this tube.
[04:49.800 --> 04:52.500]  And it's a privilege to travel.
[04:52.500 --> 05:01.200]  There's more mandates I wish you would have given. I think mandating vaccines for air travel, train travel or interstate.
[05:01.200 --> 05:08.600]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[05:08.600 --> 05:13.800]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments and other agencies,
[05:13.800 --> 05:16.500]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[05:16.500 --> 05:22.000]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.800]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[05:24.800 --> 05:29.600]  But notice, first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming,
[05:29.600 --> 05:31.600]  and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[05:31.600 --> 05:33.700]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[05:33.700 --> 05:43.100]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[05:43.100 --> 05:50.000]  They have weather control trees from 1979. Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[05:57.000 --> 06:21.000]  Yes, man-made climate change is real.
[06:21.000 --> 06:28.000]  These are the main media, the mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[06:28.000 --> 06:49.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:49.000 --> 06:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, at least for the time being, on this Wednesday, September 15 worldwide transmission.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[07:00.000 --> 07:09.000]  Again, with incredible frustration, we are the only people that know exactly what happened with General Milley and laid it out already,
[07:09.000 --> 07:16.000]  because this was already in the news and already developed. We already had sources back at the time of January 6.
[07:16.000 --> 07:25.000]  And so I'm sitting here, as all of this unfolds, watching our country already under a globalist coup.
[07:25.000 --> 07:34.000]  It wasn't that Milley was trying to carry out a coup. There was already a coup where they wouldn't follow what Trump said they would throw away as executive orders.
[07:34.000 --> 07:46.000]  They refused to pull troops out of Syria and out of Afghanistan and everywhere else.
[07:46.000 --> 07:52.000]  And this is a bureaucracy that's run in the country, in the ground, that's already sold the nation out.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  So I'm too angry at this point to do the show. It's not a dramatic effect. I just got to restart the show.
[07:58.000 --> 08:08.000]  So we're going to go to some tapes. I may not even come back. I mean, it's just, we're not a serious people.
[08:08.000 --> 08:18.000]  We don't understand what we're up against, and that's why we're getting destroyed, and we're seeing the worst scum of the earth taking control of the country.
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  I'm going to restart the show at the next segment. Don't worry, we've got a lot of important special reports, but I've got to just clear my mind,
[08:24.000 --> 08:34.000]  because this stuff is so big, so earth-shattering, so important, so over the top, that it just can't be done half-ass.
[08:34.000 --> 08:43.000]  It's got to be done with exact precision. And so I'm going to do the best job I can when we come back to do it.
[08:43.000 --> 08:56.000]  We've got a lot of really important doctors and scientists and people that need to be heard from on the whole COVID martial law takeover as well.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  And so we're going to air some of those reports here.
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  You know, maybe I should just leave today. Maybe I should just leave today.
[09:07.000 --> 09:17.000]  Not to walk off the show, but just to note how serious things are, because your government walked off a long time ago and is run by foreign criminals that are actually waging war against us,
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.000]  and literally killing everybody. I've got reports here that I've confirmed in the statistics.
[09:22.000 --> 09:33.000]  I looked it up for two hours last night, an hour this morning, that all over the country, cancers being reported are up more than 10 times.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  And so maybe that's my problem. Maybe I'm over-preparing.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  But you understand that the people running our government, running the Pentagon, are in a running big pharma, are in a war.
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  It's only Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, and the U.S. being hit with these mRNA poison shots.
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  Everybody else gets a regular vaccine. They have their problems, but nothing like this.
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  I mean, you understand that? You understand, they're killing you. They see you as their enemy.
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  I wonder if that clips on here. I know I sent it. Here, let's just read the headlines.
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  There's over 750,000 sex offenders in the U.S., and none of them have to show any proof of being registered,
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  but you're going to have to show one to go to a bar or hospital or get on a plane.
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  That's pretty big. We've got Andrew Reed, Evan, Pew, Professor of Biology and Epidemiology,
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  at Penn State on Merix disease, which I've been saying is a huge deal,
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  and it's creating like a Merix-like effect in humans. We're going to get to that clip. It's incredibly important.
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.000]  We've got Merix disease part two. That's really important.
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  And we've just got dozens and dozens of these clips I sent over to the crew here,
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  just listing how they're doing it to us, and I didn't have time today. I got here late.
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  I didn't have time to know if I had to clip with the scientist. It's a live site news, front page, infowars.com.
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  20-plus times more likely to get cancer in those that got the injection.
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.000]  Let's just read all the list here. We'll do it that way.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  My vitamins don't work if you don't take yours, just like my vaccine doesn't work if you don't take yours.
[11:16.000 --> 11:27.000]  Greatest professor sounds off on Pfizer, paying out biggest find in history for bribing doctors. That's really big.
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  Doctors refuse to carry out a COVID antibody test, because they're just saying natural immunity doesn't exist now.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  Total lots of things. The sun doesn't exist. Former President Trump reacts to new reports about General Milley.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  That's really important. We'll be getting to that early.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  Senator Reich questions Blinken on who's controlling Biden and how they keep turning his mic off.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  He just lies to him and denies it.
[11:49.000 --> 11:58.000]  Another huge statement by top doctor in Israel on national TV saying that they're seeing way more people sick and sick longer and dying than have had the vaccine.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  That's on national TV. That's clip 22.
[12:02.000 --> 12:13.000]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on here.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  But the one I wanted is not on there. Let me show you.
[12:17.000 --> 12:34.000]  It's on info wars.com. There's an article on info wars.com. Doctor reports 20 plus fold increasing cancer in his patients. He has a major diagnostics lab that goes in and does the biopsies and does the test.
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.000]  And they've got more business than they could ever have. You know what? We won't get to Milley.
[12:40.000 --> 12:46.000]  We're going to get to that when we come back here today.
[12:46.000 --> 12:58.000]  But we're really settling in here now in America, aren't we to be murdered and killed and learning that generals call the Chinese and say Trump's crazy.
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  He tried over the government two days ago, but don't worry, we'll protect you trying to self and grandize themselves with the Chinese Communist.
[13:05.000 --> 13:12.000]  All that did was made him hate us and not trust us and think what type of dishonorable criminals run the United States.
[13:12.000 --> 13:25.000]  So now they've been invading all over and threatening to invade and having ships sell off our coast and threatening to Nukes because they know it's a bunch of sycophantic criminals running the government that would undermine a president that tried to build the nation up.
[13:25.000 --> 13:34.000]  Trump was popular in China. The communists respected him, by the way, but they don't respect the likes of Joe Biden and all these criminals.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  So these little sellouts that stole the government, they think they're all powerful. They think they're all super cool.
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.000]  They think everybody thinks they're really great, but ever the whole world hates them.
[13:45.000 --> 13:56.000]  No one wants to be associated with that. No one wants to be around that. No one wants to have to sit there and deal with people like that.
[13:56.000 --> 14:09.000]  These are dishonorable trash that have taken over our country and who see the people they stole the nation from as their enemy because we are the rightful heirs to this republic.
[14:09.000 --> 14:17.000]  We the people who they're poisoning with cancer causing shots that don't worry, you're not going to have to wait a year to get cancer from your COVID shots.
[14:17.000 --> 14:26.000]  A lot of people are getting cancer within weeks, and that's what the diagnostic labs that are doing the biopsies are seeing.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  So we've got that. And so that's what we've got here.
[14:32.000 --> 14:40.000]  This whole Millie thing, maybe we can put the show headline up from the broadcast from infowars.com, the show headline for the show today.
[14:40.000 --> 14:53.000]  And if you pull it up on infowars.com, you just go to infowars.com and it says global exclusive. General Millie was part of a larger who operation being prepared by the deep state against Trump.
[14:53.000 --> 15:06.000]  Nancy Pelosi has confirmed that top Democrats working with traders in the Pentagon had prepared a plan to remove Trump from office if he didn't step down.
[15:06.000 --> 15:25.000]  Millie was developing the fake pretext with the false story that Trump was preparing to attack China with no evidence of that was to the contrary to operate the cover of the coup they were setting up.
[15:25.000 --> 15:36.000]  Is it that a big deal? And did you know yesterday when I saw this break towards the end of the show, I went, wait a minute, I remember Pelosi talking about, don't worry, the nukes are safe. I talked to Millie on TV on January 8th.
[15:36.000 --> 15:46.000]  I'm sure his hell was in CNN. And then now the media is like, oh, it's true. He's a hero. They made that all up that Trump was about to launch nuclear war with no evidence.
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  So in case they had to go take him out, that was going to be their cover that they saved the world when they're the ones endangering the whole world.
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.000]  They're the ones that are treasonous maggots. They're all a bunch of pedophiles. I mean, that's, give me a break.
[15:58.000 --> 16:08.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year. Here's why.
[16:08.000 --> 16:17.000]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:17.000 --> 16:26.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:26.000 --> 16:35.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:35.000 --> 16:47.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too. Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:47.000 --> 17:08.000]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage. Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[17:18.000 --> 17:40.000]  Have you ever thought about turning your Glock, XD family, or 1911 handgun into a semi-automatic carbine? It only takes about 30 seconds.
[17:40.000 --> 17:48.000]  The MAC Tech Carbine Upper is classified as an accessory and can be delivered right to your doorstep with no FFL or background check required.
[17:48.000 --> 17:58.000]  It's the world's most versatile pistol accessory. Build your custom upper today. Simply go to handgunconversion.com. That's handgunconversion.com.
[17:58.000 --> 18:09.000]  This headline is not a joke. This is America in September of 2020.
[18:09.000 --> 18:33.000]  T.C. Court sends man to jail for watching conspiracy theory videos online. Yes, it says the police did a spot check for, quote, compliance at his home and found him in his garage watching rumble social media site, which they say is a conspiracy site.
[18:33.000 --> 18:48.000]  Also, he admitted to watching Mike Lindell's three-day cyber symposium. Yes, it was part of the conditions of his bail. The judge said he could not look at any videos questioning the election. No joke.
[18:48.000 --> 18:57.000]  And so they sent the Stasi to his house and caught him doing it. So now he's going into solitary confinement. Communism has come to America. The republic has fallen.
[18:57.000 --> 19:16.000]  Biden and his corporate controllers are lying to you. This is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated. This is an engineered virus in a lab that they then injected into the public using their poison vaccine.
[19:16.000 --> 19:31.000]  So the body then created mutations that actually spread even worse like the Delta variant. That is scientifically admitted. That is mainline science and not even debated. But the general public does not even know that.
[19:31.000 --> 19:53.000]  So when that criminal with his pedophile crackhead son gets up there on television and tells you that you are to blame because you didn't take your poison shot, that is a giant lie. Countries like Israel and Singapore with the highest vaccine rate have the highest death and highest illness rates.
[19:53.000 --> 20:03.000]  That is the facts. Get that information out to your friends, family and strangers like your life depends on it because it does.
[20:03.000 --> 20:27.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:27.000 --> 20:38.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[20:38.000 --> 21:03.000]  So for decades, I studied the globalist plan and had seen them tested around the world. I knew they were going to roll it out through poison vaccines was their main battle plan. They were getting a lot of scenarios. And now I'm sitting here watching it unfold and watching massive increases in cancer, massive increases in heart attacks and blood clots and all these illnesses and knowing what it did in the rat studies.
[21:03.000 --> 21:13.000]  And I'm very angry and I'm very horrified. So I really am having trouble doing this show right now. There's the headline.
[21:13.000 --> 21:37.000]  Idaho doctor reports a 20 times increase in cancer in vaccinated patients. I'm going to tell you all about that coming up in two segments and then I'm going to lay a ton of news and information out ahead of all of the other big developments that we're going to be having here today.
[21:37.000 --> 21:56.000]  But when it comes to this Milly situation, I am so upset because it just confirms our worst analysis that I am ashamed of my country.
[21:56.000 --> 22:11.000]  What we become, we're just drunk on entertainment, drunk on drugs. We are completely far away from God. Our churches are captured. And then you look at that sack of unamerican filth.
[22:11.000 --> 22:29.000]  That America hating leftist poser. He's like Brian Stelter in a uniform. And that's who the globalists put in there. That's who they maneuvered in there because he's just so bad.
[22:29.000 --> 22:43.000]  Then if I just get up here and talk about this, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I mean, if I built it up for three, four days and then said, I'm going to tell you what's really going on, we'd have an extra 5 million people tune in and people would actually care or they'd pass it around.
[22:43.000 --> 22:54.000]  But if I just lay this out, you know what, I'm not going to tell you what's going on with Milly. How about that? People tend to like to not know the truth. They all think it's fun to be ignorant. We just won't go there.
[22:54.000 --> 23:03.000]  I think I'm not going to talk about Milly. Let's talk about here. Let's just look at an info or stack of news right here. Let's do that.
[23:03.000 --> 23:09.000]  I got Gavin Newsom stole the election in California. Yeah, total psychopath liar piece of garbage.
[23:09.000 --> 23:19.000]  Mayor demands school board resign over or be charged over dissemination of child pornography material. They'll all get rewards.
[23:19.000 --> 23:29.000]  We've got General Milly and all his criminal activity. Idaho doctor reports a 20 times increase of cancer in vaccinated patients. Let's just go ahead and cover that.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  A doctor has found an increase in cancer.
[23:32.000 --> 23:52.000]  Since the COVID-19, an oculation rollout. Back on March 18, Dr. Ryan Cole, a board certified pathologist and owner. Oh, I want to get on an operator of a diagnostics lab reported to the public in a video now much more stuff's been discovered produced by Idaho state government's capital clarity project.
[23:52.000 --> 24:04.000]  He is seeing a massive uptick in various auto immunices and cancers in patients who have been quote vaccinated, which is what happened at the University of Texas Fauci funded study in 2012 on rats.
[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  Since January 1 laboratory, I'm seeing a 20 times increase of.
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.000]  Indo material cancers over what I see on an annual basis.
[24:15.000 --> 24:26.000]  Reported Dr. Cole in a video clip shared on Twitter. So we have the original one from March. We have his new video. We're going to play both those for you here today.
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  And it just goes on from there.
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  He's like, gosh, I've never seen this many.
[24:34.000 --> 24:50.000]  Indo material cancers before he continued explaining his findings at a March 18 event. Cole told I don't want that the vaccine seemed to be causing serious auto immune issues in a way he described as a reverse of HIV.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  It doesn't kill your.
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  T cells that train the killer cells. It turns them off.
[24:57.000 --> 25:15.000]  Cole explained that two types of cells are required to adequately you have an immune system function helper T cells called CD4 cells and killer T cells, often known as CD8 cells.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  You know what we'll do.
[25:19.000 --> 25:26.000]  Well, we'll play all these doctors next segment and let me see my guest today.
[25:26.000 --> 25:36.000]  Andrew Torb is a great guy. He's fighting back against the globalist. He's going to be here and then J. Dyer in the fourth hour, really an expert on the great reset, the new orders on admissions.
[25:36.000 --> 25:44.000]  What they're going to do to you and your family.
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  And then I will get into Millie.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  In the second hour.
[25:49.000 --> 25:57.000]  Because I had a whole prepared analysis, all the points and the way I do it is it's all loaded in my mind.
[25:57.000 --> 26:04.000]  But then sometimes if I've got too much going on in the morning, I don't have time to line it all up and so then it just.
[26:04.000 --> 26:16.000]  And I mean it's all really there but I want to really lay it out properly and really give you a powerful analysis and that just disappeared into the ether.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  So and really what it is my anger.
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.000]  Is is is that I'm just telling you I can walk off and leave. I'm just being honest here that I want to smash this desk.
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  And I don't want to keep doing this because you know we're not really supposed to just sit here and talk about what they're doing to us.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  I mean they are murdering us, poisoning us, killing us. This is a military operation led by sacks of filth.
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.000]  Like Brian Stelter and Millie, all of them cowardly little nothing's not even men.
[26:44.000 --> 26:52.000]  I mean I'll just tell you their actions are horrible and evil and they're raping America and selling the country out and lying and persecuting and censoring and fraud.
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.000]  But the reason I'm really mad is when I see the analysis of what Millie did.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  Oh it's treason. Oh he called our enemies and said we're going to attack. I'll tell you that's illegal. Yeah you should be arrested.
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  But you know he's not going to be because they're rubbing it in right now. They put this out. They want to let you know there's a coup.
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.000]  They're rubbing you in it. But it's far worse than that.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  It was part of a larger coup plan they had where Trump was told you've got to leave or we're going to remove you.
[27:24.000 --> 27:36.000]  That basically came out and Trump basically said that and then we all sat there and got mad at Trump when it was us as a country that allowed this level of garbage to install itself like cancer throughout every strategy,
[27:36.000 --> 27:45.000]  every strata of this country. So I'm just going to control myself here. I may not be able to come back today. I'm going to during the break I'm going to decide.
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.000]  I may just need to go for a hike or something and you know we're a cursed nation.
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.000]  So the issue is all the people serving this are going to be destroyed just as much as we are.
[27:57.000 --> 28:10.000]  So at one level it just is what it is, isn't it? I mean you understand that my phone lines load up and I know a bunch of medical doctors that are the head of a major biotech company,
[28:10.000 --> 28:16.000]  one of the biggest here in Austin and they all know this behind the scenes but no one will speak up.
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.000]  I mean cancer oncology wards have never had this many people and they've all been injected.
[28:22.000 --> 28:32.000]  I mean they're murdering everybody and we're going to sit here like Aztecs or Babylonians or Druids and just let them sacrifice all of us
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.000]  because they're the authorities and we've got to kiss their ass and we live under Stockholm syndrome.
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  So I'm in a dark mood right now. I mean just looking at Millie.
[28:44.000 --> 28:52.000]  The same thing I say about Stelter, I say about him. I was going to cast somebody for a movie as a villain that kidnaps children and eats them in a gutter somewhere
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  like hit the clown, no makeup needed, you've got Millie and then the book cover fits what's on the inside, a monstrous piece of filth.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too.
[29:04.000 --> 29:11.000]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[29:18.000 --> 29:28.000]  So here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.000]  Now you'll have to sign a waiver but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[29:33.000 --> 29:44.000]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10X.
[29:44.000 --> 29:51.000]  In the best part, you can go to the StrongerDefense website right now and claim your own supply of Immune 10X without paying anything today.
[29:51.000 --> 29:59.000]  Crazy right? Learn more about this unusual limited time offer at StrongerDefense.com that's StrongerDefense.com.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[30:04.000 --> 30:12.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[30:12.000 --> 30:22.000]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[30:22.000 --> 30:31.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[30:37.000 --> 30:44.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[30:44.000 --> 30:50.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[30:50.000 --> 30:57.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming.
[30:57.000 --> 31:21.000]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[31:27.000 --> 31:39.000]  All of them telling you this, but you won't see this on the nightly news because they don't want you at the big pharma companies to understand how to protect yourself to a great extent from what's going on in the world on a routine basis.
[31:39.000 --> 31:48.000]  We now have back in stock winner son, the highest quality vitamin D three with vitamin K for your body's immune system back in stock sold out for months.
[31:48.000 --> 31:51.000]  It is essential. It is vital and it is 50% off.

[31:59.000 --> 32:06.000]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[32:06.000 --> 32:13.000]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[32:13.000 --> 32:23.000]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions, natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[32:26.000 --> 32:32.000]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul.
[32:32.000 --> 32:39.000]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[32:39.000 --> 32:44.000]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[32:44.000 --> 32:53.000]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal.
[32:53.000 --> 33:11.000]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[33:24.000 --> 33:29.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[33:29.000 --> 33:35.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.000]  Alright, next hour I'm going to lay out the big picture.
[33:39.000 --> 33:46.000]  And what's insane is no one is saying this, no one has gotten this, it is not in the news.
[33:46.000 --> 33:54.000]  Other than, I saw Jack Pasobic pointing it out yesterday because he's smart and he worked in Naval Intelligence then worked in some other areas.
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  And so he knows how this stuff operates, he's got connections.
[33:57.000 --> 34:08.000]  But if we don't get out what's really happening, if Congress doesn't get it, if Trump doesn't get it, if Rand Paul doesn't get it, I've seen their statements about this.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  Then what hope do we have?
[34:11.000 --> 34:18.000]  I personally told Trump when he was president-elect that they're spying on you and using all that information against him.
[34:18.000 --> 34:25.000]  I told him specifically he was doing it because they had bragged in some of their sub-publications how they were doing it.
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  And then it turned out it was true.
[34:27.000 --> 34:36.000]  Well, it turns out these criminals bragged how they were preparing to remove Trump claiming that he wanted to use the nuclear weapons, which wasn't true.
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  They used that false claim to organize the coup and Millie had them sign allegiances to him.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  I have it all right here.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  Open and shut.
[34:45.000 --> 34:53.000]  This wasn't just treason to a foreign power, our main adversary, which they tell us the patriots were involved with Russia with no evidence.
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  This is total evidence.
[34:54.000 --> 35:03.000]  It's that they were organizing that as a coup against Trump and admitted it on NBC News, CNN and everywhere else.
[35:03.000 --> 35:07.000]  As soon as I saw this story yesterday, I was like, oh yeah, I remember Pelosi talked about that.
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.000]  Remember, they were saying, oh, don't worry, after the January 6th, we'll stop him.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  You know, we're in control of the military.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  They admitted it.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  They're the ones that brought it out.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  What Bob Woodward is saying is true.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  But they're proud of it.
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  That's what's so sick about this.
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.000]  And even if they did this and Trump was really looking at that because of China threatening places, that's one thing, but we elected Trump.
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  So that's bypassing our republic.
[35:38.000 --> 35:39.000]  But he didn't even do that.
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  It's on record.
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  He was going into Daytona with China at that point and North Korea.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  And of course, Trump responded to that and said, this is crazy.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  China was starting to warm up to our deals.
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  We've made these deals.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  So it's beyond serving China, he serves himself.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  He could have triggered a nuclear war calling up.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  They have the military said, well, do I launch an attack?
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  He said, no, I'll let you know if we launch one.
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  Well, that's how you think he said, well, then I may launch an attack.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  And all of our allies are listening in on this call on record.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  They're like, what the hell?
[36:12.000 --> 36:19.000]  And they started calling the NSA and others saying, is there a military coup in America?
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  Is General Milley the president?
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  Because you know, that's what happened in Rome.
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.000]  Two thousand.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  50 years ago.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  60 years ago now.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  Roughly.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  Look up when Caesar got killed, folks.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  I forget.
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.000]  Like 40 something years before the birth of Christ.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  And it happens in third world countries all the time.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  You see this.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  Well, it happens in Africa, Latin America and Asia.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  And here it is happening in America.
[36:47.000 --> 36:53.000]  Like we're Myanmar or something.
[36:53.000 --> 36:59.000]  And what's frightening is they're the ones that are dangerous.
[36:59.000 --> 37:09.000]  Oh, but he apologized in his photo op role when Trump walked around the streets and showed the burned down church and said it was wrong as just a sign of strength.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  He could have called out the military.
[37:11.000 --> 37:21.000]  Oh, but Milley doesn't mind being political when he is on his knees and Congress saying critical race theories good and white people attack the Capitol and white people are the main terror threat.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  Don't you get it?
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  I'm going to lay it out next hour.
[37:26.000 --> 37:39.000]  I'm going to lay out how they're preparing for war and gun confiscation, how they said we're the main terror threat, how Biden has announced that in his June report and how they were planning this all day one, even if they couldn't have stolen the election from Trump.
[37:39.000 --> 37:48.000]  They were planning to have a 25th Amendment coup against him claiming he was about to start a war with China because all he did was sign on to standing up to them.
[37:48.000 --> 37:54.000]  In the 40 year trade war they were in with us that we never fought back against.
[37:54.000 --> 38:01.000]  And the globalists had all prepositioned their investments and everything else they did in China.
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.000]  And so that's their investment going down when Trump stands up to them and brings jobs back to America.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  Trump got us out of Afghanistan.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  Trump was doing peace deals with North Korea.
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  Trump got us out of Syria.
[38:13.000 --> 38:24.000]  And Milley, remember, the Pentagon ignored the president and the left is celebrating that and celebrating surveillance and celebrating censorship.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  So we're not, here's the big announcement, and it's a big announcement.
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  And I'll be honest, I don't ever have problems speaking to a big crowd.
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  I don't have any anxiety on national TV.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  This isn't like a choking or butterflies in my stomach.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  It's more like a rage.
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  I have trouble presenting this because it's not a pride issue.
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.000]  It makes me mad that they're on top of us and we can't get them off our backs.
[38:51.000 --> 39:02.000]  We live in a plutocratic oligarchy of bureaucrats and special interests and billionaires and trillion dollar companies that control them.
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  A society of criminals.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  We live in a bureaucratic dictatorship of people that just don't want to be in control.
[39:10.000 --> 39:21.000]  They fundamentally hate America because the globalists in the last 70 years had to recruit people that hated the country because why would you want to get rid of something so good?
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  Like free market and self-defense and sovereignty and all of it.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  We weren't perfect, but way above everybody else.
[39:27.000 --> 39:37.000]  5% of the wealth in 1950, 4% of the world population, 50% of the wealth in 1950, 4% of the population.
[39:37.000 --> 39:44.000]  We had half the world's wealth and it was in the middle class and the average person's hands.
[39:44.000 --> 39:45.000]  We had created it.
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  We had generated it.
[39:46.000 --> 39:52.000]  We had made all these inventions and all these things and been hardworking and it had delivered.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  And now what do you have?
[39:54.000 --> 40:00.000]  Drug addiction, laziness, stupidness, Satanism, pedophilia around the muck, a cursed nation.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  Because we got fat and happy and let the evil come in and take over.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back with all the COVID news.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  It's huge.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  A bunch of the COVID news, my God.
[40:09.000 --> 40:19.000]  And then on the next hour, I'm going to nail Millie and nail it on the wall and just homely explain the whole track.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  What happened?
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  And here's the frustrating part.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  We need massive awakening to this.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  Or Millie doesn't get in trouble because you could bring down Millie.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  You could bring down the whole deep state, the whole criminal cabal.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  It's like the string on the sweater that it unravels the whole sweater.
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.000]  Or it's like you knock a hole in the dam and the water's coming through and the whole thing breaks down.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  But instead, they're like, well, why?
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.000]  He's a Chinese agent.
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  He was calling him.
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  He's a trader.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  They're like, oh, no, he saved us by doing that.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  That gives them their fake argument.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  No.
[40:54.000 --> 41:05.000]  They were, he was lying, saying Trump was going to nuke somebody with no evidence to have the military pledge allegiance to him and sign an agreement not to follow the president's orders.
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  That's the treason.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  That's the coup.
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.000]  And he called Schumer and Pelosi and others to get them on board.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  And he would they and they would he.
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  That's the issue.
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  That's the and no one it's nowhere.
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  No one is talking about Pelosi that I've seen other than the articles from January 8.
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  Pelosi says she spoke to General Millie about Trump and the nuclear codes.
[41:30.000 --> 41:38.000]  Do you understand that's why we've got to stay on air despite all the attacks that I don't even get into with you.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  So listen to me.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  I'm not going to give you the whole backstory and I'm not going to whine and complain about it.
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  But if you want this place to be on air in a year.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  I need you to fund us.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  I need everybody to go by the supplements and the water filters and the air filters.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  Everybody already needs horrible food.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  One month, six months a year, three months.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  We've got provisions you need.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  We've got quality products and we're fighting for you.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  And I'm fighting for myself and my family.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  I need to stay on air and you need these products.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  Winter sun, vitamin D three highest quality taken under the tongue for your immune system and everything else for your body.
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  It's essential.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  50% off.
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.000]  X2 for your immune system, your whole body, so many people are deficient in iodine.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  It's the best deep breath crystal source.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  Nobody's got better.
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  Nobody's got this.
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.000]  Nobody's got something that's good.
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  50% off.
[42:23.000 --> 42:28.000]  Ultra 12, highest quality, vitamin B12, highest grade taken under the tongue for higher absorption.
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  Again, immune system, stamina, libido, your mind, your health, everything.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  And I will continue to fight as hard as I can.
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  At some point soon, I'm going to tell you about some of the stuff that's going on, but it's strategic.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  That is just unbelievable.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  It's fine.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  I expect that.
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.000]  But I'm just saying on every front, they are moving to shut this country down in bullies and to submission and we're not going to do it.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  So keep me in the fight.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  We also have a new shirt that will trigger leftist.
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  I hate Alex Jones, the troller.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the New World Order.
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  And Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[43:11.000 --> 43:18.000]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers through the U.N.
[43:18.000 --> 43:25.000]  And they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want, when they want, and to have the global, digital, tracking,
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone of their new world ID.
[43:31.000 --> 43:40.000]  And now their puppet bite has announced the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  This is criminal.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  And he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  They say that's a 20, 25, maybe they just expanded the emergency authorization.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.000]  Well, you live to see an absolute new world order, world government.
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[43:58.000 --> 44:09.000]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design
[44:09.000 --> 44:14.000]  and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[44:18.000 --> 44:25.000]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in.

[44:50.000 --> 44:55.000]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.

[47:03.000 --> 47:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.000 --> 47:40.000]  You got to serve somebody.
[47:40.000 --> 47:51.000]  And we know the globalists serve the commander of this world as Bob Dylan said he sold a soul to Satan for power.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  Bob Dylan is deadly serious about that.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  At least he's honest about it.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  He tried to go to Christ but the devil was just too strong he says.
[48:00.000 --> 48:06.000]  Oh, but there is no devil in the atheist say, most atheists are Satanists in my experience.
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.000]  Now, well, they're just fools that had parents that were too religious and abused them so they hate God.
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  But there is a good force in the universe.
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.000]  There is a bad force.
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  The good force made the universe the bad force is our free will.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  When we choose bad it manifests that it exists in so many permutations.
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  It is a spirit.
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  It is an entity.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  It is a particular creature.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  But we've got a little bit of it in all of us.
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.000]  Don't we? When we get into it, we make it stronger.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  All right, I'm starting to settle down a little bit.
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  This really thing.
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  And then killing everybody with these poison shots.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  I know you're all going through this too.
[48:48.000 --> 48:56.000]  I looked at photos of the gentleman we had on the broadcast last week and over the weekend.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  Ernest Ramirez, his son Ernest Ramirez Jr. Ernesto Jr.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  was in good shape, played basketball.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  He had a giant heart attack and died with no congenital problems.
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  He just died from the Pfizer, excuse me, from the Moderna shot.
[49:11.000 --> 49:21.000]  He's been censored off GoFundMe, cancels grieving father's fundraiser for son after he raised $10,000 to buy ads on the internet and things
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  and warn people about the shots and promote boost posts about his son so he could warn others.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  It makes him feel better, understand it does, and it helps people.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  Well, they said you can't do that. You can't criticize anybody.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  We're going to kill you. We're going to kill your family.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  That's the way it is.
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.000]  You can boost his videos. They're at Bandot video, but the enemy rocks around the clock.
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  And I meant to tell the crew this, but will you guys go to Ernesto's Twitter please?
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  He just started.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Had like five followers last week.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  It's got thousands now.
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  Thanks to the listeners going there and supporting him.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  He'll probably get banned off there, but at least his son won't go without a fight.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  Yeah, scroll down.
[49:58.000 --> 50:04.000]  It's a picture of his son in the casket with daddy saying goodbye.
[50:04.000 --> 50:12.000]  I couldn't imagine my 18 year old son or my 17 year old daughter or my 13 year old daughter or my four year old daughter saying bye to them and then closing the coffin.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  I've been there with grandparents and uncles and stuff.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  And it's incredibly hard to do.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  It's on the Twitter page here. I'll show it to you.
[50:22.000 --> 50:28.000]  And so, you know, that's the type of thing that goes on in this society.
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  So let's blow that picture up for TV viewers.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  Let's show the dead son.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  That's a human being.
[50:35.000 --> 50:44.000]  That's a real person that was 16 and a single family dad that he'd raised as his little boy.
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.000]  A big nice family, almost all of veterans, and now he's in the ground here in Austin.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  That's where he's going to stay.
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  He doesn't get to grow up and get a wife and have children.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  He doesn't get to join the army like his daddy.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  He doesn't get to climb mountains.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  He doesn't get to swim in the ocean.
[51:00.000 --> 51:13.000]  He doesn't get to see sunsets anymore because he got murdered by Bill Gates and Fauci who are aided by all the lawyers, all the politicians and all the general millies of the world and all the slime.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  I think they're better than us and think there's too many of us and say they're saving the earth by killing us.
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  Well, I say then you should take yourselves out first.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  You monsters, you killers.
[51:25.000 --> 51:33.000]  So let's just leave Ernest Jr. up there with Ernest Sr. for people to look at of their TV viewers.
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  Just go look at the dead, murdered young man.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  Look at him.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  Look at him.
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  Instead, you go to Ernest's Twitter and there's leftist attacking on your son.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  It's safe and effective.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  How dare you try to get attention?
[51:51.000 --> 51:59.000]  Some of them even have names like I'm with Pfizer and you go find out they work for drug companies.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  A lot of them are bots.
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  These are the people that give you the fake news about Ivermectin killing you.
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  They're the ones that get the fake news to get it banned in Australia.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  Australia, by the way, can't stand India.
[52:11.000 --> 52:16.000]  India now has entire cities completely free of any COVID with Ivermectin.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  They declared whole states free of it.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  The government issues it.
[52:20.000 --> 52:28.000]  They're talking about indicting the head health minister who tried to block it for crimes against humanity.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  But Ernest was told you got to go get it.
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  Ernest Jr. was like, yeah, I don't want to stay locked in the house.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  They followed the directives of the system.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  Like his daddy said, I used to trust the government.
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  Now I don't.
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  I love my country, but I hate my government.
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.000]  I don't trust my government.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.000]  Yeah, you put that headline back up.
[52:50.000 --> 52:54.000]  There it is for you.
[52:54.000 --> 52:58.000]  Uttar Pradesh, India announced the state is COVID free.
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.000]  Proving the effectiveness of the deworming drug Ivermectin.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  So let me let me play this for you.
[53:05.000 --> 53:16.000]  Idaho doctor reports a 20 times increase of cancer at his cancer diagnostic lab that I looked up is the biggest in his region.
[53:16.000 --> 53:17.000]  Not just his city.
[53:17.000 --> 53:27.000]  Those are respected lab diagnostic lab that test blood samples that the test tumors that test the sample Senate.
[53:27.000 --> 53:40.000]  And they're saying, man, we got a 20 fold increase in business, baby, of a particular type of cancers that are tied in the rat studies to other coronavirus vaccines.
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.000]  Because it's these viruses associated with cancer and their spike protein.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  And now your body's producing at the cellular level.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  It creates blood clots.
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  It creates cancer.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  It attacks the testicles, the ovaries, the uterus, and you see it all there.
[53:54.000 --> 53:59.000]  Oh, and I got articles, mainline news going, oh, yeah, a lot more people are getting cancer.
[53:59.000 --> 54:05.000]  That's just a side effect of the shot.
[54:05.000 --> 54:09.000]  So here is the doctor talking about it.
[54:09.000 --> 54:19.000]  We're seeing in the laboratory after people get these shots, we're seeing a very concerning locked in low profile of these important killer T cells that you want in your body.
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  It's almost a reverse HIV.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  In HIV, you lose your helper T cells, your CD4 cells.
[54:24.000 --> 54:30.000]  In this virus post vaccine, what we're seeing is a drop in your killer T cells, your CD8 cells.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  And what does CD8 cells do?
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  They keep all other viruses in check.
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  What am I seeing in the laboratory?
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  I'm seeing an uptick of herpes family viruses.
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.000]  I'm seeing herpes.
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.000]  I'm seeing shingles.
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  I'm seeing mono.
[54:41.000 --> 54:48.000]  I'm seeing a huge uptick in human papilloma virus in the cervical biopsies and the cervical pap smears in women.
[54:48.000 --> 54:54.000]  In addition to that, there's a little infectious bump the kids get called maluskin contagiosin.
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  What do you need to keep that in check?
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  You need CD8 killer T cells.
[54:57.000 --> 55:03.000]  I am seeing a 20 times increase in individuals over the age of 50 of this little bump in rash.
[55:03.000 --> 55:10.000]  That's innocuous, but what it tells me is the immune status of these individuals who have gotten the shot.
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  We're literally weakening the immune system of these individuals.
[55:14.000 --> 55:21.000]  Now, most concerning of all is there's a pattern of these types of immune cells in the body that keep cancer in check.
[55:21.000 --> 55:30.000]  Well, since January 1 in the laboratory, I've seen a 20 times increase of endometrial cancers over what I see on an annual basis.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  A 20 times increase.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.000]  I'm not exaggerating at all because I look at my numbers year over year.
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  Oh my gosh, I've never seen this many endometrial cancers before.
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  I'm seeing invasive melanomas in younger patients.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  Normally we catch those early in their thin melanomas.
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.000]  I'm seeing thick melanomas skyrocketing in the last month or two.
[55:50.000 --> 55:58.000]  I'm already seeing the early signals and we are modifying the immune system to a weakened state.
[55:58.000 --> 56:07.000]  Great study out of Germany that looked at these profiles on young individuals after the Pfizer showing this locked in.
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  And we don't know how long maybe the immune system is going to regenerate and those ratios will go back up.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  But who's studying it?
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  And where are the long-term trials?
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  Two months, four months, how long is this profile locked in?
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  We don't know.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  Oh, it's safe and effective, but we didn't do the studies.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  And now they lied and said they did the studies and now admit they didn't.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  Folks, what was Fauci over?
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  The HIV program blocking drugs that help people.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  What did HIV do?
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  He killed the T lymphocytes.
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  Those are the white blood cells that train the other white blood cells.
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  The killer T's what to do.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  Now they've just hit us with something else that turns off the killer T's.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  And you know, look it, look it.
[56:44.000 --> 56:51.000]  Roger Stone's wife took the Pfizer shot and within a month had cancer in the lymphomas.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  In the lymph nodes, excuse me.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  So this is it.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  And it's what was in the rat studies too.
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.000]  And so here we are.
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  And you see all these executives and rich people dying from the shots too.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  You know, this is a planetary attack.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  But look at the countries that are taking it.
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the UK.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  Nobody else in the world is.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  Isn't it funny?
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  The UN tells us Europe's bad.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  White people are bad.
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  The West is bad.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  Anybody that lives here is bad because it's the idea of freedom and jurisprudence
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  and the whole Christian ethos that the system wants to get rid of
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  because it's bringing in globalism.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  Yeah, Kathy Griffin got her vaccine.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  Now she's got lung cancer, which is directly associated with.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  All right, we're going to come back and I'm going to get into the milly thing.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  Greg reaches an excellent report at Bandot video that's extremely powerful.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  Going with his treason as well.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  I suggest you share it if you don't want to roll over and just die to these people.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  But this is it.
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.000]  This is the depopulation.
[57:48.000 --> 57:56.000]  This message is not for our regular listeners who are informed and understand about the value of essential vitamins and minerals,
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.000]  meaning if you don't have them, you die long term.
[57:59.000 --> 58:00.000]  It's for new listeners.
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.000]  The power structure works around the clock to try to debilitate you and try to make them sickly.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  Please research because this is life and death.
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.000]  Vitamins that are essential and minerals that are essential.
[58:11.000 --> 58:12.000]  Just type that into a search engine.
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  You will see the top universities, CDC, all of them telling you this,
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  but you won't see this on the nightly news because they don't want you at the big pharma companies
[58:21.000 --> 58:27.000]  to understand how to protect yourself to a great extent from what's going on in the world on a routine basis.
[58:27.000 --> 58:33.000]  We now have back in stock winner's son, the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.000]  for your body's immune system back in stock, sold out for months.
[58:37.000 --> 58:43.000]  It is essential, it is vital, and it is 50% off so you have no excuse but to get it for yourself and your family.
[58:43.000 --> 58:49.000]  Winner's son, back in stock 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[58:49.000 --> 58:55.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[58:55.000 --> 59:01.000]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection
[59:01.000 --> 59:05.000]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[59:10.000 --> 59:15.000]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening,
[59:19.000 --> 59:24.000]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[59:31.000 --> 59:36.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[59:36.000 --> 59:40.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[59:40.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Alright, some stages don't carry this first five minutes, but a lot of them do,
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  and a lot of people tune in on the internet, millions, so I'm going to hit the milly stuff starting next segment,
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  so start your engines.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  I want to play a billionaire miner who built himself out of nothing from rags or riches,
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  but he's a patriot, Clive Holmer.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  He's not only a billionaire mining man, he's also a freedom fighter,
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  and he's warning Australians what this power grab is really all about.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  Then I want to play Tucker Carlson, nurses refusing the vaccines because they know,
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  and then Tucker Carlson on how the DMs were against the mandates.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Then I'll be back with the big General Milley report.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  What would you say right now to the people of New South Wales?
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  16 on 100 cases, 800 cases today, whatever they're up to at the moment.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  It's horrible what's going on, and there's people dying in hospital.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Hang on, we've seen people dying in hospital.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  They're not dying of fake disease, they're dying of COVID-19.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  You're up here today, it's irresponsible.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Well, I don't believe that.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  What would you say to those business owners that can't open their business?
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  I would say it's terrible.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Their Premier is telling them that the only way out is a double jab, and that's what they've been told.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  I'd say their Premier is lying to them.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  I'd say that she's under an eye-cack inquiry,
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  but a particular lobbyist in Sydney controls the Liberal Party in Sydney
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  and has told her that the only way she gets out of that inquiry is if she pushes the double jab,
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  and his clients are Aska Zenica, and his clients are Pfizer.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  That's what I'd say.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  If you let me answer your question, I'll answer it.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  You're just answering with eye-cack drillers.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  No, that's what I'd say.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  You asked me.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  People that are trying to open their businesses,
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  people that have been told they have to double jab.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  I'm going to be the answer to the question to start with.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  That's what I'd tell them, and I'd say that what the Premier's telling them is not true,
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  and that that policy, they shouldn't be locked down, businesses should be opened,
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  and the government's using this as an excuse to destroy them.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  They know that.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Do you think that the Premier of New South Wales wants to destroy businesses?
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  I do.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Why would she do that?
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Because as I try to explain to you,
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  that she's being directed by a lobbyist in Sydney
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  who's being paid by Aska Zenica and by Pfizer,
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  tens of millions of dollars to get these policies through
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  to make sure the vaccine is pushed.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  That's why. You asked the question, I gave you the answer.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  And that's my personal knowledge, and I'm happy to make a statement here
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  to police or to anyone if they want to know what's going on.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  You can't have a statement.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  Well, that's all. I'll be doing that, but they'll be named.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  But not only that.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  Now, I've got another clip of him.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  There's so many where he talks about the plan is keep you locked in your homes
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  for small businesses to bankrupt into the big corporations and consolidate power.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  And he is trying to run TV ads or trying to block them.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  He's trying to run print ads or not taking them.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  So now he's been reaching out to millions of Australians
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  spending tens of millions of his own money,
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  sending him messages about what's really behind all this
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  and sending him to websites so they can learn how they're being taken over.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  And the government is moving to block him being able to talk to people.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  And you saw how at a press conference when the only men fighting back,
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  they won't shut up. They won't let him talk when he has a press conference
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  because they are bought and paid for.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  And Pfizer all over the world, as Trump said,
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  through Gates owns the medical regulators in one state of Australia,
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  one province, tens of millions of dollars to the medical boards.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  That's what they get up there and say,
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  we're going to keep giving you shots forever.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  I mean, the head, the national spokesperson, the woman said yesterday,
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  she clarified last week, she said, yeah, you're never going to end.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  The lockdowns are never going to end.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  The police, COVID rapid response deals are permanent
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  and you're going to take shots whenever we say.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  So get that through your heads, folks, and I'm talking to new listeners.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  You think you can ply?
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Israel's already up to their fourth injection.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  Oh, you took the third, how about a fourth?
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  And they have the highest rate of illness and death in the world.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  And I've got Australian TV admitting all this
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  and I've got so much more.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  I've got Israeli TV admitting it as well.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  and I'm going to just talk about the dire straits we're in.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Because if you think what's happening bad is as bad as it's going to get,
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  you're thinking wrong.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  We'll be right back today with us.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about my NASA
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  and other governments and other agencies,
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  and then there's going to be global warming
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  and Bill Gates and the UN?
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  They have weather control trees from 1979.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you for joining us.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  We start the second hour of this live Wednesday, September 15th, Transmission.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  Well, it isn't about being right.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  It isn't about having news and information other people don't have.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  It's about getting it out to people
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  so that the general public has a knowledge of what they're facing
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  so that we can all make good decisions and stop the world government corporate takeover
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  and its end game of deindustrialization and depopulation.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  So this is a life-and-death situation and as soon as the public of the world,
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  not just the U.S. figures out, but the more you go along with the UN,
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  the more you go along with the Fortune 500,
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  the more you go along with Klaus Schwab,
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  the more you go along with Hollywood and the Liberals and the Leptas and the Communists
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  and all of this, the more poor and pathetic and alone and desperate you're going to be
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  and they think you're so stupid that as this process takes place in the next few years,
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  we're already deep into it, you won't put two and two together that 15 days to cut the curve,
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  to flatten the curve becomes, man, this 15 days to flatten the curve really gets rough at 18 months
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  and now learning it's permanent.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Oh, we're going to get rid of the lockdowns.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Oh, they're going to come back in November, says Boris Johnson.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Same thing in Canada.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  What you see around the world is what they're trying to implement here,
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  but we have more checks and balances, but those are eroding very quickly
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  and that leads me to General Milley.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  If I try to list all the sycophantic anti-American white people are racist,
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  white rage attacked the capital garbage, it would take all day.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  We know how bad Milley is and people say, well, why was he chosen as a chairman?
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Because he was the next guy in line out of the military and Trump romanticizes the military
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  and doesn't understand that's all John Wayne movies and maybe it was true back then,
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  but nowadays these are globalists that are sent to special think tanks
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  and special Harvard sub-degrees, they get in like six months,
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  when they're already kernels to show their globalist and to show they've kissed the ring
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  and then they're put up to the top.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  They don't recruit people to be four star generals because they're war heroes from World War One
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  and work 18 hours a day and do a great job.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  They end up being, you know, the supreme commander, allied commander in World War Two
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  or they don't end up coming from a central Texas town, never even seen a ship
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  and then he does good in the Navy so he becomes the head of the US Navy Admiral Nimitz.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  That was back then was on merit.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  America was about getting away from nobility, getting away from who your daddy was
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  and really what you stood for.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  But with Millie, it's because he is a globalist, anti-gun, anti-American bag of filth.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  But let's move on from Millie.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Millie was called and vice versa by Pelosi and by Schumer and all of them.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  They now admit they were talking the entire time
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  and they needed to develop a plan to organize a coup and to go to the Secretary of Defense
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  and to go to the Joint Chiefs and say, you swear allegiance to Millie,
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  we're not going to follow any orders that Trump gives us to attack China.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  And they even admit, because they know there's no recordings of it or proof,
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  he never said we're going to attack China.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  He never inferred he wanted peace with China and North Korea,
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  got us out of Syria, which Millie secretly ignored along with Dumford.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Talk about traders.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  And it expands on that.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  We also got out of Afghanistan, which they then sabotage to make peace look like a bad thing.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  So that's how they operate.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  But we have Pelosi hiding in plain view back on January 8th of this year saying,
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  Millie called me and said he's got control of the nukes, not Trump.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  And I remember them right around that time saying, don't worry,
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  Millie always has another general there with him and no one's out of town,
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  so someone's there to always control Trump.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  This is while Millie is in there and Trump would call him in and say,
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  did you say that?
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  He'd say, no, sir, I didn't.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  That's a lie.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Lying to the president as the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman is treason, is a felony.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  Just like the Secretary of State lied to play this coming up in Congress yesterday.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  They said, hey, they keep cutting the mic off of Biden.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  We've got like 20 clips of it.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  He goes, no, sir, we never done that.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  He's a really bad liar.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  No, it's like a weasel just caught with a hen in its mouth and the henhouse said,
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  no, we don't control him.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  We never cut his mic.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  And so it's that same level of lying.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And it's all a bunch of backstabbing bureaucrats and social climbers and garbage
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  that are run by lobbyists and big banks that are buying and selling control on the planet.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  But even the trillion dollar companies, even the bankers don't run anything.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  They control their minions who all backstab each other.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  And so they wanted to make sure Trump didn't run anything.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  But in the process, it's a giant committee of hundreds of people that make the decisions
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  within thousands of little scheming bureaucrats like Millie, who then to undermine the president
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  made up a story to Congress and back and forth that he might use nukes to do that
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  in case they had to take him out or in case he didn't leave office or in case he challenged the election.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  And Millie also told the Chinese general and Pelosi.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  You've got the transcripts right here, which they confirm are real.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  Because they're proud of it. They're hiding it in plain view that he told the Chinese
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  and he told Pelosi and Schumer, Trump tried to overthrow our government.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  And he might try it again. Trump wasn't part of that capital thing.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  I was there. We all got set up. A million people came to hear him speak.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  He was lied to and told there was a stage set up in all this garbage.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  We didn't check. We get down there and it's all a setup.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  And they had provocateurs ready to invade the capital.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  The police opened the doors after the provocateurs get them open and wave everybody in because they were ordered to
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  not blaming the police. They were ordered to. That's compartmentalization.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  So they ran that whole thing. They bragged in Time Magazine months after how they had the coup against Trump
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  and how all these forces worked together in media and Republicans and Democrats and top generals
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  and top PR firms with lawyers and how this top professor orchestrated the whole thing.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  And as the greatest conductor ever, they're bragging.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  So I have the articles with Pelosi saying, don't worry. They never let him alone.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  Don't worry. The nukes are safe. Got him right here. Here's one right here.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  January 8th.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  And then we've got the open letter that Trump was never given because they weren't in writing
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  where he told the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all their adjunct officers,
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  you will pledge allegiance to me and you will only take orders from me for military action,
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  not President Trump.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  You heard that? Got it right here. Then he added, only if it's written,
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  but he knows Trump's dictating and they throw that in the trash,
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  just like all those executive orders to stop the globalist and criminal activities.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  So there's your coup, but notice the inversion. Trump was involved in the coup.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  Trump was going to cause nuclear war. Trump was going to attack China.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  Trump was going to attack. No, Trump was going to get us out of these wars.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Trump was going to bring our troops home and do it properly.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Trump was trying to make bills and build condos and resorts in North Korea.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Empower your people. Be like South Korea. What a sales job with a whole produced CG,
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  new North Korea and had Kim Jong-un sold, but then they undermined it and screwed the whole deal up.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  And China doesn't want North Korea to be prosperous.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  So these people want us poor and pathetic and falling apart and starving in the dark alone.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  Then you have Pelosi out surveying the troops in front of the Capitol and nodding at them
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  and having all wear their mask while they fed them dog food, made them sleep on the garage floor
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  and the big fence up around it. You know the insurrection, the worst attack in U.S. history.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  And then horse to 9-11, horse to Pearl Harbor and then Millie goes up with that other anti-American gun-grabbing crook, Austin,
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  and says, wait a minute, I want to know about why white people attacked.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  I want to know why it was a racial attack.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  You just made it a racial attack, people protesting a million people and 600 being waived by the police,
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  maybe 20, 30, 40 attacked the cops.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  The total script of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, the Democratic Party,
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  all of the American people are terrorists.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  That the American people are the enemy. They're about to blow everything up.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  The new National Security Directive of June that Biden signed saying the main threat is that China or Russia or Al-Qaeda
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  or the Taliban, it's the American people.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  And now you hear that talking point from Michael Moore and Chuck Schumer and the Sunday talk shows
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  and the nightly comedy shows that you know we need the troops back out of Afghanistan
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  for the American people, for these right-wingers, for those that question lockdowns
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  and deny them medical care while you're at it.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  And they're signing on UN treaties to take the guns.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  This is the takeover by a UN multinational corporate takeover.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  And they'll sit back in Europe in their palaces and their castles while we all kill each other
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  and while they give us deadly shots and they depopulate the old people, they don't want to pay their pension funds.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  I mean, this is 21st century war. We'll come back and explain the real trees and stay with us.

[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10x.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  In the best part, you can go to the StrongerDefense website right now and claim your own supply of Immune 10x
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  without paying anything today. Crazy, right?
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Learn more about this unusual limited time offer at StrongerDefense.com.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s. And then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established, where members of Congress and former presidents are censured by big tech, and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body that you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  Think about that, because that's where we are. Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  But it is happening now. And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you got to take it every few months.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus. And that's in mainline studies. Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food. We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits, because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  Music playing.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a globalist Frankenstein we got to deal with now.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  And the monster is out of control, doing whatever it wants, wherever it wants, injecting us with Frankenshots that are killing people and maiming them en masse.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  So let me lay the heavy information on you.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  General Millie that looks like a little stunted overweight Frankenstein and acts like an absolute globalist trader engaged in treason when he called the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Chicoms that runs giant death camps everywhere and says they want to destroy the U.S.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  Center have bought off half our politicians and said Trump tried to overthrow things but I'm in control and we're going to stop him from attacking you and the general freaked out and said should I launch an attack?
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  Oh my God. And the Chinese all went crazy and almost attacked us because this guy wanted to ingratiate himself with the Chicoms because he'd been told to do this by Schumer and Pelosi and the globalist and he knew those were going to be his new bosses and he wanted to follow those orders.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  We have the transcripts and they admit the news. Oh thank God he called all the Joint Chiefs and their adjuncts and said you will pledge allegiance to me and you will not follow Trump's orders.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  And he told Pelosi that as well. Pelosi says she spoke to General Millie about Trump and the nuclear codes and said the military won't let him do it.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  Oh my gosh go arrest Alex Jones. You know he might barbecue his children tonight but was I planning to barbecue my children? Did I say that? No.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  Trump was doing the opposite pulling us out of these wars. Lying ladies and gentlemen. He was using economic power to stand up to the Chicoms.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  So think about that. But the bigger picture isn't Millie. You've got Senator Paul saying it's treason. He must be removed plus the terrible job in Afghanistan.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  I was done by design to make peace look bad. And you've got Trump saying well if it's true, we'll play that clip next segment, if it's true he did this.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  He admitted Mr. President. Then he should be fired for treason. Well you don't get fired for treason. You get put in prison. And if it's real treason, you know what the books say.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  But let me show you something. This is 10 U.S. Code 152, Chairman, Appointment, Grade and Rank. And it says in Section C, C, Grade and Rank, the chairman while serving holds the grade of general in the case of the Navy admiral
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  or in the case of the officer of the Space Force, the equivalent grade. All outranks all other offices of the armed forces. However, he may not exercise military command over the Joint Chiefs of Staff or any of the armed forces.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  He has no command over armed forces because he might try to become a dictator like you saw with them killing Caesar. Setting up their own system again. And here it is. But that's just the law.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  Who needs that? I mean, Biden just signed an order saying everybody's bank accounts down to $600. Every transaction is watched. No Fourth Amendment. Just screw your country.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  And we're going to say it's an authorized vaccine. And when it's not even a vaccine and it's not been tested, but we secretly tested it, it's why we're not going to test it. You know, they're sitting around years ago.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  Our operation lockstep's got a problem. We try to roll this out. It's going to kill the animals and kill humans and human trials. We just don't do the trials. Well, you know how deadly it is. We'll do those in secret.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  We're under other vaccine program names, which they did.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  You know, you wonder why the communists would want to take over Russia and kill 30, 40 million of their own people because they wanted to kill people. They wanted power and control. Lenin said that. It's called the Red Terror.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  You wonder why Hitler would start a war with Russia. You know, didn't end too well for Napoleon and others. Why would you do that? The biggest landmass in the world with a bunch of tough people.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  More of them than you. Twice as many Russians. That's not a very smart fight to start. Because he wanted to kill people. He wanted blood. He wanted death.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  The journey was the destination. And we just keep wondering what's going on with these people. They're psychotic killers. Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Klaus Schwab, all right about how they want to depopulate 90% of people.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  And they're doing it. They told you they would and they're doing it. And they've groomed monsters like Millie. So here is the reason they want to stop here.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Because nine times out of 10 were the only ones that figure out the big picture because we do the most studying. Jack Pasobit was high level naval intelligence.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  Very jacked in. A great guy. He came out. He's saying all the same stuff because it's not his opinion. It's right here in CNN. It's right here in NBC News.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  From the time, the 6th, the 7th, the 8th, the 9th, the 10th, the 12th, they're all the news. Like, don't worry. We have control of the military. We had control.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  They throw away his executive orders. They don't listen to him. You know, if he tries to nuke stuff, we'll stop him.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  And now Bob Woodward puts a book out thinking it's going to make Trump look bad because maybe it, maybe in America is so stupid.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  They think like having someone call the Chinese and lie to him and say, because he knows the Chinese are spying on us. He knows the Chinese.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  Let me give you inside baseball. OK, if you understand how things work. You know why Millie got told by Schumer and Obama, you know, he talked to him and the rest of them.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  Well, I'll see you call it because the Chinese have got about 80% of Democrat people in their pockets. They're really double agents.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  They're screwing each other on both sides of them. The Dems and them. The Dems are globalist agents, but they are on the Chi Com payroll.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  They knew Millie knew the Chinese were getting chatter that Trump was planning to nuke China, not because Trump ever said that or did that.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  And the military has confirmed it and Trump's confirmed it. We know that and it fits into what he was doing, trying to have, you know, success through economics and through deals, not through war.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  Because they were going around telling members of Congress and the media and their staff, all of which have Chinese agents on them.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Check it out. Literally. It's come out in the news. Feinstein, all of them.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  And they told him, we may have to have a coup. We may have to kill Trump. We may have to remove him. We may have to do this because you saw in the news.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Oh, don't worry. The deep state's going to kill this guy or the intelligence agents have seven ways to Sunday to take him out.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  They had it all ready, but they needed a cover and it was going to be that he went crazy and ordered a nuclear attack and had the football in his hand and General Millie had to kill him.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  I'm telling you, these people would script something like that and Millie would be this is this hero.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  And that's what they were planning. That's how bad they are. They're not going to stab the president like Julius Caesar, you two Brutus.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  They're going to screw him over by setting him up and telling his enemies who might have even attacked and started a war.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  A lot of the globalists want to go ahead and have a war with China. They've been trying to entice a war for decades.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  Joel Scousen has exposed that. So it doesn't matter if it's Pelosi or Swallows, well, her nephew or whatever the hell he is.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  It's all the same thing. It's all the same sick crew. She's related to Newsom.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  It's all one sick crew of double dealing, backstabbing scum that fear the American people ever waking up, that fear the American people ever getting control of the government and bringing them to justice.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  So we're their natural enemy. And so it isn't about Millie. Sure, he needs to go to prison. It's about Pelosi. It's about Schumer.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  It's about the Clintons. It's about Obama. It's about the deep state coup that's in place already.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Trump was just there interrupting that and had a chance as a beachhead to take the island of DC back from the globalists.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  But he didn't do it because we didn't back him and Q told us he was invincible so people sat there with their thumbs up their ears.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  And that's what happened. And now you know. And now you know there's a military coup, a globalist coup over our country.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  And now they're killing us with chemical weapons and moving to bankrupt this and put in total AI control and finish the job they started declaring all Americans terrorists.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative. It hurts. It stinks. It's got pus coming out of it.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  I go to the doctor. They fix it. That's not negative. I'm not living in denial.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  That's actually a positive thing. And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job. They stole the election.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  We can't get down about that. We have forced them out in the open.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed. They're scared.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  That's why instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers. Look what happened. No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  They're trying to suppress us. Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts templewars.com.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  This headline is not a joke. This is America in September of 2020.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  T.C. Court sends man to jail for watching conspiracy theory videos online.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  Yes, it says the police did a spot check for quote compliance at his home and found him in his garage
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  watching rumble social media site, which they say is a conspiracy site.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  Also, he admitted to watching Mike Lindell's three day cyber symposium.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  Yes, it was part of the conditions of his bail. The judge said he could not look at any videos questioning the election.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  No joke. And so they sent the stars into his house and caught him doing it.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  So now he's going into solitary confinement. Communism has come to America. The Republic has fallen.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  And as crazier things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  Thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars. God bless.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  We're serious about getting the B-12 they need to fight deficiency and reach their peak.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  The results are simple. Ultra-12 can help make DNA, help the body produce energy and blood cells,
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  and support healthy nerve and brain cells.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  Now you can finally upgrade your daily routine.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  Get Ultra-12 today to support the InfoWars store and experience true B-12 power.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  I want to be completely clear with our amazing listeners all across the United States and all across this amazing planet.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  I don't come up here and say these terrible things to scare you or to shock you or to try to make you give up.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  I believe you're like me. I believe when faced with these real attacks, I believe when you're faced with this great evil,
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  you're going to stop submitting to the system, you're going to build your own system,
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  you're going to find others that think the way you do, and we're going to do like our ancestors did over and over again,
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  build a remnant or redoubts against this.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  But we're going to have to come out of the system, forget going to their concerts, forget going to their movies.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  It's already collapsing anyways. It's all a manipulation to make you take their mark, take their injection, take over your body,
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  destroy your immune system and slowly kill you.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  Predators are making their move. First, they dumbed us down, then they made us weak, now they're coming after us.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  And they put people in like the Secretary of State who lies.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  I mean, this morning, I went and reviewed five or six clips. We'll play it next segment of Biden having his mic turned off
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  and them saying, all right, return the mic off. All right, they turn it off.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  And now when he says something embarrassing, they turn it off, they cut the feed, they've admitted they do it before,
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  Biden's admitted it before. And then there's the Secretary of State lying to a U.S. senator saying, that's ridiculous.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  We don't do it.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  And it's just like the Democrats all at 9-11 this weekend, they're back in the parking lot area about to be let it in,
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  the private parking lot area. None of them are wearing masks. They're all laughing. They're all joking.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  Then they put their mask on and go through the back onto the stage. It's theater.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  And just like suspended disbelief, when you're younger, you can go to a movie, you see it and five minutes in,
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  I would be in a trance. It would be so real and so incredible.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  But once I got to be a video editor and a writer and a researcher by my 20s, I can't go into suspended disbelief ever.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  I look at the camera angles, I look at the lighting, I think about who wrote it. I'm interested in the credits.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  The films are still fascinating, but it's from a perspective of a social engineer.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I'm not using social engineer techniques. I know what's going on.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  And you talk to a leftist particularly, they're five to six times more likely to be mentally ill,
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  six to nine times more likely to steal, six to eight times more likely to virtue signal, but not give to charity,
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  in their own statistics, their own universities, do studies. And that to them is good.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  They also have arrested development. That's why they give all over the world, college students that are upset,
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  Play-Doh and little foot tall tables where they get sit down with coloring books.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  And they're rewarded by the professors and others with high grades for sucking their thumbs.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  These are people living in a delusion.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  And then you've got their controllers who are lying to us by design.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  So here it is, 10 U.S. Code 152 Chairman Appointment.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  He may not command U.S. forces. He may not exercise military command over anyone,
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  including the Joint Chiefs of Staff or any armed forces,
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  because you don't want the chairman, the advisor to the president, to think he's the president.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Well, that old thing that's happened in history thousands of times,
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  you know about hundreds of famous cases, don't you? It just happened again.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  And you know what? They removed the president, they stole the election, and they're in charge now.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  And did they reconcile? Did they say, let's be friendly, let's come together?
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  Their puppet, Biden, did. Like a saving private Ryan where the German soldier says,
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  oh, let's be friends. And as soon as he pulls the dagger away, the German stabs him.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  It's the same thing. Oh, Biden, let's all be friends, let's come together.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  Meanwhile, all his surrogates. The gun owners are terrorists. Those that question the election are terrorists.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  Those that don't law lockdown are terrorists. They're the main threat.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  They're secretly working with a Taliban. They're going to, well, it's them working with a Taliban.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  They're going to kill everybody. We got to go to war with the American people.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  That's the new National Threat Assessment from June.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  The first week of the press conference, it was, we're going to have a CIA and FBI go after the American people.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  They're the terrorists. I said, oh, they're going to put it in the National Threat Directive.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  They're going to make it the main threat, and they did it because they're a foreign group of criminals,
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  not Chinese agents. Oh, they take money from that.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  They're like a whore that'll take money from whoever gives it to them.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Really, they're like a pimp. I guess they whore us out, then they take the money.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  And all they care about is their power and their control.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  So they come to them, the big banks come to them, and they go, well, the U.S. has one of the oldest populations in the world.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Let's give them a shot that gives them Alzheimer's Neurological Disorder and will shorten their life by 10 years.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  If they take it when they're, say, 60, that way you don't have to pay out the retirement, as if all that fiat means anything.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  They go, absolutely, we've got a, there's too many people and the planet's reached its carrying capacity,
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  and the world as we know it has to end by 2030 if we're going to save the planet.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  That's the official U.N. Biological Diversity Assessment.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  But Beto, O'Rourke and AOC have all been briefed on, so they kind of come out in their own way.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Just little morons that are front people and say, oh, the world ends in 12 years.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  That was two years ago. 2030, we've got to just cut resources.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  And it's all just this vague cosmology they follow.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  Because the average person going along with this at a level of management, even if it's low or high,
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  they just want an excuse to believe being greedy and hateful is good.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  Like the photos that I saw, not just of her wearing the designer dress,
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  $10,000 in the expensive jewelry and the expense of everything,
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  saying being wealthy is bad, no, being corrupted wealthy is bad,
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  stealing and becoming wealthy is bad, being a globalist being wealthy is bad,
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  shutting down all your competition and becoming filthy rich is bad.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  But it was photos of her and others in their gowns with all the servants wearing masks, but they don't.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  It's a total class thing. It's a sign of being in the slave class.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  But let's play a clip of Trump saying, if it's true, because he's smart enough to believe Bob Woodward,
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  well, it's funny if he had real advisors, Trump would know it's true.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  They bragged about it back on January 8th, how they'd already taken the military way before they ever stole the election from him
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  and make sure they could steal it. They had the media, they had big tech, they had the censorship,
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  they even took his Twitter away, and then they'd blame him for what, have a nuclear war,
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  when they were the ones almost starting it, calling up and lying about it. Here's President Trump.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  So first of all, if it is actually true, which is hard to believe, that he would have called China
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  and done these things and was willing to advise them of an attack or in advance of an attack,
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  that's treason. And I would think, I've had so many calls today saying, that's treason.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Number one, number two, it's totally ridiculous. I never thought of it.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  You were there. You would do what was happening in the White House. You have plenty of friends.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  You never heard the word China mentioned in a thing like this.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  You heard a lot of anger about China on trade, and we made a great trade deal.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  You heard a lot of anger on China with the China virus.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  But for him to say, for him to say, that I would even think about attacking China,
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  I think he's trying to just get out of his incompetent withdrawal out of Afghanistan.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  The worst, the dumbest thing that anybody's seen, probably the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to our country,
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  where they killed our soldiers.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  That's enough.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  See, see, Trump goes to like, this guy's an opportunist. He just made this up in a book.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  No, they were prepared to kill you. They were prepared to remove you.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  They bragged about it with Pelosi, with Schumer.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  They set it all up and had the military secretly pledge allegiance to Milley.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  That's illegal, Trump, and your advisors won't tell you that.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  They'll go, yeah, he's in so much trouble, sir, over Afghanistan.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  They just did this to change the subject.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  No, they did this to rub it in on you and say you tried to have a nuclear war when you were trying to bring peace.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  And they're pissed about Afghanistan, so they wrecked that deal.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  That's what they did, and Trump has all the ammo, but Trump has good instincts, but he doesn't do the research.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  He knows about golf and his lobster tails and his steak, and that he likes America.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  He doesn't like people screwing us over in business deals.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  But it's bigger than just, he thought the elite would want to make more money and be more powerful, have America on top.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  Why are you having China on top? We should be on top.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  They go, yes, sir, you're right, while they stab him in the back, because it's a spiritual thing.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  At the end of the day, they do bad. They hate America. They want to defeat it.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  They want to suck it dry. They want to destroy it.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  Close, he threatens the president. One way or another, we will remove Trump.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  She said the military will drag him out.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  That was in October, before November. They had it all set up.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  But as usual, is Rand Paul getting it? Is Trump getting it? Is all the other...
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Chuck Carlson gets a lot of it, and he's about the best there is.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  We just sit here, not getting it, not knowing what really happened.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  The coup won. The coup is in place. It's a globalist run. It's illegitimate.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  It's poisoning us. It's setting up a world ID card.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  We need governors and state legislatures and senators to stand up and defeat it.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  And America would rally behind that.
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  If you think the puppet president, Joe Biden, coming out and announcing that 100 million Americans
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  are going to be forced to take experimental shots or lose their jobs,
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  understand we know the blueprint of the UN. They've stated their plan.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  Contact tracers coming to your house, 10 forced injections a year,
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  the destruction of your immune system, the depopulation of the planet,
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  and the vaccine passport on your, quote, iPhone or droid,
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  tracking and tracing everything you do,
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  and telling you when you can go outside of your house or where you can go,
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  not just for COVID-19, but for carbon taxes.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  So as I've said a thousand times, submission is death.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  You give into this just for your job or to be able to go to the bar
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  or to be able to, quote, fly an airplane.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  Then they're going to slowly put the screws in with these apps on your phone
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  to control where you go and what you do and dog train you right into total slavery.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  This is criminal. It's illegal. It's tyranny. And we must resist and not comply.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  In late August, in full war saw an explosion of orders
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of,
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  right along with water filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  Now we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.

[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro,
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  Visit thebiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  That's thebiopros.com.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  Thebiopros.com.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  Finally, Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K that are both essential
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  are getting the respect and the attention they deserve.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  We've got a great product.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  It's been out for six years.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  Winter sun.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  Long before the big crisis came along, we were there saying,
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  this is high quality, this will make you healthy,
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  this will be better for you and your family.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  But what else doesn't get attention and needs to be looked at is Vitamin B12.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  It is just as essential.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  It is just as important and it is amazing.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  And it's not just about your immune system.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  It's about every part of your body.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  It's really a hormone and it's what your building blocks of your entire body operate off of.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  So these vitamins are essential.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  Vitamin D3 and, of course, Vitamin B12 go together like a horse and carriage.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  Do your own research.
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  We've got the highest grades you're going to find out there and they're taken under the tongue.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  It's key to put it under the tongue for about a minute and let it sit so your blood vessels absorb it.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  They're both available 50% off at infowarsstore.com together or by themselves at 50% off and 25% off.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  That's right.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Evil comes and evil goes.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  Love your children, love your wives, your husbands, your family.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  Take care of each other.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  And don't let them put this deadly injection.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  You see, they want to get everybody injected so everybody gets sick and they can claim it's another virus later.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  If you have a control group of hundreds of millions of people that's not injected that isn't sick and they didn't have the heart attacks and the cancers, you've got a big problem.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  They've really committed to a criminal takeover and imagine what they've got up their sleeve next and they've already done something this bold.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  So here's the bottom line.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  Joe Biden is a complete puppet.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  They knew they were planning to steal the election.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  They wanted a puppet they could control.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  They want this international bureaucracy in the UN to be in charge.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  They want to discredit America in the process.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  So they want an embarrassing week president in there to undermine the office further.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  And they are now making their move against our republic and mopping up the final governors and senators and House members and legislators and other leaders that oppose them.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  And they are in an operation of trying to put governors and legislators and talk show host everybody else in prison, trying to bankrupt us, trying to sue us.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  They sue you in jurisdictions where they own the judges, where they don't even want to try to make a deal with you to get money in these suits.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  They tell you, no, we just want to get in and shut your company down, which with the right judges, they can just do bypass and come in and do it.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  And so you have to understand that's the war going on.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  I see it from the real level.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  I see us losing the war.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  I see us waking people up.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  Of course, they recalled Governor Newsom.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  They stole that.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  We have all the evidence.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Of course, Trump wanted a landslide.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  But we've got criminals that took over and are blocking that.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  And so they're moving through the judiciary and the legislatures and every other level of the people they control and Soros buying off the prosecutors and installing the prosecutors to finish their takeover of this country.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  And so it's a very, very dangerous moment.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  You know, I was reminded when I saw a clip last night of Senator questioning Biden and asking him about or questioning Biden's Secretary of State and saying, you know, who's in control?
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  Who is in charge?
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  Because Biden obviously doesn't know who he is at the time.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  Video, Senator Manson know who cuts off Biden's mic.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  We need to know who is in charge.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  This is a puppeteer act, said Senator Reich.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  And the Secretary of State looks right at him in the most bald-faced way I've ever seen.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  And we'll just see if yourself here it is.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  I've seen this. We saw it as recently as yesterday. Somebody in the White House has authority to press the button and stop the President, cut off the President's speaking ability and sound.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  Who is that person?
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  I think anyone who knows the President, including members of this committee, knows that he speaks very clearly and very deliberately for himself.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  No one else does.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Are you saying that there is no one in the White House that can cut him off?
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  Because yesterday that happened and it's happened a number of times before that.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  It's been widely reported that somebody has the ability to push the button and cut off his sound and stop him from speaking.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Who is that person?
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  There is no such person.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  And again, the President speaks for himself, makes all of the strategic decisions informed by the best advice that he can get from the people around him.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  So are you unaware that this is actually happening?
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  Because it happened yesterday at the Interagency Fire Center.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  It was widely reported. The media's reported on it.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  And it's not the first time it's happened. It's happened several times.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  Are you telling this committee that this does not happen, that there's no one in the White House who pushes the button and cuts him off in mid-sentence?
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  That's correct.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  So this didn't happen yesterday nor on the other occasions where the media showed the American people that his sentence was cut off in mid-sentence.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  Are you saying that didn't happen?
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  Senator, I really don't know what you're referring to.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Look at the arrogance of your TV viewer. You can see the Secretary of State sitting there.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  And none one of the Chinese laugh at him and threaten to nuke him and say shut up to him when they never treated Trump like that or anybody else.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  Because these guys don't respect their own government, their own country, their own elected President Trump.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  And the world doesn't see that as strong.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  They see that as America run by out-of-control bureaucracies who are all fighting with each other over power and control.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  This means we're extremely weak.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  And I don't say that with enjoyment. I have four children. I live here. I have a lot of pride in America.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  It's been an exceptional country in its history, the most exceptional.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  People came here because they had a higher standard of freedom compared to other nations.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  But with great power comes great decadence, and we really have fallen.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  All right, we have Andrew Torba, who has one of the biggest independent sites out there, to break down the incredible censorship and attacks,
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  but also exciting things that are going on in just the state of the world.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  He's going to join us for 30 minutes, and then I'm going to continue with a ton of news on other subjects I haven't hit.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  We could also open the phones up.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  I may just come up here tonight and do like a two, three hour special show and just take calls.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  Regardless, I'm going to start doing some of that. We're hiring extra crews when I get that done because these are the times I need to be on air six, seven, eight hours.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  A lot of folks can't call in during the day, and I like to do a commercial free show or pretty close to commercial free.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  That's just for the Internet, just for a podcast. People request it. They really like it.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  I do the Saturday podcast most Saturdays. I did five and a half hours Saturday and crew did a great job.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  And that's what I want to do. This is historic time, and I'll just say this right now.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  I am working no exaggeration, 15, 16 hours a day. Hell, probably more than that. It's pretty ridiculous.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  But that's because I know how serious history is, and I can't strategically get into all of the things that we're up to and the things we're doing.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  But I'll tell you this, if you want to see us on air in a year and you want to see victory against the globalists, if you want to see us fight this thing out as hard as we can to the end,
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  you've got to feed an attack dog, and you've got to keep it in shape, and you've got to walk it, and you've got to keep it in position.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  And when it gets torn up, you've got to sew it up. Now, I want to fight. Believe me, that's all I want to do.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  I know who these people are. I am completely driven and turned over to this town.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  I'm hitting another level of focus, and sometimes I get a little out of control because of it, because the focus gets so pure.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  And then when I get off of that, I want to go back there. I've never had focus like this one. I've got it.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  And determination and commitment and your prayers, I can feel them. So three things I'm going to ask for.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  I need you to pray for me and my family and this operation of this crew and pray that I'll be steadfast and be in the high place of the most high,
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  quiet place of the most high that King David talked about.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  That the spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, flowed through me cleanly and that my flesh be washed away.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  I want to be a pure vessel against the enemy. I'll never be totally pure, but your prayers will have an effect, and I need to pray that as well.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  I need to be a pure vessel for this, and I'm far from it.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  And I also need you to financially support us and spread the word like your lives depend on it because it does.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  This is damn real. People used to ask, how has he come off so convincing that this is crazy? He's a madman.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  Yes, I know to read Bill Gates talking about how he wants to kill you and your family. It sounds crazy, but it's real.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  I know the Georgia's guide stones sound crazy. They're real.
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  So I need funds, ladies and gentlemen, to fight the war at every level.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  We have to have our own infrastructure, our own backup, our own systems. We have to have it all.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  And I need to be able to do this, and I need to have the money to do it and not just have enough money to operate.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  I need to expand directly in their face, and I'm not going to tell you moves before I make them, but I need money.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  So we've got vitamins and supplements and t-shirts and books and films and water filters and air filters and all.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  People go, man, you're air filter and water filters like in the top two or three rated out of hundreds,
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  and it's half the price of ones that aren't as good. Yeah, because we want to find the very best product.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  We don't have the philosophy of overcharging for something that doesn't work.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  It's all there. Air filters or water filters are all top of the line for very low prices.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  Storable food, same deal. Infowarstore.com. And we got a bunch of things back in stock.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  Winter sun, high quality D3, the number one thing for your immune system.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  Adults, children, old folks, especially folks with dark skin, you know, sort of much sun, as you know.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  Ultra 12, take it out of the tongue. Again, goddess immune system, stamina, libido, energy, everything.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  We have a super concentrated liquid turmeric formula that is excellent.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  It's almost as strong as bodies, but it's another formula.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  It's curcuminoids are very, very high, but I mean, nobody's got something at 97% or whatever the hell it is.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  It's curcuminoid like bodies, which we can't get the highest grades, which has been shut down and it's not here for six months or whatever.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  So infowarstore.com, get your products and know you are funding the absolute resistance to tyranny at point blank range.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  Take action now. I'm trying to, again, do as best I can this fight and I need your prayers.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  I need your financial support and I need you, which I see a lot of folks doing to take clips of the show.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  Put it on Facebook, put it on Instagram, put it on YouTube.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  Don't put my name on it or the bots find it.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  And it's hitting and then it gets millions of views and they take it down.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  It's like whack-a-mole, but it's okay because we're winning.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  And info wars is having the biggest effect out there next to Tucker Carlson.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  And that is a wonderful, wonderful thing.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  I hope it gets a thousand times bigger and we win.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  I'm not in competition with Tucker, but he's the best thing we've got next to this operation.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  So infowarstore.com or triple a two five three three one three nine.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  I do not have funding, but through you, plus you need all these products.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  You should stock up on them now.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  A lot of other products we'll have time to get into.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  They're all available at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  We're going to run the sale for at least one more week, 50% off.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  On September 9th, 2021, the public president Joe Biden publicly declared war against America.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  He then announced dictatorial powers on himself and announced forced inoculations against the American people.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  He is a puppet of the United Nations and the Rockefeller combined of corporations that put him in power
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  and he is making a very serious move against the American people.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  But the attack he's launched is being launched against every other western country on the planet
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  by these corporations that have already enslaved the third world.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  What they're doing is illegal on its face, violates our federal and state laws and the Geneva Convention as well as the Nuremberg Code.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  It's very, very simple.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  We have to decide whether we're going to surrender to this globalist corporate takeover,
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  whether we're going to stand up with our birthright and say no,
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  and then prosecute these criminals for their crimes against humanity so other criminals in the future don't dare try it.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  The choice is up to us.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:53.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  But we failed.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, great reset.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waves.
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health prices.
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  They are nothing but distractions. You know, I can assure you we have so much to do to protect the health and the welfare of the American people
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  that I would just hope we just put those conspiracy stuff and let somebody write a book about it later on, but not now.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  The problem is you got some people out there who are fanning these conspiracy claims from the planet Pluto.
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  And it's just disgusting what they're trying to say of all these crazy, deep state malarkey.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  Well, later on when the records were made public, it was not a conspiracy theory from the planet of Pluto, actually.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  There were inflated deaths. They were even taking gunshot wounds and categorizing them as COVID deaths.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  You're saying there is a massive pressure to artificially inflate the number of COVID-19 cases.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  Yeah, I have directly been told to, if a patient has fever and cough or anything similar, to put this COVID-like diagnosis on the chart.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  One of the big things the corporate media does to deceive the public is say, oh, there's all these crazies that don't believe a virus even exists.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  And they're saying nobody's dying. That's not what we're saying.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  COVID-19 is the greatest fraud ever pushed on mankind. It is not about a virus.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  I believe this is a psychological war upon society.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  What are the history books going to say about you? Did you stand up for common sense and critical thinking?
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  I think the answer is clear what I'm going to be doing. What are you going to be doing?
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Secure your copy of COVIDland at covidland.com and start fighting back against the globalist lies.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  Wednesday, September 15, 2021 is a special day for M4s. It's also going to be an important day for the globalist because it's the day that we start pre-sales on a new film.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  The first film M4s is released in more than nine years.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  COVIDland exposes the globalist great reset corporate power grab and goes over every facet of how they launch the fraud and how they're using it to take control of our society in their own words.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  This is the medicine to the globalist tyranny. This is the antidote to their new world order takeover.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  And it's only part one in a five part series that is going to be released within the next six months.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  Every month and a half or so, a new part of the series will be released and the first part is incredibly powerful.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  You can secure yours now in the pre-order that's going to go for three weeks at infowarstore.com or simply go to covidland.com.

[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  So you have a copy for yourself, a copy to give others and a copy of in-game that predicted all of this again from the globalist own words.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  But on top of that, not just in-game, but also COVIDland has a zero country code meaning it works anywhere in the world.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  And you're authorized for educational purposes to make copies of COVIDland and of course in-game as well.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  So you can give it to your friends, family, neighbors, aired on access TV, aired on local TV. I don't care.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  It's free to air. We want this information to get out to the world.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  So take action now, expose the globalist plan and we can stop these tyrants together. Secure your copy of COVIDland part one today exclusively at infowarstore.com and it starts shipping in three weeks from September 15th, 2021.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  We will shut you down. We will cite you. And if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  The time for educating people into compliance is over. We're watching you and we are going to take decisive action.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  If you are not in a central business, I'm using my power as governor under emergency declaration to order you to close.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  New lockdowns are coming is a documentary series about the global deception known as the COVID-19 pandemic with key interviews from scientists, doctors, nurses, authors and subject matter experts.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  We untangle the lies about the lockdowns, the face mask and the so-called COVID.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  This is a full trailer at Band-Aid video. Stay with us.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  I think they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's going to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  Okay, now it's just climate change. But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  They have weather control trees from 1979. Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  In 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  Well, I talk a lot about it on air, but it's got a name and it's parallel societies, parallel civilization.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  What did Europeans do when they were tired of not having religious freedom and being burned at the stake if they were Protestants or whatever?
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  They left Holland, they left the Netherlands, they left England, they left Scotland, Ireland, they came to the United States.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  It doesn't mean they didn't set up some of the same oppression they left. That's the way it works. But that's why we're always running from the establishment and then we end up becoming it.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  That's really the paradox, but we need that rebirth. And people come from all over the world, whether it's Africa or Latin America or Asia, to escape the kingpins, the monopolies, the gangs that run their societies.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  Now we have a global government, a technocracy that spies on us and that ran a coup against Trump to remove him from office, claiming he wanted to use nuclear weapons when he didn't, to have the military already ready to take him out.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  It's Pelosi bragged and bragged she met and talked to Millie. That's all in the news, these claims. She bragged back of the time, oh, the military will remove him.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  Then she had him all parade out there and she walked in front of the troops at the Capitol in that fascist symbol of bringing the troops into the Capitol showing her power.
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  Not since Julius Caesar have we seen that at a republic like this.
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  So, Andrew Torba, I usually try to get him on, he's a very busy guy and he's usually like, hey, you're doing great, but I can't come on right now, I'm watching so much stuff.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  But he called me this weekend and he said, I got something really exciting to talk about and exciting things to gab.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  I said, absolutely, we've got to codify this. We've got to define this. We've got to move to do this because there's two tracks, really.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  Try to defeat the globalist, take our countries back, but that's looking really bad right now, isn't it, because they control all the regulators and law enforcement at the federal level.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  Or just withdraw from the system and start doing what they want. They want to bully us out of their big stores. They want to bully us off their systems.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  Let's start our own airline. There's a lot of folks that money can do that. If we get popular right away, they buy more planes. That's how innovation works.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  Let's start our own social media network like Mr. Torbott's done. So that's what he's getting at. I appreciate him from gab.com to center.com.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  Andrew Torbott joining us, left Silicon Valley in November 2016, started his site. They've attacked and now it is one of the only two or three successful sites out there that actually isn't censoring people.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  And it's like the internet was just four or five years ago, somewhat free. So Andrew, thanks for joining us.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  Thanks for having me, Alex. You know, it's been an interesting month. We had the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, even Congress come after gab.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  After I had, you know, thousands of people reaching out and saying, you know, my workplace, the military, you know, all these different places are forcing these vaccines are mandating these vaccines.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  What can we do? So I, you know, pulled together the resources that we have on gab from people over the world, and we came up with a bunch of different templates to provide people with religious exemption templates that they could use,
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  whether they're Catholic or Protestant or Orthodox, to hopefully, you know, thwart these these mandates.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  And, you know, the machine, the deep state machine did not like that. So they started coming after gab really hard.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  And I started to, you know, think about this concept more. I've been talking about building a parallel economy, building a parallel internet.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  And now I'm, you know, coming to the conclusion that really we have to build a parallel society.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  So what does that really look like? It looks like, you know, maybe you're going to have to pull your kids out of school.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  Maybe you're going to have to get a new job. Maybe you're going to have to move somewhere else.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  It's going to be hard, but really I see us as being the modern day pilgrims. Was it difficult for the pilgrims to up and leave and come to a new land and start fresh and start building something new?
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  Of course. Was it difficult for, you know, first century Christians to spread the gospel, you know, among hostile territories? Absolutely.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  But, you know, look what we got because of that. We got the greatest country on the face of the earth because of what the pilgrims did because of the courage that they had.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  And I think that we could do something similar now if they don't want us to participate in their system, if they want us to inject ourselves with these vaccines.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  And by the way, the most interesting trend that I'm seeing now is people who did get the first vaccination and are now being, you know, questioning it.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  They're saying, wait a minute, I thought I was fully vaccinated and now I'm going to have to be getting these booster shots and these twice daily pills and all this stuff.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  So, you know, a lot of the people that have already been vaccinated are starting to wake up as well because, you know, in a few weeks, maybe in a few months, they'll be considered unvaccinated as well if they don't have the booster shots.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  So it's not just people who have refused outright refused the vaccination. It's people who also got the first dose of vaccination and now are saying, wait a minute, I'm not getting any more of these shots.
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  This is ridiculous. I was I was sold a bill of goods and I was lied to and told that if I just got this this one shot or this this these two shots that I'd be OK.
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  I'd be able to go back to normal. And, you know, what we're quickly finding out is things are not going back to normal.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  And this is indefinite medical tyranny. So there's a lot of people waking up and a lot of people are exiting the system.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  They're pulling their kids out of school. They're leaving their jobs. They're moving to different states that are more friendly to freedom.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  So, you know, this is this concept of a parallel society where, you know, the system and the state, they want us to fight back.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  They want us to get violent. They want us to, you know, try to attack them or, you know, try to frame things in that way.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  That is not what we should do. What we should do is withdraw from their systems completely, turn off the TV, pull your kids out of school, move to a different state.
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  And notice, you know, they know that's the power. They want a war. They say we're going to get violent. They keep pushing.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  Paul Schwab says he wants to create a collapse all over the world and civil war by cutting resources off like we're too dumb to know that.
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  The answer is pull out of their system, put our resources together. And just like the Jews, 3,000 years ago, leave Egypt, Exodus.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  And we may have to wander around for a while, but that's just the way it is.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  Exactly. Absolutely. I mean, what we need to do is we need to remain peaceful. We're builders, Alex.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  You know, we're critical thinkers. We're doers. We're builders. That is what people like us have always done throughout all of history.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  And it's time. We're at a critical point in history right now where we need to do that again.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  So, you know, we need to embrace the change. We need to embrace the ability for our, you know, that God gave us to build and to, you know, create a new parallel society where we have our own social networks.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  We have our own version of the Internet.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  And by the way, you kind of look like Miles Standish here and you've already started. So this is a virtual Exodus you're doing. You're kind of the Miles Standish 2.0 here.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  Sure. Sure. That's that's fine. I mean, this is not a new concept. It's been done many times before, but I believe that we're again at a point in time in history where it needs to be done right now.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  And really, they've left us no choice, right? So, you know, you see that, you know, they're they're mandating these vaccines and I'm having a lot of people that are telling me that the religious exemption is working.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  But then I'm having also a lot of people telling me that it's not working and they're they're not accepting even though they're claiming that they're accepting religious exemptions.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  They're not they're not allowing it. So those folks are, you know, looking to start their own businesses. I have I've seen doctors that are saying I'm leaving my hospital and starting my own private practice.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  You know, these things are happening. People are leaving the system and they are building and what's going to be left in the system is these these yes men who will go out and get the 15th booster shot in order to keep their job.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  And my heart goes out to these people. But, you know, really what what the existing system is going to be left with is a lot of incompetent sheep.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  And, you know, with that type of, you know, workforce and that type of quote unquote talent in the system that the existing system is inevitably going to collapse.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  It'll chug along for a little bit. But all the smart, most talented people are going to be building this parallel society and building alternative new businesses that aren't going to pry into your health care privacy.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  That aren't going to force you to get this vaccine that aren't going to go along with the mask mandates and all this stuff anymore.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  Those are the businesses that are going to thrive. And, you know, with free market forces, inevitably those businesses are going to come up on top.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  And this this new society, this parallel society that we're building is going to become the dominant society. It's going to take a little bit.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  But we can't do it. We just have to start building. We have to start exiting the system. You know, delete your Facebook account.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  Stop watching the mainstream news networks. Pull your kids out of school where they're being indoctrinated and told their evil because of their skin color and because of their political opinions.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  And they're being told to wear masks for 10 hours a day. We have to stop this madness. We have to say enough is enough.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  Enough of us need to say enough is enough. And I think we're at that point in history where we just have to start building and we have to say, I'm done with the system.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  We're going to go our own way. We're going to move to states that, you know, embrace freedom and defend freedom.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  We're going to move to areas where we're around people who support our values and we're going to support businesses and help build businesses that support our values.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  And Andrew, let's expand on that. We're not the one holding the globalist hostage. They took over. They hijacked. They bought up the corporations.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  They bought off the government. They're trying to get us into a thing with gene therapy that destroys our immune systems and makes us really sick.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  They're taking over. They're making us dependent. They're putting us into bondage.
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  And so we should pull out and not comply with their system. It's totally illegitimate. It's not just our right. It's our duty.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  And as you said, massive numbers of the people that took the first injections are pissed now because they got told two shots.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  You're totally taking out three. It's four. It's five. Oh, it's 10 a year. And now there's pills you got to take in an app to leave your house.
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  This is such a dystopia and people need to wake up and say no before they're totally in a prison.
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  And then it's too late to get out of it. Andrew Torbott, when we come back, I want to talk more about parallel civilization, parallel society,
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  because the globalists are actually building their parallel society while they wreck ours.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  What they're saying is let's pull out of their control demolition and save and rebuild what we can, but based on American values.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  Now, which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support?
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  Immune10x. In the best part, you can go to the StrongerDefense website right now and claim your own supply of Immune10x without paying anything today.

[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds,
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  both the regular shows and special reports, and share them with everyone you know.

[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts. Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  No, it wasn't. That was all bad enough. It's the fact that he's following a UN globalist great recent blueprint that Australia, the UK, Europe, and the rest of the western world is, and that this is just the beginning.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  More lockdowns, national medical IDs approved by the United Nations, carbon taxes that don't just track and trace you, attacks you, but actually tell you when you can go somewhere and what you can do.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  It's all been announced at the UN level. This is a UN world government takeover, corporate revolution through global governance. It's illegal and Congress must stand up and stop it now.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  We are back with Andrew Torba of gab.com, and he laughed when I said you're like Miles Standish that led the first pilgrim expedition here to the United States.
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  They had a few other expeditions like Jamestown that they'd all been found basically killed and eaten by the natives, but this was the first successful mission.
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  And what he is doing is trailblazing. And info wars is trailblazing. When listeners support the broadcast is trailblazing. When you go to gab and visit our pages or Andrews and share the links, those places are getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  That's why they had the Republican Party of Texas wanting gab shut down, just as it's like Facebook five years ago and as long as you're not calling for murder or selling drugs, you can do it.
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  Doesn't mean we agree with saying white people are inherently bad or black people are inherently bad, but there's a few people on there doing that. Hell, Democrats do it on national TV.
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  But then they go, oh, you know, gab needs to be brought down because they have speech. Info wars needs to be brought down. It's so horrible.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  All the New York Times lies about WMDs on purpose. So that's what's happening. It's a revolutionary act to get involved in this mental exodus, spiritual exodus from the globalist.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  I never really liked Hollywood. Now I hate it. I never really liked Facebook. Now I hate it. And I only use those things and those venues to get the word out about what we're doing, but I don't marvel at it.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  I don't like it. I don't want acceptance by it. Look at a Hollywood Starwalk. They're all a bunch of crazy hypocrites, a bunch of frauds.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  You're talking about a parallel society, Andrew. The globalists own their own private islands, their own castles, their own fortresses, their own 300,000 acre ranches that Bill Gates and people like Ted Turner have.
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  But they say we should live in 200 square foot coffin apartments. So they're already breaking away from us so they can carry out their operation.
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  That's why it's important for us to basically pull out everywhere from their systems, though we're going to be in the world, not of their globalist world. Does that make sense?
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  Absolutely. Absolutely, Alex. Ultimately, it comes down to, you know, what is your freedom worth to you? To me, it's worth everything, right?
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  So I want the freedom to worship in my church without permission from the state. I want the freedom to work without being forced to inject myself with a substance that I don't want in my body.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  I want the freedom to have a political opinion on the Internet without being banned from banks and social networks.
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  I want the freedom for my children to learn without having, you know, this disgusting and unhealthy dirty mask over their face for eight hours a day and being told that they're evil for their skin color.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  Now, are these freedoms worth making an effort to preserve and protect? I believe that they are. And it's time to start acting like it, right?
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  Like, we have to start doing something. They want us to get violent. That is not the approach that we need to take because they will crush us and they would have no other way.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  They would love to be able to have an excuse to annihilate us, right? That's what they want. So we cannot give into that.
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  That's why they provocateur January 6. And now we know Millie and all them were heavily involved.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  They were trying to have a coup against Trump. They planned it on being way more violent using their coup operatives to manipulate the small number of folks that did go in.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  They want any excuse to destroy us, any excuse to shut us up, any excuse to ostracize us from society. And we're seeing that happen and unfold before our eyes.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  If they want to ostracize us from their society, fine. We will up and leave and we will build our own new society that is grounded in Christian American values that have been at the forefront, at the ground, at the core of this country for hundreds of years.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  And we have tens of millions of people on our side and more and more people are waking up every single day. Again, like I said, it's not just the quote unquote unvaccinated, which they claim it's 80 million people.
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  It's probably even more. Those numbers are probably bogus, but it's also the people that got one or two shots that are saying, wait a minute, I was told that if I got this, things would go back to normal.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  We look at Israel where they're on, you know, shot number four, I think it is, their COVID cases are exploding. They're the most vaccinated country in the world. So clearly the vaccinations are not the solution here.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  It's all about control. It's about eliminating and pushing and ostracizing as much of us as many of us.
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  It's about divide and conquer. Let me ask you about this. I saw this pushed on Facebook to me everywhere, seeing a local TV station. We know those are the ones like the fake Ivermectin story poisoning. Everybody they use locals because they're more, more quote, you know, believable to the average people.
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  Now we know Facebook and others were partnering with them and it said, tell us about your loved ones that got sick or died because they didn't have the vaccine. No one responded out of 36,000 people basically.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  Everybody else said, my dad had a heart attack, my sister died, my 12 year old son just died or 13 year old. It was a nightmare of just absolute hell on earth of what happened to the people.
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  Again, as of with this article I read this morning, 30 plus thousand respondents, 99% negative to WXYZ TV channel. And folks, that's a real TV channel. Channel seven, that's the level of people begging to have some place to tell about the hell they're discovering.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  What are you seeing as reports on GAB because I'm seeing funerals all over Austin of teenage boys and girls dying of heart attacks ever they take this.
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  Yep, we're we're seeing this all over GAB. These people they're trying to share their story on the big social networks and they're getting censored.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  They're getting banned and they're coming to GAB to share their story where of course they're met with open arms from from our community.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  And these stories are just heartbreaking. We're seeing a lot of young men who are having heart attacks, heart problems from this thing. There's risks that are just not being discussed.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  We have no long term studies. They just want to force as many of us to take this vaccine as possible for a virus that the vast majority of the population has a 99% chance of surviving.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  So, you know, we have to understand that we have to give these people a voice and we have to weigh the risk of, you know, injecting this stuff into our bodies when we have no long term consequences, no long term studies that we understand right now.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  And we're seeing these people flood on GAB that are sharing these stories like this. And I did see this one on Facebook. I'm actually surprised it didn't get removed yet.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  It probably has at this point. But yeah, they asked for, you know, stories of people that, you know, had family members that had died or had problems with COVID and every single comment was no.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  Actually, I had a family member that died or had severe problems or complications because of the vaccine and we're seeing more and more of these stories.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  So, you know, and then you'll have the New York Times call me a disinformation agent for literally just telling and sharing these stories of these people that are telling these stories on GAB.
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  And let's talk about how important it is to support GAB and to support Info Wars and some of the other groups out there that aren't, don't see censoring like Rumble.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  But you've got the most multifaceted group out there right now. We're not in competition, the more the merrier.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  Take Ernest Ramirez. I didn't even know, he didn't complain when he was on my show, that they had banned his GoFundMe just to raise money to try to put ads on the internet to tell people about his son and to warn people to check his son was in good health,
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  started to play basketball, had a heart attack, five days after the Moderna shot. And they won't even let him on their Facebook blocking and said, you can't show your local Fox News clip about your dead son.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  I mean, that is so damn criminal.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  Yeah, yeah, GoFundMe is horrible. I would recommend that people use give send go, which is the Christian GoFundMe alternative.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  You know, they're on GAB. We've seen a lot of GABers use them instead of GoFundMe. GoFundMe is just highly politicized. If you're raising money for anything that goes against the narrative of the machine, then it's going to get removed.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  But yeah, I mean, GAB is fully supported by our users. We're launching our advertising program and we're seeing small businesses and business owners on GAB that are doing phenomenally well with that.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  And, you know, it's part of building this alternative society, this alternative economy. So people are starting, they're emailing me and they're saying, hey, you know, I'm leaving my job.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  I'm starting my own business. I want to advertise on GAB to help get the word out and help help get this started. And we'd love to see that.
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  We're also going to be launching a marketplace later this year to compete with Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Craigslist, all those guys to help commerce happen on GAB.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  What we're building here is this infrastructure for an alternative parallel society, alternative parallel economy, where you don't have to get injected with something in order to run a business.
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  And there's the article building infrastructure for a parallel digital economy. That's it. GAB, just search for parallel economy. We'll be right back to talk about something really positive that's coming out of all of this.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  Life saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off the grid bonuses too. Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  Look for the free report, crisis cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design.
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg Group, the trilateral commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:47.000]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head, show on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:56.000]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[2:30:56.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational. The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:19.000]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:44.000]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  InfoWarsStore.com. InfoWarsStore.com is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobetes, and others. So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  Please research, because this is life and death, vitamins that are essential and minerals that are essential. Just type that into a search engine. You will see the top universities, CDC, all of them telling you this, but you won't see this on the nightly news because they don't want you at the big pharma companies to understand how to protect yourself to a great extent from what's going on in the world on a routine basis.
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  We now have back in stock, Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your body's immune system, back in stock, sold out for months. It is essential, it is vital, and it is 50% off so you have no excuse but to get it for yourself and your family.
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:33:09.000]  Winter Sun, back in stock, 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  So I talked about this some Friday on air. I had talked to several Texas doctors that run major Rendezavier counter systems, which is the Regeneron. It's the Rendezavier that's got a 58% chance of killing you if you have COVID and you take it, but that's the thing Fauci pushes.
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  The thing that in studies and tests has actually approved and went through all the process is Regeneron, but you got to get it early because the stuff already does the damage to your lungs.
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  And whatever they're putting out there now is a lot more serious than the COVID we saw last year. That was mainly hype. A lot of scientists think it's being shed off the virus. Others say it's a bio weapon they've released.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  Another string and look how it popped up in Texas and Florida, the places the globalists are targeting. But censorship isn't just about political stuff. It's about big tech merging with big pharma.
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  And it's about once they've merged, which they've done, then they have a stake in suppressing people for profits, but also it's about depopulation.
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  And Google and Facebook both invested at the Wulan lab with Peter Dazik. And then you had the head lab lady under Dazik running the Facebook global response to COVID.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  That's why they were so bold to cook this up and the evidence overwhelming release it on purpose. It wasn't an accidental leak was because they had control of the media and big tech and of the regulators and they could get away with it and you see the power they've used lockstep worldwide to take over.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  So look at this latest article on infowars.com.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  Biden and men limiting supply of monoclonial antibodies in seven southern states under guise of preventing a shortage, even though there's 500 million doses, it only takes one dose, more than enough for every American and then some over 150 million.
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  And we first got reports this last week. Now the article links to local news in Texas and other states where indeed they are not letting people have it.
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  They're also blocking the black so Smith Klein ones, which are not as good. That's only one antibody. We're general has two.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  So I've talked to a lot of medical doctors that don't sell it, but are actually involved in and those that actually run these operations.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  So I'm I don't know any side effects it has. I'm sure it probably does everything does in this world, but it's actually been proven to have 70 plus percent savior rate of folks that are already actually sick with it.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  It's like 99% of you just got it. So regardless, ladies and gentlemen, this is a level of censorship censoring ivermectin censoring.
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  It's not a mass program censoring vitamin D censoring zinc censoring that natural immunity is 13 to 27 times better for COVID in the Israeli study and other show similar numbers.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  So this is about life and death. My people Paris for lack of knowledge, Andrew Torbott. That's the bad news. I want you to elaborate on that if you like, but also good news.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  America and other countries that are freer were founded from persecution. So we've lost our way, but but a large part of this haven't.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  We're going to recreate that. And I know they've lit a fire under you. They've lit a fire under me to work harder to be more focused than ever.
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  And the fact that now it's out in the open and they're openly trying to enslave us. And I think they've been off more than they chew.
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  And I know they launched this global attack because they were losing control already with Trump and Bolsonaro and all the other movements.
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  And so this was their lockstep plan to get controlling and they admit that.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  So the fact that the fact that they were forced to do something, this out of control shows me how really weak they are.
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  This is all going to be a real opportunity. I'm not in this to quote, just make money. I want to be free.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  But so many folks say, man, I wish I'd have known about that long beforehand. No, this is a ramp. I want you to elaborate on it.
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  Well, this is this is the whole future, the whole Renaissance, the whole world, the money will be in patriot communities.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  The money will be in Christian communities. The whole future of innovation and prosperity and freedom is going to be freedom.
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  All the fake tech and all the bots and all that is crap if humans aren't interfacing with it.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  So if the people interfacing with it aren't free, it has zero value. The whole future is freedom and we're promoting freedom.
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  So everybody should get on board because where the globalists are taking us is total destruction.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  Why wouldn't everybody just say no to the short term profit of being a slave in a system and instead take up the chance to be trailblazers
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  into the future and be the new builders that launch the new civilization and people will look back on what we did as an example to the future?
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  Absolutely, Alex. You know, now is the time to start building. I've been saying this for five years. This is what we've been doing here for five years.
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  So what you've been doing for 20 plus years is going our own way trailblazing. Someone has to knock over that first domino.
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  Someone has to carry that cross up the hill and we have to start doing it right now.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  We don't realize how much purchasing power we have, how much power we have just in where we spend our time and how we spend our time.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  You know, we don't have to, you know, change the whole system from the inside out.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  I think it's beyond saving at this point. We need to just start new, start building from scratch.
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  And, you know, the good news is that, you know, we are Americans. This is in our blood.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  This is in our souls. We're builders. We're conquerors. We get things done.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  We have built the greatest country on the face of the planet in the history of humanity and we can do it again.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  We can start over and build from scratch if we unite together as one and start building and start working on this parallel society.
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  It's not going to happen. We're not going to be able to overtake these institutions.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  They're fully captured by the enemy and it's time to accept that.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  So, you know, stop sending your kids to these schools that are fully captured.
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  Stop watching TV programs and entertainment and all this other stuff that is fully captured
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  and is just pumping, you know, lies and propaganda and nonsense in your face 24-7 to demoralize you.
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  You have to take back control of your own home and of your own life and of your own backyard.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  We're talking about this a lot as well. We have to recapture our own towns, our own cities, our own neighborhoods.
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  We're so focused. We're so consumed on the day-to-day drama that's going on in D.C.
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  when most of it really does not have that big of an impact on our lives day-to-day.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  Where we do have a big day-to-day impact is what's going on in our city council.
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  What's going on at our local school board. Go show up. Get involved in local politics. Run for school.
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  They're trying to force inject you. They're trying to create critical race theory.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  The whole Afghanistan thing was just a discredit piece and be a big distraction.
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  They want Biden to be a distraction. He's just a puppet as well.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  Exactly. It's all a big drama. You know, the $50,000 a plate Democrat function.
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  She's wearing a designer dress about tax the rich while all these servants got to wear a mask.
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  I mean, this is Rome in decline. This is Marie Antoinette hours before the storming of the Bastille.
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  This is the end of this global empire in their Ponzi scheme.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  They want it to be the end of us and their great reset and with a great reset of them if we simply stop complying.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  Absolutely. You know, it's been three days talking about the dress that AOC wore at the Met Gala with the elites.
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  Instead of holy cow, people are being fired.
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  People are being forced to choose between providing from their families and being injected with this experimental substance that they don't want in their bodies.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  This is a huge deal. And nobody's talking about everybody is so distracted by these these nuances of this political drama at the national level.
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  And, you know, what did what did AOC tweet today? What is what dress is she wearing? That is not what's important.
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  What's important is that, you know, 100 million people are about to, you know, play the biggest game of chicken this country has ever seen with their employer.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  Or, you know, if they're running their business, they're going to have to fire some people in order to comply with this.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  And by the way, you know, Biden starts with, oh, well, anyone with over 100 employees. Well, what's next?
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  Next, it's going to be 25. Next, it's going to be in order to run a business in the United States of America.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  Every single one of your employees has to be vaccinated.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  There is no end to this slippery slope. They're going to keep pushing the limits as far as they can until we say enough is enough.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  And that's the point that we're at right now.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  I totally agree. We've gone over the slippery slope and the parachute is pulling out of the system as much as we can.
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  Spiritually, then mentally, then physically, in the journey of a thousand miles, starts with a single step.
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  Again, people should go read your articles at gab.com.
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Andrew Torba, where's the best place to find your excellent articles about the exodus?
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  Or I should just post them both at infowars.com with links to you as well.
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  Everybody needs to share these. This is information warfare. Tell us the name of the articles again.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  The Parallel Society just saying nay.
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  Yeah, it's news.gab.com.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  That's our blog where all these articles can be found.
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  And I've got some great responses on them. People are really enjoying these reads and they need to be shared with other people, too.
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  These ideas need to be shared.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  You can take, I don't care if you give me credit or not, just get these ideas out there and we need more people talking about this stuff.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  We're already making a shirt that says come and vaccinate me instead of come and take it.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  But if you say, I'm going to put one out with that design right there.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  I love that where it says, do you guys put up the vaccine thing up again?
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  That was really, really powerful. You guys just showed where it says come and make me.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  I mean, this is so anti-human, so ridiculous, so over the top, so ridiculous.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  Andrew Torbo, thank you so much.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  Thank you, Alex. Always a pleasure.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  There it is. What does a Parallel Society look like?
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  I'm making a t-shirt out of this. He said use it.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  Come and make me. Let me say something to you during the break, Andrew, because I want to advertise with you guys to reach the most hardcore people that are on Gab.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  Very exciting. We want to see Gab explode. We want to see it be a billion-dollar company.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  We want to see the enemy defeated in the free market. That's why Big Tech is so scared.
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:56.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  The general public does not even know that.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  So when that criminal with his pedophile crackhead son gets up there on television and tells you that you are to blame because you didn't take your poison shot, that is a giant lie.
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  Countries like Israel and Singapore with the highest vaccine rate have the highest death and highest illness rates.
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  That is the facts. Get that information out to your friends, family and strangers like your life depends on it because it does.
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  This headline is not a joke. This is America in September of 2020.
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  DC court sends man to jail for watching conspiracy theory videos online. Yes, it says the police did a spot check for quote compliance at his home and found him in his garage watching rumble social media site, which they say is a conspiracy site.
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  Also, he admitted to watching Mike Lindell's three-day cyber symposium. Yes, it was part of the conditions of his bail. The judge said he could not look at any videos questioning the election. No joke.
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  And so they sent the stars into his house and caught him doing it. So now he's going into solitary confinement.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:45:04.000]  Communism has come to America. The Republic has fallen. The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  We have forced them out in the open. So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller. Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  And my bet ended up to be successful so far. Folks are ordering it in mass. They're getting great responses. They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does, taken out of the tongue, where it's more absorbable.
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, help the body produce more energy, help produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function and so much more.
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basics already in your body like vitamin B12, whether you're old, whether you're young, whether you're black, whether you're white, whether you live in Japan or the United States.
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:59.000]  Ultra 12 is the best vitamin B12 they're going to find out there. It's uber, absorbable, and it's 50% off right now at infowarslife.com.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  They're trying to overthrow Trump and spy on him. We're so deadly on target that if that gets to Congress or other people that are not that intelligent, it'll be over for the New World Order.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  But they want Andrew Torba off because he's got the biggest, most successful system, GAB, that gets better and better under massive attack because they don't want you having any communication when they carry out their globalist top.
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  And they say that now in Congress and they say that in the state of Texas over for free speech but not GAB because they allow people to say whatever they want as long as it's not violent.
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  Well, that's freedom. And again, ladies and gentlemen, Torba is at the center of this. I was about to say bye to him and cover a bunch of news.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  I said, how are you doing? He said, well, the German government's coming at us. I totally forgot the German government's trying to shut GAB down.
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  So this is globalism, folks, with our free speech gone. It's not just big tech censoring us. It's foreign governments. So Andrew Torba from GAB.com tells us about that.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  Yeah, I wanted to stay for another segment because I forgot to bring this up. This is breaking news as of this afternoon, actually.
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  The German government has been coming at us for about a year now and trying to force us to comply with their draconian censorship laws.
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  Now, obviously, we're not going to do that. So now they're coming after us with these fines of tens of thousands of euros and other legal action.
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  And basically, I've been talking to our lawyers this week and they said that we have more or less three options.
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  We can obey German censorship laws and start censoring German content that the government doesn't like, which obviously we're not going to do.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  That's not going to happen. We can disobey German censorship and basically ignore this and try to pick a fight with an entire nation state.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  You know, as a small tech startup, I basically wouldn't be able to leave the U.S. ever again.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  They come after us from every possible angle through state-sponsored deplatforming and really, Lord knows what else.
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  Or we can cease providing the service in Germany by blocking German IPs.
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  And of course, many Germans are already using VPNs and other ways to access GAB.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  So I think that is probably our best option at this point is to just block German IPs in order to be in compliance and get the entire nation state of Germany off our back.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  It's this small tech startup here.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  Well, I had just seen an article a week ago where they mentioned you and others at the German state was looking at you.
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  They're already finding you as this is already started and this is breaking.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  Yeah, yeah, they're coming after us hard.
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  I mean, we got sent, they sent a huge packet of all these laws and all this stuff that we're breaking.
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  So they're coming after us hard.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  And, you know, unfortunately, we just we don't have the resources to take on an entire nation state right now.
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  So, you know, according to our lawyers, our best course of action right now is to block German IPs temporarily until we can figure a better solution out.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  But that'll be your fault when they use other systems to get around it.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  This is the tyranny of world government.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  We're already living in it.
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  For those that don't know, they go live on Facebook feeds and SWAT team doctors that tell people about vitamin C and vitamin D.
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  And they attack women with German shepherds and police forces and blow their eyeballs out with high powered water cannons.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  I mean, Germany is a hellish place again.
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  It's it's absolute madness.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  And, you know, the fact that they're concerned about us, we we have German users certainly, but not that many.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  I mean, we're primarily a US based English speaking website.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  So the fact that they're that focused on us is really something it maybe tells me that we're more of a threat than we think that we are over.
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  Look how big you've gotten in Brazil.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  I mean, come on, you are exploding.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  They're scared of you.
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  These are tyrants.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  Everybody should rally behind you.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Yeah, it's unfortunate what's going on.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  But, you know, like I said at this time, we don't have the resources to take on an entire nation state.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  So we have to do what we have to do.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  And I think that the Germans will figure out how to get around this, the German people.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  And, you know, it's just something that I wanted to be fully transparent with our community about because under no circumstances are we going to, you know, start censoring on behalf of a foreign government.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  Now, we have we have the foreign governments reach out all the time trying to get us to censor stuff and hand over user data and all this stuff.
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  And, you know, we tell them to get lost all the time.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  But now they're, you know, Germany is really starting to bring down the hammer.
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  So yeah, let's talk about Australia.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  They've done a regulatory from the crown director general.
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  So it shows that the legislature, the parliament's just puppet.
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  Just like Canada, people think they're free.
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  But their governor general has come out and said, we're just going to read everybody's private text and emails and social media without asking.
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  And we'll pose issue and send out messages if we want saying, don't go to a demonstration.
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  So they said, we'll take your identity to and then five years in jail if we want.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  I mean, Australia is like the new North Korea, but with the Western civilization they're feeding on.
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  It's absolutely crazy.
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  And I think that we're going to start to see more and more of this, this balkanization of the Internet and of the West in general.
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  And unless again, unless we start to break off and build right now, you know, we're not going to have anything.
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  There's just going to be ash.
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  So, you know, we need to start building our own parallel societies and, you know, our own parallel Internet and and fighting back against this.
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  It's the only way forward because it's just going to get worse and worse.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:34.000]  You know, we've already given them over the past two years, we've given them too much of our freedoms.
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  We've given them too much of our liberty.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  And now they're getting bolder and bolder by the day and they're pushing further and further.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  And it's just, it's not going to stop until, you know, they eliminate us all or we're all in jail or worse.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  So that's right.
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  This is real tyranny.
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:58.000]  And Andrew, in closing, people have to really let that sink in and understand that this is a global medical depopulation tyranny in their own words.
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  And I think we'll now see that I wasn't exaggerating years ago that they really mean to implement every bit of what they've set up.
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  And so that's why it's it's resist or die, isn't it?
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  Absolutely, Alex.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  Turn off the football came, you know, turn off the Netflix, turn off the mainstream media news, start building, start caring about the future for your kids, the future for our country.
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  Now is the time stop being distracted by the enemy's distractions and start building.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  That would be my message.
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  General Milley, thank you so much, Andrew.
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  Amazing job.
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  We have.com.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  General Milley has put out a statement.
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  I'll tell you about it.
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  The next 15 minutes that Jay Dyer is going to be taking over, General Milley has come out with a statement.
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  There goes Andrew Torvo of gab.com.
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  Let me just say something here before I had all this other news that's breaking.
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  There's so much my head spinning.
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  That's pretty latest article from zero hedge.
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  He's come out and made a statement.
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  We'll post on him for your heads.com.
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:54:00.000]  Let me just explain something here.
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  Let me explain why the globalists are doing this, they're satanic, they're evil, they're jealous, they're into themselves, they're selfish.
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  But they believe because of advanced technologies, we're going to reach an Atlantean moment,
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  whether Atlantis existed or not, a new Atlantis moment where we blow ourselves up because of our technology.
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  But then they're the ones proliferating all the dangerous stuff at the same time and destabilizing things.
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  But that's their excuse.
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  We've got to get rid of people to save the earth.
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  We've got to have a total tyranny, total surveillance of AI so that, you know, rogue states don't create a bio weapon that kills everybody.
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  So we'll release a small bio weapon to train everybody to lock down during a crisis.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  This is all a global drill.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  You'll be rewarded for carrying it out.
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  That's what they told them.
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  I've had people that served heads of state, Hillary Clinton, Merkel, you name it, on this show.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  I've had three star generals on the show who said they're going to release a weapon and use it to lock stuff down and control society.
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  And then it's in the documents.
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  So you've got to come to grips with this.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  And, you know, see this cell phone right here, it tracks you, it controls you, I put it in a Faraday cage when I don't use it.
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  And I've got the apps and all that stuff turned off, but it's still a very dangerous Trojan horse tool.
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  It's a dangerous weapon.
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  Like George Washington said, government is like fire, a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  But do you understand that the Apple iPhone they estimate has $200 billion of investment just in the development of it?
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  It's a trillion plus dollar company.
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  $200 billion just to do all this.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  So yeah, I could dial in if I had a Facebook or YouTube and go live and all this great technology.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  That's billions of dollars of research.
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  We don't have all that.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  We've got to pay millions of dollars per quarter in bandwidth.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  We've got to pay millions to have our own systems and our own interfaces and our own encoders.
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  And we're trying to build a bunch of that with money right now.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  And we've got a whole bunch of stuff constructed and almost ready.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  And like I said, I already have my house sold if the freeze didn't break the pipes and flood some of it.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  So that's getting fixed.
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  I'm going to take that money with pleasure.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  My goal is to have basically nothing, everything put into this place, everything expended in the fight.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  We've got a bunch of other resistance going on.
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  So I need you to help us.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  I need you to word of mouth, spread the word.
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  I need you to support all the other great folks we've got my word of mouth like Gab.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  And I need you for your own self to get products you need.
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  You know, it's a great way to trigger leftist.
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  And we've come up with a new t shirt.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  We put it on screen for folks that says I hate Alex Jones.
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  And then on the back, it says, don't visit info wars.com.
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  And then there's our great don't tread on me new design with the American flag and rattlesnake.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  I think that's awesome as well.
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:44.000]  But we've got a new you go to infowarstore.com.
[2:56:44.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  You can see it.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  The new Alex Jones.
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  I hate Alex Jones.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  And then on the back, the same t shirt says don't visit info wars.com.
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  It's a really good looking t shirt.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  I'm really, really proud of it.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  Now click the back for me.
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  Thanks.
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  And I just hope everybody gets it that way.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  You can be incognito.
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  You can be around them.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  You can hear what they have to say.
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  And they're so into themselves.
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  They're going to actually believe it's real, but it's going to make them visit the website.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  Don't visit info wars.com.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  And I hate Alex Jones.
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  It's a new shirt.
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  Notice it's 995.
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  The shirt cost us.
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  It's on good fabric and printed in America.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  We printed in China.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  It's going to be $3.
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  The shirt cost us about $7.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  After everything else costs us $9.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  So it's 995.
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  All the shirts are at cost.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  Whatever they cost, it's a big t shirt sale, including our new shirt.
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  I hate Alex Jones.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  Get it.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  Although there's a new shirt talking about too.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  Come and take it with a big vaccine injector on it.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  And Trump won.
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:49.000]  And so much more.
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the new world order.
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  And Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers through the UN.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  And they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want, when they want, and to have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone of their new world ID.
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:28.000]  And now their puppet Biden has announced the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:30.000]  This is criminal.
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  And he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it.
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:35.000]  They say that's a 20, 25 maybe.
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:38.000]  They just expanded the emergency authorization.
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:44.000]  Well, you live to see an absolute new world order world government.
[2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:48.000]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:53.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:58:53.000 --> 2:58:55.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:58:55.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:01.000]  But we failed.
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:03.000]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[2:59:03.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization.
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:11.000]  Great reset.
[2:59:11.000 --> 2:59:17.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show,
[2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:25.000]  And we've also got to get personally prepared.
[2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:33.000]  You've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:38.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:46.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[2:59:46.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:12.000]  Eric Clapton bringing us in almost killed by the Pfizer poison.
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  Now he's getting censured online when he says we shouldn't be forced to take shots.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:21.000]  Yep, all the tyranny goes hand in glove.
[3:00:21.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  But we're going to fight back.
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  We let the tyranny grow and grow.
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  Now we start turning the corner.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  There's a lot of big breaking news right now and I got more in the next segment.
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  Biden urges climate action.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  We don't have much more than 10 years.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  Remember what AOC said two years ago.
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  We have 12 years, 20, 30.
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  You're going to claim, oh, you're all dying because of global warming.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  It made super bugs that really came out of Luan.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  New York Times President Biden warned today that the United States had only a decade left to confront a global climate crisis using his second day.
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  Turing a wildfire ravaged area.
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  Here's another one.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  Biden to call on world leaders to commit to vaccinating 70% of the world.
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  And once you do that, they go, actually, it's 100%.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  Actually, it's boosters.
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  Actually, it's five shots.
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  It's 10 shots.
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  Actually, it doesn't work.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  Your immune system is gone.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  Devastating information.
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  And now this, and listen, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  But I do want to go on as a guest there because I'm told it's a popular show, but that's not really the big news.
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  I'll talk about it in a minute.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  Jim Hoff's got a syndicated show now.
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  Breaking exclusive.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  Roger Stone served by Deep State while speaking on air with the Gateway pundits, Joe Hoff, the brother of Jim Hoff.
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  So they both, I guess, co-hosted.
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  I love getting him on my show.
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  Roger Stone was a guest this morning at Tomorrow's News Today with Joe Hoff and his other host, a St. Louis conservative talk show station, Real Talk 93.3.
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  Stone was excellent, as usual, and sharp as he can be.
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  He discussed the many cases of abuse and injustices that he suffered as a result of the evil corrupt agencies in Washington, D.C. during the Trump years.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  Stone shared about how he turned to Jesus, and it goes on from there, and he then got served during the show.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  The discussion was short, but here is what happened.
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  Hold on a second. I have a process server at my door about to serve me, at least it wasn't 50 SWAT team people.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:42.000]  On my latest lawsuit, I'm going to take this live on your radio show, and then they brought it to him and they gave it to him for the Capitol, saying he was behind the Capitol and launched that whole attack.
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  But I love it.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  Tomorrow's News Today, the Info Wars tagline, I guess came to me five, six, seven years ago.
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  I'm just like, you know, we're really tomorrow's news today because we know it's going to break later.
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  We know what's going to happen later. We know the whole globalist operation.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  So you really are getting tomorrow's news today.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:04.000]  You're getting that vision, that research, that connection.
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  And then I get really upset, man.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  I know all this stuff.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  I know in the rat studies, they made these same vaccines under other names for a decade and killed them, and it caused blood clots.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  And we knew in heart attacks and sterilization and cancer.
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  And I'm just sitting here totally blown away every millisecond.
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  I am just, this is all I think about now.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  This is all I dream about.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  You know, I used to have dreams about interesting things, boring things, wild things.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  Now I just dream about this.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  I'm at the office all day in my brain when I'm awake, when I'm asleep, because it's just so incredible that we're just sitting here on air while they censor everybody and sue the Gateway Pundit and sue one American news and Newsmax and sue us.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  And they say the goal is to bankrupt us.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  Their goal is to close our doors.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  And you know, that's what they say.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  They don't want judgments to try to get money from you.
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  They don't want that.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  They want to shut you down with rigged courts, rigged situations.
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  And you just don't know how rigged this country is, folks.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  It is gone.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  And we have to admit to ourselves it's gone.
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  And we have to just come to grips with the fact that our governments run by pedophiles and scum and just every form of sycophantic trash you can imagine.
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:26.000]  And just realize that if you are supporting and none of us are perfect and it's hard to not do it sometimes, but you should go out of your way.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  I'll never forget I was covered in Bilderberg 11 years ago in north of London.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  And the cops came to see me with MI6 and MI5 and talked about what we were really planning.
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  We had thousands showing up to rally.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  I met with them and they didn't even drink a Coca-Cola while I had dinner with them the first night I got there.
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  And they said, you know, why are you staying at a big chain hotel?
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  You say you're Mr. Anti-Establishment.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  I would never spend my money.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  You should be staying at a local inn or something.
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  I said, you know what, you're right.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:50.000]  In the future, I'll try to do that if it's able.
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  It's just that simple.
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  It's just that simple.
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  All right, we'll be right back on the other side.
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:53.000]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:06:16.000]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:19.000]  Well, I got approached.
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:20.000]  Oh my gosh.
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  Probably a year ago now was really just getting cranked up by a very well-known successful award-winning filmmaker.
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:36.000]  We wanted to make a film with Info Wars about COVID-19 and where it was going.
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  And part one was what they did and they just finished it like a week ago up until what's happened now.
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  That's part one.
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  They're making four other parts that will be done by early next year.
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  Part two will be out just a few months.
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  And it's a very high-quality, very well-done film that's designed to wake up sheeple and folks that don't know what's going on.
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  But it's still very, very riveting.
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:07:00.000]  It's very important information, but it's done in like a PBS or 60-minute style.
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:03.000]  And it interviews a lot of amazing people.
[3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  So they interviewed me and we were involved and they just said, we want to make this an Info Wars film.
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  They already made a bunch of big movies.
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  They got involved and absolutely have lent our name to it and they wanted to launch it with us.
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  And they also just want to get their money back from the film so they can make more.
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:32.000]  And that's why when Africa comes out on DVD, it's going to be made available for free at Bandod Video.
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:38.000]  So by buying a DVD, you get a hard copy that you have that you're going to be able to share with others and make copies of it.
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:42.000]  It has a zero country code meaning it works anywhere in the world and they want you to make copies.
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:47.000]  It's 1995 and then you get a free copy of Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  I'm just throwing that in because I want you to get it.
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  And so they are giving us part of the money that comes in and the rest goes to the filmmaker.
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  The backer is just giving this money over to get it out.
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  So understand that.
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:07.000]  This is a desperate attempt to save humanity.
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:14.000]  And if this film goes viral, we'll put all five-part series up on Bandod Video.
[3:08:14.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  But they could take that down any day.
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:18.000]  They're attacking it. They're trying to hack it. They're suing us.
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:22.000]  And again, they've told us, we want to shut you down. We want to silence you. That's our goal.
[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:24.000]  I mean, soon I'm going to talk about this.
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:26.000]  No one's ever seen anything like this.
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:28.000]  The level of stuff is just unprecedented.
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:34.000]  But you need to have the DVD, just like you need to have Endgame that predicted it all and shows their admissions.
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  And now here we are. The two go together like a horse and carriage.
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  Part one is a whole film, lengthy, powerful, jam-packed.
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  It's got everybody in it.
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, I mean, myself.
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  The list goes on and on. It's so professionally done.
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  I'm so blessed to work with these people.
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:58.000]  So everybody listening, you need to go get one copy for $19.95,
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:00.000]  get an additional free copy of Endgame.
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  We've been for global enslavement. And then for $19.95 more, you can also get an extra copy of it.
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  So for $20.95, you get two copies of COVID Landpart 1, the film, the miniseries,
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  and then you get the free copy of Endgame as well.
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  So you have a copy for yourself and a copy to give to the library or church.
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  But we want you to make copies. We want you to make copies,
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  but we need to get the money back that it costs to make this.
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  So the filmmaker that donated his time and the crew get paid.
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  They've not been paid. And again, they don't give a damn about money.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:36.000]  They are totally committed. These folks have made some really big films that have been very, very successful.
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  They're just donating to get this out because things are so serious.
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  And so I really am counting on you to make sure their sacrifice goes all the way.
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  I want you to order it. It ships in three weeks.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:50.000]  It's been made right here in the USA. We've got the copies.
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  There are only 18-wheeler coming here right now.
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  But we've got the proof of it and all the rest of it. It's amazing.
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  Start shipping in three weeks. Get your preorders in at covidland.com
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  or infowarstore.com. We'll put it on the front page of infowarstore.com.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  covidland.com. Pre-order it today.
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:11.000]  And then hopefully they make their money back in the next three weeks
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  because then we're going to put it for free out on the Internet for everybody.
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  And I hope you'll at least share it because, man, the new lockdowns are coming.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  And the only way to stop this is you taking action.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  And these filmmakers and the producer has really, really done a great job
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  for info wars and have been huge supporters.
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  And so they're a godsend.
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  And I'm just hoping that God continues to send blessings like this.
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  So thank you so much to the makers of this.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  But it's the first info wars official documentary production in nine years.
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  We teamed up with Paul Wittenberg from Framing the World Productions
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  to produce a five-part documentary series, covidland.
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  I voice it as well.
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  Episode one is called The Lockdown, The Chronicles, the early days of covid-19 pandemic
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  and shows how big tech, MSCM and governments deceived the world
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  into accepting lockdowns, use fraudulent cases,
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  inflated death numbers and fake news to take over.
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  You can pre-order covidland, the lockdown,
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:11.000]  on high quality dbd at infowarstore.com or covidland.com for just 1995.
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  And each order comes with a free copy of in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  Now the criminal elites are gearing up for lockdown 2
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  and the only way to stop them is by getting a physical copy of the dbd
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:22.000]  and making copies and getting it out.
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  Show it. I mean, it's free to air.
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  Show it at local TV station. Pay them to play it.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  Put it on access. Just fight back, folks.
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  You rent out theaters and show it.
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  It has a zero country codes that will play anywhere
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  and you can make your own copies.
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:40.000]  Educational purposes and share with your local election officials,
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  friends and neighbors and thought leaders.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  This is an info war becoming a physical war.
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  You've got to win in the info war before the global is triggered, the physical war.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  We must stop lockdown 2, get the dbd and get it out to everyone you know
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  because the filmmaking team really wants you to get the dbd and share it.
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  If you order a second copy of covidland for only 9.95,
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  you get an extra copy of a second copy of in-game.
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  And that's an interesting typo that they just lost in translation
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  when we were coming up with the deal. That's fine.
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  Cost me an extra dollar. I'll do it. I don't care.
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  Yes, you get two copies of in-game when you get an extra copy of covidland.
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  Sure. All I care about is getting it out.
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  So get two of the film and get two copies of in-game free
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:21.000]  and get the other copy of the film for 9.95.
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  For 29.95, you get four dbd's.
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  1995, one copy of covidland dbd, free in-game dbd.
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  29.95, two copies of covidland, two free in-game dbd's.
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  Go to covidland.com and help stop lockdown 2.
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  I mean, this is it, folks. This is the big fight
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  and please support our local AM and FM stations.
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  Please support them and spread the word.
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:47.000]  The globalists are trying to shut down the real economy.
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  They're trying to bankrupt the Christian economy, the American economy.
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  We are at war with the Great Reset. We've been declared non-essential.
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  And I told you, I'm not laying down.
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  I've been busy doing four, five hours a radio day
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  running these operations. I've made a film in nine years.
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  I got heavily involved in this and spent a lot of time on it.
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  And we're now almost done with part two.
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  It's going to go into production in a few weeks.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  So it'll come out like one comes out,
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  and then about a month another comes out,
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  and then about a month and a half later another comes out.
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:17.000]  But then we've got to get those done.
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:19.000]  They've got the basic film stuff almost done,
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  but they're adding new information as it goes up to the line
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  so people get this data and this intel.
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:25.000]  And people can watch seeing it all day.
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  Once they see the truth, once it unlocks their mind.
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  So loose change, in-game.
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  My other films that I produced and made and directed exploded.
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  Okay? So that's up to you, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:43.000]  to get out to everyone you know and to share.
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  Because it's going to affect the world.
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  You know, people didn't want to touch DVDs six, seven years ago.
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  The newest thing was Netflix and all the computers.
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  Now everybody has a nostalgia. DVDs are coming back.
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  The stuff disappears, stuff gets re-edited, stuff gets destroyed.
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  So get the film, burn copies, put it on your hard drive,
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  share it everywhere, take clips out of it, re-edit it, do whatever you want.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  I'll stand on my head and light my hair on fire
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  if you'll just fight the globalist.
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  It's only going to get worse.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  This is life and death.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  Now people get why I'm so upset.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  You know how many people I know in Austin
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  whose children, girls and boys have died
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  after taking these damn shots?
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  I know five people whose children have died of heart attacks.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  Healthy children.
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  Now they're coming for the under-12s.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  Are we going to just roll over to this?
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  Or are we going to fight back?
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  Get COVID Land Part 1, The Lockdown for $19.95
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  with a free copy of in-game now.
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  Get it.
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  And down the road, hopefully they'll do some deals
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  where you get like 10 copies for $20 or something.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  But right now, they will need to make their money back
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  because he needs to pay for all the flights
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  and all the hotels and all the people
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  for the filmmaker
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  and the crew.
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  So infowarstore.com or triple-825-33139.
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  Do not wait, take action.
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  God bless you all.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  Alright, J. Dyer is amazing.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  He knows even more than I do about the latest globalist reset in their books.
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  He's read hundreds of them.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  Even though I learn stuff when I do,
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  because it just pisses me off so bad.
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  But actually, I do read constantly.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  But he reads even more than I do.
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  And he'll tell you how their point blank coming for you and your family
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  and the attack is now.
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  And then coming up in 45 minutes,
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  Owen Shroyer and The War Room
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  kicking butt, great guests, great calls.
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  Owen is just doing a great job.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  Infowars.com
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  forward slash show, Band-Aught Video.
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  I don't keep coming to you and saying we got to fight.
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  We got to fight because it's a war.
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  Not like on a football game where you cheer your team
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  and maybe it helps them.
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:34.000]  You are under attack. You are on the field.
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  You are in a death battle against
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:38.000]  the New World Order.
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  Even those of you that pose like you're part of the system
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  and laugh this off because you're delusional,
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  you're being targeted as well. You will pay.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  You will be killed.
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  The globalists will implant you with cancer
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  and you will die just like your father.
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:22.000]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  in a crazy COVID culture?
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:26.000]  Me too.
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:28.000]  But listen, after all the research,
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:30.000]  all the conflicting studies,
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  after all the squabbling,
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:34.000]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  It's that immune system health
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:38.000]  can literally be the difference between life and death.
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:40.000]  You probably already believe that.
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:42.000]  I certainly do.
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  So here's the thing.
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  I wanted to get past the craziness
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:48.000]  and find out one thing
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  to get past the craziness
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  and find out which plant-based substances
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:54.000]  actually have studies that demonstrate
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:16:58.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:00.000]  but you can check out what I've discovered
[3:17:00.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  at StrongerDefense.com.
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:04.000]  No cures or treatments there.
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:06.000]  Instead, little known but shocking
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  immune system research
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  and a breakthrough immune support product
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  based on that research called
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:14.000]  Immune10x.
[3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:16.000]  In the best part, you can go to the StrongerDefense website
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:18.000]  and name your own supply of Immune10x
[3:17:18.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  without paying anything today.
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  Crazy, right?
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:24.000]  Learn more about this unusual, limited-time offer
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  at StrongerDefense.com
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:47.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  All such thing is a hopeless tax case. Call 834-NO-TAX
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:01.000]  It's only been in the last 60 years
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:03.000]  that we've had satellites that can decently
[3:18:03.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:08.000]  But if you look at all the different studies
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:11.000]  about my NASA and other governments and other agencies,
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:17.000]  The only constant, the only great truth is
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:20.000]  change is the only constant.
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:23.000]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:26.000]  But notice, first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:28.000]  and then it's going to be global warming
[3:18:28.000 --> 3:18:30.000]  and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:32.000]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:34.000]  But did you know that man-made climate change
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  is a real thing
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  when it comes to the United Nations
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  and the Department of Energy
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  and Bill Gates and the UN?
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  They control trees for 1979
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:48.000]  for a very long time.
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:50.000]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:52.000]  for an idea of spraying different particles
[3:18:52.000 --> 3:18:54.000]  out of jet engines to control the weather.
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:57.000]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:02.000]  If you think the puppet president, Joe Biden,
[3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:05.000]  coming out and announcing that 100 million Americans
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  are going to be forced to take experimental shots
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:10.000]  or lose their jobs,
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:12.000]  we understand we know the blueprint of the UN.
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:14.000]  They've stated their plan.
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  Contact tracers coming to your house,
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  10 forced injections a year,
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  the destruction of your immune system,
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:22.000]  the depopulation of the planet
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:24.000]  and the vaccine passport
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  on your, quote, iPhone or droid,
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:28.000]  tracking and tracing everything you do
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  and telling you when you can go outside of your house
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  or where you can go, not just for COVID-19,
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:34.000]  but for carbon taxes.
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:36.000]  So as I've said a thousand times,
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:38.000]  submission is death.
[3:19:38.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  You give in to this just for your job
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  or to be able to go to the bar
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:44.000]  or to be able to, quote, flaunt an airplane.
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:46.000]  Then they're going to slowly put the screws in
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  with these apps on your phone
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  to control where you go and what you do
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:52.000]  and dog train you right into total slavery.
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:54.000]  This is criminal, it's illegal,
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:56.000]  it's tyranny and we must resist
[3:19:56.000 --> 3:20:08.000]  and not comply.
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  You know, it's a really lame thing
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:30.000]  to spend years building
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:32.000]  your own alternative media platform,
[3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:34.000]  profile, work, content,
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  how did it happen to me
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  and you get the platform, right?
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  You build an audience
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:42.000]  and really a lot of these tech companies,
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:44.000]  they relied on the creativity
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  and the power of the people,
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:48.000]  their audience, they bring everybody on
[3:20:48.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  as a bridge and then once
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:52.000]  they've built the platform, everybody's there,
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:54.000]  then they screw over the people
[3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:56.000]  and demonetize them, deplatform them
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  and so forth, it's happened to me,
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  I've lost my website in the past,
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:02.000]  I've lost monetization on YouTube
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:04.000]  and we've also had people on as guests
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  who are in the sphere
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:08.000]  of entertainment, comedy, we've had
[3:21:08.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  Sam Tripoli, we've had Sam Hyde
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  and now we've got one of the
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  guys from the skating world,
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  if you don't know, the skateboarding world has
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  blowed up, it's gotten crazy, right?
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  It's now, it's a popular thing,
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:22.000]  used to be a nerdy thing
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  to talk to, a black listed
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:26.000]  and censored skater,
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  his name is Wecking Ball
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  and he's also a funny guy, he's not just
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:32.000]  a skater, he has many talents, he's a renaissance
[3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  man
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  and he is a content
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  a content creator on Patreon
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  and I want to talk to him
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  if he's there, are you there Weck?
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:46.000]  Yes sir, I'm here Mr. Jay Dyer.
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:50.000]  What's up man, hey
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:52.000]  tell us a little bit about yourself
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:54.000]  first before we get into what happened
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:56.000]  to you and the bad experiences that you've had
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:21:58.000]  how did you get into the world
[3:21:58.000 --> 3:22:00.000]  of skating and then what did you do
[3:22:00.000 --> 3:22:02.000]  to build your own audience and your own
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:04.000]  kind of career and then tell us more
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  about what a pro skater is
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  versus somebody who's not, how that ties
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  into the corporate scam of the skateboarding
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:12.000]  world and where all that's going?
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  Surely, first
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  Jay, I just want to thank you for having me
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  on the American Far Right
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  conspiracy theory and fake
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  news website owned by Alex Jones
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  it's a pleasure
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:28.000]  to be here
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  Yes, so how I got into skateboarding
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:34.000]  is that what you were firstly asking sir?
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  Yes, a little bit about you
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  Okay, so
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:42.000]  yes, so I got into skateboarding
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  at a very young age
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  I like doing athletic things
[3:22:46.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  and I did a lot of team sports
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  growing up but
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  they just weren't for me, I didn't really like
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  the idea of possibly losing
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  because
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:22:58.000]  somebody else on the team did not perform well
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:00.000]  I liked skateboarding because it was
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  something that I could do
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  just by myself with very little
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  equipment
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:08.000]  and it was also
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  something that
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:12.000]  it was a very creative way
[3:23:12.000 --> 3:23:14.000]  to be athletic, you
[3:23:14.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  learn and you can even create your own tricks
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:18.000]  so
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  for me
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:22.000]  growing up as a young kid
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  that was how I got into it
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:26.000]  and I also liked the aspect of it
[3:23:26.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  that it was kind of
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:30.000]  like
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:32.000]  an underground kind of
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:34.000]  status back then
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:36.000]  It was a subculture, right?
[3:23:36.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  It was a counterculture subculture
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:40.000]  This is in
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  the late 90s
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:44.000]  back then
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:46.000]  if you told somebody you skateboard
[3:23:46.000 --> 3:23:48.000]  they probably would just think
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:50.000]  you rode the skateboard down the street
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:52.000]  to the store or something like that
[3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:54.000]  but
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:23:56.000]  they didn't really understand it
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  Right, that's what I do now
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  I used to skate to the street now
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:02.000]  Now you're a big segue
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:04.000]  Exactly, because I'm just trying to fight
[3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:06.000]  like
[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:08.000]  carbon and everything so
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  I put my
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:12.000]  heavy truck on pause for now
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:14.000]  and I ride my electric segue to the store
[3:24:14.000 --> 3:24:16.000]  so I can get my soy milk
[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:18.000]  You're a good global citizen, right?
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  Yes, sir
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  Alright, so tell us about this
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  and then you're into skating
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  you start to build an audience
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  and you kind of got to where
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:30.000]  you're basically at the skill level
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  of pro but
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:34.000]  as you explained to me pro skateboarding
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  now is kind of like tied into
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  corporate deals, right?
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  This is where we get into the bad news
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:42.000]  because now they're socially
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:44.000]  engineering every niche, every
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:46.000]  subculture
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:48.000]  That's right, so
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  I actually built my fan base
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  around my comedy
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:54.000]  and
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:24:56.000]  for lack of better words
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:24:58.000]  maybe trolling on social media
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  but
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  the phrase pro skater
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  to everybody
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  that is a pro skater
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  definition or the industry
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  would be that you are
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  recognized
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  by a corporate brand
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:16.000]  and they are acknowledging that you're worthy
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  to be paid and be on their team
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:20.000]  but
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:22.000]  so that kind of
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  eliminates any room for
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:26.000]  someone doing professional skating
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  independently
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:30.000]  which is what I do
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:32.000]  and
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  it's very tough, a lot of people don't
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  really agree that I'm
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:38.000]  quote unquote a professional skateboarder
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:40.000]  but I do sell skateboards
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:42.000]  so I'm getting paid to skateboard
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  which is the definition of being a professional
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:46.000]  Well, does that
[3:25:46.000 --> 3:25:48.000]  play more into maybe
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  the fact that you've trolled a lot of people
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:52.000]  that you've done a lot of
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  I guess you could say
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:56.000]  counterculture type of content
[3:25:56.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  you've had some problems with
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:00.000]  censorship, right?
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  Absolutely, and I think
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:04.000]  that maybe part of the reason that
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:06.000]  these guys don't really
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:08.000]  want me to be acknowledged
[3:26:08.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  as being someone that can have an audience
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:12.000]  in skateboarding is because I didn't take
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  the path that they did
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:16.000]  and climb up the
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:18.000]  ladder of these corporate brands
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:20.000]  and pay their dues
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:22.000]  I just did it on my own
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  so they really don't want to acknowledge
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:26.000]  what I have
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:28.000]  that I deserve it
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  But Jim, you aren't like
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:32.000]  supremely political, right?
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  You weren't doing a lot of political
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  skateboarding content
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  It was just the humor, right?
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  They went after the Sathur and the comedy, right?
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:42.000]  Right, yeah, I still
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  am not political
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:46.000]  Sometimes I'll take stabs
[3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  at the NSA
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:50.000]  or something like that
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:52.000]  but nobody really knows what
[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:54.000]  my political thoughts are
[3:26:54.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  I don't really get into that
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:26:58.000]  My comedy
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:00.000]  as far as the skateboarding
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:02.000]  related things go
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  I just
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:06.000]  poke fun at things that are just
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  goofy and they're like forced
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  cringe, you know, I'm sure you know about that
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:12.000]  I'm an expert at cringe
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  I'm really skilled with cringe
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:16.000]  so yes
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:18.000]  Me too, I embrace the cringe
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:20.000]  Sometimes I make fun of myself
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:22.000]  which is
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  I don't see how they could get mad
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:26.000]  when I'm the butt of the joke sometimes
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:28.000]  Right
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:30.000]  What happened in terms of the censorship
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  can you give some examples
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:34.000]  you collab with Sam Hyde
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  was it as a result of that
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  or were you starting to get heat
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  prior to that?
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  No, I can't
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  I always
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:46.000]  As soon as my fan base was being built
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:48.000]  I already was done with
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  because what happened was there was guys
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  that are in the skateboarding industry
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:54.000]  that just know everyone
[3:27:54.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  don't put this guy on your team
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  Oh wow
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:00.000]  Yeah, so
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  that kind of forced me into doing it myself
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  anyway, you know and
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  looking back at that now I'm glad it went that way
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  because the way that things have spawned now
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:10.000]  in the skateboarding industry
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:12.000]  like you said it was a counterculture
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  now that's been replaced with cancel culture
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  and the entire
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  skateboarding industry now
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  and the community is
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:22.000]  they're just repeating lib turds stuff
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  and it's just totally
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  just some SJW
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  thing now that they're their own with
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:30.000]  so I'm glad that I'm not
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  affiliated with any of those corporate brands
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  like Nike or Supreme or anything
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  and they're not paying me because when
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:38.000]  they're giving you a check they have
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  they can tell you what to do and they can
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  you know pretty much make your
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  own ideas for you you've got to agree with them
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:46.000]  or they'll just cut you
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  Right, exactly. Alright, you're listening
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  to the Alex Jones show on your guest host

[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  why America has got to be taking down
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  you can't have all these other nations
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:40.000]  enslaved and America still quasi free
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  you can't have info wars has been proven
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:44.000]  right be on air with all the craziness

[3:33:02.000 --> 3:33:12.000]  alex jones show
[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:18.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show
[3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:20.000]  I'm your guest jdyer jason alex
[3:33:20.000 --> 3:33:22.000]  we were just talking about
[3:33:22.000 --> 3:33:24.000]  the way subcultures
[3:33:24.000 --> 3:33:26.000]  and counterculture groups and niches
[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:28.000]  are actually exploited and are
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:30.000]  steered or created in fact
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:32.000]  if you follow my work you know that I've covered
[3:33:32.000 --> 3:33:34.000]  the 1960s counterculture
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:36.000]  movements that were basically
[3:33:36.000 --> 3:33:38.000]  created and or steered by
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  the CIA into becoming
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:42.000]  a social engineering
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  tool of the big corporate elite we see
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:46.000]  that especially nowadays to pop
[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  culture when we look at the music videos
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:50.000]  we look at what's promoted
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  on purpose as a weapon it's all
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:54.000]  weaponized and I can tell you
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  that in other sub niches
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  and genres of the arts
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:00.000]  or even now as you see sports
[3:34:00.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  right we all see the NFL
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  being you know turned into this tool
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  for we saw it with
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  Obamacare right they were promoting Obamacare
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  at the Super Bowl years ago and then it turned
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  into the halftime show being this big
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:14.000]  basically satanic ritual
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:16.000]  and in the other sub niches
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  and cultures that have exploded and gotten
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:20.000]  tremendously popular like
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:22.000]  skateboarding we've seen the same
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  type of steering
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  and subversion I have another friend who is
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  a prominent comic book artist
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  and he's basically been squeezed out
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:32.000]  because the world of comic
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:34.000]  books is so
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  dogmatic with their
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  it's basically a holy office of
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:40.000]  inquisition that they have when it comes to
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:42.000]  how comic books can
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:44.000]  be drawn how they can be written you
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  have all of these you know
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  you can't do fat shaming or any of this
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  kind of stuff it controls
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:52.000]  the realm of comics and it's no different
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:54.000]  in the other domains like skateboarding
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:56.000]  and we have
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  you know again prominent skateboarder
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:00.000]  weking ball with us
[3:35:00.000 --> 3:35:02.000]  who built his own audience
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  built his own fan base and from the outset
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:06.000]  because he wasn't signed on to the
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  corporate establishment the corporate deals
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  and he was trolling
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  and the humor isn't
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:14.000]  really excessively
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:16.000]  you know gross or offensive
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:18.000]  or anything like that he just likes to troll people
[3:35:18.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  who like to have fun I think he's a really
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  funny guy and
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  he got basically
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:26.000]  blacklisted and so that's what they do is
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  that you get if you don't go along
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:30.000]  you get blacklisted and it's really the same in every domain
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  I was in the domain of
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  academia I wanted to be a professor
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:36.000]  you basically get blacklisted if you study
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:38.000]  you know how geopolitics works
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:40.000]  if you study the elite you study
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:42.000]  you know Carol Quigley this
[3:35:42.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  kind of stuff you get pushed out
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:46.000]  you're not welcome in the domain of academia
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:48.000]  and so let's go back to
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:50.000]  weking ball I want to ask you you were getting into
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:52.000]  that how that censorship worked where you're kind of
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:54.000]  pushed out and you know you
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  didn't get these deals and whatnot yet you still
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  you know were able to do what you were doing
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:00.000]  whoa who began
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:02.000]  the tech censorship with you because I noticed like
[3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:04.000]  three four years ago there's
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  you know interviews with you on YouTube with
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:08.000]  millions of views you're on some of the top
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  you know podcast
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  skateboarding podcast millions of views
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  and then what you got deleted from YouTube right
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  I didn't get deleted from YouTube I got
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:20.000]  demonetized and
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  their their explanation
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  for that was that I used
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  of because I had my
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:28.000]  account on on a monetized
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  settings and they said that I was
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  demonetized because I was using
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  footage that I did not own although
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  it was just footage of me that I filmed
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:38.000]  so I think they just made that up because
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:40.000]  they didn't want to say what I really did
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  wrong
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  so I the
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  the tech century censorship
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  that I've been
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  and I'm not a victim I don't want to
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  I'm not trying to come across like I'm a victim
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  I'm a victor I overcome this stuff
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  so
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:58.000]  but that's on Instagram mostly I mean
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:00.000]  I'm shadow ban I'm restricted I
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:02.000]  have over a hundred thousand followers
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  and I you know I used to do live videos
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  like they 500 to a thousand
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  people come on there now there's like 50 people
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:10.000]  so they're not even letting people know
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  that follows like people you know select
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  to follow me you would think that
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:16.000]  they're going to get notified of when you
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  make a post but they've got me
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  heavily restricted on there
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  so I mean I think maybe
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  the reason they do that is so that it's not
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  so obvious and I start taking off
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  about you know how I'm being
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  you know banned or whatever but
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  yeah it's just a little
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  game they're playing with me I guess
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:36.000]  but you saw this
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  you know when you and I
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  talked a couple weeks ago
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:42.000]  and you've got a podcast by the way
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  I recommend people watch your podcast over
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  on your Patreon if they want to support your work
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:48.000]  we were talking
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  about
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  the way that
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  these corporations kind of control
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  and then they sort they start slipping in the messages
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  right so it might begin with
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:00.000]  buying off the big skaters but then the big skaters
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  are expected to go along with
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  these these kind of agendas
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  that might even be darker and even more
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  occult again so you pointed out to me
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  that you started noticing in the domain
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  of skateboarding a lot of satanic imagery
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  a lot of all-seeing eyes a lot of
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  bath on that and occult type stuff
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  when did you start seeing that what do you think
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  was behind that right
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  yes and that's actually
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  for anybody watching that's how
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  you and I met was I did
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  a parody of the Alex Jones
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  show but it was called info boards
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  and I did
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:34.000]  a breakdown of the satanic imagery
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  and skateboarding we had you on
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  as our expert to
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  decode the symbols
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  so I first noticed that
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  and I'm sure even if people
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  don't know skateboarding all that well
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  and to those who are watching
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  who might be saying why do I care about
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:52.000]  skateboarding I don't skateboard I don't know
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  anyone at skateboards the point is that
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:56.000]  they're they're trying to cover every
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  single aspect of life
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:00.000]  and every community every subculture
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  that there there's no room left
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  to get away from this this agenda
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  you know what I mean so it's something as
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  as niche as skateboarding
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  they're in there so anyway
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  I firstly notice
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  that's the old one
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  that was the first one I did
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  two episodes of that my Alex
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:20.000]  costume got a little bit better
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  on the next one but
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  so the first time I noticed the
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  satanic satanic imagery
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  was of course with thrasher
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  magazine which people probably
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  have seen that logo that don't
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  skateboard they're facing it they
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  sure they've seen celebrities wearing
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  shirts of it or something like that but
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  it's literally a bathroom
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  with a pentagram on it and all
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  they did was just put skateboard wheels
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  on the end of the pentagram
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  so that was the first time I noticed that
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:50.000]  and then you know that a lot of those
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  brands they've been running for
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  years like the all seeing
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  I and everything like that
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  so it's like very heavy in the
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:00.000]  skateboarding fashion which
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:02.000]  also transcends skateboarding
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  wear skateboarding clothes
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  so many people wear skateboarding shoes
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  that don't skateboard if chances
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  are if somebody has tennis shoes today
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  they're skateboarding shoes
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:14.000]  yeah it's kind of like in the
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  you know past decade
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  a lot of style and fashion
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  that was popular in the punk genre
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  kind of spilled over into the mainstream
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  so they kind of mainstream
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  punk stuff I mean everybody having like
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  purple social justice warrior
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  haircuts is actually I don't punk
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  worlds I mean so and then you have
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:34.000]  a kind of a similar influence where
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  things from the skateboarding world kind of spill over
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  into the mainstream culture
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:40.000]  like you're talking about
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  and it was right around the same time
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  though that I remember like 5
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  6 even 10 years ago you would
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  start to see mainline fashion
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  beginning to really adopt that imagery
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:52.000]  you would go into just normal department stores
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  and you would see you know gigantic
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:56.000]  all seeing eye t-shirts
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  and you would see you know pop stars
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  wearing even the Jonas Brothers for example
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  even wearing t-shirts of Crowley
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.000]  so you can find the Jonas Brothers
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  from Disney right like wearing
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  Alistair Crowley giant faces of
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  Crowley like staring out at you right
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  and so that Disney and
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  pop culture and you know the
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  pop stars they had a huge role
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  in mainstreaming a lot of the satanic
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  and the baphomet
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  imagery that you're talking about
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  and it was right around the same time probably that the
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  skateboarding world did too and again
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  the point here is that it's not accidental
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  it's more like a top down thing
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  it's like people who are running
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  these corporations whether it's
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:36.000]  in the domain of music industry
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:38.000]  or where wherever it is
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  yeah there you go exactly
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  there's top down
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  really wealthy people who I believe
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  are actually into satanism
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  they're actually into this stuff they believe
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  that they're enacting a new
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  aeon a new era I just read a long
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  interview from a satanist
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  who died right before he died 10 years ago
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  and he was saying actually a lot of
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  things that would occur as
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  that we're seeing now especially with COVID
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  and all this stuff rolling out
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:06.000]  he was saying that's actually a satanic plan
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  so I don't know if you have any thoughts on that
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  do you see that what we're going into
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  as a new world order being a satanic plan
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  that's covering all the bases like you said
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  I absolutely think there is a plan
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:20.000]  for that and I totally agree with you on that
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  it's not an accident
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:24.000]  you know
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  that was me getting
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  a good read
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  in the mask
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  you got to do the face shield
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  there's only way
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  you can make sure you're safe in your house
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  should have doubled up at least
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  well I had
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  spectacles on too so I had double eye protection
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  for any droplets
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  you know
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  you got to watch out for those droplets
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  of flooding
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  no we were joking about Jersey Shore Wives
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  and I realized if Fauci actually
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  kind of has a Jersey Shore Wives

[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:37.000]  100 years to my knowledge
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  no one else has done that I have to
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:41.000]  toot my own horn a little bit here

[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:49.000]  are doing in terms
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:51.000]  of being the spearhead of the alternative
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  media and fighting the new world order so
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:55.000]  again to this global plan of the
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  new world order
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  you were talking about some of the
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  videos that you've been making trolling
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  you have a claus's book there
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:05.000]  when did you first hear about this idea
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:07.000]  of the plan for a global government
[3:48:07.000 --> 3:48:09.000]  a global reset is that something you heard about
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:11.000]  a long time ago through the counterculture
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  arena of skateboarding
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  or is that something that you kind of woke up to
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  more recently
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:19.000]  you know
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  I first heard about all this
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:23.000]  stuff years ago
[3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  I was in
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:27.000]  probably junior high school
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:29.000]  and I just got sucked into like one of those
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  YouTube vortexes
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:33.000]  when you start watching YouTube videos
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:35.000]  and you get suggestions and you keep going
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  deeper and deeper and deeper and I came across
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:39.000]  some documentaries I watched those
[3:48:39.000 --> 3:48:41.000]  they blew my mind and then I was thinking
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:43.000]  about it a lot and then as I
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  went about my life you know
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:47.000]  I got distracted and I kind of
[3:48:47.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  I kind of forgot about it
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:51.000]  next probably
[3:48:51.000 --> 3:48:53.000]  like 10 to 12 years
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  and I was just reminded again
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:57.000]  about this about like
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:48:59.000]  two and a half three years ago
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  about this plan so
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:03.000]  I've been you know more
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  and it's easier to
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:07.000]  to you know research now as the
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:09.000]  internet's gotten you know bigger and everything
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:11.000]  and there's more people that are putting out
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  your information about it
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  so
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:17.000]  yeah I've known about it for a long time
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  you know life happens
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:21.000]  I kind of got distracted and now
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:23.000]  we're back here and I'm
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:25.000]  learning all about the great reset
[3:49:25.000 --> 3:49:27.000]  and it's just it's a great idea
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:29.000]  I think we should all
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:31.000]  you know
[3:49:31.000 --> 3:49:33.000]  get rid of all of our
[3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:35.000]  our vehicles and get electric
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:37.000]  segways that we can ride
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:39.000]  every man should remove his penis
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:41.000]  every woman should have a penis
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:43.000]  it's all great
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:45.000]  yeah I've got an appointment scheduled
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  for my endocrinologist
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:49.000]  next week and then hopefully
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  he'll make sure that I'm infertile
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:53.000]  and you know that'll be good for
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:55.000]  Bill Gaines
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  real quick
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:49:59.000]  can I just shout out my buddy Dark Iron Gaines
[3:49:59.000 --> 3:50:01.000]  he actually he printed this out for me
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:03.000]  and this is a news article that you guys might have missed
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  this is when
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:07.000]  he used my back muscles
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:09.000]  to block out the sun
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:11.000]  because you know global warming and everything
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  and then he celebrated with
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  a nice warm of recycled
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:17.000]  human urine
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:19.000]  he was drinking that after
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  so that was very good
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  well we appreciate you and Bill
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  I'm gonna get those numbers down
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  I'm gonna be working with Wacking Ball
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:29.000]  and we're gonna get those numbers down
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  we're gonna block out the sun
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  and who else comes up with the crazy
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:35.000]  pause to block out the sun that's like
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  yeah that's some Batman
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:39.000]  villain stuff right there Superman villain
[3:50:39.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  he's a comic book villain and I don't know
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:43.000]  some people don't realize that
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:45.000]  well I saw it
[3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  so you have the book there and
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  I've got my class book sitting right here
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:51.000]  and you know it's amazing that
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:53.000]  they can put this stuff out in the open
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:55.000]  and I think that's I've always said that's part of
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  the gas lighting technique you know
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  is to put it in the open put it in your face
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  hidden in plain sight you know
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  and show everybody that this is what they're actually doing
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:05.000]  and what that does is it kind of has this
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  effect
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:09.000]  of putting people into a catatonic state
[3:51:09.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  they don't know what to do
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:13.000]  and they just accept it
[3:51:13.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  and they become apathetic oh well I guess there's nothing
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  we do about it because like he's a really
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:19.000]  rich dude and like he runs a bunch
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:21.000]  of business
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:23.000]  things so I guess he has to
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  tell us what to do right so it's just this
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:27.000]  default to authority like oh I guess
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:29.000]  you know we just follow whatever they
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:31.000]  say but you know the whole
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:33.000]  skating community was
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:35.000]  about not defaulting to authority right
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:37.000]  exactly
[3:51:37.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  there's actually a skateboarding trick
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  called a no comply
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  and I think we need to start doing that
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:45.000]  one more yeah skateboarding
[3:51:45.000 --> 3:51:47.000]  was totally again is totally
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:49.000]  was anti establishment
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:51.000]  like no no
[3:51:51.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  referees no you
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  nobody's telling you what to say and do
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:57.000]  how to dress how to
[3:51:57.000 --> 3:51:59.000]  everything like that and now
[3:51:59.000 --> 3:52:01.000]  every brand
[3:52:01.000 --> 3:52:03.000]  first of all the top brands in skateboarding now
[3:52:03.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  aren't even skateboarding brands their
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:07.000]  companies like Nike who bought their way
[3:52:07.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  into skateboarding because they offered
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:11.000]  the pro skaters
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  more money and and the pro skaters
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:15.000]  they you know weren't happy with having
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  a second job they wanted to be
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  like on this rock star status
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:21.000]  like Tony Hawk or
[3:52:21.000 --> 3:52:23.000]  like the very few that sold themselves
[3:52:23.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  out to these corporate brands
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:27.000]  they took the Nike check and now they're
[3:52:27.000 --> 3:52:29.000]  trapped and they need to be told
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:31.000]  what to do and say and they can't
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  have an opinion and you know
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:35.000]  it's when totally woke
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:37.000]  in the name of progressive
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:39.000]  pardon me progressivism
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:41.000]  they you know they got
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:43.000]  females on these skate teams
[3:52:43.000 --> 3:52:45.000]  but unfortunately they're not really females
[3:52:45.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  they're just guys in dresses
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:49.000]  so that's what they've done with that and
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:51.000]  I think it's just very goofy
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:53.000]  and it's just totally just
[3:52:53.000 --> 3:52:55.000]  it's made the whole
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  thing just just
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:52:59.000]  a huge joke and
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:01.000]  you know it's it's sad to see
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:03.000]  the women too
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:05.000]  supporting stuff like this it's like
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:07.000]  seems like it's very disrespectful
[3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  to themselves
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  yeah that's a great point I don't think
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:13.000]  people understand that you know
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  as I was reading this Satanist guys
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  last will and testament
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:19.000]  essay that he wrote before he passed away in
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  2010 he actually says pretty
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  honestly what all of this is about
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:25.000]  and he says that it's all an attack on everyone
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  no one's
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  excused from this it's an attack on
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:31.000]  women's attack on men
[3:53:31.000 --> 3:53:33.000]  and you know he even gleefully talks about
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:35.000]  how yes the western world's
[3:53:35.000 --> 3:53:37.000]  water supply has been poisoned
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:39.000]  exactly echoing what
[3:53:39.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  you get in people like
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  John P. Holder and Paul Ehrlich writing
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:45.000]  an eco science saying we need to drug the tap water
[3:53:45.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  it echoes exactly what
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  Bertrand Russell said Bertrand Russell said that
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:51.000]  you won't be reading Shakespeare you won't be
[3:53:51.000 --> 3:53:53.000]  reading the Bible and then just this week
[3:53:53.000 --> 3:53:55.000]  we had universities in Canada
[3:53:55.000 --> 3:53:57.000]  earning books literally out of fahrenheit
[3:53:57.000 --> 3:53:59.000]  451 the famous dystopian
[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:01.000]  novel
[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:03.000]  literally saying you can't read these texts
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:05.000]  they're banned now so they've
[3:54:05.000 --> 3:54:07.000]  reinstituted banning which everybody
[3:54:07.000 --> 3:54:09.000]  I thought we were but we believed in free
[3:54:09.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  speech something like that right but no now
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:13.000]  books are banned books are burned
[3:54:13.000 --> 3:54:15.000]  you can't talk about this you can't
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:17.000]  they are intentionally
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  dumbing people down
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  there's this interview with this
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:23.000]  essay that the Satanist wrote before he died
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:25.000]  in 2010 he says we will
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  reduce the western population
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  by about he says 60 or 70%
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  by 2030 and we will have
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:33.000]  the western world being almost
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:35.000]  illiterate by
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  2021 so here we are in 2021
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  10 years after he wrote his essay
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  and I would say that yeah the western
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  world is almost
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  functionally speaking illiterate like people
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:47.000]  can't read they can't do logic they can't
[3:54:47.000 --> 3:54:49.000]  think they can't figure out
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  what's going on when there's
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  like 50 plus 100
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:55.000]  plus books written explaining
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  what's going on from the people doing it
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:01.000]  yeah you were talking about gas
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  lighting and that's you know their go to
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:05.000]  and
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  it seems like basically the
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  the way they do
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:11.000]  you know they do their rollouts for these
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:13.000]  these ideas and these
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:15.000]  policies is
[3:55:15.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  it's they hint at
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:19.000]  it people start talking about it
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  and then those people are conspiracy
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  theorists and they're crazy
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  and then once it comes true
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  then they flip to oh this is actually
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  a good idea for us we should do this
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  and they convince you that it's a great idea
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  that's what they did with the great reset
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  you know 15 months ago
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  that was a conspiracy theory the great
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:39.000]  reset now there's a book called
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  COVID-19 the great reset
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:43.000]  by Klaus Schwab so
[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  yeah that's what they do and
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:47.000]  if I can jump back to real quick you
[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:49.000]  mentioned the water being contaminated
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  I just recently did a video for my
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:53.000]  Patreon I was explaining how I believe
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:55.000]  that TRT is a trap to get
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  you dependent on synthetic hormones
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:55:59.000]  from the
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  pharmacy and I covered the
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  one of the ways that's lowering
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:05.000]  men's testosterone is that the water
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:07.000]  is poisoned and you know
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  of course everybody knows about Alex
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  and his viral comment about the frogs
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:13.000]  and that's true there's a chemical
[3:56:13.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  in the water called atrazine
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:17.000]  it was given to frogs and 30
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:19.000]  40% of them were unable to reproduce
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:21.000]  some of them
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:23.000]  had given high doses actually
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:25.000]  the male frogs then
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  developed female
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:29.000]  reproductive system and started
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:31.000]  getting pregnant so
[3:56:31.000 --> 3:56:33.000]  yeah
[3:56:33.000 --> 3:56:35.000]  they have
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:37.000]  80% of the tap water
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:39.000]  in the United States contains
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:41.000]  30 times more atrazine
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  that was given to those frogs
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  so people want to wonder why
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:47.000]  their test is low
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:49.000]  and why that's such a problem with America today
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:51.000]  that's a huge reason
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  right there
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:55.000]  exactly and keep in mind
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:56:57.000]  this is not a new idea it's actually
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:56:59.000]  mentioned by many of the global elite
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  back before even Erlich it's mentioned
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  by Kessler it's mentioned by Bertrand Rossell
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:05.000]  they all talk about poisoning
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:07.000]  the food and the water to socially
[3:57:07.000 --> 3:57:09.000]  engineered dumb down mutate
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:11.000]  the population Jonah Salk
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:13.000]  all of these guys who are part of that
[3:57:13.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  global elite club have talked about this for ages
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:17.000]  well we're coming to the end of the interview
[3:57:17.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  I want to thank you so much for coming on
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:21.000]  anything you want to tell us leave us with
[3:57:21.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  remind everybody where they can follow you
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:45.000]  and I'll see you in the second ball
