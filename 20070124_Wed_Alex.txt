[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:42.000 --> 00:50.000]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  We're going in. We're going in full throttle.
[01:05.000 --> 01:14.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm glad that you've decided to join us today. It is the 24th day of January, 2007.
[01:16.000 --> 01:24.000]  And before I go any further, let me tell you that we have Ed Brown joining us.
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  He was holed up in his home in New Hampshire, found guilty of tax evasion.
[01:30.000 --> 01:43.000]  And in the past, they send in armored SWAT teams to murder anyone who resists the private collection agency for the private banks that own us as chattel slaves.
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  The people of the country are rapidly learning that the Federal Reserve is private.
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  They are rapidly learning that even Alan Greenspan wrote a book admitting it in 1966. I'd said 1968.
[01:56.000 --> 02:05.000]  It was Capitalism, the Unrealized Dream, 1966. I'd read it years ago, I'd mentioned it, and I now have found the book.
[02:06.000 --> 02:16.000]  People are learning that our government is criminal and funded at Mao Tse Tung, Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin, and Adolf Eloise Hitler.
[02:16.000 --> 02:24.000]  The people are learning that the entire economic system is a fraud and a matrix-level lie.
[02:25.000 --> 02:36.000]  And they're getting angrier and angrier and angrier. We are going to win. We are going all the way.
[02:37.000 --> 02:49.000]  So Alberto Gonzalez and Viet Dinh and Fox News and the CIA, CNN can try to put their New World Order back together again,
[02:49.000 --> 02:58.000]  but all of your pomps and pimps and minions and viceroys and duchies are not going to be able to resurrect your system.
[02:58.000 --> 03:07.000]  Oh, your system's a train of its own momentum that's going to roll into the station, but it's going to be dead on arrival.
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  So coming up in the second hour from his home, holed up in New Hampshire, Ed Brown will join us.
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  And for those that don't know about this case, we'll re-air that local Fox News clip coming up in the next segment.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  The number two former head of the Treasury Department, chief economist for Ronald Reagan, the father of Reaganomics,
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  who's gone public saying clearly terrorism is predominantly an inside job,
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  has written another incredible editorial that's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:40.000 --> 03:47.000]  The empire turns its guns on its own citizenry. We'll be going over that report.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  Also, we'll discuss the ridiculous State of the Union that we witnessed last night.
[03:53.000 --> 04:02.000]  And also, I had Aaron Russo coming on tomorrow. He has his ups and downs days, I'm just going to put it at that.
[04:02.000 --> 04:10.000]  He's very tough, four years battling cancer, a bunch of surgeries, and I'm not going to go into any more detail.
[04:11.000 --> 04:19.000]  But I had him scheduled for tomorrow, but I'm seeing if we can get him on today with Ed Brown,
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  because when I learned of this, what was happening with Ed Brown a few days ago in New Hampshire,
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  I had a sneaking suspicion that freedom to fascism, American freedom to fascism,
[04:31.000 --> 04:40.000]  was really one of the final straws that caused this man to say, this far and no further.
[04:40.000 --> 04:48.000]  Talking to him this morning, we indeed learned that not only is it one of the main things that's pushing him to stand up,
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  he was obviously already aware of the crime syndicate and its activities,
[04:51.000 --> 05:01.000]  but the thousands of phone calls and letters and support and people coming to Mr. Lewis's and Mrs. Lewis's, it's Ed Lewis Brown's home,
[05:01.000 --> 05:10.000]  is young people, college and high school students, and it's because of American freedom to fascism.
[05:10.000 --> 05:20.000]  Another testament to lone resistance having huge effects as he battled cancer, as he went through surgeries,
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.000]  as he went through hellish treatments, he didn't tell anybody, he was fighting for his life when he made that movie,
[05:27.000 --> 05:36.000]  and it's just unbelievable that it's having this huge effect. God bless Aaron Russo. We'll be right back.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  It's here, after a year introduction and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[05:46.000 --> 05:54.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[05:54.000 --> 06:02.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British Intelligence.
[06:02.000 --> 06:11.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture,
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.000]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[06:14.000 --> 06:20.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[07:37.000 --> 07:47.000]  Attention! Attention everyone! A brand new invention just released. It's called WristEase, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[07:47.000 --> 07:54.000]  WristEase comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse, or adding machine.

[08:08.000 --> 08:23.000]  WristEase is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games. WristEase provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and WristEase provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[08:23.000 --> 08:36.000]  You can order WristEase now at WristEase.com. That's WristEase, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, WristEase.com. Once again, WristEase.com.
[08:39.000 --> 08:49.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:49.000 --> 09:01.000]  All right, Ed Brown of the New Hampshire, found guilty of tax evasion, is waiting for an armored SWAT team to try to move in against him.
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  And they do this every day in this country for the private banks that own America.
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  And we had Aaron Russo coming on tomorrow for a full hour to talk about solutions and how to support Ron Paul.
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  He is an incredible fighter, but I'm not going to lie to the listeners. He had surgery a few weeks ago.
[09:21.000 --> 09:31.000]  He's got to, looks like, I just talked to him, he's not doing too well. He's got to go in for surgery again. He's at the hospital right now.
[09:31.000 --> 09:43.000]  And it just, it's so poignant that he wasn't complaining, he wasn't telling anybody how sick he was when he made America freedom to fascism.
[09:44.000 --> 09:54.000]  And everything he did to get that film promoted and just all the stuff behind the scenes that I know about that I really can't share with you.
[09:54.000 --> 10:04.000]  But to see that film now spreading all over the web, people getting the DVD, making copies, showing it at parties, showing it at groups.
[10:04.000 --> 10:11.000]  Finally, everything that we've been pushing all these years to expose, the Federal Reserve, the IRS, its collection agency,
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  the North American Union, it's really spreading like wildfire right now.
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.000]  And I hope you'll go to Infowars.com and get your copy of America Freedom to Fascism on DVD.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  If you haven't gotten it, you need to get it.
[10:28.000 --> 10:39.000]  It is so important to get that film out to everyone and we're going to have Ed Lewis Brown on with us coming up in the second hour today.
[10:39.000 --> 10:48.000]  I hope to have Aaron on with him because of the thousands of people that are contacting Mr. Brown, the hundreds that are coming there to support him.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  Most of them are bringing up America Freedom to Fascism.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  This is a new crop of people that have awoken.
[10:54.000 --> 11:01.000]  People see the local news demonizing him and they rally knowing it's propaganda to his support.
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  And there's a whole other facet to this that you've got somebody who just says, fine, this is far no further.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  You want to come take my house, you want to come in here, I've got guns and I'm going to defend myself and I'm ready to die.
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  I'm tired of the tyranny.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  Fine, you just go ahead, you come kill me in cold blood and then you see what that starts.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  Just like in V for Vendetta when they gun that little girl down in the back.
[11:25.000 --> 11:36.000]  And all you punks and all you bullies out there that work for this system and who hate this country, you are just, let me just tell you, time's running out for you.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  You see, all these years I've studied history and I know that tyrants always tell the people they can't win.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  Tyrants always tell us we don't have power.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  Tyrants always tell us we can't affect change.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  Tyrants always tell us that you can't beat City Hall.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  It's a fraud.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  They're scared to death of us and they should be.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  They should be.
[11:58.000 --> 12:05.000]  Because they know history and they know when their tyranny gets pushed too far, when push comes to shove, the people stand up.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  Especially the American people.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  We may have been fat, dumb and happy and a lot of people have gone beyond the point of no return and you can't wake them up and you won't wake them up.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  No matter how many evil things this global crime syndicate posing as our government does.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  But they don't count.
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  The furniture that sits there in the bleachers, a bunch of drooling spectators don't count.
[12:30.000 --> 12:42.000]  What counts is people who are in the arena and 5%, really 2% started the war with the British when they pushed and we pushed back and 5% won that war.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  Let me tell you right now, we've got a lot more than 5%.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  We've got a lot more than 5%.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  The key here is taking this country back in an orderly fashion.
[12:55.000 --> 13:03.000]  Because believe me, the globalists have plans to let a violent revolution kick off which will burn out of control and they'll come in and mop up the pieces.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  We don't want violence.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  We don't want calamity.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  We don't want breakdown.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  We don't want dead cops laying all over the street.
[13:13.000 --> 13:37.000]  To the people in the system and those taking all this FEMA and BATF training, do you have any idea how many millions of veterans and former special forces soldiers and black operators are just sitting there running their businesses, running their construction businesses, their pool businesses, their car dealerships, their restaurants.
[13:37.000 --> 13:46.000]  I mean these are mainstream people just waiting with arsenals of guns, practicing, ready, ready for you fools when you try to crack down on the American people.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  I'm trying to keep you from stepping on a bear trap here.
[13:51.000 --> 13:58.000]  I'm trying to avert hundreds of thousands of you stupid minions getting your heads blown off.
[13:58.000 --> 14:12.000]  Because let me tell you something, the New World Order plans to send you in in the first martial law waves that can go on for several years and have you completely depleted and chewed to pieces before they bring in their foreign merc armies.
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  They're already integrating into our military force.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  So that's the bottom line.
[14:20.000 --> 14:29.000]  I'm your friend, but I don't sit here and tickle your ears and I don't sit here and smile at you like your crime bosses do, propaganda at you.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  I talk to you straight.
[14:33.000 --> 14:40.000]  I have enough respect for people to talk to them straight and that's what I do here on air, six days a week.
[14:41.000 --> 14:53.000]  And I'm begging everybody out there listening to get your heads screwed on straight and to realize that we're at a major crossroads in human history.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  In the long march, in the saga that is humanity.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  There is so much news here in front of me today.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  This morning I was thinking, where do I start? What do I cover?
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  And I think I'm going to go here first.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  Hundreds deported after L.A. sweep.
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.000]  The feds are reporting that 761 people were arrested in a five county region since January 17th.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  More than 450 have already been removed from the country according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  They're Polish, they're Mexican, they're German, they're Japanese, they're Iranian.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  And every few months they arrest 500-1000 people.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  It's always 500 or 700 or 1100.
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  You average it around to 700, but this latest sweep is 761 they say.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  And people say, oh look, the government's finally doing something about the open borders and illegal immigration.
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  Folks, there's conservatively 30 million illegal aliens, but let's take the government's estimate of 14 million off the 2000 census.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  As if the illegal aliens come to the door and tell the census bureau how many people are in the house.
[16:13.000 --> 16:20.000]  14 million, so that means if a thousand were arrested a day, not a thousand every three or four months,
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  that's what they're doing, in dog and pony, show, staged events.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  If a thousand were arrested a day, that'd be 365,000 in a year.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  Now they admit, the feds admit, 3 million new illegal immigrants come in each year with close to 900,000 legal immigrants.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  So we're talking close to 4 million new people, and if they arrested a thousand a day, that'd be 365,000.
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.000]  And if they arrested a thousand a day, that'd be 365,000.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  That'd be like if you had a giant hole in your rowboat and it was sinking and was going to sink in 60 seconds,
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  and you had a thimble trying to bail.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  That's your dog and pony show.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  That's your dog and pony show, right there.
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  And it's fooling a lot of people.
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  They've got Limbaugh and Hannity and all the rest of these people on talk radio every day saying,
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  Look how Bush is getting tough.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.000]  You want him to get tough on immigration? He is.
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  Meanwhile, this is all just a prelude to Bush trying to sign the amnesty plan,
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  which will end all of this and just legalize everyone,
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  as long as they go register and get their new regional North American ID card, and that's what it is.
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  It isn't just the American people under the Real ID Act where they're federalizing and standardizing all the driver's licenses and ID cards.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  You have to have one to have a job, an internal passport.
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.000]  If you read, it is a North American ID card,
[17:50.000 --> 17:56.000]  with Social Security paid to Canada and Mexico out of our Treasury.
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.000]  So that's what's really happening there, and I want to be clear about something here.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  I care about Eastern European immigrants.
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  I care about Latin American immigrants.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  I care about Asian immigrants.
[18:14.000 --> 18:15.000]  I care about African immigrants.
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.000]  I care about these people.
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  But they live in conquered New World Order nations.
[18:21.000 --> 18:25.000]  They live in nations where they're forcibly inoculated under UN programs and forcibly sterilized.
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  They live in countries where the IMF and World Bank have taken control of their governments and blown out their economies by design.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  We have the IMF World Bank documents, internal documents since 2002,
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  when Joseph Stiglitz went public, Nobel Prize winner, chief economist.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  He said here they're doing it all by design.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  They have wrecked the Third World.
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  They've ensured it couldn't get on its feet.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  These are global monopoly men.
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  They want no one to be independent, from the family right up to the state government, right up to the federal level.
[18:58.000 --> 19:02.000]  And the very same people that are feeding on the Third World and then generating the need for these poor people,
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.000]  these desperate people to flood here wanting a better life for their children.
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.000]  The New World Order is cynically using them to literally sink our lifeboat.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  It's like having a lifeboat with a hundred people in it.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  It can hold a hundred.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  And there are ten thousand trying to climb into it.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  And people look at me and say, oh, you're being mean.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  You don't like immigrants.
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  No, I care about these people.
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.000]  I care about humanity.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  I have empathy.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  I understand what they've been through.
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  I realize the attack they're under.
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  I know they just want a better life.
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  I understand that.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  But you can't put ten thousand people in a lifeboat that holds a hundred.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  They're already swarming up over the sides.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  The front of the boat's already going under.
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.000]  And if we don't bail and stop these people from climbing over, we're going down into the North Atlantic Sea.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  Into the frigid, sub-zero waters.
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.000]  This is the reality.
[20:10.000 --> 20:15.000]  I'm just here giving you the Machiavellian analysis of what they're doing.
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  This is the cold hard facts.
[20:18.000 --> 20:24.000]  That evil figurehead, George Bush, wants total open borders and unlimited illegal aliens.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  And it isn't because he wants to, quote, help America.
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  It's because the globalists want to kill this country.
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  And they're doing a darn good job of it.
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  We'll be right back.
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[20:43.000 --> 20:49.000]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[20:50.000 --> 21:00.000]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[21:13.000 --> 21:23.000]  Moreover, because they are re-cleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[21:24.000 --> 21:31.000]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $1.88 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  That's triple 8, 803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[21:40.000 --> 21:47.000]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[21:48.000 --> 21:56.000]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first Communist dictator, B.I. Lenin, on them.
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.000]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.
[22:07.000 --> 22:15.000]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.000]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[22:55.000 --> 23:04.000]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933,
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  some precious metals holdings are subject to government intervention.
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  1-800-686-2237.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[23:42.000 --> 23:51.000]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.000]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[23:58.000 --> 24:04.000]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed Inc.'s patented methodology.
[24:05.000 --> 24:16.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  Laser technology at its best.

[24:25.000 --> 24:32.000]  Or, visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  Call 702-953-026.
[24:37.000 --> 24:52.000]  Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'll like to catch.
[24:53.000 --> 25:04.000]  The man he's playing Dixie, the man at his hand-out stress, could be the fuhrer, could be the bloke of grief.
[25:07.000 --> 25:14.000]  Well, there's sometimes a reason, you know, we come as a man of peace.
[25:14.000 --> 25:21.000]  You got sweet gifts of gas, you got harmonious time.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  So it'll be a song of love that never has been sung, but the intentions can be evolved.
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  Oh, this can be fun and breezy.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  Welcome back.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  Several program notes, my producer got this backwards.
[25:39.000 --> 25:50.000]  We've got Ed Lewis Brown from New Hampshire holed up, ready to fight to the death to defend against the private enforcers of the central banks that own us as slaves.
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.000]  Literally, they say they do.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  They got another thing coming, we're revolting, it is a slave revolt.
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.000]  At the same time, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts will be joining us to talk about his article,
[26:02.000 --> 26:09.000]  the empire that turns its guns on its own citizenry, or the empire turns its guns on its own citizenry.
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  There's a new story out just today, up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  We'll have open phones coming up later in this hour, toll-free number to join us.
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.000]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  And again, I haven't plugged this yet, I should have.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  I've forgotten about it, so much happening.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  I'm going to be on with George Norrie for the last two hours of his Friday show this week.
[26:39.000 --> 26:46.000]  He's going to be in Austin, Texas for Talk Fest coming up Saturday at the Austin Convention Center with Neil Bortz and others.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  But I'm going to be in studio with him, co-hosting the second two hours.
[26:53.000 --> 27:00.000]  He's got Carol Mote and Hal, I guess the first two hours, co-hosting with him, coming up Friday.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  And usually he invites me then to Talk Fest, I don't know if he is, I'm not too worried about that.
[27:07.000 --> 27:12.000]  And then coming up Sunday night, right after I do my new Sunday syndicated show from 4 to 6 p.m.
[27:13.000 --> 27:21.000]  from 8 to 10 p.m. at the massive, independently-owned, gigantic book people bookstore, and they've got some videos.
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  I mean, it's a giant, I don't know what, three-story bookstore, it's just humongous.
[27:27.000 --> 27:37.000]  And at the little bitty Waterloo a few months ago, we had like 200 people show up for the two hours I was there and they sold out of Terror Storm.
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  This is the only other signing I'm planning to do, this was set up months ago for Terror Storm.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  And they tried to get me to go to New York and Chicago and places and do it, I'm just too busy.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  But I've said I'd do it here in Austin because I'd like to meet you and talk to you.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.000]  So I'm going to give a speech, I think I'll give a speech on the New World Order Master Plan, get into some more facets of it.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  And then I'll take questions and sign DVDs for an hour.
[28:00.000 --> 28:10.000]  That's this coming Sunday night, I don't know what day is that, if it's Wednesday and it's the 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, I guess it's the 28th.
[28:10.000 --> 28:19.000]  That's Sunday the 28th, so it booked people in downtown Austin off 6th and Lamar.
[28:20.000 --> 28:29.000]  You cannot miss it, they've got a six-story parking garage, let me see it's three or four stories underground and a couple above ground.
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  Big parking garage, it's right by Whole Foods, the biggest organic and best organic, it's the mother ship where Whole Foods was founded, it's nationwide.
[28:37.000 --> 28:44.000]  They're a big model store, the biggest organic grocery store in the world, I'm told, is right next door.
[28:45.000 --> 28:52.000]  So you can kind of make an event out of it, you can go have dinner if you want, right there at Whole Foods, I don't know, 15 restaurants or something, it's ridiculous.
[28:53.000 --> 29:05.000]  And then you can come over to book people next door, it's in the old Whole Foods building, and you can come over there and I'll give a speech and do all that stuff.
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.000]  So I look forward to seeing you this Sunday night, 8 to 10 p.m.
[29:12.000 --> 29:21.000]  Like I said, make an evening, bring your husband or wife or girlfriend or boyfriend out to the event, bring your family out to the event, bring your neighbors out to the event.
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  I'll have some of the other films and books there as well.
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  And details are up on Infowars.com, they're going up on Infowars.com, I just told the webmaster about it last night.
[29:35.000 --> 29:44.000]  Also, I'm tentatively going out to the thing next month in Arizona, the big 9-11 thing, but we'll see, I'm trying to work the details out.
[29:45.000 --> 29:55.000]  It's kind of hard because I do a Sunday radio show, so anytime I go do something, I have to fly back to get on air on Sunday, so it's like, leave Friday, talk Saturday, fly back, but we're working that out.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  Okay, those program notes are now out of the way.
[30:00.000 --> 30:03.000]  I'm going to come back, I'm going to run over some of the war news, state of the union news.
[30:04.000 --> 30:10.000]  And I want to, well first I want to finish up with the immigrants, finish up discussing what's really behind that and how that's operating.
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  I forgot, that's what I was going to come back and talk about.
[30:14.000 --> 30:19.000]  So we shall return on the other side of this quick break.
[30:20.000 --> 30:26.000]  PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com, Infowars.net, or just some of the websites, check them out today.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:37.000 --> 30:38.000]  How are you feeling today?
[30:39.000 --> 30:45.000]  I ask because if you have health challenges, then reading our free booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[30:46.000 --> 30:50.000]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call mangosteen.
[30:50.000 --> 30:56.000]  It's a centuries old medicinal fruit whose time has come and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[30:57.000 --> 31:01.000]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potentials of this amazing fruit.
[31:02.000 --> 31:08.000]  This powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over with health concerns just like yours.
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  You can have the 22-page ebook lit absolutely free.
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  We'll also refer you a website with links to actual testimonials and product information.
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  Could this fruit help you in your quest for total health?
[31:20.000 --> 31:27.000]  Find out why mangosteen is known as the queen of all fruits and why it is fast becoming the best-selling wellness product ever brought to the market.
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  Your health is in your hands. Do something about it today.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  Call 800-681-1909. Again, that's 800-681-1909.
[31:37.000 --> 31:42.000]  It's a fact. You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[31:48.000 --> 31:51.000]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[31:52.000 --> 31:59.000]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[32:00.000 --> 32:06.000]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[32:07.000 --> 32:09.000]  We also do credit restoration.
[32:10.000 --> 32:15.000]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[32:20.000 --> 32:28.000]  Call Day of Jubilee. Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[32:29.000 --> 32:37.000]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert. Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.

[55:14.000 --> 55:19.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Continuing with open phone calls for the bottom of the next hour when Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us.
[55:20.000 --> 55:26.000]  Then we've got the man who is holed up in his house in New Hampshire, Ed Lewis Brown, because the IRS is saying they're coming to get him.

[56:22.000 --> 56:35.000]  1-888-253-3139. Or you can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[56:36.000 --> 56:43.000]  All right. Let's go ahead. Let me answer. She obviously knows about this. She said a wrong name, though. That's why I was confused.
[56:44.000 --> 56:55.000]  Well, I know reading Julius Caesar's The Battle for Gaul and several other Roman history books written by emperors and others, and they wrote these themselves, it was a compilation of letters to the Roman Senate.
[56:56.000 --> 57:05.000]  What he would do over 2,000 years ago is when they were, well, they had the Austrians working for them. They'd already conquered Austria.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  So they were going into Germania. They were going into Germany, into France, into Gaul and fighting these tribes.
[57:12.000 --> 57:22.000]  And so they would come up to these, some of those cities even had crude walls. I'm digressing. It doesn't really matter.
[57:22.000 --> 57:33.000]  And they would say, we will kill you. We will kill all your men and all your boys if you do not submit right now.
[57:34.000 --> 57:45.000]  If you do submit, we'll just take your older men and enslave them and take some of your younger men and put them into the training to be as kind of backup for the Roman legions.
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.000]  They wouldn't actually be part of the Roman legions and to be used against the next tribe.
[57:51.000 --> 57:56.000]  And if they didn't submit, they would kill everyone sometimes, including all, but usually they couldn't help themselves.
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  They wanted the women for slaves, sex slaves, house slaves, so forth and so on.
[58:02.000 --> 58:08.000]  They'd take some of the bigger young boys and then train them, and they were part of the patrarian guard who wore the blue, who protected the Caesar.
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  That's why you get the blue uniforms of police today.
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  Kind of a navy blue, but again I'm digressing.
[58:16.000 --> 58:23.000]  And he talked about how if he would threaten the city to kill all the children, the women would start rioting and the men would tend to listen to them and capitulate.
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  A lot of times they'd go ahead and kill them anyways.
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  So that's what happened.
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.000]  And I read other Roman history books about how they controlled slaves.
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  And what they do at a slave camp, when they brought in new slaves,
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  and see some of the younger men who they kept alive, 10, 15 years old,
[58:42.000 --> 58:47.000]  were starting fights, stabbing people, biting Roman guards, enforcers on the plantations.
[58:49.000 --> 58:54.000]  I'll continue on the other side, is they would take those young men and they'd kill them.
[58:56.000 --> 59:01.000]  And they'd tell the women, it's your job to enforce on them, it's your job to report on them, it's your job to control the men.
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  Or we're going to kill your children.
[59:05.000 --> 59:09.000]  And so the women would become the most brutal foremen and enforcers and tattletales.
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  The house slaves.
[59:12.000 --> 59:13.000]  The house slaves.
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  Which we'll pick up there.
[59:17.000 --> 59:25.000]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  You can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water.
[59:37.000 --> 59:40.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron,
[59:46.000 --> 59:49.000]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[59:50.000 --> 59:53.000]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[59:54.000 --> 59:58.000]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons, or one year, with tons and water.
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  Facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  What about you?
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for a special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  We are now into hour number two. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is joining us to talk about a new editorial he's written,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  The Empire Turns Its Guns on the Citizenry.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Then the man holed up at his house, convicted by the IRS of not paying to the private banks, to the Federal Reserve,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  and making a stand. He is coming up in the third hour.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  We'll have open phones for Patrick, Nathaniel, Manuel, Greg, Greg, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  A lady called in earlier and wanted me to talk about slave management techniques from Rome.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  And I was discussing that, how they would kill children, young men, in front of the mothers,
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  and tell them, now it's your job to keep them all in line when we take you to the plantations,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  or once they got to the plantations in Rome and surrounding areas,
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  or when they took them to sell them on slave ships to different countries.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  It's your job to keep them in line, or we'll kill more of your children.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  So the women would become just these incredible enforcers on their own people.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  So you think the black women being brought into the house in the U.S., or in the colonial U.S., or in the Caribbean,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  there's nothing new under the sun.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  This was old slave management techniques that were used by the Romans,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  and then previously by others they were developed.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  The first big group this was used on was white northern Europeans and central Europeans by other whites,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  the Romans, who themselves were pretty Germanic up until that time,
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  but then more of the Mediterranean peoples moved in, more slaves were brought in,
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  and so you get the Roman mix with quite a bit of Asian now, and even African in your average Italian.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  Just side issue, continuing with what happened here,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  then it came out in a few newspapers, that's how I saw it, and I actually went and pulled it up online.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  It was about six, seven years ago, I went to the library and got a copy of it.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  It was a book written even, it was right after the Revolutionary War,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  and it was talking about slave uprisings, some of the first ones in the Carolinas and other areas, black slaves.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  And an American went and got a group of books that were circulating in Spanish and Portuguese,
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  in the Caribbean, on the sugar plantations for making rum, on how they controlled black slaves.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  A handful of whites controlling a whole bunch of black slaves.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  And it's the same thing, the slave boat would pull up, and they would sell the slaves,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  and people would tend to buy them in groups, most people would have known slaves.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  The plantations would buy some slaves, and they would then buy a whole bunch of women, and men, and children,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  and they would bring them in to the plantation, and they would get them all up there,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  and they would claim that the biggest, strongest, smartest, whoever seemed to be the leader, black male,
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  would then be taken and cat-or-nined or beaten with an axe handle until they died.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  Might go on for hours with a cat-or-nine ripping up in their flesh down to the bone.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  And then they would take a small child and beat them, but not kill them,
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  and it says how to do this, and makes little snickering jokes the whole time,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  and talks about how the Romans did this, and that's where this comes from,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  and how then, how you tell the women, and of course most of these plantation owners couldn't even speak the African,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  a bunch of different African dialects, they would have already their house women,
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  who might be one, two, three generations, going around with a bullwhip themselves.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  And so they would be there telling the different African groups that were there,
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  you don't do exactly what we say, it's going to be your fault if you don't keep the men in line.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  They would tell the women that you're going to be the enforcers.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  And so we move forward to the plantations here in the United States,
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  and that's where you get the big black mammy, you know, the image of Aunt Jemima,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  and believe me, my dad grew up in cotton farming, folks, that's exactly how it operated.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  And they even had the big black women out there telling the white workers what to do.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  Some six foot four black woman beat you upside the head.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  And that's Oprah Winfrey.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands,
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British Intelligence.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  the White House program to disseminate fake news,
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  NSA spying, secret police torture,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terror also.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  Good morning, honey.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Yeah.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel perky system.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  Honey, cheer up. I brought our sport perky purifiers.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  What?
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria,
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water,
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  so I packed our sport perky purifiers.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  You know, this is a terrific cabin.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  And wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?

[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough,
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  As a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.

[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  Okay.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  And I'm not trying to attack Oprah Winfrey.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  She does some good stuff.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  My point is she pushes an agenda that's anti-male.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  Every show, men are basically bad.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  They abuse women. They're evil.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  And certainly there are bad men out there.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  But it goes back to the Romans.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  They would set the women up over the slaves, the slave women.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  They'd bring them into the house.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  They were the trusted people.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  And they told them in this culture, you suppress your own men for their own good so we don't punish them or flog them or kill them.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  And that moved into the plantations, the sugar cane plantations all over the Caribbean.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Then those same Roman books were adapted, changed, put into English in the colonies and into the United States.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  And then in the 1960s, blacks are wanting their freedom, they're wanting equality.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  And what's the government do?
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  Oh yeah, we'll help you.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  We'll give money to your women.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  And back then, you had very low black illegitimacy.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  Well, it was only like 30-something percent.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  Now it's over 90 percent.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  91 percent last time I checked.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  And pretty good in just 35 years because those numbers, it's been over 90 percent for over a decade now.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  Whites, by the way, now have over half illegitimacy.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  So they're doing a great job on whites as well.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  Social engineering works like a dandy.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  The government is, everybody always says the government's a bunch of buffoons and can't get anything right.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  They can shoot cruise missiles down chimneys when you put satellites up in orbit with perfect precision.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  What are you talking about?
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  It's a little bureaucracy, you can't get anything done, but that's by design too.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  All right, but let me continue.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  So, it's called red tape.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  So they would bring black women into the house, but that wasn't just black women, that was an old Roman system.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  And they would set them up as the rulers and as the enforcers.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  And a black woman could walk with her back straight and her shoulders up.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  But black men would get beaten or attacked if they didn't look down at the ground.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  You know, 80-year-old men got called boy, they would stay in the barn, they weren't allowed to learn how to read.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  Nothing.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  And, of course, the black women, and this isn't all of them, but this is what the house black women, this was the,
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  I mean, you've seen the old movies, you've read the old literature, you've read the old accounts,
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  running around telling everybody what to do because they were put in positions of petty power.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  And that's what the cops are today.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  You know, because the cops think it's all for our own good, society's about to fall apart,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  which, yeah, because your bosses are engineering it and it's a thin blue line and we've got to defend the state and order
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  and you've got to do all these things and treat everybody like slaves for their own good.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  That's all it is.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  That's all that's happening.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  This stuff was worked out a long time ago by empires and controllers and social engineers
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  and complex cities and buildings and structures and aqueducts and charted the oceans.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  I mean, these elites developed all of this and now we're here in 2007 and it's pretty darn sophisticated.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  Very, very sophisticated.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  And so you look at black men today and you see extremely intelligent, upright, successful examples of black men out there,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  but then obviously you see the stereotypical and same in the whites now, pants hanging down around their ankles,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  walking around, you know, the media and the culture telling them it's cool to basically act like animals,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  to be stupid, to not be informed, to basically have a life of crime.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  And this is being sold, this hoodlumism.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  And you've got black mothers, you know, who have all these children.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  This is how they were raised.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  And the black men, I mean, I remember growing up, you know, suburb of Dallas,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  and I played football and other sports and I went to a school that I was about 25, 30 percent black
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  and I tended to, you know, I had a lot of friends, but I tended to gravitate towards blacks.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  I mean, I was friends with blacks.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  And I went over to their houses on the weekend and I went on trips and, you know,
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  and of course these were, you know, what you'd call, you know, you better behaved weren't in the hoodlum culture,
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  but obviously I was around that.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  I mean, I've been, you know, in the middle of the inner city, you know,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  oh, I'm going to go into downtown or into far south Dallas with my friend who lives in Rockwall
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  and, you know, I'd go spend the weekend in the projects in south Dallas, folks.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  You know, they're at the basketball courts and they're by the crack houses.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  That was an interesting experience growing up and my parents let me do it.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  But I guess it did add to my understanding of things.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  But, you know, witness police being paid off and stuff, I've seen a lot of things.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  But it was the same even in those families.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  The black woman was the boss in the house and my friend's fathers, they had jobs,
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  but, you know, they gave the paycheck to her and they basically, it was almost encouraged that they be involved in alcoholism
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  and, you know, there'd be two or three brothers and sisters and a couple of them would be hoodlums even in the better families.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  And I remember being at my black friends' houses where there weren't, where they were on welfare
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  and I remember black women, black mothers who have an 18-year-old son, a 15-year-old son I was hanging out with and a daughter
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  saying, you've got to go Leroy, you've got to go, the social worker might come by and you know you can't stay here.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  I mean the black fathers are not allowed to stay with their children.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  So a black lady called in earlier and wanted me to tell this story again and so I've told it, I think gone further than I ever have
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  and that it tears my heart out to see them destroy the black community.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  It tears my heart out, my guts out to witness this type of thing.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  It hurts my feelings to know that from the time those coffin ships pulled up in Africa
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  with the transatlantic slave trade kicking off 500 years ago and running through the mid-1800s
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  and still today with the Arab slave traders, to know that on average half of the people died on the ship.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  They tended to not want too many older leadership type black males so they'd kind of give them an extra beating
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  to ensure that they would die on the way over and that they got off the ship and from that time on
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  they did everything they could to tear down their families, break down their culture and then they
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  quote, have a great society and welfare which was absolutely designed to break up.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  I mean there were black businesses, blacks were becoming wealthy, blacks, and I'm not debating immigration, blacks did not want to integrate.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  They had their own cleaners, their own restaurants, their own doctors, their own societies.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  The establishment did not like the fact that there were millions of black people marching in suits and ties
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  and that they were well spoken and that black illegitimacy was low.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  It was high compared to the white population but very low compared to what it is today, a fraction of it.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  And so they went in there with money and they went right back to the old slave system and they broke up those families
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  and you see what you've got today.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  Any time an African country tries to get up on its feet, any time an African nation tries to mine its own gold or diamonds or oil,
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  they get invaded, they get attacked, the globalists fund the country next door or fund some other group to invade.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  It just happened in Somalia again three weeks ago, two weeks ago, and this is the reality.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  So you ask ma'am and I've gone over and that's all verifiable, documented history.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  And there are smart, wonderful, great black women.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  I'm not here knocking black women but notice that the media, Hollywood, culture, it's never the strong black male,
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  it's always the strong fountain of wisdom black woman.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  And they want that stereotype, they want to, well they do it with, it's like Aaron Russo got told by Nick Rockefeller
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  but Gloria Steinem's admitted it now, one of her books, the CIA set up Ms. Magazine, ran the women's liberation movement
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  because women were already getting mad wanting to have equal rights which is a good thing,
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  but see they hijacked that movement and then used it to break up the family, turn women against men,
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  get both of the people in the household paying taxes and working so the children could stay at school till four
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  and now in many schools they're keeping them there till eight o'clock if quote the parents want them to
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  so the parents can go to the gym and go to the bar and then they go pick the kids up at eight o'clock if they've had a few beers.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  Now they're talking about getting rid of summer vacation, cutting it down to a month.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  Again, China's done the same thing where they have factories built on to the middle schools and high schools
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  and in some cases even with the fifth graders and you go to school four or five hours a day but just learning how to run the machines
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  and you go right over next door to the firework factory or the tennis shoe factory or the microwave factory or the cell phone factory.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  Same thing, this is how they've engineered our society, this is how they operate
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  and they now, again, 60% of, and I'm told the number is about to go up, of the college graduates are women,
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  60% of the doctors are now going to be women and it's going to be pretty much all women as news anchors,
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  it'll be women police chiefs and we will be their slaves.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  Look, the Bible's a history book and you look at Babylon and all these places, the Bible says when you become enslaved,
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  your new owners will set women above you and so women enjoy it.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  I mean, you're going to have a completely destroyed society, look what's happened to black people
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  and it's already happened, over 50% illegitimacy in whites and we'll be 90% making no mistakes soon enough
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  and the media will put out an image of a male, the cool thing is to walk with your shoulders bent over
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  and your pants hanging down, looking left and right and shifty and so your young males learn how to act like that.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  Well, that's just how the slaves acted 2,000 years ago and 200 years ago and we act just like slaves, don't we?
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  It's cool to make jokes and be stupid and not be able to talk because we're a social creature.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  They show us this on TV, every Fox TV show where it's a sitcom, the men are all complete scum idiots,
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  total drunk fools who can't do anything, the mother's the boss, see, see?
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  They play to be promiscuous, go ahead and get a divorce, you see?
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  Because they don't want men leading families, being strong tribal units, no.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  No, they want us to be a bunch of gang members acting like monkeys.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  Well, stop acting like it, you want to rebel, be straight and strong.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.

[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  Its multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.

[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  Welcome back. Let's go to some calls.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  We've got that big gas holdup against the IRS coming up in the next hour. Ed Brown, amazing story.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  Let's go to Patrick in Ohio. Thanks for holding on. I'm going to move quickly. Go ahead.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  Hey, Alex. It's Patrick here in Columbus. I called a couple months ago, but this time I want to talk about Big Brother in action.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  I was traveling from Florida back to Ohio, and on I-75 near Atlanta, Georgia, I happened to see Big Brother in action with a billboard
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  asking us to be profiled to prevent 9-11 from happening, and I just thought to myself...
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  And now they're using the AMBER Alert, which I told you 10 years ago as I read the federal plan,
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  is really going to be anti-gun messages, anti-terror messages, cattle on your neighbor messages,
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  and now they are right here in Texas and all over the country. Report terrorist 1-800.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  And, yeah, profile everyone. Help us spy on everyone. They're recruiting all the truck drivers. It's just hell on earth.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  I asked your listeners if they could possibly maybe take a picture of that to send.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  Well, why don't you go buy a disposable camera for eight bucks and take shots and mail it to me and I'll post it?
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  Well, you know, I'm in Ohio. This was in Georgia.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  Where were you in Georgia?
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  It was near Atlanta. It's about maybe 50 miles south of Atlanta on I-75.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  I-75, 40-50 miles south of Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  Yes, and that's where I saw it. And I'm going to get back to Ed Brown.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  I've been trying to gather information on him.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  You know, it's funny. Fox News portrays Ed as almost like a terrorist. He's like an enemy to the U.S.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  He's not paying his money into the private banks that are destroying the country. How dare him?
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  You know, they act like his house looks like it's a battle fortress with guns hanging out of it.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  It looks like a normal house to me when I look at the photos.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  Well, they're mad that he's saying, go ahead, come kill me. That's it. I've had enough.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  And wait till, God forbid, they kill a bunch of people like him. It's just going to be Waco after Waco.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  Every time they do it, our numbers swell. Every time they do it, we're that much closer to arresting these people.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  Just let them continue. Let them continue.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  You know, the Pentagon can lose $2.3 trillion.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  That's an AP article from five and a half years ago, sir. It's now 3.9 trillion.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  They can't go find that, but yet they're going to go attack this man who's minding his own business.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Well, the average idiot out there thinks, well, we've got to pay taxes. We've got to pay for stuff.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Your gas taxes, your road taxes, your property taxes, your state income taxes,
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  all of those things pay for the infrastructure which they're going to use to control us.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  As Ronald Reagan said, as the Commission said, as Paul K. Roberts will tell you,
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  not one cent of this money goes around the country, goes directly into the Federal Reserve.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  And then they're the ones that issue the money to begin with, order the Treasury, and control the money volume.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  It's a tool of control. The elites aren't even involved, quote, in money. They literally issue it.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  It's all about control. That's why when you make money, they don't send you credit cards every day,
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  but when you're poor and broke and living in a one-room, cockroach-infested apartment in college eating ramen noodle,
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  you get credit cards every few days in the mail. It's about getting you in the system. It's about debilitating you.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  It's about controlling you. It's about making sure you're not independent.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  It's about getting you into the system by hook or by crook.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  I agree with that. I'm just curious if somebody could actually find out how much George Bush actually makes off this war, off these oil companies.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  Well, George Bush is a mid-level puppet, and of course when you read Parade magazine every year, they tell you his wealth.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  It's a couple million. The Bushes are worth over $100 billion, conservatively, but that's just a mid-level family.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  The real families are worth trillions. Their real wealth has been estimated by the Russian publications and economists at over $300 trillion.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  That's conservative. So Bill Gates, people like that are nothing. Some guy worth $10 billion like Michael Dell is absolute nobody.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  It's all just fiat currency. Again, the whole economic system is a fraud. Everything we've been told is a fraud.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  The economic numbers are frauds. The Dow Jones is a fraud. I've walked through all this.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Just baseline 10 seconds, you can prove each one a fraud. Take the unemployment numbers.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  They don't count somebody who's been off the rolls for six months as unemployed.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  They just go out of the number crunch. Totally fake numbers.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 30 of the best winners, taking out all losers.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  Same thing with the NASDAQ, Standard & Poor's. It's the same scam, total fraud.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.000]  The comprehensive annual financial report is the real set of books for every government agency.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  County commissions, city councils, water districts, they're all running giant surpluses.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  Over 75% of total stock market ownership is by government. It's just all total fraud.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  Good to hear, friends. We'll be right back.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  Attention, attention, everyone. A brand new invention just released.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.000]  Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  And Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  That's Wristease, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, Wristease.com. Once again, Wristease.com.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:45.000]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  Shelly, you're like a...oh wait, why did you turn that down?
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice. I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice...
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  Well, what's the bed fan?
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  I could use something like that. This menopause thing is really getting to me at night and you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself. You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  I guess you're right.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  Why don't we try it? Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000]  I know where we can get some more information.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  The bed fan is the answer.

[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  That's bedfan.com.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  It's a corporate takeover. That's what these global corporations have done, infiltrating our government,
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  setting up their new world order, destroying our bill of rights and constitution.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  Dr. Paul Craig-Roberts was the number two at the Department of Treasury, the father of Reaganomics.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  He's becoming just a routine contributor here. We've interviewed him many times over the years.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  He was on last week with us while I was out of town with Bob Dacey.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  I'm honored to have him just pop in for 20 minutes or so today because of an incredible story he's written.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  The empire turns its guns on the citizenry and also to get his take on the latest developments with the build-up
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  and the carriers threatening Iran openly.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  But I promised to get to your call, so he's holding folks. He said this is okay.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  I want to hurry through a few of the callers that have been holding the longest.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  So quickly, Nathan and then Manuel and Greg and then I'll get to others later.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  Nathan, you're on the air from Texas. Go ahead.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  Hi, go ahead.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  I was just wondering if Mr. Russo had sought alternative cancer treatment.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  George Gordon or somebody said they have nine cures for cancer right now.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  Well, I'm not going to try to get into a debate about cancer.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  There are treatments, alternative treatments, but none of them are 100%.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  And yes, Aaron Russo has been fighting cancer and had a whole bunch of surgeries.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  He's having another one now, today or tomorrow.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  He's tried a bunch of alternative stuff.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  He's been fighting it for four years. They said he wouldn't last that long.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  He made America freedom to fascism while he was sick.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  And so anytime somebody, I don't agree with the statement that there are absolute cures.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  We're going to die.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  We're designed to break down and die to make room for the next group.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  And there's things you can do to put a long life.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  And he may live and he's been fighting it for four years.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  But that's basically it.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  Well, I was just curious.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  One of the reasons I've sounded like an idiot on air instead of an idiot.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  The idiot savant I am is I was under MD's care for insomnia.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  And after Ambien and Lemaster did work, they started giving me horse doses of an antidepressant.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  It had the wonderful side effects causing sleepiness.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  Are you still on it?
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  Nope. Nope.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  Got off of that. Wasn't doing me any good.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  It's causing more problems than helping.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  Well, good. Thank you for the call.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  We were going to get Aaron Russo on tomorrow, but he's in the hospital, folks.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  Real fast. Manuel in Pennsylvania. Go ahead.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  Hey, Alex. I called about the podcast.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  I've been having a little bit of problems with that.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  But since you got us down the track...
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  Okay, well, I can't really do.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  It's a free podcast, so there's not a lot of customer service involved with it.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  You can get the whole three hours of the show every day at the end of the show.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  It downloads, and there's different applications.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  If you have an iPod, there's one thing you click on.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  If you have an other MP3, there's another you click on.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  What, you're just unable to get it? Explain to me your problem.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  Yeah, my brother's the one that's on the computer, and he knows his way around that stuff.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  Sometimes he says it's missing, and we rely on it sometimes.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  I look at it today, I barely had time to call, and you know what I mean?
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  Okay, well, how often does the podcast work?
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  Ninety-five percent of the time, which is phenomenal, but you know how it goes.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  Sir, I've only got ten employees. I can barely pay them.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  We're totally fighting here.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  We're writing articles, making films, doing interviews.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  It's free, so I just really don't know what I can do for you.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  Even a criticism. We love what you're doing.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  We definitely appreciate it, but you know how that goes.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  Yeah, I've got to go to my guest. What else is going on?
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  Well, it was Jabari from College Hill.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  On TV, it's an instruction module. You talked about the Mammy.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  Now Mammy is television. If Kim from Texas, she was right when she said the Willie Lynch theory.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  My friend brings it up all the time around here.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  But Jabari from College Hill, the only well-spoken, disciplined one, sort of eclectic.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  It was a reality show. They followed the college kids, and they put them up, and they beat them down on that television show.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  That's all.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  Well, all images, basically, of men now on TV are of weak, bad people, and this is the system.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  I appreciate your call.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  I appreciate your call. I'm going to go to Dr. Roberts now, because I said I'd get to some calls, but I just can't have him sit there.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  Hey, Alex. How are you?
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  Oh, I'm pretty good. Just so much is happening.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  Let's get into Iran first. They've got a bunch of different task force groups there.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  Four different task force groups, two mainline carriers, another one going there.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  They're openly saying they may strike them. Israel's saying it.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  You've been talking about this now for over a year.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  What's on that front?
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  Well, yes, they intend to attack Iran.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  The so-called surge, it only has one purpose, Alex, and that's to prevent a withdrawal of our troops from Iraq before Bush can initiate war with Iran.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  Let me comment on that, and I want to see if you agree on what I've said.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  It's to give the Democrats shelter, because they're all a bunch of pro-war scum too, pro-New World Order, pro-empire.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  And so everybody in their constituency wanted them to force a pullout, so Bush puts in an extra 21,600 troops.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  Now the debate can be about the increase, instead of having a debate about the reduction, basically a bait to switch.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  Well, yes, you can say that. I think it's even worse. I think it's a red herring, a distraction.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Because it makes a non-issue the issue. The real issue is...
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  That's what I said, yeah.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  If the issue is to pull the troops out, and the pressure from Congress and the military and the public forces them to pull the troops out, then the whole adventure in the Middle East would be over.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  So he has to get a bigger war going fast.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  And so the whole purpose of the surge is to distract everybody while they put in place the means to attack Iran.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  And yes, Iran will be attacked. I have said that the only thing that could stop it would be if the leadership of both parties, of both houses of Congress,
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  went to the White House and told them he would be impeached before the week was out if he widened the war.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  But they won't do that because they really don't believe that Bush would have such audacity to initiate a wider war.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  Well, he had the audacity to have his Black Ops blow up those buildings on 9-11.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  They wouldn't. I said what they think.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  No, I agree, yeah.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  They think. And I wouldn't put anything past whoever is pulling his strings, whether it's him or Cheney or the Neocons or whoever it is.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  But I think that the Democrats are going to be surprised when they find that they're in a wider war, that they have to support in order to protect Israel.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  Well, I agree with you. And the entire House of Cards is going to collapse if they don't do this. People are on to them.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  So, really, it's a Ponzi scheme. They've just got to pump it up that much faster.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  Do you think, though, they're going to need a prelude to it, maybe a stage terror event or a provocateur event,
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  either in Israel or the U.S. or Europe that's so massive that then it can be blamed on Iran?
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  Well, they'll certainly use that if they need to. I think they're doing everything they can to provoke Iran.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  You know, they broke into that liaison office and arrested Iranian officials in Iraq.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  And we have these teams inside Iraq causing trouble. I mean, Iran.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  And I'm sure that they're capable of staging an incident or having a carrier attack and blaming the Iranians.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  There's anything they can do. They won't have any trouble starting a war.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  And let's be clear. This could lead to World War III. In fact, last week, the Korean Times reported on the big think tank speech given a week ago
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  in D.C. with a former high-level strategist and analyst at the State Department saying from 2005, saying,
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  oh, they plan to attack hundreds of targets, blow up their entire navy, attack their ground forces, attack their military bases,
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  attack even their military factories. I mean, the report is this is going to be a giant bombardment.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  Well, Alex, I don't know what they'll do. I think that what the neocons believe is that the only way they can prevail
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  against the Muslims and exercise American Israeli hegemony in the Middle East is now to intimidate them with nuclear weapons.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  That's right. They've openly said they may go ahead and nuke them. Just open nuclear attack.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  Yeah. So they've understood that they can't occupy them and they can't defeat them with conventional forces.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  So I think the notion is that they use tactical nukes. It will make the Muslims realize that they don't have any recourse
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  but to submit to the U.S. Israeli hegemony.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  But every major analyst, even people like Oliver North and others or even neocons are saying this is going to do the opposite.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  It's going to cause the whole Middle East to explode. Everybody's going to go absolutely ape, which is really what the neocons want,
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  to then widen the crisis so big we've got to go into the draft and total escalation.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  Well, I don't know what the effect would be. I suspect what the effect would be more anger among Muslims
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  and that we may see our puppets in Pakistan and Egypt, for example, overthrown.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  And of course Pakistan has nukes. Well, I guess then we'll have to go in there.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  I don't think there's any prospect of us going in with troops anymore in the Middle East.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  I understand. So the neocons would nuke Pakistan?
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  The neocons have written several times that what's the form of having nuke weapons if you can't use them.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  Oh, yeah, that's completely sane.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  Yeah. So I think that they are prepared to use them and what Karl Rove I think has figured out is that
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  they don't really need to go so gung ho in Iran. If they just strike and hit some things,
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  they can then announce that they've taken out Iran's nuclear weapons program.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  And that'll be a victory.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  And that this will be the victory that buries the defeat in Iraq.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  And all the Americans will say, oh, Bush saved us from Iranian nuclear weapons and his polls will go back up
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  and he can finish out in good order.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  Now that is another option. That may also be the one that's in play.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  So it might not be the big horrendous strike that we hear about.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  It might simply be an orchestrated victory.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  They'll strike something but not enough to produce the kinds of disasters that would lead to more war
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  and they'll declare victory.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  So do you think...
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  Do you think they'll go massive?
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  So do you think it'll be the pinprick or the go massive? You don't know.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  I don't know. I just don't know. They may not know themselves.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  They're trying to see what they can get away with, what the opinion is, what the well's doing, what Congress does.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  They are hesitating a bit, aren't they? Because the battle plan was from inside was to hit them around Christmas.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  Why do you think they're hesitating?
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  Well, I think they're hesitating because there's not any support for the current war.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  So to widen it is risky.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  And so they have to do it in a way that works for them.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  So interstate terror?
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  Yeah. If they're going to do it, they've got to do it in a way that works for them.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  And maybe they just haven't figured out all the details of that.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  But I do think they intend to hit Iran one way or the other.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  Well, they're already hitting them with sanctions.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  Yes, that's true. But I mean, militarily with weapons.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  I was just reading yesterday that they're having the carriers come in closer and closer to Iranian territorial waters, just begging for something to happen.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  They would love a new Pearl Harbor. They got a Pearl Harbor with 9-11. They'd love one in the Persian Gulf.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  I think the neocons would be very happy if both aircraft carriers sunk because that would rally the Americans again to an all-out war with Iran.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  And they do the same thing over and over again with Tonkin, Maine, Lusitania.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  I mean, they just love to blow up ships. I guess that's because it's hard to get caught doing that out in the middle of the ocean.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  Well, look, even if you get caught, you just deny it. And most people are going to believe the government.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  I mean, look, despite everything you've done about 9-11, still only 40 percent doubt the 9-11 Commission reports conclusions.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  So, you've got a majority of Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden or somebody attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  So, you can always look. The Israelis hit the USS Liberty in 1967. The Johnson administration buried it.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  You have to go on the website run by the Liberty crew to find out that it was the Israelis who attacked the plane, killed 34 American Navy men and wounded 130-something.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  And the United States government all pretends that it didn't happen or it was some kind of mistake.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  So, they can deny, whatever, just like they deny the Gulf of Tonkin. That's still not set. People still aren't even aware of that incident.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  That's right. The government, the CIA and NSA history department admit it was staged, but a lot of people still think it was real.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  Yeah. Yeah. So, they can get away with a lot. Like you said, they always have.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  Now, let's shift gears into the new story you've written. The empire turns its guns on the citizenry. Tell us about that.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  Okay. This really, Alex, is a review of a report put out by the Cato Institute about the rise of paramilitary police raids in America.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  It's about the militarization of your local police. It's an amazing thing.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  It turns out that there are now 17,000 local American police forces that are armed with rocket launchers, bazookas, heavy machine guns, all kinds of chemical sprays.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  In fact, some of them have tanks. You have now local police departments that are equipped beyond the standard of American heavy imagery.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  What do they use these for? For example, in recent years, there have been 40,000 or more call-outs of SWAT teams annually.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  So, that would be 110 times a day. Now, have you read about 110 hostage or terrorist events every day last year?
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  No.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  No. No. So, what are they doing? They're serving routine warrants to people who pose no danger to the police or to the public.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  Mainly they're used to serve warrants on drug users.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  Well, what happens is they break into homes and apartments in the middle of the night with people asleep.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  They use stun grenades. They cause all kinds of chaos and confusion.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  And the result is a tremendous number of innocent people are murdered in their beds, brutalized, traumatized, because in a very high percentage of these cases, the SWAT teams have wrong addresses. They've got the wrong people.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  Or they throw a flashbang into a baby's crib, or they shoot an old lady in the back, or they shoot one of their own officers and go nuts and kill everybody in the house.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  Right. Exactly. There you have it. It's a far greater source of terror for Americans than Muslim terrorists, because these things are happening 110 times every day.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  But that's the whole point of it. And now they're going to bring troops back. We've been running similar raids in Iraq thousands of times to expand the paramilitary force, and they admit the black mask, all of it, is about intimidation.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  This is going to be the paramilitary Nazi force that comes for our guns.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  That's part of the case. And you may know that part of the militarization of local police is that they give preference now to military veterans.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  And military veterans are, you know, the military is totally different from police. The police are supposed to be community related, and it's not supposed to have in its head the idea that you take out the suspect.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  Police are guardians, they're servants, they're defenders. The military kills people and breaks things and fights an enemy.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  So if you have every town with a militarized military police, they're there to fight an enemy. Who's the enemy? That's us.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  That's right. That's right. The suspect is the enemy, wherever he comes from.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  Meanwhile, the border is wide open. Dr. Roberts, stay there. Final segment. Let's continue with your analysis of this report. On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrors. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  Music
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  We're talking to Dr. Craig Roberts, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  Go through some of the other details you found in this big report that came out about the SWAT team, sir.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  Okay, it turns out that the source of information for most SWAT team raids are snitches.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  Snitches are criminals who make a living by being police informers.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  Many snitches are themselves drug dealers and they use their informant role in order to knock off the competition and in order to avoid arrest.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  So what you have is many of these people that find a SWAT team in the middle of their home in the middle of the night shooting up the place.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  They may be recreational drug users that a snitch sold a small amount of marijuana to that evening and went in front of the police.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  And a lot of police are on the take, too, from the mid-level drug dealers.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  They're only going to bust small people.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  They like snacks.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  They need to create the illusion.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  You know, they're all on Royds and they're snorting coke.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  The reason is that there's a federal program that gives money for drug enforcement to the state.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  And the feds, let me add this, the feds lobbied it 10 years ago and got it passed in almost every state.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  State laws where if the state gets the money, the police only get about 10 percent.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  But if the cops give it to the feds, they get about 70 percent back.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  Well, the way it works is the state doles out the federal money to the police forces based on the number of drug arrests.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  So then you get the police forces out hiring drug dealers to sell drugs to people and tell the police.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  And the drug dealers, of course, use this role to keep themselves from being arrested, but they turn in all their competitors.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  That's it.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  And it's the same reason with family violence that if the neighbor hears people arguing, the cops come, no one's hurt, nothing's broken,
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  they still arrest someone because just the arrest gets them a bounty for that, too.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  Right. That's exactly it.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  And that's the reason.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  So the SWAT teams were created, the first ones were in Los Angeles in the 60s.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  They got a big boost from Ed Meese's war on drugs during the Reagan administration.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  And they first called them special weapons attack teams, not special weapons and tactics.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  That's right. The assault teams, I think they called them.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  And the military started giving military equipment.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  And training.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  And training. And Congress passed a law in favor of that so that you now have these police forces so heavily armored that it's ridiculous.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  And they don't have any use for these SWAT teams.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  Well, we know it was all a cynical way to create paramilitary federally controlled, many of them have been deputized federally in the MJTF, multi-jurisdictional task forces.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  This is really just a paramilitary group of killers in every town to enforce.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  You're right. They can be used in that way.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  In the meantime, since there's no real use for them, there are not many hostage situations every day or terrorist situations.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  And they're expensive.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  They use them to serve warrants on people who are no threat.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  Well, Dr. Roberts, you've got an expert report on this, but let me add the caveat from Austin, Texas to New York City now.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  They put them out at checkpoints on the side of the road and now guys in mass come and search you there.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  I see.
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  Well, I would imagine it will get worse, Alex. I don't know what's to stop it.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000]  A lot of people believe in law and order and they think that police are on their side.
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  We've got a one minute break. I want to hold you for just three or four minutes on the other side.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  I want to ask you about Newt Gingrich, Hillary, all of them calling for free speech restrictions and the Lobbying Reform Act with Section 220 to imprison bloggers if they don't register as lobbyists.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  So stay there, Dr. Roberts. I've got one more question for you. This is powerful info.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:47.000]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:53.000]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:05.000]  This simple radioactive potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:21.000]  Call now and get free shipping. That's 888-803-4438.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  Even PBS has reported in the late 1960s, the Defense Department and the CIA approached Los Angeles about setting up special weapons attack teams.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  This was a federal program and plan to introduce it, popularize it. Then the federal government funded and helped with script writing for the show SWAT to then popularize it.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  And now special weapons and tactics is becoming the norm, with even normal beat cops carrying fully automatic weapons, the larger cities getting full bore tanks, rocket launchers, and it is to suppress the American people, as you saw in New Orleans coming in and confiscating guns.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  And Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, I was interrupting because on this subject I just started frothing. I've been studying it for so many years. As you know, I made three police state films, folks.
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  The Empire turns its guns on its citizenry. He brings out a lot of stuff that I didn't even bring up in my rants. Anything else on this, Dr. Roberts?
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  And I wanted to bring up the attack on free speech by Dean Rich now giving speeches every two days saying we should shut down the First Amendment.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  Let's get on to Gingrich. I think we've covered the fact.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  Sure. I mean, Dean Rich is saying attack free speech. They want to register all bloggers who get 500 visitors a year or more, prison time if you don't. They're attacking net neutrality. I mean, this is incredible. Do you think they'll be successful?
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  They may well be. I think once a police state starts, it's hard to stop it, and the only thing they don't control is the Internet. They control what's called the mainstream media.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  So I would imagine you will see these assaults. Probably the only, you know, the funny thing that will result from this is the only place you'll have any Internet that's critical of America will be in China or Russia.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  They won't be able to reach and shut down those sites, you see. At the same time, those sites won't be allowed to be critical of China or Russia, but they will probably be able to carry on about what's going on here. The thing is, the people here who experience it, see it, will have a hard time getting the word out.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  Well, that's it. Yeah, it goes back to regionalized news like we had a decade ago where nobody knows what's going on.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  Yeah, that's right. I think that they will go after the Internet. They'll go after it in many ways, and you're right that Gingrich, in fact, Hillary, any number of them, believe that it's necessary to suppress free speech in order to defend the nation from terrorists. So there you have it.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  How do you think Newt Gingrich has so much nerve to give speech after speech, even at free speech meetings, saying, look, we've got to restrict free speech? And then before the Congress, Albert Gonzalez a few weeks ago came out and said there is no habeas corpus in the Constitution. He said there's no guarantee of that.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  Yeah, well,
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  It says it twice.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  Well, of course it does. But you're saying, why are they saying all this? Because they realize they have control and they can get away with it. They got away with 9-11. They have started a war. It's a war criminal government. They're getting away with everything.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  So I think they can say whatever they want. The Federalist Society, which is a collection of Republican lawyers, supposedly people who believe in original intent, but what it really believes in is power in the executive.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  And that's the basis for all the judicial appointments that the Republican Party makes. And so who's going to criticize them? I mean, other than the people on the Internet, like you and me, there's no way to criticize them.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  So I think getting away with 9-11, it was the Reichstag fire. And this whole thing may go on until they have a Stalingrad.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  Well, I think they're going to have a Stalingrad. They're going to have a Waterloo because people everywhere are becoming enraged. And, I mean, I've got big mainline talk stations calling up, picking up the show.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  You know, they're owned by medium-sized companies where their CEOs are angry. I think the worm's turning. I think we've got a chance, though, Dr. Roberts.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  Well, that's why we keep speaking out, isn't it, Alex? So good luck to you in everything you do.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  God bless your courage, and thank you for spending so much time with us, Dr. Roberts. Your columns are all over the Web. People can find them there. Take care.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  We'll be right back with Mr. Brown.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  Dad, can we stop? We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  What? Again? We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark-Burkey water bottles.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  Why did you do that?
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time. And that way we don't have to listen to them singing,
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  for the entire trip.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000]  Hmm. I didn't think about that. Great idea.
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids. Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.000]  And using our Spark-Burkey bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000]  Honey, you're terrific.
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  Oh, honey, so are you. You're the one that bought the family our Spark-Burkey water bottles.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000]  Now can we stop? I need to go, too.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  Get your Spark-Burkey support purification bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at www.burkeywater.com.
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, Miami film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:57.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British Intelligence.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news,
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state, notifying our first amendment.
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:54.000]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:59.000]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act, which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  Many people believe that this will be the Mark of the Beast because of the restrictive measures included,
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.000]  which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says,
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000]  If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  It says, worship the beast.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD,
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000]  call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  Remember in the last few months I was going to have Aaron Russo on three times
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  and he just kept saying, oh, he had to cancel?
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  He was having emergency surgeries and he's going to be having another surgery.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  He needs our prayers, folks.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  He said I can tell people a little bit, but I don't want to get into too much details.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  It's rough, folks.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  The guy gave us an hour and a half, was ready to keep going,
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  but he was so tired when I saw him a few weeks ago in Houston that I just cut the interview off then.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  He is fighting for his life, folks.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  He's been battling cancer for four years.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  He almost died.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  He was very, very sick when he made America freedom to fascism.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  Having surgeries, undergoing all this treatment, he's tried alternative.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  He's tried surgery.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  I don't know how many times they've cut stuff out of him.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  He tried chemo just a few months ago.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  He's such a fighter.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  That's really what got him down, obviously.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  The reason I bring this up is we need to pray for Aaron Russo.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  He's got a big heart.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  He's a good man.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  It's hard to make a film and travel all over the country and do 30-plus interviews,
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  and make a film and get it in theaters and do everything he did.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  This really is his great work.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  He says this is what he is most proud of in his life.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  When my office talked to Ed Brown today,
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  who's ready to go toe-to-toe with the criminal government, the SWAT teams,
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  up in New Hampshire, over the fact that they claim he owes taxes, there's no law,
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  to the private Federal Reserve and the people that are destroying America.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  Talking to him, he told me that most of the support,
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  a lot of the support he's getting is because of freedom to fascism.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  It's college students, it's high school students, it's young people.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  Hundreds that have come out to his home to support him.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  Thousands of phone calls and emails, and this isn't really getting any,
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  it's starting to get some national attention as they demonize him.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  Here's a local Fox piece attacking him, and we'll go to Mr. Brown,
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  but I wanted to have Mr. Russo on with him today, but he can't do it.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  Having to have a surgery every few weeks is tough,
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  and Aaron is a trooper.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  And we're going to be in the next few days putting a video up for prisonplanet.tv members,
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  an hour and a half long interview I did with Aaron Russo.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  Amazing interview where he went further than he's ever gone about the Rockefellers trying to recruit him,
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  and just shut up and everything else.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  I mean, that's how real this is. These demons will actually come to you.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  I've had high-level globalist minions come to me, and I mean, this is real, folks.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  I mean, with all the evidence we've got, when you actually get approached by them,
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  that really takes it home to you, let me tell you. It really takes it home to you.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  This is what we're fighting, this is what we're facing,
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  and let's go to the clip of Ed Brown, for those that missed it when we played it on Monday,
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  and then we're going to go to this hero. Here it is.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  A New Hampshire man holed up in this house in anticipation of a tax standoff.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  He and his wife have refused to pay any income tax for more than a decade.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  They claim that supporters from across the country are on their way to New Hampshire.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  The standoff is happening in the town of Plainfield, New Hampshire.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  That's where we find Fox 25's Sharman Suketty tonight.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  Sharman, what's the latest?
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  Well, just a few hours ago, Ed and Elaine Brown were convicted of owing three-quarters of a million dollars
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  in back federal taxes for not paying their taxes for about ten years.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  Now, Ed Brown is refusing to leave his home here in Plainfield, and he is preparing for an armed standoff.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  They're just trying to steal the money. I don't owe them anything. I don't care what they say.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  Moments after he and his wife were found guilty on federal tax evasion charges, Ed Brown is defiant.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  He's holed up inside his concrete home here in Plainfield, New Hampshire,
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  waiting for what he calls a fascist American government to make its next move, and he says he has weapons.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  I expect a war this time to magnitude like this world has never seen before.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  Whether I survive this initial armed standoff or not makes no difference.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  Prosecutors say Brown and his wife Elaine, a dentist, owe $750,000 in back federal and payroll taxes.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  But Brown, who refused to appear in court for the verdict, says the laws do not apply to him or his wife.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  Right in court room, I said, show me the law where I have to pay the tax, and I'll write you a check right now.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  The driveway leading to Brown's home is blocked off by trucks.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  At the other end, supporters have hung flags and signs.
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  Some of them read, don't tread on me.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  A self-described millionaire, Brown says he can live inside this home for as long as it takes.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  He has battery power and water, and now he's waiting for what he believes are many more who feel the same,
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  ready to confront authorities.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  I don't think you understand just how many are coming and what's going to happen here.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  Now the judge in this case has banned Elaine Brown from staying here at her home in Plainfield.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  She's actually staying at a home in Worcester with a relative.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  We understand the U.S. Marshals, they tell us they have no plans to come to the house.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  They have established an open line of communication, however, with Ed Brown.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  Sentencing in this case set for April, they could get three to five years.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  We're live here in Plainfield, New Hampshire.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  Now remember the first thing Ashcroft Tiffany got in.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  They raided the second largest church in America, the Indianapolis Baptist Temple,
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  because the pastor found out that he wasn't supposed to be 501c3, the churches didn't need that,
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  they never had it before, the 50s, and so of course he just refused to go under IRS control
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  and to be under their political control.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting a free exercise thereof.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  And Dumbo bureaucrats listening, you can't even tell me the law that says you can control the churches.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  You can't, you're criminals.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  But they'll just say I got a machine gun and I'll send guys in black uniforms who are completely stupid
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  to enforce something that doesn't exist.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  This is tyranny!
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  And they waited until the crowds left, they waited until the support left, and then they did raid it.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  And they kept promising, oh we're not going to raid it, oh we're not going to raid it, and then boom they did.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  Let's go now to Ed Brown in New Hampshire.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  Ed, thank you for coming on the show, sir.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  I hope Lexington or Concord doesn't start at your home with the new Waco, but are you saying in May?
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  In May? Is that what you said?
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  I mean, I'm asking you.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  I have no idea.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  It sounds like the same scenario that happened elsewhere with the Baptist Church.
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  You know, they're going to wait until everybody goes away, they think, this time, and then they're going to make their move.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  But frankly, I don't mind.
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:10.000]  Actually, I didn't hear that Fox report before, that's the first time I heard it.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  That's not untrue what I said.
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  So I thought it really demonized the thing worse than what it was.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  Well no, that's a local piece, there's a national piece that does demonize you.
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  That's what I didn't like, the national piece, yeah.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.000]  But at any rate, I'm not concerned.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.000]  So let them come.
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  It's against the law, I'm not going to let anyone violate my rights, my guarantees under the Creator.
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  Period.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  Well, I go back to this, and I commend your courage.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  They said there's a law that blacks aren't humans, but they couldn't really show the law, they just enforced it.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  And finally, black people just said, no, I'm going to run away to try to stop me, I'm going to kill you.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  And just like they say, and they said, no, it's the law, blacks aren't humans.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000]  And you're saying this isn't a law, it's a fraud, it's a scam, it's a private cartel.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  I mean, break down how you got to this point, tell us about Ed Brown, tell us how you got to this point,
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  and then what transpired, and why you're drawing your line at the sand,
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  and hopefully what doesn't turn into your Alamo.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  Very quickly, I grew up with the attitude and philosophy as a red, white, and blue grammar and apple pie.
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  Born in 1942, saw the World War II, and saw the victories, and came through the 50s nice and at peace,
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  and calm, and relaxed, and was quiet, and in the 60s came in and began very tumultuous.
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  At any rate, it goes further on, I had no parents of my own, so I kind of adopted the John Wayne philosophy as my father.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  If I had to have a father, I would have been John Wayne.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.000]  So, you know, you never hurt people, you certainly never hurt or abused women.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  So I developed this feeling and attitude toward, you know, taking care of the weaker, or the infirm, or whatever.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  That's my philosophy.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  And so, as we got older and older, and things changed for me up and down, and God, even by the time I hit 40 here,
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  I was homeless for five years, because my second and most made sure my family had the house roof over their heads.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  I gave up the house, gave up the business with my wife, so the children would still have a home,
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  and I could go back and visit and stuff at the gym, you know, that sort of thing.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  So then, a long story short, through all that stuff, I met my wife, my current wife.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  We've been together now for 22, 23 years.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  And it's been one just beautiful relationship from day one to the present time, until May 24, 2006.
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  And all we do is grow.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  I have no way until I break the law.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  I have given myself the gift of honor.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  And what happened? Tell us what happened.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  Tell us how the IRS first appeared.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  So after our investigation over the past 12 years, we thought they'd be here 10 years ago,
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  and they came in 10 years later, two years ago, in November of 2004.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  And they came, they arrived with 28 approximate personnel.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  20 of them were CID, IRS, two U.S. Marshals, and one Postal Officer.
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  And they had up on the hill a sniper with three observers, two state troopers backing them up behind them,
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  and one state trooper across the street, across by the shopping mall.
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  Everybody was armed.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  Everybody had body armor.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  And that was just to download a computer.
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  My God, that must have been one nasty computer.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  After that, I decided this is what we wanted.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  We were waiting for them to do this, because we knew, though, we already knew that there was no law of attacks.
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  But we couldn't just win there and sue them.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  It wouldn't work.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  It wouldn't work. You know, of course, we just dismissed it.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  Now I had a state case, a tort case, of damages.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  They hurt my wife's business, they embarrassed me.
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  A credit card would be a character assassination, all kinds of things.
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:05.000]  So then we sued them, and well, five or six months later, in a state court after we got the court case together.
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.000]  Stay there, Ed Brown, under siege in New Hampshire.
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000]  We're going to break, sir. We'll come right back to you, okay?
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  Fantastic.
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000]  Rick Blake will be back with Ed Brown.

[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine. Did you know that the United Nations Charter outlines a path to world tyranny?
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?

[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt. But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking a 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:23:00.000]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System. In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce. However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:41.000]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products. I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air. I was so amazed. I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight. Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:57.000]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:05.000]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil simple natural cleaning products, also made with Himalayan salt. I figured it would clean really well.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent. This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with. Plus, the service was great.

[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  Welcome back. Ed Brown, got a lot of courage. He's chosen his battle after they SWAT teamed him and did all this stuff. He said, well, I'm going to sue him. We've gotten up to that point. Please continue, sir.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  I forgot where I was. You got to the point of where now you had a tort against them. You've been waiting for this for 10 years.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  I had a state tort against them now and filed charges against four officials that were in charge of that operation.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  U.S. Attorney Colin Tawano, his assistant, William E. Morris, John Hickey of the Postal Service, and the IRS officer in charge who ordered all of this mess, James John out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  These are the officers in the New Hampshire office. When I filed it, he paid my dues to the state court under Jean Burling in Grafton County Superior Court.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  She immediately the same day turned the thing over to the United States District Court. They then in turn over the next week notified me that the court has now been transferred to the federal court.
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  I notified them that there was no federal jurisdiction involved in this case.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  Let me be clear. Let's be clear. The IRS has its own little special courts. And any time you try to sue them for violating your rights, you're supposed to be able to go through the process of the courts.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  And then if it gets appealed, it moves up. But no, they just outside the law, outside the procedure, just pass it on.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  Absolutely. That's exactly what they did.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000]  Again, lawlessness. The government is lawless. Go ahead.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  But in collusion with a state judge, Jean Burling, sanctioned by the governor. Uh oh, we got a serious problem here.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  Guess what? They got no more courts in this country. So now, the United States District Court asked me to come in. I told them I can't come in because there's no federal jurisdiction here.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  And I explained it to them. They even sent them the information from a national attorney. They turned around and dismissed the case.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  Six months later, they turn around, six o'clock in the morning, in collusion with the local police department.
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  I have you come down to the water point. You go to the rest of the ground, we're here with two police officers here, the water department, to help you out.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  I knew what it was. I went down there and walked right up to them and said, yeah, yeah, yeah. And bam, one hits me and then two of them are piled on top of me and scream like the top of their lungs.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  Stand up, stand up. First they lie, they've already rated you once, you didn't do anything to them, now they physically assault you because they're criminals. Okay, continue.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  It gets really interesting now. So a half an hour later, they picked up my wife, put her in handcuffs and drove her directly to Concord.
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  But prior to that, they picked me up, they got me in handcuffs, off the ground shackles and handcuffs.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  And then they brought me to the local police department, the Lebanon police department cruiser, brought me into the police department and ready, stripped me and he took all my clothes off.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  And he faced the wall, bent over, spread the cheeks of my buttocks.
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  I understand, it's all about rape and humiliation, please don't go any further.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  That doesn't work, okay, because I don't care.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  Exactly, it makes you hate them.
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  It gives you power when they do that evil.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  They think it intimidates us, it only makes us commit more to fight them.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  They're showing everybody what they are, a bunch of mafia thugs.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  So these pieces of trash are in there, they're all over your body, they're doing all this to you, please enjoy that.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  So that's all to put fear into you, it didn't put fear into me, it put anger, you're right.
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  What were you saying to them while they were doing this, these perverts?
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  Not a thing, not a single solitary thing.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  All I was doing was just baiting, this was my case, we started this case twelve years ago.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  We were waiting for them to start doing stuff like this so we could file civil damages, all kinds of damages.
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  Okay, please continue.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  Alright, so then they brought me down to the district court, the United States District Court, put me in a cooling cell there for about eight hours, I sat there twilling my thumbs.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  Then they brought me before the judge.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  Then, that's the point, when I sat down at the bench and the judge came in and seated himself, they served me with the papers.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  First time I've seen any papers, I've asked the US Marshals whether I was being charged with the arrest warrant.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  We'll discuss that when we get down to the court.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  We're just told to bring you in.
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  That was all unlawful.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  So no chance to get a lawyer, no chance to get counsel, no nothing, no arrest warrant, nothing?
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  Correct.
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  They supported that very easily, but they wouldn't allow that, no time.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:56.000]  The first thing that the judge did was say, Mr. Brown, he says, how about this, this is just for the arraignment, how do you plead?
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000]  I said, I don't know, what are you talking about?
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  Because I still didn't know what they were talking about.
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:06.000]  He turns around and says, the attorney, the court appointed an attorney that was there, which I didn't say get him or accept him.
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.000]  That was all staged, we don't have courts, it's the Soviet Union, America's completely, stay there, stay there, so we've got to be right.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000]  I mean, I want you to listen to this, this is how it operates, this is the new America.
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:21.000]  Okay, totally enslaved like Russia or Nazi Germany, and it's only going to get worse.
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:30.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  Pinch me, Bill, I can't believe it.
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:44.000]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car, and here we are with season tickets on the 50 yard line.
[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:50.000]  I know what you mean, John, I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.000]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:01.000]  I was struggling to make ends meet, now I've got a new car, and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.

[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  People who use Cartivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  For over five years, Cartivite has proven itself time tested.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:44.000]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartivite.
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:53.000]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and the metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:58.000]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form, it's like Cartivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill,
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:01.000]  now going for a regular job a few months later.
[02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000]  We know we're doing something right.
[02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.000]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.000]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.000]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:26.000]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:32.000]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  We will die for the system.
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  We're going to go back to Ed Brown here in a moment.
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  Literally, their last stand could develop in New Hampshire.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  I'd like to hear from callers who specifically want to talk about this issue.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  I know we've got a bunch of holding we'll get to you, but I want to hear from callers who want to talk about Ed's courage, what he's facing, how you can help him.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  You know, some of my staff are like, pledge to help him, pledge to go up there to New Hampshire, be part of it.
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000]  The feds are going to wait.
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000]  I don't pledge somebody my support unless I can give it to them.
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  I don't say I'm going to stand right there with you and I'm going to be there with you and I'll guarantee you're going to be safe, Ed.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  No, I'm here trying to support him on the air.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000]  I'm trying to give him support.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  We know when they're coming or they start driving up with tanks and getting ready for an assault, I'll try to jump on an airplane.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  You know, I was young when Waco happened, but I pledged after that to not stand by and watch this stuff anymore if we ever had a chance.
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  But the feds are smart.
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:20.000]  They're not going to let their armor build up and then let people like Lexington and Concord show up.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:26.000]  They'll hit Ed three, four, five months from now at 3 a.m. in the morning.
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  So I hope he's got alarm systems all around there and we need people who will get together and agree.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  I'll go for a week, I'll go for a week, I'll go for a week and just keep it there with witnesses for as long as possible because they also won't want video cameras.
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  We need to get a web camera hooked in there that's wireless without the feds knowing that can then send it to a remote server.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  I, of course, have those in my office and a lot of other security I won't mention.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  And home, of course.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:06.000]  But that's what we need because the few times we've, like, BATF, remember in Tucson?
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  A couple of years ago, they come in the gun shop they've been wanting to shut down.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  The guy hadn't, they passed a new law he hadn't heard about, he had to have a permit as a pawn shop.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  Even though it was a gun shop, they put it in there.
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  And then SWAT team knew they were, and the BHF's going, man, this is a $5,000 gun.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:26.000]  I'm going to keep that one. All right, don't file it.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  Listen, how are we going to plant something illegal on him?
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.000]  And they're just throwing all these guns in trash cans.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  Hey crooks, there was a VCR on 24 hour record mounted and you got caught on video trash.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  And we're mounting cameras everywhere and we're showing more.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  Like that cop when they pulled over, a fellow that has worked with Mike Hansen, Robert.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:54.000]  And he had that hidden camera in that car and the cop started shooting his mouth off about how he liked to kill Robert.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  And we put that on the web and now that guy's in danger of getting fired.
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  So you just keep your business up.
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  Because there's some of us who aren't afraid of you anymore and afraid of your criminal masters.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  And you are so stupid most of you don't even know your criminals.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  You think we're here to be treated like trash and be abused by you while your bosses ship in the drugs.
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  And while you ruin our society.
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000]  We're not putting up with it anymore.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  All right, I'm going to shut up. I'm getting really mad here.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:24.000]  I'm about to go back to Ed and your calls.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  Please go to infoawars.com and order America Freedom to Fascism.
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  Get the DVD. Make copies. Get it out to people.
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  Get aggressive so they know this is a fraud.
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000]  The people are really waking up right now. Strike while the iron's hot.
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  If you get it for $19.95, you can get Terror Storm for $9.95 as a special.
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000]  And if you already have one of the films, go get the special and give the other video to somebody.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  Infoawars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  We have an incredible activist tool on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  All 15 of my films, my weekly TV reports, special video reports.
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  We've been doing like 3 or 4 a week lately.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  Up there on the website.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  It's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  It's an insane deal.
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  Prisonplanet.tv and your support and membership.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  I want to thank all the members, by the way.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  Makes what we do here possible.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  Let's continue and kind of condense it down if we can, Ed.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  We'll do a part 2 if we need to here as this develops.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  Condense down then this saga.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:26.000]  You're now in the courtroom.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  Then I want to go through how America Freedom to Fascism, you said,
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  is what's getting you most of the support that people really have woken up.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  And it's exponential.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  It's going to double in the next year what it's already doubled.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  And so forth and so on.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  But let's go back here to the courtroom.
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  You're in there.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.000]  The judge won't even say what you're charged with.
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  He just says, how do you plead?
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  Please continue.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  He said, how do you plead?
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  I said, I don't know.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  Then, of course, he's a court-appointed attorney.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  Immediately he jumped up and said, how do you want it?
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  He pleads not guilty.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  I said, excuse me?
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  And then, well, he pleads not guilty.
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  Real fast, I go, well, the next thing Mr. Brown is, sir,
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  I'm totally confused with this mess.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  At any rate, we move along to Mr. Brown.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  We cannot release you unless we have the firearms out of your house.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:21.000]  We understand that you have, like, dirty guns in your house.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  So you notice they're now charging you with, I guess, tax evasion.
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  They won't even say what it is.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:30.000]  Now he wants you to incriminate yourself in front of court to say you have guns.
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  He would then try to claim that in talking about your guns
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  would be some type of threat to him.
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  They do that all the time.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  Then they imprison you for a threat on a judge.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  So this is incredible.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  Please continue.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:46.000]  Well, he said, I'm concerned about my officers' safety.
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  So I need to have...
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  See, he wanted you to verbally talk about guns and officers
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  and their safety to misconstrue it.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  And, by the way, we've never talked.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  I didn't know this part of the story.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  This is the first for most listeners.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  They're seeing, I guess, of course, what it would be.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  This is how these criminals set people up.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  So I knew Donald Roth.
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  I mean, in his cell, I couldn't do any work there.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  I didn't care what the attorney said.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  You know, I'm there in my own capacity as I sit as a man.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  Yeah, he just says, we're not telling you what we're charging you with.
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  Plead guilty. Tell us about your guns.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  Here's your lawyer.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  That's correct.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  What lawyer? I can't use a lawyer on a 20.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  I have no choice. I'm not there to have someone to re-present me.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  I'm already there. I am present.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  So why would I need a attorney?
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  So what happened next?
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  I signed a paper to allow them, because I didn't care about the guns.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  So I knew where the guns were going.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  He said, we're going to go to Riley's Sports Shop, blah, blah, blah.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  We have some friendly terms with us.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  And really, they just didn't have a search warrant for the house.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  Let me guess, they stole a whole bunch of stuff when they were in there other than guns.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  Well, yes, they did.
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  Oh, see, okay. This is okay.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  Yeah, that's interesting you said that.
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  No, well, sir, they have a handbook.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  Okay, this is a mock-up.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  Yeah, I know. You got it all day, huh?
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  So they took about $15,000 worth of guns.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  If you've got gold, they always steal that.
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  And the cops all divvied up outside.
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  Well, they couldn't get the gold, because I had that hidden somewhere.
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  Oh, ma'am, yeah.
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  Oh, don't let them know that. They'll be out there with shovels.
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  It's already gone. It's already gone.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  At any rate, so I went home, by the way.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  So our agreement was, listen very carefully now.
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  Our agreement was that my wife, who didn't drive, she was already on her way home,
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  would drive home and show them where all the guns were.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  I says, okay.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  And I said, go ahead, tell them where all the guns were.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  Little did you know there was already a SWAT team waiting, I'm guessing here,
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  and the minute you acquiesced, all color of law, they were in your house.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  What, were you there?
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  No, I studied the New World Order, sir.
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  Yeah, me too.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  They were there at 11 o'clock, even before I went into the courtroom.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  At 11 o'clock tomorrow, I went to the courtroom 3.30 in the afternoon.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  They'd already photographed every square rule.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  Oh, so it was worse than I said.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  The judge had probably told them, hell, you already went in there without a search warrant?
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  You can get in trouble.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  We've got to now trick him into acquiescing.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  Well, I acquiesced only to them getting the guns.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  Not to go in any place else at all, but they went in every single drawer.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  I know what they did.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  So continue with the crimes, just kind of sum it up for us.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  I know there's thousands of them, but you know.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  Yeah, I know.
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  So they let me go after that.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  They got all the guns.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  I went back home.
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  But they left me standing out, cooling my heels while I had to wait three hours for a ride to get home.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  I had no phone or nothing.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  So then I went home and waited for court, come court time.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  Six months later, I filed 42 motions.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000]  Denied, denied, denied all 42 of them.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  Got into the courtroom.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  The judge's jury rigged it.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  Yeah.
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  What do you call it?
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  Jerry Tampering.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:56.000]  Jerry Tampering, rigged the jury.
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  Jerry Tampering.
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:02.000]  Then I had every single motion that I had in the court.
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  And then would never even let you talk.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  And before you could even, as the first word left your mouth, he would say, you know, he would tell you to shut up.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  You were never even allowed to talk or defend yourself.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  He was a little more polite than that, but that's basically it.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  Okay.
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  So then we went further.
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  He had a special meeting with us at one afternoon for the prosecutor, second day of trial.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  And he said, I was vying for this trial, by the way, because now I got a chance to really nail these puppies once and for all.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  And to get my evidence out there.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  But it wasn't working out that way.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  So anyway, he had us come in after the court, the jury left the room and everybody else left the room.
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  So it was just the judge and my wife and myself talking about what's going to happen and what we needed to do.
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  So he tells us that we cannot show our evidence.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  We cannot, because if any of the evidence was what he didn't consider, you know, good enough, you know, and he said all of our evidence wasn't good enough.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000]  He finally allowed one video, that's all.
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000]  He disallowed all witnesses except for one.
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  Ten of my witnesses, which were witnesses for the prosecution, which were the US officers, he wouldn't have let me witness that.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  I have a single one of them.
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  Yeah, I can't even call the cops that did this to you.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:22.000]  Thank you.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:24.000]  He wouldn't even allow it. I couldn't believe it.
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  It's not relevant. It doesn't pertain to the case that you're suing them, the people you're suing and you're not allowed to call.
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  Exactly. That's exactly what he did.
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  I could not believe you know that much of it. Good Lord.
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:36.000]  It's always the same shirt. It's not very hard.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000]  I know.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  I could finish your story if you like. I've never heard it.
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  Yeah, I know, I know.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  But now we're down to, okay, our time to go into court. We left court on Thursday in the afternoon and we knew right then and there as soon as we saw the jury tampering on his decision to advise the jury how he was going to make his decision to them, what they had to do.
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  We said, I said, I'm not going back.
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000]  There's no way in the world I'm going back to this judge and this court.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  That's a sham.
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:06.000]  Well, it's not a real court.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  No, it's not.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.000]  You already had them just ignore the whole process of the courts and pass it up to the feds the first time.
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:13.000]  Totally gone.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  Okay, so then what did they later find you guilty of?
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:22.000]  Oh God, something called structuring and whatever that was and willful failure to file, the usual stuff.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  And then they compounded it so it accumulated to 17 counts.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  Now the news pieces act like they've just been sweet to you and they're not going to hurt you and they've never touched you.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:42.000]  They have it broken in your house and had snipers aimed at you and you're just crazy saying that armed force is coming and I guess when they SWAT team you then everybody will forget about what they promised beforehand.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  So when did you decide to just come on, you want a war, you know, I mean, frankly, you're saying you're ready to die. What got you to that point?
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  My wife, she was absolutely in terror.
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000]  I mean, she's like half destroyed now.
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000]  The damage is a permanent for the rest of her life.
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:02.000]  I'd rather live on your feet than on your knees and you've just had enough of a terrorist.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:06.000]  Absolutely. I mean, I could choose at least the way I go.
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  And I'm not going to go as a coward. I'm not going to go as, I'm just not going to go that way.
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  I'm not going to be enslaved for one second by any man.
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  I am a man of the Creator, period. End of that story.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  So my wife, I have a responsibility to my wife, my country.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  Now she's not in the house and the media is saying that they're keeping her out of the house. What's going on with that?
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  She's in prison. She's a prisoner.
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  Yeah.
[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:36.000]  She's a prisoner in her son's house with one of those little lake things on, you know, little flashing lights on them.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.000]  When did they get her?
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  She turned herself in. I was in sheer terror. I wanted not to do it, but I couldn't stop her. She has her own decision to make.
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  Well, it's not women's job to fight, so that's okay. She's out of the way.
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  She's out of the way, so she's safe down there where she is, but she's still a prisoner. She can't leave, we can't see each other.
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:47:01.000]  Now, you better get a couple of those disposable track phones from Slave Mart or wherever, because, you know, they're going to turn your cell phone and all your lights and power off.
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:03.000]  No, they can't do that.
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:09.000]  Right before they attack you. Now, I understand, but they may even try to jam your existing signal, so I'm sure you're all backed up and ready.
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:14.000]  When the descendants are coming up, when do you think these bastards will try to hit you?
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  I don't know. I'm prepared every day, 24 hours a day.
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.000]  What have people said they're going to do if they come in against you? You said you're getting a lot of help.
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  Yes. It's not so much the help that was while I'm here. They're going to have to worry about what's going to come after.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  And by that, you mean a lot of people are saying this is it?
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  We said this stuff a long time ago. Remember, as I said to you, Alex, this is my case.
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  We knew what we were getting into when we got into it in the beginning.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  We knew, like you, you know how they operate, so do we.
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  So we knew full well if they want to go full bore, you know, to the wall, then we have no other choice.
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  Somebody had to stand up to this country and make the move from the middle class. Somebody that had some substance.
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  So you're ready to go down like Travis for a Remember the Alamo cry?
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  That's what we call this place, the Little Alamo.
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  Well, you see, this is what the enemy can understand. They're so afraid to lose their lives.
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  They're so afraid of even people looking down on them, not having their little trinkets and segments of power.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  And they don't understand that that's the whole point here. We're putting ourselves in their way.
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  We're going to make them act like tyrants. We're going to show everybody who they are.
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  And we're winning more and more ground every day, and they're starting to figure that out.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  And they may do like what they've done to other people that have stood up like you. They may just leave you alone.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  Well, they can do whatever they want to do, but I'm not going to leave them alone.
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  I've got some huge lawsuits here. And as a matter of fact...
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  But, Sir Ed, they don't...
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  They don't care.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:57.000]  The courts are frauds, you know.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  Why not? But that doesn't make any difference. That's why I can't tell you in law, through proper litigation, how we're going to approach it.
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  But just watch what we do through proper litigation. Lawful, proper litigation.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  Well, it's the court of public opinion. Waco woke this country up, and the feds carried out on the same date to try to mask that memory that it was causing a revolution.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  And if they kill you and they kill a bunch of other people, which they're going to do to some, it's only going to backfire on them.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  Yeah, big time. Waco is what woke me up, Alex.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  Yeah, woke me up too.
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  Yeah, I really did. So, enough is enough. You know, you're right. I'm mad at selling. I'm not going to take it anymore. You're right.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  So, this is where we stand right now. We're here every day. I just bought the driveway. We had a bunch of folks over over the weekend.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  We had a nice wedding party with a bunch of little babies and kids and stuff. It was a good time. It's nice weather today.
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  So, they're cleaning off the ice right now. Maybe have a little ice skating party, you know, tomorrow or the next day.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  There's a lot of people at your place right now.
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  There's a lot. But, you know, we're getting ready for the weekend group, you know.
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  The weekend group, there's more people come over. The families come over and stuff with their kids.
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:16.000]  So, there's folks standing there with their children at the Little Alamo with you?
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  Not at the moment. Just some others are standing here with me. But, yeah, they come over.
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  Oh, yeah, one couple I was amazed. I was almost in tears. He brought in a one-year-old, a three-year-old and a five-year-old with his wife and on himself.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  They stayed the whole weekend here cooking and, you know, doing other things for everybody. It was really great people.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  Lots of them. Lots and lots of them. They never humbled me, Alex.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  We'll be ready for a man and a couple men and women, but you'll be able to tell them the evil in their eyes, the fear in their eyes.
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  Get ready for them to try to infiltrate with undercover cops on you.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  We already threw one of them out of here the other night in the night before last and he's already caused us all kinds of us.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:03.000]  He's one of those guys by the name of David Ridley, it looked like. And he works for Fox TV in Boston. We found that out.
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:07.000]  And I asked everybody, nobody used to go to the second floor. All of a sudden, it just happened.
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.000]  He's coming through the hallway and then he is up on the second floor. I said, what are you doing up here?
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:16.000]  He said, I'm looking for bleach. He said, so I can wash the dishes. I said, what?
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:21.000]  Who washes the dishes with bleach? A toxic chemical? Not in this office. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:25.000]  Fox News is a central intelligence agency, so you really got to watch them.
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:31.000]  The final segment will try to jam in a call or two for our guest at the Little Alamo in New Hampshire.
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:41.000]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands. My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:49.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:57.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British Intelligence.
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran. The White House broke it to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:15.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:52:46.000 --> 02:53:00.000]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the US government.
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:08.000]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions. It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step by step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  I hadn't wanted to talk about this until we were sure of it, and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  We have an ultra-massive guest scheduled tomorrow on the order or even greater than Charlie Sheen.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:04.000]  That's all I'm going to tell you. Concerns 9-11, and it's set. We'll see if it happens.
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:10.000]  Going back to Ed Brown. Ed?
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:12.000]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  Let's take two final calls here. That's okay. Dan in Ohio and Anthony in PA. Dan, go ahead.
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  Actually, this is Dave.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  Okay, Dave. We've got to move quick.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  Sir, I just wanted to say that I think that the core to this issue is the essential thing that we're fighting against, this control by banks and fiat currency.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  Yeah, we don't have a real court system. It's totally corrupt.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:50.000]  Yeah, well, they bought everything and they own everything. I hope Mr. Brown can fight them and win. I think that you guys rule. Thanks.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:52.000]  Thank you, sir. I appreciate the call.
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  Anthony in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  Hi, Alex. My name is Anthony from Pennsylvania. I'm a 22-year-old college student. I major in regional planning.
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:12.000]  And this week was the first week of classes and my teacher, the first sentence he said was that some of you may think regional planning is communist.
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:20.000]  And the second sentence he said was we're friends with them now. And I was utterly shocked, Alex.
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  Yeah, regional planning is total control grid, shutting down major roads, putting us in compact cities, thumb scanning to travel, total face scanners everywhere.
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  And you've got all the liberals thinking that it's a commie takeover. It's the banker takeover.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  And a comment for Ed. There's a wireless security camera. It's about $80 or night vision. Put those around. It should work.
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  And I had a problem with the sheriff of my town trying to get a concealed weapons permit.
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  I passed the security check and before he handed me a little piece of plastic, he goes, I bet you don't have a girlfriend, do you?
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  And I was just shocked.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:04.000]  Yeah, no, it's arrogant thug scum who hate us having guns. They want the monopoly of power.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  And so he makes an insult about your manhood because you wanted a gun. I appreciate your call.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:14.000]  Ed Brown, in closing, I want to salute you for all you've done. Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  No. All good men just come to the aid of their country.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:20.000]  Thank you.
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  Thank you, sir. What are you going to do? I mean, you said that they want a war they're going to have on. What are you going to do if that SWAT team comes down your front lawn?
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  I guess that's my statement, Alex. I've got to protect and defend my property.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.000]  His phone just dropped. That was interesting right there at the end.
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:42.000]  You almost lost me. I hit the button accidentally.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  Okay, you're back.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.000]  Okay, you're back.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  That's it. That's what I have to do. Protect and defend, that's it.
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  And the sentencing is next month?
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.000]  April something. Right around the tax time.
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  They might be planning to have you as some sacrificial lamb on that day to scare everybody.
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  I'm sure they are.
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000]  Look what we do. Look at the power we have. Do what we say.
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:08.000]  Star Wars.
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:10.000]  I know. Thank you, sir.
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  Hey, I appreciate you coming on. We'll talk soon. We'll stay in contact. We'll all pray for you, Ed Lewis-Brown and your wife, okay?
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  Appreciate it. Thank you, sir.
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  I want to thank all those that are going up there to support you and stand with you.
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  All right, we'll be back tonight night and midnight on the network, Genesis Communications Radio Network, often imitated, never duplicated.

[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:08.000]  You need to join us tomorrow because it'll be a grand slam, a royal flush, if we get this sucker in.

[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:35.000]  Alarming words for our time. But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:43.000]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron,
