[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:29.080]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Friday the 13th 2015 that's November 13
[00:29.080 --> 00:33.880]  I'm David Knight your host we're going to be joined in the show with Anthony
[00:33.880 --> 00:38.800]  Gutiarty is going to be coming on and talking about probably the issue with
[00:38.800 --> 00:42.360]  Monsanto that's coming up we've got a college student who is saying show us
[00:42.360 --> 00:47.880]  the studies that's precisely what we're asking for with climate change show us
[00:47.880 --> 00:53.920]  the models that accurately predict what you've been saying of course we do see
[00:53.920 --> 00:57.100]  many scientists who are questioning where the night it is man-made global
[00:57.100 --> 01:00.240]  warming as reported on the nightly news earlier this week and we're going to talk
[01:00.240 --> 01:06.080]  about this a little bit more the Sun is actually declining in activity that is
[01:06.080 --> 01:11.440]  a far bigger change on our environment than anything that man could do you need
[01:11.440 --> 01:14.400]  to understand that and you need to understand what's really behind this
[01:14.400 --> 01:18.040]  push you need to understand we're going to talk about climate depot Mark
[01:18.040 --> 01:21.800]  Moreno he's been a guest many times on the Alex Jones show talking about how
[01:21.800 --> 01:25.240]  this is the last chance they're telling everybody and they've been telling us
[01:25.240 --> 01:30.120]  this for a very long time every time they have a global climate summit it is
[01:30.120 --> 01:34.760]  the last chance to save the planet and of course they're saying that again this
[01:34.760 --> 01:40.600]  year but this truly is the last chance for us to stop global governance based
[01:40.600 --> 01:45.720]  on this lie based on this panic if we fail to get the people to understand
[01:45.720 --> 01:48.800]  what is going on with this so we're going to talk about what's really behind
[01:48.800 --> 01:52.480]  that of course there are three key things that are happening right now we see
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.800]  over the open borders that are going on in Europe we see an active movement to
[01:56.800 --> 02:01.840]  shut down cultures to shut down and destroy borders and quite frankly George
[02:01.840 --> 02:07.880]  Soros has been very upfront about it we have the Hungarian Prime Minister saying
[02:07.880 --> 02:12.760]  that this is a concerted effort by those on the left specifically talking about
[02:12.760 --> 02:17.000]  George Soros who is Hungarian himself and Hungarian Prime Minister says this is
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.560]  an effort to destroy the nations he says this plan treats the protection of
[02:22.560 --> 02:28.280]  natural borders as the objective and refugees as an article as an obstacle
[02:28.280 --> 02:32.800]  says Soros well you know that's not really what is going on when he says
[02:32.800 --> 02:38.800]  that he wants to take care of the refugees really he's using the
[02:38.800 --> 02:43.720]  refugees as a means his objective is global governance and he wants to get
[02:43.720 --> 02:48.120]  rid of national borders and George Soros says national borders are the
[02:48.120 --> 02:55.640]  obstacle understand that national borders and a culture and a contiguous
[02:55.640 --> 02:58.520]  people there that are not divided and fighting amongst themselves we're going
[02:58.520 --> 03:01.720]  to talk about what that is but that's the plan if you can get rid of the
[03:01.720 --> 03:05.120]  borders if you can get the people fighting amongst themselves then you
[03:05.120 --> 03:08.960]  have removed the obstacles as George Soros points out to global governance
[03:08.960 --> 03:14.920]  they can then remove other obstacles using climate treaties to control the
[03:14.920 --> 03:20.520]  economy or using these trade treaties like the TPP the TTIP to control the
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.960]  economy both of those treaties have structures that would allow them to
[03:24.960 --> 03:31.040]  create global governance to allow them to tax to regulate to have international
[03:31.040 --> 03:35.400]  courts that would be above the people so we're going to talk about that we're
[03:35.400 --> 03:38.360]  going to talk about the back and forth that happened between Donald Trump and
[03:38.360 --> 03:42.320]  Rand Paul in terms of talking about TPP and China I think it's very important
[03:42.320 --> 03:46.160]  that we get this right that we understand what's really going on here and
[03:46.160 --> 03:50.800]  of course we're going to have reporters from the nightly news joining me Joe
[03:50.800 --> 03:54.800]  Biggs and McAdoo Jacarie Jackson we're going to be talking about their reports
[03:54.800 --> 04:00.240]  their coverage of these university protests that happened yesterday saying
[04:00.240 --> 04:04.280]  that they want to have free college we're also going to talk about the report
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.360]  earlier this week about a media graveyard the report that was on the drudge
[04:08.360 --> 04:13.880]  report daily newspapers are down nearly 80% and hard news is in danger well
[04:13.880 --> 04:18.720]  we're going to talk about that what is hard news what is real news is there
[04:18.720 --> 04:23.360]  some kind of objective neutral reporting that happens that's what we've been
[04:23.360 --> 04:26.840]  told they say that this is going to possibly return back to what we've had
[04:26.840 --> 04:32.320]  200 years ago opinion journalism well you know what when I look back 200 years
[04:32.320 --> 04:35.840]  ago that was a time the founders were around it seemed to me like we had a
[04:35.840 --> 04:40.240]  pretty educated pretty sharp populace because they questioned what they were
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.320]  told they did their own research nobody presented themselves as being
[04:44.320 --> 04:47.080]  objective as having all the answers so we're going to talk about that we're
[04:47.080 --> 04:50.320]  going to take a look at the back and forth between Bill O'Reilly and George
[04:50.320 --> 04:53.440]  will that's the reporters coming up later in the show we'll be right back with
[04:53.440 --> 04:55.800]  more news
[04:55.800 --> 05:04.240]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com Rand Paul calls Obama an idiot on foreign
[05:04.240 --> 05:08.760]  policy what kind of idiot sends four people to war in a campaign stop in
[05:08.760 --> 05:13.280]  Iowa yesterday senator Rand Paul had some choice words for the president
[05:13.280 --> 05:18.760]  labeling him an idiot over his handling of the situation in Syria Bravo Rand Paul
[05:18.760 --> 05:23.280]  Bravo speaking to the crowd on military and foreign policy Paul asked what kind
[05:23.280 --> 05:27.920]  of idiot sends four people to war the senator was referring to Obama's
[05:27.920 --> 05:32.920]  monumental fail and attempting to train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS the program
[05:32.920 --> 05:39.120]  cost an estimated $500 million but was aborted as it was revealed that just
[05:39.120 --> 05:44.480]  four or five trainers remained from an initial 54 if you go to war you don't go
[05:44.480 --> 05:48.600]  with underwhelming force you go to war with overwhelming force Paul further
[05:48.600 --> 05:53.240]  explained Paul also spoke on arming the rebels calling it crazy foolish to feed

[08:15.520 --> 08:19.720]  GCN radio network
[08:22.280 --> 08:26.400]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Friday November 13th 2015 I'm
[08:26.400 --> 08:30.880]  David Knight your host gonna be joined later in the show of our reporters
[08:30.880 --> 08:36.080]  Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, Leanne McAdoo we're gonna be talking about is hard
[08:36.080 --> 08:40.840]  news really dying what is the nature of journalism is opinion journalism a bad
[08:40.840 --> 08:45.120]  thing do we really have objective journalism so we're gonna talk about
[08:45.120 --> 08:49.640]  that and take a look at the internal dispute that is getting hotter and hotter
[08:49.640 --> 08:53.640]  all the time between Bill O'Reilly and George Will because I think it touches on
[08:53.640 --> 08:57.960]  it's interesting theater actually folks watch them go back and forth at each
[08:57.960 --> 09:03.200]  other maybe a little bit of shade and Florida but anyway it's they raise some
[09:03.200 --> 09:08.320]  interesting points about what constitutes real research where do you get your facts
[09:08.320 --> 09:11.760]  how do you vet the information how should this be presented they're also
[09:11.760 --> 09:15.800]  going to be talking about students marching across the US demanding that
[09:15.800 --> 09:20.520]  they get a free government college education I think that's pretty amazing
[09:20.520 --> 09:26.480]  you know quite frankly when I went to college the tuition was less than the
[09:26.480 --> 09:33.120]  books I went to the University of South Florida and you could afford to work a
[09:33.120 --> 09:37.500]  part-time job because you could get jobs then as a kid we didn't have the
[09:37.500 --> 09:41.040]  borders open and have adults coming across the border from third-world
[09:41.040 --> 09:45.200]  countries to work at minimum wage keeping students from getting jobs and you
[09:45.200 --> 09:49.000]  could afford the tuition but what's happened is over the decades tuition is
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.760]  gradually risen because of government subsidy whenever you subsidize
[09:53.760 --> 09:57.760]  something you make it less efficient you know what we ought to do we ought to
[09:57.760 --> 10:01.880]  have a requirement for anybody going into college they ought to first be able
[10:01.880 --> 10:05.000]  just as they have to have certain minimum entrance exams I think they ought to
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.800]  have to show that they understand economics and how it applies to their
[10:10.800 --> 10:13.720]  personal life in terms of getting a degree well but that would that would
[10:13.720 --> 10:16.840]  work against what the colleges want isn't it and I'm not talking about
[10:16.840 --> 10:21.240]  macroeconomics that's a bunch of nonsense okay the fact that that's what
[10:21.240 --> 10:25.000]  they use to push Keynesian economics that's all macroeconomics and money that
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.600]  we owe to ourselves really doesn't matter baloney baloney because that money
[10:28.600 --> 10:32.560]  isn't money that we owe to ourselves anymore it's money that we owe to China
[10:32.560 --> 10:36.520]  because they bought our debt from the Federal Reserve so yeah it'd be
[10:36.520 --> 10:41.080]  interesting to know if the kids really understand what they're going for I mean
[10:41.080 --> 10:46.640]  there's a quote here in this article I want to graduate without debt community
[10:46.640 --> 10:50.960]  college has been kind to me but if I want to go on I have to take on debt
[10:50.960 --> 10:55.280]  well you know maybe that college that community college degree isn't going to
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.560]  really be worth anything to you you have to live in the real world you have to
[10:59.560 --> 11:03.760]  look at what this is really the value of this degree that you're getting there's
[11:03.760 --> 11:06.760]  some degrees that are very valuable economically and then there's others
[11:06.760 --> 11:10.880]  that are totally worthless and you're accumulating this massive debt and
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.000]  there's absolutely no reason to think that you're going to get anything from
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.140]  it economically but what they want to do is they want to make their debt your
[11:19.140 --> 11:25.200]  debt and it's not just that they want this opened up for everyone they say we
[11:25.200 --> 11:31.160]  want people of all color all genders all sexual orientations and we're united
[11:31.160 --> 11:34.400]  to fight for education as a human right well you know what they need to add to
[11:34.400 --> 11:40.280]  that all nationalities people from every country in the world are going to come
[11:40.280 --> 11:43.040]  here and demand that they get a free ride you don't think that's going to
[11:43.040 --> 11:46.800]  happen look at the fact that we have illegal aliens coming in this country
[11:46.800 --> 11:52.400]  and getting in-state tuition rates right now right now that are American
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.160]  students whose parents have lived here and paid taxes all their life cannot
[11:56.160 --> 11:59.960]  get a preferential tax rate if they want to go from one state to another they
[11:59.960 --> 12:03.040]  have to pay the higher rate because they didn't pay taxes in that other state
[12:03.040 --> 12:06.800]  you understand you get a lower rate if you're resident because you've been
[12:06.800 --> 12:09.880]  paying taxes to support that state university system but if you go to
[12:09.880 --> 12:13.180]  another state they don't give you that lower rate because you haven't been
[12:13.180 --> 12:17.120]  paying that but if you're an illegal alien you can go to any state in the
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.280]  union and get in-state tuition and so what this is there's a couple of things
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.760]  involved with this one of them is the clout and piven takedown of this country
[12:25.760 --> 12:29.560]  expanding the entitlement state accelerating the takedown of the country
[12:29.560 --> 12:34.640]  the other thing is the government wants you to stay in college they want you to
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.200]  stay in their system they want you from kindergarten from time you're a three-year
[12:39.200 --> 12:43.520]  old when you can barely talk until you're in your mid 30s preferably okay
[12:43.520 --> 12:49.080]  they want you to stay in there as long as possible and then as a condition to
[12:49.080 --> 12:52.880]  pay for your education they want you to take some kind of government service
[12:52.880 --> 12:55.640]  job or work for the government they don't want you to ever get out of that
[12:55.640 --> 13:00.120]  government bubble they not only want to completely train you from cradle to
[13:00.120 --> 13:04.800]  grave and you know look understand everybody has understood this you
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.800]  don't even need to keep people in school until they're in their mid 20s or
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.960]  early 30s in order to completely brainwash them into a way of thinking
[13:13.960 --> 13:18.520]  you can do that in much less time that was what Plato was talking about in his
[13:18.520 --> 13:22.360]  Republic he wanted to get rid of the families and he wanted to keep people
[13:22.360 --> 13:26.960]  under the rule of the thumb he wanted them to see the the state as their
[13:26.960 --> 13:30.760]  family not even to know who their mother and father were to get them at an
[13:30.760 --> 13:34.640]  early age and raise them by the state that's how you control the population
[13:34.640 --> 13:39.160]  that's how you take over the next generation and that has been the dream of
[13:39.160 --> 13:44.520]  socialists from the very beginning just look at this school to homeschoolers
[13:44.520 --> 13:48.560]  sign up or face criminal charges this is WND they're talking about homeschool
[13:48.560 --> 13:52.000]  parents in Florida this is a story that was put out by the homeschool legal
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.120]  defense association if you are a homeschooler you need to be involved with
[13:56.120 --> 14:01.080]  HSLDA because they are the ones who are going to be there for you who have your
[14:01.080 --> 14:07.080]  back when some activist local politician decides that they're going to create a
[14:07.080 --> 14:10.200]  new rule which is what happened in this Florida County they're going to
[14:10.200 --> 14:14.560]  unilaterally create this new rule that they have absolutely no authority for
[14:14.560 --> 14:18.920]  and you don't have any responsibility to obey them but understand that if you
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.560]  don't you're going to have men with guns at your door to take your kids and to
[14:23.560 --> 14:27.480]  kill you if you don't turn them over and that really has happened to homeschoolers
[14:27.480 --> 14:31.520]  in the early days that happened quite frequently before we started organizing
[14:31.520 --> 14:34.760]  with a legal defense association listen to the details of this is little
[14:34.760 --> 14:40.560]  County Santa Rosa County in Florida they sent out letters demanding that
[14:40.560 --> 14:44.400]  parents give them information that the parents are not required to provide under
[14:44.400 --> 14:47.520]  Florida state law the information included things like social security
[14:47.520 --> 14:51.400]  number race grade level the parents also received a letter demanding they
[14:51.400 --> 14:55.400]  comply with new district policy requiring them to show proof of
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.640]  residency and to prove that they no longer were registered in whatever
[14:59.640 --> 15:03.560]  district they most recently had been registered under now HSLDA sent their
[15:03.560 --> 15:07.480]  staff attorney and they said look Florida law does not require proof of
[15:07.480 --> 15:12.720]  residency or any of this new information that you are demanding they say the
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.480]  parents are bluntly told the district will be terminating your request to file
[15:17.480 --> 15:21.440]  your intent to homeschool and Santa Rosa County School District you know what
[15:21.440 --> 15:26.960]  homeschooled my kid scared both of all of my kids both my sons who are now out
[15:26.960 --> 15:31.160]  of school my daughter who's still in school I don't request information to
[15:31.160 --> 15:36.320]  educate my children I don't request I don't respond to demands from the
[15:36.320 --> 15:40.280]  government about my children they're my children and I don't request anything
[15:40.280 --> 15:43.960]  from the government they don't belong to the government they belong to me I
[15:43.960 --> 15:48.640]  haven't gotten over that quaint notion you know that Melissa Harris Perry says
[15:48.640 --> 15:51.560]  we should get over anyway they say you got three days to register your children
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.480]  in a public or a private school if you don't you will be in violation of
[15:55.480 --> 15:59.440]  compulsory attendance laws so forth and so on so they sent a letter out to the
[15:59.440 --> 16:03.640]  attorney he refused to acknowledge to accept that the Florida Department of
[16:03.640 --> 16:08.480]  Education denies local school districts authority to add to the home
[16:08.480 --> 16:13.000]  education law or to listen to the fact that the HSLDA has opposed all other
[16:13.000 --> 16:18.880]  district attempts at similar requirements now this is a one county this
[16:18.880 --> 16:23.400]  is one state but you may run into that wherever you are anywhere where there's
[16:23.400 --> 16:27.120]  a petty fogging bureaucrat who thinks that he should run your life you can
[16:27.120 --> 16:31.000]  run into that sort of thing that's why we need to stand together we need to
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.320]  unite issue by issue we need to get active at the local level and that's why
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.600]  this this you know that the presidential race is interesting because there's some
[16:41.600 --> 16:46.360]  interesting and there's some big topics like the Trans-Pacific Partnership like
[16:46.360 --> 16:52.640]  the treaty to establish global governance based on climate change these are big
[16:52.640 --> 16:57.520]  overriding issues and we watch the candidates debate these issues understand
[16:57.520 --> 17:02.880]  that they are surrogates for the people who are the real government so it's
[17:02.880 --> 17:06.480]  interesting however to watch how these surrogates make the arguments it's also
[17:06.480 --> 17:09.880]  interesting when things get a little bit tough like they did with Marco Rubio to
[17:09.880 --> 17:14.400]  watch how they fall back to their prepared statements you can really get a
[17:14.400 --> 17:18.840]  glimpse of what's going on with these people and really understand what's
[17:18.840 --> 17:23.280]  going on you need to think globally because they're thinking and planning
[17:23.280 --> 17:26.000]  globally you need to understand where they're headed with all this and that's
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.520]  what's valuable about watching the presidential debates about watching
[17:29.520 --> 17:34.200]  these people talk but you also need to understand that it is at the local level
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.720]  when they come for your kids with the sheriff and when we're talking about that
[17:39.720 --> 17:45.360]  let me let me go to this story now about this this rancher that was shot we first
[17:45.360 --> 17:49.320]  reported what the official story was which was that there was some kind of a
[17:49.320 --> 17:54.000]  shootout they didn't know why this happened this is a case in Idaho where
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.720]  a bull was this is open-range territory so the animals are roaming around or
[17:59.720 --> 18:03.760]  he got out of a fenced in area nevertheless he was hit by a car he
[18:03.760 --> 18:07.000]  gets a call at the dinner table they say come down you got to take care of this
[18:07.000 --> 18:15.000]  bull and we were told that this resulted in some kind of a shootout between two
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.400]  deputies and the rancher who came down with the bull and then subsequently the
[18:19.400 --> 18:24.360]  wife had a heart attack and nearly died there's been a little bit of time now and
[18:24.360 --> 18:30.440]  some local reporters at the Idaho paper let's see which paper is this is the
[18:30.440 --> 18:36.040]  Idaho Idaho statement went down and interviewed people there and they've
[18:36.040 --> 18:41.480]  had a meeting with the sheriff the community there over 200 people in this
[18:41.480 --> 18:45.880]  small community grill the sheriff on why deputies gunned down the Idaho rancher
[18:45.880 --> 18:52.240]  this is a story that but on Salazar had two days ago and I really want to look
[18:52.240 --> 18:57.080]  at this in detail we don't really have time for it right now but I'm gonna talk
[18:57.080 --> 19:01.400]  about this in detail when we come back let's play that clip guys that the
[19:01.400 --> 19:06.920]  video clip that we've got of this jack's just a well-known rancher who's been
[19:06.920 --> 19:13.040]  here for 62 years born and raised here the community of counsel Idaho was
[19:13.040 --> 19:17.800]  coping with the loss of a well-known rancher jack yantis shot and killed by
[19:17.800 --> 19:21.760]  deputies Sunday night shortly after being notified about a bull from his
[19:21.760 --> 19:27.200]  ranch being hit by a car on highway 95 police say the bull was giving emergency
[19:27.200 --> 19:31.240]  cruise problems as they try to rescue the victims of the car accident at the
[19:31.240 --> 19:38.160]  bull became aggressive was charging vehicles first responders okay let's
[19:38.160 --> 19:40.800]  hold it right there because we have to go to a commercial break and we're gonna
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.160]  play some more of that for you but we're only gonna break down what happened
[19:44.160 --> 19:48.600]  based on what eyewitnesses are saying and the way the government is reacting
[19:48.600 --> 19:53.040]  and let me ask you this where are black lives matter with this and what does this
[19:53.040 --> 19:57.720]  tell us about the whole black lives matter movement and about what's going
[19:57.720 --> 20:03.480]  on our police stay with us to be right back earthquake floods winter storms
[20:03.480 --> 20:07.560]  prolonged power outages or war each of us have had that moment when we
[20:07.560 --> 20:11.520]  recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing
[20:11.520 --> 20:15.120]  we start with food storage then we address the need for water but have you
[20:15.120 --> 20:19.400]  considered heat storage I'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are
[20:19.400 --> 20:23.560]  some things for you to consider how will I keep my family warm the standard
[20:23.560 --> 20:27.160]  answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be
[20:27.160 --> 20:32.280]  on the move is you can't take it with you another concern there may come a time
[20:32.280 --> 20:35.920]  when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even
[20:35.920 --> 20:40.640]  come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly
[20:40.640 --> 20:45.600]  than you think for these answers go to fortress clothing comm again fortress
[20:45.600 --> 20:50.400]  clothing comm has the answers to your heat storage dilemma don't get stuck in

[21:08.160 --> 21:13.880]  lose control when this happens it will rip our country apart in ways you never
[21:13.880 --> 21:18.440]  imagined from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you
[21:18.440 --> 21:22.320]  want to protect look I've made predictions like this before a few years
[21:22.320 --> 21:26.920]  ago I warned that the housing prices would collapse before that I warned that
[21:26.920 --> 21:31.960]  dot-com companies would crash and they did those who listened had a chance to
[21:31.960 --> 21:36.280]  save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will

[23:58.200 --> 24:09.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host gonna go back
[24:09.800 --> 24:14.240]  and talk about this Idaho shooting about the that we've all around this bull
[24:14.240 --> 24:20.280]  that got hit by a car the rancher who was killed in that and the meeting that
[24:20.280 --> 24:24.960]  happened this week because this has a lot to do with the changes that we've
[24:24.960 --> 24:29.600]  seen in the police and black lives matter is not involved in this this is a
[24:29.600 --> 24:34.720]  rural area I think everybody is white and this rural area of Idaho if this
[24:34.720 --> 24:38.720]  happened and you can when we go over the details of this you will see a lot of
[24:38.720 --> 24:42.920]  similarities to what's going on in the inner cities the difference is that you
[24:42.920 --> 24:46.760]  have a black population there and I understand that the black population has
[24:46.760 --> 24:52.280]  been the victim of these new rules of engagement that they have created for
[24:52.280 --> 24:57.080]  the police far more than other people have but we need to stand together
[24:57.080 --> 25:02.000]  instead of subdividing people and saying that this is simply a racism issue it
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.320]  is not simply a racism issue it would be a lot easier to fix if that were the
[25:06.320 --> 25:10.280]  case this is something we have to understand what the problem is before
[25:10.280 --> 25:15.000]  we can possibly fix it and so we're gonna talk about that and and I think I
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.360]  want to talk to you about the kind of subliminal slip that came out of Chris
[25:20.360 --> 25:25.880]  Christie on Veterans Day essentially alluding to the fact that he believes
[25:25.880 --> 25:29.960]  that law enforcement in this country are also veterans and that they are under
[25:29.960 --> 25:34.200]  the command of the president and that didn't get much exposure we're gonna
[25:34.200 --> 25:37.240]  talk about that as well so I've got a lot to talk about with that I want to do
[25:37.240 --> 25:41.800]  that in the next segment I'll cover some news some breaking news that's on other
[25:41.800 --> 25:45.360]  issues in this shorter segment before I do I just want to let you know about a
[25:45.360 --> 25:48.840]  new product and a new special that we have we have a new product living
[25:48.840 --> 25:54.640]  defense at Info Wars life this is it's clear that statistics say that nine out

[26:31.440 --> 26:37.440]  at info wars life calm and on special at 20% off let's take a quick look and what
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.960]  we have left of this shorter segment some news is coming out some economic news
[26:41.960 --> 26:46.240]  the government has added a record 339 billion dollars to the debt the very
[26:46.240 --> 26:50.600]  first day after they raised the debt ceiling about that you know that was
[26:50.600 --> 26:55.760]  going to last us for two years I was going to go on to 2017 and one day they
[26:55.760 --> 27:04.400]  added 339 billion dollars to the total debt so that's we're seeing this growing
[27:04.400 --> 27:07.880]  at an accelerating rate they point out the government ran a deficit of 136
[27:07.880 --> 27:12.440]  billion dollars last month that's up 12% compared to the previous October
[27:12.440 --> 27:17.000]  spending ballooned taxes remained essentially flat the worst October
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.840]  since 2010 when the government was still spending on the stimulus and was at
[27:21.840 --> 27:25.080]  pace for a deficit of more than a trillion dollars that year that's a
[27:25.080 --> 27:29.800]  Washington Times point that out I would say that maybe the stimulus would be
[27:29.800 --> 27:35.480]  part of the bailout to the bankers and of course we've got Apple's CEO Tim Cook
[27:35.480 --> 27:42.200]  saying that cash is going to die he made a very bold prediction in the UK he told
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.100]  the students at Trinity College in Dublin he said your kids will not know
[27:46.100 --> 27:50.800]  what money is well you know when I look at this economic news about adding
[27:50.800 --> 27:55.080]  339 billion dollars a debt in one day I say well maybe we don't know what money
[27:55.080 --> 27:59.840]  is either okay but he's saying you're they're not going to have any experience
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.720]  with cash he thinks that he's going to take over and get a cut just like the
[28:04.720 --> 28:07.760]  Federal Reserve gets a cut isn't that going to be great you know we've got
[28:07.760 --> 28:12.520]  these designing people all over Silicon Valley Apple wants to take over the money
[28:12.520 --> 28:17.320]  and all purchases and we've got Google that wants to take over your car they
[28:17.320 --> 28:22.280]  want to drive your car for you we this is an interesting article that was up on
[28:22.280 --> 28:27.400]  the drug report Google self-driving car pulled over for driving too slowly now
[28:27.400 --> 28:31.960]  there's a cop after my own heart pulling a car over for going to slowly and
[28:31.960 --> 28:35.080]  holding up traffic want to Google self-driving vehicles pulled over who
[28:35.080 --> 28:38.920]  gets a ticket they ask the passenger or the car the vehicle was traveling 24
[28:38.920 --> 28:43.560]  miles an hour in a 35 mile an hour zone and I've read articles about how fed up
[28:43.560 --> 28:49.160]  people are following these stupid clown cars around sitting at a stop sign a
[28:49.160 --> 28:54.280]  four-way stop sign one guy and this is a reporter that was writing in the Google
[28:54.280 --> 28:59.080]  car he said yeah we were there for five minutes waiting for the Google car to
[28:59.080 --> 29:04.560]  feel safe about crossing in this four-way stop and finally an old guy with
[29:04.560 --> 29:09.560]  white hair pulled around us honked his horn sware swore at us shot us a bird
[29:09.560 --> 29:14.720]  and went on it's like you think you think and I wasn't out there okay that
[29:14.720 --> 29:19.280]  wasn't me but understand these things and I forget what the exact total is
[29:19.280 --> 29:24.320]  something like three or four times the number of accidents that humans have
[29:24.320 --> 29:30.240]  have been Google cars but of course they tell us oh it's not our fault look when
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.240]  you drive the way these cars drive you create accidents you have to understand
[29:34.240 --> 29:37.480]  that it doesn't speed that creates accidents it's differences in speed
[29:37.480 --> 29:41.280]  it's the careless stupid way these things are driving stay with us we'll be
[29:41.280 --> 29:56.680]  right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.120 --> 30:05.640]  new report expects a million cancer deaths from Fukushima fallout under
[30:05.640 --> 30:12.720]  estimated and under reported article up at info wars.com by Christian Sarek in a
[30:12.720 --> 30:19.440]  new report published by fair winds energy education or FEE cancer is on the rise
[30:19.440 --> 30:25.240]  in post Fukushima Japan we learned that the ongoing multi-core nuclear meltdown
[30:25.240 --> 30:31.000]  at the Fukushima plant has produced approximately 230 times higher than
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.080]  normal thyroid cancers in Fukushima prefecture and could result in as many
[30:37.080 --> 30:43.440]  as one million more cancers due to the incident that happened in March of 2011
[30:43.440 --> 30:48.600]  five years later and we are still getting a grip on how catastrophic Fukushima
[30:48.600 --> 30:54.120]  truly was to this planet and its people you can read more about this at info

[32:58.320 --> 33:13.440]  Waging War on Corruption it's Alex Jones
[33:13.440 --> 33:20.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host this hour we're
[33:20.200 --> 33:23.480]  gonna be joined later in the show it's actually in the next hour we're gonna be
[33:23.480 --> 33:27.880]  joined by the rest of the Nightly News crew pretty much so the reporters Joe
[33:27.880 --> 33:32.000]  Biggs, Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo will be coming in we'll be talking about what
[33:32.000 --> 33:38.040]  is real media is real media disappearing this is a report that was on the
[33:38.040 --> 33:42.160]  drudge report earlier this week daily newspapers down nearly 80% hard news is
[33:42.160 --> 33:49.240]  in danger is it really are we going to be suffering from confusing opinion
[33:49.240 --> 33:53.880]  journalism like we had 200 years ago when the country was founded is that a
[33:53.880 --> 33:56.800]  good thing or is that a bad thing we're gonna talk about that we're also going to
[33:56.800 --> 34:02.040]  talk about the back-and-forth between Bill O'Reilly and George Will on Bill
[34:02.040 --> 34:06.000]  O'Reilly's book killing Reagan I think it's a very entertaining exchange back
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.040]  and forth between these two guys got very heated they've continued to attack
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.720]  each other in the press but it brings up some interesting concepts underlying
[34:16.720 --> 34:21.880]  all of this and that is what do you do to vet your sources how do you determine
[34:21.880 --> 34:26.480]  if your information is accurate or not who do you talk to so it has some real
[34:26.480 --> 34:29.480]  important issues underneath it but it is also very entertaining we're also going
[34:29.480 --> 34:34.400]  to be talking about the reports and there they went to several of the
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.400]  marches students who are saying that they want a free public college so we're
[34:40.400 --> 34:45.120]  going to talk about that and we're also going to have Anthony Guterres joining us
[34:45.120 --> 34:51.520]  in the third hour talking about news I mentioned earlier this story in Idaho
[34:51.520 --> 34:56.280]  where the deputies shot a rancher and I want to go down the details that have
[34:56.280 --> 34:59.520]  now come out because the story has changed and I think this is something
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.600]  that is very important for us to look at because there have been giant radical
[35:04.600 --> 35:09.360]  changes in the way the police interact with the communities throughout this
[35:09.360 --> 35:15.200]  country not just in the cities not just against black people this is universal
[35:15.200 --> 35:19.120]  it's being driven from Washington we have hammered this point here at Info
[35:19.120 --> 35:25.120]  Wars relentlessly this is a national agenda it is part of nationalizing the
[35:25.120 --> 35:30.520]  police and this is a shoot first curriculum as one of the New Mexico
[35:30.520 --> 35:34.560]  instructors at the State Police Academy said I'm not going to shoot I'm not
[35:34.560 --> 35:37.720]  going to teach this new curriculum because it's a shoot first curriculum I
[35:37.720 --> 35:42.160]  refuse to teach this it's a very different way that the police are
[35:42.160 --> 35:45.600]  interacting with people than they used to in the past and it's being driven by
[35:45.600 --> 35:51.680]  Washington like one evidence of this was after the debate on was actually on
[35:51.680 --> 35:57.120]  Wednesday Chris Christie was talking about Veterans Day and he was talking
[35:57.120 --> 36:00.760]  about how Hillary Clinton had disrespected veterans by saying she
[36:00.760 --> 36:03.680]  didn't really think that the VA situation was that much of a problem he says
[36:03.680 --> 36:10.360]  you're disrespecting the veterans and when Obama disrespects law officers he
[36:10.360 --> 36:16.960]  has no authority to command them those law enforcement officers in uniform he
[36:16.960 --> 36:22.080]  put those two things together in his mind understand that Chris Christie does
[36:22.080 --> 36:27.600]  think that he's at war with the American people a drug war among other things but
[36:27.600 --> 36:33.600]  I thought it was very telling that in his mind he sees the president as the
[36:33.600 --> 36:37.400]  commander-in-chief of the law enforcement officers in uniform in this
[36:37.400 --> 36:42.160]  country that he sees them as veterans in a war a war against two well that would
[36:42.160 --> 36:47.520]  be us those of us that they feel that they can command in any way they feel
[36:47.520 --> 36:51.000]  that they don't have to respond with information that's precisely what
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.400]  happened in the meeting with these residents in Council Idaho now let me
[36:57.400 --> 37:00.640]  give you some of the facts as we are now starting to see them and the two
[37:00.640 --> 37:04.520]  different sides of the story that have emerged and as you're listening to this
[37:04.520 --> 37:09.320]  ask yourself if this was in the city if this was the cops against a black
[37:09.320 --> 37:15.440]  individual wouldn't we hear that this is all about racism racism racism racism
[37:15.440 --> 37:18.960]  that's all they would want to talk about black lives matter would be there and
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.520]  that would be the only thing they'd want to talk about but understand that this
[37:23.520 --> 37:27.600]  event even though it's a bull even though it's out in the country that the bull
[37:27.600 --> 37:32.520]  started it it wasn't overselling loose cigarettes on the sidewalk it was about
[37:32.520 --> 37:37.640]  a bull that had been hit by a car understand that there wasn't any law
[37:37.640 --> 37:43.320]  broken here even but a man died because of the way the police have been trained
[37:43.320 --> 37:47.560]  to interact with the public and so understand as you're listening to the
[37:47.560 --> 37:51.760]  details of this compare this to what you've seen in the public and in the
[37:51.760 --> 37:56.560]  cities and understand that this is not a problem of racism as black lives matter
[37:56.560 --> 38:01.520]  as George Soros would like to balkanize us into different tribes to keep us from
[38:01.520 --> 38:05.200]  doing anything about this to address the root cause of that and if you're
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.600]  looking at this you can see this is the location where everybody was based on
[38:09.600 --> 38:14.200]  eyewitness report so you can kind of leave that up there as I'm going through
[38:14.200 --> 38:17.880]  this report here for people want to see how everybody was placed there they say
[38:17.880 --> 38:22.080]  over 200 residents from the town of council voiced concerns over the death
[38:22.080 --> 38:26.600]  of Jack Antis I'm reading from an info wars article that was on Wednesday from
[38:26.600 --> 38:29.960]  Adam Salazar angered residents grill sheriff on why deputies gunned down
[38:29.960 --> 38:34.320]  Idaho Rancher if you want to find that on our website says they left the
[38:34.320 --> 38:37.960]  assembly angry over the answers that the county sheriff gave them they said
[38:37.960 --> 38:42.160]  police first claimed that yantis 62 years old engaged in a firefight with
[38:42.160 --> 38:46.640]  sheriff's deputies but yantis' daughter Sarah says there was no such gunfight
[38:46.640 --> 38:50.680]  instead called the altercation a senseless murder the result of police
[38:50.680 --> 38:56.000]  needlessly escalating the situation she said she told the Idaho statement there
[38:56.000 --> 39:02.040]  was no shootout this was a senseless murder now if you're looking at this map
[39:02.040 --> 39:05.720]  what happened was they called him from his dinner table said his bowl had been
[39:05.720 --> 39:10.120]  hit by a car the bull had a broken leg it was not going to survive it had to be
[39:10.120 --> 39:17.800]  put down so what they did was they they actually the son-in-law says that he
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.760]  was there at the time and he said he was getting together the truck and loading
[39:23.760 --> 39:26.480]  that up but he said the deputy started shooting at the bull at least one of
[39:26.480 --> 39:30.040]  them had a semi-automatic rifle perhaps an AR-15 he said they opened up with
[39:30.040 --> 39:35.440]  their pistols and with their M16s before Jack the rancher got there he says
[39:35.440 --> 39:42.240]  that's inhumane this is a two-ton angus bull that is angry hurt psychotic it was
[39:42.240 --> 39:46.080]  blazing down there and it sounded like World War three on this bull because they
[39:46.080 --> 39:50.000]  got him charging at everyone again so they just made the situation worse by
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.640]  shooting him not trying to put him down so they say Jack yantis gets there he
[39:54.640 --> 39:58.040]  knows how to put the bull down with one shot in the back of the head he's
[39:58.040 --> 40:02.240]  standing about four feet from the bull aiming the rifle at the back of the
[40:02.240 --> 40:06.720]  bull's head his back was to two deputies who were standing in the far lane
[40:06.720 --> 40:11.920]  facing each other as if they were having a conversation at that point the son-in-law
[40:11.920 --> 40:16.720]  Paris says I put the skid loaders lights on the hem and the bull lined up to shoot
[40:16.720 --> 40:19.920]  the bull in the back of the head put him out humanely says everything was going
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.040]  his plan then one cop turned around and grabbed the ranchers shoulders and
[40:24.040 --> 40:28.760]  jerked him back he says he's not sure if the ranchers weapon accidentally just
[40:28.760 --> 40:32.440]  charged at this point or if the gun fired when the deputies bullet struck the
[40:32.440 --> 40:37.360]  rifle and yantis his hand regardless one deputy began shooting at yantis then
[40:37.360 --> 40:41.400]  the other deputy started shooting yantis fell to the ground injured from gun
[40:41.400 --> 40:46.640]  shots to the chest and to the abdomen now his wife is also there as well as his
[40:46.640 --> 40:52.280]  son-in-law she suffered a heart attack she said to the media that she was
[40:52.280 --> 40:55.440]  mistreated by the officers after watching her husband shot she said they
[40:55.440 --> 40:59.400]  tried to run to his aid as he fell hit they shot him in the chest he falls to
[40:59.400 --> 41:03.160]  the ground he's bleeding they try to run she says they threatened then threatened
[41:03.160 --> 41:07.120]  me and my nephew they threw us in the middle of highway 95 they searched us
[41:07.120 --> 41:11.480]  they handcuffed us they wouldn't let us go and take care of Jack and they
[41:11.480 --> 41:18.200]  wouldn't call any ambulance to the scene now think about that situation where
[41:18.200 --> 41:22.680]  you had the the rookie and the cop and they were going up and down the stairway
[41:22.680 --> 41:28.880]  and stairwell in a New York apartment project low-income government
[41:28.880 --> 41:32.640]  apartment project and so they have police patrolling because it's a high crime
[41:32.640 --> 41:38.800]  area and a man and his girlfriend or wife opened the door of the stairwell
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.480]  and walk in and the one of the cops immediately pulls out a gun and shoots
[41:43.480 --> 41:49.320]  him in the chest as the guy is laying there bleeding out they call the union
[41:49.320 --> 41:53.320]  the police union not an ambulance they don't try to offer any assistance
[41:53.320 --> 41:58.840]  themselves they don't even call for help they call their union reps and say hey I
[41:58.840 --> 42:03.240]  shot a guy because they know that they did the wrong thing and what you've got
[42:03.240 --> 42:09.520]  going on there now that was that was a cop who was not black who shot a black
[42:09.520 --> 42:13.680]  man and killed him and let him bleed out in the stairwell so it's about racism
[42:13.680 --> 42:18.400]  well where's the racism in this exactly the same types of things we see
[42:18.400 --> 42:21.960]  happening just minor variations is a rural setting instead of a city setting
[42:21.960 --> 42:28.000]  but still the cops use excessive force shooting first and then let the people
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.560]  who are shot bleed out without even calling any help it is not about race
[42:33.560 --> 42:39.000]  it is about it there is an element of racism and things understand but it is
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.840]  fundamentally about the differences in the way the police have been trained and
[42:42.840 --> 42:47.840]  unless we come together black and white and stop this they're gonna continue to
[42:47.840 --> 42:51.600]  keep killing us now they have a meeting they pull everybody together the
[42:51.600 --> 42:54.560]  sheriff was asked whether the deputies were bringing body cameras he says well
[42:54.560 --> 42:57.840]  I don't know if the body cameras were recording the incident this has been over
[42:57.840 --> 43:03.480]  a week he doesn't know he doesn't know and as they pointed out look I pay taxes
[43:03.480 --> 43:08.560]  for these body cameras therefore our protection and for the deputies protection
[43:08.560 --> 43:13.040]  if they're not doing the wrong thing this is absolutely insane but we see
[43:13.040 --> 43:19.120]  this everywhere from rural Idaho to New York City the center of the city this
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.680]  is because it is a federal agenda the way they are training the police to
[43:23.680 --> 43:27.440]  interact with the public and this is what we really have to be concerned about
[43:27.440 --> 43:31.960]  now in this particular case I think things are gonna happen out there because
[43:31.960 --> 43:37.360]  unlike the city where people are polarized and think it's because of who
[43:37.360 --> 43:42.000]  they are or don't care because it's not their group see if you tell people this
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.360]  is all about the police going after black people you know what there's a lot of
[43:45.360 --> 43:47.960]  people who are going to look at this quite frankly and say well I'm not black
[43:47.960 --> 43:53.480]  so I don't care you're not going to get this situation solved if you make it
[43:53.480 --> 43:58.160]  about race and of course George Soros and the people who are pushing black
[43:58.160 --> 44:01.600]  lives matter as well as the government police organizations don't want the
[44:01.600 --> 44:05.160]  problem solved so they would love for you to think that this is simply about
[44:05.160 --> 44:09.440]  race they don't want people to come together and address these fundamental
[44:09.440 --> 44:13.680]  concerns absolutely outrageous situation and I think something's going to
[44:13.680 --> 44:19.960]  change out there though they're going to have it's a small small city a small
[44:19.960 --> 44:25.480]  town council Idaho but you know what Gary Spence is coming Gary Spence the
[44:25.480 --> 44:32.160]  lawyer who has never lost a criminal trial Gary Spence who defended Randy
[44:32.160 --> 44:37.800]  Weaver he's going to be there he also was involved in the Karen Silkwood case
[44:37.800 --> 44:42.440]  he's had a lot of high-profile cases and you know what he doesn't like it when
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.360]  the government does this kind of thing he's there for the poor for the people
[44:47.360 --> 44:51.200]  who are being treated as slaves by our corporate government and he's going to
[44:51.200 --> 44:54.960]  make these people pay if he gets involved I can tell you that let's take a
[44:54.960 --> 45:03.360]  look at what's going on with the TPP we have this clip from the debate that
[45:03.360 --> 45:06.680]  guys pull that clip up that we have where they're going back and forth
[45:06.680 --> 45:12.600]  talking about the TPP on the debate and of course it was reported by many news
[45:12.600 --> 45:18.440]  outlets that Rand Paul got the best of Donald Trump on this because he pointed
[45:18.440 --> 45:22.920]  out as Donald Trump was discussing the trade situation with the TPP and with
[45:22.920 --> 45:27.680]  China he pointed out well you know the TPP doesn't include China but I think
[45:27.680 --> 45:33.320]  that Rand Paul avoided talking about the issue quite frankly I think it's very
[45:33.320 --> 45:40.320]  important to to talk about the real issue that's going on and of course the
[45:40.320 --> 45:45.840]  real issue is China TPP is being offered to us as a solution to China and
[45:45.840 --> 45:48.880]  that's what I said when we with our live coverage of the debate I thought it was
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.640]  very I thought it was a brilliant strategy by the Trump campaign to put out
[45:53.640 --> 46:00.160]  on the day of the debate his US-China trade reform bill because that is the
[46:00.160 --> 46:05.400]  core problem right there and he went down various aspects of the of the China
[46:05.400 --> 46:09.440]  price as people talk about the violation of property rights of
[46:09.440 --> 46:12.920]  intellectual property rights stealing people's designs and patents and
[46:12.920 --> 46:18.640]  copyrights their movies their car plans making that a precondition to doing
[46:18.640 --> 46:22.960]  business in the country to turn that information over to a Chinese controlled
[46:22.960 --> 46:27.880]  company and of course there's been recent articles about how that affects the
[46:27.880 --> 46:32.760]  military and industrial complex here having to turn over their secrets to
[46:32.760 --> 46:38.080]  the Chinese to companies that were run by former Chinese military so Donald
[46:38.080 --> 46:41.840]  Trump identified the problem I'm not really sure what he's going to do about
[46:41.840 --> 46:44.800]  it you know he says he's a great negotiator so he's going to take care
[46:44.800 --> 46:47.600]  of it but at least he understands what the problem is just like with immigration
[46:47.600 --> 46:50.320]  he understands what the problem is I don't think a wall is a solution I
[46:50.320 --> 46:55.760]  think we've got to stop drawing people in with the free goodies as long as
[46:55.760 --> 47:00.120]  there's a giant vacuum sucking people in promising them free goodies we're not
[47:00.120 --> 47:03.400]  gonna be able to stop them with a wall but at least he understands what the
[47:03.400 --> 47:08.200]  problem in it is and he's willing to talk about that so they were going back
[47:08.200 --> 47:11.840]  and forth they asked about the TPP and this is Trump's answer he says a TPP is
[47:11.840 --> 47:15.240]  a horrible idea it's a deal that's going to lead to nothing but trouble it's a
[47:15.240 --> 47:18.600]  deal that was designed for China to come in as they always do through the
[47:18.600 --> 47:24.320]  back door and that's precisely what Senator Sessions has said he said yeah
[47:24.320 --> 47:28.520]  China is not a part of this deal right now but you understand that this deal
[47:28.520 --> 47:33.000]  was written in secret it's going to be presented on a very short time frame the
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  Congress is not going to have any time to make any amendments to it it'll be a
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.600]  straight up and down vote and once it is in it will be changed on a continuing
[47:42.600 --> 47:46.680]  basis by an international committee that is not accountable to anyone in
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.840]  America no one who has elected they're not it may be counted to accountable to
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.120]  any government they will be able to change all the terms of the agreement
[47:56.120 --> 48:01.320]  at will so it really doesn't even matter what's in these 6,000 pages because
[48:01.320 --> 48:05.280]  they could change it all the very next day the very next day and they could add
[48:05.280 --> 48:10.560]  whatever country they want to the very next day so when you talk about the fact
[48:10.560 --> 48:14.200]  that you know I think Donald Trump gets it he says this is designed for China to
[48:14.200 --> 48:16.680]  come in as they always do through the back door and to take advantage of
[48:16.680 --> 48:20.600]  everyone he says it's 5,600 pages long so complex that nobody's read it it's like
[48:20.600 --> 48:24.360]  Obamacare nobody ever read it they passed it nobody read it now look at the
[48:24.360 --> 48:29.440]  mess we have exactly except this is going to be even worse because this is a
[48:29.440 --> 48:35.400]  deal that once it is finished is going to be changed at will by a trans national
[48:35.400 --> 48:39.560]  committee that's why Jeff Sessions Senator Sessions says when he read this
[48:39.560 --> 48:44.160]  he says you are creating an economic and political union just like the European
[48:44.160 --> 48:49.000]  Union and you have absolutely no representation in this committee that
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.760]  is going to be making the rules that's what they're setting up they're setting
[48:52.760 --> 48:57.040]  up global governance with that with the climate treaties as they tear down our
[48:57.040 --> 49:02.280]  national borders with open immigration and so the new American points out that
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.360]  Trump was correct about the TPP in China and even though Rand Paul came in and
[49:06.360 --> 49:09.080]  said hey Gerard you know we might want to point out that China is not part of this
[49:09.080 --> 49:13.840]  deal everybody laughed the New York Times said that Trump was the butt of a
[49:13.840 --> 49:19.400]  joke but that's not really true I think he had the core issue there all along
[49:19.400 --> 49:25.560]  also some other news in terms of the Federal Reserve we were talking about
[49:25.560 --> 49:31.640]  money earlier and the fact that the Apple CEO says tells college kids your
[49:31.640 --> 49:35.040]  kids will not even know what cash is well they don't really understand what
[49:35.040 --> 49:38.440]  money is now the college students that are there the adults that live in our
[49:38.440 --> 49:42.280]  society don't really understand what money is in November Senator Paul
[49:42.280 --> 49:47.640]  introduced a bring accountability now to the Fed Act one provision of which
[49:47.640 --> 49:51.720]  would forbid the Fed or any of its officials from lobbying you understand
[49:51.720 --> 49:54.600]  that while they're trying to audit the Fed while they're trying to get
[49:54.600 --> 50:00.000]  information about what they do how they do it I mean we know what they do we
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.720]  know that they're manipulating interest rates we know that they're deciding that
[50:03.720 --> 50:06.480]  whether they want to increase the money supply or decrease the money supply I
[50:06.480 --> 50:11.240]  mean that gives them incredible leverage over the economy so we know what
[50:11.240 --> 50:15.560]  they're doing but we would like to get on the inside would like to see what
[50:15.560 --> 50:18.640]  they're the emails for example that they're doing let's take a look at
[50:18.640 --> 50:23.040]  their salaries let's look at what this organization is a bit more closely and
[50:23.040 --> 50:25.920]  expose it to the American people but of course the Fed doesn't want to see that
[50:25.920 --> 50:31.240]  happening so they have hired lobbyists so Rand Paul has pushed back and saying
[50:31.240 --> 50:37.160]  well here's here's a bill that would stop the Fed from doing lobbying he says the
[50:37.160 --> 50:40.280]  Federal Reserve as an entity of the government and operating under authority
[50:40.280 --> 50:43.360]  granted by Congress should not use its funds to lobby the members of Congress
[50:43.360 --> 50:46.080]  well you know what it's not an entity of the government that's the thing that
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.280]  concerns me and Rand Paul should know that there's nothing that is federal
[50:50.280 --> 50:54.120]  about the Federal Reserve is no more federal than federal express they have
[50:54.120 --> 50:58.480]  been given a monopoly we'll talk about that when we come back stay with us a

[52:30.680 --> 52:34.240]  year just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River
[52:34.240 --> 52:39.000]  I loved my dad but boy was he stubborn he hadn't been to the doctor in over 25
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.040]  years his excuse he simply couldn't afford it he wasn't a rich man by any
[52:43.040 --> 52:47.400]  means at less than $107 per month Liberty on call.org would have been the
[52:47.400 --> 52:52.240]  perfect alternative for my father don't wait go to Liberty on call.org right

[52:56.320 --> 53:02.360]  on call.org my name is Bill Bonner and I have an important message right now the
[53:02.360 --> 53:06.040]  highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable
[53:06.040 --> 53:11.240]  crisis but they're about to lose control when this happens it will rip our
[53:11.240 --> 53:16.520]  country apart in ways you never imagined from where we shop to the doctors you
[53:16.520 --> 53:20.520]  visit and the family you want to protect look I've made predictions like this
[53:20.520 --> 53:25.640]  before a few years ago I warned that the housing prices would collapse before
[53:25.640 --> 53:30.280]  that I warned that dot-com companies would crash and they did those who
[53:30.280 --> 53:34.560]  listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do with the
[53:34.560 --> 53:39.880]  stock market this will affect us all I've posted a free video at dollar
[53:39.880 --> 53:45.320]  danger.com maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions but first you need to watch
[53:45.320 --> 53:50.200]  this video and see the facts for yourself you can watch the video for free
[53:50.200 --> 54:11.960]  right now by going to dollardanger.com again that's dollardanger.com
[54:11.960 --> 54:15.480]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight joining us in the next
[54:15.480 --> 54:20.400]  hour will be our Info Wars crews Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson, Leigh Ann McAdoo will
[54:20.400 --> 54:25.560]  be talking about Joe Biggs's report here at the University of Texas where he
[54:25.560 --> 54:30.360]  interviewed and covered the students who are demanding free public college they
[54:30.360 --> 54:34.200]  don't like the fact that it is expensive that they're getting loaded with
[54:34.200 --> 54:37.680]  debt essentially becoming indentured servants for the rest of their lives
[54:37.680 --> 54:41.880]  because most of the degrees that kids get in college nowadays really don't
[54:41.880 --> 54:46.360]  increase their earning potential you want to get a degree in law or medicine or
[54:46.360 --> 54:49.240]  engineering or something yeah that'll help you but you want to get a degree in
[54:49.240 --> 54:53.280]  political science nah not so much you're just gonna have a big debt that you can't
[54:53.280 --> 54:57.720]  get rid of even if you declare bankruptcy but the government wants you to get into
[54:57.720 --> 55:02.000]  debt with that they have created this problem by subsidizing colleges and of
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.320]  course they will offer you the carrot of getting rid of your debt if you will do
[55:05.320 --> 55:09.840]  community service for them or maybe work for the government become a teacher do
[55:09.840 --> 55:14.240]  something else so that's the way that they are putting this out there's a
[55:14.240 --> 55:17.640]  lot of different flavors of this Marco Rubio wants to make this happen for
[55:17.640 --> 55:23.640]  people other socialists besides Rubio people like Bernie Sanders want to do
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.200]  it as well Hillary Clinton as well so we're gonna play that report we're
[55:28.200 --> 55:32.280]  gonna talk to the reporters we're also going to talk about questions about what
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.520]  constitutes real news when we come back we'll have the reporters here in the
[55:37.520 --> 55:41.720]  studio with me I was just talking about the Federal Reserve and about Rand Paul's
[55:41.720 --> 55:48.440]  act to prohibit the Fed from lobbying any of its officials from lobbying and I
[55:48.440 --> 55:52.160]  think that's very important because we have to understand that the Fed is
[55:52.160 --> 55:56.200]  trying to do this is really stepping up the efforts to try to stop anyone from
[55:56.200 --> 56:00.400]  auditing them trying to stop anyone from looking at what they're really doing and
[56:00.400 --> 56:03.360]  of course we've seen what they really do in a hundred years they have reduced the
[56:03.360 --> 56:08.000]  value of our money to where it takes a dollar to buy what a penny would have
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.320]  bought a hundred years ago and that kind of inflation is devastating to
[56:13.320 --> 56:18.920]  savers it's devastating to the economy they are trashing our our money and the
[56:18.920 --> 56:21.320]  only reason we haven't had the kind of high from inflation that you see in
[56:21.320 --> 56:25.120]  socialist countries like Venezuela is because of the petrodollar because we
[56:25.120 --> 56:30.440]  strong armed people into making us a world reserve currency those days are
[56:30.440 --> 56:34.800]  coming to a close and so Rand Paul says the Federal Reserve as an entity of the
[56:34.800 --> 56:38.200]  government and operating under authority granted by Congress should not use its
[56:38.200 --> 56:42.120]  funds to lobby members of Congress or influence Congress's efforts to create a
[56:42.120 --> 56:46.600]  more transparent fundamentally sound monetary policy well you make a more
[56:46.600 --> 56:51.560]  fundamentally sound monetary policy by getting rid of the Fed auditing the Fed
[56:51.560 --> 56:55.720]  is one step in doing that but you got to get rid of the Fed and Rand should know
[56:55.720 --> 57:01.880]  that the Fed can lobby because the Fed is private it is not an entity of the
[57:01.880 --> 57:05.560]  government as he said I'm very surprised to see him say that they can hire
[57:05.560 --> 57:08.720]  lobbyists because they're private organization let's play what Janet
[57:08.720 --> 57:12.840]  Yellen said about negative interest rates and she's questioned by congressman
[57:12.840 --> 57:17.040]  Tom Emmer go a different route I don't think anybody has asked you about this
[57:17.040 --> 57:22.240]  this morning will the Federal Open Market Committee ever rule out going to
[57:22.240 --> 57:32.400]  negative interest rates rule out is something we tend not to do I don't at
[57:32.400 --> 57:41.880]  the moment see a need for negative interest rates the committee is not
[57:41.880 --> 57:47.800]  amazing a domestic economy that's been proceeding on a steady path of
[57:47.800 --> 57:54.640]  improvement our focus has been on the possibility that it will be appropriate
[57:54.640 --> 58:00.040]  to begin okay of course drudge featured her picture at the top of the drudge
[58:00.040 --> 58:03.080]  report with a caption underneath it clueless and what he was linking to in
[58:03.080 --> 58:06.120]  the article was Janet Yellen saying that we only I think we really need to go
[58:06.120 --> 58:10.520]  back and and study the unique things that have been done since 2008 and
[58:10.520 --> 58:15.600]  determine whether or not they worked really really you know Ben Carson was
[58:15.600 --> 58:18.720]  asked whether or not he would keep Janet Yellen I mean we should ask whether
[58:18.720 --> 58:20.720]  night he's gonna keep the Fed but of course he doesn't have a problem with
[58:20.720 --> 58:24.360]  the Fed at all and he doesn't have a problem with Janet Yellen because the
[58:24.360 --> 58:29.760]  two of them have connections going back to Yale see Ben Carson is an insider
[58:29.760 --> 58:35.080]  pretending to be an outsider stay with us we'll be right back with some news

[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:25.080]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.280]  Jones show I'm David Knight in the next segment we're going to have our reporters
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:33.800]  in here talking about students across us marching and demanding free tuition and
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.720]  of course they're going to be demanding it not just for themselves but for
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.360]  anybody who walks across our borders we already see how that is working in this
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.920]  segment I want to cover some news we have a report here that Facebook has
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.640]  announced a surge in government demands for personal user data imagine that
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.640]  of course that's what Facebook and Google really set up for in the first place
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.480]  was turn this information over and this is going to do nothing but accelerate
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.600]  dramatically folks they have now passed CISA the cyber intelligence sharing
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.160]  let's say security I forgot what it is I took the P out which was protection
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.760]  because that was going to protect the the corporations from any liability when
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.880]  they gave private information about you to the government without a search warrant
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.280]  so it was the cyber security information sharing act is what they call it now
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.080]  okay they took the protection out they're going to use this now to say look
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.600]  you don't have any liability people can't sue you for turning the information
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.600]  over to us turn it over now you have no reason to not do this and if you don't
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.400]  do it we're going to maybe make it harder for you to do business they say
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.560]  requests for user data from governmental organizations as well as content
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.240]  restrictions increased globally the first half of 2015 even before CISA passed
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.880]  they say half of the requests came from the United States they point out that US
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:56.800]  law enforcement agencies have been the most demanding US bureaucracies demanded
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:02.760]  data from 26,579 accounts they say there's also a significant amount of
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:08.600]  requests coming from the UK Germany and France Russia totaled one request one
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:13.920]  request isn't that interesting you know we always need to step back and think
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.600]  about the stereotypes that we see in terms of the fact that you know we are
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.240]  struggling we've got to rebuild our military is as Marco Rubio said you know
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.520]  you know as Rand Paul pointed out we spend more than next 10 countries
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:31.880]  combined on our military rebuild it I mean the only reason that it would not
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.040]  be that we laying in ruins which I don't think it is is because we've been
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.040]  fighting seven wars that not declared that we don't need to be involved in
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.240]  under Obama but I don't think it needs to be rebuilt I don't think it's been
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.720]  deconstructed nevertheless we have these stereotypes you know those 10
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.480]  nations of course include China and Russia and then many other nations all
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:58.080]  combined their military budgets are not as much as our military budget and then
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.400]  we also have these stereotypes of East Germany where everybody's being spied
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.600]  on no that would be the United States now or the idea that people get locked up
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.520]  in these gulags are sent to Siberia you know we have more prisoners than any
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.520]  other country far more than any other country because the war on drugs but
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.520]  going back to the fear and paranoia of our government spying on us I say the
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.720]  amount of content restricted for violating local law increased by 112%
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.840]  that's local law enforcement asking about that that went up by 112% so it's a
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:35.200]  big increase by the feds 18% compared to the previous year but that was before
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.440]  they passed CISA you're going to see that explode then they pointed out that
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:45.720]  15,000 content pieces from India and 4,500 in Turkey were requested to be
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:51.800]  taken down to understand that the US the UK these Germany and France they want to
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.840]  spy on you and India and Turkey really want to just kind of censor the
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.280]  information you know what you need to get off of Facebook Julian Assange has
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.400]  warned you about it he says it has all your friends wearing a wire for the
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.600]  government they will take what you say they will twist it they will put it out
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.960]  of context they'll use it to hang you if they decide they want to do that and
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.280]  then this report from WND dropping Facebook actually makes people happier
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.320]  a stunning new study from Denmark shows that social media distorts reality it
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.960]  provides a false perception of what other people are accomplishing in
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:30.880]  their lives and people actually cheer up when they drop their participation they
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.360]  found with a metric they said 7.56 average at the beginning of the study of
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.120]  people said they were happy then they had the happiness rose to an average of
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:45.120]  8.12 after just one week of getting rid of Facebook say with us when we come
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.720]  back we're going to be joined by reporters we're going to talk about the
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.840]  media we're going to talk about the press for socialism yes start with the
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:58.200]  college students demanding a free ride at school we'll be right back
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:04.320]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com Rand Paul calls Obama an idiot on foreign
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.800]  policy what kind of idiot sends four people to war in a campaign stop in
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:13.320]  Iowa yesterday senator Rand Paul had some choice words for the president

[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.320]  Bravo speaking to the crowd on military and foreign policy Paul asks what kind
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:27.960]  of idiot sends four people to war the senator was referring to Obama's
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:33.000]  monumental fail and attempting to train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS the program
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.880]  cost an estimated 500 million dollars but was aborted as it was revealed that
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:44.360]  just four or five trainers remain from an initial 54 if you go to war you don't
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.720]  go with underwhelming force you go to war with overwhelming force Paul further
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.280]  explained Paul also spoke on arming the rebels calling it crazy foolish to feed

[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:26.040]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me in studio or
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:30.320]  Jakari Jackson Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs and we're going to play Joe's
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:35.120]  report they filmed at the University of Texas talking to students who are
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.560]  demanding that they get free college education tell us a little bit about that
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.200]  Joe. Yeah so we were going out to cover this million suit of March by the time
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:47.000]  we got there it already was over we saw some people you know in little groups
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.400]  were like you know let's just go out and do a man on the street talk to some
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.160]  people I'm sure there's gonna be some good stuff out here so sure enough you
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:56.920]  know a lot of people out there they want you to pay for their college they
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.600]  don't want to work hard for it just like my parents did they had part-time jobs
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.360]  they worked the way through college it paid it off you know they did everything
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.920]  they could to support themselves and get that education and now we have these
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.000]  entitled kids who just think that everything should be free that's why
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.880]  Bernie Sanders is so popular and just like hit Daniel said yesterday when we
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.840]  were speaking he's like if everyone has a degree then it's a saturated market
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.720]  now you don't stand out at all how are you gonna stand out between those who
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.240]  don't have a degree and then you having one if everyone has one then they're
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.680]  just gonna have to implement some other kind of program to make you stand out
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.880]  and you're gonna have to pay for that and do that so that's what I understand too
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.800]  that a lot of these degrees aren't really going to increase your income
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.640]  earning potential or your chances of even getting a job in the field that you're
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.480]  liberal yeah there aren't enough jobs for everyone yeah exactly just gonna have a
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.960]  bunch of overly educated people with nothing to do that's right let's run
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:58.480]  that report
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.080]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com and today we are at the University of Texas
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.280]  in Austin yet again today there is a million-man march that happened all
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.280]  over the country where students are asking for free college they want their
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:20.240]  debt removed and they also want all employees to get paid $15 an hour now
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.280]  where I come from if I apply for a loan I have to pay that back that's just kind
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.600]  of how that works here's the thing though this is what the stupid liberal
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:33.400]  politically correct students out there have to understand if your college is
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.440]  free guess what that means someone else has to pay for it so I'm gonna ask
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.720]  people about that ask them if they agree with free college and then if they do
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.440]  ask them to take over my car payment my mortgage payment things like that and
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.240]  see how they react so let's go out here and talk to people and find out what's
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.560]  really going on with this million-man march you think it's good to have free
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:57.160]  college yeah I don't only think free college would be great and in other
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:00.560]  countries they have free college and it works out really well for them that'd
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:06.000]  be awesome if it's possible I don't know but I want to be possible I mean
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  tuition is super expensive as it is and that means somebody's gonna pay for
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  right yeah but I mean if you think about it this way free college tuition
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.720]  wouldn't mean less college debt and there would be a lot more people use
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.520]  utilizing their degrees better so all right so it'd be less student debt for
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.760]  the individual but then at the same time that's still gonna come out of taxes and
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.680]  all that so that means I'm paying for your college he's paying for your college
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.920]  and all that yeah well I mean that's all right I think that's all right you're
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.680]  paying for a lot of stuff right now you're paying for if I were to have a
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.800]  child and send them to public school you'd be paying for his school you know
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.480]  you want to just add but I'm saying you want to keep adding more and more on it
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.000]  that I mean this whole idea that everything can be free my point I'm
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.880]  trying to get across is nothing's free moving towards socialism is that what
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.600]  you're getting to do you like do you agree with that and I agree with that
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.880]  let's go Scandinavian that's what I'm saying so you feel the burn
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:02.520]  burning yeah I feel the Bernie I feel the Bernie for sure so you agree with
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.880]  free school so who do you think is gonna be paying for it then taxes which the
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:13.360]  1% I pay taxes yes yeah yeah everyone thanks to pay for it I think since we
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.920]  have like you know public education until up to high school and it's really
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.080]  like critical to you know get a college degree I think it should be you know
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:28.520]  provided by the government you know and we pay taxes for that also so well our
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:31.640]  education is really suffering compared to like other countries such as Denmark
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.840]  who are gives their students free and they also pay their students to come to
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:40.160]  college they their students are given about $900 a month to go to college so
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.520]  you know it's some stuff's working we're not really number one in education not
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.960]  necessarily sure how I feel about free college I'm very much behind free
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.200]  community college I just I feel like free college is a great idea but it's
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.960]  also probably a bad idea just depending on where that money's coming from and
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.040]  why do you think it's a bad idea well where would that money be coming from
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.280]  I mean I guess we call it sounds nice and a good idea but it's kind of
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.480]  unrealistic so thank you and now why is that I mean free college I guess
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:11.400]  someone's got to pay for that free college exactly that's what we're trying
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.600]  to get through most these people's heads so who do you think that's gonna who's
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.640]  gonna be paying for that I was taxpayers so like me eventually at some point
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:21.760]  whenever I leave my parents so I probably thinking me and be nice to get
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.040]  free college at some point but like it's pretty unrealistic and just cost me more
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.120]  in the long run all right as you can see a lot of people want free college and
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.720]  they really don't care about it they even though the fact that that burden's
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:37.520]  gonna get passed on to someone else they don't care whatsoever it's all about
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.780]  the free stuff everybody seems like they're filling the burn Bernie Sanders
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:46.320]  has taken the term land of the free to a whole another level now we just have to
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.840]  take the brave away and add PCP for politically correct pansies this has
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:14:01.280]  been Joe Biggs with info wars com I want my money back yeah I pay to educate
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.200]  these people from kindergarten through 12th grade yeah and I want my money
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.280]  back for any subsidies that I had to put into their college education because
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.800]  I've never seen a more clueless group of people the best argument for getting out
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.000]  of school and getting into the real world are these people that you just
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.280]  talked to there so programmed and the interesting thing about that because
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.000]  Joe you were talking about this before that report they were actually having a
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.960]  fight for 15 March that's something to raise the minimum wage so here's a guy
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.960]  maybe he wasn't at the March but they had just rallied to have a higher rate
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:37.240]  wage while they say well let's just increase taxes so if they increase taxes
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.520]  your $15 isn't going to be worth anything and that's that's the point you're
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.360]  always bringing up yeah I mean you know why not what's the magic number about
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.560]  15 I mean make it $150 an hour let's all be as wealthy as lawyers okay we're
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.160]  making $1500 an hour we can all be as wealthy as Nancy Pelosi I mean you know
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.920]  the bottom line is you this is just nothing but quantitative easing for the
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.320]  masses yeah it's the same thing they do that the government the Fed not the
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.360]  government but the Fed prints all this money to create a false sense of
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:09.000]  prosperity and of course that money gets funneled into the Wall Street coffers
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.520]  but nevertheless it doesn't help anybody okay it actually makes us worse off and
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.360]  it's not going to help anybody to give this minimum wage out there because it's
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.120]  just going it's going to cause everything to go up it's just going to
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:23.800]  release a new wave of inflation it's going to cause some people to get because
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:27.080]  of TV you got like the Kardashian show they're all rich they got stuff everyone
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.560]  sees that they want it every commercials like a brand new commercial for a new
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:34.640]  diamond ring a new Mercedes something like that and everyone's like well I make
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.720]  $7 an hour if I make $15 an hour I could buy these things that I really need
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:40.440]  that'll make me happy and they're never going to get that and it's just
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.120]  programmed so people are not living within their means because you go these
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.520]  campuses you see guys walking around with Jordans and beats which are
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.560]  basically Jordans for your head you're not living within your your responsibility
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.480]  well nobody likes to work for anything anymore though it's an entitlement
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.120]  society where everything just comes to you so quickly and easily and so nobody
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:04.960]  wants to do the work that takes to get well it is it is harder if they wanted
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.720]  to get a job it would be harder for them to get a job because we've got so many
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.800]  people coming in adults who want a career at McDonald's because that is a step
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.720]  up and standard of living from the country that they came from and they
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.560]  need to ask themselves why is college so expensive as I pointed out early in the
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.280]  program I was able to go to college my wife went to college I went to a state
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.200]  school so the tuition was less than the what I spent on books okay and you could
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:32.360]  support yourself with a part-time job my wife went to a private school tuition
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:35.800]  was a lot more expensive she wound up with a small loan but it was manageable
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.320]  okay we didn't become slaves for our entire life like these kids are so they
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.920]  have to ask themselves why is this so expensive and it's because it's been
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:47.960]  subsidized by the government okay that's that that subsidy just like you see
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.560]  with insurance rates okay you compare what happens when somebody goes to the
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:55.520]  hospital and they have insurance versus and this is the LA Times did this it's
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.640]  not a conservative paper doing this they said to look at what happens somebody
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.480]  goes to get health care they don't have any insurance or a cash patient they
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:08.120]  paid less overall than the people with insurance paid even with their you know
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.320]  paid for their deductible so their deductible was more than the cash
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.680]  patient paid total right okay and that's what you're getting at these social it
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.880]  you know these people being educated socialism they love Bernie Sanders did
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.240]  you point out they're not even really educated because we have this clip the
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.840]  guys are queuing up from Fox News as a young lady named Healy I guess she was
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.240]  in charge of the million and basically the commentator asked her well who's
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.720]  gonna pay for this stuff if you were the one percent's gonna pay for it he said
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.080]  well if you tax the one percent they're gonna move out of the country then who's
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.920]  gonna pay for it well somebody's always gonna have money there's always gonna be
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:44.520]  a one percent that you said eventually you run out of other people's money
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.560]  that's a problem with socialism yeah so let's go ahead and take a look at this
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.480]  clip okay yeah we're gonna have that in a moment well you know when we talk
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.640]  about that I think and Bernie Sanders is a part of what is is feeding this
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.880]  because he's really pushing socialism hardcore the thing about Bernie Sanders
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.440]  is that he has he comes across as authentic as genuine to people and so
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:11.400]  that sells and I think you could see that in Ron Paul when he ran last time
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.040]  people knew that he would he would be consistent in what he believed okay so he
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.680]  had a large following college students and they're not really looking at
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.760]  libertarianism versus socialism when you go back and you look I call him Bernie
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:27.840]  Sandernista because of his praise for the Sandernistas and for Daniel Ortega
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.720]  down in Nicaragua look at what happened with that I mean that was a classic case
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.480]  of crony capitalism he was thrown out by coalition of conservatives and
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.040]  communists okay he had confiscated people's property confiscated the
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.320]  property of corporations and then before he left office he privatized it again
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.400]  into his own personal account and look at the basket case that Hugo Chavez is
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:54.320]  Venezuela and Nicaragua and you know Venezuela they pay the bankers 700%
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.160]  return on their investment Bloomberg was bragging about that saying you know
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.480]  people are having to go to other countries to get food and water and
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.920]  medicine but they know that they got to pay the bankers first and we're getting
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.400]  700% return on investment so it's still a great deal that's what Bernie Sanders
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.320]  says he's against is this kind of crony capitalism this Wall Street raping of
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.760]  the people and yet that's precisely where it happens the worst is in the
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:19.360]  countries that he holds up as examples they have the worst crony capitalism the
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.320]  worst kleptocracies going on in these countries right and everyone's always
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.800]  trying to say oh Scandinavia Denmark and all of these other places but that's
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:31.000]  not reality and you know I don't think a lot of bad news comes out of those
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.160]  places because they're you know well they're not they're getting poor very
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.440]  rapidly now with the open borders that's why you take those countries down
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.800]  because they started out at a much higher level than the Central American
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.000]  countries and it's going to take a longer time to take them down unless and
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.520]  because they are now bringing in the voting and voting the welfare we'll be

[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me in the studio
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.840]  or Jakari Jackson Leanne McAdoo Joe Biggs sir we've been talking about the
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:26.160]  massive marches across the country yesterday pushing the idea that kids
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.000]  today ought to get a free college education of course as you pointed out
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.640]  earlier we're all out of college we're going to be pay for our college
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:42.240]  degrees if we got money else's yeah you know what's what's fair about that but
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.640]  here's the bigger issue of course we know that illegal aliens can come into
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:51.160]  the country they can get out of they can get in-state tuition even better than
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.320]  American students okay and the whole idea behind that is that you pay taxes all
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:01.520]  your life to partially support this this university but we cannot afford to
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.920]  provide a free college education to everybody on the planet and that's what's
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.440]  going to wind up happening with this anybody who can get their feet into the
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.040]  country will be able to get a free college education but let's play that
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:16.000]  report that you were talking about Jakari they actually asked one of the
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.280]  organizers is that correct yes one of the organizers of the million student
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.240]  March I went on Fox News and you know the guy asked her basic questions of who's
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:27.440]  gonna pay for this and she has some rather interesting non-annual yeah let's
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:34.760]  run that clip what do you want what do you want well so the movement the
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:40.000]  million student March is a movement for a more equitable and fair system of
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.960]  education as opposed to the really corporate model that we have right now
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:49.000]  so the three core demands of the National Day of Action are free public
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.720]  college a cancellation of student debt and a $15 an hour minimum wage for
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:57.960]  people who work on the campus and how's that going to be paid
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.120]  great question I mean you know so whatever I'm not sure if you're talking
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.800]  on like a national level or at particular schools I can sort of touch on
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:15.040]  both if you wanted someone asked to pick up the tab who would that be the one
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:19.200]  percent of people in society that are hoarding the wealth and really sort of
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.080]  causing a catastrophe that students are facing I mean we have a relationship
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.560]  right now where one percent of the population owns more wealth than the
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:36.440]  99 percent combined just had their taxes raised a few years ago back to
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.000]  almost 40 percent then to pay for the health care while they had them raised
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.280]  another few percentage points then they had their deductions limited to raise
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:48.920]  another couple points where depending on the state of locality they're pushing
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:56.040]  over about what 50 percent of taxes you know we all need to remember Steve
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.880]  Jobs Bill Gates I didn't go to college you know Bill Gates had a lot of help
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.200]  from his millionaire dad but you know the bottom line is Steve Jobs a lot of
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:07.920]  entrepreneurs didn't go to college and I love how they start this off she's
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:13.520]  like our demands yeah we want free college tuition we want loans for giving
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.040]  and all this stuff and I'm not a fan of corporate welfare because that's
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.440]  often times the the counterpoint it's like well instead of giving corporations
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:24.040]  welfare give it to us I don't want anybody to get it you know I didn't get to
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.800]  go to UT I didn't go to the big school with a big football team and you know
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.960]  celebrities drop by every week I didn't get that I want to a freaking community
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.520]  college you know it's small universities you know in Backwoods, Kansas and
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.240]  Oklahoma and now I don't have you know $80,000 in student loan debt that's how
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:43.360]  you do it if you choose to be 18 years old and go and buy you know a education
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.120]  which is the same price of a BMW then you're just gonna be in debt well you
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.440]  know if this young lady is an example she's the leader of this movement and
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:53.600]  if she's representative of the people who are getting college degrees I would
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.200]  say in the near future a college degree is going to be counter indicator of
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:03.680]  whether or not you should be hired I'm very proud of the fact I'm a high
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.960]  school dropout like I'm very proud of it you know they couldn't couldn't hold me
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:13.560]  down and I was a private Christian school then I homeschooled I mean I learned
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:17.000]  more in homeschool hanging around you know my mom coming in teaching me stuff
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.360]  tonight whatever yeah like basic stuff just like Joe was mentioning earlier if
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.200]  everybody has it it doesn't mean anything if everybody can fly and
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.080]  everybody's bulletproof there is no Superman that's right so basically you
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:31.960]  have a college degree just to get a just to work at a reception desk but you
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.440]  know what will happen is they will fold this in as a federal thing and what
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:39.040]  they'll do is they'll just paper it they'll just start printing paper nobody
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.360]  will pay any attention to the cost we already paid for all right anyways yeah
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.360]  it'll accelerate the collapse of the country it is the sort of the pressure
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.880]  from above and below and so now you're creating this class of people that is
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.160]  demanding this welfare demanding this socialism and it's gonna look like the
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.640]  hunger games our society will look like the what's gonna happen and there's
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:01.680]  already moves that are happening to change the United States so that the
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.840]  American dollar from being the reserve currency to get rid of the Petro dollar
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:08.080]  China very much wants to get rid of it we're making enemies of Russia the Cold
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:10.880]  War we're starting up again so they want to get us out of that because that's a
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:14.960]  source of our power to create this massive military to do all these things
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:19.120]  for which we never have any economic accountability and when that plug is
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.240]  pulled and we and and people point out that we've been walking on air we're
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:26.200]  gonna sink like a cartoon character you know we're gonna look down at some point
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.840]  we'll go oh there's nothing underneath me right this has been a fantasy of my
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:33.720]  imagination and that's it and that's what's gonna happen look when we come

[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:24.400]  Biggs we're going to talk about this back and forth between George Will and
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:29.000]  Bill O'Reilly over Bill O'Reilly's recent book the one that's at the top of
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.680]  the nonfiction charts killing Reagan I think it brings up so it's very
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:37.000]  entertaining to watch it actually but it also brings up some very interesting
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.360]  points about how we do journalism how do we determine what's true and what isn't
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:46.640]  and of course it was also an article earlier this week about daily newspapers
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:51.200]  down 80% hard news is in danger of disappearing they say it's in same kind
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.360]  of extinction it's facing as newspapers and magazines so they're very concerned
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:58.680]  that people are not interested in watching quote-unquote hard news we'll
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:04.120]  talk about what is hard news as opposed to what they term opinion journalism it's
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:07.920]  a very important discussion to have that shows up in things like the back and
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.800]  forth that we saw about Ben Carson for the vettings that they did have been
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:16.200]  Carson was that over the top or was that fair games and we can talk about that
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:18.840]  sort of thing as well before we do before we go to our panelists before we play
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.880]  this clip with comments about what happened with killing Reagan I want to

[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.600]  it's in stock let's play this attack let me set this up a little bit for people
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:35.080]  who don't know of course Bill O'Reilly wrote a book called killing Reagan the
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:39.480]  central premise of the book was that the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:47.120]  about 70 days into his presidency left him mentally impaired with an early
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:52.280]  onset of Hall's Heimers now George will took immense exception of that and wrote
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:58.720]  an editorial on the Washington Post saying that look conservatism essentially
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.640]  hangs on whether or not Reagan was a great guy or not he wants to see
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.640]  hagiographies and nothing but hagiographies for Ronald Reagan we got
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:11.360]  to make a saint out of him and he believes that conservatism hangs on
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.560]  whether or not Ronald Reagan is a perfect guy I mean that's basically it
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.000]  folks and so he wrote a nevertheless he had some good points he made some really
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.760]  strong points about sloppy research about not checking and vetting sources in
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:31.960]  his book and that was what really got under Bill O'Reilly's skin he pointed
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:38.040]  out that Bill O'Reilly had not checked any sources he had not they listed as a
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:41.280]  reference and he didn't have a lot of references in his book for what he was
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.520]  talking about they listed as one of the references the Reagan library and he and
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.840]  you have to sign in to get materials of the Reagan library and he was able to
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:51.920]  check that Bill O'Reilly nor his assistants went there to get any
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:58.240]  information so Bill O'Reilly that same day of such a glaring attack on him he
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.960]  said that George Wells said that Bill O'Reilly had done more damage to Ronald
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.320]  Reagan and to conservatism because you know conservatism equals Ronald Reagan
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:12.000]  in their minds he had done more damage than a conscientious historian could have
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.960]  done who was opposed to Ronald Reagan I mean it was just that kind of you know
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:18.800]  stick the knife in and twist it you know you did more damage than a real
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.400]  historian could have done so Bill O'Reilly has him on the program and I
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:27.320]  want you to see this and we'll comment on this let's roll back clip the memo was
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.120]  presented to Howard Baker Howard Baker took one look at it and said to the man
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.200]  who wrote it this is not the Ronald Reagan I know and that was the end that
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.800]  was not the influence the not telling the truth you are actually misleading the
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:47.120]  American people you are something of an expert on actively misleading the
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.440]  American people and then George well returns to says to Bill O'Reilly you
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:55.160]  were something of an expert on this leading he's learning from the best
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:01.400]  right these guys both work for a fox stop there yeah well they began the
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:06.160]  interview and he comes after George will for not going to and we're gonna talk
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.400]  about hard news you didn't go to the editor of hard news like you were told
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.040]  to do you were supposed to show this to him before you went public with this
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:19.280]  did once you told us and they go back and forth and he was he was not
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.160]  defending his book he was attacking him for not getting an approved from Fox
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.640]  because they both work for Fox let's continue on with that clip eating the
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:33.680]  American people you are lying and here's more proof Edmund Morris you know
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:39.720]  who he is you know who Edmund Morris is go ahead okay okay here it is Edwin
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:44.840]  Morris quote during one unhappy period when the Iran-Contra scandal coincided
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:48.520]  with prostate problems for mr. Reagan the president was so withdrawn and
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:52.920]  confused that papers were surreptitiously drawn up by staffers concerned he
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.800]  might have to be declared disoriented okay now that is from the guy who wrote
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:03.000]  the bio you want LA Times you want New York Times quotes on it I got them I
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.080]  could read them to you you who began this interview by saying I had a moral
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.200]  obligation to call you by for writing about your book wrote a book without
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:16.520]  feeling any obligation to talk to Ed Meese George Schultz Jim Baker hold it
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:20.760]  right there hold it right there so he says you began the interview by saying I
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:23.480]  should talk to you first before I went out of this because you wrote a book
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:27.120]  about Reagan without talking to anybody yeah close to that right yeah it's a
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:31.640]  great guy let's continue on with this Baker any of the other people who could
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:36.680]  and why did I not talk to them because they would have refuted the no because
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:41.000]  they have skin in the game we don't talk to people when we're writing our books
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.320]  I mean they know they have knowledge of they have skin in the game emotion in the
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.400]  game guys hold it right here now I thought it was interesting when I saw
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.040]  this because George will miss that opportunity he didn't come back and say
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.680]  well then why would I talk to you because you've got skin in the game yeah I
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.840]  mean why would I talk to you about your own book you're not gonna get on this and
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:02.360]  so Bill O'Reilly goes on with the the idea that we don't talk to people who
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:06.560]  are laudatory sources or whatever and so that that brings up the whole issue as
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.360]  to you know who do you talk to what is hard news but let's finish up with this
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:15.000]  because they kicker here the way this ends is really pretty amazing I mean
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.880]  Bill O'Reilly really loses it with George well let's play this we don't talk
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:25.200]  to anybody who was derogatory to the Reagan's or anybody who is laudatory we
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:30.000]  do our own investigation you want me to read more I got more this meeting
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.560]  absolutely took place on page 245 it was absolutely taken seriously by Mr. Baker
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:40.520]  and everybody else and the conclusion of the meeting was the president was fine
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:46.120]  he was capable and killing Reagan is a laudatory book toward Ronald Reagan and
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:51.440]  you didn't even mention that it is not a laudatory book it is a laudatory book or
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:56.240]  you can't read it is doing the work of the left which knows that in order to
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:01.040]  discredit conservatism it must destroy Reagan's reputation as a president and
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.480]  your book does the work of the American left with its extreme recklessness and
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:10.200]  when you find out around after the book's publication to schedule in an
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:14.360]  interview with Ed Meese you then canceled it saying you were canceled because Ed
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:21.480]  Meese wanted to come on with conditions so I do not understand how you've got a
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:27.080]  memo you've never seen look here's the deal that memo was written that meeting
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:31.480]  took place all of what we write in killing Reagan is true you're a hack
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:36.360]  you're in with the cabal of the Reagan loyalists who don't want the truth to be
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:43.080]  told killing Reagan is a laudatory book it praises Ronald Reagan yet you didn't
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:51.480]  call me when you said you would because they wanted a deification they wanted a
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.920]  deification they try to get the book killed before it was even published and
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:02.280]  you let us play right into the line that isn't a lie and we can prove it and you
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:10.520]  are so he's like I want the left now you guys can correct me if I'm wrong and
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:15.600]  didn't O'Reilly say he visited some witness of the JFK assassination when
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.680]  he was working in Dallas and then they proved that he never went there's like
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:21.840]  some guy who lived in Florida I don't remember I don't remember but I thought
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:26.280]  it was interesting saying that you know well you know conservatism rises or
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:29.760]  falls on Ronald Reagan and it was like well if that's the case it's gonna fall
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.800]  because you you know people are fallible okay and Ronald Reagan had a lot of
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:39.040]  issues I think the real core with all this is the people who around the time
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:43.680]  you we looked at Ronald Reagan and it was like wow you know what happened to
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:46.840]  him you know and there's been people said well you know was he did he have an
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.360]  early onset of Alzheimer's did they get to him did they threaten him did he sell
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:55.680]  out was he a phony from the very beginning you know I mean because
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:59.160]  everything that he said he was going to do and that's a lesson for people he
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:01.440]  said he was gonna get rid of the Department of Education he's gonna
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.160]  balance the budget and so he had a long list of promises all of which he
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:08.920]  basically just threw under the table you know when he got in there and we saw
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:14.200]  things like Iran-Contra okay I mean that's a big deal okay and subsequently
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:20.880]  we have seen people allege and that he was that they were in negotiation with
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.920]  the Iranian government telling them do not release the hostages to Jimmy Carter
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:28.360]  hold them until after the election if you do that we will make a deal with you
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:33.240]  okay which is what they did they sold that supposedly our worst enemy okay the
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:36.640]  center of terrorism that everybody was told they were selling them spare parts
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:40.600]  because of course they had a whole bunch of American fighter planes there that
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:44.360]  they'd given to the Shaw so they were selling them spare parts and then using
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:50.680]  that to conduct guerrilla warfare in violation of the law in violation of
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.840]  the Constitution okay so you got to hold their feet to the fire it's like this
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:44:00.360]  documentary saw a killing Ed where he's talking to Dan Patrick here in Texas
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:06.200]  who likes charter schools for whatever reason I mean I want to have a choice as
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.480]  a parent but if you can't pull back and say yeah you know what I've seen some
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.160]  abuses with charter schools like these ghoulin schools so maybe we need to fix
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.400]  them because they're not perfect but if but what Dan Patrick does is he doubles
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.320]  down he won't admit that's a problem with these ghoulin schools and so you know
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:25.560]  he discredits the whole thing that's what really discredits conservatism is
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:29.800]  when you won't admit where it failed yeah I agree that 100% and I'm not
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:34.360]  defending O'Reilly here at all but for you know somebody as O'Reilly put it to
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:38.520]  deify these people that's the issue that led us to the part where we are in this
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:42.120]  country today because you can't criticize Obama you can't criticize Reagan
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.640]  can't criticize Bush it everybody has their super heroes in politics that you
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:50.520]  cannot dare say that the emperor has no clothes and that's pretty much at what
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:55.600]  has led us to this situation in American history yeah yeah absolutely so we come
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.400]  to this report here and this says media graveyard as we've read the headlines
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:03.360]  many times and they say that we're going to lose quote-unquote hard news it's
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:06.280]  going to go the way of the newspaper in the magazine and we're going to have a
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:11.880]  rise of a type of opinion journalism that was popular two or three centuries
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.200]  ago well I would say that you know maybe that's not a bad thing because two or
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.120]  three centuries ago we had the people who were educated enough in this country
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:22.760]  to lay down the principles that we have foolishly abandoned okay that would
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:27.320]  make this country work but I guess when I look at this I think that what's dying
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:30.800]  is really this myth of objective journalism right yeah I mean you can
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:36.280]  see how biased the media actually is just with the the debate coverage and the
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:40.680]  questions that are asked at each debate I mean well what they talk about opinion
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:44.640]  journalism I mean opinion journalism is going to be absolutely worthless if you
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.680]  can't back it up with facts right but when we talk about quote-unquote objective
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.600]  journalism okay that is quote-unquote hard news right what they're saying here
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.000]  is that they don't have a point of view that's coming through in their news of
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.960]  course they do what the stories that you choose to pick yes your point of view
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:05.880]  look at the drudge report for example he's an editor okay he's America's editor
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:11.160]  he decides what is interesting to him okay and that's the same process that
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:14.480]  happens in all the newspapers at the Washington Post the New York Times the
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:19.320]  L.A. Times all these people who are supposedly totally objective and unbiased
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:23.920]  their biases show up in the articles that they choose to report follow where
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:27.520]  the money's coming right or the sources that they get in touch with and it's
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:32.880]  always administration officials say you know exactly news is far white house
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:37.280]  say like oh okay box news is far from fair and balanced oh yeah and anyway
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.880]  absolutely and CNN should just come out and say you know what we're here for the
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:43.800]  Democrats completely and totally right you know MSNBC hey we're liberal as
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:46.440]  well that's what we're doing you know but that's the thing though anytime I
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.840]  go and talk to people hey what what do you guys watch for news what do you look
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:52.920]  to like we don't really trust going to any kind of news source because they
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:56.400]  always lie and say that they're either fair and balanced or they're there to
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:01.840]  give a you know honest opinion an honest opinion on every subject when in fact
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:05.360]  they know that's not gonna happen when you actually sit there and then I always
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.920]  kind of knew that but I really didn't get to see it until we were going to
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:11.140]  Ferguson all the time and you see how these guys on the ground they're
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:15.600]  reporting what I just saw I know I just saw what I saw yes they distorted it
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.280]  within two seconds saying that no smoke was fired no tell you say that the
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.560]  police wasn't shot even they were they were out there with us I hacking and
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:28.160]  gagging and people wonder why there's a media graveyard why they don't trust
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:33.040]  hard news or anyone well I thought of the bunny ranch I saw what Bill Glenn Beck
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:36.240]  did okay and turns to the way that he twisted what had happened out there the
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.760]  way he spun that so yeah we've seen that and what they're saying in this is that
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:43.240]  the internet makes it possible for everybody to express their opinion
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:47.120]  widely well it also gives us a chance to get firsthand reports yes and that's
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:50.840]  why that is is valuable you know in many cases just like we had with this
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:55.680]  shooting that's going on that happened in Idaho where the rancher went out to
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:59.640]  put down the bowl and we got one official story but now other stories are
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.560]  coming out there and now we see the government is pushing back they're
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:05.560]  they're clamping down they won't let they won't even release the names of the
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:09.480]  deputies they say well we don't know whether or not there's any footage
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:12.960]  captured by their body cameras or by the cars or anything when they pull back
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.600]  and they try to shut stuff down like that that's why people are using the
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:20.640]  internet to find that information yeah all kinds of things on lively right
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.800]  YouTube to be edited you know happening at the moment on Twitter but you can
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:29.480]  also see just the way that they're covering all these protests that are
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.760]  going on across the country with Black Lives Matter and everything I was
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:37.880]  watching I think CNN the other day and they were allowing the students to tell
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:42.880]  their demands right there on primetime news gave them like five minutes to
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:47.400]  just speak to just talk you know talk about fair and balanced and then that
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:52.480]  ties into this article coming out of Politico major donors consider funding
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:57.720]  Black Lives Matter and so these are major Democratic donors billionaires
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:01.920]  millionaires who are talking about funding this Black Lives Matter movement
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:05.560]  so what do they get out of that meeting and secret right meeting and secret and
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:08.440]  so what does that mean when you're funding this movement now now do they
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:14.360]  need to go and protest at the areas you know that you instruct them to but but
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:17.960]  these millionaires and billionaires are meeting in secret and their whole
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:23.040]  purpose is for a permanent realignment of American politics yeah and these the
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.080]  you know these this whole movement started on Twitter and things like that
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:34.400]  in the moment people being there and then it's quickly got co-opted and now
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:39.020]  it's there is an agenda a clear agenda so on the internet people are able to
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:41.800]  freely express opinions and one of the things that they say in this article
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.320]  and say well that's led to people being confused you know because they don't
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:51.040]  have neutral intermediaries like reporters fact-checkers editors readers
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.440]  now they have they don't really know if what they're getting is true and it's
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:57.400]  like yeah you have to think yeah okay you have to think that's one of the
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.520]  reasons why we had a vibrant political discussion 200 years ago because people
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:04.880]  had to think they were given people would be up front about it I would prefer
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:07.760]  somebody is to tell me that they're fair and balanced and I know that they're
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:11.440]  either lying to me or they're incredibly naive if they think that okay they
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.160]  don't understand or recognize their own biases I would rather than say look I'm
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:20.280]  a conservative journal I'm a liberal journal I'm a libertarian or a socialist
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:24.600]  journal whatever that be up front about it and say here are the facts that I found
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:28.160]  and here's how analyze it they say we're in a golden age of opinion journalism
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:33.040]  there's greater analysis a sort of more interesting analytical gray zone I don't
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:37.120]  see that as a gray zone I see that as a plus you know we're gonna analyze these
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:41.080]  facts from multiple perspectives and try to figure out what's really true and
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.160]  just like you said I'd prefer that they just come out and say this is my
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.640]  position and this is how I got to this way of thinking as opposed to trying to
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:53.320]  convince you that they're neutral just like exactly that's exactly what we're
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.880]  missing in the presidential debates there is no debate we'll be right back

[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:25.640]  news crew jacari jackson leon macadoo and joe big we've been talking about
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:30.520]  is hard news disappearing and if you define hard news as this
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:35.080]  faux objectivity I think it's a good thing I think people need to understand
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:39.720]  that everyone has biases and we're up front about the fact that we're biased
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.200]  for liberty we're biased for freedom we look at things we analyze it from that
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.640]  standpoint and we show the facts that we've
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:52.280]  got and we try to put those together into an analysis that's what we do here
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:55.240]  they call that opinion journalism and they're wringing their hands saying
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:58.120]  that's that's getting more and more popular and
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:01.480]  so-called hard news is disappearing well I don't think that's a problem quite
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:04.360]  frankly I want to go back and and talk to them about how
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:08.120]  they view this this vetting I would say the vetting have been
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.960]  Carson has it been fair or has it been unfair before I do real quickly I want
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:15.640]  to let you know about a new special we have as well as a new product we got

[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:55.640]  other products that are now in stock like survival shield x2 nascent iodine
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:59.000]  you need to have that stocked up as we're coming into the
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.840]  winter here let's go to Ben Carson and of course he believes that he was
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:10.360]  very unfairly treated as people were vetting him for
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:14.120]  uh claims that were made in his book i looked at this
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:17.320]  and to me i i believe that they were looking at him
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:21.160]  very closely and we can talk about whether or not you agree with the what
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:24.440]  people said about that but nevertheless the liberal press and they
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:27.560]  understand that there is no objective press right so the liberal press is
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:30.680]  looking at him very carefully the conservative press looked at obama very
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:33.240]  carefully and the thing that i thought was a
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:36.280]  problem was not that they were being vetted carefully by people who don't
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:39.080]  share their opinions and don't support them
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:42.440]  but i see it as a bigger problem that the people who do
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:45.800]  support them are supporting them personally and they don't
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:49.160]  want to hear anything bad about it which takes us back to where we started
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:52.600]  with george will about ronald reagan oh yes just like you said
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:55.640]  whether it's uh republicans democrats whether it's
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:58.600]  hillary or trump you know they're looking very hard into
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:02.280]  anybody who's running yeah so just say that they're singling out one guy i think
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.280]  is not really accurate but i think it's also
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:09.640]  very concerning because this is what i was concerned about donald
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:12.280]  trump at the beginning when he had absolutely no position papers and now
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:14.440]  he's put out four or five position papers
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:17.800]  i agree with some of a good deal what he's put out with these
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:21.400]  position papers i appreciate the fact they're very detailed but you know when
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:25.640]  he was first running he was out there just you know as a personality vote for
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:29.800]  a celebrity exactly i'm a celebrity i'm successful vote for
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:33.000]  me and and that kind of identity politics you know we see that from carlie
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.640]  if you're mean i'm a woman vote for me okay i really hate that i really hate
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:40.920]  the fact that people are so invested in a person
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:44.520]  that they won't look at their background or look at their issues
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:48.040]  you know and of course with ben carson he's running on his personal integrity
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:51.880]  saying that he is an outsider and i'm a person of integrity so it's a valid
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:55.560]  thing to go in and vet the stories that he's put in
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:58.920]  print they had these things written in his autobiography i think and it scares
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:01.880]  me when i see the the public saying we don't want to hear that
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:04.120]  that's not fair you shouldn't talk about that you shouldn't look at that i've
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:07.560]  been critical of almost every candidate out there in some kind of way
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.880]  yeah and it's funny like i'll get on facebook and i'll be like you know i
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:13.560]  don't like this about trump and if you like oh my god why did you say that
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:17.720]  about him like you like hillary then yeah yeah are you a clean supporter then
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:21.000]  you're a democrat i knew it you know what i'm like
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.200]  well he's not perfect he's got some things wrong with him i'm just bringing
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:26.360]  that out so you guys can be a little bit more informed

[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:41.080]  and what they thought about came out of it we'll be right back

[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:27.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and jacari jackson leon
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:31.800]  macadoo and joe bigs are here with me we've been talking about what's fair
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:35.880]  game for the media i mean should we be allowed to criticize ronald
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:40.520]  reagan george will was really really angry at bill o'reilly
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:46.120]  thinks that he has done irreparable harm to conservatism because
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:49.880]  ronald reagan was criticized but he does have some valid criticisms about the
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:52.600]  sloppy research that bill o'reilly did but
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:55.720]  we've seen the same same thing playing out with ben carson
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:01.160]  people vetting the stories about his his personal testimony about how he
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:04.920]  had an incredibly dangerous temper but then that changed
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:08.600]  as he was converted as a christian or whatever but we've also seen
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.800]  the case of whether or not is it is it true that
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.400]  general westmoreland the highest ranking military official at the time came to
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:18.440]  his high school and begged him to come to west point essentially and he said
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:21.800]  well gee thanks general but i'd rather not so i thought this is very
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:24.600]  interesting i want to get your your take on this
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.920]  this is 17 second clip here this is sean hannity gets him on his radio
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:34.040]  program and asks and summarizes this uh westmoreland claim
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:38.120]  and he says is this true or not ask him point blank i want you to hear ben
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:41.800]  carson's answer in your book gifted hands that
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:45.960]  you were 17 years old then you were introduced in 1969
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:49.160]  to general william westmoreland who had just ended his command with the u.s
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:52.760]  forces in vietnam and that you dined together
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:56.840]  is that true it may well have been but what
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:00.920]  what i okay it may well have been it may well have been
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:04.920]  i mean i cannot confirm or deny whether this actually happened
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:08.360]  already sounded like a politician but can you believe that and of course
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:11.400]  sean hannity doesn't skip a beat he just keeps on going
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:14.600]  and building up ben carson you know and everything it's like
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:19.160]  you you you give him the the case there and say did that happen he goes well it
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:21.720]  may well have been and then he goes on to say well you know it's been about 40
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:25.880]  years i can't really remember but somebody put that in the book yeah
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:29.400]  and he's been selling that he's done a book he's done a movie about his life
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:33.640]  and all these details and i think it's really sad that we're talking
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:37.560]  about what he did in high school but he is the one that felt that he needed to
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:40.920]  boast about that and i think it's fair game to look at this and there was
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:45.400]  another story that was even more unbelievable than
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:49.000]  than the westmoreland story but still the facts that he presented that
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.960]  this happened around memorial day i think and and the
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:55.000]  the travel arrangement showed that westmoreland wasn't uh in
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.360]  detroit area and that sort of thing but that's a very valid point that you
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:01.000]  bring up just like when we talk about hillary and she's like i stepped off a
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.400]  helicopter and people were shooting at me right you know
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:06.520]  people go back and check them they see that it never happens yet even stop to
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:10.840]  sign autographs like we're on fire i understand why integrity is important
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:14.200]  i mean we can look at the position papers that that people put out i mean i
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:17.320]  like a lot of the position papers that trump put out but then the question is
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:20.520]  do i believe he has the character to follow through on this because i mean
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:23.720]  look at what we've seen with john bainer like what we've seen mitch McConnell
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:27.960]  all the leadership okay eric canter who has voted out and now we've got paul
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:31.960]  ryanow in there i mean this is we have been betrayed over and over again i mean
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:35.080]  the best we can do is say okay this is what they say they're going to do he's
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:37.960]  the only candidate who's saying he's going to do x and that's my important
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:41.960]  issue so i'm going to send a message i had lunch with one of the uh guys on uh
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:45.320]  trump's legal team like a month ago sat down and had lunch with him out on
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:48.760]  rainy street or whatever and he said this is a guy that when he says he's going to
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.520]  do something he does it and then we had uh the the guests in here the other day
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:55.400]  said the same thing and that's what you're getting a lot from the people that
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:58.520]  know trump personally that's the kind of guy he is but you're not really getting
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:02.360]  that from other candidates as well you have to understand integrity is an
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:06.360]  issue so it is an issue whether or not we can trust ben carson if he is
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:09.320]  padding his resume you know and of course we have to take other people's word for
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.520]  it but that is a that is something has to be vetted well but once you get in
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:16.200]  there though you might have really good intentions but there are so many other
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:20.040]  things operating behind the scenes that you know they might say listen you're
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:23.640]  not going to get anything done so you might as well take this big chunk of
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:28.440]  money and get this done and so you know again that goes back to ronald reagan
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:31.960]  whether or not he was uh mentally impaired and did get this done or whether
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:35.800]  or not he just decided he was going to compromise i am of the opinion that the
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:39.000]  fix was in from the very beginning he was willing to compromise on principles
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.800]  and put george hw bushin as his vice president so he could win the nomination
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.000]  even though he had called everything he wanted to do voodoo economics and that
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.080]  sort of thing i mean i saw the compromise before the election i think a lot of
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:53.960]  people did yeah well thanks for joining us when we come back we're going to be
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:58.520]  talking to anthony gucciardi we'll be right back

[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:21.000]  host today and joining me now is anthony gucciardi at the bottom of the hour
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.720]  we're gonna have a special report from alex jones on how to defeat the new
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:28.360]  world order in this report alex breaks down the fact we reached a cultural
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:32.520]  tipping point not just here in the united states but worldwide
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:36.200]  and we're going to talk exactly about what the prime minister
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:41.320]  of hungary is saying about this he sees this in exactly the same way that we do
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:45.080]  hungarian leader says immigration is a treasonous conspiracy
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:48.600]  to marginalize nation states this is from the new american
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:52.760]  he says this is a project that has failed to overcome christianity
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:56.040]  and the identity of the nation state and the values and responsibilities that
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:59.000]  spring from that in conventional political struggle it will
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.320]  strive to eliminate it now on ethnic grounds say they're going to divide and
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:07.400]  conquer us culturally they're going to get rid of the national
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:11.080]  borders and then they're going to bring in the new world order
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:14.920]  with climate treaties with trade so-called trade treaties
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:21.480]  those both both of those treaties have multinational governance and built
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:25.400]  into them in terms of these governing committees they have the ability to
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:30.600]  uh to to do economic sanctions to us in one case in the climate change
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:34.760]  scenario they can directly tax us with a transnational
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:40.200]  governing body now orban who is the prime minister of turkey
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:44.440]  says that uh he was referring to collectivist open borders european
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:49.240]  union mentality that seeks to replace nationalism with internationalism this
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.360]  is the new american article i'm reading from he says
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:55.800]  if countries can be so balkanized the people no longer are a people but rather
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:59.640]  than just a disparate collection of peoples
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:03.320]  then there will be little sense of nationhood hence little resistance to a
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:06.200]  loss of sovereignty and a dissolution of borders that's
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.640]  exactly the problem isn't it anthony they're going to balkanize
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:13.000]  the united states are going to balkanize and we see this already happening
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:18.040]  in in europe and we know that once they do that and they divide people and they
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:22.280]  get rid of the national borders as as uh they've said they're they're a
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:25.960]  figment of our imagination they're a shibboleth they need to go away
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:29.560]  well once they homogenize and assimilate everyone
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:32.760]  into the same linear system that they've established through the
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:36.360]  establishment system then they will have complete control and
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:40.040]  you know the biggest threat i've always said to the establishment structure
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:44.840]  the corrupt structure is not change in certain areas like let's say oh we
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:47.880]  could retake the food supply or we could you know fight
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:51.480]  immigration or whatever those are all different sectors of it
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:56.040]  but it's the idea of the desire for change that is the biggest threat
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:01.080]  and so many people don't have that desire for one reason or another
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:04.120]  to the extent that sure let's say we fix the border situation
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:06.920]  right that would be great or let's say we did retake the food supply
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:10.760]  amazing but in 24 hours less than 24 hours
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:14.040]  we could change everything across the full spectrum
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:19.160]  if we just had 50 of people decided they want to change
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:22.280]  genuinely fight the establishment structure and the way they fight that
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:25.640]  is if you say i want change i want to fix this i want this reform they say
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:28.760]  you're racist you're sexist you're this same thing we saw with the police
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:31.960]  brutality as i was talking about that situation that happened in all white
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:35.000]  community out in Idaho with a rancher getting shot
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.280]  very much a parallel what we see happening in the cities of them using
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:41.240]  excessive force letting somebody bleed out without calling an ambulance
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:44.520]  and everything but you know in in new york they're very easily it's easy for
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:48.200]  them to turn that into a racial thing and of course that's another
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:51.320]  george soros organization their black lives matter
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:56.200]  and if they can do that they can stifle that dissent they can stifle that
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:58.760]  desire for reform it's true and then what i want to
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:02.440]  talk about today is the big secret on how we're kept down
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.400]  by this establishment system call it whatever you want
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.640]  by you know the modern day society the corrupt government elements whatever
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:11.560]  you really want to call it or believe it is
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:16.520]  we are being kept down and we are forced against uprising in many ways
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.640]  through so many different things and i want to break it all down through the
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:22.600]  political correctness but it really starts at birth
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:25.560]  and i've got a number of studies i want to get to on this subject and some other
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:29.000]  news as well but if you think about it all of
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.280]  us really are born with different traits and skills
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:36.600]  and opportunities right some of us are born with a creativity side right some
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:41.000]  of us want to be painters or musicians some of us are calculus experts right
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.200]  that's their everyone's passion is something but different and what the
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:47.320]  establishment does is it takes all of these people
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:51.800]  imagine billions of people and shoves them into a trash compactor
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:55.560]  and just starts smashing them up to make them more
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:59.320]  you know processed and one size fits all like the school system
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:03.160]  we are the food supply yeah right there's there's apples and tomatoes and
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:06.840]  oranges and corn and all these amazing vegetables and fruits and
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:10.920]  you know produce and it's almost like the establishment says no i just want
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:14.600]  to spam you know that meat they just say no we want to make spam from all of
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:17.800]  this they want to make goulash so they just shove it all in a trash compactor
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:20.920]  and build it all up it's all green yeah exactly but
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:24.360]  it's like it's like if nickolai tesla were born
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:29.000]  today he would probably work at 7-eleven because
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.760]  you are told from birth when you enter the school system
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:36.040]  or even by the parents that unfortunately buy into this bs
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:39.960]  that you will not you cannot have big dreams you will not do that you have to
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:43.320]  go to school you have to go to college you have to get a 401k
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:47.400]  and if you divert from that god help you you will be a failure i was told
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:51.160]  if i did not complete you know my college studies and do all this stuff and
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:55.880]  get a stable job a stable job is something admirable like a plumber
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:59.000]  right that i would just be a complete failure i mean you know how many people
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.680]  told me that a lot of people told me that and people i know
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:05.960]  are just so depressed and upset because they are not they don't want to be
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:08.440]  homogenized they're on the far spectrum maybe they're
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:11.000]  extremely creative maybe a lot of listeners right now are extremely
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.760]  creative they're being forced into a data collection job or some garbage
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:17.560]  right they're just so upset it's the establishment
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:23.480]  ruining any ability of that we have to uprise any ability to speak our
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:26.920]  talents and help people and have individuality and freedom you know i
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:31.160]  would rather my sons be self-employed plumber than to be a highly paid
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:35.480]  bureaucrat in this oppressive regime you know spying on people or you know
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:39.560]  interfering in other people's lives and ruining their lives you know as an
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:42.520]  interloper i would prefer that they that they take a job
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:45.160]  regardless of the amount of money that they have that gives them
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:48.680]  freedom and independence in a self-employed situation
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:52.520]  uh because that's what i value well it's whatever i believe whatever they can do
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:55.720]  they want to do and they can make it in such a way that they help other people
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:58.600]  exactly right making money by hurting people that's
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:01.560]  right and if they make a money make a ton of money that's awesome
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.240]  more good people need to make money but we need to make make money and be able
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:08.280]  to help people at the same time but if you look at japan
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:13.160]  this is from dbc why does japan have such a high suicide rate it's astronomical
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:16.760]  last year in japan more than 25 000 people took their own lives
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:21.320]  that's 70 every day the vast majority were men these figures do not make japan
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:24.040]  the highest suicide rate in the world and developed nation
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:27.960]  that dubious title belongs to south korea but it is still far far higher than
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:31.160]  virtually all other wealthy countries well gee why is that and why is it the
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:35.160]  same with south korea because the work system
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:39.400]  the establishment system the corporate vampiric system
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:43.400]  where you are a pig and it just leeches on you and drinks your blood
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:46.520]  you will work you will work 12 hours a day you will support your family if you
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:50.040]  don't have a 401k if you don't bring home money for your family you will be
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:52.600]  shamed you are a failure you must support those
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:55.800]  systems and to the point where i've talked to people that worked at samsung
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:59.080]  and stuff they would sleep there and they would just tell their wives and
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:02.680]  stuff i'm busy at the real family it was work before family
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:06.840]  it was work before everything else so that's why they're killing themselves
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:11.080]  they're depressed because they're living against what their blueprint is for
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:13.480]  humanity which is actually to do something creative
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:16.840]  do something to help other people and all of us are being pushed into this
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:18.920]  system and i'm not saying quit your job and become
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:22.040]  hippy on the beach i'm saying to realize this is how they keep us
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:24.840]  down is very important that's why there's very few leaders out there
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:27.720]  because no one has the courage to break free from the mold
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:33.800]  understand how the the how society is forcing its values on you forcing you
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:37.240]  to do something i have friends back in north carolina
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:40.520]  they were japanese and they had an expression the nail that sticks up
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:45.080]  gets hammered down okay they did not want to have any individuality they
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:48.920]  wanted your values to be those of the corporation that you worked for
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:52.840]  those of the society that you were meant to serve you were to be a cog in the
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:55.160]  wheel when we adopted my daughter from china
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:58.200]  her foster family that she had been living with
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:02.600]  gave her a note we had it translated he says uh obey your government
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:07.000]  do what you are told i mean that's what they are told and yeah that was his
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.720]  parting advice to her you know obey your government and said well
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:14.840]  it's going to get a different education from me yeah absolutely i mean if the
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:17.640]  establishment had their way the corrupt elements in the government the
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:20.680]  corporate system that makes money often you know it's all for for profit gain
[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:24.680]  and all that kind of stuff you would just be a drone human being
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:28.200]  that wore all all white or all black you would have no
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:32.280]  different you know facial structure you just be a a clone creature that just
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:36.120]  works and goes in and collects data and types on a keyboard and leaves and goes
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:39.160]  home to your your iv that just sucks your blood and
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:43.000]  donates it and sells it to the corporations i mean truly truly and if
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.440]  we look at the single view and and i have to get the
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:50.040]  the onion thing that my that my son sent me was absolutely hilarious
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:54.200]  uh it was something that was put out as a mock thing from a university saying
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:58.840]  we do support the viewpoint you know in other words a single viewpoint we're
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:01.080]  going to support and that's what's really behind
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:04.680]  all of this political correctness all this shaming of anybody
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:09.000]  if you question the viewpoint that is being put out by
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.800]  the establishment and that's the real essence of a college education
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:18.680]  is to make sure that you conform okay in the name of whatever they're doing at
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:22.520]  that point in time whether it's it's a some phony narrative about
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:26.120]  white privilege or racism or sexism or whatever the
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:29.720]  the boogeyman of the year that's not really even important as it is that they
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:33.400]  can shame you into doing whatever they want you to do
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:36.760]  because if we allow them to get away with this then we're going to have the
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:40.200]  kind of regimented structured societies that you see throughout asia through
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:42.680]  japan through south korea and other places like that
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:46.920]  political correctness without question is a form of control and dominance
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:50.920]  it is a form of mental tyranny because it can it can
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:55.960]  take over an ideology and just destroy it it can it can control people like
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:59.080]  nothing else for example if we're having a conversation and you say
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:02.840]  anything in a public setting and i declare you a racist
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:06.120]  i instantly have power over you if you don't know how to handle a situation
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:08.360]  let's say we're you know we're talking about something and you go i don't like
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:11.800]  that black suit and i said oh my god you are how racist of you are in front of
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:14.760]  20 people though i instantly have power in the room
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:17.640]  because no one is going to defy the political correctness because they've
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:21.240]  been trained through this system of the schooling system
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:24.200]  of the parents that buy into this this fake
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:28.440]  weak system of oh my god can't defend anyone that i have power now by calling
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:30.840]  you racist and it's in your court to defend yourself
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:33.720]  absolutely you don't play that game you say this is absolutely ridiculous but
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:37.160]  that's brilliant about what that's what's brilliant and popular about
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:41.160]  donald trump he refuses to play that game he refuses to be
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:45.160]  shamed by that and regardless whether you agree with his policies or not
[02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:48.840]  that i think is a key thing behind it the more they attack him the more popular
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:51.320]  he gets we'll be right back with anthony gucciardi a special

[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:03.880]  defense at info wars life dot com now i think we were talking
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:07.800]  in the last segment about not just specific things that you can do but what
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:11.400]  is the big picture and that's what we've got with the special report coming out
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:14.920]  from alex at the bottom of the hour but continue with what you were saying
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:17.720]  the narrative that is really the big picture
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.400]  is this ideology that's passed down by parents or it's passed down by
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:24.040]  universities or schools or institutions or the media or
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:29.960]  hollywood it's really a uniform attack that you have to follow the
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:33.800]  establishment system or you are a failure and your success
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:37.800]  and your life is measured by those parameters and those parameters only
[02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:41.560]  which is probably the biggest lie ever told yes and it's the reason people
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:43.960]  kill themselves it's the reason that we're depressed
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:46.680]  it's the reason that we don't have real change on a daily basis
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:50.040]  it's the reason that we're desperate for a true leader
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:53.800]  it's the reason that people are absolutely clamoring over trump in many
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:56.840]  ways because he's kind of going against the narrative
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:00.040]  say what you will about him he goes against the narrative in many ways
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:03.080]  but what happens is and it's kind of like this article
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:06.840]  it says kids of helicopter parents are sputtering out which is a silly title
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:09.240]  but it says recent studies suggest that kids with
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:12.600]  over-involved parents and rigidly structured childhood suffer psychological
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:16.280]  blowback in college basically they're getting depressed
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:19.240]  they're they're killing themselves they're going to college and what's
[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:22.840]  happening is it's not it is the parents fault but it's not
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:25.880]  because what happens is and i'm not a parenting expert i'm just talking about
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:29.880]  the psychology of it these children grow up
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:34.040]  and their parents are maybe lawyers or doctors or accountants or whatever it is
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:36.840]  that the establishment rewards like oh a lawyer
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:39.960]  and they're like well and i've met tons of people like this that have
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:43.640]  extreme anxiety well i have to make my parents happy and follow this
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:47.080]  establishment system i need to go to law school and become a
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:50.840]  lawyer or i'm worthless right maybe even though they were born
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:55.960]  with talents for art or something like that or science or something no i have
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:59.160]  to follow the linear structure of the establishment where i'm a loser
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:02.040]  so many people think this we all think this in many ways because the
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:04.920]  establishment is is just hitting us like a spider
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:08.120]  and i think a key part of that is school that's where a lot of this stuff
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:11.880]  starts i know we have schooled our kids we were looking at this and it's like
[02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:14.520]  all right well you know they want me to take these tests they have the kids
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:17.880]  take these tests and everything but if you teach to the test you know you want
[02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:21.320]  the kids to do well in the test so then you style your curriculum to
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:24.280]  teach that test and so forth and so on so then you're teaching
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:28.200]  what they want you to teach in the sequence that they want you to teach
[02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:31.720]  stuff in the way that they want you to teach it we just said we don't care
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:34.440]  about that it was a very freeing thing to say you know i don't really care about
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:36.600]  the tests we're not gonna we're gonna teach you that
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:40.440]  dare you i could care less about you know the how they do on test because you
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:43.480]  know what kids fail in government schools all the time
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:47.000]  right they've got a very failure rate so it's like if they can't get the kids to
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.120]  take the test i really could care less about what their scope and their
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:53.400]  sequences so we're going to follow what we're interested in we're going to do
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:56.200]  what we and you have to at some point you have to just say that about
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:29:00.520]  everything in your life i'm not going to let somebody else set my priorities
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:03.560]  and bound me into their idea of what i should be
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:06.520]  see and that and that's the main point i also want to get into
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:11.160]  how failure to understand details is probably one of the other biggest issues
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:13.800]  but specifically let's say these kids you know they don't want to be a lawyer
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:16.520]  whatever but the system tells them they have to their parents tell them they
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:19.800]  have to they have a psychological break some of them killed themselves but to
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:23.320]  put that in a broader spectrum imagine if me and you decided to follow this
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:26.520]  narrative and go to school and become plumbers or whatever i mean we want to
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:30.040]  went against what we are meant to do and so many people are failing to understand
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:32.520]  that as well and it's a sad thing and that's how the establishment keeps us
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:35.720]  down on a daily basis and stops us from rising up that's right
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:39.880]  absolutely how to find a freedom and an unfree world is a book that harry brown
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:43.400]  wrote that's a good example we're going to be right back with alex jones

[02:33:06.280 --> 02:33:26.200]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and anthony gucciotti is
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:29.880]  here with me in the studio we're gonna play a special report from alex jones
[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:33.240]  and yo it's interesting anthony and i were just talking about this uh he had no
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:37.640]  idea what this report was we're all on the same wavelength here because we know
[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:41.080]  what is happening we can see what's happening in europe we can see what's
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:44.680]  happening in the united states and as alex jones points out in this
[02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:48.280]  report we've reached a cultural tipping point
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:52.280]  not just here in the u.s but also in europe the elites are trying to suppress
[02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:55.560]  us under a form of cultural tyranny now the rebellion
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:59.000]  is boiling up to the surface we've reached a cultural tipping point across
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.480]  roads it's time for people across the spectrum
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:05.560]  to become leaders to stand up to say no and to point out that we see
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:08.840]  how they're trying to control us it's just what anthony was talking about as
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:11.400]  we've been here only by transcending the control
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:14.440]  paradigm can we defeat them so it's very hard to do
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:21.320]  while at the same time it can also be very very easy to do here's alex jones
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:26.280]  my friends i'm not telling you anything you don't already know
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:32.120]  when i say we're in a culture war but the controlled media has divided into
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:36.440]  conservative and liberal when you pull back from that and
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:41.240]  study the different congressional hearings and other key documents
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:44.680]  on operation mockingbird and other cia operations
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:49.400]  you learn that there are big foundations multinational corporations
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:53.720]  think tanks intelligence agencies private corporate criminal groups and
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:58.040]  others that for the last hundred years have been meeting in large
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:03.640]  global conferences discussing aligning their interest to bring in a one
[02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:07.080]  world corporate government now they've had some wars with each
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:10.520]  other they had some major disagreements and that's
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:14.120]  still going on to this day the anglo-american establishment
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:18.920]  the chinese now the communist chinese and of course the russians
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:22.120]  the germans for a time vied to be a fourth group
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:26.920]  and were destroyed conquered assimilated and now are used as the slave
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:30.760]  engine of the e u the core of world government
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:35.000]  that said we talk a lot about the info war we talk about how we're having big
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.560]  victories fighting mainstream news dinosaur media
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:43.560]  but i've talked also a lot about the fact that most propaganda is in movies
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:50.760]  is in fiction television fiction novels that's where the real war is going on
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:55.320]  we have to focus more and more on the propaganda on the messages and when you
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:36:00.760]  look at the messages that dominate the so-called
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:05.240]  spectrum of fiction that's being pushed by the big six media companies
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:08.200]  it's anti-private property it's anti free will
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:12.760]  it's anti-family it's anti self-defense it's anti free choice
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:19.000]  it is anti true classical liberalism and i've been hammering on this
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:23.160]  real liberal versus fake liberal we've had a major breakthrough so what i'm
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:26.840]  about to cover here is one of the major keys unlocking all of this
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:30.440]  but you have to unlock it and what i'm going to point out is something a lot
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:34.200]  of you already know we've seen articles in the
[02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:37.160]  washington times and the la times and others about
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:40.520]  closeted libertarians and conservatives in hollywood
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:43.880]  and how they have secret meetings i have been
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:47.160]  led into some of those quote secret meetings it's just small groups of
[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:50.040]  people getting together and talking about the paranoid
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:53.400]  and they've told me about even larger groups that they've met in secret
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:56.920]  intellectual circles of what you would call some of the most
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:01.480]  truly liberal people out there who are bullied and threatened into being
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:04.760]  establishment liberals or they're told you won't get any more roles
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:09.720]  no matter how many hits you've had now hollywood's loss and was power over
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:12.520]  the years and has become decentralized to a certain extent
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:16.760]  not completely but partially to move to canada move to texas move to new
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:23.720]  zealand other areas so there's a little more
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:29.560]  courage now to tell the truth but the true liberals in hollywood don't like
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:32.520]  the fact that they have to then join the conservatives which are just as bad in
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:36.120]  most respects the rhinos now you know i've had a lot of big
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:39.880]  hollywood people on show from vego mortensen to
[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:43.400]  basically you name it and a lot of big stars have tweeted or talked about how
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:47.800]  they like alex jones but the really big ones people even
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:51.080]  bigger than some of the folks i've had on are scared to come out and scared to go
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:54.680]  public to the point of like every few weeks
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:58.600]  now a major hollywood star reaches out to me one way or another
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:01.720]  but are always like but just don't tell anybody that we're on board
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:05.960]  well i already know you're on board and you're not on board with alex jones
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:09.000]  or info wars dot com we're just a focal point
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.720]  and every time i talk to these folks they're not just listening to me they're
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:15.720]  they're dialed into all of it more than i am in many respects
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:19.240]  they're smarter than i am in many ways more eloquent better looking
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:22.360]  they could change the world and they're getting ready to do it
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:25.560]  people are really tired of what's happening they're tired of the global
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:29.720]  fascism that comes from both parties they see the same stuff in europe
[02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:33.720]  they're upset but they understand there's cultural bullying going on and
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:37.240]  that's what modern fake liberalism is it's not
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:40.360]  whacked out that they want to ban brown paper bags and pull down thomas
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:43.800]  jefferson statues and ban the words mother and father he and she boy or
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:46.520]  girl you think that's too extreme it's meant to be extreme
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:51.560]  to break our will to accept anything now i've already said most of this what i'm
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:55.320]  getting at is that there's a culture war going on
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:59.800]  the globalist pump out all this mindless confusion and garbage and in fighting
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:03.080]  and controlled left and controlled right so that people just tune out and don't
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:08.120]  have any hope i'm here to tell you there's major hope
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.080]  and we have to realize how popular the anti-globalist pro-human new renaissance
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:18.040]  movement as i branded it is the new enlightenment
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:22.120]  the second wave it's here and all of this tyranny we see
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:24.840]  is an admitted attempt i mean the globalist white papers are public we
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:28.440]  cover them on air all the time they're they're admitting they're in a war
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:31.720]  against true cultural freedom i mean you look at what comes out of the
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:34.440]  democratic party that's the dominant culture america that's the dominant
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:37.720]  culture in the world it is jim jones level programming and
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:39.800]  it's meant to be i had a top professor on just
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:42.760]  yesterday who heads up the asian studies department
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:45.800]  you see davis he went to the rock and fellow program and he says no it's an
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:49.400]  admitted malice program actually following mal tactics
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:52.840]  in the meetings to brainwash and screw up the young people
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:56.600]  and to take all their faith and love for humanity and twist it
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:59.560]  that's why you see these zombies out breaking up free speech events they
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:03.560]  look so upset and so crazy and so wild eyed because they've been screwed with
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:07.960]  folks with high tech sciences so here's what i'm getting at i've
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:10.600]  talked a lot about voting with your dollars voting with your mouth voting
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:14.520]  with your feet voting with what you support but also what you produce
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:18.040]  you need to do your own youtube channels or set up your own video systems
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:22.520]  whatever you need to invade these corporate systems and then push
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:25.960]  their traffic back towards your alternative side
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:29.000]  not that you're going to have all the answers but you'll be another point
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  that isn't within the system for us to get back to a real reality
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.520]  by pinging info off each other not just the controlled feedback loop that the
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:40.440]  globalists are pushing us and what made me
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.520]  think about this was a couple things the last few days
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:47.560]  one big one was yesterday we put out a fun little ad video we got to fund
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:51.000]  ourselves the global stack like it's bad for any new cultural
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.440]  movement to have its own funding they tax us and use our money against us
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:58.360]  it's bad if we with free will write a book or make a film or sell a product
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:01.960]  again trying to intimidate us is if we can't have ideas when we have ideas it's
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:05.080]  a conspiracy theory when we have an opinion or a taste
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:09.000]  it's a conspiracy theory or extreme or when we build our own system and are
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:12.440]  successful it's bad well of course that's what they say
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:15.960]  but we shot this video some of my friends barefoot skiing and they love
[02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:19.480]  one of our products and a minority of the comments were like how dare you be
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:22.280]  water skiing when everything's falling apart
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:25.800]  you need to be fighting a new world order this from people that
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:29.480]  i went look at their channels have done nothing they're like playing video games
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:32.200]  and stuff fine just don't don't judge me
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:35.560]  part of winning the fight against the tyrants is not being a bunch of
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:38.440]  scared upset people in secret meetings it's
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:42.680]  it's part of going out having fun creating our own culture
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:46.280]  our own music i might write a book that's just humor
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:49.720]  with nothing in it about the new world order then folks will come find my
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:54.040]  serious work you know all of us need to express our humanity make art
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:57.720]  not just be into fighting the fellow reserve we need to do that too
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:01.160]  but we need to be balanced we need to be fun we need to be
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:04.760]  the true liberals of culture the true americana that the world
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:09.000]  loved and wanted to come here to be part of call it paleo conservative call it
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.440]  libertarian everyone call it live and let live
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:16.040]  tolerant but i don't have to adopt your way of living i'm not going to be
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:18.920]  conquered by you whether you're some super right-wing
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:21.640]  group that wants women to wear skirts down to their feet or some radical
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:24.680]  muslim group that wants to mutilate women and put bags on their heads or
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:28.840]  whether you'd be some other weird you know cult or some liberal pc group
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:32.280]  that wants to teach five-year-olds you know how to wear dresses
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:35.720]  these are all just unhappy cults pushing their agenda on those of us the
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:39.560]  producers it's time for us to stand up and shrug this off our shoulders
[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:43.080]  and to be proud that we're building a new culture
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:45.480]  the globalists don't want you to have a culture they want you to just have no
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:48.600]  culture be afraid watch tv and let them program you
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:52.760]  i'm saying be your culture be yourself really produce what comes from your
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:55.800]  heart produce art produce literature stand up
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:59.240]  believe in yourself don't let madison avenue tell you you're junk
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:02.280]  they always make you feel inadequate then they sell you their solution that
[02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:06.360]  will make you adequate and again that just ties back
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:09.720]  into this point that we're supposed to be losers we're supposed to be underground
[02:43:09.720 --> 02:43:15.640]  we're supposed to not be successful word i cannot tell you in my 20 years on
[02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:19.800]  air 21 years in just a few months in april coming
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:23.080]  up 21 years i cannot tell you the success i've had
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:25.880]  the people we've touched because of you spreading the word
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:29.960]  and others and now it's just reached a crescendo
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:34.920]  level we're so many incredible enlightened people that
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:39.160]  do are involved in so many good causes but haven't gone to
[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:42.360]  the next level of really being public about what they truly believe
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:45.960]  because they know the public's been dumbed down into a controlled paradigm
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:49.000]  well the answer is fighting back against that paradigm and just saying i don't
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.960]  care of a bunch of people don't understand it i don't care of a bunch of
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:56.760]  people get confused by it i'm not going to be bullied anymore
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:00.200]  and i'm going to put out complex info to raise the dialogue
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:03.160]  the globalist admit they've had a great front line piece on this years ago
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:07.480]  about a feedback loop where they put garbage out on purpose
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:11.080]  to dumb the debate down it's not we're dumb so they've done the debate down
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:13.720]  now we've reached that level mission accomplished to a certain extent we've
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:17.320]  hit the bottom now let's go back up but before it was dumb the message down
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:21.160]  to dumb you down the message is the medium
[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:24.520]  versus the medium is the message it's both but they dumb it down
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:28.040]  to make you dumb until you accept it until you're immersed in it
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:33.960]  as a weapon against your free will so all the big Hollywood stars out there
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:37.320]  that are true classical liberals the thomas jefferson vane and the trailblazing
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:41.080]  vane you need to go public and if you want to do
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:43.560]  it in a safe space you know to use that term in a
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:48.040]  taped interview or have somebody else do it or whatever it's time
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:50.920]  i mean i'm just shooting this here at my cousin's condo you know with
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:53.560]  he and his wife we're not doing this some big fancy production
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:57.240]  maybe it's off the cuff maybe maybe you test the waters but
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:00.840]  the the amazing things you stand for the the the eloquent statements you've
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:04.600]  made those need to be heard by the world
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:08.680]  i mean the fact that somebody like jeff bridges is awake to the new world order
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:12.040]  for years and is a lister of my show that's a big
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:15.240]  deal and i haven't even reached out to jeff bridges yet
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:18.040]  he was with some folks that reached out the other night i missed the call
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:22.040]  but the point is is that jeff bridges i'm sure if he comes out against the
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:25.560]  globalist we'll get targeted but we're already all being targeted anyways
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:29.000]  it's time for all those big names people even bigger than jeff
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:30.760]  bridges it's hard to believe there's anybody bigger than jeff bridges
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:35.560]  there's certainly nobody cooler the dude um you know star man tron the whole
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:39.400]  nine yards um but there are people
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:43.640]  bigger when it comes to money bigger in music as big as it gets you think of the
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:47.240]  top they're awake and they just said nope we
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:50.120]  just can't handle we can't come on air and that was years ago
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:54.680]  and and i understand all that it's just this is so exciting to me when i'm
[02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:57.960]  talking about it it's even cold in here i started sweating because this is so
[02:45:57.960 --> 02:46:02.360]  epic what's going on in this world it's so huge
[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:05.720]  and we're going to lose our future we're going to lose our souls we're going to
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:09.080]  lose our humanity we're going to lose it all if we don't say no to this fraud
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:14.200]  on the system and the tyranny that is the control left the control right
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:18.040]  and so we are the winners the liberty movement is popular
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:22.120]  it's surging that's why they got all these subliminal messages targeting me in
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:24.920]  the media and others it's why they're doing all these hit pieces and
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:28.600]  misrepresenting what i and others say it's because they're scared
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:33.240]  well the people serving the system i talked to generals top producers
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:36.200]  most of them don't want to serve the evil they just don't have faith in
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:40.360]  humanity well here's the deal humanity on average are followers
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:45.000]  i'm talking to leaders out there whether you're a school principal or a police
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.360]  chief or a fire department chief or deputy chief or
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:52.520]  you know a doctor a psychologist people who think it was leaders a preacher a
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:55.880]  pastor buck this corporate down destruction of
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:59.080]  society say no be yourself don't follow what i say
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:02.680]  because what i'm saying is follow your common sense
[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:06.280]  there's just so many amazing people that are awake and then i think about when i
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:09.160]  was on a plane years ago flying to be on the
[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:13.320]  view i'll say this in closing in in first class of sitting around
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:16.440]  explaining why i'm in first class some little cultural Marxist thing and i
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:19.720]  shouldn't be in first class the point is they're flying to be on the view
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:23.640]  and there's the head he knew who i was sitting right beside me
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:27.960]  in first class the head of one of the major banks one of the biggest top five
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:32.280]  and i'm like is this who i think it is and then he figures out who i am and
[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:35.160]  he's and we have like an hour discussion there's a three-hour flight to new york
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:39.800]  but we only really talked the last hour and i told the story many times but just
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:44.040]  a paraphrase that he just said you don't get if humanity does evolve you
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:47.160]  think they'll evolve and adapt and overcome what we're doing to them
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:49.720]  people say will say his name and we said this isn't confident so i can't break
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:55.000]  that it's a journalism 101 he said humanity will adapt to
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:59.560]  being enslaved you don't get it we slowly enslave
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:03.480]  you that's why we do it slow so you adapt and learn to submit to that and
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:06.760]  then you love it and he said the corporations are
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:10.040]  going to govern the planet and we know how to do it best
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:13.960]  and he was cynical and he had his jacket suit on perfectly like he was a mannequin
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:17.400]  he got up put on his perfect you know he was like a robot and just and looked at
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:22.920]  me to stand playing laugh as he walked off that plane in front of me
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:27.640]  and that's who those people are they don't have faith in humanity well i do
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:31.000]  but beyond that there are people who could have joined that evil banker and
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.880]  been manipulative and more powerful than him but they had humanity they didn't
[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:37.880]  because you're humble you don't want to dominate i understand that but you got
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:41.160]  to get the bully off of you you got to get the bully off the little guys too
[02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:45.000]  you got to stand up to these guys because you've got the power you've got
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:48.120]  the light the dark of the night we've all got to do it
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:51.400]  general public movie stars politicians all of you
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:55.320]  we got to transcend that's my rant this is how we can defeat the globalist take
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:48:58.920]  over the culture we are the culture liberty is the culture our roots are
[02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:02.600]  still here they can spring back up they may have cut this tree down but it's
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:05.400]  growing back it's growing back right in front of us
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:08.280]  let's water it let's take care of it we can do it
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:12.200]  look at what were the alternative to this new world order look how crappy it is
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:15.960]  look at what it has to offer look at the politicians falling apart look at
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:19.880]  both parties look at the global elite they're a joke
[02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:23.960]  they're only strong because we've laid down it's time to
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:27.880]  awaken and come out of the coma it's time for humanity to rise
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:32.040]  to the stars and beyond
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:34.680]  exactly right that's what we've been talking about isn't it anthony it's
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:38.120]  interesting that you both chose the same thing to talk about today but of course
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:42.680]  we can see this happening every day in the daily news and i've talked about
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:47.400]  how this is leveling of the culture destroying the
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:53.000]  national borders so these guys can impose a multinational corporate global
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.600]  governance on us through these mechanisms of fines
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:00.600]  and other bureaucratic agencies that will be able to
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:03.880]  assess things in different countries go ahead it is amazing that we were just
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:07.160]  speaking about that exact topic and then he comes in and he says he has a
[02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:12.040]  special report and it's it's the same thing the truth is we can rise up as
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:17.160]  the human spirit and we can defeat all of it it is a cultural attack it is a
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:20.360]  mental attack it is an ideological attack at the
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:23.480]  deepest levels because it's not just about the main issues like we were
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:27.240]  talking about it's not like just about border patrol

[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:33.800]  issues no no it's a systematic attack on the human
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:37.720]  consciousness to push us down and to make us think we're weak and worth
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:41.240]  nothing when we are worth so much we can defeat all of this at the same time if

[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:38.200]  hungarian prime minister is saying what's going on in hungary says who gave the
[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:42.040]  order who has the authority to open up our borders and then to take them down
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:47.240]  this is a preplanned uh take down a treasonous conspiracy and he names
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:51.080]  george soros who happens to also be hungarian yeah he knows where this guy
[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:54.680]  is coming from okay alex jones he's that you see it you're talking about i'm
[02:55:54.680 --> 02:55:57.000]  seeing it talking about everybody's talking about this and of course the
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:01.960]  onion is talking about it college exchange encourages lively exchange of
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:06.920]  idea singular okay students faculty invite to freely express a single
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:10.520]  viewpoint is they saying such dialogue is essential to the college's
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:14.200]  college's academic mission the university president confirmed monday
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:18.920]  that school encourages a lively exchange of one idea quote as an
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:21.480]  institution of higher learning we recognize it's inevitable
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:24.680]  that certain contentious topics will come up from time to time when they do
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:28.120]  we want to create an atmosphere where both students and faculty feel
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:32.840]  comfortable voicing a single homogeneous opinion because i'm gonna say
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:36.440]  anyone on campus is always welcome to add their support to the accepted
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:41.000]  consensus that's basically it i mean you're talking whether you're talking
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:45.800]  about uh the weather or anything else they have a consensus and you're
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:49.080]  welcome to to join along or you will be shut up and
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:53.080]  unfortunately that is the spot on satire from the onion
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:56.840]  that might as well be a cnn article i mean if you think about it go to the
[02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:01.400]  university of missouri no really but i would also say
[02:57:01.400 --> 02:57:04.760]  that uh the number one reason all that happens
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:08.920]  the reason that we all homogenize into the one idea besides the establishment
[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:13.080]  system is because people are afraid of details
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:18.120]  they just cannot handle details that's why left versus right is so pervasive
[02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:21.560]  yeah unfortunately people have been brought up
[02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:24.360]  a large percentage of the population through the establishment system i'm
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:26.840]  not judging people it's not you know that they're
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:31.080]  they're idiots they've been brought up like this to really just pick
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:34.840]  red or blue or or one or two there's no in between there's no
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:38.280]  there's no sliding scale of information or options or ideas
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:42.600]  and the universities have they're like mass manufacturers
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:46.520]  of single viewpoints it's the antithesis of what used to be a liberal
[02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:48.920]  education exactly give you the tools of learning
[02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:52.920]  help you to make decisions put up multiple viewpoints challenge each other
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:56.120]  no they want a single viewpoint sometimes they offer us a false dichotomy
[02:57:56.120 --> 02:57:58.520]  they say well it's either this or it's either that
[02:57:58.520 --> 02:58:02.360]  as a banana or a rotting apple exactly but that's not the case but now what
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:05.960]  they're doing increasingly is just pushing out a single viewpoint you
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:10.200]  saw that cartoon up there uh Nico found the guy comes back to the
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:13.480]  college and hands and piece of paper says this is my degree
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:17.160]  i want my money back it's not working that's right because
[02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:20.520]  it's not designed to make you money it wasn't designed to make you a free
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:23.640]  thinker they want to shut down any free thought any
[02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:28.840]  challenge challenging of the accepted consensus stay back when we return thank

[02:58:31.800 --> 02:58:34.920]  the established consensus and what they're about to do

[03:00:09.480 --> 03:00:16.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host we're going to be
[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:20.280]  taking your calls later in the hour this segment i'd like to go over is just
[03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:24.200]  some of the miscellaneous news that we've seen here this pretty big actually
[03:00:24.200 --> 03:00:27.640]  you know this was something that came that was up on our site since yesterday
[03:00:27.640 --> 03:00:33.640]  glass stigl takes center stage in 2016 that sounds kind of walkie doesn't it
[03:00:33.640 --> 03:00:36.600]  glass stigl well actually you may have heard a lot of
[03:00:36.600 --> 03:00:41.880]  people talking about this but it isn't uh it isn't really a wonky policy
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:47.080]  issue no they put that in in 1933 they removed it in the year 2000
[03:00:47.080 --> 03:00:50.680]  and basically as the hill describes i think it's a very succinct description of
[03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:55.560]  it they say it's a firewall between investment and commercial banking
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:59.160]  exactly see when they had the crash they said well we had all these runs on
[03:00:59.160 --> 03:01:01.960]  banks so we want people to understand that their money is going to be secure
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:05.800]  in the banks so we're going to let banks have federal deposit
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:09.160]  insurance so the fdic was created the federal deposit insurance corporation
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:13.000]  they were going to ensure deposits up to and now the limit is like a hundred
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:16.040]  thousand dollars i don't know probably didn't start out that high
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:19.480]  but they ensure your deposits up to a certain level if you put more than that
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:23.640]  in one bank you know that you're rich but you're also
[03:01:23.640 --> 03:01:27.640]  know that you're putting some risk in that that is not insured now in
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:30.600]  exchange for that insurance the software from the federal government
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:34.280]  what they're going to do is they as part of glass stigl
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:37.640]  they said we are not going to let the banks get involved
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:41.080]  in risky investments in other words we're going to keep them out of wall street
[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:44.920]  we're going to not let them buy stock on margin
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:48.040]  so they could go down they could put a very little amount just a portion of
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:52.680]  the price of the stock buy it on credit if you will they call that margin buying
[03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:56.360]  so they could buy it with just a little bit down and they could leverage that
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:01:59.960]  and see the banks are already leveraging a lot of money because they're able to
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:02.840]  essentially create money by the money that they borrow from the federal reserve
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:06.680]  and then loan it back out on deposit so that okay that's enough you guys can do
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:10.280]  that that's going to be your business you're going to be very conservative
[03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:13.480]  people are going to know that the stuff is safe because we're going to keep you
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:16.680]  conservatively invested and we're going to ensure their deposits anything but
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:19.640]  then they took all that off in the year 2000
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:23.320]  and that was while the clintons were still there remember and yet how did all
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:27.640]  these banks get so big to fail well that was a clintons again
[03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:31.160]  okay you understand i'm not giving the republicans a free pass on this
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:34.840]  they were part of this as well and george bush and the republicans
[03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:38.120]  ran through the bailouts for the banks when it all came crashing down but how
[03:02:38.120 --> 03:02:42.360]  did they build this bubble how did the banks get too big to fail
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:46.920]  as i pointed out before the essential merger that began this
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:49.880]  runaway consolidation that eventually gave us a
[03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:53.400]  handful half dozen six or seven banks that were too big to fail that had to be
[03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:56.440]  bailed out they told us and again they didn't have to be
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:02:59.000]  bailed out but the ones that had so much power that they could get the
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:02.360]  government to bail them out and tell us lies about it
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:05.320]  that all began under the clinton administration
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:08.360]  it began with the in north carolina actually
[03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:11.720]  it was bank of america moved their headquarters north carolina when they
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:14.840]  did a nations bank merger and at the time everybody said they'll that'll
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:17.640]  never get approved those two banks are too big
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:20.920]  it's going to create a rush of consolidation that we don't want to
[03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:24.520]  have in this country but it got approved and it got approved i
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:27.640]  believe because of people who were highly placed in the clinton
[03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:30.760]  administration from north carolina people like urskine bulls
[03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:34.360]  he had a lot of connections with the banking industry in in charlotte and so
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:38.040]  forth anyway for whatever reason whatever reason maybe
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:42.760]  you know influencer money past hands we're talking the clintons here okay
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:47.400]  nevertheless they consolidated they approved that merger and it was off to
[03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:50.920]  the races and then all the big banks started buying each other and smaller
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:53.960]  banks and turned into the too big to fail
[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:57.320]  now the question is what are they going to do about this a lot of people have
[03:03:57.320 --> 03:04:01.640]  said look we need to put this back in place we need to have a more sound
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:04.840]  financial system uh hillary clinton is feeling the
[03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:08.440]  heat because she is has both of her opponents on the democrat side
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:12.280]  bernie sanders and martin o'Malley are both saying we need to put
[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:16.680]  this back in they're echoing elizabeth warren saying this is a
[03:04:16.680 --> 03:04:19.880]  unacceptable risk that we're allowing the banks to take with people's money
[03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:22.680]  which means that where they're going then going to have to
[03:04:22.680 --> 03:04:26.600]  bail them out we're going to let them privatize the profits and then
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:29.640]  they're going to call on us to socialize the losses
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:33.640]  pass the losses on everybody else on the republican side interestingly enough
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:36.760]  the only candidate on the republican side who has come out
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:41.000]  in terms of and supporting putting glass seagull back in place is
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:45.480]  mike huckabee credit where credits do not a huckabee supporter but he got that

[03:08:33.960 --> 03:08:38.840]  with anthony gucciardi and with alex jones special report we've been talking
[03:08:38.840 --> 03:08:44.680]  about how a consensus is forced upon us in so many different
[03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:48.200]  ways and there was a great parody article that we mentioned
[03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:51.560]  from the onion college encourages lively exchange of
[03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:55.320]  idea students faculty invited to freely express a
[03:08:55.320 --> 03:08:59.720]  single viewpoint you're welcome to join us if you're going to be part of the
[03:08:59.720 --> 03:09:04.840]  consensus say that's what it's become the kind of intolerance and as we look
[03:09:04.840 --> 03:09:06.760]  at what's coming up at the end of this month
[03:09:06.760 --> 03:09:13.080]  this climate meeting in paris okay we need to understand
[03:09:13.080 --> 03:09:16.840]  the what what the bigger picture is and of course the bigger picture is that
[03:09:16.840 --> 03:09:20.840]  it's going to be used to establish a global governance mechanism just like
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:23.720]  the trans-pacific partnership we need to understand that just like
[03:09:23.720 --> 03:09:27.560]  the trans-pacific partnership this is something that is being presented to us
[03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:31.400]  by multinational corporations people that are going to make a lot of money
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:34.600]  when you pay them for the privilege of flipping on your light switch you're
[03:09:34.600 --> 03:09:37.800]  going to pay a tax to algor some of the other
[03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:42.120]  carbon billionaires but you're also going to be creating a
[03:09:42.120 --> 03:09:46.040]  global governance mechanism that's also going to be a part of it
[03:09:46.040 --> 03:09:49.320]  look at this article that came out yesterday alex mentioned it
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:52.520]  yesterday and it's worth going back and taking a look at this again a rasmus and
[03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:56.600]  poll said little support for punishing global warming foes well
[03:09:56.600 --> 03:10:00.600]  yes it is a small minority you might say a third of the people
[03:10:00.600 --> 03:10:04.600]  but i still think that that is pretty amazing that a third of the people
[03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:08.920]  out there they say 68 percent would not support it but that would mean 32
[03:10:08.920 --> 03:10:12.120]  percent would 68 percent of likely us voters opposed the
[03:10:12.120 --> 03:10:15.800]  government investigating and prosecuting scientists
[03:10:15.800 --> 03:10:19.720]  and others including major corporations who question global warming
[03:10:19.720 --> 03:10:23.960]  let me repeat that to you 32 percent put it the other way around
[03:10:23.960 --> 03:10:27.240]  32 percent of people one third of the people
[03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:30.680]  want the government to investigate and prosecute
[03:10:30.680 --> 03:10:35.240]  anybody that descents on the consensus opinion
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:39.400]  about global warming and its causes does that frighten you
[03:10:39.400 --> 03:10:43.640]  i mean that should frighten you that is not the scientific method
[03:10:43.640 --> 03:10:47.400]  scientific method is skeptical scientific method says
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:51.240]  we can look at the data we can keep looking at the data we will keep doing
[03:10:51.240 --> 03:10:54.840]  experiments we will continue to revise this because you know what over our
[03:10:54.840 --> 03:10:59.240]  history we have seen the consensus change many times haven't we
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:02.840]  remember you know the the discussion about
[03:11:02.840 --> 03:11:07.400]  cavernicus and Galileo and the pope everybody always puts that in as well
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:10.200]  religion versus science well it wasn't really that
[03:11:10.200 --> 03:11:14.840]  simple the true story is the the bigger story the more detailed
[03:11:14.840 --> 03:11:18.360]  story is that they had come up with a model of a Ptolemaic model
[03:11:18.360 --> 03:11:22.200]  that had the all the planets and the sun
[03:11:22.200 --> 03:11:25.720]  moving around the earth and they had actually
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:29.400]  used that for navigation and one of the reasons why
[03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:36.520]  they were so slow to go over to a sun-centered model
[03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:40.040]  was because and to throw away this geocentric model was because
[03:11:40.040 --> 03:11:43.720]  they were getting better results with that than they were with
[03:11:43.720 --> 03:11:47.480]  a model that had the sun at the center and the planets revolving around it as
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:51.240]  we have now seen and proven okay the reason
[03:11:51.240 --> 03:11:55.800]  they weren't getting very good results was because they had circular orbits
[03:11:55.800 --> 03:11:59.160]  and it wasn't until Kepler came along and said let's try
[03:11:59.160 --> 03:12:03.080]  elliptical or orbits that they got something that mathematically
[03:12:03.080 --> 03:12:07.480]  predicted positions of planets so they could use it for navigation to actually
[03:12:07.480 --> 03:12:10.920]  gave them the correct answers so the bottom line was it wasn't totally
[03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:16.120]  irrational it wasn't completely imposing religion on science
[03:12:16.120 --> 03:12:20.120]  but the point being is that even when you've got something that is a model that
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:23.560]  seems to be working correctly it can be completely wrong
[03:12:23.560 --> 03:12:26.760]  you can have a very detailed model we haven't even seen
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:29.560]  that kind of verification of these climate models because of course these
[03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:33.000]  climate models are so far out 50 years 100 years
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:36.920]  one of the reasons why meteorologists are so reluctant to buy into this when we
[03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:39.640]  were at the american meteorological association here in
[03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:42.360]  austin when they were having their annual meeting here
[03:12:42.360 --> 03:12:46.120]  rob Jacobson and i went there we saw the scientists and they're worrying about
[03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:50.200]  how do they predict the weather one two three days in advance
[03:12:50.200 --> 03:12:53.160]  they had all these different weather models that were
[03:12:53.160 --> 03:12:56.440]  not accurate and they were looking at how they could constantly tweak these
[03:12:56.440 --> 03:12:59.480]  models then test them and then tweak them again and
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:02.600]  keep through this going through this reeditive process
[03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:05.240]  trying to get something that was accurate so when you come to them and
[03:13:05.240 --> 03:13:08.360]  you say well i've got a climate model that predicts everything for 50 years
[03:13:08.360 --> 03:13:12.040]  or 100 years or multiple centuries or millennia
[03:13:12.040 --> 03:13:15.160]  it's like how do i verify this well you can't verify it so what they do is they
[03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:18.760]  sell it to you on the basis of consensus they sell it to you on the basis of
[03:13:18.760 --> 03:13:21.960]  believe me because i'm an authority and now they've
[03:13:21.960 --> 03:13:25.080]  gone beyond that now they want to shut down any
[03:13:25.080 --> 03:13:30.520]  skepticism by calling people deniers you know they are not talking about
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:33.000]  science now they're talking about religion and understand
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.880]  how this is breaking down as rasmussen pointed this out
[03:13:35.880 --> 03:13:41.480]  just over one in four democrats 27 favored prosecuting those who didn't
[03:13:41.480 --> 03:13:46.360]  agree with them on global warming they say after all
[03:13:46.360 --> 03:13:49.880]  only 24 percent of voters believe the scientific debate about global warming
[03:13:49.880 --> 03:13:53.560]  is over and those who believe that it's over
[03:13:53.560 --> 03:13:56.680]  essentially want to prosecute you if you don't agree with them
[03:13:56.680 --> 03:14:00.680]  you have to understand science is never over real science can stand the
[03:14:00.680 --> 03:14:03.320]  scrutiny and it needs to be scrutinized and if somebody
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:07.000]  comes to you and tells you that this is
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:10.040]  this is your last chance to do something today you have to buy this i'm going to
[03:14:10.040 --> 03:14:13.640]  make you this deal on this car but it's only for today
[03:14:13.640 --> 03:14:16.360]  that price is going to be gone tomorrow you know when somebody starts doing a
[03:14:16.360 --> 03:14:19.640]  hard sell on you at the used car sales place and they say
[03:14:19.640 --> 03:14:23.000]  this is it you know this is the only thing you're going to get
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:27.640]  you ought to be skeptical okay and we've heard this time and time again you know
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:30.760]  right now along with this article from the new
[03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:34.840]  american they say climate alarmists are demanding wartime austerity rationing
[03:14:34.840 --> 03:14:39.960]  and control they're pushing this creating a crisis because they want to usher
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:45.720]  in a global governing mechanism a mechanism that will transfer wealth
[03:14:45.720 --> 03:14:49.560]  to the one percent of the one percent of the one percent
[03:14:49.560 --> 03:14:54.280]  and will transfer our sovereignty to a multinational
[03:14:54.280 --> 03:14:57.240]  governance committee the same thing that we're concerned about people who
[03:14:57.240 --> 03:14:59.960]  understand what's going on with the trans-pacific partnership
[03:14:59.960 --> 03:15:03.160]  same mechanism they're destroying the borders
[03:15:03.160 --> 03:15:07.880]  the the different countries cultures at the same time they're offering us new
[03:15:07.880 --> 03:15:11.560]  structures to take the place but again it's always this this is your last
[03:15:11.560 --> 03:15:15.640]  chance to do this this is a great article from mark morano climate depot
[03:15:15.640 --> 03:15:19.080]  a couple days ago uh i was linked on the drudge report every
[03:15:19.080 --> 03:15:22.760]  you in climate summit is hailed as a quote last chance to stop global
[03:15:22.760 --> 03:15:26.440]  warming before it's too late you know this may be our last chance to stop
[03:15:26.440 --> 03:15:30.440]  global governance before it's too late we have to wake up to what's going on with
[03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:34.680]  us and again he points out that paris uh they're saying the next climate
[03:15:34.680 --> 03:15:37.720]  summit in paris which is going to be november 30th
[03:15:37.720 --> 03:15:40.600]  through december 13th if i remember the dates correctly
[03:15:40.600 --> 03:15:44.600]  maybe the last effective opportunity well he goes back and he says hey we had a
[03:15:44.600 --> 03:15:48.440]  last chance in bond in 2001 we had another last
[03:15:48.440 --> 03:15:53.240]  chance in montreal in 2005 another one in bali in 2007 they
[03:15:53.240 --> 03:15:57.720]  said bali could be the last chance to avoid the worst effects of global
[03:15:57.720 --> 03:16:02.120]  warming also in 2007 about that same conference he had philip clapp
[03:16:02.120 --> 03:16:05.480]  head of the washington based national environmental trust said
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:09.400]  the scientists are telling us this is the world's last shot at avoiding the
[03:16:09.400 --> 03:16:14.520]  worst consequences of global warming another last shot in poland in 2008
[03:16:14.520 --> 03:16:18.760]  the world will suicide if it cannot strike a strong climate pack said
[03:16:18.760 --> 03:16:22.360]  professor flannery 2008 humanity is approaching the last
[03:16:22.360 --> 03:16:25.160]  chance to prevent catastrophic climate change
[03:16:25.160 --> 03:16:29.800]  another last chance that we missed in kopenhagen in 2009
[03:16:29.800 --> 03:16:34.520]  the world faces a final opportunity to agree to an adequate global response to
[03:16:34.520 --> 03:16:37.720]  climate change in a un-led meeting in kopenhagen to december so
[03:16:37.720 --> 03:16:41.320]  and we're also told that by the un secretary general bonki moon was
[03:16:41.320 --> 03:16:44.200]  preaching of catastrophic consequences if that was
[03:16:44.200 --> 03:16:48.040]  missed that last chance so we had another last chance in 2010 in cancun and
[03:16:48.040 --> 03:16:53.400]  another last chance in durban 2011 and now we got our last chance coming up
[03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:57.400]  really you know part of it is as we've talked about the
[03:16:57.400 --> 03:17:03.080]  recent nasa data talking about the Antarctic ice caps and they said yeah
[03:17:03.080 --> 03:17:08.680]  we've had record melting in the Antarctic okay but they've had a net
[03:17:08.680 --> 03:17:13.480]  increase in ice because there's so much ice down the Antarctic
[03:17:13.480 --> 03:17:17.880]  and they's the people still pushed back against nasa said no you're looking what
[03:17:17.880 --> 03:17:21.480]  you're looking at is not technically ice it's snow
[03:17:21.480 --> 03:17:25.240]  they said no there hasn't been we can look at our weather records there hasn't
[03:17:25.240 --> 03:17:29.480]  been any much snow down there that is ice build up
[03:17:29.480 --> 03:17:32.760]  so you see you can go back and forth you can look at the data and it's how do you
[03:17:32.760 --> 03:17:35.880]  interpret the data and the data needs to be constantly
[03:17:35.880 --> 03:17:40.200]  reevaluated reinterpreted with these models need to be tested
[03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:43.160]  in the ways that we can test them and of course some of the tests that we've seen
[03:17:43.160 --> 03:17:49.720]  you know we were told back in the 1970s I've got the time magazine
[03:17:49.720 --> 03:17:53.320]  articles telling us that we were going to be going into global cooling we were
[03:17:53.320 --> 03:17:56.680]  going to run out of oil at the time and of course
[03:17:56.680 --> 03:18:00.200]  we should have had the according to algor and his inconvenient truths that he
[03:18:00.200 --> 03:18:04.360]  was telling us we weren't going to have an Antarctic or an Arctic
[03:18:04.360 --> 03:18:09.720]  ice cap they were going to be gone by now because we had missed our last chances
[03:18:09.720 --> 03:18:13.880]  and now we're being told by some scientists that there is a
[03:18:13.880 --> 03:18:17.480]  cycle coming from the sun it's going to go into hibernation mode and we are
[03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:21.320]  going to see a cooling effect and when it's activity
[03:18:21.320 --> 03:18:25.320]  which is not constant folks it cycles and they can see this
[03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:28.280]  cycling that's going on they say we're going to enter a hibernation mode around
[03:18:28.280 --> 03:18:32.440]  2030 when that happens it's not going to only be a cooling
[03:18:32.440 --> 03:18:35.800]  effect of less energy coming from the sun they point out a dim
[03:18:35.800 --> 03:18:40.920]  sun doesn't deflect cosmic rays away from the earth as efficiently as a bright
[03:18:40.920 --> 03:18:45.480]  sun so when these rays will enter our atmosphere they will seed clouds which
[03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:49.480]  will in turn cool our planet even more and increase precipitation
[03:18:49.480 --> 03:18:53.480]  in the form of rain snow and hail nevertheless
[03:18:53.480 --> 03:18:57.240]  algor algor is very optimistic that they're going to ram
[03:18:57.240 --> 03:19:01.800]  this thing through let's play a clip of what he has to say about this
[03:19:01.800 --> 03:19:06.600]  the impact of climate related extreme weather events
[03:19:06.600 --> 03:19:11.080]  is now driving home the reality of the climate crisis
[03:19:11.080 --> 03:19:14.520]  in a way that scientific predictions
[03:19:14.520 --> 03:19:19.240]  did not every night on the television news is like a nature hike through the
[03:19:19.240 --> 03:19:22.760]  book of revelation the number of extremely hot days has
[03:19:22.760 --> 03:19:27.080]  multiplied dramatically we have floods we don't have floods floods mud
[03:19:27.080 --> 03:19:31.240]  slides the deeper and longer droughts rising
[03:19:31.240 --> 03:19:35.160]  sea levels from the melting ice forest fires
[03:19:35.160 --> 03:19:39.480]  and increasingly people are connecting those dots
[03:19:39.480 --> 03:19:45.000]  and even if they don't use the phrase climate crisis or global warming
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  more and more people are feeling that this is going to have to be addressed
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:53.240]  so damage has been done and we have to understand let's let's stop this you
[03:19:53.240 --> 03:19:55.000]  know that that's what we see every time you know
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:58.440]  each side will say hey it's snowing it's cold or it's warm so that
[03:19:58.440 --> 03:20:01.800]  preserves it is much more complicated two of our top priorities are providing

[03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:21.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show i'm David Knight your host i wonder what
[03:24:21.160 --> 03:24:25.720]  smoking the band would have to say about google car traveling at 24 miles an
[03:24:25.720 --> 03:24:29.880]  hour and a 35 mile an hour zone that was an article we had the beginning of the
[03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:33.960]  show uh finally uh one of these things over and
[03:24:33.960 --> 03:24:36.600]  gave him a ticket and i guess the question is who gets the ticket does
[03:24:36.600 --> 03:24:39.480]  google get the ticket or the passenger because you know there's no
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:42.920]  steering wheel no pedal in that you have absolutely no control and you're an
[03:24:42.920 --> 03:24:48.120]  idiot if you put yourself under the control of some machine like that
[03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:51.480]  my opinion uh let's we're going to go back to your calls here
[03:24:51.480 --> 03:24:54.680]  i before we do i want to let you know about two specials that we got
[03:24:54.680 --> 03:24:58.360]  just for this weekend we got winter sun vitamin d3 20 off just
[03:24:58.360 --> 03:25:01.800]  through the end of this weekend and we have a new product
[03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:05.560]  living defense so we're expected to sell out this week but you can find that now
[03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:11.720]  at info wars life dot com and before we go to our calls this one story i'd be
[03:25:11.720 --> 03:25:15.720]  remiss if i didn't mention this this is from anti war dot com they point out
[03:25:15.720 --> 03:25:18.920]  interviewed on cnn today retired general john alan
[03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:22.440]  recently replaced at the u.s special envoy to the war against isis offered
[03:25:22.440 --> 03:25:26.280]  an extremely pessimistic assessment of the war saying the u.s needs to
[03:25:26.280 --> 03:25:30.200]  address the causes of symptoms like isis and al-qaeda
[03:25:30.200 --> 03:25:33.480]  and failing that we will be condemned to fight
[03:25:33.480 --> 03:25:40.600]  forever yes i agree with him now i think we might uh disagree as to what the
[03:25:40.600 --> 03:25:44.520]  cause is i think the cause is fundamentally the military
[03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:48.120]  industrial complex and the cia that has been
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:52.920]  arming equipping and training and using these jihadi islamic terrorists as
[03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:57.480]  their surrogates unless we expose that and understand that we will be
[03:25:57.480 --> 03:26:03.560]  condemned to fight forever just like sisyphus we will be running
[03:26:03.560 --> 03:26:08.120]  this empire and pushing this rock up the hill endlessly and letting it roll
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:11.800]  down again roll down and crush us underneath it
[03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:15.160]  and then have somebody else in our culture our family
[03:26:15.160 --> 03:26:18.760]  have to push that rock up again the hill i mean this is
[03:26:18.760 --> 03:26:23.560]  this is the kind of punishment that we've been condemned to not by some
[03:26:23.560 --> 03:26:27.960]  mythological greek gods but by the military industrial complex that isan
[03:26:27.960 --> 03:26:31.320]  howard warned us about yes we are condemned to fight forever
[03:26:31.320 --> 03:26:35.080]  until we unless we wake up and understand what the cause
[03:26:35.080 --> 03:26:39.000]  of these wars are who these people are where they came from and the fact that
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:43.000]  they are our creation creations are surrogates
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:49.480]  let's go to emma in kentucky you had a comment about climate control go ahead
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:54.280]  emma from kentucky issue there i guess you okay she's not there
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:26:59.560]  all right let's go to uh james and ohio james pc culture
[03:26:59.560 --> 03:27:07.160]  hi hello hello yes go ahead james and ohio go ahead as far as the
[03:27:07.160 --> 03:27:12.600]  situation with the borders in the united states and europe
[03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:16.040]  this is an old Stalinist tactic he would have
[03:27:16.040 --> 03:27:22.520]  a population picked up wholesale and sit down in an area where the cultures the
[03:27:22.520 --> 03:27:27.000]  religions the heritage was as disparate as possible
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:30.920]  and you're exactly right exactly right in a very short time
[03:27:30.920 --> 03:27:35.800]  uh the culture heritage religion of each would be destroyed
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:39.800]  and the state could step in to replace all of that
[03:27:39.800 --> 03:27:42.920]  and that's what you're trying to do now the tactics
[03:27:42.920 --> 03:27:46.520]  differ as to how the migrants are created
[03:27:46.520 --> 03:27:51.880]  in mexico it was the uh
[03:27:51.880 --> 03:27:57.800]  rockefeller's green revolution that ruined their agricultural industry and
[03:27:57.800 --> 03:28:03.000]  drove them north but now they have the uh the wars of course
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:06.280]  yes you're exactly right and of course we we've been saying that type of thing
[03:28:06.280 --> 03:28:09.240]  you're you're right to point that out that it was communists have successfully
[03:28:09.240 --> 03:28:12.840]  used that tactic and of course the prime prime minister of
[03:28:12.840 --> 03:28:16.280]  hungry uh orban has pointed this out and specifically
[03:28:16.280 --> 03:28:20.920]  singling out uh george soros orban criticized him and this is an
[03:28:20.920 --> 03:28:23.640]  article from the new american criticized him as being a dark
[03:28:23.640 --> 03:28:28.760]  hand behind the migrant influx soros replied the prime minister's plan
[03:28:28.760 --> 03:28:32.280]  treats the protection of national borders as the objective i mean who would
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:35.560]  think that a prime minister would care that his
[03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:40.040]  border has nations okay and he says in the refugees are an obstacle to that
[03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:44.120]  he says on the other hand he says the plan he says my plan
[03:28:44.120 --> 03:28:48.200]  treats the protection of refugees as the objective and the national borders as
[03:28:48.200 --> 03:28:51.400]  the obstacle so first of all soros admits
[03:28:51.400 --> 03:28:56.040]  that he wants to get rid of national borders there's the obstacle he says to
[03:28:56.040 --> 03:29:00.280]  helping refugees okay but understand that that is
[03:29:00.280 --> 03:29:04.440]  not his objective his objective is global governance just as james just
[03:29:04.440 --> 03:29:07.720]  pointed out and it is the refugees that are the means
[03:29:07.720 --> 03:29:10.920]  of achieving that and the prime minister of hungry said
[03:29:10.920 --> 03:29:15.800]  by whom and on what authority were the european leaders tasked with not only
[03:29:15.800 --> 03:29:19.960]  admitting but transporting to european continent hundreds of thousands of
[03:29:19.960 --> 03:29:22.200]  people from groups outside of european culture
[03:29:22.200 --> 03:29:25.800]  so that little by little european cultural identity would be called into
[03:29:25.800 --> 03:29:28.440]  question exactly right i want to get your comments on
[03:29:28.440 --> 03:29:31.480]  that uh james and ohio when we come back we'll take some more calls we'll be
[03:29:31.480 --> 03:29:44.360]  right back
[03:29:47.960 --> 03:29:51.800]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:51.800 --> 03:29:59.880]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:59.880 --> 03:30:02.840]  new report expects a million cancer deaths
[03:30:02.840 --> 03:30:06.520]  from fukushima fallout under estimated and
[03:30:06.520 --> 03:30:12.200]  under reported article up at info wars dot com by christian serik
[03:30:12.200 --> 03:30:17.880]  in a new report published by fair winds energy education or fe
[03:30:17.880 --> 03:30:21.400]  cancer is on the rise in post fukushima japan
[03:30:21.400 --> 03:30:25.240]  we learned that the ongoing multicore nuclear meltdown
[03:30:25.240 --> 03:30:30.760]  at the fukushima plant has produced approximately 230 times higher than
[03:30:30.760 --> 03:30:37.000]  normal thyroid cancers in fukushima prefecture and could result in as many
[03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:40.680]  as one million more cancers due to the incident
[03:30:40.680 --> 03:30:44.760]  that happened in march of 2011 five years later
[03:30:44.760 --> 03:30:49.480]  and we are still getting a grip on how catastrophic fukushima truly was to this
[03:30:49.480 --> 03:30:54.520]  planet and its people you can read more about this at info wars

[03:33:10.920 --> 03:33:14.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host and we're taking
[03:33:14.440 --> 03:33:19.240]  your calls we were talking to james in ohio and he pointed out that the
[03:33:19.240 --> 03:33:24.440]  process by which they are bringing in immigrants in europe and taking down the
[03:33:24.440 --> 03:33:27.400]  culture they're taking down the national borders and they admit that now
[03:33:27.400 --> 03:33:31.640]  we've had george soros talking about how national borders are an obstacle
[03:33:31.640 --> 03:33:35.720]  needs to be taken away so that he can help refugees well are they really
[03:33:35.720 --> 03:33:39.240]  refugees we'll talk about that in a moment but of course
[03:33:39.240 --> 03:33:42.520]  we've had other globalists talking about how national borders
[03:33:42.520 --> 03:33:47.160]  are an anachronism how they're a shibboleth how they are something from the
[03:33:47.160 --> 03:33:49.480]  past and they're going to get rid of it they're
[03:33:49.480 --> 03:33:53.560]  openly talking about this this is not a conspiracy theory
[03:33:53.560 --> 03:33:57.480]  it is a conspiracy it's not a theory it's an open conspiracy
[03:33:57.480 --> 03:34:01.320]  to do this i want to go back and get james comments on this because he'd
[03:34:01.320 --> 03:34:03.960]  point out this is something that's been done successfully and
[03:34:03.960 --> 03:34:08.600]  and been done often by communists james your comments on what the
[03:34:08.600 --> 03:34:13.640]  hungarian prime minister is saying well the difference between stalling's
[03:34:13.640 --> 03:34:18.600]  time and now is that we have the experience with stalling to go on
[03:34:18.600 --> 03:34:24.280]  and people are self-educated in political realities
[03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:29.320]  and mass and they're educated outside of these indoctrination centers they
[03:34:29.320 --> 03:34:35.640]  call colleges and universities and we have the internet so
[03:34:35.640 --> 03:34:38.840]  information can traverse the globe in seconds
[03:34:38.840 --> 03:34:42.920]  in an audio visual form that's easy to understand so
[03:34:42.920 --> 03:34:46.600]  i think they're accelerating their schedule yes which
[03:34:46.600 --> 03:34:50.760]  might be an opportunity for us to win because as i've heard
[03:34:50.760 --> 03:34:54.920]  the swift strike often misses yes yes exactly
[03:34:54.920 --> 03:34:57.480]  hey you know i think there's some parallels to be drawn you we're talking
[03:34:57.480 --> 03:35:00.440]  in earlier in the program about the people who are wringing their hands and
[03:35:00.440 --> 03:35:04.040]  saying this is the demise of hard news we're going to go to opinion
[03:35:04.040 --> 03:35:07.320]  journalism of course those are not opinions just divorced
[03:35:07.320 --> 03:35:10.600]  from the facts if the opinions are completely divorced from facts and
[03:35:10.600 --> 03:35:13.960]  they're obviously worthless but one of the things that we're talking about was
[03:35:13.960 --> 03:35:16.840]  well everybody's expressing their opinion on the internet everybody's
[03:35:16.840 --> 03:35:20.520]  exchanging ideas on the internet i think we are because of the internet
[03:35:20.520 --> 03:35:23.800]  because of that ability to communicate back and forth of people just like you
[03:35:23.800 --> 03:35:29.560]  said james we are at a kind of position in
[03:35:29.560 --> 03:35:33.960]  history similar to what immediately preceded
[03:35:33.960 --> 03:35:38.360]  the revolution in america and they hark back and say yeah we
[03:35:38.360 --> 03:35:42.680]  haven't seen this kind of opinion journalism for a couple hundred years
[03:35:42.680 --> 03:35:47.400]  now and of course what was driving that was the access to books you know first
[03:35:47.400 --> 03:35:50.440]  you had the printing press and it took a couple hundred years for that to
[03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:53.720]  get to the point where people really had access to information
[03:35:53.720 --> 03:35:56.760]  and that really started changing things when people could start reading things
[03:35:56.760 --> 03:36:00.600]  for themselves when they weren't being force-fed by the authorities and told
[03:36:00.600 --> 03:36:04.200]  what to believe and given a homogenous situation but they
[03:36:04.200 --> 03:36:06.760]  could go out there and do their own research and read in a way that they'd
[03:36:06.760 --> 03:36:10.920]  never done before because of the printing press that really
[03:36:10.920 --> 03:36:13.400]  changed things and i think we're seeing that again
[03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:17.240]  with the internet as well thank you james i want to go to
[03:36:17.240 --> 03:36:21.720]  gene in minnesota in just a moment but i want to point out one other thing that
[03:36:21.720 --> 03:36:24.360]  the hungarian prime minister was talking about and
[03:36:24.360 --> 03:36:27.720]  that's in this article in the new american of course
[03:36:27.720 --> 03:36:31.560]  you know george soros and the multinational globalists have their own
[03:36:31.560 --> 03:36:34.840]  agenda but and the people that they're bringing in have their own agenda as
[03:36:34.840 --> 03:36:39.240]  well primarily in europe it's migrants from the
[03:36:39.240 --> 03:36:43.240]  middle east as well as from africa well what are the middle easterners agenda
[03:36:43.240 --> 03:36:46.440]  well they have a jordanian opposition leader dr
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:52.200]  dr mudar zaran himself a muslim asylum seeker currently living in the u k he
[03:36:52.200 --> 03:36:55.880]  warned last month that muslim migrants are not what they appear to be
[03:36:55.880 --> 03:36:58.680]  he said they should be kept out of europe they're not part of the is because
[03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:01.480]  they are part of the islamic conquest of the west
[03:37:01.480 --> 03:37:06.360]  he says europeans are being played for fools he said read the arab magazines the
[03:37:06.360 --> 03:37:10.520]  arab newspapers they're talking about good job now we're going to conquer
[03:37:10.520 --> 03:37:14.120]  now we're going to conquer europe he says it's not even a secret
[03:37:14.120 --> 03:37:18.360]  and of course others are pointing out michelle hickford says this is actually
[03:37:18.360 --> 03:37:21.800]  an ancient strategy uh james of ohio was just talking about how the
[03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:25.880]  communists would use a strategy that the globalists are doing right now bringing
[03:37:25.880 --> 03:37:29.320]  in disparate populations but of course those populations have their own
[03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:32.920]  motivations and george soros and company are well aware of that
[03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:37.000]  and she said this is actually an ancient strategy on the islamic side as well
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:39.320]  straight from the islamic playbook called the
[03:37:39.320 --> 03:37:43.240]  he's right if i'm pronouncing that correctly or a migration or a journey she
[03:37:43.240 --> 03:37:47.880]  says it's the most effective method of jihad it requires no military no wars
[03:37:47.880 --> 03:37:51.800]  but it's nevertheless an invasion and i was reminded of what bobby jendall who's
[03:37:51.800 --> 03:37:55.640]  running uh said about immigration he said immigration
[03:37:55.640 --> 03:37:59.720]  without assimilation is invasion because when you go into a country and you
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:03.000]  say i have absolutely no respect for your laws your traditions your cultures
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:06.520]  your language i'm not going to conform to anything that you have to say here
[03:38:06.520 --> 03:38:10.200]  but i'm going to demand that you give me this this and this
[03:38:10.200 --> 03:38:14.280]  that is a hostile invasion now let's look at the other side of this let's look
[03:38:14.280 --> 03:38:18.440]  at the african side of this and of course they've got a
[03:38:18.440 --> 03:38:24.440]  conference going on right now in malta this week happened 60 european leaders
[03:38:24.440 --> 03:38:28.360]  and and african leaders a meeting in the malty's capital
[03:38:28.360 --> 03:38:31.960]  and what they offered them was two billion dollars
[03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:35.640]  to the african nations to take back these migrants who don't qualify for
[03:38:35.640 --> 03:38:38.600]  asylum in other words they know that they're there strictly for economic
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:41.000]  reasons this is a story that was on info wars.com
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:45.080]  yesterday from curtain memo he says however the african nations refused it
[03:38:45.080 --> 03:38:48.440]  and here's why they refused it they currently get
[03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:51.800]  20 billion dollars of aid from the europeans and so the europeans that will
[03:38:51.800 --> 03:38:54.920]  give you another 10 we'll give you another two billion dollars if you'll
[03:38:54.920 --> 03:38:58.760]  take these refugees these migrants they're not refugees these migrants
[03:38:58.760 --> 03:39:02.040]  who've come here for economic reasons if you'll take them back because we can't
[03:39:02.040 --> 03:39:04.440]  assimilate them they don't want to be assimilated
[03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:07.640]  we're unable to assimilate for whatever reason okay we'll give you two billion
[03:39:07.640 --> 03:39:11.400]  dollars to deal with the cost of bringing them back they said no
[03:39:11.400 --> 03:39:15.000]  they said the biggest concern and this is what kurt wrote the biggest concern
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:18.600]  is return of illegal immigrants putting an end to
[03:39:18.600 --> 03:39:22.360]  remittance the sending of money by migrants to relatives in africa so they
[03:39:22.360 --> 03:39:26.440]  estimate that at being slightly over 11 billion dollars a year
[03:39:26.440 --> 03:39:29.800]  i say sending back economic migrants will put considerable pressure on the
[03:39:29.800 --> 03:39:33.480]  country of origin because if these people go back wages
[03:39:33.480 --> 03:39:37.880]  will drop by 90 percent set a lead economist with a world bank
[03:39:37.880 --> 03:39:42.040]  so in other words 90 of their economy is coming from people sending money back
[03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:46.040]  home and that's 11 billion dollars so how do you deal with that
[03:39:46.040 --> 03:39:49.160]  i mean do you let yourself be taken hostage by that when you
[03:39:49.160 --> 03:39:52.760]  they know that this is they're admitting that they're not refugees
[03:39:52.760 --> 03:39:56.200]  see that's not a humanitarian operation like george solis wants to pretend
[03:39:56.200 --> 03:39:59.640]  this is an economic takeover for the people coming from africa
[03:39:59.640 --> 03:40:02.760]  it is a religious and cultural takeover for the people that are coming from the
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:05.400]  middle east and we need to wake up and call it
[03:40:05.400 --> 03:40:09.000]  what it is and understand what is being done and people are waking up in europe
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:11.560]  they are understanding that and the way you deal with this is you say okay we're
[03:40:11.560 --> 03:40:14.760]  giving you 20 billion dollars we'll raise it to 22
[03:40:14.760 --> 03:40:19.800]  uh or we will take it to zero if you're not going to take these people back
[03:40:19.800 --> 03:40:22.200]  that 11 billion dollars that you're getting right now
[03:40:22.200 --> 03:40:25.240]  we're going to keep that that's the way you deal with people you deal from
[03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:29.320]  with that with a position of strength i think let's go to gene in minnesota gene
[03:40:29.320 --> 03:40:32.840]  you want to talk about political correctness yes
[03:40:32.840 --> 03:40:39.480]  go ahead um i have been tracing this as joe big said
[03:40:39.480 --> 03:40:45.400]  the pcp the pansies um which i like that was that was great
[03:40:45.400 --> 03:40:49.640]  back now as far as i know as a parent
[03:40:49.640 --> 03:40:54.680]  and as also a holder of two degrees that i helped pay for
[03:40:54.680 --> 03:41:02.440]  um one of the first 10 words a toddler learns
[03:41:02.440 --> 03:41:08.440]  is why why when did this disappear was it
[03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:11.880]  but the parents are too lazy to spend the time
[03:41:11.880 --> 03:41:16.440]  with their children to explore different ideas
[03:41:16.440 --> 03:41:21.160]  is it the nanny state high schools we're sending them to
[03:41:21.160 --> 03:41:25.400]  that's what i think it is yeah go ahead mm-hmm i think it's a school
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:30.280]  idea and then they get to college and they have
[03:41:30.280 --> 03:41:36.840]  no idea to ask why for anything i'm 52 years old and i'm still
[03:41:36.840 --> 03:41:42.120]  asking why yes and when did that get out of the lexicon
[03:41:42.120 --> 03:41:46.120]  of our children well you know i i if you want my opinion
[03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:51.000]  i think it is uh it is drilled into people k through 12 and also in
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:54.440]  college that you listen to people in authority we're in
[03:41:54.440 --> 03:41:56.680]  authority we're standing at the front of the classroom we're going to tell you
[03:41:56.680 --> 03:41:59.800]  what to think we're going to tell you about this issue or that issue
[03:41:59.800 --> 03:42:03.480]  you're going to buy into this consist consensus or you're going to be
[03:42:03.480 --> 03:42:07.400]  ostracized because of it and i think it comes from that i think they do that
[03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:10.680]  we saw that happen with the news i mean when we had the supposed
[03:42:10.680 --> 03:42:15.640]  hard news where there was only uh you're old enough you remember when we had
[03:42:15.640 --> 03:42:18.920]  just three news networks and they pretty much
[03:42:18.920 --> 03:42:21.720]  said exactly the same thing because they're all reading from the government
[03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:25.800]  script and so nobody questions them because you know Walter Cronkite and
[03:42:25.800 --> 03:42:28.920]  he's an authority and david brinkley the huntley brinkley report i mean they're
[03:42:28.920 --> 03:42:31.560]  the authorities we listen to them we do what they say they're all saying
[03:42:31.560 --> 03:42:34.120]  essentially the same thing covering the same stories
[03:42:34.120 --> 03:42:38.040]  covering them saying the same things about all the same stories and
[03:42:38.040 --> 03:42:41.080]  that is what has started to unravel for these people with the freedom of the
[03:42:41.080 --> 03:42:45.080]  internet and they really don't like that
[03:42:45.080 --> 03:42:48.520]  it still goes back to the parents my father was
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:52.920]  a lawyer for 54 years and he would encourage me
[03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:59.480]  to find out what my ideas were or let me ask the question why
[03:42:59.480 --> 03:43:03.160]  and if he had an answer that wasn't complete enough i'd say why
[03:43:03.160 --> 03:43:07.160]  again and we had many dining room table
[03:43:07.160 --> 03:43:11.160]  debates over things well certainly and that was the that was the whole point
[03:43:11.160 --> 03:43:15.640]  of a liberal education was to liberate you to do your own
[03:43:15.640 --> 03:43:19.880]  inquiry to investigate yourself you know to investigate the facts yourself to
[03:43:19.880 --> 03:43:23.240]  have the tools of learning so that you could make your own decisions as an
[03:43:23.240 --> 03:43:27.560]  intelligent uh thinking person rather than just parroting back
[03:43:27.560 --> 03:43:31.080]  the standard consensus that's being fed to you
[03:43:31.080 --> 03:43:35.320]  yes thank you so much uh let's go to paul in new jersey paul you want to talk
[03:43:35.320 --> 03:43:37.880]  about political correctness as well go ahead
[03:43:37.880 --> 03:43:43.480]  okay well people don't realize we've been taking over a long time ago
[03:43:43.480 --> 03:43:49.160]  right from the get-go uh the constitution was set aside
[03:43:49.160 --> 03:43:55.880]  in 1933 after the bankruptcy and 1913 we became communists we were
[03:43:55.880 --> 03:43:58.600]  communists before the communists were we're still operating under the
[03:43:58.600 --> 03:44:02.280]  communist manifesto if you don't believe me look all
[03:44:02.280 --> 03:44:07.400]  these uh so-called agencies and everything oh yeah i think we had in
[03:44:07.400 --> 03:44:12.280]  1776 who were harassed by all these public agencies and
[03:44:12.280 --> 03:44:16.120]  taxes and this and that i say it this way we're being
[03:44:16.120 --> 03:44:19.880]  radiated chemicalized plasticized and psychologicalized
[03:44:19.880 --> 03:44:26.120]  and this is a land of the free fee yes yes exactly regulations as well as other
[03:44:26.120 --> 03:44:29.800]  stuff home with a slave home of the slave exactly and you
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:36.200]  know i think a good example of that is the war on drugs you know the prior
[03:44:36.200 --> 03:44:39.720]  you know they're when they did the uh volstead amendment
[03:44:39.720 --> 03:44:42.520]  when they amended the constitution said we're going to prohibit alcohol they
[03:44:42.520 --> 03:44:45.320]  knew that they had no authority to do that but they had enough respect for the
[03:44:45.320 --> 03:44:49.480]  constitution to do that but then after they repealed alcohol
[03:44:49.480 --> 03:44:52.120]  prohibition they just said we're going to prohibit whatever we want they don't
[03:44:52.120 --> 03:44:56.120]  even pretend to obey the constitution whether it's that or whether
[03:44:56.120 --> 03:44:59.160]  it's we can go to any number of issues i mean just look at what they're doing
[03:44:59.160 --> 03:45:03.240]  at the airport so the tsa uh they clearly don't care
[03:45:03.240 --> 03:45:06.600]  uh to even pretend that they're going to get search warrants that they're going
[03:45:06.600 --> 03:45:10.280]  to have due process they don't even pretend to care they're going to give us
[03:45:10.280 --> 03:45:13.880]  a trial and accuse us of uh some wrongdoing before they're going to
[03:45:13.880 --> 03:45:17.320]  confiscate our property no they use civil asset forfeiture and just take
[03:45:17.320 --> 03:45:20.680]  your car without even accusing you of crime let alone finding you
[03:45:20.680 --> 03:45:25.320]  guilty so yeah they don't even make a pretense of obeying the constitution
[03:45:25.320 --> 03:45:31.160]  anymore thank you uh paul let's go to uh robert and alabama robert
[03:45:31.160 --> 03:45:39.960]  yes um i live in alabama and i have seen this high school i used to go to
[03:45:39.960 --> 03:45:44.120]  has been the runway has been extended
[03:45:44.120 --> 03:45:48.680]  they turned it into a runway it's been extended
[03:45:48.680 --> 03:46:01.400]  i live on top of the hill and i have seen jets i have seen huge huge military
[03:46:01.400 --> 03:46:05.960]  aircraft i've seen them unloading things like
[03:46:05.960 --> 03:46:14.040]  m-wraps i've seen them unloading what looks to be ammo
[03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:21.240]  i have seen them basically being real sketchy
[03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:29.240]  and i want to know if you think this is signs of what to come
[03:46:29.240 --> 03:46:32.680]  well absolutely this this is not anything that's new that we don't you know
[03:46:32.680 --> 03:46:37.240]  this the principles have always been there we were warned by madison he said
[03:46:37.240 --> 03:46:40.600]  the means of defense abroad have always become the instruments of tyranny at
[03:46:40.600 --> 03:46:43.640]  home that's why they didn't want to see a standing army
[03:46:43.640 --> 03:46:47.400]  we have had a standing army now since world war two and we've had continuous
[03:46:47.400 --> 03:46:51.160]  wars since world war two just as this general is saying
[03:46:51.160 --> 03:46:55.080]  general john allen who's retired he says if we don't understand the cause of this
[03:46:55.080 --> 03:46:58.200]  stuff uh we're going to be condemned to fight forever
[03:46:58.200 --> 03:47:02.360]  that's precisely the point that's what a standing army what a military industrial
[03:47:02.360 --> 03:47:05.480]  complex wants to do it wants the country to be in a state of
[03:47:05.480 --> 03:47:08.760]  continual war because it makes money for them
[03:47:08.760 --> 03:47:12.200]  it keeps them in power and if we don't understand that
[03:47:12.200 --> 03:47:16.200]  this standing army is going to be standing on our throats and we see this
[03:47:16.200 --> 03:47:19.880]  increasingly that the government is militarizing the police
[03:47:19.880 --> 03:47:23.720]  and they're using the the military as police
[03:47:23.720 --> 03:47:28.360]  they're they're converging all of this under the control of
[03:47:28.360 --> 03:47:31.960]  the president and i think it's very interesting that nobody called into
[03:47:31.960 --> 03:47:35.240]  question what chris christie said on veterans day
[03:47:35.240 --> 03:47:39.400]  saying that uh hillary disrespects our veterans
[03:47:39.400 --> 03:47:45.960]  on the va and obama disrespects our law enforcement officers in uniform so he
[03:47:45.960 --> 03:47:49.720]  doesn't have the moral authority to command them or whatever okay
[03:47:49.720 --> 03:47:53.560]  in other words he's saying that the military that the that law enforcement
[03:47:53.560 --> 03:47:56.920]  is in uniform like some kind of you know paramilitary thing and certainly
[03:47:56.920 --> 03:47:59.800]  that's what we see i mean look at the pictures
[03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:03.880]  they they're indistinguishable as we have been told multiple times i
[03:48:03.880 --> 03:48:07.720]  remember in new hampshire when they were that small town that was pushing back
[03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:10.760]  against the mraps and there was a retired marine colonel there and he says
[03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:13.880]  you guys are better equipped than we were in felucia
[03:48:13.880 --> 03:48:18.280]  it is clearly militarized it is being consolidated and a single source
[03:48:18.280 --> 03:48:21.880]  and chris christie is just fine with that and so
[03:48:21.880 --> 03:48:25.720]  is everybody else because nobody is even pointing out that he made that
[03:48:25.720 --> 03:48:29.720]  that comment and of course this is another guy who could care less
[03:48:29.720 --> 03:48:33.480]  what the constitution says conservatives need to understand
[03:48:33.480 --> 03:48:37.240]  that on a variety of issues i mean whether it's uh you know they get people
[03:48:37.240 --> 03:48:40.840]  afraid they want law enforcement they want to be
[03:48:40.840 --> 03:48:44.520]  they want to feel as if they're safe and that sense of security
[03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:49.000]  that false sense of security that ideal that idolizing
[03:48:49.000 --> 03:48:52.280]  safety over everything else is going to turn you into slaves it's turning us
[03:48:52.280 --> 03:48:56.760]  into slaves step by step when you give up your liberty
[03:48:56.760 --> 03:49:01.720]  you are never safe you simply become a slave and so we see that at the airports
[03:49:01.720 --> 03:49:04.600]  we see that with the police and the way they interact with people
[03:49:04.600 --> 03:49:07.800]  that is what's happening and it's clearly a militarization and you know
[03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:12.120]  robert that we were warned about that 200 years ago and the reason they were
[03:49:12.120 --> 03:49:16.280]  able to tell us that is not because times are any
[03:49:16.280 --> 03:49:19.560]  different we know they didn't have the military tools that we have now but
[03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:24.280]  that's not the issue the issue is the hearts the minds of souls of people
[03:49:24.280 --> 03:49:28.440]  that doesn't change human nature does not change they knew what would happen
[03:49:28.440 --> 03:49:32.280]  when you consolidated power and we are seeing the fruits of that now
[03:49:32.280 --> 03:49:35.160]  so they could warn us madison could look at this they say this is
[03:49:35.160 --> 03:49:38.120]  this is a pattern that's been repeated through history why because human nature
[03:49:38.120 --> 03:49:41.240]  doesn't change and it doesn't matter if they're doing it with bows and arrows
[03:49:41.240 --> 03:49:45.480]  or if they're doing it with autonomous killing machines okay human nature
[03:49:45.480 --> 03:49:49.480]  doesn't change they're going to want to dominate the people that create
[03:49:49.480 --> 03:49:53.720]  this empire and that's what we've had really going back to the civil war we
[03:49:53.720 --> 03:49:57.000]  started creating an american empire at that point
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:50:01.800]  by consolidating power into the center anything else you want to say robert
[03:50:01.800 --> 03:50:08.120]  in special forces as well and i have also seen unloading this
[03:50:08.120 --> 03:50:15.480]  you know these things men in black military uniforms
[03:50:15.480 --> 03:50:22.520]  no name tags things like that do you think that maybe
[03:50:22.520 --> 03:50:26.040]  our next president will do something about that
[03:50:26.040 --> 03:50:30.200]  as long as it's not i don't know hillary
[03:50:30.200 --> 03:50:33.960]  oh i don't know it's hard to say and of course you know when we just saw what
[03:50:33.960 --> 03:50:37.560]  it's the nature of what we have unless we stop the standing army unless we go
[03:50:37.560 --> 03:50:40.600]  back to something like the militia but the militia is being demonized by the
[03:50:40.600 --> 03:50:43.160]  press and look at the public's attitude look at what
[03:50:43.160 --> 03:50:47.320]  happened in california they said hey they just shot off nuclear weapons so
[03:50:47.320 --> 03:50:50.120]  close to put up the entire sky but it's okay

[03:55:41.480 --> 03:55:46.120]  ahead oh hi thank you just a comment you know
[03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:48.920]  i've always grown up thinking and knowing that you know you don't appreciate
[03:55:48.920 --> 03:55:53.400]  anything you don't work for and earn so it'd be just like me giving a high
[03:55:53.400 --> 03:55:55.320]  school kid a brand new car that he didn't deserve
[03:55:55.320 --> 03:55:58.200]  he's going to trash it he's not going to take care of it it's the same thing i
[03:55:58.200 --> 03:56:00.760]  believe with their education they're just not going to really
[03:56:00.760 --> 03:56:04.120]  care you know they're just there absolutely two years don't like what
[03:56:04.120 --> 03:56:06.760]  you're doing they're going to change you know and just move around and waste
[03:56:06.760 --> 03:56:10.360]  their time i think absolutely and you know they have to look at the
[03:56:10.360 --> 03:56:12.760]  back end of this as well you know there's an article from paul joseph
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:16.600]  Watson yesterday about politicians in germany calling for compulsory labor
[03:56:16.600 --> 03:56:20.280]  they were going to make university graduates commit to a year of social
[03:56:20.280 --> 03:56:23.160]  service so the government that can give you free stuff
[03:56:23.160 --> 03:56:26.680]  at the expense of other people making other people turning other people into
[03:56:26.680 --> 03:56:31.960]  slaves to wait to labor for you they can do that in any number of ways and you
[03:56:31.960 --> 03:56:36.360]  know wane when my parents went to high school it was a big deal to graduate
[03:56:36.360 --> 03:56:40.920]  from high school you know back in the you know early part of the 20th century
[03:56:40.920 --> 03:56:44.120]  most people didn't go to high school it was kind of a new thing and it was a
[03:56:44.120 --> 03:56:48.280]  really big deal if you just got a bachelor's degree if you went to college
[03:56:48.280 --> 03:56:51.640]  and now it's become expected it's not really everybody says oh you know a
[03:56:51.640 --> 03:56:54.840]  high school degree that really isn't very valuable and it's going to be the
[03:56:54.840 --> 03:56:58.600]  same thing with a college degree if it's provided for free to everybody just like
[03:56:58.600 --> 03:57:02.920]  you're saying you get something for free you don't really value it
[03:57:02.920 --> 03:57:06.360]  yeah that's what i see happening if it if it happens and i really don't think
[03:57:06.360 --> 03:57:09.000]  it's going to but anything's possible these days
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:12.280]  yeah well if they federalize it they can do it because they will just print more
[03:57:12.280 --> 03:57:15.960]  money for it but it's another way i think the more sinister
[03:57:15.960 --> 03:57:19.560]  aspect of that is that the longer you stay in school the longer you stay out of
[03:57:19.560 --> 03:57:23.320]  the real world the more childlike and accepting of authority you become i
[03:57:23.320 --> 03:57:27.480]  think that's the real danger in it and that's why it's being pushed so hard
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:31.640]  by the socialist and by the people who are a really part of the system like
[03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:37.240]  marco rubio thank you wane let's go to de wayne in texas de wayne go ahead
[03:57:37.240 --> 03:57:44.200]  yes um um when the fordhead shooter um 24 hours before the fordhead shooter did
[03:57:44.200 --> 03:57:48.120]  his thing i told my mom they're gonna have to get this march on washington
[03:57:48.120 --> 03:57:52.200]  off the news they're gonna have to stop talking about the republican victory
[03:57:52.200 --> 03:57:58.200]  or the conservative victory in the in the in the election they had just had
[03:57:58.200 --> 03:58:02.360]  because that's all they were talking about i was like the media is dysfunctional
[03:58:02.360 --> 03:58:06.360]  they're not acting normal i said mom there will be a crazy man shooting up
[03:58:06.360 --> 03:58:10.360]  everybody that's true they come up we're out of time sorry de wayne yes true
[03:58:10.360 --> 03:58:13.240]  they have a number of ways that they can control things but of course
[03:58:13.240 --> 03:58:17.080]  unfortunately too we saw that the republican victory didn't really change
[03:58:17.080 --> 03:58:21.400]  anything because the people who control the party are indistinguishable from
[03:58:21.400 --> 03:58:24.280]  the democrats we have a single party in washington that's it for today's
[03:58:24.280 --> 03:58:37.080]  broadcast join us tonight at seven central eight p.m eastern for the nightly news
