[00:00.000 --> 00:22.120]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:22.120 --> 00:25.520]  show.
[00:25.520 --> 00:32.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, another historical global transmission. Hard to believe it's already.
[00:32.360 --> 00:38.360]  February 1, 2018 on this Thursday, global edition.
[00:38.360 --> 00:43.000]  The deep state is going into convulsions with more agencies joining some at the FBI saying
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.960]  don't release the memo. Hundreds of articles out hysterically just saying it's total
[00:48.960 --> 00:54.240]  proof. Trump's a Russian. Alex Jones is one. I mean, they're just doubling down on the
[00:54.240 --> 00:59.840]  hysteria. We have got so much for you today. And very special in studio gas that I'll tell
[00:59.840 --> 01:04.160]  you about after the break. But first, I want to go to this boil down from Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:04.160 --> 01:09.600]  It's powerful. Idiots react to Trump's state of the union. Here it is tonight. Donald Trump
[01:09.600 --> 01:13.840]  presented a self congratulatory speech without vision. He promised unity, but so did division.
[01:13.840 --> 01:17.880]  Yeah, the only divisive thing I saw last night was your angustric and face. Couldn't even
[01:17.880 --> 01:23.760]  bring yourself to half heartedly applaud a call for unity tonight. I call upon all of
[01:23.760 --> 01:31.560]  us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need
[01:31.560 --> 01:39.160]  to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.
[01:39.160 --> 01:43.480]  Trump's the one causing division. Barlux. Donald Trump is not going to be president
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.360]  of the United States. Take it to the bank. I guarantee you really don't know what you're
[01:47.360 --> 01:51.080]  talking about right now. Also, did you and Cory Booker have a bet beforehand as to who
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.240]  could look most like they've been smacked across the cheeks with a massive wet fish?
[01:55.240 --> 02:00.080]  You lot can't even applaud record low black unemployment. You're all on your phones when
[02:00.080 --> 02:05.200]  Trump's talking about caring for veterans. But Trump's creating this unity. Yeah, right.
[02:05.200 --> 02:11.520]  Joe Kennedy reacted by swallowing a tide pod. Ask not what your country can drool for you.
[02:11.520 --> 02:15.440]  This guy's reaction looked like he just caught Trump pumping his wife. But he was actually
[02:15.440 --> 02:20.960]  livid about an increase in take home pay. Chuck Schumer was so triggered it looked like he
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.240]  was being eaten from the inside out. Joe Manchin really wanted to jump on board the
[02:25.240 --> 02:30.560]  Trump train, but Schumer's death stare stopped him in his tracks. Imagine being triggered
[02:30.560 --> 02:35.720]  by the word family. Church, family, police, military, the national anthem. Trump trying
[02:35.720 --> 02:39.200]  to call on all the trunks of 1950s era nationalism. The goal of this speech appears to be to force
[02:39.200 --> 02:42.400]  the normalization of Trump on the terms of the bygone era. His supporters are nostalgical.
[02:42.400 --> 02:48.520]  You're so out of touch, you think the very bedrock principles of America are part of
[02:48.520 --> 02:53.920]  a bygone era. Imagine being triggered by the word God.
[02:53.920 --> 02:58.760]  Our motto is in God we trust. Wrong. Our motto has been e pluribus and I'm out of many one.
[02:58.760 --> 03:03.560]  But to be fair, it was a pretty big mistake on Trump's part to say that in God we trust
[03:03.560 --> 03:09.160]  is the national motto. US code 302 in God we trust is the national motto. Oh wait, he's
[03:09.160 --> 03:15.840]  a CNN analyst. Say no more. Imagine being triggered by the term USA.
[03:15.840 --> 03:20.640]  I'm a patriot and I love my country, but the way people have been chanting USA lately,
[03:20.640 --> 03:25.280]  especially in response to nationalist hate-mongering sends chills down my spine.
[03:25.280 --> 03:31.720]  Yeah, if the term USA sends chills down your spine, chances are you're not a patriot. Lewis
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.640]  Gutierrez was so butt hurt by the USA chant, he had to leave the chamber.
[03:36.640 --> 03:47.040]  He later said Trump's speech was written by the Russians, so you literally fled the
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.560]  room at the sound of USA. But Trump's the traitor, okay.
[03:52.560 --> 03:55.760]  Words leftists were upset at Trump for saying last night.
[03:55.760 --> 04:03.640]  God, church, family, USA, police, military. It's almost like they hate all of the above.
[04:03.640 --> 04:09.240]  Seriously, this dude escaped from the Stalinist dictatorship of North Korea, crawled across
[04:09.240 --> 04:13.640]  China with one hand and one leg to secure his freedom.
[04:13.640 --> 04:19.920]  A new lot have mental breakdowns when people start chanting USA. Get some frigging perspective.
[04:19.920 --> 04:25.080]  This is a new low. Pax as unemployment, illegal immigration agreed, new lows.
[04:25.080 --> 04:28.920]  People got so angry at the Washington Post they were forced to change their headline.
[04:28.920 --> 04:34.680]  Here's a reaction you didn't expect. Anti-Trump pollster Frank Luntz apologizing to Trump.
[04:34.680 --> 04:40.680]  It takes class to admit you were wrong. 75% approval, anecdotal evidence suggesting Trump
[04:40.680 --> 04:47.920]  wowed even some of his haters. Is this really a turning point for America?
[04:47.920 --> 04:48.920]  Don't bet on it.
[04:48.920 --> 04:52.800]  Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States. Take it to the bank. I
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.800]  guarantee it.
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.280]  You really don't know what you're talking about right now.
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.960]  Stay with us. The main transmission launches in T-minus 60 seconds.
[05:00.960 --> 05:06.560]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWarsLife. Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency
[05:06.560 --> 05:12.520]  and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular
[05:12.520 --> 05:18.480]  engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[05:18.480 --> 05:23.520]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100%
[05:23.520 --> 05:27.960]  efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[05:27.960 --> 05:33.080]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[05:33.080 --> 05:39.400]  these reactive oxygen species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful
[05:39.400 --> 05:44.440]  available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge
[05:44.440 --> 05:50.880]  for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect and adapt with
[05:50.880 --> 05:57.880]  Cell Force from InfoWarsLife. Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[06:20.880 --> 06:38.600]  Wow, well the first month of 2018 blasted by like we were at warp speed. Amazing. And
[06:38.600 --> 06:46.280]  we see our country in a full civil war against the globalist forces, the multinationals seeking
[06:46.280 --> 06:52.040]  to bankrupt the nation and bring us into total economic, cultural and spiritual bondage to
[06:52.040 --> 06:59.520]  establish an unelected planetary technocracy in their own words. And then you see nationalists
[06:59.520 --> 07:06.760]  popping up all over the world fighting back against it and everywhere they get controlled.
[07:06.760 --> 07:11.480]  Instantly prosperity comes back because the globalists siphon everything off. They want
[07:11.480 --> 07:17.280]  a post-industrial world where they shut down local communities, where they shut down local
[07:17.280 --> 07:25.880]  farming, where they shut down local autonomy and local diversity of industry and business
[07:25.880 --> 07:32.520]  and production and centralize it in vertical integration. And that is what is going on
[07:32.520 --> 07:43.440]  period. And as we expose globalism and its authoritarian dreams and its long swath of
[07:43.440 --> 07:56.200]  crimes, it will never succeed. But it s trying. And what does it do? It says in Catalan, Spain,
[07:56.200 --> 08:05.680]  it says in Greece, it says in Italy, it says in Reykjavik, it says in England, Scotland
[08:05.680 --> 08:13.000]  and Ireland, it says in Brazil, it says in Nigeria, it says in countries and regions
[08:13.000 --> 08:22.360]  all over the world. If you try to vote in pro-nationalist groups that are free market and who want
[08:22.360 --> 08:28.200]  to get the globalist out of the control of your nations and if you don t like China with
[08:28.200 --> 08:32.640]  all these internal tariffs against you but then you ve got tariffs set up against your
[08:32.640 --> 08:39.680]  own businesses, if you do that, we re going to say you re a Russian agent and the Russians
[08:39.680 --> 08:44.920]  have given us the lowest unemployment in 80 years in just one year. The Russians have
[08:44.920 --> 08:49.360]  given us the biggest stock market ever and the Russians have given us some of the biggest
[08:49.360 --> 08:54.840]  military spending ever and some of the greatest control of the border ever and the Russians,
[08:54.840 --> 09:01.560]  they ve just put over 80,000 extra US troops on the Russian border and moved tactical nuclear
[09:01.560 --> 09:09.840]  weapons up against themselves and they ve got Trump announcing hundreds of Russian rich
[09:09.840 --> 09:15.680]  people that they re going to call oligarchs and then the US is just going to grab their
[09:15.680 --> 09:24.640]  money. Man, that is quite a move by the Russians. It s pretty amazing and of course they say
[09:24.640 --> 09:30.480]  anybody that wants to release the memo, that s a Russian bot, no proof, no facts, doesn t
[09:30.480 --> 09:39.160]  matter. You see, they re the globalist, they re the outsiders and so they ve got to then
[09:39.160 --> 09:49.280]  say, oh, everybody that opposes us are Russian agents and if you talk to a Russian or if
[09:49.280 --> 09:55.640]  you ever traveled to Russia, if you ve got a Russian visa, you re a Russian agent and
[09:55.640 --> 10:01.600]  they re hinging everything on Donald Trump Jr. meeting with a Russian lawyer who said
[10:01.600 --> 10:13.000]  she wanted to meet about ending the ban on Russian adoption into the US. Coming up, we
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.760]  ve got video of Maxine Waters saying Russia s out together. That s coming up in the next
[10:17.760 --> 10:26.080]  segment and they hinge everything on that and now they admit there s no Russian collusion
[10:26.080 --> 10:32.200]  that they are going after obstruction and it just goes on and on. And to watch Colbert,
[10:32.200 --> 10:38.720]  we ve got the clip, it s on infowars.com. Steve Watson article. Stephen Colbert, a teleprompter
[10:38.720 --> 10:43.640]  reader posing as a comedian who poses as a newsman so you can put out fake news, he had
[10:43.640 --> 10:50.640]  Senator Rand Paul on and just kept saying, oh, but we ve got proof that Trump colluded
[10:50.640 --> 10:59.760]  with the Russians and it must be true, he s wearing smart guy glasses. It never ends.
[10:59.760 --> 11:06.280]  So that s coming up, but they re not stopping, but here s the good news. With that state
[11:06.280 --> 11:12.880]  of the union and with even the skewed polls showing Trump on average at 75%, the globalist
[11:12.880 --> 11:20.240]  have had their back broken and the left is in total free-fall panic. They re becoming
[11:20.240 --> 11:27.800]  a coastal elite party. They are imploding, they re falling apart and they ve sold this
[11:27.800 --> 11:32.640]  notion that some Republicans are retiring because they know the Democrats are about
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.440]  to take over. Most of the Republicans retiring are neocons that see the poll numbers and
[11:37.440 --> 11:41.920]  see primary challengers coming up. Some are stepping down because they re sick of just
[11:41.920 --> 11:47.120]  being in Washington like Craig Gowdy, but overall the poll numbers show that even the
[11:47.120 --> 11:55.600]  fake 10-15 points that they had in these battleground states in the 2018 election is evaporating.
[11:55.600 --> 12:00.360]  And so they re a dying party that tried to double cross the country that sold us out
[12:00.360 --> 12:05.800]  to the multinationals. The Republican establishment that worked with them in treason is being
[12:05.800 --> 12:12.640]  exposed and rooted out and ferreted out or is joining the nationalist movement. If they
[12:12.640 --> 12:18.320]  can t meet us, they re starting to join us. And so they re in full panic mode. As the
[12:18.320 --> 12:29.040]  deep state continues its memo fight, the Democrats blue wave fantasy dies on the vine. And vice
[12:29.040 --> 12:33.800]  president Pence and Trump are planning, of course, political stops to rally the troops
[12:33.800 --> 12:38.760]  across the country. And you re going to see record election fraud taking place just like
[12:38.760 --> 12:43.800]  we saw in Alabama where Roy Moore remembers 15 points behind him polls. He only loses
[12:43.800 --> 12:49.120]  by half a point. That s how they skew it to make it look like a bandwagon. Well, he s
[12:49.120 --> 12:52.960]  going to lose. I might as well vote for the other person to say I m a winner. You know,
[12:52.960 --> 12:59.760]  he s 15 points behind. Then he loses by half a point because the polls add on average 10
[12:59.760 --> 13:08.840]  to 15 points in every race. So if Trump s got a 75% approval rating on that speech,
[13:08.840 --> 13:14.280]  it means he broke through to people that were in their trance and got a lot of people, 10,
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.000]  15% or so, that were in law, law, land to finally realize this is a real message of
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.440]  unity. And wow, a lot of good stuff s happened the last year. And it was dozens and dozens
[13:25.440 --> 13:34.240]  of polls showed 70, 75, 78, 79 was the highest poll we saw. CNN s own poll fit 70% and they
[13:34.240 --> 13:42.360]  had to dismiss it. So they re going into full insane asylum mode now because they crave
[13:42.360 --> 13:49.080]  power, they crave control over the people. And Katie bar the door and the states they
[13:49.080 --> 13:53.400]  control that are falling apart, they re going to try to then create little authoritarian
[13:53.400 --> 13:58.760]  utopias for themselves. New Mexico wants to make it the law that you ve got to go to college
[13:58.760 --> 14:04.640]  and go into debt. That s in the news today. I told you they want to draft you into government
[14:04.640 --> 14:11.440]  service is what it s going to be. Also, intelligence agencies join FBI and push against plans to
[14:11.440 --> 14:17.360]  release the FISA memo. Congress is now signaling that Trump may release the memo as early as
[14:17.360 --> 14:24.800]  today. The word I heard was Monday, but that s in the news now. We ll see. The FBI is threatening
[14:24.800 --> 14:29.800]  Trump over FISA memo. All Joseph Watson article, we have those video clips coming up in the
[14:29.800 --> 14:38.120]  next segment as well. Schiff claims House Intel Republicans secretly altered spy memo
[14:38.120 --> 14:45.720]  but offers no proof. Again, Republican memo likely to be released Thursday. Administration
[14:45.720 --> 14:52.560]  officials said that s Reuters. That s today. FBI officials renew review surveillance memo
[14:52.560 --> 14:58.400]  could not cite any factual inaccuracies. They just said it s dangerous. Don t release it.
[14:58.400 --> 15:04.320]  That s Fockman s news. But the Washington Post and Reuters spun it. FBI expresses grave concerns
[15:04.320 --> 15:09.280]  close quote over Republican memo s accuracy. And they don t really do that. They just said
[15:09.280 --> 15:16.720]  that there. Disregarding FBI, White House to release Republican memo. Oh, disregarding
[15:16.720 --> 15:22.680]  the FBI because, you know, Comey and McCabe, they re the bosses over America. No, they
[15:22.680 --> 15:28.000]  re Clinton globalist operatives put in there to allow this hijacking and they re being
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.960]  removed right now. When we come back on the other side, I m going to go right through
[15:32.960 --> 15:37.360]  these clips I just mentioned. Maxine Waters says the Russians run everything. They re
[15:37.360 --> 15:40.920]  out to get her. They re hiding everywhere. And she looks like a total crazy person because
[15:40.920 --> 15:46.840]  she is. And then the FBI, basically, the Clinton holdovers threatening Trump. Hey, sorry,
[15:46.840 --> 15:50.320]  you re not going to get to run your political witch hunt. We ve got the goods. They ve already
[15:50.320 --> 15:55.280]  been released. But Moore s coming with your little secret society and your insurance policies
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.920]  and we re going to get this guy. Moore s coming. Sorry.

[19:03.120 --> 19:09.640]  to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy
[19:09.640 --> 19:18.160]  t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarsstore.com,
[19:18.160 --> 19:23.480]  you are funding the revolution. I mean I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential
[19:23.480 --> 19:27.640]  that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com. I don t want to thank everybody that has, but
[19:27.640 --> 19:32.320]  we ve got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality
[19:32.320 --> 19:36.600]  atomic iodide in it. You cannot beat that for children and adults. We ve got the best
[19:36.600 --> 19:41.480]  mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones. That s my dad with colloidal silver and iodide as well.
[19:41.480 --> 19:48.480]  infowarslife.com or triple-A2533139 and your purchase of the products stands with us, stands
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.280]  with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile
[19:52.280 --> 19:56.160]  armies and that s who they are and they know we know who they are and they re coming back
[19:56.160 --> 20:20.160]  against us so we need your support. You re listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.160 --> 20:49.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, Maxine Waters, Mad Maxine has taken to a new level. Of course there
[20:49.160 --> 20:55.560]  s all the famous clips of her saying Putin calls Trump and tells him to use terms like
[20:55.560 --> 21:03.080]  drain the swamp and lock her up. Trump couldn t come up with this. These are quotes. He
[21:03.080 --> 21:09.240]  gets it from Vladimir Putin. I mean that s like saying he gets it from a garden gnome
[21:09.240 --> 21:15.920]  sending telepathic transmissions from Mars. It s just completely bonkers and she says
[21:15.920 --> 21:21.640]  it all while died and Pelosi says similar things. Her mouth moves like she s Mr. Edd
[21:21.640 --> 21:29.920]  or something, clearly having serious neurological problems. You have this crazy aging schizophrenic,
[21:29.920 --> 21:36.400]  clearly drugged up on prescription drug democratic party that just look like they ve escaped from
[21:36.400 --> 21:44.600]  a middle ward and none of us can come up with terms ourselves or nicknames. It has to come
[21:44.600 --> 21:53.920]  from Putin who they d bill is like the master of the universe Galacticus or Megatron. Nancy
[21:53.920 --> 22:02.840]  Pelosi says I am Optimus Prime Megatron. Prepare for battle. Maxine Waters is fighting valiantly
[22:02.840 --> 22:10.720]  against the forces of the Decepticons. Their leader, Megatron, you know him as Vladimir
[22:10.720 --> 22:18.000]  Putin programs every word that Trump and Alex Jones say. I mean who believes this? But there
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.040]  are just more and more insane articles everywhere. There s this breathless one in Politico I
[22:22.040 --> 22:28.520]  read this morning where they go I m a Republican and what happened to my party? They re gaslighting
[22:28.520 --> 22:33.320]  us. The Russians have taken over everything. Our country s in total peril. They re just
[22:33.320 --> 22:38.080]  reporting it like it s absolute truth and Alex Jones is there and Congressman Gates
[22:38.080 --> 22:43.360]  are under Russian control and what are we going to do? No one is believing us anymore.
[22:43.360 --> 22:48.240]  The memo s made up by Nunes. None of us real. There s nothing there. It s already admitted
[22:48.240 --> 22:52.720]  them saying they re Democrats and we re going to stop the president. I mean we have smoking
[22:52.720 --> 22:58.200]  guns already. They re about to release even more. And I m reading this long article and
[22:58.200 --> 23:04.400]  it s kind of like a hysterical nine-year-old wrote it who was hopped up on amphetamines
[23:04.400 --> 23:09.480]  or something. I mean it s just bonkers land and then they re the ones in their alternate
[23:09.480 --> 23:17.200]  universe saying that we re Russian agents. By frankly Trump has been manipulated and
[23:17.200 --> 23:22.200]  bullied into really aggressive moves towards Russia that Russia hasn t done anything. And
[23:22.200 --> 23:26.920]  I m sick of the sanctions and I m tired of it because Russia hasn t done anything except
[23:26.920 --> 23:32.640]  help us after 9-11 and lead the charge against ISIS and become free market and Christian
[23:32.640 --> 23:37.080]  and the same Hollywood that hates Christians here and you know the same MSNBC host that
[23:37.080 --> 23:42.320]  said in the State of the Union how dare him mention family and church. That s bygone. You
[23:42.320 --> 23:46.880]  don t get to have that anymore. Like we re in a big reeducation camp. We got you in this
[23:46.880 --> 23:52.320]  sports stadium. This country s communist now. Forget families and forget churches. Hell the
[23:52.320 --> 24:00.560]  communists don t even take your families away. I mean it is just next level. These people
[24:00.560 --> 24:07.360]  are textbook authoritarians and why do we put up with somebody that looks like a crazy person
[24:07.360 --> 24:18.000]  on PCP impersonating somebody on PCP. I m forgetting the name of the famous guy, one of the founders
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.520]  of rock n roll, James Brown. That s right. I mean Maxine Waters looks like a lunatic
[24:23.520 --> 24:30.720]  asylum person escaped wearing a rubber James Brown mask and now Putin s after her because
[24:30.720 --> 24:35.320]  everybody hates her on the Internet. She s a total joke. She s disconnected from reality.
[24:35.320 --> 24:40.720]  You know even Democrat party watchdog groups back before they went completely criminal.
[24:40.720 --> 24:48.680]  They have big reports online. Look it up that she gave her husband s bank $12 million of
[24:48.680 --> 24:53.440]  taxpayer money and it just goes on and on. Stuff that anybody else would be under the
[24:53.440 --> 25:07.160]  jail for. But James Brown in drag says Putin s after her. So let s go ahead and go to James
[25:07.160 --> 25:18.680]  Brown.
[25:18.680 --> 25:46.280]  William Benning s been on. It s been in the news. It was taken at the base itself on
[25:46.280 --> 25:52.640]  what s on Drive, the download speeds, the transfer speeds and we now know it was leaked
[25:52.640 --> 25:57.080]  from inside our own government just like WikiLeaks and all the rest of it and again she just
[25:57.080 --> 26:03.000]  states these things that aren t true. We absolutely know it was the Russians that hacked the DNC
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.120]  and they always change the subject from the crimes they re committing and fixing polls
[26:07.120 --> 26:12.160]  and fixing debates and you know let s keep our constituents in the dark and desperate.
[26:12.160 --> 26:21.080]  I mean oh we re going to have urine feces and semen sir for you at the dinner. Mr. Podesta
[26:21.080 --> 26:25.960]  got a Trump speech coming up too. He s about to go live. We re going to carry that. Let
[26:25.960 --> 26:27.960]  s go back to Waters.
[26:27.960 --> 26:42.840]  We hear that. Our team is Russian television, absolutely interpret what a speech of man
[26:42.840 --> 26:45.840]  on the floor of Congress and finally after 10 minutes. They don t play. They mean business
[26:45.840 --> 26:50.480]  and so Trump is going to do everything that he can to have his way. He has shown us they
[26:50.480 --> 26:56.040]  didn t care what we think about him not staying in the White House on weekends flying down
[26:56.040 --> 27:00.360]  tomorrow long ago meeting with folks in ways he shouldn t not meet with them because we
[27:00.360 --> 27:05.360]  think classified information is being unleashed. We know you ll give up classified information
[27:05.360 --> 27:07.040]  and get it in the White House.
[27:07.040 --> 27:08.040]  This is so insane.
[27:08.040 --> 27:15.360]  Ambassador and foreign minister of Russia and so all of this is going on at the same
[27:15.360 --> 27:22.160]  time. He s carrying it out with the cabinet that you should be worried about. The education
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.720]  safety theory. All right, we re going to have to go to break and come back because I ve got
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.320]  to get into Chris Ferrell, the head of judicial watch, FBI s threatening Trump. Trey Gowdy,
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.640]  memo release will embarrass Adam Schiff. It s going to embarrass Obama and a lot more.
[27:35.640 --> 27:40.720]  So that s all coming up after this break. What a crazy time to be alive and Trump is
[27:40.720 --> 27:45.720]  said to deliver a speech at the GOP retreat where the GOP almost didn t get there because
[27:45.720 --> 27:50.600]  the dump truck rammed into it. The media called it a conspiracy theory just to question the
[27:50.600 --> 27:53.600]  event. I didn t say what I knew it was one way or the other and everybody else I know
[27:53.600 --> 27:58.440]  is questioning it as well. So that s going to be coming up. Before we go to break, please
[27:58.440 --> 28:03.080]  don t forget we ve got a bunch of big specials that are only running through the weekend
[28:03.080 --> 28:09.480]  that are about to end or each week as a special. We have Brain Force Plus, Amazing Neutropic.

[30:59.960 --> 31:04.680]  M4WarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found extraordinary
[31:04.680 --> 31:09.920]  new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear
[31:09.920 --> 31:15.200]  nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing. This
[31:15.200 --> 31:18.760]  is pollen blood. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed
[31:18.760 --> 31:24.480]  that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress
[31:24.480 --> 31:30.000]  symptoms like running nose, itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production. They began
[31:30.000 --> 31:35.320]  studying the effects in public trials, in their public trials. Now we are introducing
[31:35.320 --> 31:40.840]  the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet. Just chew two tablets at the first
[31:40.840 --> 31:46.240]  sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes
[31:46.240 --> 31:50.720]  to help alleviate seasonal distress. Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting
[31:50.720 --> 32:00.200]  pollen block available now at M4WarsLife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139. Frank in
[32:00.200 --> 32:02.520]  North Carolina, thanks for holding so long. Go ahead.
[32:02.520 --> 32:07.320]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[32:07.320 --> 32:10.040]  you're bragging. It just gets old, man.
[32:10.040 --> 32:15.120]  I'm going to shut you down right now. We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you
[32:15.120 --> 32:20.120]  understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down? Do you understand
[32:20.120 --> 32:25.160]  I'm ringing the alarm? If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean,
[32:25.160 --> 32:28.320]  what's it going to take us being shut down? Is that what you want, Frank?
[32:28.320 --> 32:29.320]  You know what, Alex?
[32:29.320 --> 32:34.800]  I put him on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are
[32:34.800 --> 32:39.400]  the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help? As much begging as I do,
[32:39.400 --> 32:43.560]  we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this. I'm not going to just stop growth
[32:43.560 --> 32:47.640]  and let them start pushing us backwards. You understand? I need your help, Frank. I need
[32:47.640 --> 32:49.640]  your help, Frank.
[32:49.640 --> 32:54.760]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info.
[32:54.760 --> 33:03.440]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank. Free press needs your help, Frank.
[33:03.440 --> 33:28.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.440 --> 33:45.040]  We're here waiting for the president when he pops in to deliver his speech that will
[33:45.040 --> 33:50.400]  carry excerpts of live, not the whole thing, from the Republican retreat they were traveling
[33:50.400 --> 33:55.640]  to yesterday when the train had a dump truck run into it, mysteriously. So we got a lot
[33:55.640 --> 34:00.760]  of answers on that front that I got a bunch of clips I want to play right now. First off,
[34:00.760 --> 34:11.440]  I want to remind people just a small sampling, a small snippet of some of the media bullies,
[34:11.440 --> 34:17.240]  the people that make McCarthy look like an angel saying this person's a Russian agent,
[34:17.240 --> 34:25.800]  that person's a Russian agent, Tucker Carlson, myself, Rand Paul. It's crazy and it's so
[34:25.800 --> 34:30.400]  authoritarian, it's so anti-American and they're the globalists that are selling the sovereignty
[34:30.400 --> 34:36.960]  of the country out. I mean, Trump is actually militarizing the borders with Russia, selling
[34:36.960 --> 34:41.960]  weapons to Ukraine when Soros started that war. And really, that's one of the big bad
[34:41.960 --> 34:49.400]  things Trump is doing is being more aggressive towards Russia than even Obama and it's one
[34:49.400 --> 34:53.760]  thing Trump's actually caved in on to prove he's not this Russian agent. So that's
[34:53.760 --> 35:00.560]  si-op work. And Trump may know what he's doing on this subject, but it's just such a hoax.
[35:00.560 --> 35:06.080]  Why go along with it? I mean, that's why I decided and I have gotten my visa to Russia
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.520]  and I'm going to go there sometime in the next few months. I tweeted out the joke that
[35:10.520 --> 35:16.520]  oh my gosh, here's the proof that I'm a Russian agent because if you talk to a Russian, that's
[35:16.520 --> 35:21.680]  collusion. Even though you're trying to find out corruption about Hillary Clinton, if you're
[35:21.680 --> 35:27.480]  Don Jr. and certainly if you get a visa to Russia, it's a bad thing. But if you're Hillary
[35:27.480 --> 35:31.080]  and you meet secretly with Putin or you get money from the Russians to actually sell us
[35:31.080 --> 35:37.400]  out, then that's okay. If there's real collusion, then we don't talk about that. But you see,
[35:37.400 --> 35:46.920]  if you go to real Alex Jones, I tweeted out a shot of my Russian visa because I'm sure
[35:46.920 --> 35:50.760]  the media will have a heyday with that because I'm going to troll them when I go to Russia.
[35:50.760 --> 35:54.120]  It's ridiculous. And I want to talk about the history of what the globalists have done
[35:54.120 --> 36:01.040]  to Russia as well, just like the same leftist want to control us and enslave us and attack
[36:01.040 --> 36:06.840]  Christianity and the family. MSNBC said, oh Trump, how dare you talk about family and how
[36:06.840 --> 36:12.560]  dare you talk about Christians? How dare you talk about church? You don't have that anymore.
[36:12.560 --> 36:17.800]  That's bygone. That's the threat. That's the evil. That's the same crap that ran Russia
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.000]  for 85 years and it's staring us right in the eyeballs. And I'm just glad as an American
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.120]  people we're standing up and saying no. But let's go ahead and go to this compilation
[36:27.120 --> 36:32.600]  of them telling anybody that doesn't submit to them is a Russian agent.
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.640]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to I think Ms. Spears' question that there
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.800]  are other RTs operating in the U.S. Can you describe them, list them?
[36:42.800 --> 36:50.560]  Sure, thank you. So you have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley, and then I think
[36:50.560 --> 36:58.080]  you have them feeding other entities. InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[36:58.080 --> 37:08.760]  Dr. Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign?
[37:08.760 --> 37:15.600]  The Russians say WikiLeaks, same thing. Is it possible that the Republican chairman of
[37:15.600 --> 37:18.440]  the House of the Intel Committee has been compromised by the Russians? Is it possible
[37:18.440 --> 37:21.320]  that they actually have a Russian agent? That guy's been compromised.
[37:21.320 --> 37:28.640]  I note that Senator from Kentucky on the floor, I will say before I read this, if there's
[37:28.640 --> 37:32.080]  objection, you are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin.
[37:32.080 --> 37:37.080]  Is Senator from Kentucky? I object. Objection is heard.
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.760]  The Senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[37:42.760 --> 37:46.040]  Russian scum! Some in Congress are demanding that President
[37:46.040 --> 37:51.520]  Obama brief them on Russian interference with the election. They say that the Russians
[37:51.520 --> 37:53.680]  quote, hacked our democracy and they're mad about it.
[37:53.680 --> 37:57.880]  These hacks were of such seriousness, they could not have taken place without the approval
[37:57.880 --> 38:02.840]  of the highest levels of the Kremlin. That's speculation, and we've seen what is speculation.
[38:02.840 --> 38:07.560]  Russian hackers used social media to interfere with the 2016 election. Then Russian media
[38:07.560 --> 38:11.200]  reports on the rumors Russians created and they creep through the media cesspool so they
[38:11.200 --> 38:15.360]  get on real news. I've listened to you longer than the NSA has
[38:15.360 --> 38:22.360]  and watched your show and I have to say you're probably the worst double speaking liar there
[38:22.360 --> 38:28.560]  is and I can prove it. The first thing is when it comes to Russia, there's one thing
[38:28.560 --> 38:36.000]  that you could do to prove it, but you won't. Release your finances and prove to your audience
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.280]  where your money actually comes from. Hey, hey, listen bro, you have nothing.
[38:40.280 --> 38:44.200]  I appreciate your call. You got your proof, I appreciate your call.
[38:44.200 --> 38:49.560]  There you go, folks. I must be paid by the Russians. They have nothing.
[38:49.560 --> 38:55.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. That was just a short section. We didn't include
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.200]  the hearings and things in there where they go, you know, in full wars that works for
[38:58.200 --> 39:03.840]  the Russians. It's crazy. I'm not willing to have them beat me over the head into calling
[39:03.840 --> 39:07.680]  for war with Russia and thinking Russians are hiding under the table.
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.600]  This whole hoax is going to end up going down in flames and it already is. And just wait
[39:12.600 --> 39:18.720]  till Trump releases the memo. It's just another domino to fold. Now here is Chris Ferrell,
[39:18.720 --> 39:24.720]  the director of judicial watch, director of investigations at judicial watch, saying that
[39:24.720 --> 39:29.320]  the FBI behind the scenes, at least the Clinton holdovers, are threatening the president.
[39:29.320 --> 39:36.240]  And of course they are. They're the holdovers the entire time that are dug in. And then
[39:36.240 --> 39:41.440]  Trump goes, oh, you're a good guy. I'll put McCabe in. He's the ringleader of it who got
[39:41.440 --> 39:49.560]  $500,000 from Hillary to his wife. I mean, it's, it's amazing. And the media won't even
[39:49.560 --> 39:53.680]  tell you this is going on. They just, they just say, we don't know why McCabe stood down.
[39:53.680 --> 39:58.360]  It must have been fired. Boy, these Russians are really powerful and Maxine Waters is giving
[39:58.360 --> 40:06.400]  speeches going, I'm under Russian attack. They're playing hardball. It's insane. Okay,
[40:06.400 --> 40:09.120]  let's go ahead and go to Chris Ferrell.
[40:09.120 --> 40:14.800]  Let me boil it down real simple. The FBI is threatening the president of the United States.
[40:14.800 --> 40:15.800]  How so?
[40:15.800 --> 40:19.480]  Well, you know, they're going to come out. First of all, they've tried to put him in
[40:19.480 --> 40:26.720]  a corner and say, hey, look, we really don't want you revealing all the criminality that's
[40:26.720 --> 40:33.240]  going on in the organization. And so they're in a very reactive sort of posture. And so
[40:33.240 --> 40:37.520]  they, they broker a meeting with the chief of staff who's the wrong person to meet with,
[40:37.520 --> 40:42.760]  first of all, yeah, I would think it. And then secondly, even after this supposed negotiation
[40:42.760 --> 40:49.480]  where the, where the White House gave up its, its power, gave up its position of authority,
[40:49.480 --> 40:53.920]  they acquiesced to a meeting which never should have happened with five negotiators who I'm
[40:53.920 --> 41:00.080]  sure, you know, call themselves experts, you know, cautioning and warning and, oh, you
[41:00.080 --> 41:07.320]  know, General Kelly, this will be a grave problem. They, they try to intimidate in order
[41:07.320 --> 41:11.960]  to cover up for their criminality. And then when they're all done, they still come out
[41:11.960 --> 41:15.960]  with a statement. What was the last time the FBI came out with a statement on anything,
[41:15.960 --> 41:21.560]  Lou? Yeah, well, it's a great point because they haven't, I still haven't seen the Benghazi
[41:21.560 --> 41:25.800]  report. I still haven't, we can go through the list. Yeah, exactly. That's good. Let's
[41:25.800 --> 41:26.800]  stop there.
[41:26.800 --> 41:27.800]  Where truth goes.
[41:27.800 --> 41:32.520]  We're going to go now to Trey Gowdy. Memo release will be embarrassing to Adam Schiff.
[41:32.520 --> 41:37.320]  Colleagues didn't want us to find this information. They did everything they could to keep us
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.280]  from finding this information. So of course they don't want to be embarrassing to them.
[41:42.280 --> 41:46.440]  I think it'll be embarrassing to Adam Schiff once people realize the extent to which he
[41:46.440 --> 41:50.440]  went to keep them from learning any of this. So that, that would be the embarrassment.
[41:50.440 --> 41:51.440]  Go ahead.
[41:51.440 --> 42:00.080]  What do you mean? I mean, going to court to, to, to help Fusion GPS so we can't find out
[42:00.080 --> 42:08.640]  that they paid for the, for the dossier and that they will translate that Adam Schiff.
[42:08.640 --> 42:16.240]  So Trey Gowdy saying Adam Schiff obstructed justice and tried to block the release in
[42:16.240 --> 42:22.840]  court. The Democratic leader of the Intelligence Committee, the number two person tried to
[42:22.840 --> 42:30.440]  obstruct. That's what's coming out. That's in the memo. He's telling you tried to obstruct
[42:30.440 --> 42:34.320]  information about who paid for Fusion GPS coming out. We already know from the evidence
[42:34.320 --> 42:38.520]  of some of the text. It was the FBI that paid for it. So when we come back, we're going
[42:38.520 --> 42:45.200]  to finish up with this powerful clip straight ahead with Trey Gowdy laying out a big chunk
[42:45.200 --> 42:50.040]  of why this is so serious for Schiff and why Schiff looks even more squirrely eyed and
[42:50.040 --> 42:55.160]  criminal than ever. And what a pack of un-American scum. And they're so pissed. The country's
[42:55.160 --> 42:59.960]  coming back. They just don't know what to do.
[42:59.960 --> 43:06.240]  I'm so excited. The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[43:06.240 --> 43:12.760]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill. This is a heart and brain
[43:12.760 --> 43:18.560]  pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it. But boy does it stimulate because it's
[43:18.560 --> 43:24.880]  beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.440]  their patients, but it wasn't prescription. But they were charging people $100, $200 for
[43:30.440 --> 43:35.600]  the formulae. And I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
[43:35.600 --> 43:42.840]  Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[43:42.840 --> 43:48.280]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[43:48.280 --> 43:56.080]  hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and

[44:20.000 --> 44:26.160]  immune wall is incredible at folks. Other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-80.

[44:44.080 --> 44:48.600]  level. It's now available, ladies and gentlemen. Immune wall, I think it's beyond seasonal.
[44:48.600 --> 44:54.240]  Beta-glucan, olive leaf, and more. Immune wall, m4warsstore.com, m4warslive.com or triple

[47:03.560 --> 47:25.920]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[47:25.920 --> 47:33.400]  Alex Jones. We are back live. Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, the
[47:33.400 --> 47:39.560]  first day of February 2000, an 18 transmission. We are set as soon as the president speaks
[47:39.560 --> 47:44.120]  to play a few minutes of that live here in just a moment as he approaches the podium.
[47:44.120 --> 47:48.360]  And then, Craig Addy's come out and said Adam Schiff obstructed justice. The evidence
[47:48.360 --> 47:53.120]  will show that's coming out in the memo trying to use congressional power to block courts
[47:53.120 --> 47:59.360]  releasing information on who paid for fusion GPS. We know who did, the FBI and the Democrats.
[47:59.360 --> 48:02.840]  Let's go to the president live at the Republican retreat in West Virginia.
[48:02.840 --> 48:07.400]  Thank you Paul and Mitch for the introduction and for your tremendous leadership. You folks
[48:07.400 --> 48:13.840]  have done well. I just looked at some numbers you've even done better than you thought,
[48:13.840 --> 48:19.920]  I think, based on what we just saw about 10 minutes ago. And I want to thank you to the
[48:19.920 --> 48:25.880]  governor of this incredible state, my very good friend, Jim Justice, and his wonderful
[48:25.880 --> 48:32.920]  wife, Kathy, who are with us. And Jim is now a proud member of the Republican Party. He
[48:32.920 --> 48:38.600]  was a Democrat. He switched over, right? You don't see that too often. Maybe you'll
[48:38.600 --> 48:43.160]  see it more and more, but thank you Jim. And the hotel is beautiful and everything's beautiful.
[48:43.160 --> 48:47.280]  The blue state, fantasy. Great to be among so many friends for the second time. The blue
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.440]  wave, fantasies collapsing and all the polls. Even their fake polls show they're negative
[48:51.440 --> 49:01.360]  now. As we were all inspired. And I really mean that we were inspired by America's heroes
[49:01.360 --> 49:09.240]  and uplifted by everyone who has sacrificed in the fight for freedom. They were and are
[49:09.240 --> 49:15.640]  incredible people that we saw that night and tremendous courage. And one of the people,
[49:15.640 --> 49:25.240]  I have to say, boy, you got a very big hand, Steve. Steve Scalise. A great hand. And we're
[49:25.240 --> 49:30.880]  all truly blessed to be Americans before going any further. I want to send our prayers to
[49:30.880 --> 49:35.840]  everyone affected by the train accident yesterday, especially to the family of the person who
[49:35.840 --> 49:40.960]  was so tragically killed. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones. And
[49:40.960 --> 49:49.120]  thank you. With us today on stage is our incredible leadership team. And they really have, if
[49:49.120 --> 49:54.680]  you look, you just look at what's happened in the last short period of time. Without
[49:54.680 --> 49:58.720]  them, I could have never won the presidency, I guess. I don't know. Could I have won the
[49:58.720 --> 50:07.760]  presidency without them? Steve, yes, right? I don't know. But they become very good friends
[50:07.760 --> 50:13.280]  and we're now in battle together, and in friendship together. Senate Majority Leader
[50:13.280 --> 50:21.880]  Mitch McConnell. Thank you, Mitch. Great guy. That was a big win we had, Mitch. Senate Majority
[50:21.880 --> 50:29.920]  Whip, John Cornyn. John, thank you. Great job. House Majority Whip, Steve Scalise. Again,
[50:29.920 --> 50:35.840]  Steve. Thank you. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kevin.
[50:35.840 --> 50:41.800]  All right. We're going to go back to the president lives. He's just, he's there, you know, celebrating
[50:41.800 --> 50:45.480]  everybody and celebrating American. But I'm sure he'll have some meat potatoes on the
[50:45.480 --> 50:49.920]  next wave, the next agenda to make America great again. So we'll go back to him in just
[50:49.920 --> 50:55.240]  a few minutes. I wanted to play this because it's so bombshell. This is Trey Gowdy on Fox
[50:55.240 --> 51:02.160]  and Friends today saying, shift's going to be really embarrassed by all of this. The
[51:02.160 --> 51:05.840]  head Democrat on the intelligence committee, because he's been leading the witch hunt from
[51:05.840 --> 51:11.240]  the inside, trying to block courts using congressional power, arguing don't release
[51:11.240 --> 51:17.120]  who paid for fusion GPS and the lawsuits in any of it. So again, this is a big deal. This
[51:17.120 --> 51:23.400]  is obstruction is what he's saying. So let's go to that clip. My Democrat colleagues didn't
[51:23.400 --> 51:27.400]  want us to find this information. They did everything they could to keep us from finding
[51:27.400 --> 51:32.600]  this information. So of course they don't want to be embarrassing to them. I think it'll
[51:32.600 --> 51:36.760]  be embarrassing to Adam Schiff once people realize the extent to which he went to keep
[51:36.760 --> 51:43.240]  them from learning any of this. So that would be the embarrassing. What do you mean? I mean
[51:43.240 --> 51:53.360]  going to court to help fusion GPS so we can't find out that they paid for the dossier and
[51:53.360 --> 51:58.040]  that they were working for the DNC. That's a pretty big step to go to court to try to
[51:58.040 --> 52:02.160]  keep the American people from learning something. So look, if it were up to Adam Schiff, you
[52:02.160 --> 52:05.600]  wouldn't know about Hillary Clinton's email. You wouldn't know about the server. You wouldn't
[52:05.600 --> 52:10.680]  know who paid for the dossier. So I do find it ironic that he has his own memo now because
[52:10.680 --> 52:12.440]  if he were up to him, we wouldn't know any of it.
[52:12.440 --> 52:16.480]  Aren't we all in search of the truth though? I mean, Democrats and Republicans should be
[52:16.480 --> 52:17.480]  in search of the truth.
[52:17.480 --> 52:22.200]  That's enough of that. Shut it down. And again, he's using congressional power to go in and
[52:22.200 --> 52:27.640]  try to block something that his party and then the FBI, his people paid for. And he's
[52:27.640 --> 52:32.360]  quarterbacking the whole thing now that McCain's dying of brain cancer. And he's like this
[52:32.360 --> 52:36.560]  God they put up there who runs around calling everybody Russian agents. I quite frankly,
[52:36.560 --> 52:42.400]  I'm sick of it. I'm tired of it. And they're trying to stand in the way of America's recovery
[52:42.400 --> 52:46.840]  because they want to keep you poor on their Democrat plantation. Let's go back to the
[52:46.840 --> 52:52.560]  president live in his remarks and see if he's gotten into his main statement on his call
[52:52.560 --> 52:56.320]  for bipartisanship. We're supposedly going to hear that was a tough year. Instead of
[52:56.320 --> 53:01.080]  that was one of the greatest years in the history of politics and the history of our
[53:01.080 --> 53:06.320]  country for a party, what we've done and what we've accomplished. I think it's been done
[53:06.320 --> 53:14.280]  and certainly not by much. We we had a year that was almost, I would think, unlike any.
[53:14.280 --> 53:18.520]  It was a tremendous success. And I give everybody in this room the credit and I give certainly
[53:18.520 --> 53:25.120]  these people behind me tremendous credit for what took place. American remark last month.
[53:25.120 --> 53:29.760]  That was a month of tremendous pressure. And that was people that were able to act under
[53:29.760 --> 53:37.080]  pressure. My favorite type of person. They were able to act under tremendous pressure.
[53:37.080 --> 53:41.840]  So I just want to thank you all because that's what it was all about. And you know, it was
[53:41.840 --> 53:47.200]  interesting. While we had a great year, we weren't being given credit for it. Regulations
[53:47.200 --> 53:52.280]  at a level that nobody has ever done in one year. We knocked out more regulations than
[53:52.280 --> 53:59.960]  anybody. Supreme Court justice judges all over so many different records, so many successes.
[53:59.960 --> 54:06.040]  But when we got the great tax cut bill and we call it the tax cut and jobs bill, we got
[54:06.040 --> 54:12.000]  that it was like putting it all in a box and wrapping it with a beautiful ribbon. We started
[54:12.000 --> 54:17.200]  getting credit, not only for that, but for all of the other things that we did during
[54:17.200 --> 54:19.720]  the year. It's amazing. That's right. The hoax is collapsing.
[54:19.720 --> 54:21.960]  It's surprising. People are believing their eyes and their
[54:21.960 --> 54:27.240]  pocketbooks. And a lot of people and all of a sudden they're saying, while he had a lot
[54:27.240 --> 54:33.760]  of accomplishment, and then they went on to do the thing. But the fact is, you understand
[54:33.760 --> 54:37.800]  that the big breakthrough we did, we got a lot of credit. It broke your back, Mr. President,
[54:37.800 --> 54:44.680]  the final month. We did. I give everybody in this room, really, kudos. We're a nation
[54:44.680 --> 54:50.960]  of builders and dreamers and strivers and fighters. And together we're building a safe, strong
[54:50.960 --> 55:00.800]  and very proud America already since the election. We've created 2.4 million jobs. That's unthinkable.
[55:00.800 --> 55:04.080]  And that doesn't include all of the things that are happening.
[55:04.080 --> 55:09.000]  And he'll go through the litany. We're going to go to break here in a moment. And so we'll
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.280]  be able to, this is live right now, but we'll obviously be able to rewind it to those points
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.520]  and get some of the main snippets for you. We've got Mike Adams, the health ranger joining
[55:16.520 --> 55:20.960]  us in studio with his big high tech lab and scientist. He's got one of the, now one of
[55:20.960 --> 55:26.160]  the top labs out there, some of the most fancy equipment there is. He tested the tide balls
[55:26.160 --> 55:30.440]  that have been this big craze to see if there's something addictive in it that people found
[55:30.440 --> 55:35.720]  a lot of poisons are addictive. And what he found was in these things, chemical lies,
[55:35.720 --> 55:42.840]  is insane. So that is coming up with Mike Adams, about 15 minutes to the next hour.
[55:42.840 --> 55:48.120]  We're going to have that for you for a few segments from CWC labs. And then we're going
[55:48.120 --> 55:54.120]  to continue and open the phones up and take your phone calls today in the third and fourth

[58:59.760 --> 59:04.960]  the t shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic. And that really is a
[59:04.960 --> 59:10.160]  great way to deal with this battle in the info war. It might seem like a simple thing,
[59:10.160 --> 59:15.080]  but they particularly these slogan t shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely
[59:15.080 --> 59:20.280]  amazing. Well, thank you. My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says

[59:46.360 --> 01:00:02.240]  exclusively in info wars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Now in our number
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.360]  two, Trump speaking live more of that coming up. But first, you know, they say if you talk
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:13.560]  to a Russian, that's Russian collusion. And Putin magically runs everything. Maxine water
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:19.120]  says Putin's after her and that he tells Trump what to say and do. So I've told people I
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:25.400]  intend to go to Russia sometime the next six months or so to go see who supposedly I'm
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:31.000]  getting orders from never been to Russia. There's a couple Russians in my life. A great
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.120]  lady from Russia works here. Came here as a kid was in the US military Patriot. But
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:42.440]  you know, you can't trust any of them, folks. You can trust is Adam Schiff. Yes. But there's
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.440]  the tweet looking forward to Putin giving me the new hashtag using it's Hillary and
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:54.320]  the Dems. It's my Russian visa that came in yesterday. So you can see my name there in
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.240]  Russian. That's the proof right there, ladies and gentlemen. Absolute death penalty. Now
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.880]  that's it. Real Alex Jones, your radio listener want to see that. But here's a joke clip. We
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.080]  shot at a nice little restaurant a few months ago, Russia House, and there is a Russian
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:14.440]  in the shot. Can you spot her as I'm surrounded by lovely ladies? Here it is. We pledge allegiance
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:21.040]  to comrade Putin and his great minion, Donald J. Trump to make America great again. We pledge
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:26.040]  this plan to destroy the Americans to save their economy and their people and their border
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:36.080]  and their military. Hail Putin. Hail Russia. We will never surrender. Yes, that is the
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:52.440]  KGB plan. Well done. Now I'm not using my fake taxes accent. Now I am using my true Russian
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:02:00.800]  accent when I speak like Merit Komsky Yankee scum. They had new sanctions against Russia
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.720]  and tanks and weapons being given to Ukraine to attack Russia. That is what we have funded
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:14.160]  Putin's minion, Donald J. Trump to do and to not give Russia credit for knocking out
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:19.680]  ISIS. That is why we put him in and to increase US military and nuclear weapons and control
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.640]  border and take care of veterans and hire millions and then take jobs away from Russia.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:34.480]  Oh, Trump is doing well for us. He is doing so well. Having the United States become dominant
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:41.560]  on the world stage again. It is not the globalist that we're hurting America. No. I try to talk
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:48.840]  Russian. I sound like cookie monster. Oh, cookie. Oh, and of course this unclassified
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:54.960]  Trump preparing new sanctions against Russia. Report to Congress pursuant to Section 241.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:02.000]  They've had this for a long time and it's where he's targeting hundreds of Russian millionaires
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.320]  and billionaires saying we're targeting you. We're watching you and we may take all your
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:13.560]  assets with the proof. This is the true sign of a Russian agent. Yes, targeting Russians
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:20.400]  taking their money for no reason. Down with America. That's why Trump says America first
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.880]  and wants you to have optimism. That is how we demoralize you. Two plus two equals 500.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:33.120]  I agree. And comrade Putin is after Maxine Waters. She wants to bring America into the
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:41.400]  global system and destroy it. But our comrade is helping America. Again, I'm having trouble.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.840]  I need to listen to somebody with a Russian accent. I'm gonna do a better job. But there
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:50.120]  it is. Tweeted out a lot of shows. Looking forward to Putin giving me the new hashtag
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:57.280]  to use against Hillary and the Dems. And I'm told Charlie Weasel over at Peepie Feed, over
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.480]  at Poo Poo Feed, over at BS Feed, over at S Hole Feed. Remember the former deputy director
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.680]  of the CIA said, I'm a proud, you know what, holder. Well, you know what, holders over
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.240]  there are gonna have some good fun with this. You know, I'm not giving it into their
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.920]  crap. I mean, if they said, we're gonna call you a Nazi, if you don't do what we say, I'd
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:21.480]  say go to hell. Oh, by the way, they did that. And then they called me a communist when I
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.840]  was mad at Bush about stuff. And when I didn't like Bill Clinton, I was a right-wing racist.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:35.360]  And I just, I just learned. But now I'm a Russian agent. See? So, ha ha ha. I have fooled
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.680]  them yet again, though. Ha ha ha. We're gonna return to a place of other key clips that
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.160]  are more of Trump's speech and then hit some other economic news. It's absolutely key.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.840]  Bitcoin coming up and so much more. We've got George Soros openly trying to police the
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.680]  Internet, which he's doing at YouTube, and now telling Facebook to take me down. Well,
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.560]  he's a real live Nazi collaborator, so it's okay.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.920]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from infowarslife.com. But instead
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.120]  of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.680]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence. We
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.960]  know chicken noodle soup. It's great for people that are sick. Again, in every culture, this
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:22.640]  has been reported because it works. And there's no way to quantify how strong this is. But
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:29.200]  the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:34.920]  force that is in this is incredible. Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints,
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.400]  whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:44.960]  for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:49.680]  formula out there. And it's amazing. Find out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:54.280]  What it can do for your family. And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:22.760]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide. I'm going to go back to more of
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:36.680]  Trump's ongoing speech in West Virginia the day after the train carrying the Republicans
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:43.600]  to the destination. The speaker of the house got hit by a truck. So dump trucks. We're
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.800]  going to be playing some more of that here in just a moment. And then I've got more of
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:56.680]  these clips here with the absolute out of control Democrat hysteria going on. Now just
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:02.320]  saying anyone even questioning the FBI is a Russian agent, including chairman of the
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:09.800]  committee, intelligence committee, Devin Nunes. So that's their plan. Overturn the election.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:15.040]  Is there is their real brass ring? Hold new elections run by Democrat controlled homeland
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:22.080]  security. And we never have a real election again. We're going to go back to that also.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.280]  Canada passes bill to make O Canada lyrics gender neutral. So the war on men and women
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:34.400]  accelerates as MSNBC says how dare him talk about families and how dare him talk about
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:40.160]  churches. That's a bygone era and you don't have that anymore. Wow. I mean, talk about
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:52.000]  bad guys, but let's go back to the president. I think very, very special. And when I made
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.600]  that statement the other night, there was zero movement from the Democrats. They sat
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:05.440]  there stone called no smile, no applause. You would have thought that on that one, they
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:11.160]  would have sort of at least clapped a little bit, which tells you perhaps they'd rather
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:16.840]  see us not do well than see our country do great. And that's not good. That's not good.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:24.120]  We have to change that. And as I said, we've eliminated more regulations in our first year
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:31.160]  than any administration has ever eliminated. And that means four years, eight years, or
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:38.360]  in one instance, 16 years. In one year, we've knocked out more regulations. It's an amazing
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.560]  thing. And I happen to think that that is every bit as important toward our success
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:48.120]  as the tax cuts. I have many business friends and many people in business that came to me
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.760]  and they say that, including small businesses, they say the fact that they no longer have
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:09:00.400]  to go through years of turmoil in getting approved and getting approvals and getting
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.360]  rule changes and getting all sorts of things and getting old while they're waiting to
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:11.520]  get them. The fact that all of that is gone is probably as important or even more important
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:17.040]  to the mess of tax cuts we've gotten people. So that's something we've signed into law,
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:23.200]  the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. And I have to say included in there
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:30.080]  is the individual mandate. We repealed it. That's a big one. That's so big. By itself,
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.400]  that would be a big achievement. And we sort of take it as, well, that was included. And
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:44.480]  ANWAR, one of the great potential fields anywhere in the world. And I never appreciated ANWAR
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.080]  so much. A friend of mine called up who's in that world and in that business said, is
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:52.240]  it true that you're thinking about ANWAR? I said, yeah, I think we're going to get it.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.800]  But you know, he said, are you kidding? That's the biggest thing by itself. He said, Ronald
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:02.160]  Reagan and every president has wanted to get ANWAR approved. And after that, I said, oh,
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.560]  make sure that's in the bill. It was amazing how that had an impact. That had a very big
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.840]  impact on me, Paul. I really didn't care about it. And then when I heard that everybody wanted
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.080]  it for 40 years, they've been trying to get it approved. I said, make sure you don't lose ANWAR.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:24.480]  But it's great for the people of Alaska. And Senator Sullivan, Senator Mikowsky are here
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:30.960]  someplace. Where are they? But they are very happy campers. Where's Senator? Good Senator. Thank you.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:41.280]  They worked very, where's Don Young? He's such a quiet guy. Where's Don? Don Young also. Don, thank you.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.400]  So no, we were always going to get it. We never had a problem with it. But you think about it,
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:56.480]  that by itself is a big bill. The individual mandate by itself is a big, powerful bill.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.000]  That was just added on to what we did with the massive tax cuts. I want to thank Senator
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  Finance Chairman and a very spectacular man, Oren Hatch. Where's Oren? Oren. Oren is,
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:17.920]  I love listening to him speak. He said once, I am the single greatest president in his lifetime.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.240]  Now he's a young man, so it's not that much. And he actually once said I'm the greatest
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.160]  president in the history of our country. And I said, does that include Lincoln in Washington?
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:32.480]  He said, yes. I said, I love this guy. I love him. But he is, he's a special guy.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:40.720]  And House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady for their incredible work. Kevin, where are you, Kevin?
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:49.920]  What a job. I'd call Kevin night after night. Kevin, what about this? What about that? You
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:55.280]  were always there. He was working. What did you average sleep for about four weeks? About
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.640]  maybe nothing. I think he had no average. All right, let's stop right here. We're going to come
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.840]  back with more. Mike Adams is joining us in the next segment to talk about the little
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:13.600]  tied pods the last month that has been a big national sensation with young people,
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.720]  teenagers eating them and then vomiting and being rushed to poison control centers. So
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.120]  Mike thought, why don't we test and actually see what's in these
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.040]  with their spectrometers and all their fancy equipment at his big testing lab he has. Of
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.600]  course, he heads up naturalnews.com and so much more best-selling author and filmmaker.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.680]  So that's coming up. Speaking of tied
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:49.040]  pads or balls or whatever you call them, pods, I would know we use little organic ones at my house.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:13:01.040]  When I got attacked by Stephen Colbert a few weeks ago, he impersonates me
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:13.280]  and then had had me via the character, Tuck Boatford, eating tied pellets, tied balls and
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:20.720]  again, it just shows how they forward something destructive and help create the hysteria,
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:29.200]  ride at its peak and then they pawn it off like I did it. Again, it's not funny, but speaking of
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:38.960]  the laundry pods, video Rand Paul drops truth bomb on Colbert pointing out that this isn't
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:46.400]  Russian collusion investigation. Now, this is nothing more than an obstruction case where they're
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:52.160]  trying to get somebody to say the president lied so a Democrat minion can go to a grand jury in
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:58.480]  the swamp in DC and try to indict the president to embarrass him out of office to kill the recovery
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.040]  you were just hearing about and that you're witnessing. These people are the enemy of our
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.800]  recovery and our country and they've been doing it by design. So Steve Watson wrote about it.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:15.040]  It's on infowars.com and newswars.com. Here is the clip Rand Paul drops truth bombs on the
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.800]  tied pod pusher Stephen Colbert. I got to ask you, you said that the Bob Mueller investigation
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.600]  was a witch hunt and that it was a distraction of Congress's time. Do you think it should be
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.560]  ended? Do you think he should be gotten out of there to think that you get rid of Rosenstein
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.160]  and release the memo and just blow the whole thing up and forget it ever happened?
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.640]  I'm concerned. My biggest concern is over something that Madison said in the beginning
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.600]  of our country. He said that men are not angels and that's what we need more oversight of government.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.280]  Our intelligence community has the ability to listen to every phone call. Everyone in your
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.120]  phone calls could be listened to if they wanted to. Everyone of your emails can be tracked. Everyone
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.120]  of your phone, who you call and how long you speak can be tracked. Every bank transition can be
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:59.760]  tracked. And so I think because men are not angels and women aren't either, is that there could be
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:03.600]  bias enter into the intelligence community and we have to be very, very careful that someone
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.120]  gives them a check and a balance and that check and a balance should be a judge and a warrant.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.520]  So one of the things I fought with over this collection of FISA data was we should go to
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:17.120]  a judge to get to that. What does that have to do with Mueller? I'm concerned that we've given
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.920]  too much power to a prosecutor. He's supposed to go after Russian collusion. So far he's gotten
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.360]  someone over. He recorded General Flynn's phone call and then got him to say something inconsistent
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.280]  with what was recorded in the phone call. Think about it from a personal perspective. If I had
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:36.320]  a thousand phone calls from Stephen Colbert, what I could learn and then if I can interview you and
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.400]  if you say anything inconsistent with what you said on your private phone calls, I can put you
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:46.080]  in jail. Well, if what I said in the private phone call was that, yeah, I met with the Russians
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.520]  over sanctions and then you asked me to be with the Russians over sanctions and you say no,
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.920]  then lock me up. So they cut it off there to make it look like a zinger, like he's a big genius,
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:58.880]  but that's not what was there. Looking for obstruction. Here's a special message for those

[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.760]  Introducing Floor Life. The new probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowars Life.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.960]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same. Floor
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:14.000]  Life probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.920]  directly into the intestines for maximum effect. This is critical because stomach acid kills most
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.640]  probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:29.680]  health and your wallet. Floor Life supports your body's core where you need it most, including
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:35.200]  digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism. Did you know that over 80% of your
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.640]  immune system is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:45.840]  for overall health. Floor Life is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.320]  and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program. Head to

[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.760]  from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.

[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:32.320]  All right. Joining us for the balance of the hour, Mike Adams of naturalnews.com.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:37.920]  He also heads up a big national lab that tests her thousands of different chemicals for hundreds
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:45.040]  of different companies, foods, you name it. And he had an idea last week because of the whole
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.080]  situation with laundry pods from Tide that was the big craze and still is the craze with young
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.440]  people eating them on air. He had the idea to test that. And what he found was incredible.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.880]  Exclusive Tide laundry pods found to contain over 700 chemicals, independent lab test results
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:08.000]  released the public, stories at naturalnews.com. We're posting it as well to Infowars.com. It's
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.120]  also at science.news, one of his other big sites. So Mike Adams is here with us. That's coming up
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:18.960]  the next segment. He won it. We're going to show you the scans, the chemicals, all of the bizarreness
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:26.000]  that young people are taking. A lot of poisons or toxic things famously have been used as drugs,
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.920]  like people who were addicted to arsenic, like Jack the Ripper. So that's coming up next segment.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.880]  Mike, good to have you back. Let's first get into what you wanted to talk about when we're
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:37.360]  talking during the break about now they're set to release the memo tomorrow. They're saying
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:44.560]  the Pfizer memo, what we see happening in this country. How would you quantify the place America
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:49.520]  is right now historically? Well, this is history in the making. This is a historic moment for
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:55.440]  America. No question about it. But I would also warn that this is a prime opportunity for the left
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.400]  to try to pull off a false flag distraction, frankly. And you know, that's me saying and not
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.280]  you saying it right here. If they can distract from the information that's going to come out,
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:11.280]  the obstruction of justice by Obama's DOJ and Obama's FBI, they will try anything. As you know,
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:15.840]  they will do anything to change the narrative and distract from this. Because I believe that there
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.800]  could be as many as 100 people being indicted, some of them going to prison, some of them turning
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:26.080]  and testifying against others from the Obama administration and the DNC and then the Hillary
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:32.480]  Clinton Foundation and all of that. The level of evil and corruption and obstruction is so
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.880]  extraordinary that when this comes out, America will never be the same again.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.680]  I played the clip earlier, so I won't play it again now. But Craig Gowdy came out and on Fox
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.480]  and Friends this morning and said to the world that listen, what's going to embarrass Schiff
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.280]  that's running all this for the Democrats in the House on the Intelligence Committee
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:54.080]  is that he's in there obstructing trying to block documents coming out and going to courts
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:58.320]  and saying, don't release who funded Fusion GPS. Well, we know it was the Democrats,
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.440]  it was the FBI and others. So they're running scared.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.040]  Well, when the Schiff hits the fan tomorrow is what it looks like is going to happen.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:10.720]  Schiff is going to be exposed and all those who try to cover this up are going to be exposed.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.400]  And you notice how they've tried to blame the Republicans for doing the very things that they
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:19.040]  do. They say the Republicans are obstructing justice when they have been steeped in obstruction of
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:23.840]  justice this entire time. They say the Republicans are lying and making things up when it's actually
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:29.120]  the Democrats and the collusion inside the former DOJ and former FBI head. They were
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.880]  making things up. They were fabricating. Hillary Clinton was destroying evidence,
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:39.920]  hammering hard drives to destroy them. These people tried to overrun America and destroy
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:44.400]  our republic. And the truth is now about to come out. And it was so close to succeeding,
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:49.200]  it finally blew up in their face. It awakened enough people to action. Absolutely. And again,
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:54.960]  as you said, Trump Trump's victory gave us a beachhead into America. From this beachhead,
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:01.280]  we now have to fight the battle for transparency and truth. And I'd say in the last last year,
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:05.920]  we got off the beachhead rolling into France. But now the Battle of the Bulges coming,
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:11.280]  the final big globalist counter assault led by Zeb Dietrich is on its way.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:16.080]  Well, absolutely. And this is why we, the people, have to continue to support this administration.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.520]  We have to support Nunez. We have to support people like Rand Paul who are demanding transparency.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:25.040]  We have to continue to call for the release of the memo because the FBI
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.400]  is right now trying to interfere with that and trying to shut it down, even as we speak.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:37.040]  And you cannot hype enough the amazing event horizon jump point historically when you enter
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:43.840]  these points that really are the brakes like in pool for the next 100, 200 years. I mean,
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.920]  every historian, every analyst agrees we have reached the critical juncture,
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.240]  really deciding the future right now. Well, this is going to break the deep state.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.520]  This is so much bigger than Watergate from all the reports that we're hearing and from reports
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.280]  like Sarah Carter, other journalists out there doing independent reporting, as well as your crew
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:06.400]  and so on. This is so much bigger than Watergate that history will have to be rewritten based on
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:13.040]  what's about to come out. It looks like tomorrow. And if the globalist media thinks they got discredited
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.280]  lying and saying Trump wouldn't win the election and the WikiLeaks and rigging the polls and rigging
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.560]  the debates, which everybody saw, that's why they lost. Trump really won by like 10, 15 points,
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:29.040]  the number show, and they stole at least five states, tried to steal others. But the avalanche,
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:36.240]  the landslide was so big that it just made it over the top. And if they think that discredited
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:41.840]  them, the economy coming back with only one year when they had us on death's doorstep and
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:46.720]  everything else is discredited to them. And now as their whole Russia gate implodes, it is the
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:53.520]  coup de gras, the final blow. This will be absolutely devastating to the Democrats in the 2018 midterms.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:59.600]  As the facts come out, there will be dozens of other investigations launched based on what's in
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:04.320]  this memo and dozens of people being indicted and going to jail. And I want to say this to you,
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.920]  I savor this not as a feeling of victory or triumph. We're still deep in the fight,
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:11.760]  but I know behind the scenes, we're not whining. We're just saying, you've been persecuted. I've
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.040]  been persecuted. A lot of our people have. And the fact, and you know, Trump has, the fact that
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:23.520]  we're winning, it makes all that pain not be pain anymore. I felt incredible pride and inspiration
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:29.120]  watching the State of the Union address. Just for once to say, we are taking America back for
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:35.360]  what it was founded on, eight years of hatred and destruction and collusion under Obama to
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:41.200]  systematically dismantle this culture, this country, this economy. And now back from the
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.840]  dead, it gives me chills. It brings turtles in my eyes because we have been so close to the enemy
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.960]  having total sway over us. Absolutely. A Soviet style purge is in all their documents. They were
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:55.200]  going to literally persecute the hell out of everybody that's decent. They're still tweeting
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.800]  in MSNBC. Don't talk about families and churches. You don't get that anymore. These are like people
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:07.200]  in a reeducation camp running it. I mean, they're so evil, Mike. You're not lying at all. You were
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.320]  on the list. I was on the list. Other websites were on the list to be shut down and taken over
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.800]  by- That's been in Congress. That's been in Congress. To have the domain seized, to have people like you
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:23.760]  and I vilified as Russian agents. You know, you did a parody on that, but that was their actual plan.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.840]  They were going to go ahead when she won with that. Absolutely. See, we're seeing the false
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.480]  launch of all this, but they're still going with the plan. They are, but their plan is now about
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.600]  to unravel at a scale that we've never seen before. And that's the danger. Just like Drake
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.400]  got everybody said, they're cornered rats right now. They're very dangerous. They're capable of
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.520]  anything at this point. Anything. A false flag operation. Anything to change the narrative. If
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:51.520]  it has to be, well, you know, a train full of Republicans slamming into a truck, that might
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.400]  have been just a small taste of things to come if they get their way. But let's hope that enough of
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.680]  the deep state has been shut down now where they can't pull off something big like a biological
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.720]  attack or a radiological attack on some city, because I have no doubt they would do anything
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.360]  to change the narrative and try to change history at this point. I agree. I know Trump likes to get
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:16.800]  peak anticipation going. He needs to move to the left, move to the right when they think he's
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.040]  moving to the right, move to the left, zig when he sags. I think he's just released it right now
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.840]  because I'm telling you, they're trying to load up federal buildings with the money. I'm nitrate
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:31.360]  right now to blame on us. They have to get the vote out of committee. I believe tomorrow morning
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.480]  and that is on track. Trump promised to get it released. It's coming. And I would say I'm going
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.800]  to be watching InfoWars tomorrow when this comes out. Man, I just tell you my gut level,
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:45.360]  though, can you feel it? The energy and you can feel they finally know they're losing. Yes. So
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.880]  right now, the whole energy's changed from that satanic narcissistic arrogance to just
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.200]  they're like demons, like pigs that are demon possessed, running off a cliff.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.280]  It's a no brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need. Period. You need a water

[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:15.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:22.160]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar. Well, the suspense is deafening. You
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:32.080]  see the horrified looks in the faces of lesal-eyed demons like Pelosi, Waters and Schiff, and just
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:36.320]  the panic in the Lepus media. They know what they did. It's already come out a lot of it.
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:43.520]  The conspiracy against the voters of this country, the massive attempts to overthrow an election,
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:50.640]  a watershed election, a political realignment. But no army can stop an idea whose time has come
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.280]  to quote Victor Hugo. But we're going to get back into that in the next segment right now,
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:04.880]  groundbreaking information dealing with the whole fiasco that we've seen the last month
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:12.960]  with tied laundry pods. And it turns out that someone sent a comedian a tweet challenging him
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:20.160]  a month and a half ago to eat one on air. He did it and now it's spread. But let's talk about,
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:29.520]  let's use some idiotic moronic craze like this to ask ourselves what's really in a tied pod.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.240]  Well, Mike Adams, who has a huge scientific lab with engineers, the whole nine yards,
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:40.320]  works for some of the biggest companies out there, has tested it. His article is at science.news.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:46.320]  We've also posted it to infowar.com. He's got all 700 chemicals listed. He's got all the different
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:53.200]  computer readouts and shots. He's got it all broken down. But just two weeks ago,
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:58.800]  Colbert and one of his many attacks on me through the character he's created that supposedly is
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:05.760]  Alex Jones is up there eating tied pods on air and telling kids to do it to protect yourself
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:12.640]  from the new world order. So here's a clip of it. It's followed up with drinking a bag of tied
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:22.000]  pods. All right. I take a little ah, ah, damn. Ready when it's made this so slippery. Anyway,
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.200]  the point is just work your way through these. They got a real kick to it. Plus,
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:33.600]  it'll make your lower testing. I mean, your duodenum will be brighter and softer than ever.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:40.800]  I think it will kill you. One of Mike. Well, we'll talk about that. You buy stamps.com.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.160]  All right. To service the sense of convicted felon, to intercept your mail so that the
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:51.520]  jackbooted government mail carriers can't push their propaganda through your letter hole. Stick
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:36:01.200]  around. We'll be right back with funny man Steven Segal. So they they're the ones pushing this and
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:06.000]  then and then I get blamed because right at the first of the segment, he says, this is Alex Jones.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.800]  Let's go to his other character, Tuck Bunford, but he plays clips of me first. Then he goes to this.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:15.280]  But no, here we are actually telling you what's in it. Do the opposite. We're saying, don't eat it.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:19.920]  Don't eat any household chemicals. Call poison control. We accidentally ingest them. We're not
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:25.600]  the ones saying it. They are Mike Adams. It is an incredible confirmation of actually your
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:30.400]  commitment to real science here to thank you for having me on. Thank you. Have this because
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:35.920]  we are an ISO accredited laboratory, which puts us above most university labs in terms of accreditation
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:41.200]  we're audited. We're inspected. We have to pass tests to be able to be accredited. We have looked
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:46.960]  at Tidepods and we've identified over 700 chemical signatures. There are actually over 1200. I
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:52.960]  removed about 500 because they didn't have high enough peaks. So there's 700 that we decided to
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:58.160]  list publicly and we've released them the chemical formulas at science.news. You can download it.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.600]  You can see for yourself. And again, tell people the name of your big lab here in Texas. Well,
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.280]  it's called CWC Labs and we do analytical science. We use mass spectrometry. We use liquid chromatography
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.720]  and our expertise is actually testing products and we test environmental samples in water and we're
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:18.960]  experts in contaminants. Contamination is our expertise. Now what we can do is we can we can
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:24.000]  show which products are clean and we can show which off-the-shelf products are actually contaminated
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.960]  both. And I remember like six, seven years ago, wasn't your idea for this? You'd try to get big
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.880]  companies to do it and they didn't even want to do it. They didn't want to test these big industry
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.080]  products because there's kind of an unwritten thing. You don't do it. Well, yeah, it's very
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:40.800]  interesting. Organizations like yours and Ed Groups are very happy to have your products tested
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.880]  and certified clean because your products are heavily tested already. You know they're clean.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:49.440]  They're quality ingredients. It's the globalist corporations that make the toxic products.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.400]  They're the ones that don't want their products tested. And you don't have the FDA
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.200]  messing with them. They can do whatever they want. That's right. That's right. So look, this is
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:02.000]  this is very good science. This is irrefutable science. We've shown the chromatography. And if
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.760]  you're a radio listener, infowars.com forward slash show, we are showing photos, video of the whole
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:12.720]  process. Please continue. Now remember that the Tide Pods package itself says that if you consume
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:19.600]  this, you should call a poison control center. So for us to say this is a toxic product is actually
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:24.960]  consistent with what the product packaging says. So I am saying yes, it's toxic. And doctors are
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:29.360]  warning all across America that if you consume this, then it could cause long term health hazard.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:34.400]  Just like fluoride toothpaste. Well, exactly. Exactly. But think about this. There's another
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:38.000]  more sinister aspect of this that brings in everything that you're talking about here at the
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.880]  show. If you bombard your senses with all these fragrance chemicals and all these toxic
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:49.360]  neurological poisons that are found in laundry products, your brain tends to recede. And you
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:54.800]  are actually, this is not a joke, you are actually less able to have cognitive adaptability in
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:59.040]  the world. Well, it's called a chemical haze. That's exactly it. It's exactly right. You,
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:05.280]  this is an assault on your ability to process information and to even think in the world
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:09.600]  correctly because you're assaulted by fluoride, you're assaulted by fragrance chemicals, you're
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.560]  assaulted by fabric softwares and dryer sheets, you're assaulted by detergents. All these chemicals
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:20.400]  bombard your brain and your neurology. And it makes it so that you cannot function at the level
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:25.200]  that you were intended to function with with your God given body, which is a supercomputer actually.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:31.520]  The dumbing down of the masses has a junk food component and a chemical component. And this
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.880]  is all part of it. So we have done the science. We have released the results. And we're now asking
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.680]  the public to look at the chemical formulas and help us identify the names of those chemicals.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:46.080]  Too many, too many formulas for us to do all the research on. These computers are so amazing.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.720]  They're telling you all these huge long names. Yeah. And you have, you found, like you said,
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:56.320]  over a thousand, but you're just cutting it down to 700. 700. It was, we only injected half of a
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:02.720]  microliter of this tied pod laundry product, half of a microliter in our system. Okay. That's one
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.520]  half of one millionth of a liter. And we found over 700 chemicals. Have you ever tested anything
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.320]  that came up this crazy? Nothing even close. Nothing even close. We have tested off the shelf
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:17.200]  products, thousands of them. We found pesticides and herbicides and other chemicals. We found
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.760]  birth control chemicals in the water supply. We did a sample from a VA hospital. We found,
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.240]  I don't know, a hundred and something chemicals in that. We've never seen 700 plus chemicals before.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:31.920]  And the message to your audience, Alex, is that if you want to protect your brain and your body
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:38.160]  and your ability to think, you need to use cleaner products, cleaner products. Exactly. And you
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:43.520]  point out, they claim there's 14 ingredients, but isn't that just like hydrofluorosalic acid?
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:48.160]  They admit is mainly out of Florida or out of Colorado at these big uranium mines,
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:52.400]  or were they mined for phosphate, or fertilizer, or from China. And it'll actually say on some of
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:57.600]  the bags from China, contains lead, mercury, arsenic, but there's waivers grandfathered in
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.080]  for water supplies to be able to put this in. And they'll certainly say, oh, we're only adding
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.040]  chlorine and we're only adding fluoride. But under the name fluoride, it could be up to 300 plus
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:11.040]  chemicals. Oh yeah, exactly. There's a lot of deception in ingredients, labels, and claims.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.200]  For example, the Procter & Gamble company says that they have only about 14
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:19.360]  ingredients in this product. They list those 14 on their website and they have nice sounding names
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:23.600]  and they say, oh, this citric acid is like from an orange, or, you know, they try to make it sound
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:30.240]  friendly. They don't tell you the other, you know, 686 chemicals that we found that have very scary
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.880]  names. And actually, if you look at what's called the material safety data sheets or MSDS sheets
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:39.600]  for these chemicals, you'll find that many of them, the vast majority, have toxic profiles.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:45.120]  My advice is you should never use tide laundry detergent, even to do your laundry.
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:49.360]  You should find something cleaner and safer. In the same way that you want to source cleaner
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.920]  products, you know, like InfoWars store, you want clean products. You should do the same thing for
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:59.200]  your laundry, for your personal care products. You are chemically polluting your family,
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:03.360]  your household. Well, ever since I was about eight years old, my mom quit using tide,
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.560]  because anytime she washed clothes in it, I would break out in hives everywhere.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.800]  That's very common, actually. It's a very common reaction. And these kids, they're eating it,
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:14.320]  you know, they think they're hip and cool. It's like, you know, this younger generation,
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.760]  they all loved Obama and they love Hillary Clinton because they don't know anything about her,
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:23.040]  but they think they're hip and cool, and they're trying to gain popularity by poisoning themselves.
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:27.040]  Now, where- That's right, because YouTube doesn't restrict any of these videos. They block,
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:30.960]  they restrict ours, but if you're making fun of dead bodies, you know, they commit suicide,
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.440]  whatever, it's fun, they push it, they force feed it to make kids nihilistic and stupid.
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:39.040]  I think they're starting to restrict it because of the outcry, and maybe with this
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.720]  segment going public, they will restrict it even more, because nobody else in America
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:46.960]  has dared publish what you had me on today to do, the 700 plus chemicals.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.960]  All right, when we come back, I'm going to give people the rest of the story behind this,

[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:35.840]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. Mike Adams is my guest in studio and
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:41.600]  from what I researched, where the hydrofluorosalic acid came from and the rest of it, at the end
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:47.040]  of World War II, they had tons of this as the byproduct from the aluminum smelting and from
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:54.240]  the production of the atomic bombs and things like that, Mike. And so they began to start putting
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:02.080]  toxic chemicals into the water supply, sheep dipped into detergents, into what we call fluoridated
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:07.120]  water, into all these other areas to get rid of the toxins and to get us to pay for them
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:11.760]  and to buy them. And then that's when we went from natural subs and natural cleaners and things
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:15.760]  that have been used for thousands of years to calling them detergents. So explain to me,
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:23.040]  not just ganging up on Proctor and Gamble, but just in general how in California,
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:29.440]  if I'm saying that I'm selling something and rutabaga has more lead in it or kale
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:34.160]  than what California says they allow, but then you can have something like Coca-Cola,
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:39.120]  where you see the studies come out, that it's full of lead, full of mercury, all this other
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:44.160]  crazy crap, and you ask yourself, how is this going on? How do they all get to do it? But then
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:49.920]  we've got something as clean as grandma's kitchen table and we're evil. I mean, how does that work?
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:54.480]  Well, let's be clear. Proctor and Gamble is not doing anything illegal. They admit their product
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.240]  is poison. There's a poison warning on the package, but it's not illegal for them to sell it, and that's
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:03.840]  why many other people sell it. But California, think about the hypocrisy of California, where they
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:08.960]  say, oh, you can't have more than 0.5 micrograms of lead in a total serving of a product. And yet,
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:16.160]  California's cities collect all of the human sludge and sewage into what's called bio sludge,
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:20.400]  and it's full of heavy metals. It's full of birth control chemicals, pharmaceuticals that
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:25.760]  were flushed down the toilet, light industrial waste, mercury from dental offices in many cases,
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:30.000]  many other poisons. They take this bio sludge and they drive it out to the countryside and they dump
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.680]  it on the countryside. So California's cities are poisoning California rural areas. That's the
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:40.080]  bio sludge issue. You had me on last time, Alex, to talk about that. That film is coming out later
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:46.960]  this year. It's going to be just a bombshell. But California poisons its own rural citizens
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:52.640]  with these bio solids and bio sludge. So for California to say, oh, you can't have 0.5 micrograms
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:59.280]  of lead in a serving is obscene, especially when that law was called the Clean Water Act or similar
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.320]  language. It was about clean water. Then they misapplied it to nutritional supplements and
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:09.360]  they gave immunity to foods. So you can go into the grocery store right now and you can buy foods
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:13.920]  that have 10 times higher level of lead. I've tested them. You could buy turmeric root. You could
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:19.920]  buy ginger root. You could buy many other products in the grocery store that have 10 times higher
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:24.400]  level of lead than what they allow in a nutritional supplement. And they call that science. I call
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.800]  that junk science. That's what California's into just like their economy is a mess. Their politics
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.760]  are a mess. Their culture is imploding. Their science is a total joke, Alex. In California,
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:39.920]  something's got to be done there. Maybe because it is a liberalism is a form of psychological warfare
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:44.720]  in their own admissions. It's in the WikiLeaks to take over and engage in criminal activity. It's
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:50.240]  like the Joker runs the Democratic Party basically. They have to dissociate you from reality. They
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:55.440]  use fake science to do it. They use fake politics. They've got Nancy Pelosi Hollywood. Yeah, Hollywood.
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:01.520]  All of the fakery like how they faked you with the laundry pods. That was a Psyop really. It wasn't
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:06.560]  just a satire. It was a Psyop to try to associate you with the poison of the tide laundry. And I've
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:11.520]  noticed it's an underwriting deal because every time Colbert attacks me or the other shows,
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:16.000]  they make fun of me saying, there's chemicals in the food and water that are bad for you.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:22.080]  And there's no such thing as the gay frogs. And then they now go out and show me taking
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:26.480]  chemicals on air. So again, they do not want a real sensible debate about this. Exactly. The key
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:32.080]  to this is they are really trying to cover it up. I go to science shows. I go like ASMS. I have
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:37.120]  science posters at the shows. One of my science articles in the journal LCGC was one of the top
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:42.320]  six articles of the year in liquid chromatography journal. I go to science shows and the people
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:47.280]  there talk to me about atrazine in the same way that you talked about atrazine. What you are
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:53.120]  saying is scientifically valid. It's 100% true. And the people who are attacking you over atrazine
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:58.320]  are fake science. And they know and the thing is they've got a talking point. It's everywhere.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:02.640]  They're like, don't listen to him. The water is great. GMOs great. Tide pods, wonderful.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:07.520]  Yeah, but it's funny because you have also the extreme environmentalists in places like California
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:12.160]  who say, well, you know, watch out for glyphosate, right? And they're saying, watch out for GMOs.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:16.880]  And then they say, what, atrazine is a hoax? What's wrong with these people? They're living a
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:21.360]  contradiction and you are pointing out the good science. In fact, I would say like today,
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:28.400]  the tide pods show that is a really a pro protect your health, protect our planet message
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:33.440]  here on Infowars. You are about protecting health. You are about protecting the planet.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:37.040]  And they are about well, I appreciate you saying the kind words. I'm just for not
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:42.960]  living in a death cult kamikaze society with all these crazy nihilists that think this is all funny.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.880]  No, and they want to say that climate change is the problem, that carbon dioxide is a pollutant,
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:54.560]  which is a scientific hoax. All the plants, all the forests need carbon dioxide to flourish.
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:58.320]  Without carbon dioxide, we couldn't grow food. Carbon dioxide, we just did a science article
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:03.840]  on this, Alex. Carbon dioxide is causing a wave of flowers to bloom in the rainforest all across
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:08.240]  the world because the levels are slightly higher. Carbon dioxide is beautiful. Carbon dioxide.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.120]  I was about to say all the climatologists and all the forest experts and everybody that study it
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.200]  said that when it was hundreds of times higher, it's now just a trace gas that trees grew way,
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.440]  way faster. There was more oxygen. Everybody was healthier. Yes. The planet was more green
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:25.680]  when we had more carbon dioxide. In fact, they say a major study is the Sahara they believe
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:31.040]  has been growing because of low CO2 levels. Well, exactly. Think about under Obama, the EPA
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:37.680]  under Obama declared carbon dioxide to be a pollutant. This is the gas of life for plants.
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:42.640]  This is nutrition for plants. It's like oxygen. Carbon cycle. And they called it a pollutant.
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:47.360]  If you were aliens that want to destroy life on earth, you would cut the CO2.
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:52.480]  The EPA has been accused of pursuing an almost terraforming type of activity. And you notice
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:56.240]  now they're admitting that geoengineering is real because the science is coming out that says once
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:00.720]  you start geoengineering, if you stop it, there will be catastrophic consequences to the planet
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:04.000]  because they've already started it. Yeah, of course they've started it. And now they're admitting it.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.400]  Remember two years ago, everybody was called a kook for say, oh, geoengineering, it's a conspiracy
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:12.160]  theory. They were making fun of everybody, right? Now they admit, oh, yeah, it's been happening.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:17.520]  Just like globalism. Amazing. naturalnews.com. You name it. By the way, it's not just you. Fortune,
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:22.880]  commentary. It's time to ban tide pods for good. And it goes on to say it's toxic. It's dangerous.
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:27.040]  It's concentrated. It explodes in your mouth. What in the earth are we doing here? That's even
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:32.080]  fortune. So it just goes on and on. Look, I don't know if they can show this picture, but
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:37.920]  tide pods are engineered, Alex, to resemble food. And children are brainwashed into thinking
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:41.120]  because they want you to think it's healthy. It's all designed. That's right. They think foods
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.760]  are artificial. They think food comes in a part of a brainwashing operation. They are disconnecting
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:50.560]  everybody from reality. Real food comes out of a garden. Real food comes from the earth, right?
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:55.120]  Real food. By the way, what? I've never seen a molecule that's a perfect swastika. What? That's
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:59.680]  a swastika molecule. It's in tide pods. It's just a coincidence. I mean, there's, I'm not saying
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.640]  like, well, obviously it's just that I've, I mean, I've looked at so many molecules before,
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:06.320]  never seen one that looks like that. Yeah. Well, I've got all the chromatography here. I show
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:11.440]  you the peaks. I show you the retention times, the accurate masses. This is a combination. By the
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:15.120]  way, I don't know how expensive this is because we get all our stuff tested too by top labs. And
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:19.920]  oh, yeah, thousands of dollars per test. Yeah, yeah. This run, if a private lab were to charge for
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:25.600]  this, it'd be a couple thousand dollars. We spent that instrument alone is about $400,000. And just
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.200]  the up, that's great. I'm building big studios and hiring TV crews and fighting that way. And
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.560]  you're fighting building the big lab. I know our lab is expanding. We're getting another
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:36.080]  great job coming in. Thank you, man. Mike Adams here with us. He's gonna tell you almost a little bit
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:40.320]  in the next hour that I'm gonna open the phones up, take your calls. They're now Reuters is reporting
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:44.640]  that Fox News sources have talked to the president and that he's going to release the memo tomorrow
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.720]  morning. They want to let the Senate Intelligence Committee look at it one more time. But we'll
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.800]  see it's a rapidly changing situation. Briefly, speaking of funding operations, you're changing
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:57.920]  the world at infoworksstore.com. We now have the new shirt of the month. The second new shirt is
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:02.960]  out. It's limited edition. You can cancel any time and get each month shirt and get 20% off
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:07.040]  when you're signed up for it. The new one is Trump 2020 with sunglasses looking forward to the
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:12.640]  future with Trump on it. I think this is going to be a bestseller. Also, we're about to end the
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:19.760]  sale of $50 off on the Alexa Pure Breeze four stage ion filter. Nobody has one of this quality
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:27.040]  even near this price of $149. It's a great deal normally at 200. Also, pollen block is a total
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:33.120]  natural system, especially fed Japanese quail for some reason is how it works in France. They're
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:39.040]  fed a special secret diet and it's known to have natural compounds on it that have a huge effect
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:45.040]  with seasonal discomfort, the dust, all the rest of the garbage with the sinuses. When I forget
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:49.840]  to take it when my allergies are really, really flared up, I personally noticed the difference.
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:56.240]  It's amazing. So 50% off right now out of the gates. It's really 1776. So that's 51% off technically.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:02.080]  Pollen block, that special is about to end because that's selling out. Also, we've got 50% off on
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:08.000]  cell force. It's really going to be DNA force plus. There's more bio PQQ, more CoQ10,
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.160]  nerve regrowth factor, help flush the toxins out of the cells, all of it. It's amazing. Nothing is
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:20.400]  close to this in price. Other leading brands are $200, $300. We have it right now for $70.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:25.040]  We're putting like 30 something dollars in each bottle of this baby. Other folks just
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:30.160]  marked us up seven times. We don't do it. And it's the real bio available forms of all of this,
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:35.120]  not synthetic crap that people pay more for and doesn't even get absorbed show. Cell force will
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:40.480]  be DNA force plus. But again, if you want it, it's about to sell out. That supports the broadcast
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:45.760]  infowarstore.com. Commit to support us and we'll continue fighting. Stay with us. Our number three
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.160]  info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found extraordinary
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:57.360]  new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:02.400]  nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:07.680]  This is pollen block. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:13.600]  quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose,
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:18.960]  itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production that against studying the effects
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:23.920]  in published trials in their public trials. Now we are introducing the fruit of the research of
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:30.160]  fast acting chewable tablet, just two two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:35.840]  acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:40.080]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast acting pollen block available now
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:51.040]  at infowarslife.com or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:55.760]  Oh Alex, you can rent any day of the week. Thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:01.680]  and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:08.400]  areas as well. And as a long time info wars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:13.760]  brain force anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the anthroplex. Thank you. I use
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:18.560]  the bio true selenium the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:23.840]  The super blue is awesome. And thank you so much Alex for the info wars life products. They are
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:29.360]  quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:35.760]  Absolutely. Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:40.800]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on. And if we can get our houses in order and be
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:54.160]  good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:54.160 --> 02:00:08.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:15.600]  Coming up, I'm going to give you my review of Elon Musk flamethrower. I just heard the hype
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:18.880]  and said get me a couple of minutes about to sell out by the time I did it was back order.
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:23.520]  Then I did some flame flora research. I'm a fan of Elon Musk, but I'm not a fan of this
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:28.640]  flamethrower. Wait till we give you some comparisons, especially for TV viewers coming up about 15,
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:34.080]  20 minutes. Mike Adams had a great idea during the break. Again, the health ranger here with us
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:41.760]  at science.news. Mike, if people just joined us, you have exclusively tested these Tide pods that
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:47.200]  people are gobbling and getting high off of. I guess toxins do that. Again, Tide can legally sit
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:52.000]  here and sell these toxins. And they say it's a toxin on the back. They lie and tell you there's
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.560]  only 14 ingredients, but clearly those ingredients have subgroups in them, just like with a fluoride.
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:00.560]  It's hundreds of toxins being dumped in our water. We have a right to expose this, but you had a great
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:04.320]  idea because during the break, one of the crew walked in and said, hey, what are solutions to
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:09.440]  this? You said, yes, you should come out with your own detergent. And by the way, this is completely
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:13.440]  spontaneous. This wasn't preplanned, but you should come out with your own detergent,
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:18.720]  we'll test it in our lab and certify the ingredients with you. You should offer that to
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.200]  your people. Now it's kind of heavy. It's heavier to ship than your supplements. So if you offer
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:26.880]  free shipping, you might have to adjust the price accordingly. But frankly, you should give people
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.880]  alternatives. I mean, well, I already use all the certified organic stuff and so we should just
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:34.160]  clone that. Then the listeners can support the broadcast and know they're getting a good one as
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:40.160]  well. But here's the deal. The last 20 years, I'm no health expert like you, but I know my eyes
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:44.160]  are burning on the chemical aisle. If I was cleaning the house with chemicals, I would get sick. My
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:48.880]  hands would fall apart and it leaves stuff on the glasses. Well, this stuff's all crap. The
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:52.800]  natural stuff's cheaper and works better. You don't need all these chemicals to clean your
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:58.080]  laundry. You really don't. You just need some more natural detergents. You don't need all the UV
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:03.440]  altering or blocking the wavelength blocking chemicals that they use to quote, whiteen
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:07.200]  the clothes. You don't need the fragrance chemicals for sure, because the fragrance chemicals is
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:10.880]  really what sets a lot. That's another thing. Detergents eat you. The chemical ones eat your
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.760]  clothes. Many of them do. But more importantly, think about it. If you saturate your clothing
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:20.160]  in those chemicals and then you wear them and then you go to the gym, you sweat. You sweat.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:25.120]  Well, that's what happens when you drink water and salt. When I was eight years old, my mom stopped
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:29.120]  buying dye because I would break out in hives. Because the chemicals are getting released from
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.120]  the clothing into your skin as you're going through your workout or just through your day. If you're
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:37.280]  sweating, you know, maybe your armpits are sweating and you're releasing and then reabsorbing into
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:42.080]  your armpits, these chemicals. This is true. This is straight science and biology. This is how it
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:49.840]  works. So I think you should offer a clean, non-toxic detergent product to your customer base.
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:52.880]  And you can do it at a great value because you're not going through retail. So you don't have to
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.840]  have the two. That's a great idea. That's a great idea. In fact, Tim Frosier has talked about that
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:01.760]  before. We've never just done it because I mean, now again, everything we already do is what we
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:06.480]  then get the listeners to support us, to support them. Yeah. So we build a base to be able to
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:11.760]  have this economy to even resist the globalist, which Trump understands. He is trying to bring
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:15.600]  the economy back and it's happening. And that's why your products represent such a good value
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:19.440]  because you don't go into retail. You know, we've looked at going into retail too. You know, they
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.560]  have to charge. I mean, you have to have like a 200 or 250 or 300% markup. So you have to cheapen
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:29.920]  the ingredients to end up in the retail store. And that's why there'll be like $1 in a product
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:36.240]  that's 30 bucks. Exactly. We put $35 in something that's 70. Right. Because you sell direct.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.680]  So your customers... I mean, the top labs we have making it just go,
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:43.840]  this is incredible. I mean, no one's putting this much stuff in their product. I know,
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:47.360]  I've had these conversations privately with Ed Group and, you know, we talk about ingredients
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:51.520]  and everything. And it's so impressive to me because I know the cost of some of these ingredients,
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:55.920]  like the PQQ and some of the others, you know, expensive that stuff is or the methylcobalamine
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:59.840]  form of B12, you know, expensive that. I mean, that's like when BuzzFeed tested our stuff.
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:04.560]  Mainly expensive. They said, okay, it's pure B12, like they say, but this is really the top brand
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:08.160]  in the company, according to their lab. And it was Groups that I private label. Right. So they
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.480]  said Groups is the best in the country. And they didn't even know it was Groups. They lie about
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:16.400]  your products the same way they lie about the economy the same way they lie. And they lie so
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:21.920]  bad they end up telling the truth. I know. It's totally insane. But see, we've got real science
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:26.000]  on our side. Now we can go head to head with anybody that makes a false claim against your
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.200]  company or my company. Well, you did that with K-man. You tested it and it wasn't true. That's
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:32.960]  right. That's right. We exposed the fake science that was being used to try to target you. Well,
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:37.200]  that's the thing. You know, it passes with our labs. It passes with other labs. They test it and
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:42.560]  pass this open thing. And magically, you know, they're not going to let us. I tested your product
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:47.920]  five times. And it was super clean all five times, by the way, five times, just to be sure. There you
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.960]  go. But they don't care. They'll have somebody hold the lab magically. You know, says, you know,
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:05:01.280]  yeah, PCP in it. We'll be right back. Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life. Cell Force focuses
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:07.360]  on mitochondria efficiency and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:12.000]  They are your body's cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.280]  energy production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:22.960]  when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:28.720]  species. Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:34.720]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:39.520]  of the most powerful available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:46.160]  ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect,
[02:05:46.160 --> 02:06:00.000]  and adapt with Cell Force from Info Wars Life. Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:25.360]  Well, I gotta say, Mike Adams is on fire. And he's with us for one more segment
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:28.960]  that I'm going to get into all the news, Trump's speech today, the State of the Union,
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:33.280]  the globalist on his strike back. But during the breaks, we've been really talking about
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:39.040]  the globalist, how they operate, what they've been doing before. This is the time they want to pull
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:44.400]  a false flag. This is the time that they would stage something to not just distract from the memo,
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:50.800]  but make themselves the victim. And they had Michael Hastings, it was clearly an operative
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:54.080]  for the government, but a good guy who was car blew up after he said, I'm going public,
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:59.200]  it's pure evil, when he discovered what Obama was doing. His wife, who was with the top advisor,
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.320]  that is top gopher on the National Security Council for Obama, she came out and said,
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:10.560]  oh, total natural causes on CNN. Well, she's come out, first she said she'd take down whoever did
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:15.520]  it, that she changed her story and said, there's going to be massacres in America if you publish
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:21.040]  this. And so again, I'm not saying she's even privy to the plan, but this is clearly a message
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:24.880]  when Phil mud of the CIA and stuff says, we're going to kill the president, they're sending out
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:28.880]  a message to sound strong to their stay behind networks in the government. So you've you've
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:33.600]  been on fire on air, but off air, recap, you've been saying about the only card they've got
[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:38.640]  to false flag right now, and we've got to absolutely be vigilant watching all of our
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:42.480]  sixes and media matters and others made a joke going, doesn't he get your sixes right behind
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:46.880]  you? There's only one. No, there's never only one backdoor watch your ass. There's lots of ways
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:50.880]  to watch your butt. I have many sixes that everybody else, we all have a bunch of sixes
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:54.880]  together. So they play these semantical games. The left always does that like they're the big
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:08:00.160]  grammar masters and we're all a bunch of English nincompoops. Well, these nincompoops just brought
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:04.400]  the country back and just turned it all around. So shove that in your Keester globalist. But
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:08.480]  but seriously, we should all be watching all our sixes. They have reached a level of desperation
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:15.280]  that we can only call sociopathic at this point. The the unhinged depths of what the left has now
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:20.240]  come to. I think Michelle Obama said today all they have left is hope. That's true because their
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:26.320]  lies are being exposed. Their their false promises are being exposed. Their destruction of America,
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:32.160]  the systematic disassembly of this culture of this nation of this economy is being exposed
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:38.160]  every single day by our president and by certain Republicans such as Nunez and Rand Paul as I
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:42.560]  mentioned before. I would say to every member of Congress who who might be watching this,
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:47.840]  watch your back for the next few days for the next few weeks because you are in a danger zone
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:52.720]  right now just like they try to take out Scalise and the entire leadership of the Patriots and
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:57.360]  they failed. So I think Congress is watching and I think moves like that have now made them be more
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:03.280]  hardcore Patriots. Well, absolutely. I mean, many people in Congress now are talking the way that
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:08.480]  you would have heard here on Info Wars four years ago, five years ago, which was called fringe by
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:12.640]  some people. Now it's mainstream because the truth is coming out. The deep state is so corrupt,
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:16.400]  the shadow government might be a better term. And of course, the left is making fun of that and
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:19.760]  saying, oh, what deep state? There's no shadow government. That's insane. Well, the two go hand
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:24.240]  in glove. The deep state or the criminal stay behind networks in the shadow government that's
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:29.440]  always been there, especially since nuclear war threats under COG. So the shadow government is
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:34.880]  a fact. They just think the public's ignorant. The deep state is the criminal elements that operate
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:39.840]  outside of the rule of law and the will of people. Well, of course they do. And they're desperate to
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.560]  maintain control at this point. And let me be clear, Alex, they do not care how many innocent
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:50.400]  people they have to perhaps injure or kill in order to maintain their power and change the narrative.
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:54.240]  And look at the history, the pattern of the Clintons. Remember backward, Bill Clinton was
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:59.280]  president when the Monica Lewinsky scandal came out, thanks to Drudge. What did he do? He had
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:05.200]  an aspirin factory bombed in Somalia, I believe, wasn't it? Somalia. Sudan. Sudan. In order to
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:11.120]  change the narrative, they released bad news on New Year's Eve where they have Obama sign
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:15.760]  some new police state law on New Year's Eve. They do everything in the dark. They're all about
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:20.560]  hiding things and they're all about covert operations. On New Year's Eve, he put the thing
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:25.280]  in to federalize all the elections. Exactly. Exactly. And he also retroactively then signed
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:30.560]  laws to allow the FBI and the DOJ to share intelligence with other agencies. To leak it
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:37.520]  to the press. Yes. Trump is bringing a new level of light of transparency. Trump is working to
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:45.680]  protect life, actual life to protect Americans, to protect our republic. We owe Trump and his team
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:49.760]  our support at levels that we've never seen before. And you know, I like the fact that they're
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:52.960]  trying to bully everybody to not support the president. So people that are really supporters
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:58.400]  kind of hedge their bets. I am proud of it in public. I say it. I hold my head up because
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:02.640]  imagine what the president's going through and you know a man by his enemies. The globalists
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:07.760]  are super bad news. My only problem with Trump is, and it's a big one, is he has been manipulated
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:12.640]  and bullied and the military stuff is so complex. We know he's not aware of some of it.
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:18.560]  Into going after Russia, pushing Russia, sorrows, fun of the overthrow of Ukraine. Now we're
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:24.240]  sending heavy weapons in, more sanctions against Russia, calling anybody who's wealthy over there,
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:28.560]  building their country up in oligarch. I mean, Trump, you know, in trying to prove he's not a
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:32.240]  Russian agent, has basically walked right up to the Russians and kicked them right in the face.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:36.880]  And I'm really worried about it. Well, there are, of course, factions inside the Pentagon.
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:40.960]  There are factions inside the deep state and different factions, essentially tribalism inside
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:45.680]  the shadow government, are vying for position and power. And the number one thing they don't
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:50.960]  want to lose is the ability to spy on Americans for political reasons. And that's why this FISA
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:57.040]  memo coming out is going to be absolutely a bombshell. And you know that by how scared they
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:01.280]  are. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, because they've gone from laughing to like, they're like, don't
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:05.280]  do it. No, it's horrible because they know what they did. They're calling it treason. If it comes
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:10.000]  out, they're saying, there was a, someone said they were going to have Nunez arrested and charged
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.760]  with crimes. I mean, it was, it was nonsense. They're saying he's a Russian agent. Yeah,
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:18.480]  now he's a Russian agent. And you're a Russian agent. And Trump is, I mean, it's, it's, it's
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:23.840]  so ridiculous. But the lies are going to be exposed. And America, there's my visa. I just got
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:27.280]  to go to Russia though. I saw that. That's, that's, I'm just throwing on their face, man. I know you
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:31.840]  are. They're not bullying me. Are you even, that's, that's hilarious. Are you actually going there?
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:36.960]  Yeah. Yeah, just, you get a secret Russian meeting right there. That's good stuff. No, I mean,
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:41.280]  it actually makes me fascinated with Russia because I never really thought about going to Russia.
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:46.720]  And now it's like fascinating to be told, this is my boss and it's just total horseman. Yeah,
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:50.480]  of course. Well, those of us who have been persecuted by the media, like you and I and
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:55.200]  Trump and others, we know the dirty games they play against us. We know how much they lie. We
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:59.920]  know how much they, they fact, notice how Trump's been bullied into never meeting alone with Putin
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:04.000]  when he's met all the other major world leaders alone. I mean, our president is that we elected
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.240]  him. He's ahead of state. He could go sign a treaty with Putin if he wanted to. Well, that's the
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.480]  thing. I mean, talking to the Russians, they got nuclear weapons. We better be doing it.
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:18.480]  You must talk to the Russians if you are ahead of your, your nation. If you're a secretary of
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:22.080]  state, if you're the president, you have to be dereliction of duty. If you want, of course it
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:27.280]  would be, but they try to say that any communication with the Russians is treason that, that everything's
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:31.120]  rigged. You know, who's been rigging the elections for all these years as the Democrats, people voting
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:35.120]  who aren't sitting. And you know who is trying to bring in a Soviet style deal and who's, and, and
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:39.360]  whose liberal grandparents are on record. Liberal leftists out of the US, a lot of them have been
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:44.400]  Russian immigrants. They went back and took Russia over. Yeah. American leftists had had their
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:50.080]  foot on the neck of Russia for 85 years and they're pissed now that what, I mean, Bernie Sanders had
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:55.280]  his honeymoon there. All of them. These people loved it when it was a place to kill Christians
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:59.760]  and enslave people. But now, oh my gosh, it's out of their grasp just like America and they're
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.960]  crapping all over themselves. Look at the history of, of communist revolutions. They first have the,
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:10.240]  the narrative, they have the language and they get the hatred riled up in the population. And then
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:14.320]  they, they do the kinetic overthrow attempt. Now the second amendment is going to stop them in this
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:18.400]  country. But look at what Michael Moore just, we were right up to the kinetic operation. Hillary
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:22.880]  was going to beach at it and then they had strong cities, UN backing and they were really going to
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:26.800]  try it. They were going to try it. I say there might be, if they ever try that, there's going to be
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:30.400]  what I call second amendment activation. It came out the documents. That's why finally a lot of
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:36.320]  people, the CIA, the Pentagon, the FBI suddenly got on the Patriot side and realized it was all true.
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.680]  And now that's why it's game over. Because even if they kill Trump and us, they're never going to
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.360]  get away with this now. But they're too stupid to realize that. They're going to try it anyway,
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.440]  even though it's suicide for them. Look, get back to what Michael Moore said. It sounded like he
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:51.840]  was calling for ethnic cleansing of all white people the other day, that day before the State
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:56.240]  of the Union. He said the problem's white people just like Oprah Winfrey. Exactly. And they said
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:02.000]  they have to overthrow the system that gave us Trump. That those are that's the country code
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.400]  words. That's for a communist revolution. Can you imagine if you're a minority? Most of them are
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:10.400]  great people. Because most of us is weird white leftist running things. And you just keep hearing
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:14.320]  kill the white people overthrow them. They're the problem America sucks. And Trump's like unity.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:20.960]  We love you. We're turning the jobs back on screw you. Then some evil demon goblin creature is,
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:25.120]  you know, out there trying to foment war on white people. I just say every Patriot out there,
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:31.200]  be safe, be prepared, follow the law, support a lawful society, but be ready in case they try
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.920]  something insane. And if they go on an offensive against us, the best defense is a good offense.
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:39.280]  If they strike or trying to round people up or whatever, if they kill the president, folks,
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:42.800]  you understand what you have to do. You know who the enemies are. They're going to try to play us
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:48.000]  off against the police, go around the police and deal with the enemy at point blank range. We'll
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:54.160]  be back. Great job, Mike Adams. Amazing. North Ranger, national news dot com.

[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:02.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:13.520]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones watch man
[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:18.960]  watch man my democrat colleagues didn't want us to find this information that they did everything
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:23.360]  they could to keep us from finding this information so of course they don't want to be embarrassing to
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:28.960]  them um i think it'll be embarrassing to adam schiff once people realize the extent to which
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:34.880]  he went to keep them from learning any of this so that that would be the embarrassment go ahead what
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:43.040]  do you mean uh i mean going to court to to to uh help fusion gps so we can't find out that they
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:50.080]  paid for the for the dossier and that they were working for the dnc um that's a pretty big step
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:54.560]  to go to court to try to keep the american people from learning something so look if it were up to
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:57.760]  adam schiff you wouldn't know about hillary clinton's email you wouldn't know about the
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:03.120]  server you wouldn't know who paid for the dossier so i do find it ironic that he has his own memo
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:06.880]  now because if he were up to him we wouldn't know any of them aren't we all in search of the truth
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:12.080]  though i mean democrats and republicans should be in search of the truth if there are a few bad apples
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:17.680]  they need to get out but why is this such a partisan issue when if something wrong happened
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:21.760]  we need to get to the bottom of it figure out who's responsible and then there need to be
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:27.120]  consequences but why did the democrats have a problem with that i don't know ansley uh my old
[02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:31.600]  job it was about the pursuit of the truth this job it is about winning um and i think that's
[02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:36.560]  what frustrates people and that's how you get a seven percent public approval rating yeah um i
[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:43.280]  want to know i i voted to let the democrat memo um see the light yeah when it goes to it i i i trust
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:49.120]  people to make up their own mind and draw fair conclusions but politics has uh denigrated to
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:53.360]  the point that it's about winning and it's about embarrassing the other side and and again that's
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:58.160]  how you get a seven percent public approval right so so ultimately uh tray gatti what are the
[02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:02.560]  questions that tray gatti when the cameras are off and you're talking to your buddies that you need
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:07.600]  answered that you pretty much don't know but you think you're in the pursuit of well my main
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:12.480]  interest is the integrity of the doj and the fbi so if the cameras were off i would ask my friends
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:18.240]  at the bureau and the department um how pervasive was the bias i see struck and page but but i want
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:23.360]  to believe that out of the 30 000 employees just those two i want to believe that i got a texas
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:28.480]  morning from an fbi agent who's a friend of mine and and of course morale is low uh the democrats
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:34.080]  blame us for that i think morale is low because most people in this country hear the name struck
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:38.480]  and page and they associate that with the fbi i i'm just telling them that is not the fbi that
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:43.680]  i ever worked with and i want to know what the department this bruce or angle the number four
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:49.920]  person that no federal prosecutor that i ever worked with would do the things that bruce or did
[02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:54.320]  so that's what i hope his wife works for fusion gps that might be an indication yeah tray one
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:23:00.320]  other name um andrew mccabe were you surprised that he got removed yesterday i was uh i spent
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:04.880]  the better part of two days interviewing him on house intel and then judiciary the next day
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:09.440]  he was a really professional witness he answered all of our questions we were together for about
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:15.200]  20 hours i guess total um i don't know why he left and it wouldn't be fair to him for me to
[02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:22.320]  speculate um so i i am grateful for his service um but he's a really important witness and both
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:27.440]  the clinton and russia and uh we'll leave it there all right uh thanks for yes sir thanks for
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:32.720]  anything to get out of here appreciate it game cox or climson oh on television or not on television
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:43.040]  i had a kid at one of the most schools let me boil it down real simple the fbi is threatening
[02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:48.960]  the president of the united states how so well you know they're gonna come out first of all they've
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:55.840]  tried to put him in a corner and say hey look we really don't want you revealing all the criminality
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:02.320]  that's going on in the organization and so they're in a very uh reactive sort of posture
[02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:07.680]  and so they they broker a meeting with the chief of staff who's the wrong person to meet with first
[02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:13.360]  of all yeah i would think it and then secondly even after this supposed negotiation where that
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:20.560]  where the white house gave up its its power gave up its position of authority they acquiesced to a
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:26.000]  meeting which never should have happened with five negotiators who i'm sure you know call themselves
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:33.600]  experts you know cautioning and warning and oh you know uh general uh general kelly this will be
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:39.600]  a grave problem they they try to intimidate in order to cover up for their criminality
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:44.480]  and then when they're all done they still come out with a statement what was the last time the fbi
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:50.320]  came out with a statement on anything lou yeah well it's a great point because they haven't i
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:55.760]  still haven't seen the Benghazi report i still have yet we can go through the list yeah the fbi
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:02.720]  has been a place where truth goes to die and where they're used primarily to cover up it's
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:07.440]  under fbi investigation we can't answer your questions we'll never see you again thank you very
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:13.280]  much and so these political operators are threatening the president of the united states
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:20.080]  they're betraying the oath to the constitution they are so defensive and so reactive trying to
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:25.760]  cover up for the big fbi machine which has ed rollins pointed out before that frankly has a
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:30.240]  long history of all sorts of different flavors of corruption that's powerful that's the director of
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:36.240]  investigations for judicial watch that full video is up on info wars dot com it's like 15 minutes long
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:43.200]  very powerful and we've caught them in this criminal political operation to overthrow
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:47.280]  the elections that's treason that's authoritarian they're desperate down to stop the memo from
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:53.600]  coming out they've got hashtag hunt republicans they're shooting uh mayors and city council people
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:59.040]  and fathers and mothers that are conservative and libertarian they're calling for the overthrow
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:03.360]  of white people michael more is uh they're calling for the death of the president all over the place
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:08.240]  and i'm saying if they kill the president and they're trying to have mass arrest of american
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:14.480]  citizens that was in obama's 2010 document that got leaked to us in 2012 that the army
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:19.120]  confirmed was real where they said we're going to process citizens in the reeducation camps they
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:24.320]  use the soviet term and we're going to put the political troublemakers mainly men in special
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:31.200]  camps and then hillary talked about fun camps for men and they're actually thinking about
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:37.680]  this and people go oh you're against the military no i'm against our military being seized to be
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:44.160]  prepared to be used for this it's the globalists that hate the military and hate the men and women
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:48.560]  in the military there are a lot of great people in the military there's also small percentage
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:52.240]  that you know get in just for political reasons or whatever especially in the officer class but
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:56.400]  i've never said the military is the problem or the police i've said they want to start a civil
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:00.720]  war where they play the left off against the police to knock out local government make them
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:05.040]  capitulate to bring in the strong city's initiative run by the u n that was all announced two years
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:12.720]  ago you can't make this up you cannot make this stuff up and they were really going to try it
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:17.600]  once hillary got in they were going to keep going this race riot narrative and all the police are
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:23.120]  racist and evil and uh it didn't matter what the facts showed just keep hyping things to local
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:29.360]  government ran up a white flag and put sjw is in as the police so if they still start a civil war
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:36.720]  and start shooting and killing people i'm calling for peace i'm calling for not being played off
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:41.120]  against the police a lot of which are probably going to follow illegal orders at least in the
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:44.480]  first wave of this thing if it goes south i don't think it is now we're pulling out of this right
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:48.320]  now we're pulling away from it we're really getting out of these dangerous waters but we're far from
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:52.880]  being out of them we've just turned the tide we're going the right direction we've turned away from
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:59.040]  the reef right now from the rocks just barely but there are other issues and other problems out there
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:05.280]  and it is just an incredible time to be alive so we need to be politically at point blank range
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:11.280]  not violently but politically at point blank range in their faces at their events letting
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:14.720]  them know that we're not bullied we're not intimidated we're going to go out everywhere

[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:37.760]  with sjw's and hollywood the nfl promoting antifa they are in a full attempt to still bully us and

[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:18.800]  and he's been calling us for about a year with really interesting information and then the last
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:23.520]  six months with stunning information just as a citizen analyst about what really happened
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:28.960]  in vegas what's happened to their events and it's been beyond q anon with what he said he's been
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:35.040]  picked up once by the fbi taken into the military base uh in florida for questioning uh another time
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:42.080]  visited by the fbi over what he says on this show and right now he's saying super bowl this weekend
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:48.960]  intel on planned false flags on the super bowl in a little mogadishu that's what uh minneapolis

[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:21.120]  release tonight but the fbi freaked out now they're talking about releasing it tomorrow morning
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:28.560]  i've just been saying as a lay researcher but we are in false flag card area because it seems
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:36.400]  that's all they've got and cnn is now reporting that fbi director ray may resign uh if the memo
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:40.480]  is released so they were all threatening trump don't you dare ever fire us another saying we'll

[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:41.200]  was just driving me crazy during the state of the union please so um trump did bring up the state of
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:45.600]  the union for several reasons the most important from my perspective have nothing to do with
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:50.080]  immigration i mean it does have to do with that but um so this is these are the two words that
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:54.000]  are going to bring it all down and you know we have amnesia as a public there's so much going on but
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:59.360]  i don't have the amnesia because i saw it with my own eyes let's bring up operation cast away
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:04.880]  all you researchers at home you guys there at info wars bring up operation cast away
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:09.920]  operation cast away was the sister program the fasten furious it happened before this is the
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:16.720]  400 million laundered through acovia these are the tampa atf agents running the guns to columbia
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:23.520]  to honduras to porto rico eventually making their way to isis all under the holder in obama doj
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:29.360]  and who do they run those through ms-13 you bet you and uh this was reported it kind of got swept
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:35.280]  on the rug uh fasten furious kind of took you know you know took the steam away from it but this in
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:44.000]  particular involves ms-13 so this idea that this is a little gang that nobody knows about no ms-13
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:51.680]  is ms mbc and make no mistake ms-13 is isis literally those guns went to create isis were
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:56.240]  used on the ground to fight against armed our armed forces those are the same guns were in
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:01.520]  the hotel in vegas those are the same guns using false flags against americans those are the same
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:07.360]  guns to attack your second fourth amendment so yeah ms-13 is a pretty big deal you got
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:14.160]  operation cast away you got fasten furious this is all under a corrupt doj with holder in obama
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:18.960]  leading it so let's not have amnesia about this little game yes there's in the bottom line from
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:23.920]  the the marine corps kernels we've had on everybody else our congressional sources ms-13
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:31.520]  was used by obama and their breakaway groups in the cia uh their shadow cia as their foot soldiers
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:36.240]  to carry out killings to carry out money laundering to carry out operations not just here but
[02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:42.080]  transnationally including has now been documented obama ordered the hezbollah and hamas uh
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:48.480]  investigations shut down of them linked up with ms-13 trafficking in arms and sex slaves here in
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:55.520]  the u.s to black op fund obama's uh resupplying operations for al-qaeda and isis in north africa
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:00.720]  and into syria you bet you and yeah that's official i mean hits on government officials
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:05.760]  400 million dollars laundered these are the guns that created isis and made it happen
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:10.720]  and this idea that oh this is just some gang doesn't represent immigrants you know there
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:14.720]  were there were that that that that speech that state of the union was probably the most critical
[02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:20.160]  moment i've ever witnessed in my time on this planet and uh it that was the stamp of um the
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:24.320]  second american revolution make no mistake and notice he he he quoted and he started talking
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:29.200]  about guantanamo bay i think we need to keep it open and he and he followed up by talking about
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:34.720]  this term which we'll start to hear in the next few months enemy combatants enemy combatants
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:38.640]  why are we going to keep that open i noticed how he looked at the democrats when he talked about that
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:44.880]  oh you bet you're funded you're you ran these guns under operation castaway under fast and furious
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:49.040]  that went to the border that made their way you know to create isis to you know to to
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:53.760]  essentially kill us soldiers you know kill citizens in our own country look at vegas look at
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:57.760]  everything you're complicit you knew what was going on don't don't give me the stuff about you
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:02.000]  know this is just uh something that went wrong this is deep and this is important the ms-13
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:06.320]  connection there's a reason he brought it up and that was it that's the guantanamo bay connection
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:10.240]  um we could get a little bit more into that but i know your time's limited i have to get
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:15.600]  into the false flags because um obviously the train attack was a false flag and i mean
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:20.080]  this is going to come out in the next couple days but look you know the type of individuals that
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:24.320]  were on that train i mean this wasn't just you know your everyday passenger this is the highest
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:30.720]  value target this is house gop members heading to a summit at greenbrier okay they're heading to
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.760]  a summit greenbrier in uh west virginia and this is this is important for folks that don't know that's
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:42.160]  this that's a cog base they say it's no longer one but it really is one absolutely is a project
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:47.520]  uh project greek island the underground bunker heavily guarded as we speak by the by the u.s
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:52.320]  marine corps um we're in full war footing and it's happening right now but that's right trough trough's
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:56.400]  literally gone to the bunker for what's about to happen he understands we're in full warmug
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:02.960]  the most sophisticated fallout shelter with complete capability connection hard tether to dc in the
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:08.240]  pentagon um i mean greenbrier that's that's not my coincidence it's the it's the former alternate
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:14.160]  government for people that don't know 100 so the train the train attack was blatant and obvious that
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:17.760]  was done that was done by remote done with drones they put a pad stand there but it was done with
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:23.280]  roads remote controlled the train was being followed by choppers choppers and drones they were
[02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:27.440]  were wary because the streets were supposed to be set that shut down there should have been nobody
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:32.720]  in the area they were alerted going to get done in time there were some you know some very interesting
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:38.320]  anomalies going on during the attack when they were in the uh when the garbage truck was hit
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:42.960]  luckily it was you know neutralized to a certain point it was only that truck being hit but it
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:47.280]  could have been much much more dangerous and i can't get any well i mean isn't that generally the
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:53.680]  message is is is we can get you that that was the final warning it was well they played their they
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:58.080]  played their jack of clubs with uh joe kennedy and the rebuttal they played you know they pulled
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:03.520]  the one to okie doke the audible getting crazy maxina they're putting joe kennedy and people
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:09.040]  laugh and they uh you know mock his uh his his rebuttal which it was cringe worthy but you have
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:13.040]  to understand what's being done there i mean if you have a pulse and a frontal cortex you have to
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:16.880]  understand what's going on there his family lineage that was a complete message to trump to
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:22.320]  say you know what happened to uh you know to jfk you know what happened and went on there so he
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:27.120]  he better he better had looked uncomfortable because he was sold out and um that's a message
[02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:31.840]  to trump in the g.o.p and obviously you see the false flags that followed afterwards um you know
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:37.440]  he's nothing he he wasn't the you know the last golden child that was a jack of clubs move that
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:41.840]  was a message to trump or you're gonna do this we're coming for you and joe kennedy is you know
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:46.160]  he knows what he's involved in stanford harvard he's into it i can't believe he got up there and
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:50.320]  said what he said and did what he did but who knows that's right let's come back then and get into

[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:33.840]  show they uh have dispatched their operatives to go on television and say if you release the memo
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:39.440]  there'll be a giant massacre and they've also said that because trump's criticized isis that he's
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.800]  going to cause big attacks in america and then clearly that whole thing in vegas has now come out
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:50.800]  just as zack and other sources said was a false flag carried out during the saudi arabian military
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:55.680]  visit uh and then a few weeks later trump went in and they arrested all those people and saudi
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:00.000]  arabia joined the coalition and zack talked about all that before it happened while it happened
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:07.120]  and after it happened so that's why zack is known to me not some anonymous q anon on h an
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:11.440]  who zack says is a group of good people and that we should all look at it that it's credible
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:17.520]  this is zack that's his real name i know his last name and again i've matched his voice up
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:20.560]  everything to when he's been on national television and interviews and you name it
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:26.800]  as a decorated soldier for many years uh at high levels of uh intelligence he's right there
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:32.560]  obviously uh in tampa right now so i want him to get right to it because i could just look at
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:37.440]  their playbook they're behind they're burning their shadow government's falling apart their deep
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:42.720]  state infiltration is falling apart everything they've touched is is is turning to dust uh they
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:47.200]  tried to overthrow the president that was a bunch of crimes it's blowing up in their face now they're
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:51.040]  desperate saying don't release the memo they've gone from saying oh it's no big deal to being so
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:58.720]  scared what's the false flag intel you've got can it be stopped uh and then how does it tie in to
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:05.920]  the next shoot a drop uh and what you're expecting them uh to try next and what is in the memo
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:13.520]  okay so uh there's a couple false flags that occurred um in the weeks prior and that's we
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:17.200]  haven't slowed down they've all been foiled i mean if you want to go to hawai if you want to go to
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:20.720]  a couple other things that we can get into after we get into this but the super bowl false flag
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:24.640]  what i need your guys to do they're your crew and all the you know info worries at home is
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:28.800]  just get on the fbi twitter right now look at what they posted today look what they posted
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:34.400]  yesterday these creepy videos about how big their security is going to be they're running drills
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:39.440]  exercises this is all their public push um and look into the typography on the videos that they
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:43.200]  have posted on our twitter you could pick it up right now i have my own intel that we're going to
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:47.840]  get into but just publicly what they're doing um obviously there's a war between the white house
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:53.760]  and the fbi that's no big secret but um when you start looking at very unconventional postings about
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:58.560]  the fbi bloating and kind of floating about exercises in this amount of power they have over
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:02.480]  the super bowl this weekend on their club on their public forum which they've never done maybe trump
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:08.720]  has sort of changed that guys but um yeah just look at their things and you look the chatter is
[02:50:08.720 --> 02:50:13.280]  out there i can't get into certain um speculations but the word on the street is this and this is
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:16.480]  credible and everyone who knows what they're looking at is looking at this and this is on
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:21.440]  blotters intelligence communities are looking at this um there's an attack plant this weekend at
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:25.920]  the super bowl during the state of the union you have trump first of all throughout the entire
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:29.680]  year trump's been at war with the nfl and the neil link he brings them up obviously all the stuff
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:35.120]  with the nf all the stuff with the fbi and the nfl as of late there's a credible threat this weekend
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:42.240]  and for the on the world stage the biggest stage in minneapolis um you know in minneapolis minnesota
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:48.960]  little mogadishu the biggest tamale community outside of tamalia so it's credible it's real
[02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:53.200]  they always have exercises and these sort of things going on while these are going on to have one of
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:58.960]  their windup cutouts do something right underneath their nose for the world to see and they are in
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:04.080]  a desperate measure here they've continued to do false flags for many months that trump has neutralized
[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:09.680]  and sort of you know played this sort of five d's in chess with them um but they need to know
[02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:13.680]  that they're desperate and doesn't mean that you know something you know that they won't
[02:51:13.680 --> 02:51:19.200]  that they could pull something off here because there are credible threats this weekend um they're
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:27.520]  trying to pull off something big it could have a it could have a dirty bomb effect for the world to
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:32.080]  see they would love nothing more to embarrass the american people hurt the american people and hurt
[02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:38.960]  trump um the city is set in setting perfect for this sort of thing and this is not just a stretch
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:44.480]  by my part um that's why nobody's kind of been talking about it but the threats are out there
[02:51:44.480 --> 02:51:50.720]  there's chatter out there we're we're tracking it but oh the fbi but be honest we can't trust them
[02:51:50.720 --> 02:51:57.440]  so we're going to need to sort of be very very vigilant and try to stop this right here um this
[02:51:57.440 --> 02:52:01.440]  is very serious this is very credible hasn't been in the news but make no mistake a lot of people
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:08.480]  know about this and it's obvious jack let me raise this clearly they've set trump up against the
[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:13.360]  nfl he stood up against it and said why are you being anti-american they would love to make themselves
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:19.360]  the victims they have said that uh if you keep criticizing is you're going to cause a massacre
[02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:25.120]  that's that's been the warning from the globalist deep state to trump by their by their capos publicly
[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:30.240]  on television so would they have a somali do it as the backup and then blame a patriot to say oh look
[02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:35.440]  a trump supporter truck bomb the super bowl oh my god it's trumps fault it's trumps fault or
[02:52:35.440 --> 02:52:40.960]  but they just have a somali do it and say oh because you've criticized uh you know islam you
[02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:46.320]  caused this to happen and then and and then try that as a distraction from the whole fiza memo
[02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:51.600]  and everything they've been up to yeah absolutely well first of all it's going to be many somalis
[02:52:51.600 --> 02:52:56.720]  unfortunately it's going to be many um somali individuals we've heard the chatter we know what's
[02:52:56.720 --> 02:53:02.320]  going on um it's conversations like this that hopefully you know you know blow their spot up but
[02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:06.720]  and we're showing and we're showing video of them all of america right now i'm sorry go ahead yeah
[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:12.560]  yeah i mean yeah it's it's a group of somali individuals there's obviously isis will take
[02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:18.400]  credit in conjunction with these individuals but um obviously the deep state has its hooks and when
[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:22.800]  it comes to these groups and they are deep state ran this is al cia da they are they're going for
[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:27.520]  their their last grasp but what you have what we have to understand is this um we hear everything
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:31.680]  they're doing we see everything they're doing so these individuals are desperate and they've picked
[02:53:31.680 --> 02:53:35.280]  their sides i'm hoping that they have a change of heart and we have to understand that the state of
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:41.760]  the union really publicly changed the momentum of a lot of things and the people on the left
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:46.240]  that are not going along with this i just don't get it i picked up that it broke the back of
[02:53:46.240 --> 02:53:51.280]  some of the stay behind networks and it also the poll show reached through to people who were in
[02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:56.800]  their haze 75 was the average poll point and that it was a mate i felt spiritually the enemy's back
[02:53:56.800 --> 02:54:02.880]  was broken uh is that what you're saying 100 percent and but again you know a lot of these
[02:54:02.880 --> 02:54:07.120]  individuals they're afraid if they don't go go you know go go on with the mission if they don't
[02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:11.120]  carry it out that they will be murdered themselves but they need to come out as little blurs they
[02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:15.760]  need to stop this activity exactly well what we've heard that fbi just and others have been whistle
[02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:20.800]  blowing uh to the intelligence committees and to trump and others at trumps all about not letting
[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:26.720]  secret info out but i think it needs to just start playing the cards now yeah i mean we they were
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:31.520]  playing as a sort of uh a game of chicken there with the uh memo the member's going to come out
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:36.160]  later today i expect later today maybe into the morning but it'll be you know it'll be within
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:40.960]  24 hours that's for sure um but they did you know sort of play this game and get the postponement of
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:45.520]  flint um you know sentencing there so they know what they're doing but you know let me just let
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:48.880]  everybody know in case they're not privy which is they're not they're out of their mind mccabe
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:54.400]  sung like a bird he was compromised i will lead okay i will lead as a free man now make no mistake
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:59.120]  he's sung like a bird okay i will lead told everything so if you know you're you know you're
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:03.120]  you're a funder from overseas this this this printout will lead who's walking the streets now
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:06.640]  just know that you're being surveilled just know that we hear everything and let's be clear for those
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:11.360]  that don't know he was the ringleader of the saudi breakaway grip funding much of the deep state
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:17.360]  trump showed up on his first official visit anywhere to a foreign country to riyadh to the
[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:22.320]  house of thought waived the sword and obviously we saw the change there will lead the free man
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:25.840]  will lead has no loyalty to the united states his pockets are derived they're gonna let him hold on
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:29.120]  to his i noticed the king of saudi raby i've seen a lot of video him doesn't normally look really
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:34.560]  freaked out he looks super freaked out with trump it's it's over it's changing in the state of the
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:38.000]  union was the most incredible thing i've ever seen the lunar activity it was going on we're not going
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:42.320]  to go down that road but it did you know this this timing is anointed this is the divine intervention
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:46.560]  this is something special this is something i believed in and we opened the call at the ms 13
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:50.960]  the the gun running this is what opened my eyes while i was in the military and you know being
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:55.120]  you know being prepared and being groomed to be something that was ridiculous and i think a lot of
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:59.440]  individuals whether you're a legislator whether you're a soldier whether you're an intelligence
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:04.560]  analyst or operator you could fall to you could you could fall into this and we need to open our
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:11.520]  eyes and have faith and realize this is real life be loyal don't do this okay don't do this these
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:15.120]  false flags don't end well and the people who are funding this do the elites on the left and then
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:20.960]  and then deep state actors even deeper entrenched how do you think this ends it's over the writing's on
[02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:24.960]  the wall they're like well i told mike adams all fair and everybody else the studio i said i've never
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:31.520]  felt this much energy this much uh spidey sense as they say six cents that something huge is about
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:36.400]  to happen and i feel good rising and evil rising and you see it as well but uh that's why trump
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:40.640]  said oh i'll talk to the FBI director maybe in two or three weeks that was signaling your whole
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:45.920]  thing's going to be exposed within you won't even want the interview miller they were going to pull
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:51.840]  off several attacks all at once around the stadium um i shouldn't say they were you know it's still
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:55.920]  going on but hopefully we could stop it here several attacks to cause panic hurt individuals
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:01.680]  into a certain location and detonated dirty bomb for the world to see on the world stage to embarrass
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:06.160]  trump to embarrass the economy and little more the issue and this ties everything and it would
[02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:11.440]  act as a distraction in an absolute well that's right cuz trump didn't back down with vegas which
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:16.720]  goes right after his pocketbook hotels and things exactly well and you would notice he trump really
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:21.520]  didn't even speak about the quote on quote failed hawaiian missile test that test wasn't failed those
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:26.800]  systems don't work like that that that was a neutralized threat they tried to lure him into
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:32.800]  a pearl harbor um type strike on north korea we heard them we saw them yeah just like bay of pigs

[03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:35.440]  the clash of civilization the globalist planned on destabilizing the middle east and islamic
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:41.040]  countries putting radicals in charge then imploding western borders using the radical islamic threat
[03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:45.040]  to take liberties here and then playing us off against each other to then bring in a world
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:50.080]  super state that bans religion except for the one world religion in answer to the mega war
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:57.760]  but the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray and the pentagon and all the military
[03:00:57.760 --> 03:01:02.320]  people I know and the people I talk to who've been at the highest levels and aren't the highest
[03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:08.240]  levels of all this everybody gets the picture now it's very clear they know the stakes and they know
[03:01:08.240 --> 03:01:14.160]  it's bad for everybody except the sicko globalist that want total control and so Zach is always
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:17.760]  amazing hope we'll come back on tomorrow and maybe sunday so i'll be live on air during the
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:22.400]  super bowl covering this obviously a prime target they already hit vegas we know that was some of
[03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:27.920]  the same stay behind network you say you've got the intel you only prove inaccurate which makes
[03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:33.120]  this horrifying but it sounds like you're saying hopefully it's getting rolled up we'll we'll see
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:36.960]  what happens here but you were getting into the missile test i've talked to folks that we've worked
[03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:41.840]  in that they say there's five fail safes before that happens uh and that there's really no way
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:46.560]  that that could even go on obviously someone fell on their sword got reassigned what's the intel
[03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:52.080]  you've got zach yeah you know when i was coming i was kind of confusing for people it's sort of
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:56.560]  you know bizarre the sort of explanations that you hear and things like this it's just not a
[03:01:56.560 --> 03:02:01.360]  reality that there could just be operator error was not operator error that was a neutralized
[03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:07.680]  world situation and desperate in a desperation operation to trigger trump into an attack on
[03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:13.840]  north korea um you know via pro harbour any of these other um golf of talk and sort of incidents
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:19.760]  this is nothing new in our in our unfortunately in our deep state country's history so it's it's
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:23.760]  it's very dangerous and it's kind of obviously classified what really went on but all you need
[03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:28.000]  to do is look at the reaction of the actual white house um trump made it very clear in the state of
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:33.120]  the union that we are not going to televised and we're not going to put out what our tactics are
[03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:37.680]  and what our plans are against enemy combatants and terrorists and threats around the world so
[03:02:38.960 --> 03:02:43.760]  you know they could go along this is just operator error this was a deep state desperation operation
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:48.640]  to trigger war and to distract from everything that's unfolding now unfortunately we we of course
[03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:52.800]  were days ahead of them even weeks ahead of them this wasn't something new we heard all the chatter
[03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:57.040]  we heard everything and it was actually neutralized there was an actual threat if you look at the
[03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:02.960]  time span between the the alert going out and it actually the next alert coming in to say hey sorry
[03:03:02.960 --> 03:03:10.560]  just a mistake no big deal um you know this is probably i don't know 20 to 30 minutes longer
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:14.240]  than what it would actually take for the missile to actually come here if there wasn't sure of course
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:19.360]  well i've traveled to collide to that main missile defensive missile base there further uh
[03:03:19.360 --> 03:03:25.520]  your most westly part of the united states and uh i mean again north korea has been firing missiles
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:30.080]  from your information was it north korea did somebody else uh fire a missile to try to confuse
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:34.880]  things to trick trump into giving the order to print we attack north korea then they'd say sir
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:39.280]  that never really happened and then remove him because i saw them beta test and sell that idea
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:45.600]  yeah this was so the official information and it'll come out but you know this was supposedly shot
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:52.480]  underwater this was from a submarine this was this was a real threat um they are you saying it was okay
[03:03:52.480 --> 03:03:59.040]  so it was a Polaris style missile yes and it was credible but it was neutralized so you know
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:05.200]  individuals in the systems did you know sort of freak out and there was some there was some um you
[03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:09.200]  know operator error at a certain level but not to the capacity that nothing happened there was a
[03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:14.400]  credible threat in underwater that was gonna you know breach and obviously hit the hit the islands
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:20.400]  there that was neutralized almost immediately after it took off um look and you're saying it wasn't
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:25.120]  with north korea some rogue group trying to false flag us into confrontation with north korea
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:30.800]  100% and off of north green off of north green waters wasn't even close to here but it was off
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:35.200]  north green waters and uh that's gonna come out and everybody knows it but again i respect trump
[03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:38.240]  i see what he's doing he doesn't want to put everything out there well is that why we've seen
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:42.800]  all these missile trails and huge explosions in the northern pacific and other areas i mean because
[03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:45.840]  it looks like a bunch of craziness is going on they're shooting all sorts of stuff down
[03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:50.640]  no he's not giving them the glory and not giving them the credit that there's credible threats
[03:04:50.640 --> 03:04:55.440]  he's neutralizing them and not giving hold on we got to finish up and anthony koumi has taken over
[03:04:55.440 --> 03:05:01.920]  i'm so excited the new product at info warslife.com in a glass bottle two months servings filled to
[03:05:01.920 --> 03:05:09.520]  the brim filled with the absolute top the real red pill this is a heart and brain pill a new
[03:05:09.520 --> 03:05:14.800]  tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that
[03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:21.040]  quite frankly uh i just went off what i saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients
[03:05:21.040 --> 03:05:24.800]  but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two hundred dollars
[03:05:25.680 --> 03:05:30.000]  for the formulae and i came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:37.600]  developers non-gmo made right here in america 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen you add the

[03:06:21.280 --> 03:06:26.080]  anthony cumia of the amazing compound media is coming up just like seven eight minutes from now
[03:06:26.880 --> 03:06:31.280]  it will be talking to him always enjoy after i get off here eating my lunch when he has so i can
[03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:36.000]  listen to all the great points he makes a farmly top show an xm former top syndication around the
[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:41.600]  country but he's a libertarian and so they they kicked him off both and left the liberals
[03:06:41.600 --> 03:06:46.080]  still on air but now he's got his own great syndicated system at compoundmedia.com we're
[03:06:46.080 --> 03:06:53.840]  going to him in a moment jack i've studied the missile base i know that they even caught leftist
[03:06:53.840 --> 03:06:59.440]  in al-qaeda and isis operatives in it that's why i actually went to hawaii doubled as a kind of
[03:06:59.440 --> 03:07:05.040]  a rescation but i did talk to some folks there obviously people notice week i was there they
[03:07:05.040 --> 03:07:09.440]  arrested somebody at the base uh and i went out and shot some video and talked about how critical
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:14.560]  it was i knew coming up with north korea deep staters people would be targeting uh that base
[03:07:14.560 --> 03:07:20.960]  uh spies who transferred new north korea discovered uh there is the video uh one of the videos that i
[03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:28.640]  break down from from hawaii and from the missile base uh but absolutely there's no way except the
[03:07:28.640 --> 03:07:33.200]  telemetry it's then checked by humans they didn't go through the switching process and that alert
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:37.760]  wouldn't go out as you said oh it was a false alert for 38 minutes it only takes about from that
[03:07:37.760 --> 03:07:41.840]  area the pacific what 14 minutes with the average booster with those russian boosters they've got
[03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:47.200]  from ukraine uh you know to get up in the atmosphere then come back in uh so clearly something went on
[03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:52.400]  clearly something got shot down now you've got huge missiles getting shot down over russia uh you've
[03:07:52.400 --> 03:07:57.040]  got it looks like a nuke probably went off a few weeks ago and that got shut down just incredible
[03:07:57.040 --> 03:08:01.440]  shaking the ground you've got other missiles getting shot down uh you've had the famous chinese
[03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:06.080]  launch you know years ago off the pacific the threat and everybody with a polaris style
[03:08:06.080 --> 03:08:10.880]  sea launch missile uh so all your intel adds into that you're saying that's what you got from sources
[03:08:10.880 --> 03:08:18.640]  that is just beyond sensational that's horrifying but that fits that a a a a false alarm like that's
[03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:24.000]  basically impossible the story we heard somebody hit a wrong button we know is impossible you're
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:28.800]  saying what really happened is trump has been shooting down missiles but then figuring out it
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:35.120]  wasn't north korea and standing down foiling their plan yeah absolutely understand that these are you
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:40.800]  know that it's a deep state operation operation and sort of communists ran um which is also part
[03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:45.920]  of the deep state operation our china sort of um i don't know our communication our relationship and
[03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:50.000]  same thing with this train attract this train attack that occurred um you notice he in the
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:54.320]  species just gave there at greenbrier oh you know he just he cut he sort of eludes to it as oh you
[03:08:54.320 --> 03:08:57.680]  know hope everybody's okay in the train attack he doesn't come out and say what we already know
[03:08:57.680 --> 03:09:01.920]  that's i mean that that train was you know being followed by chopper's drones there should have
[03:09:01.920 --> 03:09:05.680]  been nobody around they know exactly what's going on they have video footage but he's not going to
[03:09:05.680 --> 03:09:09.920]  come out and say he's not even giving them the floor he's just neutralizing them they're going
[03:09:09.920 --> 03:09:13.200]  through all and by the way here here's how we know all this i'm gonna go back to you sack
[03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:17.760]  they pre-program anything they do so i remember the last couple months if he orders the illegal
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:22.480]  strike we'll take him out if he does this and that we'll take him out we'll remove him we're ready
[03:09:22.480 --> 03:09:28.400]  and all these clinton holdovers saying this out of the blue and saying oh there's racism at the
[03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:33.840]  air force academy and that's a false flag and it's all trumps fault you could see them beta testing
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:39.840]  and pre-planning this so they could do it this is amazing keep going yes and uh they you know
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:43.280]  they underestimated obviously the election and those numbers were even wrong they say he was
[03:09:43.280 --> 03:09:48.000]  elected not by the popular vote but you know through the electoral college yeah that's correct
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:53.040]  he was um you know elected to the electoral college but those numbers are way wrong and
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:56.480]  trump alluded to it in the very first word in his speech they're saying now we know as a couple
[03:09:56.480 --> 03:10:00.800]  minutes ago what the real numbers were it's all coming out dhs ran a major operations during the
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:05.280]  election they're uncovering it all and i just got to say this and that's important because
[03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:09.600]  trump has the has the pulse and he has the backing of patriots in our government so
[03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:14.720]  when it comes to this q q and on phenomenon i just need to be very clear i am not q and on you know
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:20.800]  i'm not typing on chan boards um make no mistake i'm chiming in in board rooms but i'm not q and
[03:10:20.800 --> 03:10:25.680]  on i respect what they're doing i know they're doing great work um i'm just you know there's people
[03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:30.720]  who are patriots in this country and we don't need to pick sides or you know um you know root for one
[03:10:30.720 --> 03:10:35.440]  over the other as gospel we need to come no no i totally agree i was just simply saying people
[03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:39.760]  can speculate all day about q and on i i know who you are you've given us great info and the fruit
[03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:43.680]  of the tree is you know really really what proves things just want to stop yeah i just want us to
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:47.280]  all come together i feel i think we'd be more effective if you came together and you've been
[03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:52.880]  great but just yeah as as a as a listening base as as a as a country like look they're doing great
[03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:56.560]  things i'm doing great things hundreds of us are doing great things thousands of us are doing
[03:10:56.560 --> 03:11:00.320]  great things but it's all you know i'm together and work you know they're doing great work and
[03:11:00.320 --> 03:11:04.080]  i'm doing what i'm doing and uh i acknowledge and tip i had to them not involved with it but
[03:11:04.080 --> 03:11:08.240]  i acknowledge them and i see them so they're doing great work and i appreciate it but um but
[03:11:08.240 --> 03:11:12.320]  that being said look um there's also other individuals that are going to be coming into
[03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:17.120]  this like us and this month um the first day of black history month what a way to kick off black
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:22.080]  history month lowest black unemployment um you know that's that's a side issue we could go in there
[03:11:22.080 --> 03:11:27.200]  but i know your time's limited um julia saunch is very active right now in ways that i can't quite
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:32.000]  get into but make a mistake he is a patriot and the communication at the highest levels of our
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:38.640]  government is pretty transparent so um you know they they they just got to get ready for the next
[03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:42.480]  couple months here what's going to come out in the next couple months is pretty important actually
[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:45.760]  in the next week with this memo being released is very important but we can't lose sight of
[03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:50.880]  certain threats with you know right in front of us that's my next issue i was told hey this memo
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:55.680]  that's been declassified the blacked out areas are who ordered it proving perjury the media
[03:11:55.680 --> 03:12:01.600]  spotted that i was saying it was the whole memo i was saying it's a blueprint with this memo of all
[03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:07.040]  their perjury of the nest of the orders of of plans for violence against the president and now
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:11.680]  the fbi leadership is still flipping out saying don't release it what is your info
[03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:18.000]  on what is in the memo well first of all it's a memo okay the it's going to be pretty damning
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:22.400]  because what it's going to release is sort of it's going to break through this sort of brick wall
[03:12:22.400 --> 03:12:25.680]  of of course the government would never do this of course this couldn't occur of course certain
[03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:30.080]  individuals want to be involved in this sort of thing well actually yes they are but in my opinion
[03:12:30.080 --> 03:12:35.120]  it's fairly mild it's important for what it sort of alludes to and it's important for you know
[03:12:35.120 --> 03:12:39.520]  obviously sure they're just getting us ready for all of it to come out as if these groups don't
[03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:47.360]  capitulate uh it it's the blueprint of the clinton insiders this is just the beginning this is just
[03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:51.840]  the beginning the memo is important i mean put it that way it's important just to kind of say hey
[03:12:51.840 --> 03:12:55.360]  look this is what we're dealing with you thought you were dealing with something that was infallible
[03:12:55.360 --> 03:12:59.040]  you're wrong this is what's really going on let's get off the russian collusion let's get off all
[03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:03.840]  this let's actually see what the doj is doing and we open the call talking about operation castaway
[03:13:03.840 --> 03:13:08.560]  you think the doj and the fbi is infallible we're you know we're arming our enemies we're
[03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:12.800]  we're laundering money for drugs and notice how it did come out that obama killed investigations
[03:13:12.800 --> 03:13:17.600]  into hezbollah running guns and drugs in the u.s to find operations in the middle east
[03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:24.240]  operation castaway is obama and holder solely so this falls out kind of outside of fast and
[03:13:24.240 --> 03:13:29.920]  furious and this is incredible this is unbelievable info and nothing has happened so we're seeing
[03:13:29.920 --> 03:13:33.120]  sessions sort of he knows this information he understands what's going on with him a little
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:37.040]  bit more time but it's no coincidence well the biggest thing you're doing is raise the alarm
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:41.520]  that you've got the intel in the chatter you're saying directly that that they're picking up the
[03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:48.480]  fact that a large group of similes is planning multiple attacks uh on the super bowl multiple
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:53.040]  attacks that will eventually lead to a fairly big event that we're hoping to neutralize obviously
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:57.520]  with this sort of information and and like the missile test like like the train attack like
[03:13:57.520 --> 03:14:04.720]  other things that were either stopped completely or you know um right when they began yeah absolutely
[03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:08.480]  so i have faith in what's going on i have faith in individuals being able to stop it but this
[03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:13.200]  information was critical and of course you'll start to see stuff break about this but fbi fbi
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:18.640]  by their own admission is this textbook false flag running operations v9 11 same time same place
[03:14:18.640 --> 03:14:23.520]  and they got their cutouts and individuals who are brainwashed in a trance and they are literally
[03:14:23.520 --> 03:14:27.200]  running for their lives the fbi that's the problem we've never had a precedent in this country like
[03:14:27.200 --> 03:14:32.480]  we do now with the white house physically fighting the fbi and the sort of zen don't bring it up
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:36.640]  we're bigger than that uh message coming out the white house is incredible because the stuff
[03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:41.200]  that's going on behind the scenes that the people truly know it would be i mean would just be
[03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:46.160]  unbelievable there's a civil war going on and i wouldn't say the whole fbi i don't just do that to
[03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:50.880]  grovel most fbi agents are low-level doing stuff but i mean i mean what would you say like the top
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:56.800]  10 of the fbi is a bunch of clinton operatives uh probably five percent five percent of the real
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:15:00.560]  power brokers everyday field agents are pretty good guys of course sure so i'm saying it's the
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:05.840]  top it's the top i mean it yeah all right well listen uh please come back onto mara and come on

[03:20:37.840 --> 03:20:45.440]  wars dot com wow i gotta tell you something i get the opportunity to sit here before i come on
[03:20:45.440 --> 03:20:57.040]  on and watch and listen to alex um do uh his last couple of breaks uh of his show and i realize i am
[03:20:57.040 --> 03:21:07.520]  guilty of what a majority of of the country is guilty of uh and i i shouldn't be because i i do
[03:21:07.520 --> 03:21:14.560]  have my eyes open and i listen to people like like alex jones and that amazing uh informancy just
[03:21:14.560 --> 03:21:21.920]  had on was his name zack i think uh anonymous informant but but i'm i'm listening to this
[03:21:22.800 --> 03:21:31.200]  and i am guilty of complacency of watching what mainstream media puts out there and i know it's
[03:21:31.200 --> 03:21:38.880]  it's bull i know it's crap but i still listen and think well this is what happened this is
[03:21:38.880 --> 03:21:48.240]  being presented to me uh by by what we traditionally called the news and uh well that must be what
[03:21:48.240 --> 03:21:54.160]  happens and then i lower my head down to the grass and i start grazing again like the sheep
[03:21:54.880 --> 03:22:03.680]  that i am uh and then i sit here and i watch alex talking to his his guests and it spins my head
[03:22:03.680 --> 03:22:10.160]  around it just spins my head around and after everything we've seen in the past couple of years
[03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:18.560]  since the uh we've been introduced to president donald trump uh you realize you cannot take anything
[03:22:18.560 --> 03:22:25.920]  for granted you can't watch the news and and think that whatever they're presenting to you
[03:22:25.920 --> 03:22:34.320]  is the fact of the matter and and that's the way it happened you just can't do it and and the proof
[03:22:34.320 --> 03:22:43.840]  is in the fact that as that onion gets peeled apart on a daily basis and we start seeing
[03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:51.280]  what these people are doing to this country the machinery behind the scenes that we never got a
[03:22:51.280 --> 03:23:00.960]  glimpse at that is now being exposed you start realizing that things aren't as they seem and
[03:23:00.960 --> 03:23:07.360]  when i was just watching alex before uh just a few minutes ago and uh him and his guests were talking
[03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:20.560]  about uh the the train the g.o.p. train full of of uh uh the the entire g.o.p. is on that train
[03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:30.800]  they're they're going to retreat uh and they hit a garbage truck at a crossing
[03:23:30.800 --> 03:23:37.280]  and then you start thinking because i i'm listening and going yeah the security
[03:23:38.080 --> 03:23:48.240]  is astounding for these people the train by the way can't turn the train can't get lost
[03:23:48.800 --> 03:23:56.320]  the train can't go anywhere it it it it it's on a track that's what makes it a train
[03:23:56.320 --> 03:24:04.400]  so they can absolutely keep that secure the entire length of the trip it was a chartered
[03:24:04.400 --> 03:24:14.480]  train specifically for the g.o.p. to attend a retreat you can't keep a four foot four and a
[03:24:14.480 --> 03:24:23.120]  half foot swath of track clear from point a to point b that that needs to be secure because
[03:24:23.120 --> 03:24:31.440]  half your government is in it it just doesn't figure i now i don't know what the ulterior
[03:24:31.440 --> 03:24:38.080]  motive would be here i don't know what the the game plan or the end game to actually
[03:24:38.080 --> 03:24:47.280]  having the train hit a garbage truck at a crossing would be i don't know but i'm very skeptical
[03:24:47.280 --> 03:24:56.880]  that a a truck wandered on to a track that they know is going to be occupied momentarily by a
[03:24:56.880 --> 03:25:06.000]  train carrying half the government and how in the hell does that happen like they said drones
[03:25:06.640 --> 03:25:15.760]  helicopters ground security all of them are are deployed to protect this train yet they miss
[03:25:15.760 --> 03:25:22.960]  a garbage truck on the tracks i don't know again when i heard the story i'm like oh look at that
[03:25:22.960 --> 03:25:30.480]  garbage truck on the tracks oh no one's really well the driver's dead but i'm like oh that's
[03:25:30.480 --> 03:25:38.320]  that's kind of odd i believed it i believed it i do an info wars show every other thursday
[03:25:38.320 --> 03:25:47.440]  and i believed it what hope is there for the rest of the world we can't just take this stuff at
[03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:57.360]  face value anymore can't do it cannot do it the the the the false alarm for the missile alert uh
[03:25:57.360 --> 03:26:06.160]  on hawaii again i went ah look at that dummy some dummy hit the button and then i'm listening and
[03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:12.320]  and you realize 30 minutes or 30 some odd minutes over 30 minutes this went on
[03:26:13.120 --> 03:26:18.640]  where people absolutely thought there was a missile attack yet it was uh some dummy that
[03:26:18.640 --> 03:26:26.080]  hit a button and and it lasted longer than it would have taken a missile to actually hit hawaii
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:33.680]  at that distance why and then you start listening to alex and and some of his guests and and you're
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:45.200]  like wow that it doesn't figure it makes no sense the story that's put out troubled worker a troubled
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:54.160]  worker it's always something and and when i watch alex uh on info wars you start realizing wow
[03:26:55.120 --> 03:27:02.880]  you think your eyes are open i mean i i honestly think i am awoken i've been awoken
[03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:09.440]  to a lot of the the garbage that's being pumped out as information to the general public uh
[03:27:09.440 --> 03:27:19.680]  here in the united states uh no i am not awake yet my eyes are still i'm groggy i was awake
[03:27:19.680 --> 03:27:28.400]  i hit the snooze alarm and uh we can't do that we cannot afford to do that we are seeing people in
[03:27:28.400 --> 03:27:39.360]  power uh in in in places of great power uh lying to us uh and and donald trump being elected president
[03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:46.320]  has started the process of peeling away the that protective shield that they have had around them
[03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:53.600]  for decades probably for the entire existence of the united states of america the the upper
[03:27:53.600 --> 03:28:00.800]  echelon of power uh in in this country has lied to the people for their own devices and again i'm
[03:28:00.800 --> 03:28:06.240]  not sure what that is yet i don't know i hear alex all the time and other people talk about
[03:28:06.240 --> 03:28:12.880]  globalists and globalism and uh these these power brokers and whatnot i don't know what the end game
[03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:21.520]  is i still have to uh do a little more uh research on that but whatever the end game might be uh
[03:28:21.520 --> 03:28:28.480]  truth be told we're not be being told the truth and uh it's it's blatantly obvious uh i think to
[03:28:28.480 --> 03:28:35.920]  anybody um that's been watching the news for the past year and a half two years since donald trump
[03:28:35.920 --> 03:28:40.880]  said he was running for president that that is slowly being peeled away we are opening our eyes
[03:28:40.880 --> 03:28:47.840]  but like i said even myself i still get fooled and we just can't afford to uh do that oh i like
[03:28:47.840 --> 03:28:53.600]  that music it's wonderful uh we'll be right back don't go anywhere anthony comey in at inforce.com

[03:35:40.080 --> 03:35:46.880]  man i gotta tell you that state of the union speech uh that trump gave was amazing it was
[03:35:46.880 --> 03:35:52.880]  amazing uh and you might think like well what was amazing about it a lot of presidents give
[03:35:52.880 --> 03:35:57.360]  those state of the union addresses and they pretty much lay out what they've done and
[03:35:57.360 --> 03:36:04.000]  what the uh future may hold for the country uh what's amazing about it anthony it's amazing
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:12.720]  because it shut down the democrats it shut down the liberal media they didn't know what to do
[03:36:12.720 --> 03:36:21.040]  do they are panicked there was nothing in there that they could uh place sound bites of
[03:36:21.760 --> 03:36:30.640]  and and profess uh racism and sexism and homophobia and transphobia islamophobia
[03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:38.640]  all the phobias and isms that they love uh labeling people they just couldn't do it
[03:36:38.640 --> 03:36:49.520]  it was such an optimistic view of uh america when when uh trump when he was running for
[03:36:49.520 --> 03:36:56.160]  president he would say things like make america great again and and oh would they laugh at that
[03:36:56.720 --> 03:37:00.720]  they laugh at it and then they cried about it and they call it
[03:37:00.720 --> 03:37:10.800]  harkening back to a a day of of racism in this country and uh horrid women women's uh suffrage
[03:37:11.680 --> 03:37:18.080]  like the old days of women having no rights and and absolutely it absolutely isn't that
[03:37:18.640 --> 03:37:26.400]  he spelt it out he he stood there and talked about a an amazing country the strides we we've
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:35.680]  made in the past year have been astounding the economy is booming unemployment is uh uh plummeting
[03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:46.320]  especially in minority communities uh yet the democrats wouldn't even stand and applaud
[03:37:46.320 --> 03:37:55.120]  when when we watched trump say that uh black unemployment in the united states uh is at an
[03:37:55.120 --> 03:38:06.320]  all-time low that is historic that is an amazing accomplishment in a year and if you recall again
[03:38:06.320 --> 03:38:12.640]  another thing everyone laughed at my god did trump get laughed at a lot he said to the black
[03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:21.600]  community during his campaign hey look at what the democrats and decades of of their rule over

[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:32.320]  their faces why because what trump just announced was hey there goes your power over these people
[03:39:33.040 --> 03:39:40.160]  when trump said what have you got to lose he was talking about those people that didn't do
[03:39:40.160 --> 03:39:46.560]  anything for you they kept you in poverty they kept your neighborhoods broken down they kept you
[03:39:46.560 --> 03:39:53.440]  in crime and they gave you no hope the democrats love talking about hope oh my god every every

[03:40:33.440 --> 03:40:41.200]  that all the congressional black caucus and a lot of democrats heard was your power is gone
[03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:48.960]  over uh your constituents that you have been bamboozling for decades they looked on and said
[03:40:48.960 --> 03:40:56.720]  what the hell are we going to do if everybody that we had had been doling out dollars to
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:41:02.080]  and telling them that there there's nothing they could do about it see a light at the end of the
[03:41:02.080 --> 03:41:07.280]  tunnel what are we going to do how are we going to keep them in our pocket how are we going to
[03:41:07.280 --> 03:41:14.960]  keep them voting for us if they see somebody that actually gave them a job gave them dignity the

[03:41:46.160 --> 03:41:54.080]  mad too i'd be sitting there at miserable just like they were because they are not serving their
[03:41:54.080 --> 03:42:02.240]  constituents they're serving themselves staying in power and the way they did that was distracting
[03:42:02.240 --> 03:42:10.000]  their constituents from that light from that glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel don't
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:19.520]  look at that ego here you go look at the dollar don't look over there slide of hand and uh
[03:42:20.640 --> 03:42:26.640]  that continued throughout the entire state of the union address so many other occasions during
[03:42:26.640 --> 03:42:33.760]  that state of the union address where democrats were stone faced and genuinely angry from what
[03:42:33.760 --> 03:42:40.320]  trump was was saying because with everything he said it chipped away at another piece of their
[03:42:40.320 --> 03:42:45.920]  power base and their their hold over their constituents because all they see are voters
[03:42:46.560 --> 03:42:53.200]  and they need those voters to believe that they need them be right back anthony kumia in info wars

[03:47:26.160 --> 03:47:33.200]  boo boo boo welcome back anthony kumia info wars dot com uh talking about the state of the union
[03:47:33.200 --> 03:47:40.320]  address that was uh amazing um uh nothing is coincidental nothing is left to chance during
[03:47:40.320 --> 03:47:48.080]  these things uh everything is very well planned out uh that during the the speech uh even the
[03:47:48.080 --> 03:47:56.400]  ability to predict what the democrats are going to do and how to respond to it we saw a great example
[03:47:56.400 --> 03:48:03.600]  of this uh trump talking about his immigration his immigration plans uh which has just been
[03:48:03.600 --> 03:48:14.320]  uh such an important issue and uh people are very vocal about it uh they they have a vested
[03:48:14.320 --> 03:48:21.440]  interest both sides to uh the the left seems to want voters and uh the the right seems to want
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:28.240]  a secure nation with secure borders uh again the onion skin being peeled away we have seen
[03:48:28.240 --> 03:48:34.880]  the true intent of a lot of these um politicians so when trump is talking about eliminating
[03:48:35.840 --> 03:48:43.280]  chain migration and eliminating this lottery based system where um we we want a merit based
[03:48:43.280 --> 03:48:49.840]  system of of people that are going to come to this country and contribute uh not be burdensome
[03:48:49.840 --> 03:48:55.520]  to other people that are already here that's what we we heard from trump and the groans you heard
[03:48:55.520 --> 03:49:04.160]  heard literal groans from uh the democrats and at that moment when he said that and they groaned
[03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:14.480]  and he said i'd like to introduce you to two families who have lost children to ms-13 it was
[03:49:14.480 --> 03:49:28.320]  so perfectly done to show those groaning people uh in that that chamber that their system of immigration
[03:49:29.200 --> 03:49:36.080]  is a failure and it's not only costing us a lot of money it is literally costing people here their
[03:49:36.080 --> 03:49:47.520]  lives and there is no upside that can compensate for innocent people being murdered and then you
[03:49:47.520 --> 03:49:57.360]  you watch the usual suspects cnn msnbc uh any of the networks uh news uh and what you heard was
[03:49:57.360 --> 03:50:08.320]  was donald trump hates immigrants i have never seen the word illegal being eliminated from
[03:50:09.200 --> 03:50:15.840]  everything on network news when it comes to immigration oh he hates immigrants he doesn't
[03:50:15.840 --> 03:50:22.640]  want uh immigrants in this country neil degrasse tyson tweeted well let me uh i don't know uh
[03:50:22.640 --> 03:50:32.560]  if you know this but uh a third of all of the nobel prizes for science in the united states
[03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:39.280]  that that were won by americans a third of them were won by immigrants and i tweeted them back and
[03:50:39.280 --> 03:50:46.800]  i said uh does that you mean illegal immigrants because to say immigrants has nothing to do
[03:50:46.800 --> 03:50:53.920]  with this conversation why would you post something that has literally nothing to do with what anyone's
[03:50:53.920 --> 03:51:01.040]  talking about yes amazing immigrants that came to this country and and and worked their way through
[03:51:01.600 --> 03:51:07.440]  the system that is in place the laws that are in place to come here and become americans
[03:51:08.160 --> 03:51:15.280]  and contribute there is not a person on in this country a sane person in this country
[03:51:15.280 --> 03:51:22.000]  that is against that that is not the issue that is not what is being discussed so for him and so
[03:51:22.000 --> 03:51:29.600]  many other people of like-minded people to believe that you could post something and say look how
[03:51:29.600 --> 03:51:36.480]  great immigrants are and not include the word illegal in front of it it's dishonest you're
[03:51:36.480 --> 03:51:43.760]  trying to to use sleight of hand you're trying to make one thing another thing legal immigrants
[03:51:43.760 --> 03:51:51.360]  and illegal immigrants have nothing to do with each other but they are constantly trying to
[03:51:51.360 --> 03:52:00.880]  confuse us with that terminology they are trying to make out donald trump as a racist anybody who
[03:52:00.880 --> 03:52:09.360]  who is against illegal immigration anybody that is for a border wall and and more secure borders
[03:52:09.360 --> 03:52:16.800]  is a racist and doesn't appreciate immigrants that's what we hear so neil degrasse tyson's post
[03:52:16.800 --> 03:52:24.240]  meant nothing it was completely irrelevant congratulations to the nobel prize winners
[03:52:24.240 --> 03:52:29.520]  in science that were immigrants to this country uh is that what he wanted with that tweet because
[03:52:29.520 --> 03:52:37.600]  that's all he gets nothing else makes any sense it was uh there were moments like that during
[03:52:37.600 --> 03:52:44.000]  his state of the union um but the biggest thing i noticed was the optimism and not this phony
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:51.760]  optimism he spelled out what the past year has given us just amazing economy security jobs uh
[03:52:52.640 --> 03:53:01.440]  businesses bringing dollars back home repatriating money and jobs we heard of so many companies
[03:53:01.440 --> 03:53:08.480]  after the tax uh plan was signed that gave out bonuses to their their employees people already
[03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:14.640]  starting to notice the consumer confidence is back there was a general feeling that the country's
[03:53:14.640 --> 03:53:21.440]  getting better and that the average guy or woman out there can work make more money and keep it
[03:53:21.440 --> 03:53:26.800]  not turn it over to the government for some program that will never benefit uh you or the country
[03:53:26.800 --> 03:53:32.880]  so when you you heard donald trump give this state of the union it was optimistic but not
[03:53:32.880 --> 03:53:41.120]  that phony optimism uh he spelled out actual things that are helping this country and then
[03:53:41.120 --> 03:53:52.160]  we went to old drooling joe kennedy the democratic response to the state of the union was laughable
[03:53:52.160 --> 03:54:01.440]  there's old drooling joe with um i don't know what it was cut look what is he doing
[03:54:03.120 --> 03:54:07.200]  he put on chapstick with a plunger he just he put it on and then went
[03:54:09.200 --> 03:54:14.960]  and and that was it and you're on joe well let me tell you something
[03:54:14.960 --> 03:54:24.400]  but besides that horrific distract look what is it oh my god it's like my nana
[03:54:25.120 --> 03:54:36.480]  he's got my lips to dry where's my lip balm nana uh he gets up there and just spells out doom and
[03:54:36.480 --> 03:54:48.080]  gloom doom and gloom we just heard the president spell out and give you facts about how optimistic
[03:54:48.080 --> 03:54:57.920]  this country is now how the future looks bright for the regular worker in this country and then joe
[03:54:57.920 --> 03:55:03.200]  gets up there first of all he's in a garage uh somewhere making it look like he was just working
[03:55:03.200 --> 03:55:10.720]  on a car now the hood's up we're all working here let me get my shirt sleeves up and he just
[03:55:10.720 --> 03:55:17.600]  starts talking about how this isn't us this isn't our country what being prosperous
[03:55:19.920 --> 03:55:26.480]  actually actually being able to succeed by eliminating regulations allowing americans
[03:55:26.480 --> 03:55:33.680]  to keep their hard-earned money what isn't us respecting our flag and our military and our
[03:55:33.680 --> 03:55:42.000]  police and the laws well that is in america but old drool and joe was uh giving this speech and
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:51.920]  as i'm watching it i noticed what it looked like it looked old it looked worn out because it was
[03:55:51.920 --> 03:56:03.520]  exactly what we had been hearing for eight years under obama it it it was oddly nostalgic to hear
[03:56:03.520 --> 03:56:12.240]  this gloom because that is what the democrats need you to believe they never want you to think
[03:56:12.800 --> 03:56:18.720]  that this country is doing well they never want you to think that you you have the ability
[03:56:18.720 --> 03:56:28.640]  to make something of yourself and raise that's fantastic and raise your family without the
[03:56:28.640 --> 03:56:37.040]  help of them we will we need we will help you you know what get out of our way that's what
[03:56:37.040 --> 03:56:43.120]  donald trump was saying we'll get out of your way we're gonna set the table for you so that you
[03:56:43.120 --> 03:56:49.680]  can succeed in this country and then we're gonna get the hell out of your way and the democrats
[03:56:49.680 --> 03:56:56.960]  can't have that that's what all their power is based on them telling you you need us you need
[03:56:56.960 --> 03:57:05.200]  us and they keep you right at that level right before you you revolt they keep you down and
[03:57:05.200 --> 03:57:10.480]  you could tell because michelle obama uh is frightening america by saying all we have left
[03:57:10.480 --> 03:57:21.440]  now is hope all we have is hope that hope thing again screw hope screw hope i want optimism
[03:57:21.440 --> 03:57:28.080]  i want a mechanism in place where i could use my talents and my hard work to make something of
[03:57:28.080 --> 03:57:35.600]  myself in that in this country and that's what we have and it's amazing thank you anthony comia
