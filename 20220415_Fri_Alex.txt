[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:15.000 --> 00:35.000]  Mother, tell your children not to look my way, tell your children not to near my words, what they mean, what they say. Mother, can you keep them in the dark for life?
[00:35.000 --> 00:46.000]  Can you hide them from the waiting world? And of course there's father.
[00:46.000 --> 00:55.000]  Gonna take your daughter out tonight. Gonna show her my world.
[00:55.000 --> 01:15.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we are the real rebels. We are the Black Sheep. We are the Resistance. I am your host, Alex Jones, and I'm extremely honored to be here with you live on this Friday, April 15th, 2022, transmission.
[01:15.000 --> 01:30.000]  All right, here we are, ladies and gentlemen. We have Mike Adams joining us today to talk about the world economic collapse that he and I predicted with great precision two years ago and just how bad it currently is and how bad it's going to be getting
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  and how to hopefully protect yourself some from that, but we are gonna have to look now into the future and lay out the sad truths that are now inevitable.
[01:38.000 --> 01:45.000]  The question is, how severe will it be? He'll be joining me to discuss that so the latest COVID tyranny developments.
[01:45.000 --> 01:56.000]  And then humanitarian author, researcher, army veteran, Jason Jones just spent quite a bit of time in Poland and in Ukraine and those areas.
[01:56.000 --> 02:08.000]  Of course, he's been into war zones all over the world, but he is returning and he's gonna have some photos and videos and more for us to give us his take on what he's really witnessing there in studio today.
[02:08.000 --> 02:17.000]  And then, of course, the great J. Dyer will be hosting the fourth hour at Evo and Shroyer at 3 p.m. Central Standard Time today.
[02:17.000 --> 02:30.000]  All right, here's the deal. Somewhere around my house, I bought an old fashioned scale, like you see Lady Justice holding in her hand, where it's brass as a marble bottom,
[02:30.000 --> 02:38.000]  but I couldn't find it this morning. I wanted to bring it in and put weights on one side and weights on the other to decide whether Elon Musk is a good guy or a bad guy.
[02:38.000 --> 02:51.000]  But what matters is he's moving in the direction of being a good guy in so many ways. And I was mentally this morning thinking about the good things he does versus the bad things and the good things massively outweigh the bad.
[02:51.000 --> 03:05.000]  And I'm told by people very close to him, both in the military that do work for him, but also other well-known people that are friends with him here in Austin, that he is totally awake and a listener of this show.
[03:05.000 --> 03:13.000]  I haven't had a chance to meet him yet. I was out of town actually when some of my friends got to go with Joe Rogan to his factory late at night and hang out for a few hours with him.
[03:13.000 --> 03:22.000]  I got extremely envious of that, one of the few things that actually made me shake within me, just because I really do want to meet Elon Musk and I do want to pick his brain about things.
[03:22.000 --> 03:37.000]  But I was told over a year ago about Elon Musk's plan to try to restore free speech and I know some other individuals have been developing plans as well and I've been let in on some of those plans.
[03:37.000 --> 03:45.000]  And either one of these people could definitely make a move on the globalist and really restore free speech on a massive level.
[03:45.000 --> 03:54.000]  Can you imagine if Joe Rogan started his own podcasting media network? Can you imagine if Elon Musk did that?
[03:54.000 --> 04:06.000]  And I've basically got mad at Joe four years ago because I told him he could basically do that and I described for him exactly what was going to happen and what was going to unfold and he just couldn't believe it.
[04:06.000 --> 04:20.000]  And now he's fully on board because he sees it and he knows it's real and the worst thing they could do and I've told people this would be to try to take his Spotify show away because even CNN said a few months ago they said well the problem is he'll just go do his own thing.
[04:20.000 --> 04:31.000]  Yeah, he's locked and loaded for that. It's all set up. I'll just leave it at that. And Elon Musk is doing the same thing.
[04:31.000 --> 04:42.000]  So I'm going to exclusively tell you about Plan B here that Elon Musk was talking about yesterday and more, but of course you know another big sign he's a good guy or at least coming over to the light.
[04:42.000 --> 04:52.000]  And that is that they started two criminal investigations of him and his company yesterday, hours after he announced he was going to fight censorship and promote freedom worldwide.
[04:52.000 --> 05:01.000]  So we've got that here for you as well. Infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[05:01.000 --> 05:10.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand Infowars. I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  I wanted to hire camera people. I wanted to make films. I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[05:14.000 --> 05:23.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed. The first one, Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[05:23.000 --> 05:32.000]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it. We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs. So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[05:44.000 --> 05:57.000]  I almost forgot. We're selling them all at cost at Infowarsstore.com. Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost.
[05:57.000 --> 06:10.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[06:27.000 --> 06:41.000]  Here we are, embattled, wounded, but in ways stronger and better than ever. We are the Infowar. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:41.000 --> 06:49.000]  Very blessed and thankful again to be here on this live Friday the 15th, April 15th transmission.
[06:49.000 --> 07:01.000]  Let me just do this. Let me get into what we're going to cover today and then let me start plowing into it and then we have one guest in studio and then one guest over Skype, Mike Adams, Jason Jones and others today.
[07:01.000 --> 07:10.000]  This will be quite a Friday broadcast and I'm working on what time I'm going to come in on Saturday, whether I'm going to shoot a live report with everybody and take calls or whether I'm going to tape something tomorrow.
[07:10.000 --> 07:23.000]  But obviously, I've been diverted and distracted by a lot of ongoing attempts to shut down Infowars. So I've not been on air as much as I'd like to be. So I'm going to attempt to do a lot more broadcasting this week and next week and the week after that.
[07:23.000 --> 07:33.000]  And of course, don't forget the Sunday show that I've been doing for 15 years from 4 to 6 p.m. We've expanded that from 4 to 8 p.m. now calling it Sunday Live.
[07:33.000 --> 07:41.000]  But we are here on Friday afternoon on the East Coast and still the morning here on the Central and Mountain and Pacific.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  And so let me just tell you the stacks of news we have here.
[07:44.000 --> 07:59.000]  We have what is now confirmed, it broke last night, criminal investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the DOJ of Musk and his companies right after he announced that he wants to fight censorship.
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  You know, I must say he wants to help freedom in the world. Well, that is a big no-no.
[08:04.000 --> 08:12.000]  And the media is completely decrying him saying billionaires should not own any type of media outlet even though it's billionaires that own all the other ones.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  What they mean is they don't want a populist worldview or a pro-human view coming out.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  We've got all those clips and information coming up.
[08:20.000 --> 08:30.000]  There's an amazing coincidence. SEC and DOJ swoop in and investigate Tesla and Musk mulls Twitter takeover.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  Isn't that a surprise? Of course, it's not a surprise.
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  There are at least two grand juries open on me right now trying to frame me and put me in jail.
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.000]  And they've had other ones that they opened up that did not indict me last year for other supposed things I've done.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  And the fact that they can't get so far federal grand juries to frame me is a good thing.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  Because we're extremely clean around here and we're not committing any crimes.
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.000]  But you've seen the fraud in the media that I have $18 million, $16 million hidden in a slush fund.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  And I've got 400 lawsuits against me and the National News said none of that's true.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  Just total ball face lies at the next level.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  And that's because they've weaponized the judiciary and the executive and not just the executive branch,
[09:18.000 --> 09:25.000]  but the blue cities are operating as their own little globalist terrorist networks
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  to harass anybody that stands up for the country or for humanity or for common sense.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  But authoritarians will lose. They always lose.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  And so I'm glad that when the history books are written, if we survive this,
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  that my name will not be amongst the timid who cowered in their holes,
[09:42.000 --> 09:50.000]  but who was on the very front lines, the very vanguard, the very tip of the spear in the fight.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  Not because I wanted to fight, not because I wanted to be a hero,
[09:53.000 --> 10:01.000]  but because I can't take authoritarian tyrants enslaving us and turning us into their minions.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  I will either die on my feet, I'm not going to live on my knees as a slave,
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  and that's really what it comes down to.
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  And you've got to decide whether you want to live on your feet or die on your knees,
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  because you're going to die on your knees anyways.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  So might as well die on your feet.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  If you get on your knees, they're going to get you.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  In fact, you're going to lose more freedom.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  It's more dangerous to live on your knees,
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  because those that live on their knees are slaves and abused and die.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  Men and free people and prosperity are by folks standing up for what's right.
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  And we have to start doing that again, so I salute Elon Musk.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  We'll get to more of that next segment.
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.000]  I want to air a short report on CNN's treason and then come back and get into Musk.
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  We have huge news with the sinking of the Russian battleship in the Black Sea,
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  the battleship Moscow, reportedly with nuclear weapons on board.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  That is where you keep them.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  That's a big deal.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  World Health Organization Chief Tedros says Ukraine panic is racist.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  Some are more equal than others.
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  We'll lay that out.
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  Huge COVID-19 tyranny news.
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  The Pills Court reinstates Biden's vaccine mandate for federal employees.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  Main Street News reports on all the big heart attacks of microcarditis and sports figures.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  Up thousands of percent.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  We've got a lot of fake climate change news.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  Ed Buck sentenced to 30 years for torturing Black men to death and satanic ceremonies.
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  He has a Democrat after all, and so much more.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  But first, here's a very important John Bowne report.
[11:25.000 --> 11:34.000]  For the last two years, Title 42 has allowed U.S. immigration agents to swiftly expel
[11:34.000 --> 11:42.000]  more than 1.7 million migrants to Mexico, including everyone here and this woman from Guatemala.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  She asked us to call her Sandy and not show her face because she's fleeing violence
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  after two members of her family were killed.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  Do you want to know a true barometer of America's disdain for the invasion of our southern border?
[11:55.000 --> 12:02.000]  Look no further than the massive failure of the Biden administration's cheerleading squad, CNN.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  The most treasonous name in news.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  CNN is an icon of the cable and satellite age.
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.000]  CNN's abysmal failure projected a billion-dollar streaming service that would rival all others.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  It was expected to bring in a few million viewers an hour to begin with, but only managed to rake in
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.000]  10,000 gullible minions per day, which is likely more like a few hundred after CNN's 4,000 employees
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  and their families dutifully tune in.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  Now, what about the competitive marketplace, Andrew?
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  Fox News has Fox Nation, which is a lot of entertainment programming on streaming.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  NBC, ABC, CBS, they all have these free ad-supported streaming services.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  So we're doing something different, but why?
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  Well, we see a really unique opportunity for us because of what CNN is.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  So let's start there.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  CNN is a brand that's known around the world.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  Aside from the BBC, there really is no other global news organization like CNN.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  So we see a really substantial market opportunity.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  If we look at the assets CNN has, global reporting resources, expertise in video,
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  world-class talent and anchors, we see a different opportunity.
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  This catastrophe is more of a measuring of the mind of America than any poll could ever muster.
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  You can't lie to people day after day, get caught week after week, play down a child sex trafficking scandal
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  amongst your employees and expect to rock it in the ratings as the news organization.
[13:27.000 --> 13:34.000]  All the hubris of Chris Wallace and the buffoonery of Brian Stelter can't put Humpty Zucker back together again.
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.000]  So even for anyone on the left with a lick of scents, the blindfold of propaganda is slipping off of the stark reality
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  of the massive, unrelenting national security threat pummeling the United States' southern border every day.
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  A wide open border surging into the United States with the cartel's deadly fentanyl poison.
[13:53.000 --> 14:01.000]  The DEA reported overdose deaths in the U.S. had topped 100,000 for the first time over a 12-month period ending last spring.
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.000]  Last year, fatal overdoses rose by more than 40% across both D.C. and Virginia.
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.000]  In the district, this overdose problem is disproportionately impacting black residents and communities
[14:14.000 --> 14:23.000]  who make up almost 85% of all fatal drug overdoses since 2015, according to the D.C. medical examiner's office.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  To make matters in Biden's hellscape worse, we cut down all our farms.
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  We're doing fine, guess what? We're part of the reason for the global warming.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott is relocating busloads of thousands of undocumented immigrants
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  with zero understanding of our nation's laws and its deadly vices into the district of criminal streets.
[14:42.000 --> 14:50.000]  We implemented what we call enhanced safety inspections of every commercial vehicle coming across the border.
[14:50.000 --> 15:00.000]  It's snarled traffic for miles into Mexico, basically crashing economic conditions in these states as well as in the country of Mexico.
[15:00.000 --> 15:08.000]  And as they beg for relief, we are demanding that they implement security measures that will reduce illegal immigration coming across the border.
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  Have you ever been to Washington lately? They are giving Los Angeles a run at the most homeless.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  So you have these encampments, which are many cities there. What's going to happen to these people?
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  Well, these are all migrants who have been processed by CBP and are free to travel.
[15:22.000 --> 15:29.000]  So it's nice. The state of Texas is helping them get to their final destination as they await in their outcome of their immigration proceedings.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  And they're all in immigration proceedings.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  This is political suicide. What they're doing right now, it's so visible to the public.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  It doesn't matter what demographic you're a part of, you despise this and you will vote against it.
[15:40.000 --> 15:51.000]  If there are any lawmakers listening, don't stop with Washington, DC. Deliver these hordes to the front steps of CNN, MSNBC and the Mockingbird Media's headquarters.
[15:51.000 --> 16:11.000]  They will welcome them with open arms, I guarantee it. John Bound reporting.
[16:21.000 --> 16:28.000]  Shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce. We used to sell for $40. We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.000]  Whatever the shirt costs us, if a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  They cost $10 or selling it for $10. And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves.
[16:39.000 --> 16:46.000]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all. And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.000]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.000]  We've got to sell this to keep M4 Wars on the air, plus it spreads the word, infowarstore.com.
[16:56.000 --> 17:17.000]  Here is historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[17:26.000 --> 17:36.000]  It's a catch-22.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  M4 Wars and Band-Ought Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human-liberty movement worldwide.
[17:42.000 --> 17:49.000]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.

[19:29.000 --> 19:37.000]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[19:37.000 --> 19:52.000]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[19:52.000 --> 19:58.000]  So anyway, it works wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[19:58.000 --> 20:25.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  I want everybody to listen to me very, very carefully.
[20:31.000 --> 20:49.000]  Everything the New World Order does the powerful central banks with generations and generations of inbred families that are lazy and stupid, who basically inherited their power from their evil conniving but intelligent and hardworking ancestors.
[20:49.000 --> 20:55.000]  Everything they're doing is falling apart, but that makes them only that much more dangerous.
[20:55.000 --> 21:20.000]  I could have told the owners of CNN AT&T that $300, $400 million invested in a CNN subscriber system would fall flat on its face. And I would have guessed that maybe they'd get 10,000 subscribers, 20,000 subscribers.
[21:20.000 --> 21:28.000]  And that's what they've got. They've got 20,000 subscribers and 10,000 people that tune in on a regular basis.
[21:28.000 --> 21:39.000]  Now, why am I harping on this? They have almost 5,000 employees. So for every employee, they have a couple of listeners or viewers.
[21:39.000 --> 21:49.000]  Now, why are they the self-appointed fact checkers? Why are they the self-appointed censors? Because that's what they are, is a ministry of truth, a ministry of propaganda.
[21:49.000 --> 22:03.000]  And their only use now for the establishment is going around and being self-appointed tyrants that when they demand somebody is removed from the platform, they are.
[22:03.000 --> 22:12.000]  They are the most pathetic, ridiculous people you can imagine. What do you think of Chris Wallace? Already had the lowest ratings on Fox.
[22:12.000 --> 22:24.000]  There'd be 4 million viewers before him and 5 million after. There'd be 2 million when he was on. No one wanted to watch him. He was just on in the background.
[22:24.000 --> 22:38.000]  But he arrogantly thought he could go to CNN and on a subscription service have millions of viewers.
[22:38.000 --> 22:48.000]  Joe Rogan has gotten a million subscribers in a year at Spotify. That's 10 times more than anybody else over there.
[22:48.000 --> 22:58.000]  And he still wants a number a lot higher than that. It's hard to get subscribers in a modern age. They have less than 20,000.
[22:58.000 --> 23:05.000]  And no matter how much they advertise or give out free goodies and incentivize, no one's going to want to watch it.
[23:05.000 --> 23:12.000]  So now they're talking about giving the plan away free when you get an AT&T phone. Just like they used to give you HBO when you did.
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  But people really want HBO. It's got some original pretty good shows people want to watch. Even though it's a bunch of leftist crap.
[23:18.000 --> 23:24.000]  So I got all this important news and sinking Russian battleships they think have nukes on board and all this crazy stuff.
[23:24.000 --> 23:38.000]  But it's a lot bigger than just CNN. It's the arrogance of the establishment thinking they can force feed us CNN.
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.000]  And that somehow we will finally go back to being under their control.
[23:44.000 --> 23:55.000]  Once the genie's out of the bottle, once the spell is broken, there's no going back.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  And the spell has been broken. And so that's what the establishment needs to know.
[23:59.000 --> 24:05.000]  And I could use the CNN example all day, but there's many other examples.
[24:05.000 --> 24:13.000]  Now the power structure thought they just set up lockdowns worldwide, have a post-industrial world and just inject us every few months forever until we all died.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  But even in China they're rioting and burning down areas and then they're having to back off.
[24:17.000 --> 24:29.000]  Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada, Europe, they're going to have forced inoculations in Italy and in Austria, but people stood up and now they're backing off.
[24:29.000 --> 24:37.000]  The New World Order is not going so well.
[24:37.000 --> 24:49.000]  And you'd think that more people would be like Elon Musk or Joe Rogan.
[24:49.000 --> 24:58.000]  Because Joe Rogan's a smart guy and knows all the stuff I know, but chose just to not try to be a leader because he was busy and really didn't have a lot of faith in the general public to ever wake up.
[24:58.000 --> 25:06.000]  But once they messed with him and pushed him around and tried to make him their slave, well then they got the response they didn't want.
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  Now Joe's completely in their face on their ass constantly and they're scared.
[25:11.000 --> 25:19.000]  And Elon Musk has gone from doing things that make you ask if he's a good guy or a bad guy to saying we need to have more children and not depopulate.
[25:19.000 --> 25:26.000]  We need a pro-human future. Don't take the vaccine. It doesn't work. It's dangerous.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  We need to stop censorship and a bunch of other really, really good things.
[25:31.000 --> 25:39.000]  And whether he's an opportunist or not, he knows which way the wind's blowing.
[25:39.000 --> 25:48.000]  And so that's when I want all of our affiliates to know and all of our listeners to know and our viewers and everybody that you did this.
[25:48.000 --> 26:02.000]  If you have to look around the world from Bolsonaro or from Nigel Farage or from Viktor Orban or even the Russian nationalism of Alexander Dugan,
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.000]  all of those people admit that they have been influenced by Info Wars massively.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  They will tell you it's one of the main influences.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  Tucker Carlson's told me that face to face.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  Bolsonaro's son, also in the Parliament of Congress, told me face to face.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  And I already knew that. Nigel Farage had said it on the show.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  UKIP didn't explode until they started coming on the broadcast 20 years ago with myself and Paul Watson.
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  And then suddenly people opened the doors and they came to the door and they said, I've seen you on Alex Jones.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  Because once upon a time before they censored us and shut us down in most areas,
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.000]  we were rated the top 100 websites in the UK and the top 100 here.
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  So it isn't about, oh, look how special we are, how great we are.
[26:45.000 --> 26:52.000]  But historically we need to recognize what you, the listeners and viewers and our sponsors and our affiliates and this crew did.
[26:52.000 --> 27:00.000]  We were the detonator and we were the first to expose their new World Order plan on a mass scale before they launched it.
[27:00.000 --> 27:07.000]  Now they've launched it and people aren't being caught as flat-footed and people now understand who is doing all this and who's cutting their energy off.
[27:07.000 --> 27:19.000]  And when in national polls people blame Putin for the gas prices, 94% say no, we know it's greenhouse gas, go green, build back better,
[27:19.000 --> 27:26.000]  Klaus Schwab, W-E-F. They've got big polls that are people list what they think it is and they know.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  94% of people don't buy that it's Putin's fault even though he gave speeches again yesterday saying it was.
[27:32.000 --> 27:38.000]  And it's not about protecting Putin, it's about protecting the truth.
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  94% of people know the new World Order is screwing them, not Putin.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  In national polls, covered it yesterday, some are even higher.
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.000]  No one is buying it anymore.
[27:51.000 --> 27:58.000]  They have censored, they have persecuted people, they have indicted countless patriots, they have put us through hell.
[27:58.000 --> 28:09.000]  But despite that, by the grace of God Almighty, we together aren't just giving them a run for their money, we are kicking their ass intellectually and culturally.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  But here's the problem when we come back.
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  The globalists control the economy and out of sheer spite and hate, they don't care they're getting caught.
[28:17.000 --> 28:26.000]  They are destroying it worldwide, massive starvation, hundreds of millions on the edge of death, collapsing borders, just destroyed dollars.
[28:26.000 --> 28:33.000]  And this is their answer to us waking up and saying no was, a lockdown to kill the economy and hyperinflation.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  And we are just going over the edge of this cliff together now.
[28:38.000 --> 28:46.000]  And I look at people that still serve the system and still pretend that they're going along with the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN
[28:46.000 --> 28:55.000]  and are pretending you're part of the ruling elite when what you are is losers that sold yourself and your family and your culture out, believing you were on the winning team.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  You are not on the winning team.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand into a war.
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  So I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalists.
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed.
[29:14.000 --> 29:21.000]  The first one, mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.000]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[29:24.000 --> 29:31.000]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.000]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance on what I almost forgot.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[29:48.000 --> 29:56.000]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  infowarstore.com
[29:59.000 --> 30:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[30:08.000 --> 30:20.000]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains are broken down, and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[30:25.000 --> 30:31.000]  Info wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[30:31.000 --> 30:39.000]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own band with everything else, we are running out of money.
[30:39.000 --> 30:48.000]  So listen, up to 75% off at infowarstore.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation.

[30:57.000 --> 31:16.000]  Thank you for your support. You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true, that info wars is seen by the globalists as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[31:16.000 --> 31:23.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[31:23.000 --> 31:33.000]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowarstore.com, and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.

[32:14.000 --> 32:25.000]  Our immune systems have always been critical, but in this globalist era, with all the criminal activity they're involved in, it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us and supercharge our immune systems.

[33:24.000 --> 33:32.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:32.000 --> 33:42.000]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:42.000 --> 33:55.000]  So there is a globalist plan to forcibly cut off the resources and depopulate the planet, and the social engineers say they're doing this because the general public is stupid and has low IQs.
[33:55.000 --> 34:05.000]  At the same time, they dump fluoride in the water to lower IQs, they dumb down the education system to make people as ignorant and servile as possible, and then you study the ruling families of the planet.
[34:05.000 --> 34:20.000]  They are all of them into the occult, most of them into transgenderism for some reason, and are just completely dysfunctional, and Rothschilds, Rockefellers, others, they'll have like five, six kids, three of them commit suicide on average,
[34:20.000 --> 34:40.000]  half their kids commit suicide, the other ones mutilate themselves and cut their genitals off, I mean, I know a lot of them, I know a lot of people that know them, and I'm just telling you, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, California, a lot of them live in Texas, Florida,
[34:40.000 --> 34:54.000]  and they are just completely unhappy, crazy people, and almost all the mothers, in fact I saw a meme showing this the other day of a bunch of rich women in Hollywood people, raised their boys to be girls,
[34:54.000 --> 35:08.000]  they raised their boys as girls, and I remember Anderson Cooper's mom basically raised him as a girl, and then it ate, threw him in to the gay fashion scene in New York.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  His brother committed suicide, rather than I guess be part of it.
[35:12.000 --> 35:31.000]  So, these are cursed people, ladies and gentlemen, and they want to take us with them, and our children with them, and we can't do it.
[35:31.000 --> 35:51.000]  So here's a couple clips from Biden, and these are so fundamental because it's not just stuttering, bumbling, dementia, Joe, dead and sink, things that aren't true, it's his entire administration.
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  And you have to understand when you hear the word climate change, it means depopulate.
[35:55.000 --> 36:05.000]  When you hear the word climate change, it means surveillance and tyranny. When you hear the word climate change, get ready to die.
[36:05.000 --> 36:21.000]  Yeah, they actually found one of the memes, there it is, the son of Megan Fox, a girl, the son of Gwen Stefani, a girl, the daughter of Angelina Jolie, a boy, the son of Adelaide, a girl,
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.000]  the son of Charlie Theron, the son of Naomi Watts.
[36:26.000 --> 36:32.000]  So the women tell their girls they're men, and the women tell their boys they're girls, that's the big, trendy, cool thing.
[36:32.000 --> 36:43.000]  This is a sick form of human sacrifice, because they end up committing suicide at the highest rates, and again, having your genitals cut off is a form of suicide to the future generation.
[36:43.000 --> 36:51.000]  And it's a front to the image of God that you're made in. But I digress, thank you for finding that.
[36:51.000 --> 37:02.000]  What I'm getting at here is, Joe Biden goes on TV, and they put out press releases too, he's not just bumbling this, and says we cut down all our forest.
[37:02.000 --> 37:13.000]  Well, my family happens to be in a little bit of the forestry business, and I happen to study it a little bit, and I happen to stick my toe in the forestry business.
[37:13.000 --> 37:21.000]  I don't know any stocks or bonds, but I do have some cattle and a little bit of forestry stuff, and I know about the forestry business.
[37:21.000 --> 37:36.000]  I've been in it 20 years, and they'll tell you that there's roughly 40% more trees in North America now than there were when the white people arrived at Plymouth Rock.
[37:36.000 --> 37:48.000]  Look it up for yourself. It's a fact, like when they say all the polar bears are dead. There's more polar bears than ever recorded now in Northern Europe and Russia and in Alaska and Canada.
[37:48.000 --> 37:59.000]  Just look it up. There's five times the polar bears there were in the 1950s. They're expanding their range, because there's no predators for them anymore, humans.
[37:59.000 --> 38:08.000]  People aren't hunting polar bears, they should be, but it's the same thing. Oh, there's no trees. That's a lie.
[38:08.000 --> 38:18.000]  Now are there, have we cut down most of the old growth redwoods that take 500 years to grow? Yes. Should we do that? No, I agree.
[38:18.000 --> 38:25.000]  Those are really majestic and magical, and we don't need them for housing and stuff. Let's cut down smaller trees. That's my opinion.
[38:25.000 --> 38:49.000]  If somebody owns lands, got redwoods, they're yours. But it's just not true, ladies and gentlemen. It's not true. We just planted 10,000 trees on my dad's ranch where a decade ago they cut down the trees.
[38:49.000 --> 38:57.000]  They decided to have some more pastures, but now my dad decided he wants to plant trees, and the state gives you the pine trees to plant.
[38:57.000 --> 39:13.000]  We just planted 10,000 trees two weeks ago. I and my four-year-old daughter sat there for hours, sticking him in the dirt with our hands after the plow had gone through.
[39:13.000 --> 39:22.000]  But it doesn't matter. The point is that he's a liar, and anybody can verify in a minute there are more trees now than there were 400 years ago in North America.
[39:22.000 --> 39:44.000]  Just like you can verify in five seconds that the inflation is caused by the overprinting of major currencies around the world and prohibitions on pipelines where Biden worked to get Israel's pipeline cut off that was coming up into the Mediterranean.
[39:44.000 --> 39:52.000]  He got our major pipeline that he still shut down and a bunch of others, and now they're trying to – they just got the Russian pipeline into Europe. Nord Stream 2 shut down.
[39:52.000 --> 40:02.000]  So that's what's causing the energy squeeze. Putin's a little cherry on top with what's going on there, but it's the sanctions that did that. It's not Putin.
[40:02.000 --> 40:09.000]  Even if you look at the increased energy price from the war, the sanctions did that, not Putin. But so it's a lie at every level.
[40:09.000 --> 40:26.000]  So play these clips back to back. Here's Biden saying 70% of the increase in inflation, which is a spin, was a direct consequence of Putin, and then play the – we've cut down all the forest. Here it is.
[40:26.000 --> 40:42.000]  Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world. Ukraine and Russia, the one and two largest wheat producers in the world, were number three.
[40:42.000 --> 40:57.000]  They're shut down. We saw that in yesterday's inflation data. What people don't know is that 70% of the increase in inflation was a consequence of Putin's price hike because of the impact on oil prices.
[40:57.000 --> 41:12.000]  70%. We need to address these high prices and urgently for working folks out. We cut down all our forest. We're doing fine. Guess what? We're part of the reason for the global warming.
[41:12.000 --> 41:24.000]  I have The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other reports we'll cover next hour where they say climate change is making pollen season even worse across the country and the world because there's more plants and global greening.
[41:24.000 --> 41:40.000]  I crap you not. And then he tells you we've cut down all our trees and the earth is warming because we cut all the trees down. I mean, these people lie to people about the most basic stuff and it drives me crazy.
[41:40.000 --> 41:58.000]  We're going to go to break. Today is April 15th when the out of control IRS with its 16th Amendment rapes the American people. But you know that the globalists write all these loopholes into the law for themselves and that real tax attorneys very inexpensively can save you massively on your taxes instantly.
[41:58.000 --> 42:11.000]  You need to give this great sponsor a call. They're some of the best out there. I've used them. My family's used them. American tax solutions. You go to Jones tax relief.com. They have dozens of great services and they can help you file an extension.

[43:59.000 --> 44:12.000]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans. They financed major universities. They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda at the New York Times, other major newspapers.
[44:12.000 --> 44:26.000]  That the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[44:26.000 --> 44:35.000]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter. My wife makes dinner a lot of times. But I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[44:35.000 --> 44:44.000]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[44:44.000 --> 44:57.000]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions and coming together. They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[44:57.000 --> 45:10.000]  We cannot let this continue. It has been noted by many a historian. The first casualty of war is the truth. And the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[45:10.000 --> 45:20.000]  No, that invariably follows. But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and master censorship.
[45:20.000 --> 45:37.000]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[45:37.000 --> 45:50.000]  And of course now Canada is under this legislation that if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[45:50.000 --> 45:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes M4Wars.com more important than ever.
[45:59.000 --> 46:16.000]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that M4Wars is seen by the globalists as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[46:16.000 --> 46:30.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done. So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at M4Wars.com.
[46:30.000 --> 46:41.000]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you. And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that at M4Wars.com.
[46:41.000 --> 46:54.000]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now. Things have been sold out for a long time, like M4Wars Life, Fizzy Magnesium Mix that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[46:54.000 --> 47:11.000]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at M4Wars.com right now.
[47:24.000 --> 47:38.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Rogan told me years ago that Elon Musk was a great guy, and they hang out quite a bit. And he told me a year ago, he said, no, Musk is really awake.
[47:38.000 --> 47:47.000]  He basically has a lot of your same views. And, you know, he's basically in agreement with you. And I was told by other folks that work for Musk, very close to him, that he's actually a daily listener.
[47:47.000 --> 47:57.000]  I hope to meet Musk at some point. I've seen him do a lot of things I agree with some things I disagree with, but the direction he's been going in now is very, very good.
[47:57.000 --> 48:07.000]  We need to have more children. We don't need to depopulate the planet. We need to go interstellar. We need to go off world. We need to know these vaccines don't work and aren't vaccines.
[48:07.000 --> 48:23.000]  We need to stop the censorship and promote freedom. And so it wasn't hard to guess that within hours of him announcing his hostile takeover of the censorship mother ship, Twitter that they would start criminal investigations of him and his main company, Tesla at the
[48:23.000 --> 48:30.000]  Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.
[48:30.000 --> 48:40.000]  If you're a crackhead that's under the control of Chinese intelligence on record, you're fine. If you sell us out to Russia, you're fine. If you sell us out of the drug cartels, you're fine.
[48:40.000 --> 48:54.000]  If you're a child molester, you don't get in trouble. But if you build cars in America that are even the politically correct electric ones, the ones that actually look good work.
[48:54.000 --> 49:03.000]  And then you say you don't believe in censorship as must said, the First Amendment means free speech means you can say things that hurt people's feelings.
[49:03.000 --> 49:11.000]  And then the left says, no, we totally want to erase that. We totally want to get rid of that.
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.000]  By the way, that's his factory in Austin right there. It looks like inside there. It's amazing.
[49:16.000 --> 49:30.000]  That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen. So let me go to some of these clips of what he's been saying and what he's been doing. And this is seismic because if he's able to get one major outlet to not censor, it'll force all the others to stop as well.
[49:30.000 --> 49:53.000]  And we'll go back to where the Internet was five years ago, quasi free. And I love that headline about him calling the sec bastards must says us sec bastards for settlement over Tesla tweets.
[49:53.000 --> 50:06.000]  Yeah, he's bad for using Twitter to promote his company. You're not supposed to do that. You're just supposed to be like Pfizer and buy off the whole media and put a poison product on the market, you know, it's deadly.
[50:06.000 --> 50:15.000]  So here's some of what Elon had to say. Let's just play these back to back. Elon Musk confirms at TED talk that there is a plan B and I'll tell you about that after we get to these clips.
[50:15.000 --> 50:34.000]  Number two, Elon and Ted talk on why he's offered to buy Twitter and Elon says free speeches when someone you don't like is allowed to say something you don't like and then MSNBC rubbing their hands together in fear and saying that that is devastating to let people quote do what they want.
[50:34.000 --> 50:46.000]  In this case, you are not successful in the board does not accept your offer. You said you won't go higher. Is there a plan B?
[50:46.000 --> 51:12.000]  There is. I think we would like to hear a little bit about plan B. For another time, I think. Another time. All right. Sport and cowboy boots. That's a nice tease. All right.
[51:12.000 --> 51:29.000]  My my strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and and and and and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  But you've described yourself.
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  I don't care about the economics at all.
[51:33.000 --> 51:45.000]  OK, that's that's caught to here and a good sign as to whether there's free speech is is is someone you don't like allowed to say something you don't like.
[51:45.000 --> 51:58.000]  And if that is the case, then we have free speech and it's it's damn annoying when someone you don't like says something you don't like that is a sign of a healthy functioning free speech situation.
[51:58.000 --> 52:07.000]  And there are real and devastating consequences for using that platform to lie. And we've seen it. We've seen it happen.
[52:07.000 --> 52:21.000]  I wonder, you know, when talking about this, it's, you know, it's kind of funny. Oh, Elon Musk wants wants to buy it. But there are massive life and global alter and altering consequences for just letting people run wild on the thing.
[52:21.000 --> 52:33.000]  Yes, 100 percent. But that's Facebook is really the real action is in that. So that's this is a very small company people. It hasn't outsized influence because media people like it politicians, world leaders and Elon Musk.
[52:33.000 --> 52:45.000]  And so one of the issues is if he's not going to do this. And by the way, Twitter and some of its biggest investors like Prince Al Wali Bin Talal are saying no and they're putting poison pills in.
[52:45.000 --> 52:59.000]  What is he going to do? He's going to have to somehow unload this 10 percent stake. And he probably that's probably what he's going to have to do or raise private financing, which has its own risks and possible rewards, but a lot of risks for him.
[52:59.000 --> 53:05.000]  I didn't play the sound bite, but he was asked if there's a plan B and he laughed and said there is.
[53:05.000 --> 53:17.000]  Well, that's what a super villain hero would say. Right. He thinks he's Tony Stark. Right. That's what they'd say. Whatever. However you feel about him. Tony Stark would say cares for sure. It is always.
[53:17.000 --> 53:25.000]  So now Tony Stark is a villain. OK, these people are unbelievable. Ladies and gentlemen, Superman's a bad guy too. Right.
[53:25.000 --> 53:38.000]  And Lex Luthor is the good guy. You know, the guy running things. He is in charge. Actually looks like Lex Luthor. Looks like Dr. Evil.
[53:38.000 --> 53:48.000]  Where do you think the James Bond writers and people got those characters? They got them from the real world. Where do they got the character Tony Soprano for people that knew mafia families?
[53:48.000 --> 53:56.000]  That's based on real people. And that's why you go, why do they look like super villains? Because they're the super villains. Elon Musk is not the super villain.
[53:56.000 --> 54:09.000]  He's a maverick doing his own thing and he doesn't like what they're doing and they are extremely scared and upset right now because they know their system's collapsing.
[54:09.000 --> 54:16.000]  Is Musk opportunistically trying to take over the worldwide awakening and the new Renaissance because he sees it happening? Well, of course he is.
[54:16.000 --> 54:28.000]  I mean, only a moron would bet against humanity and bet with the devil. But that's what these globalists do over and over and over again.
[54:28.000 --> 54:36.000]  But just look at this headline out of Reuters. Oil rises on news. EU may phase in a ban on Russian oil imports.
[54:36.000 --> 54:46.000]  See, the West is banning their oil and gas. Now Europe says they're going to fully phase in a ban and then you wonder why it goes up.
[54:46.000 --> 54:56.000]  But even Putin's war only has made it raise a small part compared to what's happened with all the inflation.
[54:56.000 --> 55:07.000]  And if Americans and Europeans and others cannot look this in the eye and know what's causing the inflation, then we deserve to be bankrupted idiots.
[55:07.000 --> 55:16.000]  I mean, seriously, if we let them destroy civilization and cut off our energy while they laugh at us and then promise us universal basic incomes to control our lives,
[55:16.000 --> 55:27.000]  then I guess we are dumb and deserve to be gotten rid of by the globalists who are better than us. But I really don't think that's the case and I stand against it.
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.000]  All right, Mike Adams has got a lot to talk about about the organized economic collapse and what's going to come next.
[55:32.000 --> 55:40.000]  And he's been dead on. So have we and predicting all this. We're going to talk about that with him and more on the big cub in 19 police state developments and all this talk of new lockdowns coming.
[55:40.000 --> 55:49.000]  Even Democrats admit their planning. How do we stop that? That's coming up. I mentioned this climate change is making pollen season worse because there's more trees.
[55:49.000 --> 55:56.000]  See, trees are bad now. You see more carbon dioxide means more trees, more oxygen. Oxygen is evil as well.
[55:56.000 --> 56:04.000]  Got to get rid of that evil oxygen. It's almost as bad as the carbon dioxide. But let me just get this out at listeners.
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  I want to thank you for your support. I want to thank you for realizing that without info wars, all of us would be in a lot of trouble.

[57:50.000 --> 57:59.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars. I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  I wanted to hire camera people. I wanted to make films. I wanted to really challenge the globalists.
[58:03.000 --> 58:12.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one. Mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first few members of my crew.
[58:12.000 --> 58:21.000]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling. We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[58:21.000 --> 58:30.000]  We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have some t-shirts in the future. They'll just be limited editions and short runs.

[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  Trashing the lies and disinformation. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for all you do.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  Mike Adams is coming up with a bunch of big breaking news.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  But I want to get to some of Tucker Carlson last night. He just is a real treasure.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  And he cut right to the chase. He said Elon Musk is putting it all on the line, going up against censorship and saying it's wrong.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Can't have calls for violence. Don't want to push pornography on the general public without their consent.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Don't want to run scams. That's the only things that should be banned, basically. Illegal stuff.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Go back to way the laws written section 230. We've all got to get behind Elon Musk, whether he's good or bad or whatever he is.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  That shouldn't be a stumbling block for us to say we're supporting a free and open internet and a free and open debate.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. Elon Musk became famous as a businessman.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  He makes electric cars and rockets and has become the single richest person on planet Earth by doing that.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  Elon Musk is not from the United States. He grew up in South Africa and yet he has a keen and precise understanding of how our system was designed to work.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  As he put it on Twitter last month, quote, free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  And then Musk asked his 80 million followers on Twitter a very simple question, quote, do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to that principle?
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  And overwhelmingly they answered, no, it doesn't.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  So Elon Musk understands something about Twitter that many people in our country don't understand, which is it is the single most important forum for speech, possibly in the world.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  Not because it's the biggest, but because it's where elite opinion is incubated.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  And so free speech on Twitter matters. And last month, Elon Musk gave the impression that he planned to do something about it, that he planned to open up Twitter.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  He bought 10% of the company.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Now today, Musk has just put in an offer to buy 100% of Twitter at $54 to share and take the company private.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Now from a business perspective, this is a very tempting offer for the company.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  In fact, his offer represents a 54% premium over the company share price the day before he began investing in it.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  He wrote a letter to Twitter's board last night, quote, Twitter has extraordinary potential, he wrote, I will unlock it.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  So this is more than a business play.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  In fact, it's not an overstatement to say it could be the single most important development for free speech in the modern history of the United States.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  As Musk put it, Twitter's potential is to be, quote, the platform for free speech around the globe.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  Twitter will, quote, neither thrive nor serve the societal imperative in its current form.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  Musk then made it clear that he's no confidence whatsoever in the people who currently run Twitter, including its pro censorship CEO.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Quote, if this deal doesn't work, give them I have no confidence in management or do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  That means if Twitter's board rejects Elon Musk's offer, they will need to explain why to their shareholders, they turned down a deal that would make the shareholders much richer.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  So by doing this, Elon Musk is putting everything on the line.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  He knows how important Twitter is to the people who run our system, who run the global system.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  For them, censorship and propaganda are not a feature of their rule.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  Their rule depends on censorship and propaganda.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  If you are offering policies that really benefit nobody but yourself, you have to lie about them and you must prevent anyone from complaining about it.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  So censorship and propaganda are at the very heart of neoliberalism and Elon Musk is challenging all of that directly.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  He's the richest man in the world. He's not trying to make more money.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  He's not donating to a foreign charity or creating a tax shelter for himself, at least in this case.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  He's using his money to allow at least potentially Americans to speak freely.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Is it distressing that our own democratic system isn't working, that you would need some rich guy to swoop in Deus Ex Machina to save free speech in the United States?
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  Of course it is. Is it sad that we're all desperate for Elon Musk to save us? Yes it is.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  But who else is going to save us? Nobody at this point.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  So of course corporate media, which exists to stifle the views of individual Americans, hates the idea and their first move is to mock it. Watch.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  He says he wants to pay $54.20 a share to buy up the rest of Twitter that he doesn't have.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  Of course $54.20, that's $4.20, that's a code for marijuana, which he very much enjoys.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  So is this all a troll?
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in Fort Worth.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed, Gun Control Works, that helped us finance hiring the first three members of my crew.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  We're selling everything out to fund the operation, to get rid of inventory.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost, infowarstore.com.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wait till the next segment to get into the big COVID-19 plans for future lockdowns, the collapsed economy.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  We're already into it.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  How do we expose them?
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  How do we take the pressure off?
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  How do we stop the New World Order agenda?
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  How do we stop the censorship?
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  Well, we stand up and do what Elon Musk is doing.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  That's coming up next segment, Appeals Court reinstates Biden's vaccine mandate for federal employees and more.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  University host Drag Queen Story Hour for two-year-olds.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  It is all coming up, but I wanted to hit the Russia situation.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  I already alluded to some of this, some of the recap for those that joined us and then cut right into the meat and potatoes on this.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  This is Reuters oil rises on news that EU may intensify its bans on Russian oil and other energy products.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  But you heard Biden, it's Russia's fault that they put these sanctions on or blocking the oil and gas.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  Kiev rocked by explosions as Russia steps up attacks.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  Russia said the vessel sink from damage.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  They also have their battleship get sunk.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  In response to acts of sabotage by Ukrainian forces on Russian territory, the number of scale of missile attacks on objects in Kiev will increase,
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  ministry spokesman said.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  So just like Hitler was not targeting British targets at the beginning of World War II,
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  and the British, this has been declassified, said let's bomb Berlin and civilian targets and piss Hitler off to divert his aircraft to bomb cities.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  That will also get the Brits behind the war and it worked like a charm and the Russians are following in the same footsteps.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  As Hitler, Ukraine hasn't commented on the allegations.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  Residents of the Russian city of Belgrade near the Ukrainian border reported twin explosions Friday.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  The emerge of Russian air defenses hitting an object over the city where Russia's two weeks ago accused Ukraine of striking an oil depot.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  Two days ago a key Belgrade railway bridge was destroyed.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  It goes on from there.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  This is a story out that's all over the news.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  New York Times has it. Other CIA director airs concerns that Putin might turn to nuclear weapons.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Does that mean the globalists may do a nuclear false flag?
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  I wouldn't put anything past them, but the Russians could use nuclear weapons if they found a big enough military concentration to use a tactical nuke.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  The director of secrecy is in their policy.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  It's in their war doctrine to do that.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  It's in the US doctrine to use nukes first as well.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  MAD has been basically thrown to the wayside for about 10 years. That's mutually assured destruction.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  There is footage of the battleship, the Moscow, reportedly carrying nuclear weapons on fire yesterday.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  The ship sunk, reportedly hit by Russian anti-ship missiles still in the hands of the Ukrainians.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  The director of the CIA said yesterday that potential desperation, close quote, to extract the semblance of victory in Ukraine,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  contempt Vladimir Putin of Russia to order the use of tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon,
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  publicly discussing for the first time a concern that has coursed through the White House during the last seven weeks of the war.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  The director, William J. Burns, formerly the head of the Carnegie Endowment, actually runs everything,
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  who served as the American ambassador to Russia and a member of the administration,
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  who dealt most often with Putin's potential detonations of such weapons, even as a warning shot, was a possibility that the United States remained very concerned about,
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  but he quickly cautioned that so far, despite Mr. Putin's frequent invocation of nuclear threats,
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  he had seen no practical evidence of the kinds of military deployments or movement of weapons that would suggest such a move was imminent.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  He also said, the CIA director also said, that they believe and knew that Putin was going to invade in the fall.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  That was the intel I had, as you know.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  There's another headline.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  The West needs World War III.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  Martin Armstrong warns there's no return to normal.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  USA Watchdog, very important article, explaining why the globalists are cornered and need this war and push policies they knew would push Moscow into war.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Chinese forces exercise their Taiwan in response to U.S. visit, threatening to invade if the visit continues.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  China holds drills around Taiwan as U.S. lawmakers visit, and it goes on from there.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, private Federal Reserve slams China's position on the Russia-Ukraine situation.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And here's what I mentioned earlier, I want to show you this important article.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Ukraine war fears that the Moscow warships, named Moscow, Moskva, was carrying nuclear weapons when it sank.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Yeah, that's where you'd storm.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  The Moscow Soviet-era guided missile cruiser sank near the port on Thursday after Ukraine said it hit the ship with two cruise missiles.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  The director of the live-based military think tank, Edward Blacksea News, said Ukrainian newspaper Defense Experts all warn that the Moscow could have been carrying two nuclear warheads designed to be fitted to its P-1000 carrier killer missiles.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  And it goes on from there.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  So things are escalating very, very quickly in this inter-Slavic civil war that we should have no part of.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  And it's not defending Putin to tell the truth and say the West went in there and overthrew an elected government six years ago, eight years ago, 2014, and has been starting this whole thing.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  And then what did Putin do walking in to a CIA Pentagon trap?
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  I mean, there's been a major operation for a decade training of the stay-behind networks and resistance movements with high-tech weapons, A-class weapons.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  I mean, what did the Russians think was going on there?
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  I mean, did they think Afghanistan was bad?
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  Now you've got, remember the Russians fought Hitler pretty good.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Well, the Ukrainians are basically Russians, most of them are.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  I mean, it's Russians killing Russians.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  It's not going to go well.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  And of course, Zelensky's horrible and the whole thing's terrible, but the Ukrainians and the Russians are now like two pit bulls killing each other.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  And it's just disgusting.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  The people that put them in the ring together are the bad ones.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Well, who set the dog fight?
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  Who did it?
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  George Soros, the globalists, they're the ones, and they're the same ones trying to cause a race war in this country.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  So there's a race war and white people and black people are running around killing each other.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  Those doing it are bad, but who's really bad?
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  The corporate media and the establishment and those that set the table, those that prepared this, those that did this, and those that bragged they did this.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Absolutely insane.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  So there's all the clips of me making the rounds all over the place.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  You know, saying six, eight years ago, we're going to start a proxy war.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  The Russians are going to be lured in.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  It's going to go for years.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  It's going to cause energy prices to explode because that's all in no brainer when you've got all the pieces of the puzzle together.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  And remember, Biden said earlier today and yesterday that all the inflation, it's all Putin's fault and that the climate change cut down all the trees.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  It doesn't even make any sense.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  It's all lies and now they're blaming increased allergies and pollen on the fact there are more trees because of global warming, which it's not global warming.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  It's increased CO2 a little bit and trees do grow a lot better with more CO2 and produce more oxygen, which again is a good thing part of life on this planet.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  We're going to go to break.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  I'm going to come back.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  Just want to remind listeners that one of our best selling products, Brainforce Ultra,
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  the last few runs sold out very, very quickly.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  We've got a limited run in it.

[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  That's what I like.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  I can take it at night and still go to sleep later.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  It is back in stock.

[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.

[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  M4 Wars, it's paradoxical, is more popular than ever.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  It is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.

[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  Then fresh back from Ukraine, former army veteran and humanitarian aid worker, Jason Jones will be in studio with us here today ahead of Jay Dyer and Owen Schreuer and others coming up here on the M4 Wars network.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Let me get a few of these headlines and go to Mike because I want to get into the economy, the worldwide lockdowns are trying to push again and more and the latest on the COVID poison.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  Here's some of the headlines. Axios appeals court reinstates Biden's vaccine mandate for federal employees. See they're coming back.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  Here's market watch appeals court reinstates Biden's federal employee vaccine mandate. Incredible.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  Pfizer and buy in a tech target healthy kids as young as five for COVID booster shot.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  Update big report on info wars.com. A jaw dropping 769 athletes. OEMs confirmed have collapsed while competing over the past year. Average age of players suffering cardiac arrest 23. Unpressing. It used to 100 a year will be incredible. It's been over 700 defiance of COVID lockdowns growing in China.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  That's just some of the news here. The health ranger Mike Adams joins us. Mike, great to have you with us so much to cover. You'll also later in the hour get into some big developments on the whole venom story.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  Is it accurate? Is it is it partly accurate? Is it wrong? You've got some really conclusive stuff that's coming up last segment of this hour into the next hour. Mike Adams, thanks for being here.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  Well, thank you, Alex. It's always great to join you. And yeah, we can start out with food inflation. The FAO saying it's over 12% month over month. And if if people are familiar with the rule of 72, it means that in six months, food prices will double in the United States.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  If those numbers hold, which means in 12 months, they will quadruple from where they are today. I mean, think about that, Alex, what that's going to do in terms of food riots and uprisings in the US and all around the world if they don't bring inflation down.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  And let's be clear, it's an absolute known fact that when over 50% of your paycheck is spent on food, you get societal collapse and war. And it's already starting around the planet where that's happening. And we're on line to do that.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  You can see why Klaus Schwab says an angry old world will bring in the great reset, which means the collapse of society and their build back better program.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  Well, and remember that a lot of this was set off by the wartime economic sanctions against Russia, which halted, you know, the delivery of some natural gas, which is necessary for fertilizer production.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  I know you've covered that extensively. And then without the fertilizer, you have a well scarcity and then rising costs to fertilize crops all over the world.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  And then you have more scarcity of crops because a lot of farmers choose to not plant crops. And then the crops they do plant can go up in price significantly, which is exactly what we're seeing.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  So it's important for people to understand that what has already been set into motion, including the economic sanctions against Russia by Western nations.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  This will spell really inflation doom for the next one to two years affecting food supply, energy supply, and of course many other things.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  And then I know you want to bring this in, but the Shanghai lockdowns in China, which I believe are contrived in order to punish the West.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  That's also going to worsen the supply chain disruptions and make it almost impossible for American companies to get supplies or to even build homes to acquire resins or electronic parts.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  I mean, Taiwan companies that operate in China have had to shut down their factories so they can't even ship out of Taiwan now because they can't get their stuff out of China.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  And let's spend some time on that because I know you're a wife of Taiwanese, you speak Chinese, you publish books in China, you've got a lot of employees over there.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  Big picture, what is Yixi Ping doing? They're threatening to invade Taiwan right now. Obviously this is all contrived for over a few thousand asymptomatic cases, total lockdowns.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  It's obviously a domestic martial law drill, but what's the geopolitical reason?
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  Well, in my view, Alex, China is trying to punish the West. They're trying to break the economies of the United States and Western Europe, and they're willing to lock down and really murder their own people in order to achieve that.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  Remember that the Shanghai lockdowns are not only affecting the port operations, they're affecting domestic trucking, which means that the supply chain to the factories in Shanghai is also now completely broken.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  You can't even get a supply truck from somewhere else in China to come into Shanghai to supply a factory there.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  So this also means that you can't get containers for international shipping, even in other countries such as Taiwan and Japan and South Korea, which have their own exports, but they're having a very difficult time getting containers because they're all log jammed in Shanghai.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  So this is a really dangerous supply chain shutdown, and I think, Alex, I think that China is trying to collapse the dollar and then to have the gold-backed yuan or digital currency, or maybe a digital renminbi backed by gold, to dominate the world.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  And they are re-establishing trade with Russia, with Turkey, with India, and even with Saudi Arabia.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  For TV viewers and radio listeners, this is giant tower blocks, people howling and screaming wanting out.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  We thought this was fake two years ago, but now it's confirmed they're doing it again.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  These are giant cities, lockdown, wailing, begging to be let out, a giant exercise of pure evil, videos of thousands of cats and dogs, reportedly millions being killed, of thousands being rounded up and their brains beaten out.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  This is authoritarianism.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  It is absolute tyranny. It's the template for what they're going to try to do in America later this year, I believe, because remember, with the food inflation, you're going to have food riots, and they're going to have to bring in price controls and food rationing.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  And at some point, the riots are going to get out of control in certain cities, not everywhere, but in certain cities where they've defunded police and they have advocated an atmosphere of lawlessness, you're not going to be able to run a grocery store.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  So the grocery stores will shut down, convenience stores will shut down, they will just leave, and then you're going to have populations trapped in US cities with no food supply.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  That's coming for America later this year.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  That's right, they know the economic collapse is coming.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  These major power bases are vying for who will get the new world currency, who will have the new vaccine passport, carbon tax, multi-pass system.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  And so China is drilling for the collapse they know is already coming and doing it early to make sure we collapse as well. It's very simple.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  Well, right, and recognize, I know you showed the video of the little creepy robot dog in Shanghai speaking commands to people, like, let go of your dreams of freedom and things like that.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  And, you know, there are robots enforcing masks at airports in the United States now.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  We got that report coming out today. We just went up to the love field. Seven-foot Sentinel robots screaming at people to keep their mask on.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  They know if you lower the mask under your nose and public schools now put the same robots in.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  Well, exactly. So we're looking at the first stages of the robot takeover of society and the shutdown of humanity.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  What China has decided is they don't really need the 25 plus million people in Shanghai in order to maintain control as the Communist Party.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  In fact, it is in their interest to have millions of people die.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Well, that's right. It was what three leaders back to one after Mao said we would benefit from a nuclear war with America that they actually want to get rid of their people.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  Well, right. And think about how quickly America will fall if we don't change course here because the United States does not even.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  I mean, let me put it this way. When the West put economic sanctions on Russia, the Russian people have for decades lived under some form of sanctions.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  They've learned how to adapt. They've learned how to trade. They've learned how to be more self-reliant and to get by with less stuff.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  The American culture is exactly the opposite. The American culture is psychically fragile.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  We've been getting by on materialistic abundance because of the petrodollar status.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  And when that materialism vanishes, which is in the process of happening, most Americans are going to panic about having to survive without an instant, you know, Amazon.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  I agree. Stay there. It's not if it's when how do we survive and stay with us?
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse. I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  I wanted to hire camera people. I wanted to make films. I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed. The first one, Mass Murderers Agreed, Gun Control Works, that helped us finance hiring the first few members of my crew.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  That's our oldest design that we're still selling. We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  There'll just be limited editions and short runs. So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  I almost forgot. We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com. Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  Over the years, info wars has produced more than 200 amazing Patriot Americana, Second Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags, you name it.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now. That's just regular plain change shirts.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce. We used to sell for $40. We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20. Whatever the shirt costs us, the shirt costs $5. We're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  It costs $10. We're selling them for $10. And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves. We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again. We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:59.000]  We've got to sell this to keep m4s on the air plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com. Here historic apparel now infowarstore.com.

[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  Domestic terrorists.
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  The days of independent media are numbered. The government has made it illegal to oppose them. They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  The traders know they can shut us down by force. But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially. So be it. Make them silence us by force.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  This is the final battle of the information war. Give now. Buy products. Donate. Before everything changes.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  We need you to carry us through to the end. Victory or death. Go now to infowarsstore.com.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  So this is just mathematics. If you cut off the fertilizer, if you cut off the oil and the natural gas, if you lock people down around the world, it's going to cause a collapse.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  And so there's no doubt we're in a collapse. There's no doubt we're in inflation and hyperinflation.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  The question is how bad will it get in different sectors of the world and what's coming here and how do we get ready?
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  So we're not here scaring people, as Mike was saying. We're here warning you about the facts like, hey, the next gas station is 50 miles away, you got 20 miles of gas.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  You're going to run out of gas. So the question is what are you going to do?
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Mike, we have lived under freedom so long, as you said, a lot of Europeans, a lot of Russians, people in Africa, Latin America, they're used to having to figure out how to survive.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  As you said earlier, what happens when the average spoiled rotten American wakes up to the nightmare they're in?
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  I think they're already waking up and you've got Biden with 20-something approval ratings, 94% of folks blame him for inflation.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  So it looks like the Lib Tarbs are finally starting to get it, but is it too little too late?
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  Well, I think it is because the other thing that's going to be set off by this is a massive wave of starving migrants from South America and they're going to be coming across the border because of what Biden is doing to open up the border.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  And as the food inflation and fuel inflation worsens, these people are going to suffer collapse in their own nations in Central and South America and they're going to be streaming into North America.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  So if people thought the situation was bad right now in terms of illegal immigration and a migrant invasion, it's going to get far, far worse.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  And even leftists who maybe were in favor of having a lot of migrants to come in because they tend to vote Democrat, they're going to lose their minds as these migrants start taking over their cities and towns farther and farther north.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  So we're really looking at a global collapse of the ability of people to buy food and fuel.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  And if you look at the implications of that, it's going to be riots and chaos. I mean, Sri Lanka is already in riots and they've already defaulted on their dollar bond debt payments, and that's going to spread all around the world, Alex.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  And also Europe's going to be hit very heavily with a massive wave of starving migrants from the Middle East and also from Africa.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  And the UN admits that they ran the policy with the lockdowns to do it. Now they pose as a savior.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  And for people that don't know, here's the bottom line. The globalist now we have just on time delivery, a very complex economy.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  And as long as you leave it alone, it does great. But you artificially break it up, you block it, it's going to then cause chain reactions that are almost irreversible.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  And so this is already a done deal. The only question is how bad will it be? And welcome to the technocracy, welcome to the post industrial world where the corporations themselves are using their control of the supply chain to annihilate society while they double and triple their wealth.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  Because that's the key. All these top millionaires massively increased their wealth during this operation. They just ran on us.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  And if the public is as smart enough to get that, they better wake up fast or they're dead.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  You're exactly right. And these supply chain breakdowns are also going to permanently destroy literally hundreds of thousands of small businesses across America.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  I interviewed a business owner just the other day asking about these questions. He is able to adapt and barely able to get supplies and keep his business operating.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  But a lot of businesses, once they hit one month where they can't get supplies, just one month, and you know, as a business owner, you know how cash flow is so critical, many of these businesses will have to liquidate so they will sell off the equipment.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  They will lose the employees and they lose the knowledge base of how to make things or how to provide services.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  And that's a post industrial world. And let me explain that. I know you sell a lot of great supplements, raw goods and products like we do.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  We buy from some of the same people because you use some quality as well. We used to get stuff in four weeks and six weeks and 10 weeks.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  Now 20 weeks out. And now it's even further out. And how do we take money and put it out that far?
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  I'm having discussions now about just selling out what we've got because then we could operate six, eight months a year.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  And saying, OK, this is how long we can operate instead of putting money forward and starting to collapse slowly.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  I mean, I'm literally looking at the decision right now and it's not just us. It's every business person that isn't Walmart, isn't Target, isn't Amazon.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  They're positioned to continue on. But everybody else is going to be out of business.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  You're exactly right. And I know that your company used to be able to get terms. I know that because the same is true with me.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  You used to be able to get like, you know, 30 day terms on receiving supplements or raw materials.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  No, they want it up front. They want it up front and they can't even give you what you're asking for, right?
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  You're seeing that all the time, I would imagine. So, you know, it's killing us.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  You want to order 50,000 bottles and they say, well, we have enough materials for 5000.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  Or you have a multi ingredient formula that may have seven or eight ingredients in it and there's one that's missing.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  So you can't run the formula or you have to reformulate, which means you have to relabel.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  But then guess what? There's a shortage on the bottles and a shortage on the lids.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  I mean, we had to repackage a bunch of things and we couldn't get like squeeze lids or spray.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  Oh, that's why a lot of our black bottles have white lids. Just can't get black lids.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  Exactly. Right. So this is what China is making worse.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  I mean, if you think about it, China's Shanghai lockdown is actually hurting Info Wars supplement business.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  And I'm not saying that's China's main goal. Obviously, they're trying to hurt everybody, but you're hurt.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  I'm hurt. We're all hurt because of this because, you know, all of these plastics and the residents to make plastics, they come out of China.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  But there's the mistake, you know, going back to Richard Nixon recognizing China and dropping the recognition for Taiwan.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  Taiwan is like the Texas of Asia. Taiwan is the free China.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  But Nixon switched to China and then he took us off the gold standard.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  And from that point forward, the United States was headed for collapse because we'd lost the manufacturing base.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  Absolutely. So now we're not talking about it. Inflation's here. Food shortages is here. It's going to get a lot worse.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  What's your timetable? How bad it's going to get, Mike?
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Well, the food scarcity is going to really appear in the second half of this year in the United States.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  The inflation is already going to be very, very bad. We will see food riots this year.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  And I'm predicting food rationing passports next year in the United States with price controls on certain items.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  So that's going to get, you know, Venezuela style in the United States.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  However, some of the worst damage could be reversed if we change course very quickly.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  So if, in whatever way, if Biden were removed and somebody who knew what they were doing, you know, a business person,
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  somebody who had experience in business, oh, Trump perhaps or someone like that could come in and just start being rational,
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  we could avert the worst case scenario. But time is running out.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  And again, folks, Mike Adams and I don't want to get up here and tell you this, just it's fun to tell you scary stuff.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  We've been proven right. And you've told us the scenario you see happening, I concur.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  You told us a better scenario to wake up and say, no, what's the worst case scenario, though?
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  Well, the worst case scenario, Alex, and I almost regret that you're asking me that because it's, this may not be the most likely outcome,
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  but the worst case scenario is the total collapse of human civilization. I hate to tell you.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  I've even, you know, been trying to prepare people for how to live without technology at all.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  Now, remember that if we lose the natural gas creative fertilizers, we lose 4 billion people just in terms of who we can no longer feed, right?
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  And that's not debated. You're right. That's not debated.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  That's not debated. Right. And Michael Snyder did a great piece the other day.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  He said we only have a 90 day supply of food on planet Earth at any given time. It's a rolling 90 day supply.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  So if you lose fertilizer and then 90 days later, basically 4 billion people.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  Well, I should say 90 days after the harvest, 4 billion people will no longer be able to feed themselves.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  If you lose, excuse me, combustion engines and diesel fuel to drive tractors, then you lose about another 2 billion people.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  And remember, while they're dying, a large percentage of them become homicidal cannibals in all the studies.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  That's where society breaks down. That's where you lose the complex structure of modern civilization.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  They could bring down all of society, all of civilization in a worst case scenario. Let's hope it doesn't go there.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Which is what these environmental post humanist terrorists have set up Klaus Schwab.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  This is an extinction rebellion from the top. You are witnessing the shutdown of civilization.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  We're desperately trying to stop it, folks. There isn't a more important broadcast out there than what we're doing with Mike Adams right now on naturalnews.com.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com. Please take this live interview and share the link.

[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  I'm not going to stop as they're lovingly called, but since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  People think I'm 55 years old. And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well maybe that's what I need to do.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  Because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  The newest product from InfoWarsLife is now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com.

[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  Welcome to the next hour with a shotgun.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  He's going to Elon Musk and his big fight against the sensors.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  But right now I want to get into the snake venom story that's been so viral and Mike Adams researching it and seeing what's actually true.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  We're going to cover that now, but separately, we have over 100 designs of t-shirts, a lot of which I never promoted or even pushed,
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  I've never even seen, but just sit there in our warehouse.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future shirts coming in.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  But these are all limited editions, so once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those,
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  and that's it for all these hundreds of designs forever.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  All the other shirts are at cost to clear inventory.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  This one is $24.95, really nice fabric.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back, infowars.com.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  Fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  This is a limited edition shirt.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  We are going to sell a limited number of these, and then they are gone forever.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  Show them the back, the back's really cool.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Infowarsstore.com, Alex Jones was right.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  It's $24.95, so we make like $19 or whatever to fund our operation on it.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  It's a gorgeous shirt, we're really proud of it.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  A limited edition, fund the info war, get a piece of history now at infowarsstore.com,

[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  You can't do that in a better way than wearing an Alex Jones was right shirt with infowars.com,
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  big on the back, available now for a limited time, infowarsstore.com.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  Okay, going back to Mike Adams of naturalnews.com.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  Like Monday, my phone started blowing up with this whole snake venom thing,
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  and I like Dr. Artis, and I like Stu Peters, and I looked at it, and I'm trying to figure it out,
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  and then I had Dr. Fleming on the X-Day about it.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  From your research, I know you're a scientist, and I really respect you and your trailblazer.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  What's really going on?
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  Is this a right herring, or is it part true or all true?
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  What's happening?
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Well, I think the great service that Dr. Brian Artis did, and Stu Peters did for the world,
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  is to bring to our consciousness the concept that venom is used in drug development.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  And so I've actually taken that and gone off in that direction of really, really researching
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  how many pharmaceuticals are based on venom.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  And I sent a table to your producers, they can probably show it as we're talking,
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  but it shows that there are venoms from rattlesnakes and pit vipers that are used in pharmaceuticals
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  and that millions of people every day are swallowing reptile venom as a medication.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  Some of the venoms come from magical cone snails, I'll talk about that in a second,
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  as well as scorpions.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  There were drugs being researched using vampire bat venom,
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  and let's see also the Gila monster venom, which comes from their drool.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  So there are diabetes drugs right now made from Gila monster lizard drool.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  It sounds outlandish to people, but that's just because they don't know the state of the art.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  Well it's like saying they've got animal human hybrids, but it's on MIT's website,
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  they just don't show them to us.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  So there's a huge industry in the venoms of reptiles and snails.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  Well exactly, now where this gets even more interesting and kind of feeds back into some of the things
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  that Dr. Artis was alleging, and I understand his views are controversial on that,
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  but let me just add this, there are two companies, and I'm not assigning any nefarious intent to these companies,
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  they're just part of the industry, they're called Venom Tech and Toxin Tech.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  Venom Tech is located in the UK, Toxin Tech is in the United States,
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  and these companies specialize in cataloging venoms, toxins, and poisons
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  from over 150,000 animal species around the world that are known to be venomous,
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  and they make these peptide libraries available for drug discovery in pharmaceutical companies.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  They also license their libraries to cosmetic companies as well as agricultural companies to research for use in pesticides.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  But here's the thing, Alex, these peptides, which are again derived from animal venom,
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  these peptides, when someone licenses that library, they get the protein sequence of the venom peptides.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  And if someone with ill intent were to license that library, and then, let's say,
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  get involved in gain-of-function research, they could engineer a snake venom peptide into the payload of a virus.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  That makes perfect sense.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  Yes, or they could put it into the instructions of an mRNA therapeutic injection.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  And this is what Dr. Artis is alleging that he believes has happened,
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  and what's fascinating is that even scientific American appears to confirm that there is a very strong similarity
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  in the protein sequences, the codons, in SARS-CoV-2 versus snakes.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  In fact, snakes were the best match.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  And so the question and the theory that's circulating right now is,
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  were animal venom peptides combined with other elements in order to create a weaponized payload
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  as part of the SARS-CoV-2 research or engineering program to build a bioweapon?
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  And then secondly, has it been engineered into so-called vaccines, which are actually mRNA injections?
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  And then finally, Alex, thank you for letting me speak on this.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  But finally, if this is true, and you've covered this, that there is transfection,
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  which means there's alteration of your DNA by the code that's in the mRNA encapsulated instructions.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  This could mean that human beings, at least some of their cells, are being turned into reptilian hybrid cells
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  that are producing reptile venom inside your own body.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  So there's your human reptile transhumanism theory laid out.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  Fascinating.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  Just in general, COVID overall, they want to bring back the lockdowns.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  They want to inject children. The number's coming out.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  They hope we just forget about COVID so they can bring it back later.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  And just overall, what are the other big COVID stories you're looking at, Mike?
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  Well, of course, there's the return of COVID and of masking, excuse me, in the lockdowns.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  And just as you had predicted many months ago, they're going to bring back something even more aggressive.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  There's no question about it. Probably before the midterms is what it looks like now,
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  because they want to push more mail-in ballots.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  So I think we should hunker down and be ready for something far more aggressive.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  Yan Limong from Hong Kong, she's spoken about this with her China Intel sources as well.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  So we need to be ready for something more aggressive, perhaps a hemorrhagic fever type of virus.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  Well, remember, she predicted that and then all of a sudden they started fear-mongering about it in the news.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  Yeah, but I think her Intel sources are legitimate and I think they're just waiting for the opportune time.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  And they could combine that with, you know, food riots or some other form of instability
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  that breaks out spontaneously in the United States because of what we discussed in the last few segments.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  Well, here's the $60 trillion question, Mike.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  If we expose this to Davos Group and Schwab and Gates and Dasik of the New World Order, then they can't carry it out.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  I mean, isn't it life and death who expose they're the ones doing this?
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  I mean, it's just such an arrogant, crazy thing for them to try to collapse society and admit they're doing it.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  And as if we're all just going to sit here and let them carry it out.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Isn't exposing the fact that it is a conspiracy critical to stopping it?
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Well, absolutely. Exposing it is key.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  I know I'm stating obvious.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  I'm just saying everybody needs to understand that these people did this on purpose.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  They released it. Now they're getting ready for more stuff.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  They're not going to stop. It shows how crazy they are.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Yeah, and I think they're going to attack us in multiple vectors.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  And by the way, on the venom peptide story, those companies that I mentioned, they brag about how they, all the venom peptides are easily stabilized.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  So they can be stabilized for delivery in multiple vectors or other upcoming attacks, perhaps, such as contact surfaces in the food.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  Yes, even in the water, but in the air, aerosolized release.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  You know, I mean, we're talking about venomous peptides and also poisons, some poisons that are skin penetrating.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  As you know, remember the EcoHealth Alliance proposal to DARPA?
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  They wanted to have the skin penetrating toxic nanoparticles released in the bat caves in China.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  So we know that technology exists.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  And we also know that technology exists to mass synthesize these peptides at will.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  That's been around, you know, for decades.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  And once they've got all their robots, like we found in Ukraine, drones with spray bottles spraying something on people who knows what they're doing.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  There's just a lot of mad scientist stuff happening.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  And the thing is, you know, they've been poisoning us for years with fluoride in the water.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  So we know that mechanism has been in place and that willingness has been there.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  And then secondly, we know that the globalists are trying to depopulate the planet and they're using, you know, climate fear mongering as an excuse.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  Just like you were saying earlier, it's like cut down more trees or something. It's crazy.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  But CO2 is what's going to keep our planet alive.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  And so that's why they are at war with CO2.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  I mean, we need more trees, more food crops, higher levels.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  These people really are the ultimate villains.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  They're merchants of death. They're all satanic.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  And they're trying to absolutely destroy God's creation, which is Earth and human beings created in the image of God.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  And also human DNA. You know, don't forget, as you know, the symbolism of the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization,
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  it's a serpent spiraled like DNA around a staff of power.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  So it's right in your face. They're telling you what they're going to do.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  This is the ultimate arms race, full control of reality, God-like power.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Two more segments with Mike Adams.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  We're going to talk about Elon Musk and more, but first I want to head on, nanotech in the food.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  They reported on a year ago. They said, do it. Now it's all over the news.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  Not just that, they're now fertilizing things with dead bodies in the U.S.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  We used to sell for $40. We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  Whatever the shirt costs us, the shirt costs $5. We're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  It costs $10. We're selling it for $10.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited,
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  limited edition in the future.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  M4warstore.com, here historic apparel now, M4warstore.com.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  M4warstore.com is a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  to be able to post their content free of charge.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  And because it becomes so successful, it's a catch-22.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  M4war's and Band-Aid video have become a mothership
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  promoting the pro-human-liberty movement worldwide.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  But the expenses in Bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter,
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  So, the biggest sale in M4war's history is going right now,
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  the emergency blowout sale, let the 75% off,
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  get incredible products and keep M4s as strong as ever.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:59.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:08.000]  Already into hour number three on this live Friday, April 15th transmission.
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  Look at some of these headlines here from The Epic Times, Reuters, you name it.
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  Nanotechnology used in COVID vaccines, 2,000 foods goes unlabeled.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  That just broke last month.
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  Nanotechnology programs at the FDA, they just admit, they said the sky's the limit.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  Anything you want, put it in the food, the water.
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  U.S. food supply, dirty secret, American food fertilizer, which remains
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  and laced with nanoparticles.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  Now, technologyfacts.fda.gov.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  Guidance for industry, there is no guidance.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  It's all right there.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  I will wash all my food like crazy,
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  scientists voice concerns about nanoparticles
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  for the first time being found in children's brains.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  Their approach to regulation is no regulation.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  Mike Adams, Health Ranger, we see Harari at the WEF saying
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  they're colonizing us with nanoparticles.
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  This is really the revolution.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  It's not just this injection.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  It's not just this graphene oxide.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  This is a takeover.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  Well, absolutely it is.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  And I'm glad you brought up the fact that there is alkaline hydrolysis,
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  which is the liquefaction of human bodies,
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  turned into what I call the flesh goo,
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  goes into the municipal sewage systems,
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  it's turned into biosludge, and it's spread on food farms all across America.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  It's absolutely true.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  I did a whole documentary on that years ago.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  It is, and if you think about everything that people take...
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  Have you think we get sick from eating cows that ate cows?
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  All the studies, as you know, the type of prions that are in humans,
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  you do not want to be eating humans.
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  And they would say that the prions are destroyed through that process,
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  but it's not always the case.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  And it only takes one to begin the protein folding process that destroys your own brain.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  But think about this, Alex.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  We were just talking last segment about how pharmaceuticals are made from reptilian venom,
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  and they're FDA approved pharmaceuticals.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  Well, those go through people's bodies.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  Those go into the sewage system as well.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  So it's not just birth control pills.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  It's not just hormone replacement therapy drugs.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  It's not just dead bodies that are in the sewage.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  It's also snake venom as part of pharmaceuticals.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  And so all of that is being spread on food farms.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  All of it.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  And this is what's growing your conventional food products in the United States.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  And almost nobody seems to understand this process.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  It's astonishing to me.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  People don't understand that their water in one city actually was the toilet water
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  from another city upstream, and it was just treated.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  But was everything removed?
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  No.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  I mean, people out there are still drinking tap water for some reason, which is bizarre.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  I mean, that's incredibly toxic.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  So, you know, water filters, you've got to have them.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  Absolutely got to have them.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  And you've got to focus on clean food, which is why I tell people, grow what you can,
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  not only to survive, but also because you know it's clean.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  Well, that's right.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  The left mocks me when I sell high quality water filters that totally cut the toxin on.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  That's like laughing at a scuba diver having a scuba tank on him,
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  or laughing at somebody, you know, taking a vitamin.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  I mean, it's so crazy how toxic the water is.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  Only a crazy person would not be filtering it unless you live in a mountain area
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  with a well of clean water.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  Because even in agricultural areas, there's all the pesticides and herbicides
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  that get into the water.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  Everybody should be filtering their water.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  The idea that you shouldn't is just it shows they're out to get us.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  And they will, when they attack your supplements business, they'll claim you're selling snake oil
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  while they, big pharma, are selling snake venom.
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  And it turns out snake oil actually has really healthy fatty acids from the snake skin.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  It's actually a nutritional product, but snake venom is a neurotoxin or a hemotoxin.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  You know, it kills prey in seconds.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  So, I mean, would you rather sell nutrition or poison?
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  Absolutely.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  So this shows how crazy they are. I want to talk about Elon Musk when we come back.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  But in 30 seconds, what do you think is going to happen with Biden?
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  Well, I think Biden absolutely is going to be removed.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  I think that Hunter Biden will eventually be indicted and Joe Biden will have to resign
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  and he will be pardoned by Kamala.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  And then I think Kamala will be replaced because there will be a scandal
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  that comes out of her history in California.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  There's my short answer.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  I 100% agree with what Mike Adams just said.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds with the conclusion of Mike Adams.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  Then Jason Jones, fresh back from Ukraine, has got key intel straight ahead.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  Infowars.com.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand Infowars.
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  I've been on here a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  And I wanted to hire camera people. I wanted to make films. I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed. The first one, Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works,
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  that helped us finance hiring the first members of my crew.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  because whatever stock we've got in, that's it. We're selling everything out.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  To fund the operation, to get rid of inventory.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future. They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at Infowars.com.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts,
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  they're all selling at cost. Infowarsstore.com.
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  Clashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  Well, Elon Musk is a mixed bag, but he is pro-human, he says.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  He says, have more children, don't depopulate. Watch out for the vaccine.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  We shouldn't have censorship and a lot of other good things.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  And now, Elon Musk has come out and said we need to stop censorship.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  It's un-American. It's dangerous. I want to buy Twitter.
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  And within hours of him making that announcement, the Securities and Exchange Commission,
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  the DOJ said he's under criminal investigation.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  Mike Adams from naturalloves.com is here, really cuts through all the propaganda,
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  right to the heart of the matter, a respectful opinion.
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  I don't think we can overplay how big this Elon Musk move is.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  I don't think we can over exaggerate that this calls out the impurge, new clothes,
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  the elephant in the room, and shows the censorship that's going on,
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  and it shows that other billionaires like Jeff Bezos are involved in the censoring.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  I think it's a very bold move. What do you really think is behind it?
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  Where do you think it's going?
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  Because obviously, the big move is to be anti-censorship, pro-human.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  That's what everybody wants. That's what's popular.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  That's what gives us a pro-human future.
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  When do we see rich people, the richest man in the world, we're told on paper.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  We know there's old money bigger than him, but this is really a major assault
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  on the New World Order, in my view.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  And as Tucker Carlson said, Elon Musk is putting it all in the line.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  Do you concur with that, Mike Adams?
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  Yeah, absolutely. 100% support what Elon Musk is doing right here.
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  And it appears, I believe he's doing it for the right reasons.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  And I want to say that if indeed, Elon is dedicated to this,
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  this new revolution of free speech online, I believe he will absolutely succeed.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  There's nothing that Twitter can do to stop him.
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  They can slow him down.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  They have adopted the poison pill measure in order to try to dilute the power of shares
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  that Elon might acquire.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  But that's not going to stop Elon if he's dedicated to this.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  And once he acquires Twitter, here's my suggestion.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  He should open the doors and let all of the left-wing censors walk out,
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  and then he should call for volunteer pro-America moderators who can work for free,
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  who are happy to protect free speech for free, serving as volunteer moderators.
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  Twitter could save a fortune on the human resource costs.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  Twitter would become instantly more profitable,
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  and then Elon Musk's shares would skyrocket in value.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  And then each day of the week, he should bring back someone else.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  On Monday, bring you back.
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  Tuesday, bring back Trump.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  Just each day, have a new person that is brought back to life on Twitter,
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  and it'll be unstoppable.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  Yeah, they're talking about the stop going up ten times when we brought Trump or Alex Jones back.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  I mean, obviously, this is the thing to do.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  Well, absolutely.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  And, you know, I would never go back to Twitter under its current ownership,
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  but if Elon Musk were running Twitter, I would absolutely return to the platform
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  and use it responsibly to share the truth about what's happening in the world.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  I would use it.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  And I think that's shared by you and many other people.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  I know Trump maybe is a little bit skeptical about going back to it because he has his own platform,
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  but I bet that would change.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  If Elon Musk said, hey, Trump, come on back.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  You're welcome here.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  Your voice is important for America.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  I think Trump would use it.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  Let me ask you that question.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  CNN spent over $300 million, 300 cash, about 100 million infrastructure, 400 million plus
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  to launch a service that gets 10,000 viewers a day.
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  And they say over the week, it's even less in the aggregate.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  Isn't that a bellwether of how dinosaur corporate media isn't dying?
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  It's dead.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  How do they think they're going to respond?
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  Because they can censor us.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  They can take our bank accounts, but nobody's going back.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  Nobody's going back to this abusive relationship.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  People are flown the coop here.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  That's right.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  And they have to keep subsidizing channels like CNN in order to just keep them online.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  Organically, nobody wants to watch CNN.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  People are tired of being lied to.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  And so there is a desperate demand for truth tellers.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  And that's why Twitter actually has tremendous long-term value potential once it is run by
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  someone like Elon Musk, who is dedicated to the idea of allowing both sides to participate
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  in every debate.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  And that must include Ukraine, vaccines, you know, federal reserve policies, politics,
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  you name it, elections.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  You need to be able to hear from both sides.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  And as he says, that's essential to the survival of our very democracy.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  And I agree, but how transparent is SEC and Justice Department criminal investigations
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  in hours after he stands up?
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  I mean, that is ridiculously obvious, Mike.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  Well, I think you know more than anyone how the federal government has been weaponized
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  against truth tellers and patriots.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  So yes, I mean, the FBI ran the Governor Whitmer kidnapping.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  That's essentially been proven in court.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  The DOJ is weaponized against conservatives.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  The SEC is weaponized against Elon Musk.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  And he's known that for a long time.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  He's lashed out about that.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  So, yeah, we have to overcome that.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  But the good news is we can.
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  We have the resources.
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  We have the ingenuity.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  And Alex, I'll say this, you know, you are a much greater person today because you've
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  had to adapt to the attacks.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  You are more resilient.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  You are more resourceful.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  You are, you know how to run a business on essentially a shoestring budget, even though
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  I know it's tens of millions a year, but it's a shoestring compared to what CNN is spending.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  And once this has unleashed this power of American entrepreneurship and the resilience,
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  we are unstoppable.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  I totally agree with you.
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  In closing, I had a lot of questions in the last four minutes, but what else is on your radar?
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  What else are you concerned about?
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  What else are you looking at over at National News?
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  Well, I mean, all kinds of topics, but right now we're very concerned about the escalation
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  of Ukraine and Russia, you know, the sinking of that flagship and then Russia's response
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  to that, the bombing last night of Kiev, which is highly unusual.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  We have a correspondent in Kiev that confirmed that.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  So that's not just propaganda.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  It was like, yeah, big explosion, not far away.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  So I think the escalation is very, very dangerous.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  And Joe Biden needs to be removed, not just him, but his handlers need to be removed from this equation.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  We're going to end up in a very devastating world war, possibly with a thermonuclear exchange.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  And finally, it is absolutely true based on my sources that there are numerous former U.S. military personnel,
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  French military, UK military who are about to be captured in the southeastern Ukraine.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  And they're going to be prisoners of war.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  Now they may not officially be working for the Pentagon, but they, they're, you know, recent Pentagon employees.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  So the Russians have cut that pocket off?
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  Absolutely.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  They're completely surrounded.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  They have no resources.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  There have been multiple attempts to rescue them.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  Those have failed.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  So the question is, what's Russia going to do with these Western former military leaders when they are prisoners of war?
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  And I don't, I don't have the answer to that, but that's coming.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  If the Russians are smart, they shouldn't parade them.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  They should just release them and say, you should stop doing this.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  Because if they parade them, that's going to piss Americans off.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  I think Putin should just release them and say, Americans, you shouldn't come here and attack us.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  I think that would be the, the most Christlike thing to do.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  And I think it would counter the propaganda.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  The wise actors in this scenario will work towards de-escalation.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  And I think Putin, although he's made a lot of mistakes and I don't agree with the things that he's done, obviously,
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  but he has withheld some things, many things that he could use in an escalation.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  And it seems like the Western nations are absolutely pushing for escalation.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  So we're in a bind, but also the people of Ukraine are caught in the middle of this.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  The people of Ukraine that don't support either side, they just want to be left alone just to, you know,
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  buy food and raise their families and run their businesses.
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  And sadly, they are being slaughtered in this process.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  No, I totally agree.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  So how does, how does Putin get a face saving way to get out of there now?
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  That, that's really the question.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  We'll be covering all that.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  Mike Adams, naturalloves.com.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  Thank you so much for that friend.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  And please come back more often.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  I try to get you on all the time.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  Thank you for being here.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  Thank you, Alex. I always happen to join you.
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  Thank you. All right, folks.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  I sleep good at night knowing Mike Souther has his own daily show.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  He's a writer in Central Texas.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  We really appreciate it.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  We got Jason Jones, who runs major humanitarian groups, filmmaker, author.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  He's going to be in studio, lives here in Texas, fled Hawaii now at police state.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  He just went to Ukraine.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  He's going to be with us next segment.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  Hey, this shirt.
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  All the other shirts in a pair are limited edition.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  They're selling out.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  Once they're gone, they're gone.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  They're at costinfowarstore.com.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  I want to thank viewers and listeners that are supporting us and going and getting them.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  Because my big blind spots order in too many shirts and having too many and they're just sitting there.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  But a lot of shirts are best sellers.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  This will be a best seller.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  Big red Thunderbolt on the back, infowars.com.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  We are selling it for $24.95.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  So we make like $19.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  I guess the shirts a little bit more expensive.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  They were, correct me, like $17. It's a nice fabric, nice shirt.
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  The cost is like eight bucks or something.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  The point is, we need funds.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  infowarsstore.com.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  Get your Alex Jones was right shirt.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  Limited edition to keep us on air.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  Limited edition.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  Alex Jones was right for men and women.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  infowarsstore.com.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  It is the Alex Jones was right fundraiser shirt.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  We need funding now.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  And Brainforce Ultra is back in stock, 40% off.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  You know, it's a fact and I'm out bragging when I say it.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  It's just true that infowars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products.
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  Thousands of them at infowarsstore.com.
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  Don't need me to tell you that at infowarsstore.com.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  Things have been sold out for a long time like infowarslife,
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarsstore.com right now.
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  For your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  I have a few ideas.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  First of all, I'll suggest that when you fall into a form,
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  arrest out, arrest while swab.
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  The vaccine is poison.
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  There's tons of things.
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  I'd say just keep it short.
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  Keep it concise.
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  No, I agree.
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  Beautiful.
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  Yeah.
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  There's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be affected.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  So that's what I'm calling about.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  God bless you, Chris.

[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  Jason Jones is a father of seven, a grandfather of two.
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  He moved from Hawaii to Texas recently.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  He's here with us for tomorrow's news today.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  He's an author, filmmaker, or when he filmmaker, he just got back from Ukraine.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  And so he's here with us now.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  I'm glad you got back safe.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  Wow, you sent me a lot of crazy photos and videos.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  Maybe we'll play some of those later, but tell folks what you witnessed in Ukraine.
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  Yeah, it was really heartbreaking, Alex.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  The reason I went is, you know, my organization is still every day rescuing people from Afghanistan.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  And you're an army veteran yourself, so you can speak with it.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  I am an army veteran.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  We've been rescuing people from Afghanistan since August.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  We're still doing that every day.
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  We've gotten a lot of news coverage.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  You've covered it, and we've gotten a lot of coverage.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  So when Russia invaded Ukraine, we got inundated with requests from Ukraine or from families in the United States
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  to rescue their loved ones from Ukraine, including an NHL hockey player.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  But then we got requests, an odd request from a Catholic religious order.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  It's not an odd, but an unexpected and uncanny request.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  A side effect, a consequence of putting the women and the children on the trains
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  and sending them west alone gave an opportunity to human sex traffickers.
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  There were gangs of Chechen and Albanian sex trafficking gangs.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  But that's coming out.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  Yeah, this is true.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  So you were in the middle of that.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  Tell us about it.
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  Yeah, we were in the middle of that.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  So what happened was a religious order, a convent of Catholic nuns had asked us
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  if we could help facilitate shelters so that these young women who they were being told
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  they were going to be taken to Poland or Germany or the United States,
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  but in fact, they were being trafficked.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  So we've now set up a system.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  We have 1,800 beds.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  We're already at capacity, we're looking to do more in the next week or two.
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  And obviously it's more than just beds.
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  But what we're doing is working with human rights activists, Ukrainian leadership,
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  mayors of cities.
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  We've set up these facilities so these young women, many of them were orphans
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  between the ages of 13 and 16 that were let out of the orphanages
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  and just because of sheer panic and sent away from the Russian troops,
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  but they were sent to the west alone where Chechen gangs were waiting.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  And that's the classic Islamic thing.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  And I know you say Muslims as well, that's good, but it's like classic thing.
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  Albanians, sex trafficking, others, they even have PBS documentaries
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  where young 10, 12-year-old girls get on line and say, hey, get on a plane.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  Come here.
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  They get on a plane.
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  They disappear forever.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  And this is happening in Ukraine.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  And you said that the first casualty of war in the run-up to this segment
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  is truth and innocence.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  And it's really uncanny because I've been writing a lot.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  I wrote an article today on the poison gaslighting, Joe Biden's poisonous gaslighting.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  He's actually killing Ukrainians with gaslighting.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  They're making all these promises and commitments of help,
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  but because they just want a quagmire.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  They will give the Ukrainians enough support for this war to go on for two decades.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  That's what they want.
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  They want to move Vietnam.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  Brookings Institute said it publicly.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  John Smerich over at the stream detailed the Brookings Institute published,
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  and they said the quiet part out loud.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  They put the quiet part in print that with glee that maybe this can last a decade.
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  They want a war in Ukraine for a decade.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  So it's not only that they don't want any information that's quote, unquote,
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  pro-Putin.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  Any information that would create...
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  The taunt.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  The taunt.
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  Any information that would lead to a negotiated peace agreement,
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  that's going to be forbidden.
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  And then they're going to paint that as your Putin troll
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  when really what we want is we want peace in Ukraine.
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  So what did you witness over there?
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  You know, the hardest part, Alex,
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  is we didn't go to where any of the violence was happening,
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  but the hardest part was just to see the mothers and the children
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  who had fled leaving their husbands behind.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  And just to see the look in their eyes.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  And these are...
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  You know, I've witnessed this in Afghanistan.
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  I've witnessed this in Iraq.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  I was there in Iraq during ISIS.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  I witnessed this in Sudan.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  But there's something when you know that these are upper middle class people.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  Some of the people we rescue, they follow me on Instagram.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  And I'm like, they live in bigger houses than me.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  You know, they're surgeons or engineers.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  And here now, their daughter, the one woman that we had rescued,
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  had traveled with her one year old for three days
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  to make it to the border of Poland.
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  And then we were able to put her...
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  By God's grace, one of our evangelical pastors in Berlin, Germany,
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  or in Germany, was helping us with some of our Afghan refugees
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  that we had resettled, was then able to resettle Ukrainians for us as well.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  But Alex, it is really heartbreaking.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  And I think the one thing that we all need to advocate for is peace in Ukraine
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  as soon as possible.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  Peace for Ukrainians.
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  Ukraine does not exist to advance the interests of the West.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  Exactly.
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  We're against what Putin did.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  It doesn't mean we agree with Soros and them making it a quagmire for a proxy war.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  How do we get Putin away out?
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  How do we disconnect this?
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  You know, I think we need to be...
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  We need to push back on the gaslighting from the American establishment
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  that is going to offer them no real help.
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  I mean, they say it.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  Zelensky came out and said,
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  I was told that you will never be a part of NATO,
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  but we want to put it on the table so Putin thinks you're going to be a part of NATO.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  In other words, we want you to be a punching bag for a decade.
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  We want to bleed Russia and Ukraine for a decade
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  to serve our perceived national interests.
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  And obviously, if we know that, Putin knows that.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  So why the hell did he go in there?
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  You know, for the life of me, I don't understand it.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  It's the catastrophic mistake.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  I think the only mistake that we could look at in the past 100 years
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  is similar to this as Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  that has pushed 40 million Afghans into hunger,
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  many millions into starvation,
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  and empowered the Taliban, the Haqqani network.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  And you've been there and your group is there.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  What's happening in Afghanistan?
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  Alex, thank you for bringing that up,
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  because Afghanistan...
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  More people will die in the next 12 months in Afghanistan
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  than the last 12 months in Afghanistan
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  that will die in Ukraine
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  because of the hunger, the famine,
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  the total collapse of civilization.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  The mainstream media that tells us they care so much about Ukraine,
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  they just skipped away from Afghanistan
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  as if nothing is going on there.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  What do you make of the WHO had Tedros saying,
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  it's basically racist, we only care about Ukraine,
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  because they're white, I think he misses it,
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  because there's nuclear weapons and it's Russia,
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  and it's Europe, but still,
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  we do ignore all the major conflicts happening.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  Yeah, we skip away from disasters.
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  I tell them, my Ukrainian friends,
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  that are really hopeful that the United States
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  will step up and defend them,
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  I'm like, why don't you call our references,
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  check our references, call South Vietnam,
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  or maybe you can give Iraq a call,
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  call the Kurds, call the Christians in Syria in Iraq,
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  call the Yazidis, call the Uyghurs,
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  call Afghanistan, check our references,
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  and see if we're going to be trustworthy,
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  if you can count on us to be your authentic partner,
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  or if you're just a means to an end for us.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  And you'll be left out to hang.
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  Left out to hang, and the mainstream media,
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  the way we skipped away, Alex,
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  the way we skipped away from Afghanistan,
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  every single day, all day,
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  my staff has to deal with desperate pleas for help.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  Young women, Christian women,
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  women that work for human rights organizations,
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  men that work translators or work with American troops,
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  have been hiding in attics, hiding in farms and barns,
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  starving to death, freezing to death since August.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  But the mainstream media refuses to cover this,
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  because it doesn't serve their agenda.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  You know, I look at how,
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  why are we, Poland should win the Nobel Prize,
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  that's the one thing I saw, Alex, the Polish people,
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  the hospitality and kindness that they are providing
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  to the people of Ukraine as they come across the border,
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  is unlike anything I have ever seen
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  and to witness it up close and personal,
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  I say too bad that Afghanistan isn't bordering Poland,
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  because we would have a much easier job
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  of resettling these Christians and others
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  that were resting in Afghanistan.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  Now, Poland is doing such an incredible job
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  caring for these people.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  Germany and Spain and Portugal are accepting
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  the Ukrainians.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  Why is it, Alex, that we are now resettling Ukrainians
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  in the United States in 72 hours,
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  but there are American citizens,
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  the minor children and spouses of American citizens
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  that have been abandoned in Afghanistan
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  and the media has moved on, the State Department has moved on.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  Jason Jones, that's a good question.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  Let's answer that when we come back.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  Stay with us with Jason Jones.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  It was about 25 years ago
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  that I wanted to expand in Fort Worth.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  I've been on the air a couple of years,
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  but I only had money to finance my own
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  simple little local radio show.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films,
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:12.000]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  The first one, Mass Murderers Agreed,
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  Gun Control Works, that helped us finance
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  hiring the first two members of my crew.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  We have that design over 100 others
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  that will now all be limited to issues,
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  because whatever stock we've got in,
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  that's it, we're selling everything out.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  To fund the operation, to get rid of inventory.
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts,
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  this is your last chance.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  I almost forgot, we're selling them all
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  at cost at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie,

[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  they're all selling at cost at infowarstore.com.

[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  loatium root, and more.
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  This product is incredible.
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  InfoWars immune support, exclusively available
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  at infowarstore.com, is funding the tip of the spear,
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  the InfoWars operation.
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  It is a 360 win.
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:47.000]  The only way you fail is by not taking action
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  and keep InfoWars on the air.
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  Now, infowarstore.com.
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  There are thousands of independent journalists and groups
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:30.000]  to be able to post their content free of charge.
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  InfoWars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  promoting the pro-human-liberty movement worldwide.
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  But the expenses in Band-Wid alone are millions of dollars a quarter,
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:48.000]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[2:31:48.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  So the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now,
[2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:54.000]  a mega-emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  getting credible products to keep InfoWars as strong as ever.
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  MUSIC
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  William in California, people are asleep and programmed controlled.
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  I agree. How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  Can I plug, uh, Alex, real quick?
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  I'm in my 60s, and I did the work of 25, 30-year-olds,
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  and I worked them into the ground, and you wanted to know why.
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  And I've tested this, and I've taken your B12,
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:34.000]  I really do. I take that B12, and I am electric, man.
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  I can run 10 miles.
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  I did some pretty heavy work with a highway department,
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah,
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70,
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  and I know I'm not just blowing smoke here.
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  The B12 saves my life.
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:58.000]  MUSIC
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:05.000]  it's Alex Jones.

[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  MUSIC
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  MUSIC
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  Jason Jones is here with us on the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  He's a filmmaker, big filmmaker, big author,
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  and a humanitarian, there's a lot of aid work around the world,
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  and he was just in that whole conflict unfolding
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  and just got back here in the U.S. from Ukraine,
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  and I was saying, what's the bottom line?
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  And you said, well, the reason I came here today,
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  I'm about to tell him, so the reason you're here today,
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  Jason Jones.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  Yeah, so you always offer me a platform.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  You see, come on whatever you want,
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  and when I was in Ukraine, we were texting back and forth.
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  I said, you know, Alex, I'd like to come in on Good Friday,
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  and the reason I want to come on Good Friday...
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  I forgot, it's Good Friday.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  It's Good Friday, and the reason I wanted to come on Good Friday
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  was really driven home to me even more this week.
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  You know, we met and became friends when I was first
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  stumbled across a movie set that was purporting to be
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  a COVID testing site in February of 2020,
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  and then again when I was arrested leading a protest in Hawaii
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  in the first week of the first shutdown.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  But then you let me come on here, you didn't know at the time,
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  you knew I was a filmmaker, you didn't know that I worked
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  for the Uyghur and ran a human rights organization
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  advancing the interest of the Uyghur.
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  But I wasn't aware of who your films are.
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  You knew my movies, yeah, and most people know my movies,
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  which really my movies came after my activism.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  My movies are really a part of my activism.
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  My wife says, let people think you're a movie producer,
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  they're impressed by that. No one's impressed by you
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  parachuting into Syria, but they love your movies.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  But you always gave me a platform to stand with the vulnerable.
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  And the gospel of Jesus Christ, our Christian faith,
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  really disturbed the world in two fundamental ways.
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  The first thing was the incarnation of the second person
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  of the Trinity, taught us the inviolable dignity
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  of every human person. The king is not God.
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  He's not a demigod. In fact, he's actually more than that.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  He is a creature made in the image and likeness of God
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  that has an inviolable dignity. That's what Caesar is.
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  But that's what the homeless person is.
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  That's what the class is. Exactly.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  That's what all of us are. And Alex, the other thing
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  the gospel did, it taught us our equal dignity,
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  which shatters traditional societies.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  When the gospel moves in, it turns the whole world upside down
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  as Paul said of Jason the Greek. You turn the world upside down.
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  You'll turn the world upside down.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  But the second thing really comes together with Good Friday,
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  which is we have learned through the passion of the Christ
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  to not deny truth and to never abandon the vulnerable
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  because we see Christ himself was abandoned by those
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  who adored him, who loved him, and who knew him
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  like Peter denied Christ in the crowd.
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  And the reason I wanted to come on today, Alex,
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  was just to thank you for allowing me to talk to millions of people
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  about the Uyghur, to allow me to stand up for my state.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  I can tell you people from Hawaii email me every week.
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  I love it. I love it. Alex, talk to you.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  Can you tell Alex to tell us this is still happening?
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  Alex is our only voice. We should go to Hawaii and expose us.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  That's a beautiful place. I'll be there the whole month of June.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  My daughter's getting married. Fine, I'm going to come in.
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  But Alex, you've never abandoned the vulnerable.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  Then when I see my dear friend Ali Alexander on your show,
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  and I know very well that your lawyers know that you're just saying,
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  hey, listen, just silo yourself, take care of yourself.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  But there you were last week when I was in Europe,
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  I see my friend Ali being ripped apart by conservatives,
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  being what he said being misrepresented.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  You know, and there is a line of gesture in your show
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  and in who you are, Alex, and that is the same guy
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  that would abandon Ali Alexander is the same guy
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  that will stand with the Uighur.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  The cries when I tell him about what's happening to the Muslim Afghans.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  Well, that was a main line of conservatives not getting it.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  When they order you to appear for a grand jury,
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  they arrest you if you don't.
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  The left said, oh, he's cooperating. He's an exposed Trump.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  He didn't do that. He's been ordered to testify he is.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  And they spun that like, he's a traitor.
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  No, I'm being ordered to do. They'll arrest me,
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  and then I'll tell the truth.
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  And then they're saying he's expanding the investigation.
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  For you to believe Ali Alexander is expanding the investigation,
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  you have to believe there was an insurrection,
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  that there was no insurrection.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  Ali Alexander is not expanding an investigation,
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  but yet you had him on your show.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  You brought him in at that moment of his greatest vulnerability.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  And I wanted to come on last week just from Poland
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  when I saw this whole story before I saw this break,
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  just I wanted to thank you.
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  No, I want to thank you, brother. So how do we just big, big picture?
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  How do we help the people of Ukraine?
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  How do we help the people? What do we do?
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  I mean, because obviously, Biden isn't listening. What do we do?
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  Well, we need to work for, we need to work for negotiated peace.
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  There needs to be peace. And we have to...
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  A ceasefire and a peace deal.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  The Deep State, the Klaus Schwab, the Brookings Institute,
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  as they throw gasoline on the fire, as they bang the war drums,
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  as they make every promise in the world to...
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  800 million weapons a week.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  Yeah. Well, meanwhile, a thousand Ukrainian Marines
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  had to surrender because they were out of ammunition.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  So do you believe that? Do you believe that?
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  Look at Afghanistan.
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  On July 6th of last year, Joe Biden looked America in the eyes
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  and told one of the biggest lies in the history of American politics.
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  He said Afghanistan will not fall.
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  When he said that, 85% of the districts in Afghanistan had already fallen.
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  Why do... It's like, it's like Biden is trying...
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  because he's perfectly hurting himself.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  It's like, he's got to get a win sometimes.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  Why is he just... Because as much as I hate Democrats,
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  I don't want to see them ruin the country.
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  Their failures are failure. What's wrong with him?
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  Yeah, and who's suffering?
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  I mean, the people are suffering every single day in Afghanistan.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  There are 40 million people in Afghanistan.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  When I was on your show, and I think there's video,
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  I hope I shared it with your staff,
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  of food delivery that we did to thousands of people because I was on your show.
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  I've seen it so many times.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  I hope they're showing it now.
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  These are families that were being fed because I was on your show.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  Thousands, we fed about 350,000 Afghans through the winter.
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  There are 40 million.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  And whether they're Christian or Muslim, you help them.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  That's Christ's life.
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  That's how I share the gospel with Jesus Christ.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  Sometimes Christians will say,
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  Are you sharing the gospel with them?
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  Yeah, by treating them as God would want me to treat them and loving them.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  And of course, they will follow you.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  Well, you know Jesus will give him food.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  100%.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  Yeah, and he will stand with them.
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  But see, Alex, that's the line of gesture.
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  We can't stand by Nick Sandman and Kyle Rittenhouse.
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  We've got to stand by the J6 defendants and Ali Alexander.
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  We've got to stand with you.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  We've got to stand with Elon Musk.
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  This guy just hit the nail on the head.
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  He, he said, number one, we have to have more babies.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  That's what the deep state, their number.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  He's going against it, isn't he?
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  Population control.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  He's going directly against it.
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  He said, we're going to let you tell the truth.
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  Because if we don't, it'll collapse with them.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  We'll have babies.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  But this is not new for Elon Musk.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  He said his interest in space was this idea that sooner or later,
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  if we all have big, beautiful families, we're going to need a place to go.
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  Let's colonize the universe.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  I agree.
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  And he said,
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  That's really our big mission.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  We're going to look back on our ancestors will and thank us,
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  but they're going to be everywhere.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  We're going to do incredible things.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  We're going to ask, why do they try to stop us doing this?
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  We're made in the image of God.
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  C.S. Lewis said, if we could see each other as who we were,
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  we would fall in awe or in horror of what we can make of ourselves.
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  So transhumanism is real.
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  When they tell you that they're going to live to be 200 years,
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  don't think that they can't,
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  well, we won't be able to do that.
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  Absolutely, it's all real.
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  We're made in the image of God.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  We have God like power.
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  We're made in his image.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  Remember, I remember as a child talking about cloning.
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  Oh, that'll never happen.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  It happened.
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  We talked about, you know,
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  can you imagine if we had a phone like they had in Star Trek?
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  It happened.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  I heard a comedian once say that, you know,
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  if they invented a flying hoverboard,
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  like they have in Back to the Future,
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  there'd be a line outside the Apple store for a week
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  and then we would just accept it as normal.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  But we do amazing things.
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  But then the next day,
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  We're made in the image of God.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  There's no doubt.
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  That's it.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  And so we need to order ourselves,
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  which means God made God had children.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  And that's really what we are.
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  We're his.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  Yeah.
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  And then Jesus Christ.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  We've got to be tested before we get all this power.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  Yeah.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  That's right.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  We have such a beautiful dignity.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  And now it's the reason why my favorite audience in the world
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  is the Alex Jones audience,
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  because it is the most,
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  they talk about diversity.
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  This is the most diverse audience on the planet Earth.
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  On the externals,
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  but the internals, goodness,
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  a hatred of cruelty,
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  a love of truth and justice.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  This is what this audience is.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  So to be here on...
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Exactly.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  We're racially diverse,
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  but homogeneously.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  We love God.
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  Culturally.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  People come up to me,
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  you know, when I'm on your show,
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  they thank me for being on your show.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  They tell me they love you.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  I've had Catholic cardinals
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  and I've had people that are New Age.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  I've had my friends that go to BLM protests
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  and friends of mine
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  that are like state chairman of the Constitution Party.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  And they all say,
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  Alex Jones is my guy.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  This is the guy that tells the truth.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  And this show is really the nexus of Alex Jones.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  I just saw Tucker Carlson say,
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  Alex Jones is right.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  And I know...
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  Hinton Tucker's doing a great job.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  He is.
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  He's something else.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  But see, that's what courage does.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  It inspires other people.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  But it comes at a great risk.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  And so we need to stand with you.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  We need to stand with Elon Musk.
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  We need to stand with the Uyghur
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  and Chinese concentration camps,
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  the people in Shanghai
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  who are having their faces stomped in.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  All of our destiny is knit together
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  because, as you said first,
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  it's going to be a prison planet.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  They're not going to wall off East Turkestan
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  and say that's where the prison is.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  No, it's going to be a prison planet.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  We're all going to be in that prison
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  and we're all going to be free.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  And so we should be in solidarity
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  with those who are suffering A,
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  because they're made in the image and likeness of God.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  But B, if we let them stay slaves,
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  our grandchildren will be slaves.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  That's right.
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  Stay with us.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  We're selling them for $15,
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  If a shirt costs $5,
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  we're selling it for $5 for access to produce.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  If it costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  And we've got hoodies,
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  and we've got long sleeves,
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  and we've got short sleeves.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  We've got them all,
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  and we've got to liquidate them all.
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  And they're limited edition
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  because we're never going to make any of these designs.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  We've got to sell this to keep in force on the air.
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  Plus, it spreads the word infowarstore.com.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  Here, historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  that's wild harvested above organic
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  in the volcanic soil,
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  that, you know, the media calls communists,
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  but really, they're just a commune.
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  And whatever the point is,
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  And I've been buying it for, what, 14 years,
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  and the price has never gone up.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  for about 50% more per pound.
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  you're going to find anywhere.
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  Um, we had like that.
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com.
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  And that's how we fund this operation.
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.

[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us

[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true,
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  that InfoWars is seen by the globalist
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  as the standard of human liberty,
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  as the logo of human populist resistance
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:17.000]  And man, our work is really right now
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  we've got great products, thousands of them,
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  at infowarstore.com.

[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  And so now we need to support more than ever
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  because this fight has intensified.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  Don't need me to tell you that at infowarstore.com.

[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  like InfoWars Life, Fizzy Magnesium mix that's so amazing,
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:47:14.000]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarstore.com right now.
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  What's most important in this final segment
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  for Jay Diartix, however you said?
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  Well, really, the mission of what you're doing,
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  but also we'll talk about J6 and the attempts
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  to outlaw political opposition in this country.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  Please continue.
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  Yeah, I think J6, the mission of my organization
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  is to stand with the most vulnerable people in the world
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  when it's most difficult.
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  And I had a real test last year
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  because a friend of Oli Alexander, for example,
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  I didn't know Oli.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  I knew he was a very influential guy,
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  a buddy of mine introduced us,
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  and I thought his platform would be a great place for me
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  to bring the message of three million Uighurs
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  in concentration camps called Oli.
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  And he said, yeah, you can come speak at my event.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  It's not really what we're about.
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  And then when this all went down,
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  and I knew other people went down,
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  I thought, should I call them, should I email them,
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  should I reach out to them?
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  I was afraid.
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  You know, like Peter was afraid, again,
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  going back to the passion.
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  There's Christ.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  The woman is like, you're one of them.
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  I'm not one of them.
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  I don't even know this guy.
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  I'm out of here.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  And I thought, you know what?
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  I'm going to call you every week.
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  Ali said you were so annoying
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  that you were reaching out to me so much.
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  But these J6 defendants, if we cannot stand with them,
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  we shouldn't stand with anyone.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  Well, we're next.
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  I mean, they're branding Americans as terrorists
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  for protesting peaceful ones,
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  and they admit it's for all of us next.
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  Yeah, how is this that mothers
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  at school board meetings are terrorists?
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  Then a guy wearing a gas mask lets out smoke
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  and starts shooting people.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  And we are comforted that this was not terrorism,
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  and he is not a terrorist.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  But a gentleman that would went into the Capitol
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  and walked in a circle and respected the velvet rope,
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  we are told as a terrorist.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  And Congress is, everyone is investigating him.
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  What we need to do is leave no one behind.
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  We need to order our lives to stand with the vulnerable.
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  My organization, our website, is thegreatcampaign.org.
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  And if you want to help us continue
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  to support those Christians and vulnerable people
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  in Afghanistan and the families and the women
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  that are facing trafficking in Ukraine,
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  because the Putin and the Deep State
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  have conspired together to use Ukraine,
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  like Hitler and Stalin.
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  Split up Poland.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  Poland is nothing, but this Poland exists for our ambition.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  And the Deep State and Putin see Ukraine for their ambition.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  And that's exactly right,
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  because the State Department and Biden said,
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  go ahead and invade, we won't do anything, remember?
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  Oh, and they said, we're going to make them part of NATO.
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  They never had any intention of Ukraine being a part of NATO.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  They did everything to get Putin to invade.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  They did.
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  You cannot deny it.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  And that takes courage to say,
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  because you say that and bing, bang, boom, you're a Putin troll.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  They don't care that I'm, you know, right now raising
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to carry Ukrainians.
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  If I say the truth, that Biden's gaslighting is as poisonous.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  You're trying to turn off what's happening.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  You're helping people, but you're trying to stop it.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  That's the best way to help the people.
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  Yeah.
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  And gut level, Jason Jones,
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  you're a smart guy and a veteran all over the world.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  How do you see this Russia thing ending?
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  I think the Ukraine thing just keeps escalating.
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  You know, the ball is in our court.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  Isn't that sad?
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  Like the plight of the people in Ukraine.
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  Oh, that's even the news.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  The U.S. military is running operations there.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  Yeah.
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  Well, I don't even know if that's the case.
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  I think they may be feigning they're running the operate.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  I think they're going to give Ukraine as much support
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  as they need to keep the war going forever.
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  Do you remember what Kissinger said about the Iran-Iraq war?
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  He said it's too bad they both can't lose.
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  Yeah.
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  Those are human beings.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  Those are villages and families and schools.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  But they had to hurt both groups.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  Yeah, too bad both can't.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  And Iran-Iraq would have fixed things if they just came together.
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Did you imagine?
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  What did we get out of that war?
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  We didn't get anything good for us.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  What are we going to, we as the American people,
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  going to get out of a 10-year war in Ukraine in Russia?
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  Nothing, but...
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  No.
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  So we as the American people need to put a break on this
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  and they encourage a negotiated peace to end this war.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  Putin needs to leave and Klaus Schwab and his gang
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  need to get out and stay out.
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  And we want a free Ukraine, an independent Ukraine,
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  a peaceful Ukraine.
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  Not a Ukraine, again, is nothing but an instrument
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  to the ambition of powerful, elite...
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  A vast warground for divide and conquer proxy war.
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  Talking about Klaus Schwab,
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  he wanted to launch their world government collapse
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  with it and not get to blame.
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  He's getting to blame everywhere.
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:44.000]  I see that really messing up their operation.
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:46.000]  Things are falling apart.
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  Look, evil is a deprivation.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  It's the absence of existence.
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  It's the absence of being.
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  Ideologies of evil will collapse on their own.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  So what do we do?
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  Tell the truth.
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  The human person has inviolable dignity, beauty and worth.
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  We want kindness.
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  We want justice.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  We want every family in the world to be as safe as ours.
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  Well, the first thing I did when I got home
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  into my little neighborhood in the Hill Country of Texas,
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  it was startling just how peaceful and safe it was.
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  And I thought, you know, where was I just 72 hours ago
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  looking at women with this sorrowful...
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  I can't even explain the look, the sorrow...
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  It makes you know how thin the veil of civilization is.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  Now we take it for granted.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:24.000]  Yes.
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  Yes.
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  And again, every day still in Afghanistan,
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  I get messages, people begging for help, crying,
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  getting messages that people that we were sheltering
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  had tired of being sheltered, wandered out,
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  tried to go back to their village, were captured and killed.
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  But of course, the media is not covering this.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  So we need to continue to be the voice for human dignity,
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  to be the voice for the vulnerable,
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  to stand with the vulnerable no matter what the cost.
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  And look, Alex Jones, look at who's rising up.
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  People like Tucker Carlson.
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  This is a different guy than the guy we first met
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  with the bow tie and the neo-conservative talking points
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  when he was a younger man.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  Look at Elon Musk, the daring and the courage.
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  And so we all just need to step up.
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  Sometimes we're tired.
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  I think of you, Alex, fighting this for decades.
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  Sometimes I think you must just want to go to Costa Rica
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  and take a vacation, take a break.
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  But we're past that point right now.
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  Everything we do every day is for our posterity.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  And it's for those that don't have the,
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  it is very sorrowful to me that as an American,
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  I have more to do with the security and safety
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  of Christians in Syria and Iraq
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  than they have to provide for their own security and safety
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  because our State Department goes traipsing around the world,
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  class and havoc and war, promising the world to...
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  And that's all done because these globalists
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  never are held accountable.
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  So they can just sit back and play God
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  while we all kill each other.
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  How do we get such a satanic ruling elite in the West?
[2:53:46.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  How do they live with themselves?
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  I sit there and measure how many people do we help?
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  How can we have helped more?
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  How can I fail to get this person out of the country
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  before they were captured?
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  And it addles me.
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  And I have trouble sleeping.
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  If I was the Secretary of State,
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  how does this man go to bed?
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  They don't have conscience.
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  It's very pathetic.
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  It's very sorrowful.
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  God forbid they do have a conscience.
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  God forbid that Brookings Institute bragging about
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  we're going to lure Russia into a 10-year war.
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  But now we know what happens in wars.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  They're sending young women, young orphans,
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  let out of orphanages, put on trains sent west
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  where Chechen gangs are waiting for them.
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  They're picked up in their traffic.
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  You want 10 years of that.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  You want 10 years of that.
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  We have children that are wandering out west.
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  There were orphans.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  And they have Asperger's or Down syndrome.
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  And we're finding them or bringing them to our shelters.
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  This is something I didn't think about.
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  What happens with kids with autism
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  that are in government facilities when that city is shattered
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  and people are just shoved on trains
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  and they're milling around Lviv.
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  And then class qualms bragging,
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  we're going to collapse society.
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  This is it, folks.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  What happens to the 14-year-old orphan girl,
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  the child with Down syndrome that was in a government facility
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  or with Asperger for autism?
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  They get thrown off the side.
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  They're wandering, confused, lost.
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  I remember once doing a homeless mission in L.A.
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  and there was a young woman who was from Darfur,
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  maybe in her 30s.
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  This was right after the genocide where I had been working.
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  And I thought, how do I run into a woman from Darfur?
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  She wandered around L.A. just shattered.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  A woman from Sudan, war shattered her.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  War is nothing noble.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  War is nothing beautiful.
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  War is sorrowful and war is tragic.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  At least if you were a soldier, I'm a soldier.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  My son fought in Iraq in Syria.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  My dad was a soldier.
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  My brother fought in Iraq.
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  We're a family of soldiers.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  You know, there is a nobility to stand and defend your country
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  and defend the vulnerable.
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  There is no nobility to cheer on a war
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  that you will never fight in,
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  that you have no skin in the game in,
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  and people are dying.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  But that's the good news is
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  94% of Americans in the big national poll
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  know Biden's behind the inflation and not Russia.
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  And upwards of 80% and a bunch of polls are against this war.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  So Americans are rejecting this.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  Yeah.
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  And then the messing it up with the,
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  everyone knows Twitter lies now, Facebook lies now.
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  Do you know on Facebook,
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  I cannot boost an article from the economist on the Uighur.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  If the word Uighur is in it,
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  I cannot pay to boost it on Facebook.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  Imagine being Facebook and defending China and death camps.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  Like what?
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  When I was arrested,
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  we would go to NBA games, these big banners that said
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  free the Uighur with the primary exile.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  And one of the security guards said,
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  you can have any sign you want,
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  but just you can't bring signs that say
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  have Hong Kong or Uighur on it.
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  So the NBA is protecting China.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  You know, Walt Disney is slamming Florida,
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  but they made a movie Mulan in Xinjiang,
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  East Turkistan that made the Uighur the villains
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  and the Han Chinese, the heroes slaughtering the Uighur.
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  They shot the movie in Xinjiang
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  in eyesight of concentration camps
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  and Disney partnered with, that made this movie.
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  Disney's incredibly evil.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  All right, Jason Jones,
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  how do folks find your great work?
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  Well, my website is TheGreatCampaign.org.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  That's our work to stand with the vulnerable
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  and advance the interest of the vulnerable.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  MovieToMovement.com, all of my movies,
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  and Jason Jones' show on Gitter.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  All right, come back sooner and be safe.
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  You plan to leave again?
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  Yeah, I have to go back to Poland and Ukraine
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  in about 10 days.
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  All right, can you come on via Skype from there?
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  Yeah, I would love to do that.
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  You picked the time.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  You tell the producers, Scott or Dario,
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  let's get you on, brother.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  Yes, sir, thank you.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  Really appreciate you, love you.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  God bless you, love you.
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  Great job, your courage.
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  All right, coming up, J. Dyer straight ahead.
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  I've got a few final things I'm gonna add.
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  Then J. Dyer takes over.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  Infowars.com.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  Tomorrow's news today on Filtered and Real.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:49.000]  Over the years,
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  Infowars has produced more than 200
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  amazing Patriot Americana
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:57.000]  Second Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts,
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:57:59.000]  ball caps, flags,
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  you name it.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:04.000]  at cost right now.
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  That's just regular plain chain shirts.
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  That is all sorts of designer shirts.
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  Shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:14.000]  We used to sell for $40.
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:16.000]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  Whatever the shirt costs us,
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  if a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  for essentially produce.
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves,
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:27.000]  and we've got short sleeves.
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:29.000]  We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all.
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:30.000]  And they're limited edition,
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  because we're never gonna make any of these designs.
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:37.000]  that will be limited,
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  limited edition in the future.
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air,
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  plus it spreads the word.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:44.000]  InfowarsStore.com.
[2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  Hear historic apparel now.
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  InfowarsStore.com.
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:58:49.000 --> 2:58:53.000]  InfowarsStore.com is offering the biggest sales
[2:58:53.000 --> 2:58:56.000]  in its over 20 year history.
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:58:59.000]  And that is because the economy is breaking down,
[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  inflation is exploding,
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:02.000]  the supply chains have broken down,
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:05.000]  and Infowars is having serious trouble
[2:59:05.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  making its payroll and paying for operations.
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  And I do not want to implode or downsize
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:13.000]  in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:15.000]  Infowars, it's paradoxical.
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:16.000]  It's more popular than ever.
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:18.000]  It's reaching more people than ever,
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:19.000]  despite the censorship.
[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  But because of cost increasing
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  and having to run our own infrastructure
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:25.000]  and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else,
[2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  we are running out of money.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  So listen up to 75% off at InfowarsStore.com
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:33.000]  on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts
[2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  that help spread the word and fund the operation.
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:39.000]  On supplements, on books, on films,
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:41.000]  everything is 25 to 75% off.
[2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  Right now, the biggest sell in our history
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:45.000]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:59:45.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  Thank you for your support.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:20.000]  All right, Jay Donner and Team Honest.
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  Five minutes is about to take over.
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  And I am extremely thankful to all the viewers
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  and all the listeners,
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  and I just want you to understand
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:32.000]  that we have done so together,
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  and the fight has now really reached the peak
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  of conflict here.
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  So now more than ever,
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  your word of mouth about the broadcast,
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  your prayers for the show and myself,
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  and the great intervention of God
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  that I witnessed in my life,
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  it's just so essential,
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  and I'm so humbled by that,
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  and I thank you all.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  But I do ask for your prayers,
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  and I do ask for your word of mouth,
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  and I do ask for your financial support.
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  So we have some cost overrides here.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  We have some problems funding the operation,
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  and I don't want to lay people off,
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  so I start doing a bunch of accounting,
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  and they go,
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  we've told you 100 times,
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  you design t-shirts all the time,
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  and then you don't promote most of them,
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  so we have 60,000 t-shirts.
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  Well, they're down to 40,000.
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  In the last two weeks, great job, listeners.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  We got to sell the rest of those 40,000.
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  We're never going to remake them again.
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  They're limited edition.
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  Some are amazing.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  Some are okay.
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  The point is, they're my designs,
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  over 100 of them.
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:32.000]  But then I walk in this morning and go,
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  what are all these new t-shirts?
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  They go, well, you decided to get rid
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  of the t-shirts two weeks ago.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  We've got four more designs coming in
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  before this is over.
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  Remember this one?
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  Alex Jones is right.
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  The big red Thunderbolt.
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  Alex Jones is right.
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  It's a beautiful shirt.
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  Infowars.com in the back.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  And I thought, oh, yeah,
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  that's the one I was going to order
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  for a fundraiser to stay on air.
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  They go, exactly.
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  So all the other shirts,
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  including the new ones that just came in,
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  their Let's Go brand new shirts, you name it,
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  three new designs came in this week,
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  they are all at cost.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  So the shirt costs us $5, it's $5,
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  it costs us $10, it's $10.
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  This shirt costs us,
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  costs us like $8.
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  It's got good printing and a nice fabric.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  But it is being sold with a markup
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  to Funding Operation as a fundraiser,

[3:05:57.000 --> 3:06:03.000]  MUSIC
[3:06:03.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  Welcome back to the Allys Jones Show.
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:09.000]  Today, I'm going to be covering a text that is overlooked.
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:12.000]  It's one of the more important global elite texts.
[3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:16.000]  It's one of those inter-core texts that was circulated
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:19.000]  amongst the Royal Society, amongst the scientific,
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  literary elite of the British Empire.
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  And that's the book, Ghost in the Machine, by Arthur Kessler.
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  I read and lectured through this book many years ago,
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  and I couldn't believe what I actually found in this book.
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  It's pretty well known, again, as I said, amongst those academic
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:36.000]  and scholarly and royal society elite,
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  but I would say outside of the circle of those academic scholarly circles,
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  it's not very well known.
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  But this book has had clearly a very important impact,
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  and we're going to notice the continuity, once again,
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  of the agenda going all the way back to the Malthusians,
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  to the Darwin's, to the Galtons, to the Wedgewoods, the Huxleys.
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  We're going to see that consistent pattern working all the way up through
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  the very important writings of Arthur Kessler
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  in his 1967 book, The Ghost in the Machine.
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:10.000]  He begins by saying that we all know now that evolution is a dogma.
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  Evolution is something that can't be questioned,
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  and he says, what I'm going to do in this book
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  is I'm going to take the insights of evolutionary philosophy and psychology,
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:25.000]  and I'm going to combine it with J.B. Watson's behaviorism and materialism.
[3:07:25.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  He says we know that, in principle, there is no soul,
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:32.000]  there is no psyche that we can identify in our microscope.
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:38.000]  But he says there are things that could potentially point to higher level realities.
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:40.000]  So he's not completely a behaviorist materialist.
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  In fact, he says that, no, there's actually a deeper force at work behind nature
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  that isn't strictly speaking physical.
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  He does mention that the Rockefellers and the BF Skinner operant conditioning
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:58.000]  was very important to discoveries made in the behaviorist disciplines.
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:02.000]  But he says that we can't reduce everything to the physical.
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  And so he says that I ended up working closely with Harvard and Yale individuals,
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:12.000]  this sort of CIA Eastern Coast Seaboard Elite Nexus.
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:18.000]  And he says that together we were able to work towards solving human psychology
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  and human modus operandi.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:24.000]  This was all part of the conquering of the inner domain of man
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  after they believe they had conquered the exterior domain.
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  So now the mind is the last sort of frontier to be conquered.
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  He goes on to say that using rat studies, for example,
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  you probably, you may have heard of the, I'm trying not to sneeze.
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  You may have heard of the, I got this old book out so like all the dust is in my face now.
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  But you may have heard of the recent rat studies called the beautiful ones, right?
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:55.000]  Where people looked at how society would reorganize around pampered
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:08:58.000]  and sort of exalted e-celebrity rats
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  and how they would become the sort of the Instagram rat stars of their rat maze.
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  He talks about the same type of stuff back in the 60s.
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  And he says that rat studies showed us how to analyze and control human societies.
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  And he says that there's a problem in rank materialism.
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  That rank materialism doesn't satisfy, you know, people's inner desires.
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  It leaves people sort of empty and nihilistic.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:29.000]  It doesn't answer a lot of the questions about the forces in nature that go beyond just merely the physical.
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  So he says that we got to come up with some other kind of philosophy or worldview to explain beyond the material.
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  Now, he is not in any sense a theist or a Christian, so don't misunderstand me.
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  In fact, he says that the imminent force within nature is what a lot of religions and people have called God,
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  but it's not some sort of personal God.
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  It's just a kind of pantheistic nature and process.
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:02.000]  So according to Kessler, it's not God or any kind of theism or deity.
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  It's just the natural universe itself in process is God.
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  And that is pantheism in terms of theology.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  So it's a return in a way to ancient pagan philosophies.
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  And you could see analogues to this in today's society with people like Richard Dawkins, right?
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  Richard Dawkins says, I'm not a theist.
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  He says, and I don't know if there's a God, but if there is, it would be something like aliens and or pantheism.
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  The universe is God.
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  What's the problem with the idea of saying the universe is God?
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  Well, as Kessler moves to this book, he goes on to talk about nature itself, again, having organizing principles.
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  Now, you're going to see a really nefarious bait and switch that Kessler will do with the notion of reality
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  or the external world or nature being a self-organizing principle.
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  Again, it's not a God who organizes nature within divine provenance or that there's some purpose in it.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:05.000]  It's a reality that's an impersonal force, something like the force of Star Wars, right, that organizes itself on its own.
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  So it would be like chaos, somehow giving chaos, intention, meaning, and purpose or telos in philosophy.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:20.000]  So in other words, I'm just pointing out that that doesn't actually make sense, but watch what he will do
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  when he applies his notion of holistic organisms and nature to understanding individuals,
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  because you can start to see that this is going to be an attack on a certain type of view of man and individuals
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  to argue that you are against nature if you don't join the collective.
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  That's the route you're going to see with where he takes this.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:46.000]  By the way, that's the exact same thing that Salk does in his books.
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  Like Salk says that, Jonas Salk says that we have been under this mistaken idea since the Enlightenment
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:58.000]  that there are individuals. There are no individuals. You are just merely one organism in the collective.
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  You are one molecule right now in this gigantic thing that works together as a whole.
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  And apart from the whole, you don't have any meaning or existence.
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  And in fact, you are a cancer on the collective.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:17.000]  And just like Salk, he's going to argue that we're going to have to get away from this idea.
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  He says we're going to have to get away from the idea that there are individuals.
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:25.000]  And we're going to have to introduce to everybody that they must be part of the collective.
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  Now, one of his compatriots, Aldous Huxley, wrote a book called The Perennial Philosophy
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  where he argued that there will be a religion in the future and it will have a reaching for a grasping for something beyond the material.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  So they never intended, I don't think, amongst these people to leave everyone in a rank materialist view of the world, right?
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:53.000]  That all that exists has mattered, right? I'm not talking about going shopping and buying a bunch of Gucci bags.
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  That's not what I mean by materialism. I'm talking about the philosophical view that all that exists is physical solid matter, right?
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  That's what materialism is. And that's the view that comes out of a lot of the atheist enlightenment philosophers,
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  really comes to the forefront in Victorian England.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  And a lot of the Royal Society people that really promote the worldview of scientism, Bertrand Russell, for example, right,
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:22.000]  in the same circles as Kessler, they also promote this idea of rank materialism.
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  And you can see that at the same time of the 60s, 70s, right around the time, interesting, of the counterculture revolution that these people fostered
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  and get this, Kessler himself, back in 1960, before any of the, you know, hate Ashbury, Laurel Canyon people in the so-called counterculture had been doing this,
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  he was doing hallucinogen, psilocybin, and so forth, with Timothy Leary and with other people at Harvard.
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  So he was tripping balls at the same time as Leary was before everybody else.
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  And what he started to realize was that there's more to reality than just the physical.
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  And this is a pretty common phenomenon amongst people who take hallucinogens and have had trips.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  I've known that in the past as well, in my younger days.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  And it does tend to sort of give people the potentiality for breaking out of the worldview of rank materialism.
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  I'm not advocating, I'm not saying people should do that, I'm saying that that does happen at times when people take these substances.
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  And I don't know for a fact that happened with Kessler, but after 1960 when he had had these LSD experiences or these psilocybin experiences,
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  he did go on to later write this book and say, hey, there does appear to be a life force and an imminent power beyond the material that is moving and sort of causing the flow of the universe of the natural world.
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  And it does seem to direct things towards some purpose or individual purposes based on those systems within nature.
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  So he says, let's call these systems in nature holons.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  And for him, that is little organisms that work together for a common goal.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:03.000]  Now, I'm not necessarily disagreeing with this idea.
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:11.000]  I think clearly you can see, you know, plants and trees and different things in nature, various bugs, organisms, they do operate in this way, right?
[3:15:11.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  Ants and ant colonies, right?
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:17.000]  They all work together as a common purpose within the ant colony.
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:19.000]  Bees do this, right? The queen bee.
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  So this is well known.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  I'm not taking the issue with that, but watch what he's going to do to adopt that and say, you see, nature tells us that we cannot be individuals.
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  We must only be collectivists.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  We must all submit to the collective.
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  And that is precisely what Huxley said in his perennial philosophy.
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  These are the religions of the future will be basically, you must be absorbed into the universal blob.
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  Have you seen the blob, the old fifties one and the eighties one, which is fun as well.
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  Let's get into the blob when we get back.
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:16:10.000]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other, who are literally trying to create a post human world.
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  For the United States of Brazil, and of course, triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:20.000]  That's why they launched their great reset.
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:25.000]  And they're program after collapsing us of build back better.
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:31.000]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:39.000]  Because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system could win.
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:42.000]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  It's that simple. They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:54.000]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  Expose this paradigm and we win.

[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.000 --> 3:20:20.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. We were looking at the important influential text by Arthur Kessler, the ghost in the machine.
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  And you can begin to see what he's talking about there with the machine referring to nature or the human body itself and then the ghost being the soul, the mind, the spirit, the life force, whatever might be on the physical machinery of the meat sack of the body.
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:42.000]  And in 1967, Kessler had, as I said, had been working on this, published this.
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:55.000]  And then he also at the same time had written about his experiences with the drug culture with psilocybin and referred in cases to Huxley's Doors of Perception.
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  So we know that, again, even amongst the Royal Society type elites, there was this familiarity very early on, very far ahead of the 60s counterculture revolution with hallucinogens and with, you know, breaking on through to the other side as Jim Morrison talked about.
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  And many of these guys had done that, right? They had had these experiences and then applied them back then to their worldview.
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  And I'm making that point because over and over and over, we see that this very important connection between the hardcore hallucinogens and the attitudes and views of the people in these circles, especially the MKL,
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:47.000]  the doctors who helped, of course, promote and create LSD and the big pharma corporations that helped them synthesize it and put it out on a mass scale. And what you can see is that these people, including Bertrand Russell, I don't know if Bertrand Russell was doing LSD, but he did talk about free love, right?
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  So back decades before the 60s counterculture revolution, people in the Royal Society like Kessler, like Huxley had talked about the potential effect of releasing these things in the public and the social reorientation and re-engineering that these things could have.
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:17.000]  And I say that just to point out that they were aware of what they were doing. This wasn't an accidental thing. They knew that it would have these effects and they at least wanted to study them in regard to what elements they didn't know.
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  What would this actually do to society when we let these things loose? And they had seen in their own lives the effects of how hallucinogens had changed their attitude towards reality, how Huxley wrote about this in various texts that he did.
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  And it's odd too because at times many of these people, whether it's John C. Lilly or whether it's Huxley, they would at times talk about it like it's demonic, that when they would have these experiences, they even seem to be aware that the entities and things that they would interact with were in many cases demonic.
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:23:11.000]  They were intensely evil beings of hatred that wanted to destroy and deceive humanity and they always have the same message. Now, I'm not saying everybody has a bad trip, but in fact, in Kessler's case, he actually did have a bad trip, but I'm not saying everybody has a bad trip.
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:30.000]  I understand that, but the message curiously is always the same. Why is that? Why don't we get some, you know, clockwork elves or DMT beings that, I don't know, tell you to be nice and humble and to marry and have a bunch of kids.
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:44.000]  The clockwork elves never say that, ever. Right. What do they say? Oh, we love you. We want to kill you. The only way to save your planet is if everybody creates a world government and kills everybody, then we'll love you and you'll be safe.
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  That's what they always say. They'll watch on YouTube countless people's DMT trip reports. They all say the same. Why? Why would they all report the same thing?
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  The DMT elves told me that we need to work together, create a world religion and a world government and if we kill everybody, then the aliens will let us live.
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  That's always what they say. And it's no different than what they told these people back at this time. And they even said, well, yeah, I'm interacting with entities and they seem to be demonic, but I guess we better do what they say.
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  Right. Especially in the case of John C. Lilly, right? I mean, he explicitly even says, sometimes when I would have these deep trips, I felt like I was interacting with Lucifer or, you know, extremely demonic beings.
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  But hey, I guess that's what we need to do. That's the power in the universe. That's there, the imminent force within the universe.
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  And I have to mention, because I just finished these two books, if you don't know C. S. Lewis, who, you know, famous Christian apologist and writer, I'm sure everybody's heard of the Narnia series.
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:25:07.000]  A lot of people don't know he has a separate series that was less famous called the Space Trilogy. And in the Space Trilogy, he wrote, again, very prophetic, way ahead of its time, about the alien deception.
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  Right. So in that Christian dystopia, and to my knowledge, that's the only Christian dystopia that I'm even aware of, he talks about how there would be this kind of alien deception.
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  He even calls out the global depopulation eugenics agenda, especially in part three, where you have what's basically, for all intents and purposes, the Illuminati.
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  It doesn't call it that. It's called some acronym. It's called, like, NICE, N-I-C-E, but it's supposed to be the Scientific Humanitarian Organization that has a front of helping the world.
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  But secretly in the inner core, they have made a deal with the demonic offworld entities, aka demons, they're calling aliens, to radically depopulate the planet.
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:59.000]  So C.S. Lewis predicted everything that we're seeing nowadays long ago. Now, how and why did he do that?
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  Well, he was in the circles of people at Oxford and Cambridge, like Bertrand Russell, like the Kesslers, like the people in the Royal Society that I'm talking about.
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:18.000]  Charles Galton, these people. So he knew what they were up to. And he probably didn't feel like he could just outright write about it because people would say he's crazy or whatever.
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  So he put it into fiction. And this is a classic method that we've seen many British fiction writers do.
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:32.000]  Excuse me, my mouth is really dry in here. It's allergies. It's allergies. It's not cocaine, it's like, he's doing drugs, he's always sniffing and sniffing.
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  No, it's allergies, dude. I have allergies. So C.S. Lewis is trying to describe the reality of what the Royal Society and the Malthusian depopulation agenda is up to,
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:54.000]  especially in part three, by pointing out that it is fundamentally demonic. Now, in part two of that series, Parallondra, the main character who basically represents Tolkien,
[3:26:54.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  is taken to a planet Venus, and there he interacts with different entities, one of whom is a demonically possessed professor.
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:11.000]  And the demonically possessed professor, I mean, he's explicitly called that in the text, has the very worldview that Kessler is talking about.
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:18.000]  And he believes that he is an enlightened being that will bring spirituality to the world.
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:28.000]  He's going to rescue the world from rank materialism and bring it a kind of monistic, raw one spirituality.
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  And it just amazed me that not only is that found in popular sort of pseudo-new ageers of the time, like Tehard de Chardin, or Arthur Kessler,
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  or Bertrand Russell, I mean, Russell's the rank materialist, so he would apply to the professor in volume one of that series.
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:59.000]  But by volume two of the series, the professor, who's the atheist materialist, is actually demonically possessed, and now believes in a global, monistic,
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  Luciferian kind of religion. Man is an emergent, evolving God, and so Lewis is actually eventually talking about transhumanism in those novels,
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:12.000]  again, way ahead of his time, super prophetic. And by the way, I just lectured through this on my YouTube channel,
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  if you want to go see the lectures analyzing these books.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  It's exactly what is in Kessler. Kessler is saying that the religion of the future, the perennial religion, will be this religion of the worship of nature.
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  And we're going to see why that matters in a moment. Things like the UN biological diversity assessment that Alex has talked about for so long.
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  Guess what Kessler says? Kessler is going to say that in the process of human evolution, things like cannibalism and human sacrifice were necessary things.
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  They themselves prompted a kickstarted, booted evolution, he says, towards the end of this book.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:29:17.000]  Now, can you imagine where that's going to go? Don't go anywhere. This is the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, of Jay's & Else's.

[3:31:49.000 --> 3:31:56.000]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action. Take action now, infowarstore.com.
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:32:05.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars. I've been on the air a couple of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[3:32:05.000 --> 3:32:10.000]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalists.
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:18.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed, the first one, mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:27.000]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling. We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[3:32:27.000 --> 3:32:34.000]  We're selling everything out to fund the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:40.000]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs. So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[3:32:40.000 --> 3:32:56.000]  And I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com. Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[3:33:11.000 --> 3:33:15.000]  Welcome back to the Ox Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer from Jay's Analysis.
[3:33:15.000 --> 3:33:32.000]  We were talking about Arthur Kessler's philosophy, the similarity in Kessler's nature worship and kind of a proto-new age attitude to explaining nature and sort of giving man a new approach to understanding reality.
[3:33:32.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  And I mentioned that he says that in nature, you find systems, tree and root systems, cave systems and bees and the way bees work in terms of beehives, the way Nicholas Cage fights the bees in Wicker Man.
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  And he says that if you think about it, nature then is a kind of, he even describes it as a pyramid. He says it's pyramidal in the sense that the way the systems work is that they function on programs programmed in the nature at a base level.
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:09.000]  And then there's a level above that. There's a level of that. And then, you know, the queen bee at the top of the beehive, right?
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  And so he gives these examples of stuff, right? So he'll give these examples and all these diagrams helping to explain.
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:27.000]  And while that might be true and part of, he's doing a systems analysis of nature, the problem is that he's doing it for the purpose of twisting it into a propaganda to say, well, look.
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  So in our view, the problem is we can get an insight from far eastern philosophy. The problem is duality and distinction and having many different things.
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  Having distinctions means that that's the problem and thus the distinctions have to be destroyed and then we can merge everybody into the blob.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  Have you seen the blob, right? The blob is this. And I think at the time when the blob came out, kind of like invasion of the body snatchers, that was part of a strategy of the Cold War, right before the Cold War, right when it was starting to kind of
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:11.000]  give the impression through literature and through propaganda that anything that's collective is part of the communist Soviet thing and we should oppose that.
[3:35:11.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  Now, I'm not saying that one of the sides of this are necessarily better, right? It's not like having a bunch of things is necessarily better than having one blob.
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  Or because I think that reality is one and many. There's both of these principles in nature and they don't have to cancel one another out. We don't have to destroy families and individuals and nations to have the global government.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  But the operating system of the global elites is that you have to destroy, like a wrecking ball, blend everything into the blob tower of Babel.
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:54.000]  That's the whole point of the book, basically, is how are we going to blend everything into a blob so that we can reintegrate man into actual order.
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  So the argument is that man is the problem. Man has to be broken down, he says, and reassembled.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  Notice the whole chapter that he mentions here, the next chapter here is individuals and individuals, right?
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:28.000]  So he's saying that the very idea of there being such a thing as an individual has to be destroyed. You destroy it by breaking everything down and then reintegrating it and synthesizing it back into the blob.
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  And that's also what Huxley said. So we know that this is the philosophy of the operating system of the elite.
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:41.000]  And he said, well, but that sounds like communism. Well, it is partly. It's not totally communism.
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  For one, Kessler himself was a rabid communist, right? No surprise there.
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:58.000]  But what did he do that he remained in Hungary? I think it was Hungarian, right? Did he remain? No, he expatriated to the West when he got tired of communism.
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  Now, does that mean that he gave up communism? No, no, he just reoriented it to the Royal Society vision, which is above the communist capitalist dialectic.
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  In fact, the Royal Society was the early proponent of the third way of the synthesis of capitalism and communism to promote what would be the proto-world government philosophy that we're going into today, right?
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:33.000]  So the third way idea goes back to what Quigley talked about, goes back to ideas coming out of these NGOs and think tanks at the time of during the Cold War.
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  And you even had in the CFR back at the time, I believe Alger Hiss and others were actually arguing within the CFR meetings that why don't we just go ahead and have a third way synthesis instead of having a Cold War?
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  Let's just blend the East and the West into a combination of capitalism, communism, socialism and fascism all at once.
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  And this is what people can't understand. They can't grasp what's going on because they're still operating.
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:09.000]  Most people, right, even sophisticated professor type people, they think we're still living in a world that has democratic capitalism, communism, socialism, fascism.
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  Those are all 20th century ideologies that are pretty much dead, that they're not really relevant anymore because democratic capitalism won the Cold War and now is morphing into something else.
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  It's not morphing organically though, it's morphing into a third way type of system that these people talked about and planned a long time ago in many, many books.
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  And what this book represents is not anything, it's not a geopolitical strategy book, it's a scientific social engineering book about how to break everybody down,
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  solve a coagulate, dissolve and then re coagulate into the new system, the new form, phoenix from the ashes.
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  It's all expressing the same idea through covert scientific means.
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:05.000]  That's what this book is about. The covert scientific means are about directing and controlling the machine.
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  How do we step back in as the priests of nature, the scientific priest class to commandeer evolution and to reboot it and kickstart it in the direction of advancing the species and transcending man becoming gods, literally.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  Well, he starts by talking about the potentialities of genetic engineering, mastering DNA and not just mastering DNA, but manipulating DNA.
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  So the manipulation of DNA, he thinks that this time again he's writing in the mid 60s here, has the potentiality to completely renovate, completely alter the way that we view man and nature and then we can not just convince man of dangerous and aberrant worldviews to stunt him.
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  We can actually utilize scientific technique and process to manipulate RNA and DNA and to stunt man intentionally by toxic things in the environment.
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  By, according to Salk, again, people in the same circles as him, by inoculations, that's what survival of the wisest by Jonah Salk says. So now how can we use vaccines to experiment on people and get the population down?
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  That's the whole point of it. So nothing about saving people from, you know, debilitating diseases.
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  That's the cover for what Salk was really up to. And he wrote two books about it, but he's a hero for some reason.
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  Well, I guess he's a hero because he's one of the great deceivers who gave the impression that he's saving everybody from polio when really his two books describe how to kill everybody with vaccines and use them as experiments.
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  It's amazing to me that he wrote two books on this and they're they're public. You can go read them. You know, he's a hero. He saved people. He saved. Oh, yeah, just like Klaus Schwab is saving people, right? It's just like just like mRNA genetic experiment vaccines, quote unquote, which are not vaccines. They're saving people, right?
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  So Kessler goes on to talk about man is a system within the systems. We got to figure out how to get man out of thinking that he stands apart from above or separate or distinct from the system of nature.
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  And anytime you get into the green agenda stuff, anytime you get into the biological diversity assessment stuff, you'll notice that they do the exact same thing.
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:41.000]  It's all the same plan, all the same approach. Humans have thought that they were unique. They thought that they were made in the image of God. Humans thought that they had a special role.
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  You know, you're no different than any other creature in the natural order. And the very thought that you're distinct is part of the problem.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  Now, notice that's actually a contradiction to what Kessler says in the very book later on when he says that when humans were evolving out of monkey stage and they were Geico cavemen running around,
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  literally he says that when they began to do things like cannibalism and human sacrifice, he says this was a giant leap in their evolutionary development.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  But now wait a minute, I thought we're bad for existing and trying to improve and to progress. So are we bad for existing and progressing?
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  Or is cannibalism and whatnot good because it jump starts, it jump kicks, jump starts our evolutionary development.
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  And you'll notice when you read these people, I mean, they contradict themselves all the time, right? Because not only do they believe the delusions and the errors that they're saying, they also are illogical.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:55.000]  They also don't even recognize when they contradict at such a fundamental level like that. They don't go anywhere. This is Alex Jones, your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:43:04.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse. I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:14.000]  And I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist. And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed, Gun Control Works,
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:20.000]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew. That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it. We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory.
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:39.000]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future. They'll just be limited editions and short runs. So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  And what I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com. Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:44:09.000]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here, all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases, actually,
[3:44:09.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:35.000]  This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:48.000]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com. Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.

[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:38.000]  They cost $10, we're selling them for $10. And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves. We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all.
[3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:48.000]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs. Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:46:11.000]  We've got to sell this to keep infowars on the air, plus it spreads the word, infowarstore.com, your historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.

[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:32.000]  I'd like to go to the infowarstore and get those products. I bought many of the products over the years. I've been happy with everyone that I bought, whether it's the materials or whether it's the products for brushing one's teeth.
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:50.000]  I highly recommend the Coral Calcium. There's an important point towards the end of this book that I want to get to in terms of Arthur Kessler's analysis where he says that in the future when we bring in this new order and eventually the book moves towards the bringing in the technocracy very explicitly.
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  He says that we're going to have to utilize certain things that we've seen in past examples like the French Revolution's new calendar.
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  So being himself formerly a communist, right? He knew about the history of Marxism, communism and French Revolutionaries who had instituted this idea of year zero where they came with their own calendar and they want to replace all of the existing calendar because of structure around things like religious holidays, right?
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:27.000]  So that has to be gotten rid of, he says. And he says that one thing we could do is come up with this idea of year zero. He says that when the nuclear bomb and the nuclear threat came about, now we're at year zero.
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:35.000]  He says now man has progressed to a point where we are in danger and crisis and the whole world will be destroyed by nukes, bombs.
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  And we see this in a lot of these people in these circles where Russell did this, H.G. Wells does this. They on the one hand will say we are so genius because we invented nuke bombs, a bombs.
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:57.000]  Oh, by the way, you are at fault because man has invented these bombs. And man's guilty for inventing the things that supposedly could destroy the planet, but also where the genius has invented them and you deserve it.
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:49:12.000]  So it's like a constant gaslighting bait and switch. But here we have, as I pointed out, in every one of these global elite texts, almost every one of them, 99% of them down to the last one, maybe one I can think of that doesn't do this because it's about CIA operations.
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:21.000]  But after about 60 of these, they all say crisis, crisis, crisis, we're in a crisis, man is the crisis, right?
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:29.000]  What does the UN Biodiversity Assessment say? We're in a crisis, man is going to destroy the planet, we're all going to die.
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:43.000]  And Kessler says there's only one way out of this problem. Can you guess what his, you said, yeah, well it's depopulation, yeah it's depopulation, but what do you think is the means by which he thinks we can get to the depop?
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:55.000]  Believe it or not, it's MKUltra. So well, I thought that was about mind control. What does that have to do with, no, MKUltra is not just about mind control, it's about mastering the entire human being.
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  Body, mind, biology, everything about man is intended to be mastered, not to save man, but to control man, emasculate him, and ultimately kill him.
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  Now that's for most of the world, right? And this is the really important, if you just want to skip everything in this book and get to the meat of it, you could go to the last part where it's called the age of climax.
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:39.000]  And this is where he's saying it's the end of civilization into the world unless we enact these extreme measures of utilizing the studies and research for MKUltra.
[3:50:39.000 --> 3:50:45.000]  And I can prove that to you because he cites in a couple places towards the end of the book, Dr. Holger Haydn.
[3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  And if you look at Dr. Holger Haydn, he wrote papers back in the 60s about flipping and reversing mRNA in men and women to make men more feminine and women more masculine in the 60s.
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  He wrote about doing that. Now he didn't just write that as some crazy paper, you can go find his paper, his published paper, Dr. Holger Haydn.
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  And that he presented these things at a famous conference, I think in 1969, I put it in my book.
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  If you want to get my book, by the way, you can go to JasonAlces.com.
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:23.000]  There's signed copies of part one and part two. I think this is in part one.
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:30.000]  But he says we can use these things to mutate man.
[3:51:30.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  That's the key takeaway here. And he says we'll do it through all kinds of environmental dietary injection means.
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  So we'll toxify the environment. We'll drug the water supply.
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:49.000]  That's the key thing that was most important takeaway from this book as we're going to see here in a minute.
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  But he says we're going to have to use the research and information that we learned through MKUltra in all these years and decades.
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:52:03.000]  Apply that to the mass society. By the way, it's page 330, 331 where he gets into the human sacrifice.
[3:52:03.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  Where he says, oh, this was a great leap forward in civilization and evolution by cannibalism and human sacrifice.
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:14.000]  And then he goes on to say that mind control GMO stuff is going to be the key.
[3:52:14.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  We'll mutate man. It's all about mutating man. That's the whole last section of the book.
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:27.000]  And Dr. Holger Haydn, his source for all this had presented his papers at a 1969 mind control conference.
[3:52:27.000 --> 3:52:29.000]  That's the name of the conference.
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:35.000]  Mind control conference in San Francisco sponsored by Radio Liberty and the CIA.
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:45.000]  Yes, you heard me right. Radio Liberty and the CIA sponsoring the mind control conference in San Francisco with this dude's cohorts.
[3:52:45.000 --> 3:52:54.000]  I don't know if Kessler himself was at this, but it doesn't matter because he's basically just repeating what came out of that conference.
[3:52:54.000 --> 3:53:02.000]  Kessler does go on to say that he had attended meetings at medical centers and he says that it's probably it.
[3:53:02.000 --> 3:53:08.000]  It's probably a recurring series, right? Because I'm pretty sure if I remember correctly, it's 1969 was one of the conferences.
[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:18.000]  But he says on page 333 in 1961 at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, there was an organized symposium control of the mind.
[3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  Professor Holger Haydn of Gooseburg University presented his paper, Biochemical Aspects of Brain Activity.
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:38.000]  And then he goes on to say in that that we must figure out how to stop natural birds.
[3:53:38.000 --> 3:53:48.000]  So the papers being presented at these conferences, which by the way shows that the Dr. Day tapes are all also legitimate because it's the exact same type of thing that Dr.
[3:53:48.000 --> 3:53:54.000]  Day attended, right, headed up by Rockefeller Planned Parenthood, and they were all discussing the same materials.
[3:53:54.000 --> 3:54:12.000]  And then Holger Haydn, Dr. Haydn goes on to say that we will need to use binary weapons in the food, water, and toxic environment and medical system that all combine to damage and destroy people to reduce population.
[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  Again, that is pages 332, 3 and 4 of Goose the Machine.
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  And he goes on again to cite Dean Saunders of the San Francisco Medical School, control of the mind.
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  That's the section that discusses the binary agents.
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:34.000]  So yes, binary weapons are real.
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:36.000]  What is a binary weapon?
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:48.000]  It's when you have a covert weapon where one agent is in one part of the society, might be in the food, might be in the water, and that's combined with something in another element, the injections.
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  And it's covert so nobody knows exactly how it came about.
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:55.000]  Well, Sunday, they mysteriously died.
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:54:56.000]  I don't know how it is.
[3:54:56.000 --> 3:55:04.000]  Now, I don't know exactly what's going on in all the last few years of the Coofit and all that, but I guarantee it is something like this.
[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:06.000]  And how do I know that?
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  Because he goes on to say in the last few pages of the book, pages 336, 789 in my edition, Big Pharma will have to play a key role in this.
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:19.000]  Okay, remember Big Pharma existed at this time.
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:24.000]  He says that one thing that we could do, he calls it the first phase.
[3:55:24.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  So there's phases to this plan, even back then.
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  First phase, drug the water supply.
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  Drug the water supply.
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:34.000]  How we do that?
[3:55:34.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  We will put various chemical cocktails, pills, lithium, all sorts of different potential agents added secretly to the top water.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  Secretly to the top water.
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:55.000]  A plea to the Phantom Reader, page 337.
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:56.000]  I'm not making it up.
[3:55:56.000 --> 3:55:59.000]  I know people never believe this, even though it's in all of these texts.
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:00.000]  They refuse to believe it.
[3:56:00.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  There it is.
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  You can screenshot it, go read it for yourself.
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:06.000]  We'll have to put it in the top water.
[3:56:06.000 --> 3:56:12.000]  And then he goes on to say that if you want to understand what we're doing, think of the ancient alchemists.
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  Right now, I don't think Kessler was necessarily a wizard.
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:18.000]  I don't know that he was into anything cultic or satanic.
[3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:19.000]  He may have been.
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:20.000]  I don't know.
[3:56:20.000 --> 3:56:25.000]  But regardless, the very last page says that what we're doing is just what the alchemists did.
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  Breaking down, dissolving and dissolution, and then rebuilding.
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  He says that the large pharmaceutical corporations will be our greatest hope in bringing about this alchemical destruction and transformation of man.
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  He says that together with the research that we got from the M culture projects together with the research of people like Dr. Holder Haydn and mRNA DNA manipulation.
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:57:05.000]  By the way, you can go find papers publicly at like the main psychology website or whatever, the APA or whatever, American Psychological Association.
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:13.000]  They have papers up and assessments of Dr. Holder Haydn's papers about weaponizing dementia.
[3:57:13.000 --> 3:57:18.000]  And so he talked about how this can be, you can have a positive effect and you can also weaponize these things.
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  So he goes on to say that if we can do this, we can achieve, he says, transhumanism.
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:33.000]  He says the alchemical death of most human beings will allow the elite to jumpstart their evolutionary development and merge with the tech.
[3:57:33.000 --> 3:57:36.000]  They can achieve transhumanism, he says, and achieve immortality.
[3:57:36.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  But again, at the price of killing most of the people.
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:44.000]  Now, what is more satanic than a lie offering immortality through technology if you kill most of the planet?
[3:57:44.000 --> 3:57:45.000]  It's satanic.
[3:57:45.000 --> 3:57:48.000]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it.
[3:57:48.000 --> 3:58:02.000]  It's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti human program.
[3:58:02.000 --> 3:58:09.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
