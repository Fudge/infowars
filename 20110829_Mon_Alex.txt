[00:33.160 --> 00:41.320]  Monday 29th day August 2011 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours and in
[00:41.320 --> 00:46.600]  studio we have the one the only Mike Adams the health ranger joining us with
[00:46.600 --> 00:51.640]  some breaking news on multiple fronts one of the big stories you're gonna be
[00:51.640 --> 00:57.040]  breaking in more detail here secret vaccine industry ties and military
[00:57.040 --> 01:02.840]  involvement with Institute of Medicine that continues to whitewash the reported
[01:02.840 --> 01:09.760]  dangers and adverse reactions caused by vaccines of course it's the Pentagon
[01:09.760 --> 01:14.080]  caught testing on our own troops decade after decade including nerve-gassing
[01:14.080 --> 01:19.240]  many of them to death in different parts of project shad the Brits are involved
[01:19.240 --> 01:24.200]  as well that's coming up and Mike Adams has also got more on Rossum foods the
[01:24.200 --> 01:28.160]  SWAT team raids on dairies and businesses and how they're using a
[01:28.160 --> 01:34.280]  stop-o infiltration techniques of organizations that are public so they
[01:34.280 --> 01:37.720]  can then dress it all up like they're criminals they're basically making milk
[01:37.720 --> 01:43.000]  and eggs and tomatoes that are sold by the citizenry the equivalent of cocaine
[01:43.000 --> 01:50.960]  so that is coming up as well in the third hour with Mike Adams in studio
[01:50.960 --> 01:57.800]  there has been a fresh raft of hysteria in the European Union London
[01:57.800 --> 02:04.520]  telegraph Euro bailout in doubt as hysteria sweeps Germany also a bizarre
[02:04.520 --> 02:11.320]  article out of the New York Times by Alan B Kruger a future consumption tax
[02:11.320 --> 02:17.840]  to fix today's economy and with a straight face the writer says that a
[02:17.840 --> 02:23.480]  consumption tax of 5% basically on everything in this country would help
[02:23.480 --> 02:29.680]  the economy yes all economic science shows that taxes slow economic growth
[02:29.680 --> 02:36.800]  in commerce that's not debated but hey they say the answer is taxes and they
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.080]  have a particularly ridiculous way that they spin that Barack Obama's uncle has
[02:42.080 --> 02:48.080]  been arrested and held as an illegal immigrant his aunt has been granted
[02:48.080 --> 02:56.640]  asylum also we're going to get into obviously the fact that the hurricane
[02:56.640 --> 03:01.000]  was a bunch of hype and that the New York Times also pushed the need for
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.000]  carbon taxes paid to Al Gore because if you pay the high priest he will shake
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.680]  his magic stick and throw some powder in the fire and there'll be a big poof and
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.240]  we'll all be healed if you pay him and Lord Rothschild your money everything
[03:16.240 --> 03:20.240]  will be fine hurricane lost team as experts misjudged structure and next
[03:20.240 --> 03:26.000]  move Irene forecast on track not up to speed with wind so why the big Irene
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.680]  blow up and it goes on from there how that was hyped there's another one
[03:30.680 --> 03:34.880]  perfect storm of hype politicians the media and the hurricane Irene apocalypse
[03:34.880 --> 03:40.520]  that never was but Obama is still running around today saying be afraid be
[03:40.520 --> 03:47.680]  very afraid only FEMA can save you and thank God it wasn't worse or you know
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.200]  they'd be doing house-to-house searches for any guns they could find just like
[03:51.200 --> 03:57.800]  you saw with FEMA and Homeland Security in Katrina also I covered some of this
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.800]  yesterday but we have a in-depth article breaking it down today at mfoldwars.com
[04:01.800 --> 04:07.520]  and prismplotted.com Gore global warming skeptics for this generation's racist
[04:07.520 --> 04:12.200]  but in the video the minion he's talking to admits that his friends laugh at him
[04:12.200 --> 04:17.840]  now when he brings up man-made global warming so their hoax is in trouble so
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.600]  Gore wants to play the card that you don't like black people basically also
[04:22.600 --> 04:29.560]  Disney factory faces probe into sweatshop suicide claims and they're using
[04:29.560 --> 04:34.400]  child laborers there reportedly now why not Apple does it all these big
[04:34.400 --> 04:38.040]  companies do it and then we compete against that of course we can't compete
[04:38.040 --> 04:41.160]  against it so we've been deindustrialized just for the globalist
[04:41.160 --> 04:47.680]  want us also coming up we're gonna get into al-qaeda kingpin as new military
[04:47.680 --> 04:55.000]  commander or Tripoli it's official and a lot more on the other side of this

[08:34.600 --> 08:42.200]  metrics blasting out on the AM and FM dial as well it is Monday the 29th day
[08:42.200 --> 08:49.800]  of August 2011 can you believe that 2011 has gotten so long in the tooth before
[08:49.800 --> 08:54.760]  we know it 2012 would have come and gone and well we'll still be here
[08:54.760 --> 08:59.440]  comets wouldn't have killed us planets out of deep space wouldn't have killed
[08:59.440 --> 09:04.560]  us if we're not here it'll probably be a bio weapon that's released or nuclear
[09:04.560 --> 09:09.000]  war but I don't think that's gonna happen either in the short term but it
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.560]  always could but here we are sitting now more than two-thirds of the way into
[09:15.560 --> 09:22.440]  2011 okay I'm gonna do something I don't customarily do I'm gonna open the
[09:22.440 --> 09:26.320]  phones up or at least give the number out right here at the start of this
[09:26.320 --> 09:30.640]  worldwide transmission now I've got the news I'm gonna cover and I'd love to
[09:30.640 --> 09:33.840]  hear what you have to say about these issues I'm about to go over but we're
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.200]  gonna open the phones up and we're gonna take a lot of calls today I've
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.840]  actually been doing a better job and if you want to talk about Irene the
[09:41.840 --> 09:45.600]  hurricane that really never was and the way they're saying oh it's global warming
[09:45.600 --> 09:51.960]  pay more taxes if you want to get into Obama's uncle being arrested and held as
[09:51.960 --> 09:56.560]  an illegal immigrant if you want to get into secret vaccine industry ties and
[09:56.560 --> 10:01.880]  military involvement or if you want to get into sex offenders paid by the state
[10:01.880 --> 10:08.680]  of Chicago to babysit in government programs knowingly or if you want to
[10:08.680 --> 10:13.560]  talk about the ongoing hunt for Moammar Gaddafi and the fact that even mainstream
[10:13.560 --> 10:22.240]  media is being forced to admit that yes indeed the leader of the rebels is a
[10:22.240 --> 10:26.600]  Al Qaeda operative we told you this months ago with Webster Tarpley and
[10:26.600 --> 10:30.400]  others that came out in the LA Times Associated Press but now it is
[10:30.400 --> 10:37.680]  absolutely confirmed and the rebels are refusing to hand over the reported
[10:37.680 --> 10:43.320]  bomber of the Lockerbie Scotland aircraft now whether you think that they
[10:43.320 --> 10:49.280]  really did that or not the point is this just shows you exactly who these
[10:49.280 --> 10:54.160]  people are even though the West has asked for them to be handed back over
[10:54.160 --> 10:57.680]  because they said he's terminal cancer he's gonna die in one month giving back
[10:57.680 --> 11:02.040]  to Libya and so they did and the guys alive what two three years later but
[11:02.040 --> 11:07.720]  that just illustrates what we're facing here also I've got some other news I
[11:07.720 --> 11:13.160]  want to go over Obama invoked September 11th attacks in call for service Reuters
[11:13.160 --> 11:16.400]  reports he talked about the firefighters and police and others that
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.280]  valiantly helped on 9-11 and called for Americans to quote serve but the police
[11:21.280 --> 11:25.840]  the military the firefighters the medics who were actual victims they're not
[11:25.840 --> 11:33.960]  allowed at the 10th anniversary they're not allowed there so there he is using
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.840]  them to look like a hero himself but barring them also Mexican stage drug
[11:38.840 --> 11:42.880]  raids inside the US you heard me right the New York Times even admits this
[11:42.880 --> 11:46.720]  Kurt Nemo has an excellent article breaking it down they don't just allow
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.160]  Mexican police inside the US for raids but Mexican military commandos have
[11:51.160 --> 11:55.320]  quote discreetly traveled to the United States told you this years ago assembled
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.360]  at designated areas and dispatched helicopter missions back across the
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.960]  border aimed at suspected drug traffickers the DEA is providing logistical
[12:03.960 --> 12:08.720]  support and sharing intelligence this is part of the North American Union SPP
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.800]  deal security prosperity partnership to use Canadian Mexican troops inside the
[12:13.800 --> 12:19.360]  US for any reason including crowd control anti-terror drug raids civil
[12:19.360 --> 12:24.960]  emergencies disasters and people keep reporting on three four five years ago
[12:24.960 --> 12:29.920]  about Mexican helicopters landing burning building shooting people I've had
[12:29.920 --> 12:33.200]  sheriffs on from South Texas that have been three miles over the border and
[12:33.200 --> 12:37.280]  Mexican troops pull up on the highway and Humvees aim machine guns at them and
[12:37.280 --> 12:41.560]  say give us that marijuana or cocaine you just confiscated one case the
[12:41.560 --> 12:44.920]  sheriffs had a dump truck full of marijuana that they'd picked up on the
[12:44.920 --> 12:50.280]  US side Mexican troops came across put the guns on them and loudspeakers said
[12:50.280 --> 12:55.080]  get get away from the vehicle Mexican troops got in the vehicle drove it away
[12:55.080 --> 12:57.680]  and they go to the federal government say do something about this in the feds
[12:57.680 --> 13:04.840]  go you don't understand do you what's really going on here is that this is a
[13:04.840 --> 13:11.920]  US government big back big bank back system openly knocking out the other
[13:11.920 --> 13:15.680]  cartels that aren't laundering their money through the big Western banks
[13:15.680 --> 13:23.600]  that's what's going on here and it's all part of destroying our sovereignty
[13:23.600 --> 13:29.880]  during NLEO 9 and NLEO 10 national level exercise carried out by FEMA FEMA's own
[13:29.880 --> 13:35.360]  press release admitted intelligent services and troops from 14 different
[13:35.360 --> 13:41.040]  countries take part in quote taking on domestic terrorist here in the United
[13:41.040 --> 13:47.520]  States also burglars family awarded three hundred thousand dollars in wrongful
[13:47.520 --> 13:55.640]  death suit this is out of El Paso Texas and the family business had been robbed
[13:55.640 --> 14:03.360]  repeatedly a family business had been robbed repeatedly so the family stayed
[14:03.360 --> 14:09.040]  up late stayed in the business and when the armed admitted methamphetamine
[14:09.040 --> 14:15.720]  addicts it's all here in the article came in they shot one of them who was
[14:15.720 --> 14:24.760]  armed and the jury has ruled that I'm seeing more and more of this that they
[14:24.760 --> 14:32.680]  are civilly liable my friends there's a castle doctrine you can shoot someone if
[14:32.680 --> 14:38.360]  they come in your house and break in period day or night if it's a night
[14:38.360 --> 14:42.240]  time you can shoot somebody in your yard now it's found that you lured the man
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.240]  and it was a murder that's a different story but if it's a criminal with a
[14:46.240 --> 14:51.200]  criminal record and there's been other burglaries you're gonna get no billed
[14:51.200 --> 14:56.480]  by the grand jury even if it's in your yard and we see cases of this all over
[14:56.480 --> 15:01.320]  the country where people been robbed over and over and over again so they leave
[15:01.320 --> 15:06.040]  their garage door open which is the Texas case a few months ago and they sit
[15:06.040 --> 15:09.520]  there like they're deer hunting and when the person comes in to steal their
[15:09.520 --> 15:15.320]  bicycle again they shoot them and they kill them and when you have that type
[15:15.320 --> 15:20.680]  of activity you have much lower crime rates there's a reason Chicago New York
[15:20.680 --> 15:24.720]  and other areas have the highest crime rates in the United States because
[15:24.720 --> 15:28.760]  they're victim disarmament zones the muggings in England are off the charts
[15:28.760 --> 15:34.000]  compared to the United States the muggings are going on that's why
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.680]  muggers generally target women in the US because statistically they're not
[15:37.680 --> 15:41.760]  armed as much as men and can't fight back but more and more they're not
[15:41.760 --> 15:45.120]  mugging women because women are going out getting concealed carries or just
[15:45.120 --> 15:50.240]  carrying firearms I know my two girls will have concealed carry and they will
[15:50.240 --> 15:55.360]  carry firearms when they move out of the house and they are well the seven year
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.920]  old is already very very accurate with a rifle and a handgun and so that's the
[16:00.920 --> 16:07.720]  bottom line true feminism is to empower your girls and your boys not to teach
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.920]  them to be little helpless people but let me just cover this article first
[16:12.920 --> 16:16.480]  because it goes to the heart of everything that we're facing as a
[16:16.480 --> 16:27.360]  society this is out of the Gazette Colorado Springs burglars family awarded
[16:27.360 --> 16:32.040]  300,000 and wrongful death suit is actually El Paso County so this is in
[16:32.040 --> 16:37.880]  Colorado San El Paso Texas on Friday awarded nearly 300,000 to the daughter
[16:37.880 --> 16:42.720]  of a burglar who was fatally shot in 2009 while breaking into an auto lot
[16:42.720 --> 16:48.320]  parents of the victim Robert Johnson Fox embraced their attorneys after a
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.440]  judge announced the jury's verdict capping a two-week long civil trial in
[16:52.440 --> 16:58.680]  which business owner Jovan Milovac and his two relatives were painted as
[16:58.680 --> 17:03.680]  vigilantes who plotted a deadly ambush rather than let authorities how to cops
[17:03.680 --> 17:07.200]  have the authority to shoot somebody of their feel threatened because they've
[17:07.200 --> 17:11.280]  been given arrest powers by the citizens they've been hired by the
[17:11.280 --> 17:18.000]  incorporated city or empowered by the legislature at the county level Philip
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.560]  and Sue Fox who filed suit the wrongful death in 2010 on behalf of Fox's three
[17:23.560 --> 17:26.960]  year old daughter called the jury's award of victory and their fight to seek
[17:26.960 --> 17:30.960]  accountability for the death of their son who they say never posed a threat to
[17:30.960 --> 17:35.640]  the heavenly armed men and again they broke in through a barbed wire tall
[17:35.640 --> 17:41.360]  barbed wire fence robbers in the wrong place and doing the wrong thing but the
[17:41.360 --> 17:45.400]  punishment didn't fit the crime sue Fox said afterward ever been the victim of
[17:45.400 --> 17:49.720]  a home invasion you ever had armed people breaking in I can't excuse his
[17:49.720 --> 17:53.080]  actions but he didn't deserve to be executed well it's at night and you're

[24:40.400 --> 24:44.480]  if it's a cop and they're not in the right you have a right to defend
[24:44.480 --> 24:54.960]  yourself and it's the same thing goes for a police officer if somebody's waving
[24:54.960 --> 24:58.320]  a gun around at them they don't have to wait till you shoot them to protect
[24:58.320 --> 25:02.360]  themselves they've got the same powers a citizen has they derive their powers
[25:02.360 --> 25:08.120]  from that from the common law power that's what it all flows from and sure
[25:08.120 --> 25:14.840]  this young 20-year-old meth head out of his mind trying to break into a place
[25:14.840 --> 25:18.920]  they admit to steal the place had been robbed before that's why the family was
[25:18.920 --> 25:24.440]  there waiting I don't think the punishment fits the crime I don't think
[25:24.440 --> 25:30.000]  it's good that he is dead I'll be honest I was never a big thief but I grew up on
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.400]  a golf course and I learned from older friends how to go up to the country club
[25:34.400 --> 25:42.200]  and the golfers would have a big container a nice chest on the back of
[25:42.200 --> 25:48.200]  their golf carts full of beer and I only did it a few times mainly when older
[25:48.200 --> 25:52.720]  kids would say come on it's your turn we want some beer I'd be like 12 13 14 years
[25:52.720 --> 26:00.800]  old all right I remember I remember going to just like in caddy shack at the
[26:00.800 --> 26:05.280]  country club wasn't as fancy as the caddy shack country club but you'd have
[26:05.280 --> 26:08.040]  all the adults at the country club drinking they'd leave their drinks
[26:08.040 --> 26:12.200]  sitting there half drunk just like in caddy shack where a spalding is going
[26:12.200 --> 26:15.440]  down the bar taking a drink out of each one and then he drinks one that has a
[26:15.440 --> 26:22.080]  cigarette in it and goes out and vomits in the guy's Porsche all right I'm
[26:22.080 --> 26:28.240]  digressing back to some memory so I wouldn't want my child doing what I did
[26:28.240 --> 26:34.160]  grabbing some beer or grabbing some watermelons in fact I have some cousins
[26:34.160 --> 26:40.800]  that told the story of just for fun stealing some watermelons and they were
[26:40.800 --> 26:45.520]  running off with them and here came the shotgun pellets and they were too far
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.080]  away for it to penetrate but it sure hurt them the old timers knew how to do
[26:50.080 --> 26:53.920]  it they caught you climbing over their fence just messing with their chickens
[26:53.920 --> 26:58.080]  they'd shoot you with it you know number eight bird shot you might get a pellet
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.560]  in you or something you know they probably they caught somebody out stealing
[27:02.560 --> 27:06.160]  their tomatoes or whatever they wouldn't shoot you with a 30 odd six they
[27:06.160 --> 27:10.480]  wouldn't kill you they'd say you best start running boy as soon as you got
[27:10.480 --> 27:17.760]  about 50 yards away boom I don't come back so if but but if my place had been
[27:17.760 --> 27:22.560]  robbed repeatedly and I was there with adrenaline sitting there with a hunting
[27:22.560 --> 27:28.960]  instinct maybe for days waiting because the cops couldn't protect you or you know
[27:28.960 --> 27:32.560]  they couldn't station a cop outside their auto dealership and then here come
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.400]  the guys and you know they're taking the word of one of people that broke in
[27:36.400 --> 27:42.160]  here that well yeah we had weapons knives all taped to us but we weren't a
[27:42.160 --> 27:48.800]  threat you're on somebody's property at night with a weapon you know we've got
[27:48.800 --> 27:53.840]  to protect people's rights to live in their homes and their businesses at
[27:53.840 --> 27:59.680]  night you don't go down a badger hole at night you don't go in a bears cave you
[27:59.680 --> 28:03.520]  don't come on somebody's property you don't break in somebody's business if
[28:03.520 --> 28:07.920]  you're willing to break in somebody's business at night you're willing to do
[28:07.920 --> 28:12.880]  other crimes and that's why you're considered armed and dangerous that's
[28:12.880 --> 28:21.440]  why common law says you can be killed and it's easy to second guess people that
[28:21.440 --> 28:27.040]  kill folks that break in their houses or businesses but people that break in
[28:27.040 --> 28:32.240]  houses should know you've got a good chance of getting your hind end killed
[28:32.240 --> 28:37.360]  all right now I've already spent too much time on this but I wanted to fully
[28:37.360 --> 28:40.760]  flesh that issue out I'm gonna go to break this is a short statement come
[28:40.760 --> 28:47.960]  back to Joe Johnny Tim Tina Carlos and many others that are patiently holding

[29:14.160 --> 29:18.480]  could sit there all day I'm just joking so we're gonna be we're gonna be going

[32:16.200 --> 32:20.560]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[32:20.560 --> 32:24.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[32:24.640 --> 32:29.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[32:29.200 --> 32:33.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[34:03.040 --> 34:07.600]  denial they want to make it illegal that's been actually called for Al Gore
[34:07.600 --> 34:12.440]  plays the race card but he's the real racist very important article by Paul
[34:12.440 --> 34:18.080]  Joseph Watson pointing out that the carbon taxes alone the Copenhagen Treaty
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.320]  writers admitted would kill at least a billion people in the next decade of
[34:22.320 --> 34:27.600]  implemented because most folks are on $2 a day or less worldwide more than half
[34:27.600 --> 34:31.640]  that money goes to food you increase the energy prices that go into the food it
[34:31.640 --> 34:36.280]  will be a death sentence not to mention the biofuels that he spearheaded he's
[34:36.280 --> 34:40.840]  now had to admit that his biofuels after he got caught have killed millions and
[34:40.840 --> 34:45.200]  he's been the big guy pushing those one thing to put your waist into biofuels
[34:45.200 --> 34:51.480]  but to have most of our corn crop in this country going into biofuels not
[34:51.480 --> 34:56.760]  even corn syrup certainly a death sentence also Disney factory faces probe
[34:56.760 --> 35:01.280]  into sweatshop suicide claims human rights campaigners say Chinese factories
[35:01.280 --> 35:07.720]  are using children as young as 14 we're talking about 120 hours of overtime per
[35:07.720 --> 35:15.680]  period standing for 12 hours non-stop and having to huff the deadly gases that's
[35:15.680 --> 35:21.040]  the big thing is that man I worked in a print shop for three months a buddy got
[35:21.040 --> 35:24.920]  me a job and I thought well this is 12 bucks an hour this is better than 8 bucks
[35:24.920 --> 35:28.720]  an hour working at a golf course or something go into college and they said
[35:28.720 --> 35:34.080]  okay you're on the shrink wrapper and I was high as a kite every day but by
[35:34.080 --> 35:39.160]  lunch a few times I even went and threw up in the bathroom and after about a
[35:39.160 --> 35:43.000]  month I said I'm gonna have to quit I can't run that shrink wrapper I said I
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.480]  don't care if there's a fan over there it's not working this big industrial
[35:46.480 --> 35:51.400]  shrink wrapper back in the back of the building and I said I'll do anything else
[35:51.400 --> 35:56.120]  they said fine you'll be the one that unloads the pallets and everything then
[35:56.120 --> 35:59.640]  they put me back on the shrink wrapper and I said I just can't do this I mean
[35:59.640 --> 36:05.160]  can you imagine working in these factories where there's no environmental
[36:05.160 --> 36:10.520]  standards no nothing again that's what the globalist want to put more more
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.560]  regulations on us because then it moves everything to China which they own
[36:15.560 --> 36:20.240]  increasing their profits they put regulations on Western companies to make
[36:20.240 --> 36:23.480]  it impossible to operate then they make you move to China where there's no
[36:23.480 --> 36:28.720]  controls so that's coming up sex offenders paid to babysit Chicago
[36:28.720 --> 36:32.680]  Tribune there's a lot more to this story than just what they're reporting the
[36:32.680 --> 36:36.520]  State Department of Human Services poorly vetted babysitters for years and
[36:36.520 --> 36:41.080]  when in 2009 law forced better checks it took nearly 18 months to start them the
[36:41.080 --> 36:46.680]  newspaper investigation on child care assistance program multiple-time rapist
[36:46.680 --> 36:53.400]  drug dealers pedophiles well remember five years ago CNN reported on it
[36:53.400 --> 36:57.240]  thousands of missing children in Florida and the CPS was taking them out of
[36:57.240 --> 37:00.800]  state that turned out the number one number two and number three heads of
[37:00.800 --> 37:05.560]  CPS were all convicted child rapist they said oh what an accident it's not an
[37:05.560 --> 37:10.320]  accident that's who they recruit I heard Travis County a few months ago on the
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.040]  news they played a clip of commissioners court trying to pass a law at the county
[37:15.040 --> 37:20.760]  level that they can hire felons and quite frankly they put so many people in
[37:20.760 --> 37:24.760]  prison who don't deserve to be felons I could see that or this giant prison
[37:24.760 --> 37:29.000]  population but the problem is then they want to hire criminals because they're
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.640]  criminals all right so that's coming up secret vaccine industry ties and
[37:35.640 --> 37:39.960]  military involvement with Institute of Medicine we're gonna get into Libyan
[37:39.960 --> 37:43.320]  rebels killing black Gaddafi supporters that's now confirmed even the
[37:43.320 --> 37:47.840]  Washington Post as expected widespread racist murders in Libya at the hands of
[37:47.840 --> 37:53.080]  rebel forces revealed Al Qaeda King pin a zoo military commander of Tripoli
[37:53.080 --> 37:58.480]  that's now confirmed BBC responds over false Tripoli footage they put out fake
[37:58.480 --> 38:04.960]  video of people celebrating told you now it's admitted Lockerbie case Libyans
[38:04.960 --> 38:08.880]  won't deport bomber the new Al Qaeda leaders won't want deporting meet the
[38:08.880 --> 38:13.480]  new boss same as the old boss or even worse the liberation of Libya NATO
[38:13.480 --> 38:20.200]  special forces Al Qaeda join hands Libya the greatest betrayal and handing over
[38:20.200 --> 38:26.760]  Libya to Al Qaeda the line has been crossed forever Tripoli psychiatric
[38:26.760 --> 38:30.760]  hospital overwhelmed by war fallout absolute humanitarian disaster over
[38:30.760 --> 38:34.640]  there and it's not like Gaddafi was still engaging in terror he rolled over for
[38:34.640 --> 38:38.400]  seven years sort of giving all the major investments to Goldman Sachs and others
[38:38.400 --> 38:43.120]  he's sold out to the globalist he's a bad guy they're bad but you notice that
[38:43.120 --> 38:46.920]  right when he tried to come in out of the dark coming out of the cold that's
[38:46.920 --> 38:53.240]  when they set him up and are now putting folks even worse in okay only in
[38:53.240 --> 38:57.280]  America as Don King would say let's talk to Joe and Pennsylvania you're on the
[38:57.280 --> 39:03.600]  air Joe Alex greetings from the city of brotherly corruption yes sir have you
[39:03.600 --> 39:09.640]  seen anything about this Army Ranger captain John Leonard England who killed
[39:09.640 --> 39:16.880]  four people in two states over here during the hurricane no but but we could
[39:16.880 --> 39:22.600]  search his name let me just get my mouse working here this mouse is driving me
[39:22.600 --> 39:31.480]  insane it either moves too easily or won't move what's his name it's John
[39:31.480 --> 39:41.040]  Leonard and the last name is EG LAND yeah there it is police Virginia soldier
[39:41.040 --> 39:48.680]  kills four in Virginia PA shoots cop kills himself and I'll learn more about
[39:48.680 --> 39:54.920]  that but tell us about it well it seems like this guy from the stories I've
[39:54.920 --> 39:58.240]  read it looks like they're making out to be some sort of domestic dispute he
[39:58.240 --> 40:04.280]  apparently killed his estranged wife her boyfriend the boyfriend son and then
[40:04.280 --> 40:08.880]  traveled up here to Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia and killed her mother
[40:08.880 --> 40:13.000]  well any cop will tell you domestic disputes are the worst that Richard
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.040]  Poplowski that killed three cops he had two pit bulls that were urinating
[40:18.040 --> 40:21.120]  everywhere his mother said you're kicked out of the house if you don't get rid
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.800]  of him he threw a fit she called the cops he was drunk he killed the cops and
[40:25.800 --> 40:30.000]  then it turned out he hated me and was attacking me all over the Internet so
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.720]  what did the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center do they said that he loved me any
[40:35.720 --> 40:43.920]  excuse to demonize this radio show that's that's the the ADL Southern
[40:43.920 --> 40:47.480]  Poverty Law Center is immediately what I thought of with that warning about
[40:47.480 --> 40:53.360]  returning veterans coming and how they could pose the most danger to us
[40:53.360 --> 40:59.680]  ordinary citizens it's just there's something not right about this story
[40:59.680 --> 41:03.880]  and then he apparently kills himself after he drops off his daughter at a
[41:03.880 --> 41:10.520]  local hospital and then goes off into the woods and kills himself although
[41:10.520 --> 41:15.520]  nothing's been officially declared well I'll tell you the veterans are not the
[41:15.520 --> 41:23.240]  number one threat for quote terrorism but as their pensions get cut as they look
[41:23.240 --> 41:26.240]  I appreciate your call let me just briefly speak to this since you raised
[41:26.240 --> 41:33.920]  it if you take men and you put them in one two three four five or even six
[41:33.920 --> 41:41.240]  tours of heavy combat especially special forces types and what they know
[41:41.240 --> 41:48.080]  how to do is release their killer instinct and they've got post traumatic
[41:48.080 --> 41:53.160]  stress issues and they come home and the government takes their pension
[41:53.160 --> 41:57.200]  funds away through inflation and through cuts as they're now announcing
[41:57.200 --> 42:01.200]  they're gonna do and as family pressures and everything else happens
[42:01.200 --> 42:05.640]  imagine you're a veteran you come home you've been through absolute hell you're
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.440]  back and spoiled rotten America with a bunch of people griping complaining at
[42:09.440 --> 42:13.160]  you and all you know how to do is kill people you're gonna go crazy and you're
[42:13.160 --> 42:16.440]  gonna kill a bunch of people that's why the postal service has the term going
[42:16.440 --> 42:20.880]  postal because it's full of veterans and people because they give veterans
[42:20.880 --> 42:27.920]  preferential hiring and you've got a bunch of vets in there and whenever
[42:27.920 --> 42:32.560]  things go wrong it's been advertised to them as a way to deal with it is kill
[42:32.560 --> 42:39.080]  your supervisor kill yourself that's what's gonna happen now you add to this
[42:39.080 --> 42:43.480]  that you you have a lot of suicides and killings with one tour in Vietnam or one
[42:43.480 --> 42:48.320]  tour in Korea or World War two I mean everybody knows about the old vet that
[42:48.320 --> 42:53.280]  lives down the street and I got to tell you all the old vets I knew that were
[42:53.280 --> 42:57.960]  my grandfather's World War two buddies they were all really nice but you'd
[42:57.960 --> 43:01.680]  hear stories about them you know if anybody crossed them or anything they
[43:01.680 --> 43:05.800]  were just ready to kill that's why the police always leave the old vets alone
[43:05.800 --> 43:09.920]  because they know this person is just ready to start killing people and that's
[43:09.920 --> 43:13.800]  the way it works and that's why it's so dangerous they're hiring people that have
[43:13.800 --> 43:18.680]  not been in one tour but two three four five six they found out in World War
[43:18.680 --> 43:24.680]  one don't have somebody serve more than one year in combat some people thrive in
[43:24.680 --> 43:33.240]  it but a big percentage 35 40% become extremely unstable now what are they
[43:33.240 --> 43:37.200]  doing when we showed you the DPS memo here in Texas a month ago they are
[43:37.200 --> 43:43.360]  quietly discriminating and only trying to hire combat veterans now what's gonna
[43:43.360 --> 43:48.680]  happen with a combat veteran who's got serious screws loose when they pull you
[43:48.680 --> 43:52.840]  over and tell you they want to search your car and you say no they're gonna
[43:52.840 --> 43:56.720]  pistol whip you they're gonna taser you they're gonna shoot you that's why more
[43:56.720 --> 43:59.800]  and more you'll see veteran cops they just get someone on the ground nobody
[43:59.800 --> 44:04.120]  knows why they just start shooting people because they have flashbacks this
[44:04.120 --> 44:08.480]  I've had family that came back from Vietnam and for two years after there'd
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.280]  be a backfire on the street they jump under the table because you know they'd
[44:12.280 --> 44:17.000]  been at bases with mortar attacks I mean this is just what happens and so
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.600]  we're gonna have a giant police force made up of military and but then it gets
[44:20.600 --> 44:25.600]  worse for at least a decade they've been testing and fediments amnesic
[44:25.600 --> 44:32.200]  steroids aggression drugs on the troops they have got them so hopped up on drugs
[44:32.200 --> 44:37.680]  it would make your head spin they're giving them experimental malaria drugs
[44:37.680 --> 44:41.080]  that admittedly caused psychotic breaks then when they get home and are
[44:41.080 --> 44:46.400]  depressed they give them what do they give them prozac type drugs on their own
[44:46.400 --> 44:51.040]  insert says causes psychotic breaks psychotic behavior you give a battle
[44:51.040 --> 44:57.160]  hardened killer and that's what they are they're killers they're trained killers
[44:57.160 --> 45:03.600]  they're trained to kill people to blow things up to burn things the army
[45:03.600 --> 45:08.280]  admits they have troops in Afghanistan Iraq where they go in villages and kill
[45:08.280 --> 45:15.760]  everyone kill everyone and now they're going to come back here and they're
[45:15.760 --> 45:18.560]  going to kill people
[45:19.640 --> 45:22.480]  we're gonna get to that shady news a little bit later I'm gonna continue with
[45:22.480 --> 45:26.160]  calls here let's go to let's go to Johnny and Kansas you're on the air
[45:26.160 --> 45:32.440]  welcome hey Alex yes sir you're doing a fantastic job man I mean I've been
[45:32.440 --> 45:39.000]  listening to you since about 99 and I used to try to get on your show and it
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.520]  was a challenge at best well good to have you here what's on your mind
[45:44.520 --> 45:51.440]  sorry about that hey got a couple of things here we just had a vet that's
[45:51.440 --> 45:57.280]  supposed to have went off here and I think he started Oklahoma and according
[45:57.280 --> 46:03.640]  to the stories on the news he raped a 12 or 13 year old girl and then be lying
[46:03.640 --> 46:08.080]  to Texas have you heard about that they just caught him no but I see articles
[46:08.080 --> 46:14.520]  every day about that's going crazy this one here as it as it laid out in front
[46:14.520 --> 46:20.560]  of me it struck me that this guy was kind of sounds like a hi-op oh you know
[46:20.560 --> 46:25.440]  that's gonna happen it's a shy op to advertise first behind the scenes and
[46:25.440 --> 46:30.960]  now publicly that vets are gonna start IDing improvised explosive devising
[46:30.960 --> 46:35.280]  every police department in the country they tell cops vets will attack you now
[46:35.280 --> 46:40.280]  they advertise it so unstable people are and the system knows exactly what
[46:40.280 --> 46:45.840]  they're doing you're gonna hear that and think I won't go shoot up my family I'll
[46:45.840 --> 46:51.600]  I'll bomb someone and so they're advertising it again every time somebody
[46:51.600 --> 46:55.640]  jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge and they and they advertise it other copycatters
[46:55.640 --> 47:01.480]  rush to do it every time somebody climbs the enclosures at major high rises in
[47:01.480 --> 47:05.480]  Chicago New York or LA and jumps off cops are stationed for the next two days
[47:05.480 --> 47:10.600]  because crazy see it on the news and go I'm gonna do that and that's why when
[47:10.600 --> 47:15.280]  this country's faced real terrorism in the 60s and 70s some of its Soviet funded
[47:15.280 --> 47:23.160]  they would not give it attention in the news when real terrorism is ignored only
[47:23.160 --> 47:27.760]  fake terrorism is promoted go ahead let's get on to some national terrorism
[47:27.760 --> 47:32.680]  what the earthquake and the hurricane yes all right have you heard that the
[47:32.680 --> 47:35.920]  they've got evidence that the earthquake was a nuclear detonation
[47:35.920 --> 47:41.320]  underground I know that there's underground areas in Colorado and DC and
[47:41.320 --> 47:46.240]  I know that scientists have said it was highly unusual in both places but
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.800]  particularly in Virginia and DC and I know that they have these type of
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.880]  systems but I don't think there's any evidence to the fact that I've seen I
[47:54.880 --> 47:59.760]  mean I've seen the sites that always speculate some information come out of
[47:59.760 --> 48:06.160]  Canada that had the actual supposedly had the actual seismology graph that
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.280]  showed the earthquake and there was no buildup like a natural her no I did see
[48:10.280 --> 48:13.400]  that even the Washington Post said there wasn't a buildup and it and there
[48:13.400 --> 48:19.000]  wasn't plates in that area it's very unusual very suspicious and you know
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.480]  that's why I read the New York Times admitting that you can create earthquakes
[48:22.480 --> 48:28.280]  with explosives they can drill pump the explosives in detonate them if they
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.600]  have the computer maps of the seismology if they detonate it right in the key
[48:32.600 --> 48:37.960]  area I appreciate your call interesting points to hear from you Tim let's go now
[48:37.960 --> 48:48.120]  to Tina in Indiana you're on the air go ahead hi Alex it's actually teeny but
[48:48.120 --> 48:54.320]  that's okay I wanted to ask did you know anything about the pharmacist giving
[48:54.320 --> 49:00.520]  out flu shots that it's mandatory for them to do that and they also they have
[49:00.520 --> 49:04.560]  to have a quota that they got a meet for these flu shots well I know they admit
[49:04.560 --> 49:07.720]  now there's quotas for cops to give tickets and generate revenue and I
[49:07.720 --> 49:11.920]  know that they do tell it some of the big chains because I've been sent the
[49:11.920 --> 49:16.440]  memos on it by pharmacists that it's their job to basically push flu
[49:16.440 --> 49:22.640]  vaccines just like businesses push a customer loyalty card and I know that
[49:22.640 --> 49:26.440]  I've gone to get a prescription filled and had them pushing on me so I start
[49:26.440 --> 49:31.120]  preaching at them and I know that they are trying to order pharmacist and
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.520]  medical workers to take vaccines to be able to work in the medical field but
[49:36.520 --> 49:42.360]  lawsuits have have borne out that that's unlawful and uncivil and you can lose a
[49:42.360 --> 49:50.640]  lawsuit so yeah they try to bushwhack and and bamboozle doctors nurses people
[49:50.640 --> 49:57.840]  that janitors and hospitals pharmacists to take vaccines and but the last H1
[49:57.840 --> 50:01.640]  anyone shot they admitted doubles your chances of getting the regular flu I
[50:01.640 --> 50:04.720]  mean that that's the Canadian government admits that as a dangerous
[50:04.720 --> 50:10.240]  vaccine I mean it's real simple I'm sorry go ahead a pharmacist because I was
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.880]  talking to her about it and I had mentioned to her I says don't you know
[50:14.880 --> 50:20.000]  that your flu shots have mercury in them and they're going oh yeah we know but
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.320]  it's just such a low dose that even pregnant people can take it and I'm
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.200]  going oh my god yeah you know until two years ago in every medical manual
[50:28.200 --> 50:31.600]  worldwide in fact we posted an article by doctor last week about this it said
[50:31.600 --> 50:37.520]  do not give a vaccine to a pregnant woman not just the mercury but the auto
[50:37.520 --> 50:44.240]  immune response can cause a abortion a miscarriage and now they say it's good
[50:44.240 --> 50:49.080]  for pregnant women to take them I just like Rick Perry says you know take this
[50:49.080 --> 50:54.240]  regardless they'll shot it'll maybe or kill you but hey take it stay there I
[50:54.240 --> 50:57.760]  want to hear more of what your pharmacist friend told you on the other
[50:57.760 --> 51:02.200]  side I'm gonna go to other calls stay with us we all know that Berkey water

[56:00.360 --> 56:05.600]  Indiana so briefly what did you what did the pharmacist tell you well she just
[56:05.600 --> 56:10.720]  basically told me that mercury you know it was such a low dose in there that it's
[56:10.720 --> 56:16.280]  not harmful and you know after I heard that I just couldn't think anymore you
[56:16.280 --> 56:19.480]  know and when they tell her she has to take it to have her job she doesn't
[56:19.480 --> 56:24.360]  ask to see the law or ask to see the regulation I will see the thing is as I
[56:24.360 --> 56:29.560]  worked at that pharmacy that the with the pharmacist that I spoke with I worked
[56:29.560 --> 56:36.240]  there and let me tell you I'm 53 years old the last time I went to the doctor
[56:36.240 --> 56:42.160]  was the day my daughter was born she's 32 years old I'm healthy I don't need to
[56:42.160 --> 56:45.080]  go to the doctor and get all these medications and when I started working
[56:45.080 --> 56:50.400]  at the pharmacy I said to myself now I know why I don't go to the doctor you
[56:50.400 --> 56:53.800]  know because I don't want them to prescribe me for things that every week
[56:53.800 --> 56:59.320]  people that I've known for years I hear that they've died and it's always when
[56:59.320 --> 57:05.040]  they go in for a spider bite that's gotten well but the doctor wants to cut
[57:05.040 --> 57:08.880]  it out or it's when they go in to have a hernia fixed and they die of flesh
[57:08.880 --> 57:13.560]  eating bacteria I mean I have lost so many friends and acquaintances who go
[57:13.560 --> 57:16.840]  in totally healthy and are killed in the hospital and the government even
[57:16.840 --> 57:24.080]  admits 350,000 people die from negligent complications 300 plus thousand die from
[57:24.080 --> 57:28.160]  drug interactions I mean the most dangerous thing in America are the
[57:28.160 --> 57:33.680]  hospitals I'm not saying that hospitals aren't great for trauma like a broken leg
[57:33.680 --> 57:36.840]  or a car wreck and there are a lot of great doctors but there's also a lot of
[57:36.840 --> 57:41.520]  doctors who shouldn't be doctors and it's only getting worse I mean I stay
[57:41.520 --> 57:48.760]  away from the hospital like the plague I appreciate your call let's go to I don't
[57:48.760 --> 57:51.720]  want to cut this caller short but we'll see here let's talk to Tim in Utah Tim
[57:51.720 --> 57:58.480]  you're on the air hey Alex yes sir I appreciate your 70s bumper music you
[57:58.480 --> 58:03.400]  have back in time I got a couple questions I've been studying the fascist
[58:03.400 --> 58:07.960]  globalist control freaks for about 20 years and a couple weeks ago you were
[58:07.960 --> 58:11.440]  talking about suppressed high-tech that they've been developing you know the
[58:11.440 --> 58:15.480]  last few decades why do you think they never really roll that stuff out to
[58:15.480 --> 58:20.000]  scare the heck out of people they just like play with it a little bit here and
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.520]  there but they don't really take advantage of all that technology that
[58:23.520 --> 58:28.400]  they've been developing does it just seem like there's something else going on
[58:28.400 --> 58:32.640]  in their heads that they don't want to use that kind of stuff to scare people
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.040]  that they're both bad for some reason let me let me try to answer the question
[58:37.040 --> 58:40.280]  we come back in the second hour
[58:42.520 --> 58:49.160]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:33.080]  we are now into our number two I'm gonna get into some important medical news
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:41.240]  military libya news CIA militarized actions in Somalia and other areas
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.800]  coming up in the next segment then we'll continue with your phone calls all
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.640]  the way into the third hour when we are joined by Mike Adams with some breaking
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:57.080]  news coming up again in the third hour the last hour today but Tim in Utah if
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.840]  you just joined us ask a very sophisticated question that would really
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:07.680]  take a dissertation to try to answer properly but I'll try to be succinct
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:16.880]  and then get his take on it the military industrial complex has developed with
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:24.360]  their unlimited trillions of us taxpayer money a lot of super science these
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:30.120]  are science fiction term they created artificial suns 30 years ago they
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.720]  created black holes 20 years ago they're always announcing Japanese for the
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:40.160]  first time make black hole you know three years ago and I can go pull up the
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:46.360]  DARPA test decades ago they have done incredible things in cyclotrons and
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:52.360]  superconducting super colliders there has been a 60-year deep base program
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.000]  that's admitted but the details aren't known I've gotten some pieces of that
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:06.480]  from military personnel and others it's very credible the point is there's a
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.720]  lot going on we don't know but we have examples of the SR 71 blackbird in
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.040]  service in the mid 50s they're saying it's the fastest plane in the world
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.000]  still today does anyone really believe that 20 years after they say they had it
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.360]  in the late 80s they unveiled the B2 bomber you see the stealth helicopter
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.400]  crash my military sources say that's three generations ago or 30 years ago
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:40.360]  that's a very old helicopter that crashed there in the fake bin Laden raid so
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.320]  what's happening is the globalist have won a world government they say to keep
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.560]  dangerous technologies from getting out of the wrong hands they want a global
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:53.640]  tyranny they say to stop other rogue nations from developing the systems
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:03:01.240]  they've already discovered and so they don't want to let the public understand
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.880]  all the developments and technologies that they discovered but haven't yet
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:12.080]  absolutely mastered they can extend life normally you die in one year of cancer
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:18.520]  the pancreas Steve Jobs almost eight you know the globalist don't control the
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.560]  world yet they're able to steer it they're able to dominate it but not
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:27.080]  control it not a hundred percent they're able to play different groups off against
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:34.680]  each other they're able to flip sides so they haven't rolled out the technologies
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.920]  because they want to have a limited dole out of the technology so they can
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:44.600]  control it and master it and then sell the last generation to their enemies to
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.920]  entice them into war and war with their neighbors but they don't want to roll
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:55.280]  out the super systems because then if those get in other people's hands down
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.560]  the road because once you roll them out they invariably get sold in the black
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.680]  market then they've got to deal with that problem but more and more they are
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.200]  starting to come out with it but you know they said by 2012 they want half the
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.080]  air force to be drone they're well in line to do it by 2020 and almost the entire
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.840]  air force except troop carriers will be robot and they'll be controlled by
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.800]  robots not by humans the mission will be programmed it'll be given by a human
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.440]  but then the machines will carry out most the decisions and that's the big
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:30.040]  holy grail that the system is looking for they're looking to completely take
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.240]  humans out of the equation so I'll come back and get your take on that Tim and
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.240]  get into some other super technologies as well that they test on the public they
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.760]  test all this medical stuff on us and then what works is circuited away not
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:49.080]  approved and kept at special research government facilities and then doled out
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:54.920]  to a Steve Jobs I mean he got something 99% fatal in a year two years and he's
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:00.080]  lived almost eight so there's your life extension we're right back
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:10.400]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.160]  says that the state is God the United States has now recognized globally as

[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:40.800]  many of the technologies they developed decades ago and we know that they do do
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.720]  that well it's very simple there's a lot of reasons but they want to have the
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:51.880]  sneak attack capability on the few enemies they've got left they also like
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:58.000]  to keep large areas of what's happening secret from the American people that's
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.280]  why since 1947 the CIA and 14 other intelligence agencies have been able to
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.360]  operate separately from the government and do whatever they want and now the
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:13.640]  Federal Reserve can get up on Lair News hour and that famous clip from a few
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:19.280]  years ago with Alan Greenspan and say we are above the law Congress can say
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.880]  nothing they have no jurisdiction over us what an incredible arrogant statement
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.800]  so we haven't been a free country for a very very long time they let us gripe
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.600]  and complain down here at the grassroots level but they have built behind
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.360]  government and corporate reservation walls in their laboratories in their
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:49.840]  bunkers a lot of secret technologies both nuclear dealing with fission
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:55.680]  communications weaponry genetic engineering I mean here's an example a
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.680]  few months ago the BBC and others came out and said oh yes one company in
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.520]  England with the government's knowledge has made hundreds of human animal
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:09.200]  clone splices but don't worry we kill them before the embryos grow up to be
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.360]  too big and this was just kept from the public because it might have upset people
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:19.360]  well I read the exact same type of articles in 1996 yes we cloned humans
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.680]  and spliced them with animals many years ago but we're just now telling you
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:28.800]  about it it's always the same playbooks I saw a YouTube video last week it meant
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:37.680]  to play it here where it showed Barack Obama side-by-side at the podium saying
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:44.400]  the exact words in the exact order of Jimmy Carter they just changed the date
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:53.480]  and changed a few little points and it was amazing it was absolutely amazing
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.960]  and it's like but Jimmy Carter failed Jimmy Carter was a failure no he was a
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:02.960]  success he was meant to take the blame for everything that happened he was meant
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:07.560]  to be an interim candidate to then bring in Ronald Reagan as the savior just
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.600]  like Rick Perry has been prepared and now billed as the next Ronald Reagan I
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.560]  told you he will run he'll have a fake pledge and he's probably going to get
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:21.440]  Sarah Palin on his ticket later and I told you he'll be billed as Ronald
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:28.280]  Reagan I'm on record two years ago a year ago six months ago with absolute
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:36.800]  precision now why is that a I have sources B I've learned the globalist
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:43.160]  modus operandi they do the same stuff over and over again with only slight
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:48.280]  variations if something has worked for them before they will follow a pattern
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:58.880]  and then use the same script they know what they're doing but once you're
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:03.440]  aware of the playbook you're like how dumb am I not to not to understand that
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:11.080]  it's a play it's a scam the whole world is a stage each of us actors upon it
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:18.240]  as Shakespeare said well I'm not a actor in their system I see it or the
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.640]  amusement park it is and I'm outside the amusement park I'm trying to live in
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.920]  the real world we all look through rose-colored glasses all of us distort
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.440]  reality from one way or another because we have limited information and can't
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.960]  see over the horizon but but I live in the real world I read the globalist
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.960]  policy reports that they're so arrogant they put out publicly thinking you're
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:44.240]  not going to read them and so they've created these high-tech reservations and
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:51.480]  they only dole stuff out generally when it's 30 years old I mean my dad remembers
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.200]  being in college in the 60s and seedy rom and how they were gonna have touch
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.200]  screens and and and how everything was gonna work and then they claimed Bill
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:05.440]  Gates and all these people come out with it I've seen countless science fiction
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:11.960]  movies where you'll see them walking around with what looks like an iPad
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:17.160]  doing things on it from 30 years ago that's all predicted programming they
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.120]  go to Hollywood and they say put this in your film you know they go to a MIT
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.840]  advisor that tells them as a consultant and they pay him what should I put in
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.480]  here well this is what's gonna be in the future just like the CIA went to Fox and
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:33.880]  said we want you to put a plane flying into the World Trade Center to be blamed
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.000]  on Afghanistan but really it's the government doing it and it's a drill
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.880]  so they stand down and then the exact thing thing has done six months later
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:49.280]  they understand your brain only gets shocked by what it's never experienced
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:55.280]  how do you domesticate a horse you get out and you walk around him for a few
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:03.000]  weeks you're bringing food you feed them carrots you train them to let you pet
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.600]  them and the way ancients did it with pure wild horses is they would then pin
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:14.920]  the horses and when a baby was born they would domesticate that baby and train
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.880]  it and then they would breed it with the other horses that have been
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:24.560]  domesticated they would eat if you dig into any ancient mound especially the
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.760]  Romans and others you'll find a lot of horse bones horse was actually seen as
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:36.200]  more tasty by the Romans than even cattle beef and the horses that were
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:42.400]  spirited horses that were aggressive they just ate them just like dogs that
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.720]  were not the right shape or size whatever they were breeding them for you
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.680]  would just throw them in the river break their neck throw them in the river put
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.880]  them in a cage throw them in the river or if you were hungry you'd knock them on
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:01.040]  the head and roast them all the European dig sites they find dog what do you think
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:06.960]  Roman legions ate when they ran out of horses they hate everything including
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:13.560]  rats the Romans carried actually mice in big urns that they fed trash to and then
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:23.280]  they would they would roast mice but I now digress and I want to go back to your
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.200]  calls and some other news but they don't want to roll out the technologies they
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:32.040]  want to keep them behind a national security reservation while they grow
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:38.080]  and develop those systems so that any other country or region or company or
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:43.120]  individual can't see the technology in action and then try to reverse engineer
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.560]  it they want to build these systems in secret and then roll them out later if
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:53.040]  they need them does that answer your question Tim yeah I I worked at area 52
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.520]  in Nevada about the early 90s and the rumors were that there was Star Trek
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:03.000]  type technology that was being suppressed not you know I think I saw the
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.520]  Aurora in the 70s actually fly over my head one night but it seems like
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:16.360]  51 or 52 I worked at 52 I was right next to 51 and you know of course there be
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:23.560]  lots of rumors flying around about what was going on at 51 and you know like I
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.680]  said it was Star Trek type technology holographic technology and all kinds of
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.560]  things that they were well we know they've got that and have been testing it
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.960]  where they can project flying saucers Buddha Mohammed Christ wherever they
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.480]  want that that much has been admitted and now we have the New York Times and
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:43.760]  others calling for a fake alien invasion to unify the world that's how dumb they
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:48.000]  think we are and see that's a big top media guy a script writer telling the
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:55.160]  rest of the media get ready for fake alien stuff so that's definitely what
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:17:02.040]  else did you learn well and there was you know it was during the time when what
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:06.920]  was the book behold the pale horse was out and all that kind of questionable
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.320]  alien stuff but I always thought it was just the government creating all that
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:15.920]  type of thing the you know anti-gravity type stuff or where I was
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:21.040]  specifically we didn't have super high tech we had like hand geometry readers
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:25.360]  and that kind of thing the stealth fighters were there but you know the
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:30.000]  big stuff that really cool stuff was at 51 according to all the rumors but one
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.600]  thing I've been at wondering is is there almost a religious reason I'd use a
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:39.320]  word religion but a religious reason why the control freaks don't bring all this
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:43.200]  stuff out because there's essentially three stages of control freaks there's
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.840]  the manipulation intimidation and then outright force and it seems like they're
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:52.760]  almost trying to get us to do what they want us to do without taking it to the
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.080]  limit you know just using manipulation a little bit intimidation here and there
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:00.080]  well that's the thing once they started keeping technology secret when they
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:06.440]  trot them out people go you mean there's a secret government right I mean
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.760]  that's the thing you realize there's something going on underneath at all but
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.720]  the average Joe just reading the paper watching TV doesn't understand that's
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.500]  what's going on and what was the name of the base it was a tonal path on a pot
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:25.760]  test range yeah right and closed down in 90 well quote unquote closed down at 92
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:30.680]  so there's still stuff I'm sure well what did the guys on the base say they
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:37.760]  had heard was it 51 well besides the you know the flying stuff and I I had seen
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:41.440]  the flying stuff at night oh no that's what I've been told by insiders is
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:46.160]  there's nothing alien they've got auroras big troop carrying flying V's
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.080]  which they now are basically admitting the public they have and big projector
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:56.480]  systems for holograms and bio weapons research underground well and and you
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.960]  can see you could see them flying around at night and they'd be doing like you
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.960]  know 90 degree turns you know no problem at all you know and I saw one night
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.800]  there's like 15 or 20 of them out in the air and they were just shooting around
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.280]  dancing almost around each other you know what this is too important I want
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.320]  to hear more about this will you do five more minutes on the other side and I'll
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:20.600]  give you the floor to tell folks these stories sure no problem I'm gonna put
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:24.400]  on all those we're going to break but my dad wished that he'd have brought his
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.720]  telescope because he's got a little telescope you can hook a digital camera
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.760]  into and we've got an incredible footage the problem is you can track a
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.880]  planet with the computer system it's hard to track a craft but I was like oh
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.040]  dad I want to go to monument Utah again monument valley like when we were a
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:43.440]  kid he goes oh I almost forgot he spent like a week and a half in Montana and
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:49.080]  Utah visiting friends he said he would sit outside at night and watch stuff at
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.160]  high altitude look like satellite space altitude you see satellites in the
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:58.440]  clear night he said they were doing 90 degree turns look like they were going
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.840]  like 5,000 miles an hour what would you do with a check for $25,000 what if you

[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:08.920]  know it's funny I was talking about my dad just getting back from vacation and
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:13.040]  Wyoming and Montana mainly up there looking at fossils and going to dinosaur
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:18.760]  digs and then I go out of the studio and he had dropped some stuff off I'd
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.160]  forgot at his house this weekend when I was over there for my grandmother's
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.000]  birthday and so I drug my dad in here now he didn't want to be on camera he
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.240]  didn't want to actually be in there actually physically grabbed him and
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.320]  forced him down in the seat but and then we're gonna come back and go to that
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.960]  caller after the break who can tell us about area 52 because I'm holding that
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:40.800]  go over because everything he's saying is the exact same info I've got from
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.240]  people that were actually at both bases but dad tell us your experiences like
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:48.800]  once when we were I was six seven years old we were driving back from East
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:53.600]  Texas on 45 we looked out the window and flying low or three things that look
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.000]  like super stealth fighters but but but more advanced than anything you've seen
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.840]  today almost like a stealth SR 71 but they were like gray and look like
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.720]  something out of a science fiction movie when you were a kid you saw the
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:11.640]  blackbird there in East Texas but tell folks well tell folks about both those
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.480]  experiences but also what you just saw in Wyoming or was it Montana
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:21.000]  I was in northern Wyoming not far from Montana but in freestone and Leon County
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.540]  they used to do a lot of testing they would drop shaft out of airplanes and
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:28.480]  everything and one time I was early morning walking up to our school and
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.720]  all of a sudden a a Delta winged airplane that was black went over looked
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.720]  like 50 feet over the building with a sonic boom and at that time I wanted to
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.440]  be the first kid on the moon and I would drew pictures of it and it literally
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:47.640]  was a was the blackbird and so Lord knows what they have now but we were up
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:53.080]  and sitting on the second floor porch of a friend's house and we were talking
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.520]  about satellites and how they moved and everything and our friends said well you
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.920]  know we watch satellites going across and they'll suddenly make a right angle
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:06.520]  and I was saying well if they're at any any altitude that would involve
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.760]  incredible g-forces and just as amazing and about that time we literally saw a
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.960]  satellite that was tracking that looked like it was essentially going to the
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:21.240]  south just suddenly turned and went to the now you're a pilot you're a pilot
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.320]  what type of cheese are those well I have no idea it depends if it was
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:29.000]  something small that was real close it would involve you know higher G's than
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.400]  a pilot could normally tolerate and if it were 10,000 50,000 feet it would be
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.360]  unimaginable and if it were in space it would be something that's beyond the
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.080]  realm of ordinary satellites of the telescopes you know is a satellite you
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:48.440]  can see how high it is because it's in the Sun it's outside the earth blocking
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.840]  the Sun I mean did it look like a satellite it looked like satellite but
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:55.720]  it's unimaginable that something could change direction like that and the
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:00.800]  locals said they see that all the time up there let me ask you the question that
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.920]  the caller asked and of course he knew the answer that's why he's continued it
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.960]  he said the control freaks I don't know if you were listening driving up the
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.880]  control freaks don't want to use total four ship they don't want to show people
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.120]  what they've built because people are going to go you built this whole thing
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.400]  in secret you mean we're living in a kind of frozen technological system where
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.680]  they dole it out why do you think the global controllers are keeping most of
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.360]  these technologies secret I think the main reason is is because things like
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.400]  antibiotics is called what they perceive to be the global population problem so
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.800]  new technologies that extend life and prevent death create what to them as a
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:41.480]  pestilence so if you don't control population issues in their mind it
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:45.560]  creates things that will poison the planet so they've probably feel that
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:50.000]  they need to withhold technologies in order to save the earth well that's what
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.720]  they said a post-industrial world more a strong they've all talked about it and
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.800]  they've done a pretty good job they're shutting the US down right now and
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.200]  moving everything to China because China made a deal to reduce their
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.760]  population to be the new king of the hill but I will tell you if you fly
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:10.160]  around and you go anywhere the earth is unimaginably unpopulated we we are just
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.600]  barely utilizing the potential well humans are like fish we stay in little
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:20.200]  reef areas but that's where commerce is and so we we tend to congregate so
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:24.840]  people have this false illusion that we're overpopulated well it's just like
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:29.040]  people saying that that cows are a problem with global warming due to
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:33.000]  methane I think if someone did a study there's probably less commercial
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.720]  animals alive now than when the buffalo is roamed it'd be a very interesting
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.360]  study today like they've actually done the study there were around the same
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.720]  number of buffalo they believe in the work cows now doesn't matter there's
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:47.800]  always been creatures running around passing gas and and they sell us on the
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.280]  fact that we got to pay Al Gore money or the cow farts are gonna kill us that
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:56.560]  sounds ludicrous but there's truth to it no they've passed them flatulence tax in
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:04.480]  Canada what's interesting is where you see most of the animals are actually in
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.280]  population centers because they're extending water into broader sluice way
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:14.800]  so they have healthy hay exactly exactly most the water ends up going in
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.800]  circles only 1% of the waters fresh humans are maximizing that by bringing
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.240]  it to the surface instead of it just going and aquifers into the sea and so
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.320]  where I live in the country all the animals are coming to my house because
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.680]  we're irrigating that like 50 turkeys in the backyard you ought to hear them
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:33.480]  always getting fights though over a warm or something never heard of turkey fight
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.800]  yeah I have nothing more frightening than a raccoon fight that's right you
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.960]  had a bunch of them breaking your house the other day I had 11 visitors because
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.960]  it's so horrible you're an evil human dad I love you I'm gonna try to give you
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.400]  even more grandkids as it makes the clubblest mad we'll be right back we're

[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:39.560]  okay Tam in Utah thanks for holding tell us your stories about area 52 and some
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.740]  of the things you witness go ahead let me start with saying that I saw the V
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:49.200]  shaped UFO back in 76 before I even started working as a college doing my
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:54.240]  astronomy homework and it flew right overhead didn't make a sound you know I
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:58.200]  looked at my friend that was with me and I was like did you see that he goes yeah
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.040]  and I said I'm glad because I didn't want to be the only one that saw what
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:07.440]  happened and you know from there I always had an interest in UFOs and then
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:12.200]  when I went to work at 52 you know of course there was lots of rumors but it's
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.640]  pretty much common knowledge around that area that you know on any given night
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:21.880]  you might see those things flying around and like I say one night I was out
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:27.920]  with my son and we were south of area 51 and they were dancing in the sky it was
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.680]  incredible I had never seen anything like that as fast as they were and how
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:37.680]  they could make turns and stuff but you know most of the stuff I've under I've
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.900]  learned is just from rumors of what other people that have been to 51 you know
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:46.880]  it's the well there's another reason I'm glad we're actually fleshing this out
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.360]  because it's an important subject and so it's a core subject very important
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:55.080]  couldn't be more important another reason I've been told by high level NASA
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:00.600]  people and others and I mean high level and also some who worked on the Apollo
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:03.720]  program you can see in the films of the Apollo program you know on the front
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:08.600]  line there in mission control is that there's a secret space program and
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.440]  that's admitted we just don't know the details and that the death toll is very
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:17.400]  high and so they learned that very quickly watching astronauts burn to
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:23.520]  death on the launch pad there at the gantry that we better keep this
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:28.360]  experimental stuff secret the guys sign up for it just like special forces sign
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:32.440]  up for it going behind enemy lines and that's what's going on is that they're
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:37.080]  trying to keep the casualty numbers a secret kind of like what you see in the
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:41.680]  end of close encounters where all those guys come out and Dreyfus wants to join
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:47.120]  up with them and you know because that's stuff that I'm sure isn't you know made
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:52.440]  very public to anyone the families are you know it was very hush-hush if you
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:57.480]  worked at 51 what you did you know you work for exactly so you worked at a base
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.960]  with the older secret stuff but but the rumors by the guys on base was the big
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:08.440]  flying V's projection hologram equipment anything else Star Trek technology
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.320]  that's all they said phasers type stuff you know anything you could see off
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:17.720]  Star Trek you know and of course there's always been rumors we could fly out to
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:22.280]  Pluto or something but I never bought into those particularly but anyway
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:25.480]  pretty good you mind if I plug my website real sure what is it it's
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:30.360]  control freak you calm I'll have to I'll have to check that out anything else
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.680]  you forgot to add Tim oh I'll think of it later and call back all right buddy
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:40.160]  good to hear from you all right I'm gonna go to Carlos Roger Dale Zachary I'm
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:44.080]  I'm gonna get to everybody here and we're gonna have open phones once once
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:47.520]  Mike Adams is here but I'm gonna clear the phone system and obviously open the
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:53.480]  phones for subjects he's covering with some breaking breaking news but first I
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:37:01.520]  want to get in to the news but first but first before I do that I I know the
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:05.280]  sales guys are just super deep in making theme music and that's great but I do
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:13.480]  need them to give me that folder now on top of all of this we're launching
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:28.480]  starting Thursday a lot of new powerful media systems at prison planet TV and the

[01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:01.120]  be a condensed focused 30-minute news transmission with reporters in the field
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:06.480]  interviewers joining us or even in a get a fiber optic hookup so it's even
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:13.680]  better than skype in-depth subjects that are really focused in on so the latest
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:21.400]  news key topics covered guest this is a big big undertaking and it is those of
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:25.760]  you that have bought the t-shirts the DVDs the info wars ball caps that have
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.080]  supported our sponsors over the years that are making this possible but we do
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:33.880]  want to be able to continue this operation and expand it so please become
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:38.720]  a prison planet dot TV member today if you let your prison planet dot TV
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:45.720]  membership lapse please re-up it either tomorrow or Wednesday we will launch two
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:52.000]  new functions on prison planet dot TV that I'll announce then so much is coming
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.880]  to prison planet dot TV and of course the nightly news transmission we've had a
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:01.480]  lot of TV offers over the years hey produce a TV show this network will
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:07.400]  carry it or this cable system or places in Germany Japan England the US
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:13.120]  Canada and most of them are channels that have millions of viewers but that's
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.960]  in the aggregate there might be 50,000 people watching at any one time and
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.720]  that's not an inconsequential audience it's just we haven't had the facilities
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:26.280]  the time the money the energy to actually produce something they've said
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.760]  well just give us your daily radio TV show and edit it together and I'm like
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:36.280]  I don't have the energy I don't have the time I don't have the producers but
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.120]  that is something we're gonna do do down the road as well as have a condensed
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:46.320]  news brief every day out of this three-hour show that is tagged on to the
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.680]  nightly news and the special reports and the documentaries that are gonna
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:55.400]  premiere there you know I started six years ago making a JFK documentary and
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:40:01.600]  it turns into a labyrinth a veritable labyrinth of research and facts and proof
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.320]  and now Jackie they released the tapes of her saying LBJ had her husband killed
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.480]  and that intersects with all the other intel we've got from his mistress LBJ's
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.960]  mistress and his lawyer a McClellan that went public and the deathbed
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.280]  confession of E. Howard Hine and again that's as high as they knew it went was
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:24.440]  the president people play the straw man going he's not saying the banks did it
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:31.080]  he's saying LBJ all of our witnesses go as high as LBJ obviously he's controlled
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:35.280]  as well that's why I've got to be careful what I say and what I do because
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:40.200]  the straw man arguments they take whatever I say and then limit it but you
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:44.240]  can't stop people that are being deceptive it's just that Alex Jones covering up
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:48.320]  who really killed Kennedy yeah right we're gonna put that out in a four-part
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:54.000]  documentary we've probably got a hundred hours of interviews alone hundreds and
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.440]  hundreds of hours of doc it's just insane a lot of it never before seen so
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:07.200]  that's coming to prison planet TV and then in the final equation I don't like
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:11.360]  the term prison planet TV prison planets a good website to expose the police
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:16.440]  state prison planet TV eight plus years is a great website and has eight years
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:21.480]  of material but I'm going to segue on the same platform but with even newer
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:27.800]  technologies over to a news type name so if you're a prison planet TV member in
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:31.960]  the future it'll just it'll work on both sides and we'll keep both up in case
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:37.040]  whatever goes down with problems well my membership works right here as well so a
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.120]  lot coming to prison planet TV don't forget the online video slash
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:45.960]  patreon apparel shopping cart at info wars dot com people say oh thank you so

[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:09.040]  speaking of sponsors survival rx legislation like codex element areas
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.760]  threatens our ability to purchase vitamins and supplements in the future
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:16.200]  our new sponsor survival rx as the world's first long-term storable vitamin
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:20.160]  and nutritional supplements they created a proprietary triple nitrogen flush
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:24.000]  manufacturing process that will allow you to store their high-quality vitamins
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.400]  for decades by the way I've ordered some of these this is a great idea from now

[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:59.920]  brave patriotic stations picking this show up and it shows how far the message
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.120]  of liberty has come that Ron Paul's a major presidential contender at the
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.280]  Federal Reserve is on the verge of being audited and extremely unpopular 85% in
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:15.120]  most polls and that this show is now seen as enough mainstream I didn't change
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.760]  my message the world kind of caught up with us and we're getting a lot of great
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:27.240]  stations out there and I want to thank them as well okay let me
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:35.680]  speaking of Mike Adams and suppressed technologies and hidden shadow government
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:41.560]  systems secret vaccine industry ties and military involvement with Institute
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:45.080]  of Medicine that runs around certifying that vaccines aren't hurting people
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:49.400]  despite all the evidence that's coming up the next hour after your calls then
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:55.360]  there's this report that I wrote with Paul Watson just because I find it be so
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:04.960]  interesting speaking of life extension technologies the first artificial heart
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:10.320]  was what in the early 1980s and the guy that got it didn't live very long then
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:13.880]  the next guy lived a little bit longer and the next guy a little bit longer what
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:22.280]  they've learned to do is to put a bionic heart on the outside and then
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:29.520]  ventricle that in to the heart and then use the heart as basically a bag to pump
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.840]  the blood around the body so the pump on the outside does the actual pumping and
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:40.440]  then the heart itself is just used for its valves and you know the heart is
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:44.040]  still there it doesn't cut into all the nerve endings that then cause so many
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:48.360]  other respiration problems in the lungs once you have obviously had your heart
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:53.960]  cut out and so Dick Cheney for now 14 months that's longer than almost
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:57.920]  anybody survived one of these when he got it they said usually it's a stepping
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.640]  stone three to six months hoping that you get a heart transplant so that you
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:07.080]  can survive and in fact very few have survived more than a year with this
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:13.200]  apparatus continually on them and Dick Cheney's done jokes on TV of turning it
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:18.040]  off and he's really a hardcore guy he is tough I mean for somebody to be able to
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:21.800]  enjoy something like this and make jokes out of it that's about the only way you
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:25.360]  can survive they report people pretty much get depressed and die once they
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:30.920]  have them because you no longer have a pulse and so on your screen is the
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:37.080]  external bionic heart that then goes through the body inside the stomach
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:43.520]  cavity up into the chest cavity and pumps blood through the heart and here's
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:49.360]  the headline Dick Cheney one year as a walking zombie former BP marks
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:55.120]  anniversary as member of the living dead although the debate still rages as to
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:00.640]  whether or not he had a pulse to begin with torture approving wiretap loving
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:04.600]  former vice president Dick Cheney recently marked one year as a member of
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:11.120]  the living dead in July last year Cheney had a ventricle assist device and
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:15.080]  planted in his body which leaves most recipients a lot of pulse because it
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:20.800]  pushes blood continuously instead of mimicking the heart's own pulsate beat
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:28.560]  during an interview aired this morning on MSNBC Cheney frightened a reporter
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.480]  with his dawn of the dead style annex removing the battery from his heart
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:38.640]  pump before it started beeping Cheney has survived as a zombie long enough to
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:44.640]  finalize and promote his new memoir my time in which he unapologetically
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.880]  reaffirms his support for torture the invasion of Iraq and warrantless
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.800]  wiretapping the former VP's arrogance has not lessened with age or ill health
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:58.440]  the book fails to even admit a single mistake in the prosecution of the Iraq
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:03.600]  war which still remains unfinished over eight years later and was the basis of
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:12.720]  a cocktail of lies and the seat five hundred and sixty-five pages and a
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:17.200]  simple apology would have been in order and some of them writes conservative
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:21.640]  columnist George will which is to say the great fact of those eight years is
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:28.400]  that we went to war big war costly war under false pretenses and to write
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:34.040]  a memoir in which you see essentially nothing seriously went wrong if I wrote
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:40.960]  a memoir of my last week I would have had things to apologize for that's
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.640]  George will kind of being an apologist in an off-handed way for Lord Cheney
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:49.760]  and then it just goes through some of the crimes of Dick Cheney and the fact
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:53.800]  that he is a zombie because when you don't have a pulse that's the old
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:59.440]  definition of being dead and reportedly Dick Cheney now for close to 14 months
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:05.040]  has not had a pulse speaking of zombies we're going to put on screen for
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.880]  prison planet dot TV viewers a photo that surfaced last Friday I saw it on
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:16.360]  drudge headline shocking photos of Steve Jobs and some Indian website with no
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.360]  proof said it was a fake photo but jobs never came out and said that TMZ got it
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:25.080]  from a reputable news source Pacific Coast news and that when you blow the
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:30.400]  video up there's light on the side of his neck and the sunlight it makes it
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.120]  look like his head's been stuck on there but that's exactly what sunlight does
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:39.360]  that's a real photo he's being supported it I blew up old photos of him
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:43.680]  six months ago when he was extremely frail and looked at the hands it's Steve
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:49.760]  Jobs it's a real photo that's why he announced he's resigning and you know
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:53.800]  I'm sad for Dick Cheney I'm sad for Steve Jobs because despite telling us all
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:49:00.880]  day what great humanitarians they are the fact is Apple contracts with some of
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:05.520]  the most egregious companies in China where they make people stand without
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:10.400]  breaks for 12 hours a day we're talking hundreds of hours of overtime per pay
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.320]  period people committing suicide people being screamed at massive numbers of
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.700]  suicide suicide nets around the buildings and then Al Gore is on the
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:27.600]  Apple board always lecturing us always telling us that we need to do this and
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:32.960]  do that and pay carbon taxes to Al Gore so I hope that Steve Jobs comes out
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:38.040]  before he dies and actually you know says hey we should certify our products
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:41.200]  that they have a living wage there's already groups that do that they could
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:47.240]  set the the mark for four countries that have slave labor to up their wages to a
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:51.040]  living standard and that would pull these people out of abject slavery but
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:56.560]  also then wouldn't bring the US down see when you buy slave goods and we all do
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:01.240]  it to a certain extent when you buy slave goods that destroys your economy
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:06.240]  too and pulls you closer to slave wages it's a giant sucking sound so it truly
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:10.640]  is you reap what you sow now in other news this supposedly came out a week
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:15.000]  ago or a week and a half ago I didn't know about it I disagree with some of
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.280]  his politics but I think he's an honorable underdog guy who has a lot of
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:22.280]  courage and who I respect active as Russell means fighting esophageal
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:27.080]  cancer and we're trying to get him on the show they said they might have been
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:30.400]  able to treat him if he had his tongue removed and part of his throat but he
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.120]  said I will not I will not do something worse than death and have my tongue
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:43.200]  cut out so he is trying tribal remedies and things and we should all pray for
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:46.880]  Russell means and we're also gonna work to get him on the show because he says
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:50.280]  even though he has trouble talking now that he's gonna continue to speak out
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:54.200]  until he dies hopefully he gets better but it's spread all over his body
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:51:02.000]  everybody goes folks death comes for us all remember that remember that life

[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:17.680]  okay Carlos and Oregon thank you for holding her on the air welcome Alex
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:22.360]  good I'm calling today first of all I want to let you know I'm a patriot that
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:27.720]  came to the to the truth movement by yourself and by Adam Aaron I'm sorry
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:33.240]  Aaron Russo rest in peace his memory I'm calling to speak to you today and to
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:36.280]  try to help change your mind and change other patriots minds about the concept
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:41.240]  of immigration into the United States it's a contentious topic and it's a
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:45.200]  topic that's not discussed often enough and when it is discussed I'm not trying
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:49.400]  to call you out or call you any names but it seems to come across as a as a
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.120]  racist sentiment when the word illegal set not necessarily saying that you do
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.600]  that but that happens quite often in the patriot movement listen I'll keep
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:02.440]  you on and listen to you but but but here's the deal Al Gore says say it's
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:09.480]  racism if you don't support paying him money for global warming okay and so it
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:14.000]  uses a weapon so at a certain point I don't care how something sounds here's
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.680]  the deal you got six and a half billion people that want to come here the
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:22.720]  government immediately tries to put them on welfare which further bankrupts the
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.680]  system because that's what the banks want the vast majority of the immigrants
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:29.920]  regardless where they come from think oh the government's here to help me I'll
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:34.520]  vote for socialism and soon they're gonna have enough votes to get rid of the
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:38.920]  Second Amendment private property everything it's not those people
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:43.400]  individually that I have a problem with I got folks of all colors working for
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:48.520]  me I like everybody okay it's that I'm not obsessed with this I know that if
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:53.320]  you come into Mexico they have some of the most draconian illegal alien rules
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:58.360]  in the world six months to a year hard labor if they catch you but that's good
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:02.320]  that's okay their government says but then our government that's been the
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:06.360]  most open out there is saying just come come come this in a hundred years ago
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:10.960]  where there wasn't any welfare and we are bankrupt and so it's the globalist
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:14.760]  or four open borders so that tells me I should be against it now go ahead make
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:18.120]  your point sorry welfare should not be given to new immigrants that's that's a
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:21.560]  falsity to think that welfare should be given to new immigrants new immigrants
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:25.640]  should not receive something that they haven't paid into for one second of all
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:29.080]  you have to look at it as a situation that these people are running from
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:32.840]  something the same way people from other countries run from the disparity in
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:36.680]  their country and the fact they can't get through and can't get past and they
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:39.960]  get stuck and they have two choices they can either run and become an illegal
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.800]  citizen here like my grandfather I mean grandmother and my father did or they
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:47.720]  can be stuck and die where they're at you need to understand that I came I'm a
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:51.320]  first-generation American and I'm a true patriot and I'm fighting for Ron Paul
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:56.360]  and for for the you know sovereignty the United States against the globalist but
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:58.880]  you also have to understand that the only reason this happens and the only
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:03.320]  reason it exists is because of the disparity that the that is happening in
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:08.320]  Mexico these people are refugees they're not illegal immigrants
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:15.640]  Virginia okay well my point is this my point is that if you look back at our
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:20.400]  laws and you look back it wasn't until 1917 that a law was passed that was
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:24.640]  restricting the number of immigrants from Mexico and before that that they
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:28.120]  flow they flew back and forth not flew but you know traveled back and forth
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:33.480]  between Mexico and the United States totally listen listen I totally get it
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:39.320]  that Mexicans have as much a right to be here as anybody else they were here
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:46.720]  before anybody except maybe a few Russians on the west coast I understand
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:51.360]  all that because the Spanish were here the French were here everybody was
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:58.120]  battling over it if Mexico was like Switzerland and you know but with brown
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:03.440]  people I'd be like well fine whatever it's a third-world country under globalist
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:09.840]  control completely collapsing and it's like the US is a lifeboat if we look
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:15.080]  the wages are going down the country's falling apart and look I'm against slave
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:19.480]  labor in prisons you know where they get 25 cents an hour there's all colors in
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:24.560]  there I'm not against the prisoners working I'm against them undercutting
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:29.040]  all the jobs do you see what I'm saying we need to make it so these people can
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:33.560]  come here properly and and not have a draconian immigration listen I might
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:37.200]  not have such a big issue of the welfare wasn't involved and if the
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:46.800]  illegals were like you stay there you are listening to GCN visit GCN live calm
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:56.440]  today hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:01.000]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.960]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:09.600]  turned in this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:14.200]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:18.560]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:23.840]  nation the criminal off-short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:28.120]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:31.640]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:36.920]  check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:42.560]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD

[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:55.840]  Metsha and Laraza meetings I've watched the videotapes I know the big Ford
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:02.200]  Foundation is funding it and for whatever reason politically the federal
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:07.880]  government 40 years ago or so funded the liberation theology just like they
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:14.800]  funded the Taliban and al-Qaeda to radicalize groups so they could then
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:20.120]  play people off against each other I get that I get that and if somebody is
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:24.880]  into the Second Amendment Liberty freedom then I absolutely love them we've
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:32.360]  got a guy works here one of my best people just tireless smart cool I'm even
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:36.560]  trying to talk him into doing some radio max but he worries about
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:40.000]  retribution against his family of Venezuela and he's here legally you
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.160]  know did it all properly and he absolutely hates Hugo Chavez and
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:49.760]  communism and gets it I wouldn't have a problem with 30 million maxes but I'm
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:55.040]  sorry I've looked at the actuaries most of these illegals who are aliens of this
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:00.320]  country that's what Mexico calls illegals that come in are absolutely
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:07.160]  foundation university run constant talk about whitey constant we're gonna set up
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:13.240]  the socialist you know Metsha Laraza and so I've tried to put the word out I've
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:16.760]  even reached out to these groups in Austin and one time I'm like listen I'd
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:21.840]  like you to come on the radio and you know I'd like you to you know understand
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.240]  this listen fat pig gringo this is one of the main leaders of the guy that then
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:31.160]  had the big Metsha parade you know you know we're gonna kick you out of this
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:35.200]  country basically I said that said I'm coming down to bullhorn your event he
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:38.400]  goes you wouldn't dare I dare you something bad and I said okay that said
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:43.400]  I'm coming and I don't care how it looks I'll go out in front of 5,000 Hispanic
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.040]  clan members and tell them to go to Hades I don't care because I just like
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:52.840]  I bullhorn the clan repeatedly but seeing political correctness it's okay to
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:57.520]  have Hispanics be taught to hate white people or and I'm sick of it I mean this
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:01.880]  is a government plan to get us at each other's throats and I have had enough
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:07.060]  Carlos so here's the deal I mean how many Latin Americans do we take do we
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:11.440]  take 700 million that's what's down there in 20 years there's gonna be over a
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:15.920]  billion do we take a billion people up here and I'm sorry I've been to Central
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:19.640]  America I've been down there for whatever reason they never got a culture of
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:24.000]  freedom going and when the and I don't know how to explain it to you it is
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:31.040]  imploding and and I don't have an issue with immigration to this country the
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.520]  problem is is that a large portion of these folks see an American flag on
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:39.800]  somebody's shirt at public school even if the Hispanic kid has the shirt on and
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:44.920]  they're sent home now be honest about it Carlos is there not a large contingent
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:49.680]  of people that see themselves as Mexicans and who think they're quote
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:54.680]  engaging in the law reconquista there is a huge amount of people that do that I
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:57.120]  absolutely agree with you and I absolutely agree that they are
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:00.920]  extremists and these people are attempting to do the same thing on one
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:04.480]  side that extremists do on the other side and on other sides of this of this
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:08.440]  fight and like you said they want us all at each other's throat my only point is
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:13.120]  this Mexicans that come here they come to this country legally they pay taxes
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.720]  because their employees I know this because I've worked for paralegal firms
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:20.120]  that deal with 99% Hispanics and they are told to make sure and put some sort of
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:25.360]  tax wage on their taxes otherwise they might end up getting looked at by the
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:29.560]  federal government they pay no they pay sales taxes and everything I got all
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:34.200]  that let listen all I'm saying is we should have a whole discussion about
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:39.400]  this another day here's another thing the United States within 10 years is
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:44.240]  going to be half Hispanic and Hispanics that are Americans should ask
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:49.400]  themselves are you gonna buy into this Ford Foundation stuff and and and let
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:55.960]  unlimited in because it's gonna destroy your future as well I don't care what
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:05:02.920]  color you are they need to fix their problems in Mexico hi folks this is

[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:16.760]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:21.120]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:25.240]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:29.760]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:33.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:37.800]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:20.120]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:25.240]  finishing up if you just joined us with what I was saying to Carlos earlier it
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:32.280]  was calling from Washington State Hispanics are soon gonna be 50% of the
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:38.520]  US population by 2020 of the US census beliefs so if people look at this from a
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:44.280]  racial position you've won you've won you're America white people don't have
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:48.280]  children anymore white people are in love with their iPods white people have
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:52.440]  lost so much of their soul that they can't even have children you're right
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:58.120]  when met General Raza says look at you you're dead your culture is dead yes yes
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:03.060]  all civilizations commit suicide America has committed suicide Europe's dead
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:08.640]  Pat Buchanan's talked about it death of the West so I would say to the new
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:14.760]  holders of this civilization which was came out of Europe's what set up Latin
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:19.280]  America right out of Spain that you should come back to your western roots
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:26.600]  and that you should embrace it and see America as yours because my issue is I
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:31.240]  care about people in Brazil Mexico you name it I wish they could all come here
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:36.480]  but this country is bankrupt and government and the collectivist go and
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:40.520]  recruit the illegals that come to this country they have their babies here for
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:46.440]  free I can't do that citizens are turned away from emergency rooms they've told
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:50.720]  the 800 plus cities give the illegals health care first this is a fact because
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:55.560]  the corporations use taxpayer funding as an incentive to get the cheap labor
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:59.960]  here to drive down wages further that doesn't help Mexico that then drives
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:03.840]  their wages down further that then drives China's wages down this has all
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:08.880]  been broken down by computers but Ross Perot told you 16 17 years ago giant
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:14.280]  sucking sound when we lower our wages it does not help Mexico it does not help
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:19.200]  China it helps the very few and only in the short term I'm telling you Al Gore
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:25.960]  you're gonna lose our industry that is ridiculous Ross this is a good deal it's
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:32.640]  gonna wait I have to get a real Nelly mode it's gonna do some twinkle eyes I
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:38.440]  can't do twinkle eyes and be a man pair big man bear pig let me try listen Larry
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:46.120]  this is gonna double John next years I mean come on look the globalist are for
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:53.960]  open borders if we we've got plenty of room in this country if there was no
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:11:00.800]  welfare and if we could literally educate these people coming out of
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:05.720]  tyranny about the Constitution Bill of Rights Ron Paul style ideas and then
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:09.720]  once they became citizens said here's your machine gun okay then there wouldn't
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:15.400]  be an issue with maybe another 50 million or so in a couple decades the
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.400]  problem is it takes time to grow the infrastructure see that brings in
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:22.920]  welfare look I don't want to have to get off into the whole science of it the
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:27.120]  issue is people who are American regardless of what color you are you
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:31.720]  gotta look at your children and ask yourself the question the globalist are
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:36.240]  for open borders and unlimited immigration now everything the globalist
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:41.520]  are for is bad for you that's a good rule of thumb but once you intellectually
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:46.440]  and economically and historically look it up you're gonna see the facts there
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:50.980]  you're going to learn that indeed it is bad okay every other country has
[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:57.200]  immigration controls but us we're a joke we're a joke the country is collapsing
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:00.440]  okay that's all I have to say on the subject and you heard the Hispanic
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:05.160]  American guy earlier you know say no I admit it's massive amounts of Hispanics
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:08.960]  are like Laraza get the gringo okay but let's just get it out in the open what
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:11.920]  is I'm not gonna sit here and play along with this game that the government
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:15.800]  foundations didn't engineer this in the universities and high schools it was
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:19.840]  taught where I was I went to Anderson for two years here in Austin I was taught
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:24.120]  white people are evil by the white teachers this is la reconquista the
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:27.520]  Hispanics will get you the whites are evil I was taken to the University of
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:31.960]  Texas in art class and taught by their one of their Chicano studies guys that
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:36.080]  America was bad and then I was bad and I said I don't agree with this Mexico had
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:39.480]  its own atrocities and problems a new history and they totally freaked out how
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:43.160]  to meeting and came up and said how do you know history and and who are you and
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:47.360]  it was like they found a leprechaun or something that I was you know 18 years
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:50.400]  old I was in high school five years didn't really go the first year alright
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:54.240]  I'm gonna shut up now cuz Mike Adams is here it's just a caller brings up a
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:58.520]  subject like that and it just gets me going we'll also go to your calls and
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.920]  Mike and speak on any issue I want to get Mike's take on the latest in Libya I
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:07.080]  want to get his take on some other issues and real environmentalism versus
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:10.680]  this corporates environmentalism where they only use it as an authoritarian
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:15.320]  tool while distracting from all the real environmental issues that are out
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:20.040]  there but Mike Adams of course heads up a natural news he also has been doing a
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:24.120]  rap songs that actually are very popular he tells me he's doing a heavy metal
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:31.040]  song later so this is a literal virtuoso renaissance man with us here
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:36.080]  today and we'll talk about his new rap persona a bit later natural news calm of
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:40.320]  course and many other ventures but you've got several breaking news items
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:45.520]  first off we're gonna get into the fact that we're learning about some of the
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:51.560]  behind-the-scenes activity that's going on to manipulate vaccine data for the
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:57.680]  public and you also then have learned more about the KGB style operations that
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:02.920]  were used to go after rossum foods and now dairies and facilities all over the
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:07.680]  country where the new cocaine is milk is cheese is tomatoes they're actually
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:12.760]  grown and sold that aren't GMO yeah we have a number of issues to get into here
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:16.400]  Alex today let's start with the Institute of Medicine and the vaccine
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:21.160]  issue because Friday the Institute of Medicine the IOM released its report
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:26.920]  called vaccine adverse effects and this report documented some of the adverse
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:32.800]  effects of MMR vaccines and in this report the IOM admitted that MMR vaccines
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:38.320]  actually cause measles and they cause seizures and they cause anaphylactic
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:43.200]  shock and other vaccines cause skin lesions and live viral infections
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:46.280]  throughout the body and other things like that but the mainstream media
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:51.440]  predictably looked at this and said well we're just going to report this one
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:56.720]  headline that says the IOM declares vaccines don't cause autism and by the
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.760]  way this report is at infowars.com and naturalnews.com I'm scrabbling around
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:05.600]  looking for it here in my stack but we'll put that headline on screen here
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:10.360]  it is secret vaccine industry ties and military involvement with Institute of
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:13.960]  Medicine you have an old foot noted from their real reports but that's what
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:18.600]  we'll do it's like Monsanto with Searle in the 70s they admitted that the
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:21.880]  aspartame killed almost all the baby monkeys they gave it to in their
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:27.080]  mother's milk but they spun it and said oh three of the monkeys lived and so it
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:31.280]  means it's good right right there's total spin on this the old dinosaur media
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.440]  is completely spinning this story lying with the headlines but we did a
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:38.920]  complete breakdown of what the report actually says and reported that on
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:44.360]  Saturday which was also published on infowars.com and then we started to ask
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:48.280]  the questions who funds the Institute of Medicine where does the money come from
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:53.280]  does it have conflicts of interest now the answer is yes because this report
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:59.800]  which is about vaccines comes from the IOM which is funded get this Alex it is
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:06.600]  funded by Monsanto Pepsico McDonald's and all the major vaccine companies Merck
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:13.280]  Pfizer Eli Lilly Johnson and Johnson Wyeth AstraZeneca Sanofi Aventus all of
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:17.720]  these companies are giving money to the Institute of Medicine now why I think
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:21.560]  about the precedent though if they can set the precedent to make us take their
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:26.120]  products and try to mandate it and then run the hoax that it's the law and make
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:31.200]  us eat GMO and every and as the deaths mount and the disease mounts and as
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:34.560]  their own reports mount they just run around saying we're conspiracy theorist
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:38.800]  yeah and here's why this matters to your point more specifically remember when
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:43.720]  Obama recently announced that Medicare must cover birth control pills that had
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:47.280]  to be paid for by Medicare that was based on an Institute of Medicine
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.520]  recommendation so the IOM puts out these recommendations that then become
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:58.120]  public policy so the FDA turns to the IOM to make policy the CDC turns to the IOM
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:04.600]  to make policy about vaccines now after 9-eleven just a month later the IOM said
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:09.040]  that the attacks on 9-eleven prove that we need more vaccine production in
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.120]  America and it said we need to create something called the National Vaccine
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:18.240]  Authority the NVA and that comes out of bio shield that ten million dollar
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:22.480]  program with the level four bio weapons labs everywhere yeah exactly this is all
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.320]  tied into the military and we'll get into some of those ties more I mean the
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:29.640]  Institute of Medicine is funded in part by the Department of Defense funded by
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:33.400]  Department of Homeland Security even though it says on its website that it
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:37.880]  receives no funding directly from the government we uncovered proof and I've
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:41.200]  got the chart right here that shows it's actually two-thirds sixty four point nine
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:45.280]  percent of the funding comes from government organizations that then
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:49.040]  funnel this money into the Institute of Medicine they lied to us they would
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:52.000]  never do that well that's kind of like media matters saying we get no George
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:56.480]  Soros money but then you go to the chain he gives money to a foundation that then
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:59.440]  gives it to them right and then once it came out he just said all right here's
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:02.280]  millions directly to him that's what they're doing there they're shuffling
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:05.800]  this money around so tell me about this this chart here on the left the big pie
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:10.200]  chart on the left sixty four point nine percent is money from the government and
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:15.400]  the other third in the yellow on the far left is about one third comes from
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:19.320]  private industry Bill Gates and people Bill Gates gives money directly to the
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:23.840]  Institute of Medicine in fact Alex and your listeners will know why this is
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:28.800]  important this report on adverse effects of vaccines was allowed to be reviewed
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:33.040]  before publication to be reviewed by number one the Bill and Melinda Gates
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:40.600]  Foundation number two a military weapons defense contractor Northrop Grumman well
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:44.440]  they really care they've got something special they want us to take and they've
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:48.040]  already got us to the point of accepting the governor of Texas saying take a shot
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:52.560]  they know killed people in the trials yeah I mean these are this is eugenics
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:57.960]  this is the military trying to murder America and folks the military in
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:03.160]  thousands of tests has murdered our own troops knowingly they've shot kids up
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:08.760]  with syphilis and HIV and every other disease you can imagine they've been
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:13.400]  caught over and over again this is a fact and under martial law they will
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:18.200]  release the bio weapon they will give you then the binary vaccine generally with
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:22.720]  a triggered soft kill that kills you a decade down the road so that they can
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:26.080]  have plausible deniability just like the Pentagon in Vietnam wanted to have the
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:30.960]  enemy shot with a 223 round it would only wound them and then debilitate them
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:34.600]  this and then the military industrial complex itself is owned by the big
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:39.640]  megabanks and then they had big pharma in the hospitals they own and then when
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:42.800]  you go to their hospitals it's all actuaried out under government health
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:46.000]  care where the doctors can't even give you real health care the computer tells
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:50.680]  you what to do and then they suck all the money you've saved out of you with a
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:54.360]  bio weapon they hit you with so they hit you with a bio weapon then they have
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:58.440]  the treatment a perfect weapon where you then even extract the money and the
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:03.920]  resources out of someone this is the genius hey Bill pick up line three it's
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:09.120]  Brian hey Brian what's up thanks hey Bill I just received my shipment of the
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:13.720]  safety net our full-year emergency food system I can't tell you how great it
[02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:18.120]  feels to personally not have to worry anymore especially with the growing
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:24.240]  threats to our everyday food supply Brian not only are you getting 4,320
[02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:28.000]  nutritionally dense delicious food servings but the individual serving
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:33.200]  price is just $1.43 per meal it's truly great tasting food and amazing prices
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:38.320]  the variety is also a huge bonus bill it's like having access to a full menu of
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:41.640]  impressive food well it really is a safety net for those worried about the

[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:37.640]  okay Mike I've been jumping in here because it freaks me out so bad to know
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:42.400]  that you're doing the research along the lines we've done even deeper and to
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:47.340]  know that they even brag they roll out the diseases and then they have the
[02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:50.920]  treatments that another division develops and then the scientists developing
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:55.040]  that don't even know so this is such a cold-blooded way to not only kill you
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:25:00.200]  early but to extract all the wealth out of you so Mike please continue this is
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:04.920]  such a big deal that the PR group they claim is independent is Department of
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:08.400]  Defense Bella Melinda Gates well as a great example of what you're just
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:11.280]  talking about there remember the Institute of Medicine was created by
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:16.560]  Congress in 1970 but it's a nonprofit it's sort of it has become the go-to
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:22.040]  authority for any time the president or the CDC or the FDA yeah I'm an independent
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:26.280]  something I'm an independent yeah yeah well they claim to be independent but
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:29.520]  of course where do we use their money come from government but some of the
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:34.760]  ties in here are through throughout the IOM are quite incestuous for example one
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:40.560]  of the more prominent members of the IOM is a board of director of PepsiCo he
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:43.880]  also sits on the boards of two pharmaceutical companies and one
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:47.480]  medical device manufacturer named Medtronic which of course has been
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:52.960]  sued by 22 states for committing alleged fraud now one of the pharmaceutical
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:58.280]  companies that this man sits on the board of it develops pharmaceuticals to
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:02.840]  treat kidney disease well kidney disease is one of the most common side effects
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:07.560]  of taking vaccines and we've established this through many interviews before with
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:11.600]  kidney experts dialysis experts tell us this so if you look at how this is all
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:16.640]  connected Alex you've got vaccines that cause diseases like kidney disease like
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:21.400]  autism like neurological problems and then people go to the hospital to get
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:24.200]  treated for those disease they end up taking the drugs made by the drug
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:28.960]  companies which are run by the board director members who are also members of
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:34.440]  the IOM that's just one example of the this the circle this racket that goes
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:40.200]  on behind the scenes please continue with your report sure well on the defense
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:44.120]  side on the military side and by the way I see vaccines as being really
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:47.800]  militarized here in the next year or two I think we're looking at a situation
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:53.600]  remember when Baxter Pharmaceuticals got caught shipping live viruses in its
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:58.360]  vaccine samples that was about what 18 months ago or so now we have the
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:02.560]  Institute of Medicine admitting that some vaccines cause live virus infections
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:06.280]  throughout the body I think we're looking at a situation here in the very
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:12.200]  near near future where a pandemic will be caused by the vaccine industry they're
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:16.880]  going to put live viruses in the vaccines cause the pandemic and then cite
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:21.920]  the Institute of Medicine's safety report as the reason to push for national
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:26.040]  mandatory vaccines which will be enforced by Department of Homeland
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:30.120]  Security well we know under the model state self-emergency powers act they
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:33.960]  tried to get forced inoculation through but it failed because the first
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:37.480]  responders wouldn't be inoculated to then be the enforcer so they said well
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:41.960]  you can make people take shots but you don't have to and we know in the H1N1
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:46.400]  it came out they put a quote marker virus in vaccines the year before that
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:53.000]  was the H1N1 so any big vaccine they push that they're really behind that's
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.880]  the special vaccine that's had the other things added and they've done for
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:00.960]  decades Crohn's didn't exist 50 years ago now it's like getting the cold
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:06.680]  everybody's got it they they've gone in and the gut proven measles vaccines so
[02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:11.520]  and Bill and Linda Gates the forefront in studying diseases of the gut and then
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:15.840]  treatments I mean these people got it all figured out and there's more on this
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:20.160]  on the military side to Northrop Grumman who again was allowed to review this
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:25.840]  report by the IOM this is the global military defense contractor that was
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:30.240]  caught by the State Department in the 1980s selling computer code off of Air
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:34.720]  Force One to the Russians this company has been found by the State Department to
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:39.360]  be engaged in illegal international arms trafficking violation of all State
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:44.480]  Department rules regarding the exporting of computer code missile guidance
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:50.200]  systems technologies for example many other examples of that this company was
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:55.120]  given a prominent role in a five billion dollar grant by the CDC to develop a
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:29:01.920]  vaccine tracking information technology system and in that grant Northrop Grumman
[02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:06.200]  bragged in a press release that it was going to use its cyber security
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:10.880]  technology to innovate new systems I'm paraphrasing obviously but to innovate
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:15.520]  new systems to track the spread of infectious disease and to develop more
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:20.920]  aggressive inoculation or vaccination technologies well what they've said I
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:24.560]  remember that coming out a few months ago that they're going to come out with
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:27.560]  the new tracking systems where you've got to have your shots to be able to go
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:33.080]  out and do anything so the the forcing the public to do this stay there let's
[02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:37.880]  continue with this groundbreaking research and then we're going to get into
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:43.400]  the KGB tactics as they try to shut down the grass roots shale of lemonade

[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:01.160]  end up probably putting more information in 30 minutes than we do in three
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:05.320]  hours because I've seen the special reports we've done that are really a
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:09.120]  beta test for the nightly news we're still gonna have the special reports as
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:14.080]  well and people love them and they're informative and it makes me be focused

[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:43.320]  like an intelligence briefing this is all about the explosion of the alternative

[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:17.400]  reports we posted on my YouTube channel my wife and family who are normally
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:19.760]  critical because I ask them to be critical they're like no this is
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:23.480]  incredible that this is really good and Mike Adams has agreed sometimes you'll
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:28.920]  be a fill-in host on the nightly news Aaron Dykes we've got a Darren McBreen
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:33.120]  here great reporter work for big national outfits and if we get more
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:37.120]  members and if we're able to pay for it right now there's no sponsors so we
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:40.840]  haven't even sold sponsors yes me a few sponsors we'll be able to really start
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:44.880]  building and let me give you a news flash we're gonna start having health
[02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:50.560]  shows we're gonna start having firearms second amendment programs national
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:56.360]  sovereignty intelligence reports I intend if this takes off to bring in whole
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:00.760]  teams of people and it's not just gonna be prison planet TV anymore it's gonna
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:05.640]  be a springboard on to television okay I could already be on television but it's
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:08.840]  this little network this cable system that's great we're gonna be on those
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:11.840]  within just a few months because they're out there they want them I've got to have
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:16.560]  the deployment system where it's fiber optically sent up to these hubs I've
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:19.920]  got to pay for the tens of thousands of dollars of equipment on that we're just
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:25.160]  getting it launched but you're gonna see more more more more more and again
[02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:28.680]  we're stepping up here the fact that we've had such a big effect is the
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:32.600]  reason I'm doing this now Mike Adams again people like Mike Adams with
[02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:38.880]  hardcore key news in here with us this this platform is about empowering them
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:43.360]  as well that's what natural news does is empowers millions of other people
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:46.800]  around the world and that there's not many things that are similar to info
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:51.040]  wars but natural news is certainly something that you know a lot of ways
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:54.760]  is doing the same thing and even surpassing us Mike and that's a good
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:59.280]  feeling because I'm not in competition with people I wish there were 5,000 Mike
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:03.240]  Adams and 5,000 Alex Joneses yeah I feel exactly the same way about it that's
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:06.960]  why that's why I love to fill in for you whenever I'm asked and I wrote this
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:10.320]  article about you about it about a week ago I don't know if you saw it but I
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:13.800]  even said in the article look I never asked for compensation or anything like
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:17.760]  that this is about patriots you know banding together to put the truth out
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:21.640]  there there's no competition it's total cooperation about informing people
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:24.600]  educating people when we cover more health and food freedom they're
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:29.480]  murdering people knowingly these are cold-blooded hitlers exactly exactly we
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:33.240]  all got to rise up and just play a role in this whenever we are called to play
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:36.800]  a role we got to jump on that and that's why you're getting into music let me
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:42.000]  tell you're talented my wife likes that genre of kind of pop rap and and other
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.160]  people in the office and they say that's that's good I mean I know that most of
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:48.960]  the tortures my ears you know the the kind of pop stuff I like some of the
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:53.520]  you know old-school stuff but yours I actually enjoyed it hey thanks man
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:56.280]  thanks well we have a couple more songs coming out and it has a very positive
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:01.680]  message that that's a real positive song I I wrote the words to that really a
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:06.880]  year ago before things got darker there I think if I were to write it now it
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:10.560]  might be a little a little more edgy but nevertheless I know you want to get
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:15.120]  into the FDA and its KGB tactics but is that what you want to go yeah but first
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:20.920]  tell us about the new rap icon oh well I new character oh man okay well I I
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:28.280]  launched an artist label an artist name Amethios and that's Amethios.com and is
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:33.600]  that Greek well it's sort of supposed to sound Greekish but the the truth is to
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:40.200]  me Amé from the Latin root means love and compassion and and Theos is
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:45.360]  indicative of theology or spirituality or or higher power so the the religion of
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:48.440]  love really that's really what it comes down to and actually if you think about
[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:52.280]  it Alex most of what we do here in sort of the patriot movement or the
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:56.480]  alternative media is about compassion we're trying to save people's lives
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:00.920]  we're trying to awaken people to a we're actually like wow they're putting
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:04.680]  radioactive isotopes in the water not just fluoride I'm angry about this I
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:09.760]  want to warn other people you know I call us the normal movement it's normal to
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:14.840]  be concerned exactly exactly some you know a lot of some of the crazy critics
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:20.000]  think that we do this out of out of fear or hate not at all we do this out of
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:25.280]  compassion because we want to help our fellow human beings survive and be
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:29.360]  informed and be aware and be prepared and be able to defend themselves and
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:33.360]  their families grow their own food stand up for their liberties that that comes
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:37.320]  out of love ultimately Alex and I I know that word maybe isn't tossed around
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:41.400]  here a lot well it's all kind of but it's ultimately that's what it comes down
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:44.820]  to we love our fellow human beings we love freedom we love liberty and we're
[02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:49.040]  willing to fight for it and and sing for it and rap for it you know I love it
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:56.040]  no it's pure genius so give us the Amethios website well AMETTHIOS.com
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:02.040]  or go to naturalnews.com okay just finishing up the last story that you've
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:07.800]  got this government-created group that operates as independent and claims it
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:12.040]  only gets private funding a perfect non-governmental organization and then
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:17.880]  it turns out 64.9% Department of Defense but Bill and Melinda Gates which might
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.680]  as well be government creepily going around lying because they they've got a
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:26.800]  problem they wanted to kill us with the vaccines and do all this and give us
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:32.440]  degenerative diseases which they profit from but now it's coming out as you
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:36.280]  mentioned that it's that these vaccines are totally screwing people up well
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:39.200]  to remember that this Institute of Medicine this is the same group Alex
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:44.280]  that gave the recent vitamin D deficiency recommendations and warned we
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:48.680]  shouldn't take too much vitamin D said Americans should only have about 600 I
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:53.160]  use of vitamin D I take 10,000 a day thousands of scientists saying you're
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:57.200]  not gonna get these internal cancers cut in half all this stuff and they come
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:00.560]  out and say don't do it don't do it because they know the Sun despite all
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:04.040]  these poisons and I'm pretty unhealthy I'm go out and lay out for 30 minutes
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:08.480]  and feel rejuvenated they're like no be cave dwellers like us the Sun is evil
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:12.200]  it's with al-Qaeda yeah it's incredible this is a whole fascinating history in
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:15.800]  fact this the IOM went remember last year when the experiments on the
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:20.240]  Guatemalan prisoners came out the the illegal medical experiments funded by
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:24.040]  the US government and the NIH what level putting a loving civilism that's
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:28.640]  exactly what it was and Obama said oh we have to appoint an investigative
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:32.320]  commission to look into this and he turned to the IOM and said we want you
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:36.240]  to investigate very guys doing it the IOM had to recuse themselves because some
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:40.440]  of their members apparently had ties or weren't of course in these medical
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:45.160]  experiments like an investigation going right now the investigation is found we
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:48.320]  should fund these groups even more to make sure this doesn't happen in the
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:51.880]  future they'll actually do that they'll say we need more funding because FEMA
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:55.880]  confiscated guns in New Orleans well that's the FDA's line we need more
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:59.320]  funding because the food is dangerous even though they're the ones making the
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:03.400]  food dangerous you know they're the ones who look the other way when Cargill
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:07.720]  brought in ground turkey was distributing ground turkey contaminated with
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:12.560]  Salmonella all across the country both the USDA and the FDA look the other way
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:17.360]  did you know right now today in terms of chickens sold in grocery stores two
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:22.520]  thirds of it is routinely contaminated with Salmonella every single day you
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:25.920]  don't hear a word about that all you hear is about how dangerous the raw milk
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:31.400]  is which isn't even dangerous at all they've written regulations to legalize
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:36.040]  vaccines killing people well the vaccine damage fund law says we can because
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:39.200]  it's government mandated that the government said so oh we're allowed to
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:43.440]  sell you rotten beef rotten pork rotten chicken because we radiate it now
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:47.720]  because the government said we're allowed to oh the government says Walmart
[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:53.240]  can inject water into their food yeah right that's why I love being in Texas
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:57.440]  by the way because you go out to the farmers markets and I go out and I
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:44:03.320]  there's a local producer of free-range beef and I buy these beef bones that's
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:08.760]  al-Qaeda al-Qaeda meetings and and we raise chickens now we're getting eggs
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:13.320]  every day so we're eating our own chicken eggs that are produced right on
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:17.880]  our own farm and it's beautiful and I can't I keep wondering when is the FDA
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:22.480]  gonna come raid my little I saw an article a few days ago or even in
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:26.000]  cities where they have laws that you can have chickens there's their rating
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.880]  people and in finding them now yeah well it clearly it's very criminal
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:36.560]  activity but FDA spies we got to get into that yeah go ahead take it away the
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:41.440]  alright so we had after the raw some food raids which of course the SWAT
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:48.600]  style armed FDA led raids on these raw dairy producers in Venice California after
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:53.040]  that happened we had three informants approach us with information about the
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:58.760]  FDA creating a spy network of infiltrators who are infiltrating the
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:02.480]  raw dairy movement they've been right here in Austin nobody's hiding it it's
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:06.000]  totally legal and there's these weird creeps creeping around well yeah they're
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.720]  trained by the FDA and the FDA trains them in social engineering techniques and
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:13.720]  KGB style techniques and it turns out that most of them are women by the way
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:18.600]  because women can go in and give a story of I have a child that I can't breastfeed
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:22.800]  that's why I need raw goats milk to keep my baby alive they did that with the
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:26.240]  Amish and they'll even beg until they agree to sell them well right right only
[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:31.640]  sellers to my neighbors please sir please I want a SWAT team you so bad that's it
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:35.640]  and they'll name drop they'll say oh I talked to farmer Joe over here and he
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:39.720]  said I should talk to you because you're the inside source for raw goats milk to
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:44.840]  keep my baby alive but it's all a lie these are all FDA infiltrators and spies
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:50.360]  who are setting up these farmers for entrapment to be raided and of course
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:54.040]  the FDA pushing death and destruction now anything wholesome and good is bad
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:46:00.800]  well the sunlight is evil yeah evil Cass Sunstein said they should pass a law
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:06.440]  to arrest people that say sunlight's good for you what did he attack sunlight 911
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:09.840]  truth and people that don't believe in man-made global warming look we had an
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:15.720]  informant that told us the FDA sent armed men to their house or at least men
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:19.160]  dressed in government uniforms that they assumed who looked armed I don't know if
[02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:23.360]  they wielded guns in their face or anything but the men threatened this
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:28.360]  farmer said you don't sell raw dairy and if you go public with us showing up at
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:32.440]  your house and verbally intimidating you we're going to declare your dairy herd
[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:36.240]  to be infected with mad cow disease and have them all destroyed oh he should go
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:40.720]  public that is this is the terrorist saying they'll frame you just like we
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:44.000]  have New York cops going you're not allowed to protest but we have a permit
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:48.080]  we're going to take you to jail your camera is a gun and the cops frame them
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:52.520]  and give them the camera because they're they're superiors love frame us yeah
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:56.880]  that I mean this this is pure evil and and for those who don't believe this by
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:00.040]  the way there's a movie coming out called pharma get in this is the
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:05.060]  documentary about some of these rays and and the website is pharma get in movie
[02:47:05.060 --> 02:47:08.400]  commons coming out I want to get them on it's being previewed I think in
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:12.000]  Chicago in a couple of days but it's still in theaters you can watch the
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:15.040]  trailer who's putting that out I'm gonna get them on you know there it's a
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:20.160]  woman named Kimberly no Kristen I'm sorry Kristen I can get you her phone
[02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:23.400]  numbers yeah because we might want to carry that in the store but this movie
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.960]  documents a case where the feds came into a sheep farm and declared that all
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:33.000]  the sheep were contaminated with mad cow disease and literally stole the sheep
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:36.520]  took them away and had them all cremated well it turns out that's what
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:40.280]  they did in England it came out in the news the government accidentally
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:43.720]  released weaponized foot and mouth remember in 2000 I remember and then
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:48.200]  killed almost the entire sheep and cow herd except for big agra yeah they
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:52.800]  literally destroyed everybody and then wouldn't let people set back up is that
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:56.920]  not genius well it's incredible but it shows you the lengths they'll go to I
[02:47:56.920 --> 02:48:02.880]  mean these are our animal murderers for one for one thing but they're also human
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:07.520]  murderers in the sense that they would go in and raid the raw food outfits to
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:11.440]  deny children their nutrition a lot of parents were buying the raw milk but then
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:19.160]  lie but then lie and say we are you know we know your your sheep don't have mad
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:24.480]  mad cow right sheep we're just gonna say it yes it shows how they use the
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:28.440]  threat of contagion as their total excuse and what we're seeing is a
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:35.280]  militarization of the FDA which extends to the IOM and the military ties that we
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:38.000]  sort of touched on the Department of Education without Lawrence is now
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.480]  kicking down doors yeah and and I understand tomorrow you're gonna have the
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:46.280]  CEO of Gibson guitars yes they were raided by the feds for what illegal
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.520]  would now do you do you realize where they could go with this if the wood in
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:54.160]  your guitar is illegal they could say the wood stock on your firearm is
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:58.800]  illegal no no no they admit that they said no no no yeah that's why I wanted
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:01.160]  to cover this over the weekend and I never did because I got busy on other
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:05.000]  subjects it was even the Wall Street Journal and other articles that now
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:10.760]  they're gonna go back to even hundred year old guitars pianas guns incredible
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:14.960]  and if it's from any of these countries now even if it ain't no no no no you're
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:18.800]  going to be SWAT team so exactly the government isn't enough to make drugs
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:22.600]  illegal and then come after people for drugs they bring in now it's gonna be
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:27.000]  light bulbs at which they're now coming after folks for the wrong kind of power
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.280]  the wrong kind of washing machine wood and they're admitting they're now
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:35.600]  raiding people over guitars that are even 60 years old and when you try to
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:39.880]  fly out of the country with them if you can't prove no matter what it is where
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:46.520]  the wood came from they're taking it it's a total authoritarianism I'm sure
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:49.400]  this is another reason for them to try to arrest Willie Nelson by the way they
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:52.920]  go after his guitars now but do you realize where they could extend this
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:55.880]  what's the name of his guitar trigger the one he's had so long actually touch
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:59.640]  trigger really his head since he was a kid well that's it for that thing an
[02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:04.080]  al-qaeda instrument trigger up there that he bought in Texas like 65 years ago
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:09.360]  I think it's about 11 when he got it so I guess it was like 70 years ago he's
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:14.560]  like 76 but look if they can outlaw materials now they could say well the
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:19.920]  the gallium in your solar panels is illegal from China so all gallium is
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:23.400]  illegal and they could confiscate all solar panel no no that's the new system
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:27.680]  the green police are there to make sure you get this phenol a they're there to
[02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:31.040]  make sure you don't get your vitamins I mean I'm checked it they're going after
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:34.920]  everything that doesn't matter while ignoring the GMO yeah well that's
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:39.640]  exactly right right GMOs are genetically contaminating our world so
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:43.680]  suicides of farmers aren't record levels throughout India and I think we're
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:48.000]  going to see more of farmer suicides in the US maybe even in Texas because the
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:52.360]  drought combined with GMO failures is just driving people to real misery you
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:56.720]  know what Mike Adams we're going into overdrive I've got a bunch of meetings

[02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:45.400]  comes in here will will will throw him in front of the microphone he's a great
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:48.800]  great radio talk show host but for the official show that ends in about five
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:54.240]  minutes I'll be back tomorrow obviously 11 a.m. central standard time we got
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:57.120]  Ron Paul coming up on Wednesday and a bunch of other big guests throughout the
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:02.600]  week and we're also getting some of the people on from Gibson as well to talk
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:06.240]  about their rate and by the way the government already rated them two years
[02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:16.080]  ago and had to admit had to admit that had to admit that they had already
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:21.480]  rated them before and that they had been not guilty of that and they're buying
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:28.720]  the certified wood but but it's about wood instead of where Kim trailing you
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:34.400]  we're modifying the crops we're splicing all these animals together they
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:38.360]  really don't have any justification Alex to raid them this this is what the US
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:42.880]  is turning into the federal regulators are now just they're just rating you as
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:48.000]  a nuisance tactic they have no law on their side and a law has been thrown out
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:52.240]  even even that throughout the executive branch it's a bunch of control freak
[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:56.240]  parasites who who act like complete crap that's when you wake up to corruption
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:56:00.240]  is when the cops are saying we're gonna frame you and stuff yeah like wow you're
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:04.080]  really a criminal yeah the government's really criminal hey people are waking up
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:07.200]  all over the place now I mean the raw dairy thing woke up a lot of people in
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:10.680]  California who really weren't paying attention to the coming police state
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:14.760]  until this happened now Gibson guitar raid this is waking up a lot of people
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:19.800]  throughout the music in thousands of lemonade stands and even Forbes had to
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.760]  admit this is about cracking down on grassroots activity making you go to big
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:28.040]  box stores they don't want humans doing normal human activities right well I
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:33.720]  can't wait for them to outlaw rock and roll to start raiding record stores for
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:37.960]  no reason because I don't know the this BPA in the vinyl or something and you
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:41.480]  know who knows what they'll come up with is this some crazy it's all about
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:46.000]  power grabs there's a training us to accept bizarre behavior well that's
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:49.400]  what it is and and as long as they keep doing this they're actually sort of
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:55.440]  working for us because they're creating the reaction as you say for every
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:58.400]  action there's an equal and opposite reaction every time they conduct an
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:04.400]  unjustified illegal raid they wake up another sector of society that says
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:08.560]  wait a minute this is not a free country anymore anymore and we must take a
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:12.480]  stand and fight for our liberties we're gonna lose them I saw the Atlantic
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:16.200]  could be a big liberal publication saying oh my gosh how do you make
[02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:20.720]  musicians tea partiers you know take their guitars and they said the whole
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:24.360]  internet's on fire thousands of musician sides are totally angry and don't
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:29.480]  believe in our global warming takeover we've got to be nicer again they don't
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:33.000]  want to move their green police too quick it's like yeah will micromanage
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:37.760]  everybody later first just start taxing their fuel let us let's let's let's get
[02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:41.240]  the horse in the back of the trailer don't let them know we're taking them to
[02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:44.880]  a glue factory but it is like they're in a hurry now they they seem to be
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:49.800]  accelerating and escalating these raids and the attempts to outlaw dietary
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:52.720]  supplements which by the way the Institute of Medicine has been in
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:56.360]  favor of for a long time actually issued a position paper on that we've got a big
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:58:00.520]  call-in day coming up September 8th a nationwide call-in day to complain about
[02:58:00.520 --> 02:58:04.600]  the FDA's attempt to outlaw dietary supplements we covered here on your show
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:10.000]  weeks ago that issue is still out there they're gonna keep trying to outlaw our
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:15.120]  music instruments our food our supplements who knows what else they're
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:18.480]  gonna go after Alex and firearms of course that's that goes without saying
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:23.520]  but you know what else is on their target list next well after everything is
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:26.880]  and you know they've got a ship guns into Mexico to blame it on the Second
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:31.640]  Amendment they're going to do it that's it for the official transmission we're
[02:58:31.640 --> 02:58:36.400]  gonna be back in one minute and it'll be riding shotgun no longer he'll be in
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:43.440]  the catbird seat here straight ahead Mike Adams coming up thank you for
[02:58:43.440 --> 02:58:50.520]  listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:56.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:58:56.920 --> 02:59:02.440]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[02:59:02.440 --> 02:59:06.200]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've termed members
[02:59:06.200 --> 02:59:11.240]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:16.600]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:21.520]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:59:21.520 --> 02:59:25.920]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:59:25.920 --> 02:59:29.640]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[02:59:29.640 --> 02:59:33.600]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:59:33.600 --> 02:59:39.240]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:45.280]  Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're

[03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:39.240]  that I really admire I mean it's a very short list it's people like Thomas
[03:02:39.240 --> 03:02:44.680]  Jefferson it's people like Ron Paul people like Samuel Adams who I'm just
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:49.800]  lucky enough to share the last name with there but in terms of people operating
[03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:54.640]  today and actually active people out there in the world there's those who I
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:59.000]  admire it's a very short list Paul Craig Roberts definitely on the list but
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:04.640]  it's not a huge list Alex Jones is someone I truly and honestly admire for
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:09.480]  his courage and that's what I laid out in that story which has been very widely
[03:03:09.480 --> 03:03:15.240]  read and and very popular actually because you got to understand that people
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:20.440]  like Alex and to some extent myself we would really rather be out fishing
[03:03:20.440 --> 03:03:25.120]  somewhere or or having free time or maybe even exercising on a treadmill I
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:29.080]  mean I've I've actually lost some of my exercise time because I'm working so hard
[03:03:29.080 --> 03:03:32.920]  on natural news and I've seen pictures of Alex Jones when he was pumping weights
[03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:37.640]  and super buff and you know he's he's put a lot of time into this and he hasn't
[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:40.760]  had time to go do the personal exercise that I know he enjoys doing that he
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:45.040]  wants to do because he's sacrificing his time to be here to do this show and I
[03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:49.720]  understand that because this is what patriots do committed people this is
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:54.000]  what they do because they are dedicated to spending their time making a
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:59.560]  difference in this world for your future even if it means sacrificing some of
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:04.760]  their own time even time with family sometimes or a personal time time off
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:08.680]  you don't see Alex taking time off I don't take time off either I just spent
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:12.760]  the weekend working on this Institute of Medicine report but that's why I'm here
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:17.360]  I just want to be on the record of why I'm here why I'm I'm really just humbled
[03:04:17.360 --> 03:04:21.120]  and and happy to be part of this organization and I know you understand

[03:08:32.320 --> 03:08:37.920]  would you happen to be listening to the show a couple weeks ago when Alex had
[03:08:37.920 --> 03:08:43.480]  the farmers call in yes I was this I listen to that show yes okay I'm the
[03:08:43.480 --> 03:08:46.920]  guy that called it was talking about the black helicopter oh I remember yeah
[03:08:46.920 --> 03:08:50.800]  remember your call yeah you you you said that you they were so close that you
[03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:55.560]  flipped them off and they flipped you back off as well right that was you yes
[03:08:55.560 --> 03:09:03.840]  okay I don't believe in coincidence in the very next Friday at 10 minutes till
[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:08.840]  11 right before Alex show come on I was getting ready to go on a camping trip and
[03:09:08.840 --> 03:09:13.880]  me and a friend of mine was walking down the lane to feed my horses and guess
[03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:20.120]  what I heard the helicopter coming in I turned around immediately and started
[03:09:20.120 --> 03:09:26.320]  back to the house and my friend didn't know what was going on and he's away
[03:09:26.320 --> 03:09:30.200]  we're going back to the house and I said well I'm going to get my rifle and I
[03:09:30.200 --> 03:09:36.440]  went and I just ended up against the tree and the black a black helicopter came
[03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:42.200]  right back and he flew over two or three times and you could tell they was
[03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:47.160]  trying to see who was who's there so far I said heck with it and you know and I
[03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:52.840]  just walk on down the feed the horses and they hovered right on top of us so
[03:09:52.840 --> 03:09:57.320]  is this you think them saying we're watching you we are listening to you
[03:09:57.320 --> 03:10:01.200]  and we want you to know that or what what's your interpretation of it that's
[03:10:01.200 --> 03:10:08.560]  my interpretation but my friend I told him to take out his phone and take
[03:10:08.560 --> 03:10:11.600]  pictures every time you take a picture they fly off and then they come back
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:19.040]  but the gesture was he I wouldn't look up at him and he told me he said they
[03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:25.000]  have a camera sure yeah and what they was want me to do is look up and I
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:30.320]  wouldn't do it okay well where where your boonie there Roger and don't let him
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:33.080]  get a face shot of you but I would advise you to get yourself a high-powered
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:36.760]  camera get some shots of them if you hold the camera in front of your face
[03:10:36.760 --> 03:10:41.560]  they can't get a clear picture of your face get some photos of them and send
[03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:46.560]  them here to Info Wars well I'm gonna try to if I could figure out how to do
[03:10:46.560 --> 03:10:49.920]  this download those pictures from his phone them to my computer and send it
[03:10:49.920 --> 03:10:56.280]  send it to you guys but I just want everybody to know is in YouTube they're
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:11:02.440]  listening to this show of course they are yeah they knew I was the one that
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:05.680]  called in and they want to come back and say hey you're not getting away with
[03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:09.000]  any fun well Roger this this goes for you and everybody else out there we need
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:12.520]  more people with cameras and video cameras and high-powered cameras not
[03:11:12.520 --> 03:11:17.040]  just the iPhone cell phone cameras those aren't really high resolution folks get
[03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:23.200]  more cameras going and you can get more proof and more footage that Info Wars
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:27.120]  will share and air and that's crucial for all of us to remember you know
[03:11:27.120 --> 03:11:30.760]  photographic evidence is one of the ways that we can really defend ourselves
[03:11:30.760 --> 03:11:35.520]  against this kind of what sounds like an intimidation tactic and Roger I
[03:11:35.520 --> 03:11:38.840]  appreciate your call it's it's great to get an update from you want to go to a
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:43.040]  Zachary in California has been on hold for a while Zachary how are you today

[03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:54.640]  Vilca bomba and but you already left like Texas but yeah everyone's talking
[03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:58.440]  about you down there all right great glad to know you're getting getting that
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:02.120]  get around there so I want to make it real quick though for the other cars I
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:05.480]  don't know if there's any cars after me but there's a that you were you on the
[03:12:05.480 --> 03:12:09.320]  phone were you there with Alex when you guys were talking about the secret space
[03:12:09.320 --> 03:12:14.680]  program no I was not here in studio no okay well he Alex even had his dad come
[03:12:14.680 --> 03:12:19.560]  in and he had him talk about being in Montana and seeing things up in the sky
[03:12:19.560 --> 03:12:23.080]  like satellites but things that would go 90 degree angles as some guy talked called
[03:12:23.080 --> 03:12:26.840]  in said he worked at area 52 and he was talking about Star Trek technology
[03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:31.320]  anyway I think I'll see that a whole show on the secret space program anyway
[03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:33.760]  there's something called project Camelot and they have a lot of whistleblowers
[03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:36.560]  that come out and we actually saw them down there in Ecuador they had a
[03:12:36.560 --> 03:12:39.840]  conference anyway project Camelot has these whistleblowers come out and it's
[03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:42.880]  very important information that what they're gonna love this stuff like there
[03:12:42.880 --> 03:12:48.160]  are moon and Mars colonies with 500,000 people on them on the Mars James I yeah
[03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:52.720]  I hear you James I just you know Alex normally doesn't focus on what what he
[03:12:52.720 --> 03:12:57.120]  calls little green men type of type of stories although I know he did cover the
[03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:01.840]  spaceplane technology and some secret military technology that's out there
[03:13:01.840 --> 03:13:05.160]  it's just you know obviously that's his choice of what he wants to cover I'm
[03:13:05.160 --> 03:13:08.800]  just I'm just telling you up front he normally likes to focus on the more
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:16.240]  earth like you know grounded politics type of issues but what what he what what's
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:20.080]  the number one thing you think that the producers here need to look for to cover
[03:13:20.080 --> 03:13:22.560]  the stories you're talking about what should they what should they follow up
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:27.760]  on my back on yeah you're on okay well I just have a little card here I just
[03:13:27.760 --> 03:13:31.840]  want to kind of please just just just say these things okay we were on the
[03:13:31.840 --> 03:13:34.680]  ground and we get these military night vision I go out with Ed Grimbley he's
[03:13:34.680 --> 03:13:37.600]  been on coast to coast and we see these things up in the air now this is very
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:40.880]  important this is the most important issue that we have because this is the
[03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:44.440]  greater picture now basically these crafts are up in the mountains they go
[03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:47.320]  have 90 degree turns that the secret government has these reservations
[03:13:47.320 --> 03:13:50.920]  apparently you know Alex had Buzz Aldrin come on the show and talk about the
[03:13:50.920 --> 03:13:54.040]  monolith on Phobos and Alex even mentioned how science acknowledges
[03:13:54.040 --> 03:13:57.880]  there's at least 12 dimensions stacked up now the now they think about like past
[03:13:57.880 --> 03:14:01.920]  lives the extraterrestrials your soul and God they're also eat it deeply
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:05.320]  deeply intertwined Alex mentioned stern opening up wormholes to channel
[03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:08.720]  interdimensional yeah he covers all this we're talking about and the ETS are
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:11.360]  responsible for the eugenics the abductions the whole great thing now
[03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:14.280]  the whole great man thing you can make fun of it all you want but this is all
[03:14:14.280 --> 03:14:17.080]  this important issue we have the Anunnaki and the Nephilim
[03:14:17.080 --> 03:14:21.240]  I hear you Zachary I I hear you man I'm really I'm glad you're sharing this
[03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:25.880]  information I just some of this you got to get some footage and send in the
[03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:31.800]  footage I mean some of it is is such it's very difficult for people to latch
[03:14:31.800 --> 03:14:37.680]  on to unless there's more photographic evidence or leaked papers from ex-military
[03:14:37.680 --> 03:14:40.840]  files and things like that so if you can get some of that stuff I know the
[03:14:40.840 --> 03:14:44.240]  Info Wars producers will take a look at that I appreciate your call Zachary
[03:14:44.240 --> 03:14:49.640]  thanks for calling in let's go to wow the color screens blank here let's go to

[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:44.120]  all this bad things going on it's just it's getting ridiculous well listen up
[03:15:44.120 --> 03:15:48.080]  you know in this slave nation police state you're not allowed to invoke the
[03:15:48.080 --> 03:15:53.080]  Constitution anymore especially not in a court a courtroom scenario so he's
[03:15:53.080 --> 03:15:56.520]  probably a little ticked off that you think you have rights how dare you think
[03:15:56.520 --> 03:16:02.800]  you have rights now about about learning Chinese in kindergarten first of all I
[03:16:02.800 --> 03:16:05.880]  don't know how much Chinese a kindergartner can even learn I mean I it
[03:16:05.880 --> 03:16:11.440]  took me years to speak some of that language as an adult and I'm still not
[03:16:11.440 --> 03:16:16.320]  totally fluent in it but you know Chinese is obviously a useful language to
[03:16:16.320 --> 03:16:21.720]  know in terms of what's happening with our world but I agree with you that no
[03:16:21.720 --> 03:16:27.000]  one should be forced to learn Chinese or Spanish or any other languages should
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:30.720]  always be a choice and it should be up to the parents and not the school system
[03:16:30.720 --> 03:16:33.800]  shoving these issues down the throats of these children is there anything else
[03:16:33.800 --> 03:16:38.000]  you wanted to add to that James well it's just I can't believe how our
[03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:42.080]  sheriffs are trying to beat bullies to us because we're bringing up the
[03:16:42.080 --> 03:16:45.960]  Constitution they're sworn to protect the Constitution you know most I'm going
[03:16:45.960 --> 03:16:50.160]  to be most of the time sheriffs are actually you know like Sheriff Mack who's
[03:16:50.160 --> 03:16:55.520]  been on this show sheriffs by and large tend to be the good guys so you must have
[03:16:55.520 --> 03:16:59.720]  run into a bad apple out there who just is on a power trip or an ego trip or
[03:16:59.720 --> 03:17:03.720]  something like that James yeah you're right that's what he was too because he
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:07.400]  called back up and got out his car and got all loud with me and threatened to
[03:17:07.400 --> 03:17:12.240]  arrest me and it's just getting terrible nowadays yeah well you're right on I
[03:17:12.240 --> 03:17:15.760]  appreciate your call thanks for sharing that with us and folks remember do
[03:17:15.760 --> 03:17:19.720]  firmly stand up for your rights but don't escalate situations with sheriffs
[03:17:19.720 --> 03:17:25.840]  or even police because they are trained to fight escalation with more violence
[03:17:25.840 --> 03:17:30.880]  on on their side so stay calm stay chill state your rights know your rights and
[03:17:30.880 --> 03:17:34.960]  stand firm in your belief that you are protected by the bill of rights and
[03:17:34.960 --> 03:17:38.160]  you'll have more leverage in those kinds of encounters but thanks for your call
[03:17:38.160 --> 03:17:42.360]  now Richard in Indiana just thanks for joining us but want to warn you we're
[03:17:42.360 --> 03:17:45.720]  about to go to a break but very quickly Richard what's on your mind and how can
[03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:49.760]  we help you hi Mike it's a pleasure I wanted to ask what you mentioned earlier
[03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:53.320]  in the broadcast about forced inoculations and I believe that too
[03:17:53.320 --> 03:17:57.560]  will come to pass when that happens how do you think this will play out when
[03:17:57.560 --> 03:18:02.080]  people such as myself that's on retirement and it goes as far as
[03:18:02.080 --> 03:18:06.560]  shutting your social security check off your bank down how do you think it'll
[03:18:06.560 --> 03:18:11.880]  play out when there's millions of us who are informed and will say no where where
[03:18:11.880 --> 03:18:15.640]  do you think this will go well what could well that that's a really good
[03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:19.320]  question Richard I was actually pondering that as I drove here today to
[03:18:19.320 --> 03:18:24.360]  be on the show and the first thing I realized is you have to be able to
[03:18:24.360 --> 03:18:28.360]  track people so they have to have a tracking technology in place now whether
[03:18:28.360 --> 03:18:32.720]  that's an RFID chip which they're calling now electronic tattoos or whether
[03:18:32.720 --> 03:18:37.080]  that is a vaccine bracelet or some kind of paperwork that you have to carry
[03:18:37.080 --> 03:18:42.080]  around I'm not sure yet but that's step one so they got to have a vaccine
[03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:45.000]  tracking technology I think I think that's where some of the military defense
[03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:48.720]  contractors are coming into play but then secondly you got to look at the
[03:18:48.720 --> 03:18:54.080]  quarantines if they mandate vaccines those who refuse to be vaccinated are
[03:18:54.080 --> 03:18:59.120]  very likely to be quarantined which means perhaps the CDC would be leasing
[03:18:59.120 --> 03:19:05.520]  camps or facilities like FEMA camps from FEMA just just as an example and then
[03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:10.480]  making those quarantine camps where they throw you in with all the other people
[03:19:10.480 --> 03:19:13.880]  who have refused the vaccines I mean what do you think about that scenario does
[03:19:13.880 --> 03:19:17.360]  that does that sound like a reasonable way this might play out yeah and I
[03:19:17.360 --> 03:19:21.920]  wondered about that becoming reality would there be house-to-house searches
[03:19:21.920 --> 03:19:27.280]  and if you said no in your doorway give me liberty or give me death what do you
[03:19:27.280 --> 03:19:31.520]  think what would happen well I think they would just shoot you frankly because
[03:19:31.520 --> 03:19:35.560]  that's that's what they've been doing increasingly now very violent government
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:40.280]  raids armed raids I think they would become quite violent Richard I want to
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:42.760]  continue with you on the other side this break if you'll if you'll stay on hold

[03:24:17.440 --> 03:24:22.680]  this overdrive segment we have a caller Richard from Indiana that we're gonna go
[03:24:22.680 --> 03:24:27.040]  to in just a second he asked about what's going to happen if they have a
[03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:30.800]  mandatory vaccination policy how's that going to play out I think that's a
[03:24:30.800 --> 03:24:34.480]  really important question now if you recall the Institute of Medicine that
[03:24:34.480 --> 03:24:39.520]  we talked about with Alex here on the air before the overdrive section here the
[03:24:39.520 --> 03:24:46.400]  Institute of Medicine will undoubtedly be cited as the authority claiming that
[03:24:46.400 --> 03:24:51.800]  vaccines are perfectly safe and therefore mandatory vaccination policies
[03:24:51.800 --> 03:24:56.920]  are good for the nation so watch for that in the next disease outbreak which I
[03:24:56.920 --> 03:25:01.160]  think could be coming as early as this fall the government will say well when
[03:25:01.160 --> 03:25:05.320]  mandatory vaccines no problem because the Institute of Medicine said there are
[03:25:05.320 --> 03:25:09.560]  basically very few side effects watch watch for that now Richard let's go
[03:25:09.560 --> 03:25:13.240]  back to you you still on the phone with us yes one more quick question and it'll
[03:25:13.240 --> 03:25:18.440]  let you get on to other callers what could we do those who are informed who
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:23.400]  are the resistance to help avert even getting to the doorstep of forced
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:27.360]  vaccinations obviously writing our congressional members doesn't do much
[03:25:27.360 --> 03:25:32.520]  is there anything else you could tell us what we could do to help stop this
[03:25:32.520 --> 03:25:36.040]  before it gets to that point well I think what you're doing right now is a
[03:25:36.040 --> 03:25:38.760]  great example of it you're calling in here to the Alex Jones show I think we
[03:25:38.760 --> 03:25:44.040]  need to get to activism at the grassroots level you need to share the
[03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:48.840]  stories that are published on info wars.com you need to tell people about
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:52.040]  what's going on I think the more people are aware of the real dangers of
[03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:57.040]  vaccines the more difficult it's going to be for government to put a mandatory
[03:25:57.040 --> 03:26:02.560]  vaccination policy on us and if you remember during the H5N1 scare many
[03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:07.480]  of the nurses nurses and hospital workers in New York and Boston and other
[03:26:07.480 --> 03:26:11.720]  areas resisted that I mean they protested right there on the streets and
[03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:17.400]  we're adamantly against forced vaccination so that's a good sign but it
[03:26:17.400 --> 03:26:23.520]  means that the feds are going to have to create a very large infectious disease
[03:26:23.520 --> 03:26:28.960]  false flag type of event to convince people to take vaccines that's why I'm
[03:26:28.960 --> 03:26:33.760]  thinking I'm thinking theoretically one of the possible scenarios is a
[03:26:33.760 --> 03:26:38.760]  government-induced outbreak of infectious disease through the vaccines so I
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:42.640]  mean that's conjecture of course but we've seen weird things like that happen
[03:26:42.640 --> 03:26:45.840]  before but thanks for your call Richard some really good questions and you
[03:26:45.840 --> 03:26:50.280]  brought up some good points now I'd like to go to Mark in Georgia thanks for
[03:26:50.280 --> 03:26:54.000]  holding Mark how can I help you and thanks for being on the air with us
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:56.320]  today
[03:26:56.320 --> 03:26:59.160]  I guess first
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:04.200]  can you hear me okay? I just got a microphone from my iPhone up. Yeah I can hear you Mark yeah.
[03:27:04.200 --> 03:27:10.120]  From my electronics point of view my YouTube is a radical and
[03:27:10.120 --> 03:27:18.680]  I just want to tell you I can't I can't quite hear you there Mark. It's
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:26.680]  cutting the internet I apologize we got to go to John in Texas. Hi Mike. Hello John
[03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:30.160]  you're on the air go ahead. Hey first of all I'd like to thank you for all the work
[03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:33.840]  you do I've been following your work for quite some time. In fact I talk my day
[03:27:33.840 --> 03:27:42.120]  every morning updating my files by going to your emails and I'd like to point
[03:27:42.120 --> 03:27:47.960]  out that the whole concept of infection is really an illusion and that vaccines
[03:27:47.960 --> 03:27:52.640]  and even viruses are really scams and what I'd like to propose for you and
[03:27:52.640 --> 03:27:55.600]  everyone else who's trying to wake everyone else up about the vaccines is
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:27:59.840]  to consider the possibility that a virus is not what we've been led to believe
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:05.440]  and when we try to warn other people and we keep warning people about the
[03:28:05.440 --> 03:28:11.760]  viruses we're actually perpetuating the myth that there is an infection. I worked
[03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:17.360]  one of my students worked with you you guys did a six-hour audio tape his name
[03:28:17.360 --> 03:28:20.800]  is David I won't say anything else I don't want to plug anything. Alright you
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:23.360]  probably know who he is. I know I know you're talking about yeah great guy. He
[03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:26.440]  confessed to me after we worked for two years he said John you know everything
[03:28:26.440 --> 03:28:31.800]  you told me I understood you know you saved my life I was dying and and I
[03:28:31.800 --> 03:28:35.600]  know everything you're telling me is true but the virus concept was something
[03:28:35.600 --> 03:28:39.120]  that I couldn't wrap my brain around it took me two years before I finally could
[03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:44.120]  understand what you were trying to tell me and I'd love to send you some
[03:28:44.120 --> 03:28:47.280]  information if you're interested on this to find out more about it. Well let me
[03:28:47.280 --> 03:28:51.040]  for those who are listening and it might might be you know this is sort of
[03:28:51.040 --> 03:28:54.120]  new information for a lot of people but I know exactly where you're coming from
[03:28:54.120 --> 03:28:58.200]  in modern medical science there is a reductionistic point of view where
[03:28:58.200 --> 03:29:03.920]  everything has to be a physical object and they say that these the drug has to
[03:29:03.920 --> 03:29:09.480]  interlock like a key in a lock with a molecule it has to fit like a physical
