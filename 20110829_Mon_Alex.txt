[00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:10.025]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.025 --> 00:00:11.626]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:13.147]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:17.350]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.473]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.370]  Thank you so much for joining us, my friends.
[00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.090]  It is Monday, the 29th day of August, 2011.
[00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.092]  We're gonna be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:41.092 --> 00:00:49.954]  And in studio, we have the one, the only Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, joining us with some breaking news on multiple fronts.
[00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:59.016]  One of the big stories, he's gonna be breaking in more detail here, secret vaccine industry ties and military involvement with Institute of Medicine
[00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:08.059]  That continues to whitewash the reported dangers and adverse reactions caused by vaccines.
[00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:17.431]  Of course, it's the Pentagon caught testing on our own troops decade after decade, including nerve gassing many of them to death in different parts of Project Shad.
[00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.371]  The Brits are involved as well.
[00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:36.474]  That's coming up, and Mike Adams has also got more on Rossum Foods, the SWAT team raids on dairies and businesses, and how they're using Gestapo infiltration techniques of organizations that are public, so they can then dress it all up like they're criminals.
[00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:43.756]  They're basically making milk and eggs and tomatoes that are sold by the citizenry, the equivalent of cocaine.
[00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:45.096]  So that is coming up.
[00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:51.661]  As well in the third hour with Mike Adams in studio.
[00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:57.563]  There has been a fresh raft of hysteria in the European Union.
[00:01:57.563 --> 00:02:03.606]  London Telegraph Bureau bailout in doubt as hysteria sweeps Germany.
[00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:08.669]  Also a bizarre article out of the New York Times by Alan B Kruger.
[00:02:09.904 --> 00:02:13.747]  A future consumption tax to fix today's economy.
[00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:24.596]  And with a straight face, the writer says that a consumption tax of 5% basically on everything in this country would help the economy.
[00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:26.258]  Yes!
[00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:31.282]  All economic science shows that taxes slow economic growth and commerce.
[00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:32.123]  That's not debated.
[00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:36.658]  But hey, they say the answer is taxes.
[00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:40.661]  And they have a particularly ridiculous way that they spin that.
[00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:45.905]  Barack Obama's uncle has been arrested and held as an illegal immigrant.
[00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:50.989]  His aunt has been granted asylum.
[00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.053]  Also, we're going to get into, obviously, the fact that the hurricane
[00:02:57.398 --> 00:03:16.002]  Was a bunch of hype, and the New York Times also pushed the need for carbon taxes paid to Al Gore, because if you pay the high priest, he will shake his magic stick and throw some powder in the fire, and there'll be a big poof, and we'll all be healed if you pay him and Lord Rothschild your money.
[00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:17.082]  Everything will be fine.
[00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:23.804]  Hurricane lost steam as experts misjudge structure, and next move, Irene forecast on track, not up to speed with wind.
[00:03:24.844 --> 00:03:27.826]  So why the big Irene blow up?
[00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:29.447]  And it goes on from there.
[00:03:29.447 --> 00:03:30.228]  How that was hyped.
[00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:30.728]  There's another one.
[00:03:30.728 --> 00:03:32.209]  Perfect storm of hype.
[00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.892]  Politicians, the media, and the Hurricane Irene apocalypse that never was.
[00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:40.014]  But Obama is still running around today saying, be afraid.
[00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:41.895]  Be very afraid.
[00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:42.176]  Only
[00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:46.119]  FEMA can save you.
[00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:55.768]  And thank God it wasn't worse, or you know they'd be doing house-to-house searches for any guns they could find, just like you saw with FEMA and Homeland Security in Katrina.
[00:03:56.767 --> 00:04:03.694]  Also, I covered some of this yesterday, but we have an in-depth article breaking it down today at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:03.694 --> 00:04:08.099]  Gore, global warming skeptics for this generation's racist.
[00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.265]  But in the video, the minion he's talking to admits that his friends laugh at him now when he brings up
[00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:16.227]  Man-made global warming.
[00:04:16.227 --> 00:04:17.769]  So their hoax is in trouble.
[00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.393]  So Gore wants to play the card that you don't like black people, basically.
[00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:28.778]  Also, Disney factory faces probe into sweatshop suicide claims.
[00:04:28.778 --> 00:04:32.081]  And they're using child laborers there, reportedly.
[00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:32.802]  Well, why not?
[00:04:32.802 --> 00:04:34.023]  Apple does it.
[00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:35.544]  All these big companies do it.
[00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:36.785]  And then we compete against that.
[00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:38.947]  Of course, we can't compete against it.
[00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:41.609]  So we've been de-industrialized just for the globalists.
[00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:41.870]  Want us?
[00:04:43.371 --> 00:04:46.374]  Also coming up, we're gonna get into Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:49.797]  Kingpin is new military commander for Tripoli.
[00:04:49.797 --> 00:04:52.559]  It's official.
[00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:56.963]  And a lot more on the other side of this power-packed transmission.
[00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:57.484]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:01.617]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:08.560]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.101]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:16.484]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.484 --> 00:05:19.525]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.525 --> 00:05:21.586]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.846 --> 00:05:28.091]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:31.474]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:37.259]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:38.901]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:40.202]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:40.202 --> 00:05:42.864]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:47.108]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:47.108 --> 00:05:49.670]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.694]  End of America 3.com.
[00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:54.301]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:05:54.301 --> 00:05:58.170]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.252]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.106]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:12.553]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:06:12.553 --> 00:06:14.816]  Number one, study the past.
[00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:17.219]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:20.943]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:25.150]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.993]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:34.037]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:06:34.037 --> 00:06:38.039]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.462]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:06:41.462 --> 00:06:45.104]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:50.871]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:55.497]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:06:55.497 --> 00:06:57.680]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:04.980]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.221]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:08.221 --> 00:07:13.042]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:19.404]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:21.645]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:22.205 --> 00:07:22.465]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:22.645]  Bernanke?
[00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:23.025]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:23.726]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:25.687]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:42.956]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:07:42.956 --> 00:07:48.380]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:08:01.008]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:01.008 --> 00:08:06.552]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.926 --> 00:08:20.927]  Well, we have set sail again across the airwaves.
[00:08:20.927 --> 00:08:27.409]  Worldwide on XM Satellite, Global Shortwave, WWCR, streaming over the internet.
[00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:32.951]  Number one streamed internet program in the world in talk radio.
[00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:39.273]  According to ShotKast.com and other metrics blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:42.834]  As well, it is Monday, the 29th day of August, 2011.
[00:08:45.097 --> 00:08:53.720]  Can you believe that 2011 has gotten so long in the tooth before we know it 2012 would have come and gone and well we'll still be here.
[00:08:55.319 --> 00:08:57.440]  Comets wouldn't have killed us.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.541]  Planets out of deep space wouldn't have killed us.
[00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:08.785]  If we're not here, it'll probably be a bioweapon that's released or nuclear war, but I don't think that's going to happen either in the short term.
[00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:10.505]  But it always could.
[00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:15.348]  Here we are sitting now, more than two-thirds of the way into 2011.
[00:09:19.736 --> 00:09:21.961]  Okay, I'm gonna do something I don't customarily do.
[00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:27.452]  I'm gonna open the phones up, or at least get the number out, right here, at the start of this worldwide transmission.
[00:09:28.683 --> 00:09:33.704]  Now I've got the news I'm going to cover, and I'd love to hear what you have to say about these issues I'm about to go over.
[00:09:33.704 --> 00:09:37.144]  We're going to open the phones up and we're going to take a lot of calls today.
[00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:39.285]  I've actually been doing a better job.
[00:09:39.285 --> 00:09:47.206]  And if you want to talk about Irene, the hurricane that really never was, and the way they're saying, oh, it's global warming, pay more taxes.
[00:09:47.206 --> 00:09:53.747]  If you want to get into Obama's uncle being arrested and held as an illegal immigrant.
[00:09:53.747 --> 00:09:57.468]  If you want to get into secret vaccine industry ties and military involvement.
[00:09:58.942 --> 00:10:08.092]  Or if you want to get into sex offenders paid by the state of Chicago to babysit in government programs knowingly.
[00:10:08.092 --> 00:10:17.342]  Or if you want to talk about the ongoing hunt for Muammar Gaddafi and the fact that even mainstream media is being forced to admit that, yes indeed,
[00:10:20.216 --> 00:10:24.278]  The leader of the rebels is a Al Qaeda operative.
[00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:42.125]  We told you this months ago with Webster Tarpley and others that came out in the LA Times, Associated Press, but now it is absolutely confirmed and the rebels are refusing to hand over the reported bomber of the Lockerbie Scotland aircraft.
[00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:44.466]  Now, whether you think that they really did that or not,
[00:10:45.618 --> 00:10:46.218]  I don't think so.
[00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:08.813]  Also, I've got some other news I want to go over.
[00:11:08.813 --> 00:11:14.095]  Obama invoked September 11th attacks and called for service, Reuters reports.
[00:11:14.095 --> 00:11:20.559]  He talked about the firefighters and police and others that valiantly helped on 9-11 and called for Americans to, quote, serve.
[00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:29.983]  But the police, the military, the firefighters, the medics who are actual victims, they're not allowed at the 10th anniversary.
[00:11:29.983 --> 00:11:30.844]  They're not allowed there.
[00:11:32.017 --> 00:11:37.481]  So, there he is using them to look like a hero himself, but barring them.
[00:11:37.481 --> 00:11:40.744]  Also, Mexican staged drug raids inside the U.S.
[00:11:40.744 --> 00:11:41.424]  You heard me right.
[00:11:41.424 --> 00:11:43.326]  The New York Times even admits this.
[00:11:43.326 --> 00:11:46.128]  Kurt Nemo has an excellent article breaking it down.
[00:11:46.128 --> 00:11:48.309]  They don't just allow Mexican police inside the U.S.
[00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:56.415]  for raids, but Mexican military commandos have, quote, discreetly traveled to the United States, told you this years ago, assembled at designated areas.
[00:11:57.336 --> 00:12:02.359]  And dispatch helicopter missions back across the border aimed at suspected drug traffickers.
[00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:05.701]  The DEA is providing logistical support and sharing intelligence.
[00:12:05.701 --> 00:12:14.207]  This is part of the North American Union SPP deal, Security Prosperity Partnership, to use Canadian-Mexican troops inside the U.S.
[00:12:14.207 --> 00:12:21.772]  for any reason, including crowd control, anti-terror, drug raids, civil emergencies, disasters.
[00:12:22.796 --> 00:12:29.657]  And people keep reporting on three, four, five years ago about Mexican helicopters landing, burning buildings, shooting people.
[00:12:29.657 --> 00:12:33.278]  I've had sheriffs on from South Texas that have been three miles over the border.
[00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:41.180]  And Mexican troops pull up on the highway and humvees, aim machine guns at them and say, give us that marijuana or cocaine you just confiscated.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.441]  One case the sheriffs had a dump truck full of marijuana that they'd picked up on the U.S.
[00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:46.321]  side.
[00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:50.302]  Mexican troops came across, put the guns on them, and loudspeakers said,
[00:12:51.182 --> 00:12:52.544]  Get away from the vehicle.
[00:12:52.544 --> 00:12:54.445]  Mexican troops got in the vehicle, drove it away.
[00:12:54.445 --> 00:12:57.328]  And they go to the federal government and say, do something about this.
[00:12:57.328 --> 00:13:02.913]  And the feds go, you don't understand, do you?
[00:13:02.913 --> 00:13:05.495]  What's really going on here is that this is a U.S.
[00:13:05.495 --> 00:13:16.465]  government big bank system openly knocking out the other cartels that aren't laundering their money through the big western banks.
[00:13:16.465 --> 00:13:17.306]  That's what's going on here.
[00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:22.568]  And it's all part of destroying our sovereignty.
[00:13:32.051 --> 00:13:42.474]  Intelligence services and troops from 14 different countries take part in quote, taking on domestic terrorists here in the United States.
[00:13:42.474 --> 00:13:49.396]  Also, burglar's family awarded $300,000 in wrongful death suit.
[00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:52.317]  This is out of El Paso, Texas.
[00:13:52.317 --> 00:13:56.498]  And the family business had been robbed repeatedly.
[00:13:59.153 --> 00:14:26.107]  A family business had been robbed repeatedly, so the family stayed up late, stayed in the business, and when the armed, admitted methamphetamine addicts, it's all here in the article, came in, they shot one of them, who was armed, and the jury has ruled that, and I'm seeing more and more of this, that they are civilly liable.
[00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.793]  My friends, there's a castle doctrine.
[00:14:30.793 --> 00:14:37.796]  You can shoot someone if they come in your house and break in, period, day or night.
[00:14:37.796 --> 00:14:40.777]  If it's nighttime, you can shoot somebody in your yard.
[00:14:40.777 --> 00:14:44.939]  Now, if it's found that you lured them in and it was a murder, that's a different story.
[00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:52.982]  But if it's a criminal with a criminal record and there's been other burglaries, you're going to get no billed by the grand jury even if it's in your yard.
[00:14:54.224 --> 00:14:59.107]  And we see cases of this all over the country where people have been robbed over and over and over again.
[00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:02.310]  So, they leave their garage door open.
[00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.531]  It was just a Texas case a few months ago.
[00:15:04.531 --> 00:15:08.034]  And they sit there like they're deer hunting.
[00:15:08.034 --> 00:15:14.218]  And when the person comes in to steal their bicycle again, they shoot them and they kill them.
[00:15:14.218 --> 00:15:17.861]  And when you have that type of activity, you have much lower crime rates.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:26.622]  There's a reason Chicago, New York, and other areas have the highest crime rates in the United States because they're victim disarmament zones.
[00:15:26.622 --> 00:15:31.544]  The muggings in England are off the charts compared to the United States.
[00:15:31.544 --> 00:15:33.724]  The muggings are going on.
[00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:36.525]  That's why muggers generally target women in the U.S.
[00:15:36.525 --> 00:15:39.586]  because statistically they're not armed as much as men and can't fight back.
[00:15:40.868 --> 00:15:46.651]  But more and more they're not mugging women because women are going out getting concealed carries or just carrying firearms.
[00:15:46.651 --> 00:15:52.915]  I know my two girls will have concealed carry and they will carry firearms when they move out of the house.
[00:15:52.915 --> 00:16:00.339]  And they are, the seven-year-old is already very, very accurate with a rifle and a handgun.
[00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:02.120]  And so that's the bottom line.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:10.004]  True feminism is to empower your girls and your boys, not to teach them to be little helpless people.
[00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:17.326]  Let me just cover this article first because it goes to the heart of everything that we're facing as a society.
[00:16:17.326 --> 00:16:23.570]  This is out of the Gazette, Colorado Springs.
[00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:30.015]  Burglars family awarded $300,000 in wrongful death suit.
[00:16:30.015 --> 00:16:34.659]  This is actually El Paso County, so this is in Colorado, El Paso, Texas.
[00:16:35.555 --> 00:16:42.817]  On Friday, awarded nearly $300,000 to the daughter of a burglar who was fatally shot in 2009 while breaking into an auto lot.
[00:16:43.479 --> 00:17:03.268]  Parents of the victim, Robert Johnson Fox, embraced their attorneys after a judge announced the jury's verdict, capping a two-week long civil trial in which business owner Jovan Milovac and his two relatives were painted as vigilantes who plotted a deadly ambush rather than led authorities.
[00:17:03.268 --> 00:17:06.289]  How do cops have the authority to shoot somebody if they feel threatened?
[00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:09.951]  Because they've been given arrest powers by the citizens.
[00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:17.717]  They've been hired by the incorporated city or empowered by the legislature at the county level.
[00:17:17.717 --> 00:17:31.867]  Phillip and Sue Fox, who filed suit for the wrongful death in 2010 on behalf of Fox's three-year-old daughter, called the jury's award a victory in their fight to seek accountability for the death of their son, who they say never posed a threat to the heavily armed men.
[00:17:33.154 --> 00:17:37.937]  And again, they broke in through a barbed wire, tall barbed wire fence.
[00:17:37.937 --> 00:17:41.139]  Rob was in the wrong place and doing the wrong thing.
[00:17:41.139 --> 00:17:43.081]  But the punishment didn't fit the crime.
[00:17:43.081 --> 00:17:46.143]  Sue Fox said afterward, you ever been the victim of a home invasion?
[00:17:46.143 --> 00:17:49.024]  You ever had armed people breaking in?
[00:17:49.024 --> 00:17:51.966]  I can't excuse his actions, but he didn't deserve to be executed.
[00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:54.228]  Well, it's at night and you're breaking into a facility.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:04.404]  The exact amount awarded was $269,500 for factors such as loss of companionship and loss of future earnings.
[00:18:04.404 --> 00:18:06.145]  What, from robbing places?
[00:18:06.145 --> 00:18:11.027]  The family will also be awarded some of the costs associated with the more than year-long legal battle.
[00:18:12.062 --> 00:18:24.949]  Now, I don't think the punishment fit the crime, but still, it's a castle right, an ancient tree holder right, Magna Carta 1215 right, that if somebody comes on your land, especially at night, you can kill them.
[00:18:24.949 --> 00:18:27.190]  People should know this.
[00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.771]  You should know this.
[00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:31.552]  Especially if no trespassing signs are posted, and they were.
[00:18:31.552 --> 00:18:38.996]  The jury of three men and three women deliberated for two and a half days over closely contested testimony about the pre-dawn shooting on April 19th, 2009.
[00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:48.792]  Fox 20 was shot after he and a friend scaled a fence to get inside Southwest Auto Sales in the city's Nov Hill neighborhood.
[00:18:48.792 --> 00:18:57.537]  According to the accomplice, Brian Corbin, they had smoked methamphetamine and were looking to steal anything to buy more drugs.
[00:18:57.537 --> 00:19:05.542]  Corbin testified he saw two armed men charging out of a building and run in the direction, one of them shouting, we're going to get you in an obscenity-laced threat.
[00:19:06.766 --> 00:19:16.614]  Corbin, who escaped by climbing over a car and jumping the fence as he felt a bullet pass by him as someone fired four gunshots.
[00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:23.160]  Fox was standing inside a small shed when a .45 caliber bullet passed through the shed's door and pierced his heart.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:33.369]  Police said in a 145-page investigative report that the intruder had knives in his pockets and one strapped to his ankle, but never posed a threat to the other men.
[00:19:36.018 --> 00:19:38.999]  The men are refugees, United States from former Yugoslavia, 98.
[00:19:38.999 --> 00:19:46.683]  And they went on to say to the jury that it was willful, deliberate conduct of them to shoot him.
[00:19:46.683 --> 00:19:49.184]  And it just goes on.
[00:19:49.184 --> 00:19:50.204]  So there you go.
[00:19:50.204 --> 00:19:56.287]  And soon it'll be like England, where when you're being stabbed in your house, if you fight back, you go to prison.
[00:19:56.287 --> 00:20:00.189]  The government wants you trained, you're not allowed to defend yourself or your property.
[00:20:00.942 --> 00:20:07.345]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:08.786]  I lost 20 pounds.
[00:20:08.786 --> 00:20:10.467]  I lost 40 pounds.
[00:20:10.467 --> 00:20:12.748]  I lost 55 pounds.
[00:20:12.748 --> 00:20:14.148]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[00:20:15.635 --> 00:20:22.521]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:26.184]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:30.267]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[00:20:30.267 --> 00:20:36.793]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:45.356]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[00:21:31.444 --> 00:21:36.007]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:36.007 --> 00:21:41.811]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.811 --> 00:21:45.453]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:01.116 --> 00:23:05.220]  You used to be energetic, happy, and wow, did the ladies love you.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.783]  Now, you fall asleep on the couch, irritable, and out of shape.
[00:23:08.783 --> 00:23:10.165]  Don't be that guy!

[00:23:45.194 --> 00:23:45.854]  Don't wait another day.
[00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:51.799]  Just call 1-800-847-6170.
[00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:52.020]  Again, 1-800-847-6170.
[00:24:26.189 --> 00:24:28.550]  Coming to shoot me.
[00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:35.194]  So I shot him.
[00:24:35.194 --> 00:24:48.823]  See, when somebody's pulling a gun on you, even federal courts have ruled, even if it's a cop, and they're not in the right, you have a right to defend yourself.
[00:24:48.823 --> 00:24:50.384]  And it's the same thing goes
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:58.843]  For a police officer, if somebody's waving a gun around at them, they don't have to wait until you shoot them to protect themselves.
[00:24:58.843 --> 00:25:01.344]  They've got the same powers a citizen has.
[00:25:01.344 --> 00:25:03.565]  They derive their powers from that.
[00:25:03.565 --> 00:25:05.406]  From the common law power.
[00:25:05.406 --> 00:25:07.687]  That's what it all flows from.
[00:25:07.687 --> 00:25:16.972]  And sure, this young 20-year-old meth head, out of his mind, trying to break into a place they admit to steal.
[00:25:16.972 --> 00:25:19.453]  The place had been robbed before, that's why the family was there waiting.
[00:25:21.573 --> 00:25:24.135]  I don't think the punishment fits the crime.
[00:25:24.135 --> 00:25:26.776]  I don't think it's good that he is dead.
[00:25:26.776 --> 00:25:44.407]  I'll be honest, I was never a big thief, but I grew up on a golf course and I learned from older friends how to go up to the country club and the golfers would have a big container, an ice chest on the back of their golf carts full of beer.
[00:25:46.235 --> 00:25:50.199]  And I only did it a few times, mainly when older kids would say, come on, it's your turn.
[00:25:50.199 --> 00:25:51.060]  We want some beer.
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.522]  I'd be like 12, 13, 14 years old.
[00:25:53.522 --> 00:25:54.003]  All right.
[00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:57.846]  I remember, I remember going to...
[00:25:58.854 --> 00:26:01.476]  Just like in Caddyshack at the Country Club.
[00:26:01.476 --> 00:26:07.240]  Wasn't as fancy as the Caddyshack Country Club, but you'd have all the adults at the Country Club drinking.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.582]  They'd leave their drink, sitting there half drunk.
[00:26:09.582 --> 00:26:21.791]  Just like in Caddyshack, where Spalding is going down the bar, taking a drink out of each one, and then he drinks one that has a cigarette in it, and goes out and vomits in the guy's Porsche.
[00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:23.232]  Alright, I'm digressing.
[00:26:23.232 --> 00:26:24.172]  Back to some memories.
[00:26:24.172 --> 00:26:25.734]  So, I wouldn't want
[00:26:26.758 --> 00:26:30.959]  My child, doing what I did, grabbing some beer, or grabbing some watermelons.
[00:26:30.959 --> 00:26:39.321]  In fact, I have some cousins that told the story of, just for fun, stealing some watermelons.
[00:26:39.321 --> 00:26:49.023]  And they were running off with them, and here came the shotgun pellets, and they were too far away for it to penetrate, but it sure hurt them.
[00:26:49.023 --> 00:26:50.203]  The old timers knew how to do it.
[00:26:51.311 --> 00:26:54.453]  They caught you climbing over their fence, just messing with their chickens.
[00:26:54.453 --> 00:26:57.214]  They'd shoot you with a, you know, number 8 birdshot.
[00:26:57.214 --> 00:27:00.636]  You might get a pellet in you or something.
[00:27:00.636 --> 00:27:06.080]  You know, they probably, if they caught somebody out stealing their tomatoes or whatever, they wouldn't shoot you with a .30-06.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.101]  They wouldn't kill you.
[00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:10.082]  They'd say, you best start running, boy!
[00:27:10.082 --> 00:27:12.664]  Soon as you got about 50 yards away, BOOM!
[00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:14.425]  I don't come back!
[00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:36.645]  So if, but if my place had been robbed repeatedly, and I was there with adrenaline, sitting there with a hunting instinct, maybe for days, waiting, because the cops couldn't protect you or, you know, they couldn't station a cop outside their auto dealership, and then here come the guys, and you know, they're taking the word of one of the people that broke in here.
[00:27:37.878 --> 00:27:43.021]  That well, yeah, we had weapons, knives all taped to us, but we weren't a threat.
[00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:48.443]  You're on somebody's property at night with a weapon.
[00:27:48.443 --> 00:27:54.526]  We've got to protect people's rights to live in their homes and their businesses at night.
[00:27:54.526 --> 00:27:58.088]  You don't go down a badger hole at night.
[00:27:58.088 --> 00:27:59.589]  You don't go in a bear's cave.
[00:27:59.589 --> 00:28:01.570]  You don't come on somebody's property.
[00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.531]  You don't break in somebody's business.
[00:28:03.531 --> 00:28:05.832]  If you're willing to break in somebody's business at night,
[00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:12.775]  You're willing to do other crimes, and that's why you're considered armed and dangerous.
[00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:18.479]  That's why common law says you can be killed.
[00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:25.545]  And it's easy to second-guess people that kill folks that break in their houses or businesses.
[00:28:25.545 --> 00:28:33.131]  But people that break in houses should know you've got a good chance of getting your hind end killed.
[00:28:33.131 --> 00:28:34.893]  Alright, now I've already spent too much time on this.
[00:28:36.578 --> 00:28:39.121]  But I wanted to fully flesh that issue out.
[00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:39.782]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:28:39.782 --> 00:28:40.703]  This is a short segment.
[00:28:40.703 --> 00:28:48.392]  Come back to Joe, Johnny, Tim, Tina, Carlos, and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:28:48.392 --> 00:28:49.594]  When you hear a caller hang up.
[00:28:50.649 --> 00:28:52.411]  It's your chance to call in 800-259-9231.
[00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:52.771]  800-259-9231.
[00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:59.738]  My phone system has unlimited lines.
[00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:00.118]  Hundreds.
[00:29:00.118 --> 00:29:01.139]  It's digital.
[00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:07.425]  Genesis only has five lines and a sixth line for guests.
[00:29:07.425 --> 00:29:10.548]  And I really think Ted ought to add more lines.
[00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:15.112]  Because we could have a hundred people on hold there that could sit there all day.
[00:29:15.112 --> 00:29:15.633]  I'm just joking.
[00:29:17.017 --> 00:29:19.719]  So we're going to be going to your phone calls.
[00:29:19.719 --> 00:29:22.761]  You can hear that my voice is a little bit out.
[00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:24.482]  It's because I started screaming again yesterday.
[00:29:24.482 --> 00:29:28.844]  And my voice has gotten to a point where I just can't scream.
[00:29:28.844 --> 00:29:34.167]  I'm sure if I went to a doctor and they checked my larynx, it probably looks like a piece of dried leather.
[00:29:34.167 --> 00:29:37.990]  But I've got so much other news coming up.
[00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:39.250]  I haven't even gotten into the news yet.
[00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.791]  But your calls first.
[00:29:40.791 --> 00:29:41.092]  Then...
[00:29:42.481 --> 00:29:44.103]  Oh yes, Dick Cheney.
[00:29:44.103 --> 00:29:46.166]  One year as a walking zombie.
[00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:47.208]  Tell you about that report.
[00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:49.932]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.932 --> 00:29:51.334]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.334 --> 00:29:53.857]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.857 --> 00:29:56.541]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.503 --> 00:30:06.464]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:06.464 --> 00:30:15.325]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:15.325 --> 00:30:19.946]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:19.946 --> 00:30:30.768]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:31.408 --> 00:30:40.910]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:46.352]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:30:46.352 --> 00:30:53.833]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:56.594]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:31:00.459 --> 00:31:01.640]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:08.564]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:08.564 --> 00:31:11.106]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:11.106 --> 00:31:16.489]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.489 --> 00:31:19.531]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.531 --> 00:31:21.612]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.852 --> 00:31:28.095]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:28.095 --> 00:31:31.477]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.477 --> 00:31:37.260]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.901]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.901 --> 00:31:40.202]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:40.202 --> 00:31:42.883]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.883 --> 00:31:47.106]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:47.106 --> 00:31:48.806]  You can find the video at www.
[00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:53.309]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:09.859]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.859 --> 00:32:14.743]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.743 --> 00:32:15.484]  It's true.
[00:32:15.484 --> 00:32:21.189]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:24.772]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.772 --> 00:32:28.475]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.675 --> 00:32:29.476]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:32.238]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.238 --> 00:32:35.921]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:36.701]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:40.844]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.844 --> 00:32:45.608]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.908 --> 00:32:50.069]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.069 --> 00:32:51.849]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.849 --> 00:32:54.110]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:54.110 --> 00:33:03.652]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:03.652 --> 00:33:10.234]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:10.234 --> 00:33:14.155]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.743]  Okay, we're going to your phone calls.
[00:33:21.743 --> 00:33:32.235]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.235 --> 00:33:33.697]  Hey, the great interrupter!
[00:33:33.697 --> 00:33:35.819]  He's been interrupting my own liners.
[00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:36.901]  Can't do any better than that.
[00:33:39.275 --> 00:33:40.456]  I haven't played that liner in a while.
[00:33:40.456 --> 00:33:42.157]  I forgot how long it is.
[00:33:42.157 --> 00:33:43.799]  Okay, it is Monday.
[00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:48.002]  It is the 29th day of August, 2011.
[00:33:48.002 --> 00:33:50.464]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:33:50.464 --> 00:33:53.867]  Then coming up, Gore.
[00:33:53.867 --> 00:34:03.495]  Global warming skeptics are this generation's racists, and he says that we've got to be ostracized, demonized, and ultimately, like in Europe, they're trying to say it's like Holocaust denial.
[00:34:03.495 --> 00:34:04.916]  They want to make it illegal.
[00:34:05.899 --> 00:34:07.320]  That's been actually called for.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.923]  Al Gore plays the race card, but he's the real racist.
[00:34:10.923 --> 00:34:22.834]  Very important article by Paul Joseph Watson, pointing out that the carbon taxes alone, the Copenhagen Treaty writers admitted, would kill at least a billion people in the next decade if implemented.
[00:34:23.973 --> 00:34:27.174]  Because most folks are on $2 a day or less worldwide.
[00:34:27.174 --> 00:34:29.195]  More than half that money goes to food.
[00:34:29.195 --> 00:34:32.996]  You increase the energy prices that go into the food, it will be a death sentence.
[00:34:32.996 --> 00:34:36.177]  Not to mention the biofuels that he spearheaded.
[00:34:36.177 --> 00:34:40.758]  He's now had to admit that his biofuels, after he got caught, have killed millions.
[00:34:40.758 --> 00:34:42.919]  And he's been the big guy pushing those.
[00:34:42.919 --> 00:34:47.861]  It's one thing to put your waste into biofuels, but to have most of our corn crop in this country
[00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:54.505]  Going into biofuels, not even corn syrup, certainly a death sentence.
[00:34:54.505 --> 00:34:59.489]  Also Disney factory faces probe into sweatshop suicide claims.
[00:34:59.489 --> 00:35:02.871]  Human rights campaigners say Chinese factories are using children as young as 14.
[00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:05.473]  We're talking about 120 hours of overtime per period, standing for 12 hours non-stop.
[00:35:13.124 --> 00:35:20.653]  And having to huff the deadly gases, that's the big thing, is that, man, I worked in a print shop for three months.
[00:35:20.653 --> 00:35:24.018]  A buddy got me a job and I thought, well, this is 12 bucks an hour.
[00:35:24.018 --> 00:35:28.383]  This is better than eight bucks an hour working at a golf course or something going to college.
[00:35:28.383 --> 00:35:29.845]  And they said, okay, you're on the shrink wrapper.
[00:35:31.024 --> 00:35:35.027]  And I was high as a kite every day by lunch.
[00:35:35.027 --> 00:35:38.670]  A few times I even went and threw up in the bathroom.
[00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.072]  And after about a month I said, I'm gonna have to quit.
[00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:42.694]  I can't run that shrink wrapper.
[00:35:42.694 --> 00:35:44.995]  I said, I don't care if there's a fan over there.
[00:35:44.995 --> 00:35:48.839]  It's not working, this big industrial shrink wrapper back in the back of the building.
[00:35:48.839 --> 00:35:51.461]  And I said, I'll do anything else.
[00:35:51.461 --> 00:35:54.984]  They said, fine, you'll be the one that unloads the pallets and everything.
[00:35:55.913 --> 00:35:58.134]  And then they put me back on the shrink wrapper.
[00:35:58.134 --> 00:35:59.475]  And I said, I just can't do this.
[00:35:59.475 --> 00:36:08.520]  I mean, can you imagine working in these factories where there's no environmental standards, no nothing?
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:17.525]  Again, that's why the globalists want to put more and more regulations on us, because then it moves everything to China, which they own, increasing their profits.
[00:36:17.525 --> 00:36:23.949]  They put regulations on Western companies to make it impossible to operate, and then they make you move to China where there's no controls.
[00:36:25.287 --> 00:36:26.508]  So that's coming up.
[00:36:26.508 --> 00:36:28.270]  Sex offenders paid to babysit.
[00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.891]  Chicago Tribune.
[00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:32.613]  There's a lot more to this story than just what they're reporting.
[00:36:32.613 --> 00:36:36.817]  The State Department of Human Services poorly vetted babysitters for years.
[00:36:36.817 --> 00:36:41.000]  And when in 2009 law forced better checks, it took nearly 18 months to start them.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.404]  The newspaper investigation on child care assistance program.
[00:36:45.404 --> 00:36:47.165]  Multiple time rapist.
[00:36:47.165 --> 00:36:48.226]  Drug dealers.
[00:36:48.226 --> 00:36:48.807]  Pedophiles.
[00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:53.654]  Well, remember five years ago, CNN reported on it?
[00:36:53.654 --> 00:37:03.361]  Thousands of missing children in Florida, and the CPS was taking them out of state, and it turned out the number one, number two, and number three heads of CPS were all convicted child rapists.
[00:37:03.361 --> 00:37:05.243]  They said, oh, what an accident.
[00:37:05.243 --> 00:37:07.084]  It's not an accident.
[00:37:07.084 --> 00:37:08.545]  That's who they recruit.
[00:37:08.545 --> 00:37:17.092]  I heard Travis County a few months ago on the news, they played a clip of Commissioner's Court, trying to pass a law at the county level that they can hire felons.
[00:37:18.931 --> 00:37:22.752]  And quite frankly, they put so many people in prison who don't deserve to be felons.
[00:37:22.752 --> 00:37:23.833]  I can see that.
[00:37:23.833 --> 00:37:25.734]  We're this giant prison population.
[00:37:25.734 --> 00:37:28.475]  But the problem is, then they want to hire criminals.
[00:37:28.475 --> 00:37:30.555]  Because they're criminals.
[00:37:30.555 --> 00:37:33.656]  Alright, so that's coming up.
[00:37:33.656 --> 00:37:37.598]  Secret vaccine industry ties and military involvement with the Institute of Medicine.
[00:37:39.005 --> 00:37:42.349]  We're going to get into Libyan rebels killing black Gaddafi supporters.
[00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:43.109]  That's now confirmed.
[00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:44.731]  Even the Washington Post.
[00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:50.757]  As expected, widespread racist murders in Libya at the hands of rebel forces revealed.
[00:37:50.757 --> 00:37:53.180]  Al-Qaeda kingpin is new military commander of Tripoli.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.662]  That's now confirmed.
[00:37:54.662 --> 00:37:57.805]  BBC responds over false Tripoli footage.
[00:37:57.805 --> 00:38:00.187]  They put out fake video of people celebrating.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.801]  Told you.
[00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:03.663]  Now it's admitted.
[00:38:03.663 --> 00:38:04.584]  Lockerbie case.
[00:38:04.584 --> 00:38:06.325]  Libyans won't deport bomber.
[00:38:06.325 --> 00:38:08.648]  The new Al-Qaeda leaders won't deport him.
[00:38:08.648 --> 00:38:11.711]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss, or even worse.
[00:38:11.711 --> 00:38:18.298]  The liberation of Libya, NATO, Special Forces, Al-Qaeda join hands.
[00:38:18.298 --> 00:38:21.461]  Libya, the greatest betrayal and handing over Libya to Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:21.461 --> 00:38:22.763]  The line has been crossed forever.
[00:38:25.663 --> 00:38:31.327]  Tripoli Psychiatric Hospital overwhelmed by war, fallout, absolute humanitarian disaster over there.
[00:38:31.327 --> 00:38:33.768]  And it's not like Gaddafi was still engaging in terror.
[00:38:33.768 --> 00:38:38.671]  He rolled over for seven years, sort of giving all the major investments to Goldman Sachs and others.
[00:38:38.671 --> 00:38:40.773]  He sold out to the globalists.
[00:38:40.773 --> 00:38:42.494]  He's a bad guy, they're bad.
[00:38:42.494 --> 00:38:50.479]  But you notice that right when he tried to come in out of the dark, come in out of the cold, that's when they set him up and are now putting folks even worse in.
[00:38:51.786 --> 00:38:52.967]  Okay.
[00:38:52.967 --> 00:38:55.388]  Only in America, as Don King would say.
[00:38:55.388 --> 00:38:56.909]  Let's talk to Joe in Pennsylvania.
[00:38:56.909 --> 00:38:58.990]  You're on the air, Joe.
[00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.832]  Alex, greetings from the city of Brotherly Corruption.
[00:39:01.832 --> 00:39:03.353]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:03.353 --> 00:39:12.798]  Have you seen anything about this Army Ranger, Captain John Leonard Englund, who killed four people in two states over here during the hurricane?
[00:39:15.143 --> 00:39:17.765]  No, but we could search his name.
[00:39:17.765 --> 00:39:20.388]  Let me just get my mouse working here.
[00:39:20.388 --> 00:39:24.231]  This mouse is driving me insane.
[00:39:24.231 --> 00:39:29.015]  It either moves too easily or won't move.
[00:39:29.015 --> 00:39:30.377]  What's his name?
[00:39:30.377 --> 00:39:36.082]  It's John Leonard and the last name is E-G-L-A-N-D.
[00:39:38.353 --> 00:39:39.414]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:39:39.414 --> 00:39:47.598]  Police, Virginia, soldier kills four in Virginia, PA, shoots cop, kills himself.
[00:39:47.598 --> 00:39:50.900]  And I'll learn more about that, but tell us about it.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:58.204]  Well, it seems like this guy, from the stories I've read, it looks like they're making it out to be some sort of domestic dispute.
[00:39:58.204 --> 00:40:02.086]  He apparently killed his estranged wife, her boyfriend,
[00:40:02.648 --> 00:40:09.194]  The boyfriend's son and then traveled up here to Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia and killed her mother.
[00:40:09.194 --> 00:40:12.517]  Well, any cop will tell you domestic disputes are the worst.
[00:40:12.517 --> 00:40:18.883]  That Richard Poplosky that killed three cops, he had two pit bulls that were urinating everywhere.
[00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:21.365]  His mother said, you're kicked out of the house if you don't get rid of him.
[00:40:21.365 --> 00:40:22.546]  He threw a fit.
[00:40:22.546 --> 00:40:23.447]  She called the cops.
[00:40:23.447 --> 00:40:24.648]  He was drunk.
[00:40:24.648 --> 00:40:25.488]  He killed the cops.
[00:40:26.496 --> 00:40:29.878]  And then it turned out he hated me and was attacking me all over the internet.
[00:40:29.878 --> 00:40:33.341]  So what did the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center do?
[00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:34.462]  They said that he loved me.
[00:40:34.462 --> 00:40:38.625]  Any excuse to demonize this radio show?
[00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:54.456]  That's the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center's immediately what I thought of with that warning about returning veterans coming and how they could pose the most danger to us ordinary citizens.
[00:40:56.815 --> 00:41:10.343]  It's just there's something not right about this story and then he apparently kills himself after he drops off his daughter at a local hospital and then goes off into the woods and kills himself.
[00:41:10.343 --> 00:41:12.645]  Although nothing's been officially declared.
[00:41:12.645 --> 00:41:24.111]  Well, I'll tell you, the veterans are not the number one threat for quote terrorism, but as their pensions get cut, as they... Look, I appreciate your call.
[00:41:24.111 --> 00:41:26.393]  Let me just briefly speak to this since you raised it.
[00:41:28.314 --> 00:41:53.748]  If you take men and you put them in one, two, three, four, five, or even six tours of heavy combat, especially special forces types, and what they know how to do is release their killer instinct, and they've got post-traumatic stress issues, and they come home, and the government takes their pension funds away,
[00:41:54.622 --> 00:41:58.844]  Through inflation and through cuts, as they're now announcing, they're gonna do.
[00:41:58.844 --> 00:42:03.165]  And as family pressures and everything else happens, imagine you're a veteran.
[00:42:03.165 --> 00:42:12.068]  You come home, you've been through absolute hell, you're back in spoiled, rotten America, with a bunch of people griping, complaining at you, and all you know how to do is kill people.
[00:42:12.068 --> 00:42:14.549]  You're gonna go crazy and you're gonna kill a bunch of people.
[00:42:14.549 --> 00:42:17.290]  That's why the Postal Service has the term going postal.
[00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:19.831]  Because it's full of veterans and people.
[00:42:19.831 --> 00:42:22.252]  Because they give veterans preferential hiring.
[00:42:23.386 --> 00:42:35.456]  And you got a bunch of vets in there and whatever things go wrong, it's been advertised to them as a way to deal with it is kill your supervisor, kill yourself.
[00:42:35.456 --> 00:42:38.018]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:42:38.018 --> 00:42:45.104]  Now, you add to this that you have a lot of suicides and killings with one tour in Vietnam or one tour in Korea or World War II.
[00:42:45.104 --> 00:42:49.188]  I mean, everybody knows about the old vet that lives down the street.
[00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:59.877]  I mean, I gotta tell you, all the old vets I knew that were my grandfather's World War II buddies, they were all really nice, but you'd hear stories about them.
[00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:02.519]  You know, if anybody crossed them or anything, they were just ready to kill.
[00:43:02.519 --> 00:43:08.724]  And that's why the police always leave the old vets alone, because they know this person is just ready to start killing people.
[00:43:09.634 --> 00:43:11.255]  And that's the way it works.
[00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:17.621]  And that's why it's so dangerous, they're hiring people that have not been in one tour, but two, three, four, five, six.
[00:43:17.621 --> 00:43:23.646]  They found out in World War I, don't have somebody serve more than one year in combat.
[00:43:23.646 --> 00:43:27.189]  Some people thrive in it, but a big percentage, 35-40%, become extremely unstable.
[00:43:32.639 --> 00:43:34.020]  Now, what are they doing?
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.781]  We showed you the DPS memo here in Texas a month ago.
[00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:42.845]  They are quietly discriminating and only trying to hire combat veterans.
[00:43:42.845 --> 00:43:52.570]  Now what's going to happen with a combat veteran who's got serious screws loose when they pull you over and tell you they want to search your car and you say no?
[00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:53.651]  They're going to pistol whip you.
[00:43:53.651 --> 00:43:54.451]  They're going to taser you.
[00:43:54.451 --> 00:43:55.132]  They're going to shoot you.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:01.744]  That's why more and more you'll see veteran cops, they just get somebody on the ground, nobody knows why, and they just start shooting people.
[00:44:01.744 --> 00:44:04.566]  Because they have flashbacks.
[00:44:04.566 --> 00:44:11.550]  I've had family that came back from Vietnam, and for two years after, there'd be a backfire on the street, they'd jump under the table.
[00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:14.733]  Because, you know, they'd been at bases with mortar attacks.
[00:44:14.733 --> 00:44:16.734]  I mean, this is just what happens.
[00:44:16.734 --> 00:44:20.837]  And so we're gonna have a giant police force made up of military, but then it gets worse.
[00:44:22.346 --> 00:44:30.234]  For at least a decade they've been testing amphetamines, amnesiacs, steroids, aggression drugs on the troops.
[00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:35.399]  They have got them so hopped up on drugs it would make your head spin.
[00:44:35.399 --> 00:44:40.143]  They're giving them experimental malaria drugs that admittedly cause psychotic breaks.
[00:44:40.143 --> 00:44:41.625]  Then when they get home and are depressed,
[00:44:42.469 --> 00:44:44.711]  They give them, what do they give them?
[00:44:44.711 --> 00:44:46.092]  Prozac type drugs.
[00:44:46.092 --> 00:44:50.196]  On their own insert, it says causes psychotic breaks, psychotic behavior.
[00:44:50.196 --> 00:44:54.079]  You give a battle-hardened killer, and that's what they are.
[00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:55.440]  They're killers.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.902]  They're trained killers.
[00:44:57.902 --> 00:45:03.167]  They're trained to kill people, to blow things up, to burn things.
[00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:04.968]  The army admits.
[00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:08.872]  They have troops in Afghanistan and Iraq where they go in villages and kill everyone.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.020]  Kill everyone!
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.541]  And now they're going to come back here!
[00:45:15.541 --> 00:45:20.462]  And they're going to kill people!
[00:45:20.462 --> 00:45:21.882]  We'll get to that shady news a little bit later.
[00:45:21.882 --> 00:45:23.062]  I'm going to continue with calls here.
[00:45:23.062 --> 00:45:25.603]  Let's go to, let's go to Johnny in Kansas.
[00:45:25.603 --> 00:45:26.263]  You're on the air.
[00:45:26.263 --> 00:45:27.563]  Welcome.
[00:45:27.563 --> 00:45:28.523]  Hey, Alex.
[00:45:28.523 --> 00:45:29.584]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:29.584 --> 00:45:31.844]  You're doing a fantastic job, man.
[00:45:31.844 --> 00:45:35.825]  I mean, I've been listening to you since about 99.
[00:45:35.825 --> 00:45:37.365]  And I used to try to get on your show
[00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:42.570]  And it was a challenge at best.
[00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:43.351]  Well, good to have you here.
[00:45:43.351 --> 00:45:44.071]  What's on your mind?
[00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:47.452]  Sorry about that.
[00:45:47.452 --> 00:45:50.053]  Uh, hey, uh, got a couple of things here.
[00:45:50.053 --> 00:45:53.074]  We just had a vet that's supposed to have went off here.
[00:45:53.074 --> 00:45:56.375]  And I think he started at Oklahoma.
[00:45:56.375 --> 00:46:04.437]  And according to the stories on the news, he raped a 12 or 13 year old girl and then beeline to Texas.
[00:46:04.437 --> 00:46:05.098]  Have you heard about that?
[00:46:05.098 --> 00:46:05.918]  They just caught him.
[00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:11.084]  No, but I see articles every day about vets going crazy.
[00:46:11.084 --> 00:46:18.776]  This one here, as it laid out in front of me, it struck me that this guy kind of sounds like a psy-op.
[00:46:20.157 --> 00:46:21.458]  Oh, you know that's going to happen.
[00:46:21.458 --> 00:46:32.907]  It's a shy-op to advertise first behind the scenes and now publicly that vets are going to start IEDing, improvised explosive devising, every police department in the country.
[00:46:32.907 --> 00:46:35.189]  They tell cops, vets will attack you.
[00:46:35.189 --> 00:46:44.256]  Now they advertise it so unstable people, and the system knows exactly what they're doing, are going to hear that and think, I won't go shoot up my family.
[00:46:45.877 --> 00:46:48.338]  I'll bomb someone!
[00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:50.538]  And so they're advertising it.
[00:46:50.538 --> 00:46:56.860]  Again, every time somebody jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge and they advertise it, other copycatters rush to do it.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:09.464]  Every time somebody climbs the enclosures at major high-rises in Chicago, New York, or LA and jumps off, cops are stationed for the next two days because crazies see it on the news and go, I'm gonna do that!
[00:47:09.464 --> 00:47:12.805]  And that's why, when this country's faced real terrorism in the 60s and 70s,
[00:47:14.105 --> 00:47:16.066]  Some of it's Soviet funded.
[00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:18.628]  They would not give it attention in the news.
[00:47:18.628 --> 00:47:24.752]  When real terrorism is ignored, only fake terrorism is promoted.
[00:47:24.752 --> 00:47:25.913]  Go ahead.
[00:47:25.913 --> 00:47:28.194]  Let's get on to some national terrorism.
[00:47:28.194 --> 00:47:29.956]  What, the earthquake and the hurricane?
[00:47:29.956 --> 00:47:31.056]  Yes.
[00:47:31.056 --> 00:47:31.917]  Alright.
[00:47:31.917 --> 00:47:36.520]  Have you heard that they've got evidence that the earthquake was a nuclear detonation underground?
[00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:54.847]  I know that there's underground areas in Colorado and D.C., and I know that scientists have said it was highly unusual in both places, but particularly in Virginia and D.C., and I know that they have these type of systems, but I don't think there's any evidence to the fact that I've seen.
[00:47:54.847 --> 00:47:58.508]  I mean, I've seen the sites that always speculate.
[00:47:58.508 --> 00:48:05.250]  We had some information come out of Canada that had the actual, supposedly had the actual seismology graph.
[00:48:06.078 --> 00:48:09.519]  It showed the earthquake and there was no buildup like a natural hurricane.
[00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:10.500]  No, no, I did see that.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:15.662]  Even the Washington Post said there wasn't a buildup and there wasn't plates in that area.
[00:48:15.662 --> 00:48:17.262]  It's very unusual.
[00:48:17.262 --> 00:48:18.283]  Very suspicious.
[00:48:18.283 --> 00:48:23.825]  And that's why I read the New York Times admitting that you can create earthquakes with explosives.
[00:48:24.645 --> 00:48:33.472]  They can drill, pump the explosives in, detonate them, if they have the computer maps of the seismology, if they detonate it right in the key area.
[00:48:33.472 --> 00:48:34.632]  I appreciate your call.
[00:48:34.632 --> 00:48:35.753]  Interesting points.
[00:48:35.753 --> 00:48:37.374]  Good to hear from you, Tim.
[00:48:37.374 --> 00:48:43.479]  Let's go now to Tina in Indiana.
[00:48:43.479 --> 00:48:44.079]  You're on the air.
[00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:44.460]  Go ahead.
[00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:49.813]  Hi Alex, it's actually Teenie, but that's okay.
[00:48:49.813 --> 00:48:56.177]  I wanted to ask, did you know anything about the pharmacist giving out flu shots?
[00:48:56.177 --> 00:48:59.299]  That it's mandatory for them to do that?
[00:48:59.299 --> 00:49:03.182]  And they also, they have to have a quota that they gotta meet for these flu shots?
[00:49:03.783 --> 00:49:21.450]  Well, I know they admit now there's quotas for cops to give tickets and generate revenue, and I know that they do tell at some of the big chains, because I've been sent the memos on it by pharmacists, that it's their job to basically push flu vaccines, just like businesses push a customer loyalty card.
[00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:28.453]  And I know that I've gone to get a prescription filled and had them push it on me, so I start preaching at them.
[00:49:28.453 --> 00:49:31.895]  And I know that they are trying to order pharmacists and medical workers
[00:49:33.359 --> 00:49:43.587]  To take vaccines to be able to work in the medical field, but lawsuits have borne out that that's unlawful and uncivil and you can lose a lawsuit.
[00:49:43.587 --> 00:49:52.495]  So yeah, they try to bushwhack and bamboozle doctors, nurses, janitors in hospitals.
[00:49:53.697 --> 00:49:57.019]  Pharmacist to take vaccines.
[00:49:57.019 --> 00:50:01.922]  But the last H1N1 shot they admitted doubles your chances of getting the regular flu.
[00:50:01.922 --> 00:50:05.284]  I mean, that's the Canadian government admits that as a dangerous vaccine.
[00:50:05.284 --> 00:50:07.826]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:50:07.826 --> 00:50:09.087]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:09.087 --> 00:50:13.710]  A pharmacist, because I was talking to her about it, and I had mentioned to her, I said,
[00:50:14.455 --> 00:50:18.559]  Don't you know that your flu shots have mercury in them?
[00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:23.164]  And they're going, oh yeah, we know, but it's just such a low dose that even pregnant people can take it.
[00:50:23.164 --> 00:50:24.285]  And I'm going, oh my God.
[00:50:24.793 --> 00:50:35.436]  Yeah, you know, until two years ago, in every medical manual worldwide, in fact, we posted an article by a doctor last week about this, it said, do not give a vaccine to a pregnant woman.
[00:50:35.436 --> 00:50:42.657]  Not just the mercury, but the autoimmune response can cause an abortion, a miscarriage.
[00:50:42.657 --> 00:50:45.678]  And now they say it's good for pregnant women to take them.
[00:50:46.909 --> 00:50:50.172]  Just like Rick Perry says, you know, take this Gardasil shot.
[00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:53.816]  It'll maim you or kill you, but hey, take it.
[00:50:53.816 --> 00:50:54.217]  Stay there.
[00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:58.181]  I want to hear more of what your pharmacist friend told you on the other side.
[00:50:58.181 --> 00:50:59.442]  I'm going to go to other calls.
[00:50:59.442 --> 00:50:59.842]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.819 --> 00:51:06.040]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:12.648 --> 00:52:16.751]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:52:17.111 --> 00:52:19.853]  But we can't do that without your help.

[00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:40.766]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:52:40.766 --> 00:52:50.649]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:52:50.649 --> 00:52:52.149]  The war is here.
[00:52:52.149 --> 00:52:54.050]  It's an info war.
[00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:56.790]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:53:00.251 --> 00:53:06.634]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[00:53:06.634 --> 00:53:07.654]  That's easy, Bill.
[00:53:07.654 --> 00:53:11.776]  I'd head straight to SoupBeanSurvival.com.
[00:53:11.776 --> 00:53:13.297]  SoupBeanSurvival.com?
[00:53:13.297 --> 00:53:23.441]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[00:53:23.441 --> 00:53:24.061]  Really, Brian?
[00:53:24.061 --> 00:53:26.062]  The number one survival food?
[00:53:26.062 --> 00:53:27.943]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[00:53:28.183 --> 00:53:29.204]  Absolutely, Bill.
[00:53:29.204 --> 00:53:40.634]  The folks at SoupBeanSurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[00:53:40.634 --> 00:53:42.776]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[00:53:42.776 --> 00:53:43.657]  No way, Bill.
[00:53:43.657 --> 00:53:46.319]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[00:53:46.319 --> 00:53:46.800]  These are the
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:47.601]  Absolutely.
[00:54:12.188 --> 00:54:16.073]  On the soldier issue, you reap what you sow.
[00:54:16.073 --> 00:54:22.101]  You train millions of young men in the last decade how to kill.
[00:54:22.101 --> 00:54:29.009]  You send them into third world hell holes to kill, to torture, to grow opium fields.
[00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:36.529]  And when they come home, the system is going to use their rapine to take everybody's liberties.
[00:54:36.529 --> 00:54:46.933]  On one end, they're going to make them cops to use against the public, and on the other hand, use those that aren't police as a pretext to sick the paramilitary police on us all.
[00:54:46.933 --> 00:54:51.195]  This is the tale of the New World Order Problem Reaction Solution System.
[00:54:51.195 --> 00:54:58.898]  I'm going to go back to Teenie in Indiana and then to Tim and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:55:01.704 --> 00:55:08.106]  I want to remind listeners that we are launching the new TV show every weeknight, 7 p.m.
[00:55:08.106 --> 00:55:16.468]  It will stream to you at PrisonPlanet.tv and we're going to have special reports many nights of the week that expand the show.
[00:55:16.468 --> 00:55:20.469]  We're going to premiere documentaries at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:20.469 --> 00:55:23.009]  We are upping the fight against the globalists.
[00:55:23.009 --> 00:55:25.030]  We've hired reporters.
[00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:28.991]  We are just really intensifying what we're doing because if not us, who?
[00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:39.136]  And this is going to allow us to focus and condense the information so that it's absolutely effective when you pass it on to others.
[00:55:39.136 --> 00:55:44.920]  We're going to have functions with the newscast where if you're a member, you can download it and then send it to a friend.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:53.827]  So if you're not a PrisonPlanet.TV member, please become one today and your membership supports and funds our critical operations.
[00:55:53.827 --> 00:55:54.587]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:55:57.798 --> 00:56:01.125]  Let's go back to Tini in Indiana.
[00:56:01.125 --> 00:56:04.392]  So, briefly, what did the pharmacist tell you?
[00:56:05.185 --> 00:56:12.511]  Well, she just basically told me that mercury, you know, it was such a low dose in there that it's not harmful.
[00:56:12.511 --> 00:56:16.714]  And, you know, after I heard that, I just couldn't think anymore, you know?
[00:56:16.714 --> 00:56:22.419]  And when they tell her she has to take it to have her job, she doesn't ask to see the law or ask to see the regulation?
[00:56:22.419 --> 00:56:29.244]  I, well, see, the thing is, is I worked at that pharmacy with the pharmacist that I spoke with.
[00:56:29.244 --> 00:56:30.205]  I worked there.
[00:56:30.205 --> 00:56:32.627]  And let me tell you, I'm 53 years old.
[00:56:34.574 --> 00:56:38.056]  The last time I went to the doctor was the day my daughter was born.
[00:56:38.056 --> 00:56:40.177]  She's 32 years old.
[00:56:40.177 --> 00:56:41.618]  I'm healthy.
[00:56:41.618 --> 00:56:44.200]  I don't need to go to the doctor and get all these medications.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:50.343]  And when I started working at the pharmacy, I said to myself, now I know why I don't go to the doctor.
[00:56:50.343 --> 00:56:57.847]  You know, because I don't want them to prescribe me for things that... Every week, people that I've known for years, I hear that they've died.
[00:56:57.847 --> 00:56:59.929]  And it's always when they go in,
[00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:06.033]  For a spider bite that's gotten well, but the doctor wants to cut it out.
[00:57:06.033 --> 00:57:10.295]  Or it's when they go in to have a hernia fix and they die of flesh-eating bacteria.
[00:57:10.295 --> 00:57:16.179]  I mean, I have lost so many friends and acquaintances who go in totally healthy and are killed in the hospital.
[00:57:16.179 --> 00:57:22.743]  And the government even admits 350,000 people die from negligent complications.
[00:57:22.743 --> 00:57:25.505]  300 plus thousand die from drug interactions.
[00:57:26.025 --> 00:57:29.126]  I mean, the most dangerous thing in America are the hospitals.
[00:57:29.126 --> 00:57:34.447]  I'm not saying that hospitals aren't great for trauma, like a broken leg or a car wreck.
[00:57:34.447 --> 00:57:35.947]  And there are a lot of great doctors.
[00:57:35.947 --> 00:57:39.188]  But there's also a lot of doctors who shouldn't be doctors.
[00:57:39.188 --> 00:57:40.848]  And it's only getting worse.
[00:57:40.848 --> 00:57:45.369]  I mean, I stay away from the hospital like the plague.
[00:57:45.369 --> 00:57:46.369]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:46.369 --> 00:57:50.490]  Let's go to... I don't want to cut this caller short, but we'll see here.
[00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:51.630]  Let's talk to Tim in Utah.
[00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:52.291]  Tim, you're on the air.
[00:57:52.291 --> 00:57:54.011]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:54.011 --> 00:57:54.271]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:58.412]  Hey, I appreciate your 70s bumper music.
[00:57:58.412 --> 00:58:00.273]  You bet!
[00:58:00.273 --> 00:58:02.235]  I got a couple questions.
[00:58:02.235 --> 00:58:13.462]  I've been studying the fascist globalist control freaks for about 20 years and a couple weeks ago you were talking about suppressed high-tech that they've been developing, you know, for the last few decades.
[00:58:13.462 --> 00:58:17.905]  Why do you think they never really roll that stuff out to scare the heck out of people?
[00:58:17.905 --> 00:58:24.430]  They just like play with it a little bit here and there but they don't really take advantage of all that technology that they've been developing.
[00:58:26.343 --> 00:58:35.791]  Does it just seem like there's something else going on in their heads that they don't want to use that kind of stuff to scare people but they're pulled back for some reason?
[00:58:35.791 --> 00:58:43.638]  Let me try to answer the question when we come back in the second hour.
[00:58:43.638 --> 00:58:47.402]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.772 --> 00:58:53.494]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.494 --> 00:58:58.799]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:00.341]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.341 --> 00:59:09.129]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:17.395]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.395 --> 00:59:25.400]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:32.804]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:00:05.407 --> 01:00:10.251]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:11.833]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:13.374]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.374 --> 01:00:17.578]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.578 --> 01:00:27.766]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.766 --> 01:00:29.988]  We are now into our number two.
[01:00:29.988 --> 01:00:32.530]  I'm gonna get into some important medical news.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:44.125]  Military Libya News, CIA militarized actions in Somalia and other areas coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:44.125 --> 01:00:53.789]  Then we'll continue with your phone calls all the way into the third hour when we are joined by Mike Adams with some breaking news coming up again in the third hour, the last hour today.
[01:00:54.878 --> 01:01:04.841]  But Tim in Utah, if you just joined us, asked a very sophisticated question that would really take a dissertation to try to answer properly.
[01:01:04.841 --> 01:01:11.523]  But I'll try to be succinct and then get his take on it.
[01:01:11.523 --> 01:01:19.046]  The military industrial complex has developed with their unlimited trillions of U.S.
[01:01:19.046 --> 01:01:22.887]  taxpayer money, a lot of super science.
[01:01:24.209 --> 01:01:27.292]  They use a science fiction term.
[01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:30.014]  They created artificial suns 30 years ago.
[01:01:30.014 --> 01:01:33.036]  They created black holes 20 years ago.
[01:01:33.036 --> 01:01:37.220]  They're always announcing, Japanese for the first time make a black hole, you know, three years ago.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:43.345]  And I can go pull up the DARPA test decades ago.
[01:01:43.345 --> 01:01:48.369]  They have done incredible things in cyclotrons and superconducting super colliders.
[01:01:48.369 --> 01:01:49.450]  There has been a 60 year deep
[01:01:51.533 --> 01:01:54.794]  Base program that's admitted but the details aren't known.
[01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:59.675]  I've gotten some pieces of that from military personnel and others.
[01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:05.777]  It's very credible.
[01:02:05.777 --> 01:02:08.838]  The point is there's a lot going on we don't know.
[01:02:08.838 --> 01:02:14.480]  But we have examples of the SR-71 Blackbird in service in the mid-50s.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.121]  They're saying it's the fastest plane in the world still today.
[01:02:17.121 --> 01:02:18.141]  Does anyone really believe that?
[01:02:18.942 --> 01:02:25.445]  Twenty years after they say they had it, in the late 80s they unveiled the B-2 bomber.
[01:02:25.445 --> 01:02:28.266]  You see the stealth helicopter crash.
[01:02:28.266 --> 01:02:32.727]  My military sources say that's three generations ago, or 30 years ago.
[01:02:32.727 --> 01:02:36.409]  That's a very old helicopter that crashed there in the fake Bin Laden raid.
[01:02:41.055 --> 01:02:47.960]  What's happening is the globalists want a world government, they say, to keep dangerous technologies from getting out of the wrong hands.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:57.907]  They want a global tyranny, they say, to stop other rogue nations from developing the systems they've already discovered.
[01:02:57.907 --> 01:03:06.873]  And so, they don't want to let the public understand all the developments and technologies that they've discovered, but haven't yet absolutely mastered.
[01:03:08.442 --> 01:03:09.602]  They can extend life.
[01:03:09.602 --> 01:03:12.903]  Normally you die in one year of cancer of the pancreas.
[01:03:12.903 --> 01:03:14.024]  Steve Jobs almost ate.
[01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:19.665]  You know, the globalists don't control the world yet.
[01:03:19.665 --> 01:03:20.746]  They're able to steer it.
[01:03:20.746 --> 01:03:22.226]  They're able to dominate it.
[01:03:22.226 --> 01:03:23.787]  But not control it.
[01:03:23.787 --> 01:03:25.547]  Not a hundred percent.
[01:03:25.547 --> 01:03:27.468]  They're able to play different groups off against each other.
[01:03:27.468 --> 01:03:30.589]  They're able to flip sides.
[01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.829]  So...
[01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:48.004]  They haven't rolled out the technologies because they want to have a limited dole out of the technology so they can control it and master it and then sell the last generation to their enemies to entice them into war and war with their neighbors.
[01:03:48.004 --> 01:04:00.795]  But they don't want to roll out the super systems because then if those get in other people's hands down the road, because once you roll them out, they invariably get sold in the black market, then they've got to deal with that problem.
[01:04:01.923 --> 01:04:04.825]  But more and more, they are starting to come out with it.
[01:04:04.825 --> 01:04:08.348]  But, you know, they said by 2012 they want half the Air Force to be drone.
[01:04:08.348 --> 01:04:09.668]  They're well in line to do it.
[01:04:09.668 --> 01:04:13.931]  By 2020, almost the entire Air Force, except troop carriers, will be robot.
[01:04:13.931 --> 01:04:16.633]  And they'll be controlled by robots, not by humans.
[01:04:16.633 --> 01:04:22.798]  The mission will be programmed, it'll be given by a human, but then the machines will carry out most of the decisions.
[01:04:22.798 --> 01:04:26.440]  And that's the big holy grail that the system is looking for.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.101]  They're looking
[01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:31.562]  To completely take humans out of the equation.
[01:04:31.562 --> 01:04:38.205]  So I'll come back and get your take on that, Tim, and get into some other super technologies as well that they test on the public.
[01:04:38.205 --> 01:04:50.651]  They test all this medical stuff on us, and then what works is circuited away, not approved, and kept at special research government facilities, and then doled out to Steve Jobs.
[01:04:50.651 --> 01:04:56.414]  I mean, he got something 99% fatal in a year, two years, and he's lived almost eight.
[01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:57.495]  So there's your life extension.
[01:04:58.564 --> 01:05:00.705]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.705 --> 01:05:04.946]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:05:04.946 --> 01:05:06.207]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:06.207 --> 01:05:09.788]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.788 --> 01:05:12.349]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:18.231]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:05:18.231 --> 01:05:24.453]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.893 --> 01:05:30.857]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.857 --> 01:05:35.060]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:39.343]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:39.343 --> 01:05:45.287]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:45.287 --> 01:05:48.850]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:50.831]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:51.272]  It's here.

[01:07:01.661 --> 01:07:06.345]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:07:06.345 --> 01:07:12.792]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:07:12.792 --> 01:07:15.054]  Number one, study the past.
[01:07:15.054 --> 01:07:17.456]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:07:17.456 --> 01:07:21.179]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:07:22.307 --> 01:07:25.388]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:07:25.388 --> 01:07:29.229]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:07:29.229 --> 01:07:34.271]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:07:34.271 --> 01:07:37.692]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:07:38.272 --> 01:07:41.694]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:07:41.694 --> 01:07:46.178]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.

[01:08:06.237 --> 01:08:08.379]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:29.454 --> 01:08:39.919]  Tim in Utah asked the question, why is DARPA and the Pentagon suppressing so many of the technologies they developed decades ago?
[01:08:39.919 --> 01:08:41.860]  And we know that they do do that.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:43.781]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:08:43.781 --> 01:08:50.465]  There's a lot of reasons, but they want to have the sneak attack capability on the few enemies they've got left.
[01:08:50.465 --> 01:08:56.748]  They also like to keep large areas of what's happening secret from the American people.
[01:08:57.881 --> 01:09:07.989]  That's why since 1947, the CIA and 14 other intelligence agencies have been able to operate separately from the government and do whatever they want.
[01:09:07.989 --> 01:09:18.438]  And now the Federal Reserve can get up on Laird NewsHour and that famous clip from a few years ago with Alan Greenspan and say, we are above the law.
[01:09:18.438 --> 01:09:19.699]  Congress can say nothing.
[01:09:19.699 --> 01:09:22.041]  They have no jurisdiction over us.
[01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:24.203]  What an incredible, arrogant statement.
[01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:29.105]  So, we haven't been a free country for a very, very long time.
[01:09:29.105 --> 01:09:49.097]  They let us gripe and complain down here at the grassroots level, but they have built behind government and corporate reservation walls, in their laboratories, in their bunkers, a lot of secret technologies, both nuclear, dealing with fission,
[01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:54.243]  Communications, weaponry, genetic engineering.
[01:09:54.243 --> 01:09:55.684]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:09:55.684 --> 01:10:00.067]  A few months ago, the BBC and others came out and said, oh, yes.
[01:10:00.067 --> 01:10:06.351]  One company in England, with the government's knowledge, has made hundreds of human-animal clone splices.
[01:10:06.351 --> 01:10:10.474]  But don't worry, we kill them before the embryos grow up to be too big.
[01:10:10.474 --> 01:10:13.336]  And this was just kept from the public because it might have upset people.
[01:10:14.158 --> 01:10:18.160]  Well, I read the exact same type of articles in 1996.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:24.602]  Yes, we cloned humans and spliced them with animals many years ago, but we're just now telling you about it.
[01:10:24.602 --> 01:10:27.043]  It's always the same playbooks.
[01:10:27.043 --> 01:10:41.609]  I saw a YouTube video last week, I meant to play it here, where it showed Barack Obama side-by-side at the podium saying the exact words in the exact order of Jimmy Carter.
[01:10:43.186 --> 01:10:49.192]  They just changed the date and changed a few little points.
[01:10:49.192 --> 01:10:52.295]  And it was amazing.
[01:10:52.295 --> 01:10:54.357]  It was absolutely amazing.
[01:10:54.357 --> 01:10:56.058]  And it's like, but Jimmy Carter failed.
[01:10:56.058 --> 01:10:57.219]  Jimmy Carter was a failure.
[01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:59.421]  No, he was a success.
[01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.744]  He was meant to take the blame for everything that happened.
[01:11:02.523 --> 01:11:07.427]  He was meant to be an interim candidate to then bring in Ronald Reagan as the savior.
[01:11:07.427 --> 01:11:11.871]  Just like Rick Perry has been prepared and now billed as the next Ronald Reagan.
[01:11:11.871 --> 01:11:19.737]  I told you he will run, he'll have a fake pledge, and he's probably going to get Sarah Palin on his ticket later.
[01:11:19.737 --> 01:11:22.259]  And I told you he'll be billed as Ronald Reagan.
[01:11:22.259 --> 01:11:23.340]  I'm on record!
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:29.585]  Two years ago, a year ago, six months ago, with absolute precision.
[01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:30.326]  Now why is that?
[01:11:31.678 --> 01:11:34.059]  A, I have sources.
[01:11:34.059 --> 01:11:38.640]  B, I've learned the globalist modus operandi.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:44.321]  They do the same stuff over and over again with only slight variations.
[01:11:44.321 --> 01:11:56.104]  If something has worked for them before, they will follow a pattern and then use the same script.
[01:11:56.104 --> 01:11:57.044]  They know what they're doing.
[01:11:58.322 --> 01:12:03.909]  But once you're aware of the playbook, you're like, how dumb am I not to understand that?
[01:12:03.909 --> 01:12:05.451]  It's a play.
[01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:07.233]  It's a scam.
[01:12:07.233 --> 01:12:09.095]  The whole world is a stage, each of us.
[01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:11.894]  Actors upon it.
[01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:12.854]  As Shakespeare said.
[01:12:12.854 --> 01:12:16.136]  Well, I'm not a actor in their system.
[01:12:16.136 --> 01:12:19.817]  I see it for the amusement park it is.
[01:12:19.817 --> 01:12:21.598]  And I'm outside the amusement park.
[01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:23.859]  I'm trying to live in the real world.
[01:12:23.859 --> 01:12:25.720]  We all look through rose-colored glasses.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:32.643]  All of us distort reality from one way or another because we have limited information and can't see over the horizon.
[01:12:32.643 --> 01:12:34.163]  But I live in the real world.
[01:12:34.163 --> 01:12:39.746]  I read the globalist policy reports that they're so arrogant they put out publicly thinking you're not going to read them.
[01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:50.677]  And so they've created these high-tech reservations, and they only dole stuff out generally when it's 30 years old.
[01:12:50.677 --> 01:13:03.880]  I mean, my dad remembers being in college in the 60s, and CD-ROM, and how they were going to have touchscreens, and how everything was going to work, and then they claim Bill Gates, and all these people come out with it.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.821]  I've seen countless science fiction movies.
[01:13:08.803 --> 01:13:14.867]  Where you'll see him walking around with what looks like an iPad doing things on it from 30 years ago.
[01:13:14.867 --> 01:13:17.088]  That's all predictive programming.
[01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:19.230]  They go to Hollywood and they say, put this in your film.
[01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:25.214]  You know, they go to a MIT advisor that tells them as a consultant and they pay him, what should I put in here?
[01:13:25.214 --> 01:13:27.615]  Well, this is what's going to be in the future.
[01:13:27.615 --> 01:13:37.381]  Just like the CIA went to Fox and said, we want you to put a plane flying into the World Trade Center to be blamed on Afghanistan, but really it's the government doing it and it's a drill.
[01:13:37.381 --> 01:13:38.142]  So they stand down.
[01:13:39.656 --> 01:13:42.659]  And then the exact same thing is done six months later.
[01:13:42.659 --> 01:13:50.086]  They understand your brain only gets shocked by what it's never experienced.
[01:13:50.086 --> 01:13:52.789]  How do you domesticate a horse?
[01:13:52.789 --> 01:13:56.252]  You get out and you walk around him for a few weeks.
[01:13:56.252 --> 01:13:57.593]  You bring him food.
[01:13:57.593 --> 01:14:00.816]  You feed him carrots.
[01:14:00.816 --> 01:14:03.179]  You train him to let you pet him.
[01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:20.534]  And the way ancients did it with pure wild horses is they would then pin the horses, and when a baby was born, they would domesticate that baby and train it, and then they would breed it with other horses that had been domesticated.
[01:14:20.534 --> 01:14:22.316]  They would eat.
[01:14:22.316 --> 01:14:28.180]  If you dig into any ancient mound, especially the Romans and others, you'll find a lot of horse bones.
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:31.082]  A horse was actually seen as more tasty by the Romans.
[01:14:32.403 --> 01:14:41.066]  Then even cattle, beef, and the horses that were spirited, horses that were aggressive, they just ate them.
[01:14:41.066 --> 01:14:49.369]  Just like dogs that were not the right shape or size, whatever they were breeding them for, you would just throw them in the river.
[01:14:49.369 --> 01:14:53.290]  Break their neck, throw them in the river, put them in a cage, throw them in the river.
[01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:56.951]  Or if you were hungry, you'd knock them on the head and roast them.
[01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.872]  All the European dig sites, they find dog.
[01:15:00.776 --> 01:15:05.399]  What do you think Roman legions ate when they ran out of horses?
[01:15:05.399 --> 01:15:07.480]  They ate everything, including rats.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:13.364]  The Romans carried, actually, mice in big urns that they fed trash to.
[01:15:13.364 --> 01:15:19.527]  And then they would roast mice.
[01:15:19.527 --> 01:15:20.448]  But I now digress.
[01:15:22.579 --> 01:15:28.081]  And I want to go back to your calls and some other news, but they don't want to roll out the technologies.
[01:15:28.081 --> 01:15:43.526]  They want to keep them behind a national security reservation while they grow and develop those systems so that any other country or region or company or individual can't see the technology in action and then try to reverse engineer it.
[01:15:43.526 --> 01:15:48.547]  They want to build these systems in secret and then roll them out later if they need them.
[01:15:48.547 --> 01:15:49.848]  Does that answer your question, Tim?
[01:15:50.885 --> 01:16:02.032]  Yeah, I worked at Area 52 in Nevada about in the early 90s, and the rumors were that there was Star Trek type technology that was being suppressed.
[01:16:02.032 --> 01:16:06.556]  I think I saw the Aurora in the 70s actually fly over my head one night.
[01:16:06.556 --> 01:16:08.997]  Area 51 or 52?
[01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:09.558]  I worked at 52.
[01:16:09.558 --> 01:16:10.378]  I was right next to 51.
[01:16:10.378 --> 01:16:13.300]  And of course there would be lots of rumors flying around about what was going on at 51.
[01:16:21.787 --> 01:16:27.690]  And, uh, you know, like I said, it was Star Trek type technology, holographic technology, and all kinds of things that they were.
[01:16:27.690 --> 01:16:34.632]  Well, we know they've got that and have been testing it where they can project flying saucers, Buddha, Muhammad, Christ, wherever they want.
[01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:36.653]  That much has been admitted.
[01:16:36.653 --> 01:16:42.876]  And now we have the New York Times and others calling for a fake alien invasion to unify the world.
[01:16:42.876 --> 01:16:44.717]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[01:16:44.717 --> 01:16:50.319]  And see, that's a big top media guy, a script writer, telling the rest of the media, uh, get ready.
[01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:53.844]  Uh, for fake alien stuff.
[01:16:53.844 --> 01:16:57.466]  So that's definitely... What else did you, uh, learn?
[01:16:57.466 --> 01:17:07.692]  Well, there was, you know, it was during the time when, uh, what was the book, uh, Behold the Pale Horse was out and all that kind of questionable alien stuff.
[01:17:07.692 --> 01:17:11.134]  But I always thought it was just the government creating all that type of thing.
[01:17:11.134 --> 01:17:18.519]  The, you know, anti-gravity type stuff or, uh, where I was specifically, we didn't have super high tech.
[01:17:18.519 --> 01:17:18.879]  We had like,
[01:17:19.884 --> 01:17:21.904]  Hand Geometry Readers and that kind of thing.
[01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:23.805]  The Stealth Fighters were there.
[01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:29.586]  But, uh, you know, the big stuff, the really cool stuff was at 51, according to all the rumors.
[01:17:29.586 --> 01:17:43.008]  But, one thing I've been wondering is, is there almost a religious reason, I hate to use the word religion, but a religious reason why the Control Freaks don't bring all this stuff out, because there's essentially three stages of Control Freaks.
[01:17:43.008 --> 01:17:46.289]  There's the manipulation, intimidation, and then outright force.
[01:17:47.493 --> 01:17:53.156]  And it seems like they're almost trying to get us to do what they want us to do without taking it to the limit.
[01:17:53.156 --> 01:17:56.357]  You know, just using manipulation, a little bit of intimidation here and there.
[01:17:56.357 --> 01:17:57.157]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:17:57.157 --> 01:18:05.781]  Once they started keeping technology secret, when they trot them out, people go, you mean there's a secret government?
[01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:06.241]  Right.
[01:18:06.241 --> 01:18:07.462]  I mean, that's the thing.
[01:18:07.462 --> 01:18:09.723]  You realize there's something going on underneath it all.
[01:18:10.635 --> 01:18:16.079]  But the average Joe just reading the paper, watching TV, doesn't understand what's going on.
[01:18:16.079 --> 01:18:17.441]  And what was the name of the base?
[01:18:17.441 --> 01:18:19.102]  It was Tonopah?
[01:18:19.102 --> 01:18:21.324]  Tonopah Test Range.
[01:18:21.324 --> 01:18:22.525]  Right.
[01:18:22.525 --> 01:18:26.087]  And closed down in, quote unquote, closed down in 92.
[01:18:26.087 --> 01:18:28.590]  So, there's still stuff I'm sure going on.
[01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:32.893]  Well, what did the guys on the base say they heard was at 51?
[01:18:32.893 --> 01:18:38.878]  Well, besides the, you know, the flying stuff, and I had seen the flying stuff at night.
[01:18:39.537 --> 01:18:42.758]  Oh no, that's what I've been told by insiders, is there's nothing alien.
[01:18:42.758 --> 01:18:55.442]  They've got auroras, big troop carrying, flying V's, which they now are basically admitting to the public they have, and big projector systems for holograms and bio-weapons research underground.
[01:18:55.442 --> 01:19:04.745]  Well, and you can see them flying around at night, and they'd be doing like, you know, 90 degree turns, you know, no problem at all.
[01:19:04.745 --> 01:19:07.886]  You know, and I saw one night, there was like 15 or 20 of them out in the air.
[01:19:08.675 --> 01:19:11.917]  And they were just shooting around, dancing almost, around each other.
[01:19:11.917 --> 01:19:13.058]  You know what, this is too important.
[01:19:13.058 --> 01:19:14.459]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:19.603]  Will you do five more minutes on the other side and I'll give you the floor to tell folks these stories?
[01:19:19.603 --> 01:19:20.183]  Sure, no problem.
[01:19:20.183 --> 01:19:28.109]  I'm going to put you on hold because we're going to break, but my dad wished that he'd have brought his telescope because he's got a little telescope you can hook a digital camera into.
[01:19:28.849 --> 01:19:30.730]  And we've got incredible footage.
[01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:33.772]  The problem is you can track a planet with the computer system.
[01:19:33.772 --> 01:19:34.913]  It's hard to track a craft.
[01:19:34.913 --> 01:19:37.915]  But I was like, oh, Dad, I want to go to Monument, Utah again.
[01:19:37.915 --> 01:19:39.256]  Monument Valley, like when we were a kid.
[01:19:39.256 --> 01:19:41.597]  He goes, oh, I almost forgot.
[01:19:41.597 --> 01:19:45.000]  He spent like a week and a half in Montana and Utah visiting friends.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.184]  He said he would sit outside at night and watch stuff at high altitude, look like satellite space altitude.
[01:19:52.184 --> 01:19:54.046]  You see satellites in the clear night.
[01:19:54.046 --> 01:19:55.587]  He said they were doing 90 degree turns.
[01:19:57.779 --> 01:19:59.100]  Looked like they were going like 5,000 miles an hour.
[01:20:19.269 --> 01:20:20.570]  Forget loan modification.
[01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:26.935]  Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:20:26.935 --> 01:20:32.380]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:36.683]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[01:20:36.683 --> 01:20:45.090]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:46.791]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[01:20:46.791 --> 01:20:46.891]  800-477-9256.
[01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:47.091]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:20:47.091 --> 01:20:47.792]  Or visit www.zerodet100.com.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:05.241]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:21:05.241 --> 01:21:06.721]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:21:06.721 --> 01:21:15.623]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:21:15.623 --> 01:21:19.064]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:21:19.064 --> 01:21:20.104]  But take heart.
[01:21:20.104 --> 01:21:23.905]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:21:23.905 --> 01:21:28.886]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:21:29.306 --> 01:21:33.149]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:34.871]  The globalists are scared.
[01:21:34.871 --> 01:21:36.212]  They've overreached.

[01:22:31.715 --> 01:22:35.097]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:22:35.097 --> 01:22:43.303]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:22:43.303 --> 01:22:48.606]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[01:22:48.606 --> 01:22:51.588]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:21.763]  We're good to go!
[01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:52.664]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method, which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades.

[01:24:04.788 --> 01:24:05.749]  You know, it's funny.
[01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:10.631]  I was talking about my dad just getting back from vacation in Wyoming and Montana.
[01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:13.452]  Mainly up there looking at fossils and going to dinosaur digs.
[01:24:14.506 --> 01:24:18.713]  And then I go out of the studio and he had dropped some stuff off.
[01:24:18.713 --> 01:24:23.742]  I forgot at his house this weekend when I was over there for my grandmother's birthday.
[01:24:24.898 --> 01:24:26.519]  And so I drug my dad in here.
[01:24:26.519 --> 01:24:27.920]  Now, he didn't want to be on camera.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:28.881]  He didn't want to actually be in there.
[01:24:28.881 --> 01:24:31.863]  I actually physically grabbed him and forced him down in the seat.
[01:24:31.863 --> 01:24:43.291]  And then we're going to come back and go to that caller after the break who can tell us about Area 52 because I'm holding that guy over because everything he's saying is the exact same info I've got from people that were actually at both bases.
[01:24:43.291 --> 01:24:45.132]  But dad, tell us your experiences.
[01:24:45.132 --> 01:24:49.275]  Like once when I was six, seven years old, we were driving back from East Texas on 45.
[01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:58.743]  We looked out the window and flying low were three things that looked like super stealth fighters, but more advanced than anything you've seen today.
[01:24:58.743 --> 01:25:05.609]  Almost like a stealth SR-71, but they were like gray and looked like something out of a science fiction movie.
[01:25:05.609 --> 01:25:15.317]  When you were a kid, you saw the Blackbird there in East Texas, but tell folks about both those experiences, but also what you just saw in Wyoming or was it Montana?
[01:25:15.814 --> 01:25:19.398]  I was in northern Wyoming, not far from Montana.
[01:25:19.398 --> 01:25:22.501]  But in Freestone and Leon County, they used to do a lot of testing.
[01:25:22.501 --> 01:25:25.043]  They would drop chaff out of airplanes and everything.
[01:25:25.043 --> 01:25:36.714]  And one time I was early morning walking up to our school and all of a sudden a Delta winged airplane that was black went over, looked like 50 feet over the building with a sonic boom.
[01:25:37.415 --> 01:25:47.157]  And at that time, I wanted to be the first kid on the moon, and I drew pictures of it, and it literally was the Blackbird, and so Lord knows what they have now.
[01:25:47.157 --> 01:26:00.901]  But we were up and sitting on the second floor porch of a friend's house, and we were talking about satellites and how they moved and everything, and our friend said, well, you know, we watch satellites going across and they'll suddenly make a right angle.
[01:26:01.801 --> 01:26:09.465]  And I was saying, well, if they're at any altitude, that would involve incredible G-forces and just is amazing.
[01:26:09.465 --> 01:26:20.791]  And about that time, we literally saw a satellite that was tracking that looked like it was essentially going to the south, just suddenly turned and went to the... Now, you're a pilot.
[01:26:20.791 --> 01:26:21.271]  You're a pilot.
[01:26:21.271 --> 01:26:22.212]  What type of G's are those?
[01:26:22.532 --> 01:26:23.513]  Well, I have no idea.
[01:26:23.513 --> 01:26:23.993]  It depends.
[01:26:23.993 --> 01:26:30.618]  If it was something small that was real close, it would involve, you know, higher Gs than a pilot could normally tolerate.
[01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:36.422]  And if it were 10,000, 50,000 feet, it would be unimaginable.
[01:26:36.422 --> 01:26:41.106]  And if it were in space, it would be something that's beyond the realm of ordinary physics.
[01:26:41.766 --> 01:26:42.227]  I don't know.
[01:26:59.226 --> 01:27:04.209]  Let me ask you the question that the caller asked, and of course he knew the answer, that's why he's continued it.
[01:27:04.209 --> 01:27:09.092]  He said the control freaks, I don't know if you were listening driving up, the control freaks don't want to use total force yet.
[01:27:09.092 --> 01:27:13.735]  They don't want to show people what they've built because people are going to go, you built this whole thing in secret?
[01:27:13.735 --> 01:27:18.578]  You mean we're living in a kind of frozen technological system where they dole it out?
[01:27:18.578 --> 01:27:20.279]  Why do you think the global controllers
[01:27:21.701 --> 01:27:24.243]  Are keeping most of these technologies secret?
[01:27:24.243 --> 01:27:31.289]  I think the main reason is because things like antibiotics is called what they perceive to be the global population problem.
[01:27:31.289 --> 01:27:36.994]  So new technologies that extend life and prevent death create what to them is a pestilence.
[01:27:36.994 --> 01:27:44.341]  So if you don't control population issues in their mind, it creates things that will poison the planet.
[01:27:44.341 --> 01:27:49.045]  So they probably feel that they need to withhold technologies in order to save the Earth.
[01:27:49.525 --> 01:27:50.445]  Well, that's what they said.
[01:27:50.445 --> 01:27:51.906]  A post-industrial world.
[01:27:51.906 --> 01:27:53.687]  Maury Strong, they've all talked about it.
[01:27:53.687 --> 01:27:54.767]  And they've done a pretty good job.
[01:27:54.767 --> 01:27:56.007]  They're shutting the U.S.
[01:27:56.007 --> 01:28:02.490]  down right now and moving everything to China because China made a deal to reduce their population to be the new king of the hill.
[01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:07.692]  But I will tell you, if you fly around and you go anywhere, the Earth is unimaginably unpopulated.
[01:28:08.982 --> 01:28:12.925]  We are just barely utilizing the potential.
[01:28:12.925 --> 01:28:13.966]  Well, humans are like fish.
[01:28:13.966 --> 01:28:15.948]  We stay in little reef areas.
[01:28:15.948 --> 01:28:17.890]  That's where commerce is.
[01:28:17.890 --> 01:28:23.795]  And so we tend to congregate so people have this false illusion that we're overpopulated.
[01:28:24.295 --> 01:28:29.919]  Well, it's just like people saying that cows are a problem with global warming due to methane.
[01:28:29.919 --> 01:28:35.863]  I think if someone did a study, there's probably less commercial animals alive now than when the buffaloes roamed.
[01:28:35.863 --> 01:28:37.464]  It'd be a very interesting study to do.
[01:28:37.464 --> 01:28:39.205]  I think they've actually done the study.
[01:28:39.205 --> 01:28:42.968]  There were around the same number of buffalo, they believe, than there were cows now.
[01:28:42.968 --> 01:28:43.569]  It doesn't matter.
[01:28:43.569 --> 01:28:46.711]  There's always been creatures running around passing gas.
[01:28:46.711 --> 01:28:51.074]  And they sell us on the fact that we've got to pay Al Gore money or the cow farts are going to kill us.
[01:28:52.182 --> 01:28:54.768]  That sounds ludicrous, but there's truth to it.
[01:28:54.768 --> 01:28:55.710]  No, they passed him!
[01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:56.893]  Flatulence tax in Canada.
[01:29:01.294 --> 01:29:11.157]  What's interesting is where you see most of the animals are actually in population centers because they're extending water into broader sluiceways so they have healthy hay and everything else.
[01:29:11.157 --> 01:29:11.657]  Well, exactly.
[01:29:11.657 --> 01:29:12.137]  Exactly.
[01:29:12.137 --> 01:29:15.358]  Most of the water ends up going in circles.
[01:29:15.358 --> 01:29:17.138]  Only 1% of the water is fresh.
[01:29:17.138 --> 01:29:21.980]  Humans are maximizing that by bringing it to the surface instead of it just going in aquifers into the sea.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:25.841]  And so, where I live in the country, all the animals are coming to my house because we're irrigating.
[01:29:27.082 --> 01:29:28.543]  There's like 50 turkeys in the backyard.
[01:29:28.543 --> 01:29:32.464]  You ought to hear them when he's getting fights over a worm or something.
[01:29:32.464 --> 01:29:34.424]  You ever heard a turkey fight?
[01:29:34.424 --> 01:29:35.745]  Yeah, I have.
[01:29:35.745 --> 01:29:38.406]  Nothing more frightening than a raccoon fight.
[01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:40.386]  That's right, you had a bunch of them breaking your house the other day.
[01:29:40.386 --> 01:29:41.747]  Yes, I had 11 visitors.
[01:29:41.747 --> 01:29:43.908]  Because it's so horrible, you're an evil human.
[01:29:43.908 --> 01:29:45.368]  Dad, I love you.
[01:29:45.368 --> 01:29:46.869]  I'm going to try to give you even more grandkids.
[01:29:46.869 --> 01:29:49.269]  Because it makes the globalists mad.
[01:29:49.269 --> 01:29:50.230]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:51.630]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:53.131]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.162 --> 01:30:01.744]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.744 --> 01:30:17.207]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:17.207 --> 01:30:20.888]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:21.912 --> 01:30:34.682]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:34.682 --> 01:30:41.948]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:42.628 --> 01:30:52.999]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:31:03.544 --> 01:31:08.847]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.847 --> 01:31:10.368]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.368 --> 01:31:19.173]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.893 --> 01:31:27.435]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.435 --> 01:31:35.436]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:32:00.462 --> 01:32:01.642]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:32:01.642 --> 01:32:08.565]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:32:08.565 --> 01:32:11.126]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:11.126 --> 01:32:16.507]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:32:16.507 --> 01:32:19.548]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:19.548 --> 01:32:21.609]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:21.849 --> 01:32:28.113]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:28.113 --> 01:32:31.475]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.475 --> 01:32:37.279]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:37.279 --> 01:32:38.900]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.201]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:40.201 --> 01:32:42.883]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:42.883 --> 01:32:47.105]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:47.105 --> 01:32:48.826]  You can find the video at www.

[01:33:32.461 --> 01:33:35.782]  Okay, Tim in Utah, thanks for holding.
[01:33:35.782 --> 01:33:40.444]  Tell us your stories about Area 52 and some of the things you witnessed.
[01:33:40.444 --> 01:33:40.884]  Go ahead.
[01:33:40.884 --> 01:33:47.648]  Let me start with saying that I saw the V-shaped UFO back in 76 before I even started working.
[01:33:47.648 --> 01:33:52.890]  I was at college doing my astronomy homework and it flew right overhead.
[01:33:52.890 --> 01:33:53.770]  Didn't make a sound.
[01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:57.152]  You know, I looked at my friend that was with me and I was like, did you see that?
[01:33:57.805 --> 01:33:58.326]  He goes, yeah.
[01:33:58.326 --> 01:34:02.309]  And I said, I'm glad because I didn't want to be the only one that saw what happened.
[01:34:02.309 --> 01:34:06.553]  And, uh, you know, from there I always had an interest in UFOs.
[01:34:06.553 --> 01:34:20.245]  And, um, then when I went to work at 52, you know, of course there was lots of rumors, but it's pretty much common knowledge around that area that, you know, on any given night you might see those things flying around.
[01:34:20.245 --> 01:34:24.048]  And, uh, like I say, one night I was out with my son and we were South of Area 51.
[01:34:25.758 --> 01:34:27.740]  And they were dancing in the sky.
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:28.801]  It was incredible.
[01:34:28.801 --> 01:34:34.227]  I had never seen anything like that, as fast as they were and how they could make turns and stuff.
[01:34:34.227 --> 01:34:42.434]  But, you know, most of the stuff I've learned is just from rumors of what other people that have been to 51, you know, had seen.
[01:34:42.434 --> 01:34:44.677]  Well, there's another reason, and I'm glad we're actually
[01:34:46.138 --> 01:34:48.600]  Fleshing this out because it's an important subject.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.681]  It's a core subject.
[01:34:49.681 --> 01:34:50.882]  Very important.
[01:34:50.882 --> 01:34:52.543]  Couldn't be more important.
[01:34:52.543 --> 01:35:09.356]  Another reason I've been told by high-level NASA people and others, and I mean high-level, and also some who worked on the Apollo program, and you can see in the films of the Apollo program, you know, on the front line there in Mission Control, is that there's a secret space program, and that's admitted.
[01:35:09.356 --> 01:35:10.957]  We just don't know the details.
[01:35:10.957 --> 01:35:12.859]  And that the death toll is very high.
[01:35:13.599 --> 01:35:25.184]  And so, they learned that very quickly, watching the astronauts burn to death on the launch pad there at the gantry, that we better keep this experimental stuff secret.
[01:35:25.184 --> 01:35:30.567]  The guys sign up for it, just like Special Forces sign up for it, going behind enemy lines.
[01:35:30.567 --> 01:35:35.609]  And that's what's going on, is that they're trying to keep the casualty numbers secret.
[01:35:35.609 --> 01:35:43.213]  Kind of like what you see in the end of Close Encounters, where all those guys come out and Dreyfus wants to join up with them and stuff, you know.
[01:35:43.592 --> 01:35:48.793]  Because that's stuff that I'm sure isn't, you know, made very public to anyone.
[01:35:48.793 --> 01:35:55.515]  The families are, you know, it was very hush-hush if you worked at 51, which you did, you know.
[01:35:55.515 --> 01:35:56.736]  Who you worked for, exactly.
[01:35:56.736 --> 01:36:07.439]  So you worked at a base with the older secret stuff, but the rumors by the guys on base was the big flying Vs, projection hologram equipment, anything else?
[01:36:07.439 --> 01:36:09.219]  Star Trek technology, that's all they said.
[01:36:09.219 --> 01:36:10.440]  Phasers type stuff.
[01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:15.875]  You know, anything you could see off Star Trek, you know.
[01:36:15.875 --> 01:36:20.837]  And of course there's always been rumors we could fly out to Pluto or something, but I never bought into those particularly.
[01:36:20.837 --> 01:36:24.339]  But, uh, anyway, before I go, do you mind if I plug my website real quick?
[01:36:24.339 --> 01:36:25.400]  Sure, what is it?
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.081]  It's controlfreakyou.com.
[01:36:28.081 --> 01:36:29.902]  I'll have to, I'll have to check that out.
[01:36:29.902 --> 01:36:31.523]  Anything else you forgot to add, Tim?
[01:36:32.208 --> 01:36:34.288]  Oh, I'll think of it later and call back.
[01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:35.749]  Alright, buddy, good to hear from you.
[01:36:35.749 --> 01:36:40.150]  Alright, I'm going to go to Carlos, Roger, Dale, Zachary.
[01:36:40.150 --> 01:36:42.430]  I'm going to get to everybody here.
[01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:45.431]  And we're going to have open phones once Mike Adams is here.
[01:36:45.431 --> 01:36:52.973]  But I'm going to clear the phone system and obviously open the phones for subjects he's covering with some breaking news.
[01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.913]  But first I want to get into the news.
[01:36:56.638 --> 01:37:08.085]  But first, but first, before I do that, I know the sales guys are just super deep in making theme music, and that's great, but I do need them to give me that folder.
[01:37:08.085 --> 01:37:24.295]  Now, on top of all of this, we're launching, starting Thursday, a lot of new powerful media systems at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:35.748]  And the success of this project really is up to you.
[01:37:35.748 --> 01:37:38.410]  It comes down to that.
[01:37:38.410 --> 01:37:43.755]  The success of PrisonPlanet.TV really is up to you.
[01:37:44.994 --> 01:37:49.256]  The success of the information, even if you don't become a prisonplanet.tv member.
[01:37:49.256 --> 01:37:54.439]  The information obviously is designed to leak out everywhere, and please take it and get it out to people.
[01:37:54.439 --> 01:38:03.283]  But it's going to be a condensed, focused, 30-minute news transmission with reporters in the field, interviewers joining us.
[01:38:03.283 --> 01:38:08.626]  We're even going to get a fiber optic hookup so it's even better than Skype.
[01:38:08.626 --> 01:38:11.828]  In-depth subjects that are really focused in on.
[01:38:13.131 --> 01:38:17.674]  So the latest news, key topics covered, guest.
[01:38:17.674 --> 01:38:20.675]  This is a big, big undertaking.
[01:38:20.675 --> 01:38:29.440]  And it is those of you that have bought the t-shirts, the DVDs, the InfoWars ball caps, that have supported our sponsors over the years that are making this possible.
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.202]  But we do want to be able to continue this operation and expand it.
[01:38:33.202 --> 01:38:36.844]  So please become a PrisonPlanet.tv member today.
[01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:41.167]  If you let your PrisonPlanet.tv membership lapse, please re-up it.
[01:38:41.927 --> 01:38:49.970]  Either tomorrow or Wednesday, we will launch two new functions on PrisonPlanet.TV that I'll announce.
[01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:54.932]  Then, so much is coming to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:38:54.932 --> 01:38:57.653]  And of course, the nightly news transmission.
[01:38:57.653 --> 01:38:59.734]  We've had a lot of TV offers over the years.
[01:38:59.734 --> 01:39:00.894]  Hey, produce a TV show.
[01:39:00.894 --> 01:39:08.157]  This network will carry it, or this cable system, or places in Germany, Japan, England, the U.S., Canada.
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:14.084]  And most of them are channels that have millions of viewers, but that's in the aggregate.
[01:39:14.084 --> 01:39:19.369]  There might be 50,000 people watching at any one time, and that's not an inconsequential audience.
[01:39:19.369 --> 01:39:25.935]  It's just we haven't had the facilities, the time, the money, the energy to actually produce something.
[01:39:25.935 --> 01:39:30.459]  They've said, well, just give us your daily radio slash TV show and edit it together.
[01:39:30.459 --> 01:39:31.760]  And I'm like, I don't have the energy.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.841]  I don't have the time.
[01:39:32.841 --> 01:39:33.722]  I don't have the producers.
[01:39:36.175 --> 01:39:51.723]  But that is something we're going to do down the road as well, is have a condensed news brief every day out of this three-hour show that is tagged on to the nightly news and the special reports and the documentaries that are going to premiere there.
[01:39:51.723 --> 01:39:57.646]  You know, I started six years ago making a JFK documentary and it turns into a labyrinth
[01:39:58.604 --> 01:40:02.345]  A veritable labyrinth of research and facts and proof.
[01:40:02.345 --> 01:40:17.630]  And now Jackie, they released the tapes of her saying LBJ had her husband killed, and that intersects with all the other intel we've got from his mistress, LBJ's mistress, and his lawyer, McClellan, that went public, and the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hine.
[01:40:17.630 --> 01:40:20.871]  And again, that's as high as they knew it went, was the President.
[01:40:21.581 --> 01:40:26.107]  People play these straw men going, he's not saying the banks did it, he's saying LBJ.
[01:40:26.107 --> 01:40:29.451]  All of our witnesses go as high as LBJ.
[01:40:29.451 --> 01:40:33.016]  Obviously, he's controlled as well.
[01:40:33.016 --> 01:40:38.824]  That's why I've got to be careful what I say and what I do, because the straw men arguments, they take whatever I say and then limit it.
[01:40:39.977 --> 01:40:41.999]  But you can't stop people that are being deceptive.
[01:40:41.999 --> 01:40:45.722]  It's just that Alex Jones covering up who really killed Kennedy.
[01:40:45.722 --> 01:40:46.262]  Yeah, right.
[01:40:46.262 --> 01:40:49.165]  We're going to put that out in a four-part documentary.
[01:40:49.165 --> 01:40:53.649]  We've probably got a hundred hours of interviews alone.
[01:40:53.649 --> 01:40:55.690]  Hundreds and hundreds of hours of documents.
[01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:56.511]  It's just insane.
[01:40:56.511 --> 01:40:59.594]  A lot of it never before seen.
[01:40:59.594 --> 01:41:03.697]  So that's coming to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:41:03.697 --> 01:41:06.199]  And then in the final equation, I don't
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.261]  Like the term PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:41:09.261 --> 01:41:12.003]  PrisonPlanet's a good website to expose the police state.
[01:41:12.003 --> 01:41:17.025]  PrisonPlanet.tv, eight plus years, is a great website and has eight years of material.
[01:41:17.025 --> 01:41:26.090]  But I'm going to segue on the same platform, but with even newer technologies, over to a news type name.
[01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:30.473]  So if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member in the future, it'll work on both sites.
[01:41:30.473 --> 01:41:33.775]  And we'll keep both up in case one ever goes down with problems.
[01:41:33.775 --> 01:41:35.876]  Well, my membership works right here as well.
[01:41:36.796 --> 01:41:39.697]  So, a lot coming to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:41:39.697 --> 01:41:45.000]  Don't forget the online video slash Patriot Apparel shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.100]  People say, oh, thank you so much for what you do.
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:50.002]  If you appreciate what we're doing, support the broadcast.
[01:41:50.002 --> 01:42:01.406]  Buy the books, buy the videos, buy the t-shirts, buy the ball caps, the citizen rule books, the InfoWars pins, all of it, the InfoWars swag, as they call it, and get it out to everyone you know.
[01:42:01.406 --> 01:42:02.887]  And I want to thank you for your support.
[01:42:02.887 --> 01:42:04.408]  And lastly, speaking of sponsors,
[01:42:05.288 --> 01:42:07.349]  Survival Rx.
[01:42:07.349 --> 01:42:12.170]  Legislation like Codex Alimentarius threatens our ability to purchase vitamins and supplements in the future.
[01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:17.871]  Our new sponsor, Survival Rx, is the world's first long-term storable vitamin and nutritional supplements.
[01:42:17.871 --> 01:42:24.993]  They created a proprietary triple nitrogen flush manufacturing process that will allow you to store their high-quality vitamins for decades.
[01:42:24.993 --> 01:42:26.334]  By the way, I've ordered some of these.
[01:42:26.334 --> 01:42:27.194]  This is a great idea.
[01:42:28.083 --> 01:42:33.027]  From now through the end of August, that isn't long, they're offering free shipping inside the continental U.S.
[01:42:33.027 --> 01:42:34.389]  for listeners of the show.
[01:42:34.389 --> 01:42:37.611]  That's Survival, the letters RX.com.
[01:42:37.611 --> 01:42:40.694]  So visit SurvivalRX.com today.
[01:42:40.694 --> 01:42:44.197]  And they're a vitamin company, been around for a long time, so they've come out with this new system.
[01:42:44.197 --> 01:42:44.898]  Very good idea.
[01:42:44.898 --> 01:42:50.683]  And it is the sponsors, again, that make this broadcast possible, including our local AM and FM sponsors.
[01:42:50.683 --> 01:42:53.866]  Be sure and support them, or if you're a local business, sponsor the show.
[01:42:54.838 --> 01:43:14.626]  A lot of brave patriotic stations picking this show up, and it shows how far the message of liberty has come that Ron Paul's a major presidential contender, that the Federal Reserve's on the verge of being audited and extremely unpopular, 85% in most polls, and that this show is now seen as enough mainstream.
[01:43:14.626 --> 01:43:15.787]  I didn't change my message.
[01:43:15.787 --> 01:43:22.430]  The world kind of caught up with us, and we're getting a lot of great stations out there, and I want to thank them as well.
[01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.670]  Okay.
[01:43:24.884 --> 01:43:46.423]  Let me... Speaking of Mike Adams and suppressed technologies and hidden shadow government systems, secret vaccine industry ties, and military involvement with Institute of Medicine that runs around certifying that vaccines aren't hurting people, despite all the evidence.
[01:43:46.423 --> 01:43:49.285]  That's coming up the next hour after your calls.
[01:43:49.285 --> 01:43:50.567]  Then there's this report.
[01:43:51.584 --> 01:43:58.771]  That I wrote with Paul Watson just because I find it to be so interesting.
[01:43:58.771 --> 01:44:05.918]  Speaking of life extension technologies, the first artificial heart was what, in the early 1980s?
[01:44:05.918 --> 01:44:13.785]  And the guy that got it didn't live very long, and then the next guy lived a little bit longer, and the next guy a little bit longer.
[01:44:13.785 --> 01:44:16.508]  What they've learned to do is to put a
[01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:31.304]  Bionic heart on the outside and then ventricle that in to the heart and then use the heart as basically a bag to pump the blood around the body.
[01:44:31.304 --> 01:44:36.409]  So the pump on the outside does the actual pumping and then the heart itself is just used for its valves.
[01:44:38.741 --> 01:44:41.083]  And, you know, the heart is still there.
[01:44:41.083 --> 01:44:48.749]  It doesn't cut into all the nerve endings that then cause so many other respiration problems in the lungs once you have obviously had your heart cut out.
[01:44:49.677 --> 01:44:55.399]  And so Dick Cheney, for now 14 months, that's longer than almost anybody survived one of these.
[01:44:55.399 --> 01:45:03.862]  When he got it, they said usually it's a stepping stone, three to six months, hoping that you get a heart transplant so that you can survive.
[01:45:03.862 --> 01:45:09.944]  In fact, very few have survived more than a year with this apparatus continually on them.
[01:45:09.944 --> 01:45:13.585]  And Dick Cheney's done jokes on TV of turning it off.
[01:45:13.585 --> 01:45:15.606]  I mean, he's really a hardcore guy.
[01:45:15.606 --> 01:45:16.206]  He is tough.
[01:45:16.906 --> 01:45:22.771]  I mean, for somebody to be able to enjoy something like this and make jokes out of it, that's about the only way you can survive.
[01:45:22.771 --> 01:45:29.237]  They report people pretty much get depressed and die once they have them because you no longer have a pulse.
[01:45:29.237 --> 01:45:41.949]  And so on your screen is the external bionic heart that then goes through the body, inside the stomach cavity, up into the chest cavity, and pumps blood through the heart.
[01:45:43.257 --> 01:45:44.158]  And here's the headline.
[01:45:44.158 --> 01:45:48.200]  Dick Cheney, one year as a walking zombie.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.902]  Former VP marks anniversary as member of the living dead.
[01:45:52.902 --> 01:46:05.229]  Although the debate still rages as to whether or not he had a pulse to begin with, torture approving, wiretap loving, former Vice President Dick Cheney recently marked one year as a member of the living dead.
[01:46:06.485 --> 01:46:21.350]  In July last year, Cheney had a ventricle assist device implanted in his body, which leaves most recipients without a pulse because it pushes blood continuously instead of mimicking the heart's own pulsate beat.
[01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:34.634]  During an interview aired this morning on MSNBC, Cheney frightened a reporter with his Dawn of the Dead-style annex, removing the battery from his heart pump before it started beeping.
[01:46:35.970 --> 01:46:49.837]  Cheney has survived as a zombie long enough to finalize and promote his new memoir, My Time, in which he unapologetically reaffirms his support for torture, the invasion of Iraq, and warrantless wiretapping.
[01:46:49.837 --> 01:46:54.320]  The former VP's arrogance has not lessened with age or ill health.
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:47:03.245]  The book fails to even admit a single mistake in the prosecution of the Iraq War, which still remains unfinished over eight years later and was the basis
[01:47:04.409 --> 01:47:08.933]  of a cocktail of lies and deceit.
[01:47:08.933 --> 01:47:32.311]  Five hundred and sixty-five pages and a simple apology would have been in order in some of them, writes conservative columnist George Will, which is to say the great fact of those eight years is that we went to war, big war, costly war, under false pretenses and to write a memoir in which you see essentially nothing seriously went wrong
[01:47:33.559 --> 01:47:40.865]  If I wrote a memoir of my last week, I would have had things to apologize for.
[01:47:40.865 --> 01:47:46.309]  That's George Will kind of being an apologist in an offhanded way for Lord Cheney.
[01:47:46.309 --> 01:47:51.773]  And then it just goes through some of the crimes of Dick Cheney and the fact that he is a zombie.
[01:47:51.773 --> 01:47:56.617]  Because when you don't have a pulse, that's the old definition of being dead.
[01:47:56.617 --> 01:48:01.701]  And reportedly Dick Cheney now, for close to 14 months, has not had a pulse.
[01:48:01.701 --> 01:48:02.942]  Speaking of zombies,
[01:48:04.121 --> 01:48:08.483]  We're going to put on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers a photo that surfaced last Friday.
[01:48:08.483 --> 01:48:09.963]  I saw it on Drudge.
[01:48:09.963 --> 01:48:14.565]  Headline, shocking photos of Steve Jobs.
[01:48:14.565 --> 01:48:19.547]  And some Indian website with no proof said it was a fake photo, but Jobs never came out and said that.
[01:48:19.547 --> 01:48:24.308]  TMZ got it from a reputable news source, Pacific Coast News.
[01:48:24.308 --> 01:48:27.750]  And when you blow the video up, there's light on the side of his neck.
[01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:34.035]  And the sunlight makes it look like his head's been stuck on there, but that's exactly what sunlight does.
[01:48:34.035 --> 01:48:35.055]  That's a real photo.
[01:48:35.055 --> 01:48:35.976]  He's being supported.
[01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:43.322]  I blew up old photos of him six months ago when he was extremely frail and looked at the hands.
[01:48:43.322 --> 01:48:44.563]  It's Steve Jobs.
[01:48:44.563 --> 01:48:45.824]  It's a real photo.
[01:48:45.824 --> 01:48:49.307]  That's why he announced he's resigning.
[01:48:49.307 --> 01:48:50.949]  And I'm sad for Dick Cheney.
[01:48:50.949 --> 01:48:57.013]  I'm sad for Steve Jobs because despite telling us all day what great humanitarians they are,
[01:48:58.206 --> 01:49:06.893]  The fact is, Apple contracts with some of the most egregious companies in China, where they make people stand without breaks for 12 hours a day.
[01:49:06.893 --> 01:49:18.343]  We're talking hundreds of hours of overtime per pay period, people committing suicide, people being screamed at, massive numbers of suicide, suicide nets around the buildings.
[01:49:18.343 --> 01:49:24.988]  And then Al Gore is on the Apple board, always lecturing us, always telling us
[01:49:26.089 --> 01:49:31.110]  That we need to do this and do that and pay carbon taxes to Al Gore.
[01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:39.192]  So I hope that Steve Jobs comes out before he dies and actually says, hey, we should certify our products that they have a living wage.
[01:49:39.192 --> 01:49:40.772]  There's already groups that do that.
[01:49:40.772 --> 01:49:48.173]  They could set the mark for countries that have slave labor to up their wages to a living standard.
[01:49:48.173 --> 01:49:51.794]  And that would pull these people out of abject slavery, but also then
[01:49:52.856 --> 01:49:54.037]  Wouldn't bring the U.S.
[01:49:54.037 --> 01:49:54.318]  down.
[01:49:54.318 --> 01:50:04.229]  See, when you buy slave goods, and we all do it to a certain extent, when you buy slave goods, that destroys your economy, too, and pulls you closer to slave wages.
[01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:05.571]  It's a giant sucking sound.
[01:50:05.571 --> 01:50:07.773]  So it truly is you reap what you sow.
[01:50:07.773 --> 01:50:10.917]  Now, in other news, this supposedly came out a week ago.
[01:50:11.974 --> 01:50:12.895]  Or a week and a half ago.
[01:50:12.895 --> 01:50:14.176]  I didn't know about it.
[01:50:14.176 --> 01:50:20.241]  I disagree with some of his politics, but I think he's an honorable underdog guy who has a lot of courage and who I respect.
[01:50:20.241 --> 01:50:24.564]  Activist Russell Means fighting esophageal cancer.
[01:50:24.564 --> 01:50:26.286]  And we're trying to get him on the show.
[01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:30.229]  They said they might have been able to treat him if he had his tongue removed and part of his throat.
[01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:33.011]  But he said, I will not.
[01:50:33.011 --> 01:50:36.074]  I will not do something worse than death and have my tongue cut out.
[01:50:36.074 --> 01:50:40.217]  So he is trying tribal remedies and things and
[01:50:42.349 --> 01:50:51.775]  We should all pray for Russell Means, and we're also going to work to get him on the show, because he says, even though he has trouble talking, that he's going to continue to speak out until he dies.
[01:50:51.775 --> 01:50:54.797]  Hopefully he gets better, but it's spread all over his body.
[01:50:54.797 --> 01:50:55.918]  Everybody goes, folks.
[01:50:55.918 --> 01:50:57.019]  Death comes for us all.
[01:50:57.019 --> 01:50:58.300]  Remember that.
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:01.862]  Remember that.

[01:54:12.583 --> 01:54:14.625]  Okay, Carlos in Oregon.
[01:54:14.625 --> 01:54:15.906]  Thank you for holding her on the air.
[01:54:15.906 --> 01:54:17.428]  Welcome.
[01:54:17.428 --> 01:54:18.449]  Alex, how's it going?
[01:54:18.449 --> 01:54:19.750]  Good.
[01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:31.722]  I'm calling today, first of all, I want to let you know I'm a patriot that came to the Truth Movement by yourself and by Aaron Russo, rest in peace his memory.
[01:54:31.722 --> 01:54:36.447]  I'm calling to speak to you today and to try to help change your mind and change other patriots' minds about the concept of
[01:54:36.927 --> 01:54:39.849]  Listen, I'll keep you on and listen to you, but here's the deal.
[01:54:39.849 --> 01:54:41.570]  Al Gore says, say it's racism if you don't support
[01:55:06.003 --> 01:55:08.466]  Uh, paying him money for global warming.
[01:55:08.466 --> 01:55:08.967]  Okay?
[01:55:08.967 --> 01:55:10.428]  And so it's used as a weapon.
[01:55:10.428 --> 01:55:13.652]  So at a certain point, I don't care how something sounds.
[01:55:13.652 --> 01:55:14.353]  Here's the deal.
[01:55:15.802 --> 01:55:18.584]  You got six and a half billion people that want to come here.
[01:55:18.584 --> 01:55:25.209]  The government immediately tries to put them on welfare, which further bankrupts the system, because that's what the banks want.
[01:55:25.209 --> 01:55:29.913]  The vast majority of the immigrants, regardless of where they come from, think, oh, the government's here to help me.
[01:55:29.913 --> 01:55:31.774]  I'll vote for socialism.
[01:55:31.774 --> 01:55:35.997]  And soon, they're going to have enough votes to get rid of the Second Amendment, private property.
[01:55:36.957 --> 01:55:37.839]  Everything.
[01:55:37.839 --> 01:55:41.645]  It's not those people individually that I have a problem with.
[01:55:41.645 --> 01:55:44.169]  I got folks of all colors working for me.
[01:55:44.169 --> 01:55:45.872]  I like everybody.
[01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:48.015]  It's that I'm not obsessed with this.
[01:55:48.015 --> 01:55:49.477]  I know that if you come into Mexico...
[01:55:50.546 --> 01:55:54.608]  They have some of the most draconian, illegal alien rules in the world.
[01:55:54.608 --> 01:55:57.709]  Six months to a year hard labor, if they catch you.
[01:55:57.709 --> 01:56:00.411]  But that's good, that's okay, their government says.
[01:56:00.411 --> 01:56:05.413]  But then our government, that's been the most open out there, is saying just come, come, come.
[01:56:05.413 --> 01:56:08.255]  This isn't a hundred years ago where there wasn't any welfare.
[01:56:08.255 --> 01:56:09.655]  And we are bankrupt.
[01:56:09.655 --> 01:56:12.437]  And so it's the globalists are for open borders.
[01:56:12.437 --> 01:56:14.157]  So that tells me I should be against it.
[01:56:14.157 --> 01:56:15.398]  Now, go ahead and make your point, sorry.
[01:56:15.598 --> 01:56:17.839]  Welfare should not be given to new immigrants.
[01:56:17.839 --> 01:56:20.999]  That's a falsity to think that welfare should be given to new immigrants.
[01:56:20.999 --> 01:56:25.140]  New immigrants should not receive something that they haven't paid into, for one.
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:35.983]  Second of all, you have to look at it as a situation that these people are running from something the same way people from other countries run from the disparity in their country and the fact that they can't get through and can't get past.
[01:56:36.423 --> 01:56:38.484]  And they get stuck, and they have two choices.
[01:56:38.484 --> 01:56:43.548]  They can either run and become an illegal citizen here, like my grandfather, I mean grandmother, and my father did.
[01:56:43.548 --> 01:56:45.949]  Or they can be stuck and die where they're at.
[01:56:45.949 --> 01:56:56.256]  You need to understand that I came, I'm a first generation American, and I'm a true patriot, and I'm fighting for Ron Paul, and for, for the, you know, sovereignty of the United States against the globalists.
[01:56:56.256 --> 01:56:59.718]  But you also have to understand that the only reason this happens, and the only reason it exists,
[01:57:00.183 --> 01:57:03.750]  Is because of the disparity that is happening in Mexico.
[01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:05.293]  These people are refugees.
[01:57:05.293 --> 01:57:06.395]  They're not illegal immigrants.
[01:57:12.276 --> 01:57:23.221]  Okay, well my point is this, my point is that if you look back at our laws, and you look back, it wasn't until 1917 that a law was passed that was restricting the number of immigrants from Mexico.
[01:57:23.221 --> 01:57:29.464]  And before that, they flew back and forth, not flew, but you know, traveled back and forth between Mexico and the United States.
[01:57:29.464 --> 01:57:32.806]  I totally, listen, listen, listen, I totally get it.
[01:57:35.692 --> 01:57:38.796]  Mexicans have as much a right to be here as anybody else.
[01:57:38.796 --> 01:57:45.966]  They were here before anybody except maybe a few Russians on the West Coast.
[01:57:45.966 --> 01:57:48.889]  I understand all that because the Spanish were here.
[01:57:48.889 --> 01:57:49.670]  The French were here.
[01:57:50.911 --> 01:57:52.772]  Everybody was battling over it.
[01:57:52.772 --> 01:58:00.578]  If Mexico was like Switzerland, but with brown people, I'd be like, well fine, whatever.
[01:58:00.578 --> 01:58:07.343]  It's a third world country under globalist control, completely collapsing, and it's like the U.S.
[01:58:07.343 --> 01:58:08.044]  is a lifeboat.
[01:58:09.153 --> 01:58:18.561]  If we, look, the wages are going down, the country's falling apart, and look, I'm against slave labor in prisons, you know, where they get 25 cents an hour.
[01:58:18.561 --> 01:58:20.222]  There's all colors in there.
[01:58:20.222 --> 01:58:22.584]  I'm not against the prisoners working.
[01:58:22.584 --> 01:58:25.466]  I'm against them undercutting all the jobs.
[01:58:25.466 --> 01:58:26.247]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:58:27.027 --> 01:58:32.410]  We need to make it so these people can come here properly and not have a draconian immigration policy.
[01:58:32.410 --> 01:58:33.311]  Listen, listen.
[01:58:33.311 --> 01:58:39.094]  I might not have such a big issue if the welfare wasn't involved and if the illegals were like you.
[01:58:39.094 --> 01:58:41.535]  Stay there.
[01:58:41.535 --> 01:58:43.397]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:59.561 --> 01:59:04.366]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.366 --> 01:59:10.753]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.753 --> 01:59:12.996]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.536 --> 01:59:13.996]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.996 --> 01:59:14.336]  Bernanke?
[01:59:14.336 --> 01:59:14.716]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.716 --> 01:59:15.677]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.677 --> 01:59:17.798]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.443 --> 01:59:34.564]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.564 --> 01:59:39.705]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:00:10.593 --> 02:00:12.195]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.195 --> 02:00:13.737]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.737 --> 02:00:17.922]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.922 --> 02:00:22.046]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.671 --> 02:00:40.333]  Okay, Carlos is with us.
[02:00:40.333 --> 02:00:43.516]  We'll get to Roger Dale, James Zachary, all of you.
[02:00:43.516 --> 02:00:45.677]  I appreciate you joining us.
[02:00:45.677 --> 02:00:49.921]  Listen, Carlos, here's the deal.
[02:00:49.921 --> 02:00:53.143]  I've been to the Met General Arraza meetings.
[02:00:53.143 --> 02:00:55.105]  I've watched the videotapes.
[02:00:55.105 --> 02:00:57.487]  I know the big Ford Foundation is funding it.
[02:00:58.703 --> 02:01:16.493]  And for whatever reason, politically, the federal government, 40 years ago or so, funded the liberation theology, just like they funded the Taliban and Al Qaeda, to radicalize groups, so they could then play people off against each other.
[02:01:16.493 --> 02:01:17.894]  I get that.
[02:01:17.894 --> 02:01:19.235]  I get that.
[02:01:19.235 --> 02:01:22.177]  And if somebody is into the Second Amendment, liberty, freedom,
[02:01:23.757 --> 02:01:24.778]  Then I absolutely love him.
[02:01:24.778 --> 02:01:28.362]  We've got a guy, works here, one of my best people.
[02:01:28.362 --> 02:01:30.704]  Just tireless, smart, cool.
[02:01:32.088 --> 02:01:34.929]  I'm even trying to talk him into doing some radio.
[02:01:34.929 --> 02:01:38.691]  Max, but he worries about retribution against his family in Venezuela.
[02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:41.892]  And he's here legally, you know, did it all properly.
[02:01:41.892 --> 02:01:45.933]  And he absolutely hates Hugo Chavez and communism and gets it.
[02:01:45.933 --> 02:01:49.254]  I wouldn't have a problem with 30 million Maxis.
[02:01:49.254 --> 02:01:52.696]  But I'm sorry, I've looked at the actuaries.
[02:01:52.696 --> 02:01:57.918]  Most of these illegals, who are aliens of this country, that's what Mexico calls illegals that come in.
[02:01:59.559 --> 02:02:09.965]  Absolutely, foundation, university run, constant talk about Whitey, constant we're going to set up a socialist, you know, metch-a-la-raza.
[02:02:09.965 --> 02:02:13.207]  And so, I've tried to put the word out.
[02:02:13.207 --> 02:02:14.988]  I've even reached out to these groups in Austin.
[02:02:15.948 --> 02:02:22.453]  One time I'm like, listen, I'd like you to come on the radio and I'd like you to understand this.
[02:02:22.453 --> 02:02:24.034]  Listen, fat pig gringo.
[02:02:24.034 --> 02:02:30.319]  This is one of the main leaders of the guy that then had the big Mecha Parade.
[02:02:30.319 --> 02:02:32.020]  We're going to kick you out of this country, basically.
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:32.601]  I said, that's it.
[02:02:32.601 --> 02:02:35.143]  I'm coming down to bull horn your event.
[02:02:35.143 --> 02:02:36.124]  He goes, you wouldn't dare.
[02:02:36.124 --> 02:02:37.064]  I dare you.
[02:02:37.064 --> 02:02:37.565]  Something bad.
[02:02:37.565 --> 02:02:38.465]  And I said, OK, that's it.
[02:02:38.465 --> 02:02:38.846]  I'm coming.
[02:02:39.346 --> 02:02:40.509]  And I don't care how it looks.
[02:02:40.509 --> 02:02:45.318]  I'll go out in front of 5,000 Hispanic Klan members and tell them to go to Hades.
[02:02:45.318 --> 02:02:46.821]  I don't care.
[02:02:46.821 --> 02:02:49.065]  Just like I bullhorned the Klan repeatedly.
[02:02:49.065 --> 02:02:50.488]  But see, in political correctness...
[02:02:51.576 --> 02:02:57.158]  It's okay to have Hispanics be taught to hate white people, and I'm sick of it.
[02:02:57.158 --> 02:03:03.040]  I mean, this is a government plan to get us at each other's throats, and I have had enough, Carlos.
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:05.241]  So, here's the deal.
[02:03:05.241 --> 02:03:06.901]  I mean, how many Latin Americans do we take?
[02:03:06.901 --> 02:03:08.482]  Do we take 700 million?
[02:03:08.482 --> 02:03:09.262]  That's what's down there.
[02:03:09.262 --> 02:03:12.023]  In 20 years, there's going to be over a billion.
[02:03:12.023 --> 02:03:13.404]  Do we take a billion people up here?
[02:03:14.424 --> 02:03:16.385]  And I'm sorry, I've been to Central America.
[02:03:16.385 --> 02:03:17.526]  I've been down there.
[02:03:17.526 --> 02:03:20.808]  For whatever reason, they never got a culture of freedom going.
[02:03:20.808 --> 02:03:23.809]  And when the... I don't know how to explain it to you.
[02:03:23.809 --> 02:03:25.490]  It is imploding.
[02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:30.993]  And I don't have an issue with immigration to this country.
[02:03:30.993 --> 02:03:40.919]  The problem is, is that a large portion of these folks see an American flag on somebody's shirt at public school, even if the Hispanic kid has the shirt on, and they're sent home.
[02:03:41.899 --> 02:03:43.520]  Now be honest about it, Carlos.
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:52.845]  Is there not a large contingent of people that see themselves as Mexicans and who think they're, quote, engaging in the La Reconquista?
[02:03:52.845 --> 02:03:54.666]  There is a huge amount of people that do that.
[02:03:54.666 --> 02:04:04.772]  I absolutely agree with you and I absolutely agree that they are extremists and these people are attempting to do the same thing on one side that extremists do on the other side and on other sides of this fight.
[02:04:04.772 --> 02:04:07.693]  And like you said, they want us all at each other's throats.
[02:04:07.693 --> 02:04:08.634]  My only point is this.
[02:04:09.074 --> 02:04:13.895]  Mexicans that come here, that come to this country illegally, they pay taxes because they're employers.
[02:04:13.895 --> 02:04:17.516]  I know this because I've worked for paralegal firms that deal with 99% Hispanics.
[02:04:17.516 --> 02:04:21.997]  And they are told to make sure and put some sort of tax wage on their taxes.
[02:04:21.997 --> 02:04:26.198]  Otherwise, they might end up getting looked at by the federal government.
[02:04:26.198 --> 02:04:29.059]  They pay... I know they pay sales taxes and everything.
[02:04:29.059 --> 02:04:30.800]  I got all that.
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.401]  Listen, all I'm saying is, we should have a whole discussion about this the other day.
[02:04:36.401 --> 02:04:37.501]  Here's another thing.
[02:04:37.501 --> 02:04:41.642]  The United States within 10 years is going to be half Hispanic.
[02:04:41.642 --> 02:04:52.485]  And Hispanics that are Americans should ask themselves, are you going to buy into this Ford Foundation stuff and let Unlimited in?
[02:04:52.485 --> 02:04:55.345]  Because it's going to destroy your future as well.
[02:04:55.345 --> 02:04:56.965]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:04:56.965 --> 02:04:58.846]  They need to fix their problems in Mexico.
[02:05:02.150 --> 02:05:03.852]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:03.852 --> 02:05:09.159]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:05:09.159 --> 02:05:10.702]  Saving means to make money.
[02:05:10.702 --> 02:05:19.493]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:20.214 --> 02:05:27.760]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:35.766]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:35.766 --> 02:05:40.990]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:43.152]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-
[02:05:44.653 --> 02:05:49.135]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:05:49.135 --> 02:05:53.638]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:05.203]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.203 --> 02:06:06.123]  Number one.
[02:06:06.123 --> 02:06:09.546]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.546 --> 02:06:10.406]  Number two.
[02:06:10.406 --> 02:06:15.289]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.289 --> 02:06:16.050]  It's true.
[02:06:16.050 --> 02:06:20.913]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.913 --> 02:06:21.733]  Number three.
[02:06:21.733 --> 02:06:25.316]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.316 --> 02:06:29.018]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.218 --> 02:06:30.019]  Number 4.
[02:06:30.019 --> 02:06:32.782]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.782 --> 02:06:36.466]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.466 --> 02:06:37.247]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.247 --> 02:06:41.412]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.412 --> 02:06:46.157]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.437 --> 02:06:50.620]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:52.401]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:52.401 --> 02:06:54.642]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:06:57.284 --> 02:07:07.611]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:07:07.611 --> 02:07:12.754]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:07:12.754 --> 02:07:14.616]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:07:16.809 --> 02:07:27.816]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:34.554]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:07:34.554 --> 02:07:38.397]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:07:38.397 --> 02:07:39.618]  Others don't.
[02:07:39.618 --> 02:07:41.760]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:43.541]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:07:43.541 --> 02:07:46.443]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:07:46.443 --> 02:07:50.687]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:07:50.687 --> 02:07:53.069]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:07:55.771 --> 02:07:58.133]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:07:58.133 --> 02:07:59.014]  Others don't.
[02:08:02.185 --> 02:08:04.426]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.426 --> 02:08:12.731]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.731 --> 02:08:26.480]  Finishing up, if you just joined us with what I was saying to Carlos earlier, he was calling from Washington State.
[02:08:28.359 --> 02:08:32.582]  Hispanics are soon going to be 50% of the U.S.
[02:08:32.582 --> 02:08:34.863]  population by 2020, the U.S.
[02:08:34.863 --> 02:08:36.124]  Census believes.
[02:08:36.124 --> 02:08:41.888]  So, if people look at this from a racial position, you've won!
[02:08:41.888 --> 02:08:42.429]  You've won!
[02:08:42.429 --> 02:08:43.449]  You're America!
[02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:45.571]  White people don't have children anymore.
[02:08:45.571 --> 02:08:47.672]  White people are in love with their iPods.
[02:08:47.672 --> 02:08:52.095]  White people have lost so much of their soul that they can't even have children.
[02:08:52.095 --> 02:08:54.497]  You're right when Matt Chenla Raza says, look at you.
[02:08:54.497 --> 02:08:55.197]  You're dead.
[02:08:55.197 --> 02:08:56.658]  Your culture's dead.
[02:08:56.658 --> 02:08:56.959]  Yes.
[02:08:57.952 --> 02:09:00.993]  Yes, all civilizations commit suicide.
[02:09:00.993 --> 02:09:05.954]  America has committed suicide, Europe's dead, Pat Buchanan's talked about it, death of the West.
[02:09:05.954 --> 02:09:23.937]  So, I would say to the new holders of this civilization, which came out of Europe, which set up Latin America right out of Spain, that you should come back to your Western roots, and that you should embrace it, and see America as yours.
[02:09:25.049 --> 02:09:29.753]  Because my issue is I care about people in Brazil, Mexico, you name it.
[02:09:29.753 --> 02:09:31.955]  I wish they could all come here.
[02:09:31.955 --> 02:09:33.997]  But this country is bankrupt.
[02:09:33.997 --> 02:09:39.381]  And government and the collectivists go and recruit the illegals that come to this country.
[02:09:39.381 --> 02:09:42.624]  They have their babies here for free.
[02:09:42.624 --> 02:09:43.685]  I can't do that.
[02:09:43.685 --> 02:09:46.087]  Citizens are turned away from emergency rooms.
[02:09:46.087 --> 02:09:48.369]  They've told the 800 plus cities give the illegals
[02:09:48.809 --> 02:09:49.910]  Healthcare first?
[02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:58.018]  This is a fact, because the corporations use taxpayer funding as an incentive to get the cheap labor here to drive down wages further.
[02:09:58.018 --> 02:09:59.439]  That doesn't help Mexico.
[02:09:59.439 --> 02:10:01.501]  That then drives their wages down further.
[02:10:01.501 --> 02:10:03.543]  That then drives China's wages down.
[02:10:03.543 --> 02:10:05.645]  This has all been broken down by computers.
[02:10:05.645 --> 02:10:10.510]  But Ross Perot told you, 16, 17 years ago, giant sucking sound.
[02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:13.013]  When we lower our wages, it does not help Mexico.
[02:10:13.653 --> 02:10:15.354]  It does not help China.
[02:10:15.354 --> 02:10:18.195]  It helps the very few and only in the short term.
[02:10:18.195 --> 02:10:21.837]  I'm telling you, Al Gore, we're going to lose our industry.
[02:10:21.837 --> 02:10:24.078]  That is ridiculous, Ross.
[02:10:24.078 --> 02:10:25.938]  This is a good deal.
[02:10:25.938 --> 02:10:29.680]  It's going to... Wait, I have to get into real Nelly mode.
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:33.342]  It's going to... Let me do some Twinkle Eyes.
[02:10:33.342 --> 02:10:35.562]  I can't do Twinkle Eyes and be a man bear pig.
[02:10:35.562 --> 02:10:35.963]  Let me try.
[02:10:37.543 --> 02:10:43.010]  Listen, Larry, this is going to double job in the next few years.
[02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:44.631]  I mean, come on!
[02:10:44.631 --> 02:10:49.818]  Look, the globalists are for open borders.
[02:10:49.818 --> 02:10:53.202]  We've got plenty of room in this country.
[02:10:53.202 --> 02:10:56.385]  If there was no welfare, and if we could
[02:10:57.518 --> 02:11:05.505]  Literally educate these people coming out of tyranny about the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Ron Paul style ideas.
[02:11:05.505 --> 02:11:07.908]  And then once they became citizens said, here's your machine gun.
[02:11:07.908 --> 02:11:11.171]  Okay, then there wouldn't be an issue.
[02:11:11.171 --> 02:11:15.354]  With maybe another 50 million or so in a couple decades.
[02:11:15.354 --> 02:11:17.697]  The problem is, it takes time to grow the infrastructure.
[02:11:18.703 --> 02:11:20.304]  See, that brings in welfare.
[02:11:20.304 --> 02:11:22.865]  Look, I don't want to have to get off into the whole science of it.
[02:11:22.865 --> 02:11:34.449]  The issue is people who are American, regardless of what color you are, you got to look at your children and ask yourself the question, the globalists are for open borders and unlimited immigration.
[02:11:34.449 --> 02:11:38.870]  Now, everything the globalists are for is bad for you.
[02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:40.191]  That's a good rule of thumb.
[02:11:40.191 --> 02:11:46.113]  But once you intellectually and economically and historically look it up, you're going to see the facts there.
[02:11:47.145 --> 02:11:49.547]  You're going to learn that, indeed, it is bad.
[02:11:49.547 --> 02:11:50.108]  Okay?
[02:11:50.108 --> 02:11:53.151]  Every other country has immigration controls but us.
[02:11:53.151 --> 02:11:54.653]  We're a joke.
[02:11:54.653 --> 02:11:55.654]  We're a joke.
[02:11:55.654 --> 02:11:57.696]  The country is collapsing.
[02:11:57.696 --> 02:11:57.936]  Okay?
[02:11:57.936 --> 02:11:59.417]  That's all I have to say on the subject.
[02:11:59.417 --> 02:12:06.765]  And you heard the Hispanic American guy earlier, you know, say, no, I admit, it's massive amounts of Hispanics who are like, La Raza, get the gringo.
[02:12:07.105 --> 02:12:08.806]  Okay, but let's just get it out in the open.
[02:12:08.806 --> 02:12:15.610]  Point is, I'm not going to sit here and play along with this game that the government foundations didn't engineer this in the universities and high schools.
[02:12:15.610 --> 02:12:17.150]  It was taught where I was.
[02:12:17.150 --> 02:12:19.492]  I went to Anderson for two years here in Austin.
[02:12:19.492 --> 02:12:21.813]  I was taught white people are evil by the white teachers.
[02:12:22.273 --> 02:12:24.074]  This is La Reconquista.
[02:12:24.074 --> 02:12:25.314]  The Hispanics will get you.
[02:12:25.314 --> 02:12:26.395]  The whites are evil.
[02:12:26.395 --> 02:12:33.958]  I was taken to the University of Texas in art class and taught by one of their Chicano Studies guys that America was bad and that I was bad.
[02:12:33.958 --> 02:12:35.559]  And I said, I don't agree with this.
[02:12:35.559 --> 02:12:38.320]  Mexico had its own atrocities and problems and new history.
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:42.222]  And they totally freaked out, had a meeting, and came up and said, how do you know history?
[02:12:42.222 --> 02:12:42.982]  And who are you?
[02:12:42.982 --> 02:12:45.363]  And it was like they found a leprechaun or something.
[02:12:45.363 --> 02:12:47.664]  That I was 18 years old.
[02:12:47.664 --> 02:12:48.645]  I was in high school five years.
[02:12:48.885 --> 02:12:49.906]  I didn't really go the first year.
[02:12:49.906 --> 02:12:52.828]  All right, I'm going to shut up now because Mike Adams is here.
[02:12:52.828 --> 02:12:57.351]  It's just a caller brings up a subject like that and it just gets me going.
[02:12:57.351 --> 02:12:59.612]  We'll also go to your calls and Mike can speak on any issue.
[02:12:59.612 --> 02:13:01.794]  I want to get Mike's take on the latest in Libya.
[02:13:01.794 --> 02:13:13.622]  I want to get his take on some other issues and real environmentalism versus this corporatist environmentalism where they only use it as an authoritarian tool while distracting from all the real environmental
[02:13:14.042 --> 02:13:22.904]  Issues that are out there, but Mike Adams of course heads up a natural news He also has been doing a rap songs that actually are very popular.
[02:13:22.904 --> 02:13:41.187]  He tells me he's doing a heavy metal song later, so this is a literal virtuoso Renaissance man with us here today, and we'll talk about his new rap persona a bit later Natural news.com of course and many other ventures, but you've got several breaking news items first off.
[02:13:41.187 --> 02:13:42.027]  We're gonna get into
[02:13:43.227 --> 02:13:52.893]  The fact that we're learning about some of the behind-the-scenes activity that's going on to manipulate vaccine data for the public.
[02:13:52.893 --> 02:14:09.963]  And you also then have learned more about the KGB-style operations that were used to go after Rossum Foods and now dairies and facilities all over the country where the new cocaine is milk, is cheese, is tomatoes that are actually grown and sold that aren't GMO.
[02:14:10.933 --> 02:14:13.314]  Yeah, we have a number of issues to get into here, Alex, today.
[02:14:13.314 --> 02:14:38.669]  Let's start with the Institute of Medicine and the vaccine issue, because Friday, the Institute of Medicine, the IOM, released its report called Vaccine Adverse Effects, and this report documented some of the adverse effects of MMR vaccines, and in this report, the IOM admitted that MMR vaccines actually cause measles, and they cause seizures, and they cause anaphylactic shock
[02:14:39.269 --> 02:14:45.296]  And other vaccines cause skin lesions and live viral infections throughout the body and other things like that.
[02:14:45.296 --> 02:14:55.669]  But the mainstream media, predictably, looked at this and said, well, we're just going to report this one headline that says the IOM declares vaccines don't cause autism.
[02:14:56.485 --> 02:15:00.889]  And by the way, this report is at InfoWars.com and NaturalNews.com.
[02:15:00.889 --> 02:15:05.473]  I'm scrambling around looking for it here in my stack, but we'll put that headline on screen.
[02:15:05.473 --> 02:15:06.394]  Here it is.
[02:15:06.394 --> 02:15:11.018]  Secret Vaccine Industry Ties and Military Involvement with Institute of Medicine.
[02:15:11.018 --> 02:15:14.401]  You have it all footnoted from their real reports, but that's what they'll do.
[02:15:14.401 --> 02:15:17.043]  It's like Monsanto with Searle.
[02:15:17.043 --> 02:15:18.625]  In the 70s, they admitted that the
[02:15:19.145 --> 02:15:28.214]  Aspartame killed almost all the baby monkeys they gave it to in their mother's milk, but they spun it and said, oh, three of the monkeys lived, and so it means it's good.
[02:15:28.214 --> 02:15:28.814]  Right.
[02:15:28.814 --> 02:15:28.974]  Right.
[02:15:28.974 --> 02:15:30.055]  There's total spin on this.
[02:15:30.055 --> 02:15:34.459]  The old dinosaur media is completely spinning this story, lying with the headlines.
[02:15:35.180 --> 02:15:45.527]  We did a complete breakdown of what the report actually says and reported that on Saturday, which was also published on InfoWars.com, and then we started to ask the questions.
[02:15:45.527 --> 02:15:47.168]  Who funds the Institute of Medicine?
[02:15:47.168 --> 02:15:48.810]  Where does the money come from?
[02:15:48.810 --> 02:15:50.231]  Does it have conflicts of interest?
[02:15:50.931 --> 02:16:16.790]  Now the answer is yes, because this report, which is about vaccines, comes from the IOM, which is funded, get this Alex, it is funded by Monsanto, PepsiCo, McDonald's, and all the major vaccine companies, Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Wyeth, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Aventis, all of these companies are giving money to the Institute of Medicine.
[02:16:17.570 --> 02:16:19.271]  Think about the precedent though.
[02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:34.600]  If they can set the precedent to make us take their products, and try to mandate it, and then run the hoax that it's the law, and make us eat GMO, and as the deaths mount, and the disease mounts, and as their own reports mount, they just run around saying we're conspiracy theorists.
[02:16:35.236 --> 02:16:38.397]  Yeah, and here's why this matters, to your point more specifically.
[02:16:38.397 --> 02:16:45.338]  Remember when Obama recently announced that Medicare must cover birth control pills that had to be paid for by Medicare?
[02:16:45.338 --> 02:16:48.578]  That was based on an Institute of Medicine recommendation.
[02:16:48.578 --> 02:16:53.039]  So the IOM puts out these recommendations that then become public policy.
[02:16:53.039 --> 02:16:55.960]  So the FDA turns to the IOM to make policy.
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:00.361]  The CDC turns to the IOM to make policy about vaccines.
[02:17:00.361 --> 02:17:00.941]  Now, after 9-11,
[02:17:02.321 --> 02:17:15.567]  Just a month later, the IOM said that the attacks on 9-11 prove that we need more vaccine production in America, and it said we need to create something called the National Vaccine Authority, the NVA.
[02:17:15.567 --> 02:17:21.370]  And that comes out of BioShield, that $10 million program with the Level 4 bioweapons labs everywhere.
[02:17:21.570 --> 02:17:22.170]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:17:22.170 --> 02:17:24.771]  This is all tied into the military, and we'll get into some of those ties more.
[02:17:24.771 --> 02:17:31.894]  I mean, the Institute of Medicine is funded in part by the Department of Defense, funded by Department of Homeland Security.
[02:17:31.894 --> 02:17:47.700]  Even though it says on its website that it receives no funding directly from the government, we uncovered proof, and I've got the chart right here that shows it's actually two-thirds, 64.9% of the funding comes from government organizations that then funnel this money into the Institute of Medicine.
[02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:48.600]  They lied to us!
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:50.061]  They would never do that.
[02:17:50.061 --> 02:17:57.464]  Well, that's kind of like Media Matters saying, we get no George Soros money, but then you go to the chain, he gives money to a foundation that then gives it to them.
[02:17:57.464 --> 02:17:57.704]  Right.
[02:17:57.704 --> 02:18:00.825]  And then once it came out, he just said, all right, here's millions directly to them.
[02:18:00.825 --> 02:18:01.505]  That's what they're doing.
[02:18:01.505 --> 02:18:03.206]  They're shuffling this money around.
[02:18:03.206 --> 02:18:04.967]  So tell me about this chart here.
[02:18:04.967 --> 02:18:07.988]  On the left, the big pie chart on the left, 64.9% is money from the government.
[02:18:10.731 --> 02:18:17.613]  And the other third, in the yellow on the far left, is about one-third comes from private industry.
[02:18:17.613 --> 02:18:20.514]  Bill Gates gives money directly to the Institute of Medicine.
[02:18:20.514 --> 02:18:39.321]  In fact, Alex, and your listeners will know why this is important, this report on adverse effects of vaccines was allowed to be reviewed before publication, to be reviewed by, number one, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, number two, a military weapons defense contractor, Northrop Grumman.
[02:18:40.472 --> 02:18:41.353]  Well, they really care.
[02:18:41.353 --> 02:18:43.734]  They've got something special they want us to take.
[02:18:43.734 --> 02:18:50.499]  And they've already got us to the point of accepting the governor of Texas saying, take a shot, they know, killed people in the trials.
[02:18:50.499 --> 02:18:55.802]  I mean, these are, this is eugenics, this is the military trying to murder America.
[02:18:55.802 --> 02:18:56.203]  And folks,
[02:18:57.003 --> 02:19:02.169]  The military, in thousands of tests, has murdered our own troops, knowingly.
[02:19:02.169 --> 02:19:08.516]  They've shot kids up with syphilis and HIV and every other disease you can imagine.
[02:19:08.516 --> 02:19:10.078]  They've been caught over and over again.
[02:19:10.078 --> 02:19:11.339]  This is a fact.
[02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:24.249]  And under martial law, they will release the bioweapon, they will give you then the binary vaccine, generally with a triggered soft kill that kills you a decade down the road, so that they can have plausible deniability.
[02:19:24.249 --> 02:19:31.795]  Just like the Pentagon in Vietnam wanted to have the enemy shot with a 2-2-3 round, it would only wound them and then debilitate them.
[02:19:31.795 --> 02:19:35.218]  And then, the military industrial complex itself is owned by the big megabanks,
[02:19:36.704 --> 02:19:45.167]  And then they had big pharma in the hospitals they own, and then when you go to their hospitals, it's all actuaried out under government health care where the doctors can't even give you real health care.
[02:19:45.167 --> 02:19:52.410]  The computer tells you what to do, and then they suck all the money you've saved out of you with a bioweapon they hit you with.
[02:19:52.410 --> 02:19:59.873]  So they hit you with a bioweapon, then they have the treatment, a perfect weapon, where you then even extract the money and the resources out of someone.
[02:19:59.873 --> 02:20:00.994]  This is the genius.
[02:20:02.734 --> 02:20:04.576]  Hey Bill, pick up line 3, it's Brian.
[02:20:04.576 --> 02:20:06.257]  Hey Brian, what's up?
[02:20:06.257 --> 02:20:06.998]  Thanks.
[02:20:06.998 --> 02:20:12.422]  Hey Bill, I just received my shipment of the Safety Net, our full-year emergency food system.
[02:20:12.422 --> 02:20:20.309]  I can't tell you how great it feels to personally not have to worry anymore, especially with the growing threats to our everyday food supply.
[02:20:20.489 --> 02:20:30.557]  Brian, not only are you getting 4,320 nutritionally dense, delicious food servings, but the individual serving price is just $1.43 per meal.
[02:20:30.557 --> 02:20:33.440]  It's truly great tasting food at amazing prices.
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:35.962]  The variety is also a huge bonus bill.
[02:20:35.962 --> 02:20:39.344]  It's like having access to a full menu of impressive food.
[02:20:39.344 --> 02:20:44.709]  Well, it really is a safety net for those worried about the coming food shortages and how their families can prepare.
[02:20:45.029 --> 02:20:49.413]  It's great knowing I'm covered for the future, but I gotta go, Bill, and get all this food unloaded.
[02:20:49.413 --> 02:20:51.554]  With scorching heat devastating U.S.

[02:22:00.355 --> 02:22:05.921]  Infowars.com for 16 years has led the charge against the technocrats.
[02:22:05.921 --> 02:22:08.123]  We have had unrivaled success in our

[02:22:14.187 --> 02:22:18.230]  No one can deny that our media operation is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:25.655]  And it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[02:22:25.655 --> 02:22:31.179]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[02:22:31.179 --> 02:22:33.401]  The social network is nearing completion as well.
[02:22:33.621 --> 02:22:36.544]  The free newsletter is reaching hundreds of thousands.
[02:22:36.544 --> 02:22:40.807]  Please spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:22:50.275 --> 02:22:51.956]  Look in the mirror.
[02:22:51.956 --> 02:22:53.978]  You are the resistance.
[02:22:53.978 --> 02:22:59.543]  It is up to us, the InfoWarriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[02:23:00.345 --> 02:23:06.753]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[02:23:06.753 --> 02:23:08.195]  I lost 20 pounds.
[02:23:08.195 --> 02:23:09.898]  I lost 40 pounds.
[02:23:09.898 --> 02:23:12.161]  I lost 55 pounds.
[02:23:12.161 --> 02:23:13.562]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[02:23:15.054 --> 02:23:21.936]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[02:23:21.936 --> 02:23:25.578]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:23:25.578 --> 02:23:29.659]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[02:23:29.659 --> 02:23:36.601]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[02:23:36.601 --> 02:23:44.444]  Plus, Amberin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[02:23:51.929 --> 02:23:51.989]  1-800-737-9107.
[02:24:34.289 --> 02:24:44.895]  Okay, Mike, I've been jumping in here because it freaks me out so bad to know that you're doing the research along the lines we've done even deeper, and to know that they even brag.
[02:24:44.895 --> 02:24:51.760]  They roll out the diseases, and then they have the treatments that another division develops, and then the scientists developing that don't even know.
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:58.444]  So this is such a cold-blooded way to not only kill you early, but to extract all the wealth out of you.
[02:24:58.444 --> 02:24:59.945]  So, Mike, please continue.
[02:24:59.945 --> 02:25:03.627]  This is such a big deal that the PR group they claim is independent
[02:25:05.408 --> 02:25:09.230]  Well, that's a great example of what you're just talking about there.
[02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:14.954]  Remember, the Institute of Medicine was created by Congress in 1970, but it's a non-profit.
[02:25:14.954 --> 02:25:22.500]  It's sort of, it has become the go-to authority for any time the President or the CDC or the FDA wants to say something.
[02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:23.720]  Yeah, I'm an independent.
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:24.701]  I'm an independent.
[02:25:24.841 --> 02:25:28.083]  Well, they claim to be independent, but of course, where does their money come from?
[02:25:28.083 --> 02:25:29.084]  Government.
[02:25:29.084 --> 02:25:33.648]  But some of the ties in here throughout the IOM are quite incestuous.
[02:25:33.648 --> 02:25:40.533]  For example, one of the more prominent members of the IOM is a board of director of PepsiCo.
[02:25:40.533 --> 02:25:50.940]  He also sits on the boards of two pharmaceutical companies and one medical device manufacturer named Medtronic, which of course has been sued by 22 states for committing alleged fraud.
[02:25:51.877 --> 02:26:00.360]  Now, one of the pharmaceutical companies that this man sits on the board of, it develops pharmaceuticals to treat kidney disease.
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:03.982]  Well, kidney disease is one of the most common side effects of taking vaccines.
[02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:09.231]  We've established this through many interviews before with kidney experts, dialysis experts.
[02:26:09.231 --> 02:26:10.212]  Tell us this.
[02:26:10.212 --> 02:26:22.455]  So if you look at how this is all connected, Alex, you've got vaccines that cause diseases like kidney disease, like autism, like neurological problems, and then people go to the hospital to get treated for those diseases.
[02:26:22.455 --> 02:26:29.537]  They end up taking the drugs made by the drug companies which are run by the board director members who are also members of the IOM.
[02:26:29.957 --> 02:26:36.738]  That's just one example of this circle, this racket, that goes on behind the scenes.
[02:26:36.738 --> 02:26:38.539]  Please continue with your report.
[02:26:38.539 --> 02:26:39.299]  Sure.
[02:26:39.299 --> 02:26:46.460]  Well, on the defense side, on the military side, and by the way, I see vaccines as being really militarized here in the next year or two.
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:54.522]  I think we're looking at a situation... Remember when Baxter Pharmaceuticals got caught shipping live viruses in its vaccine samples?
[02:26:54.522 --> 02:26:56.562]  That was about, what, 18 months ago or so?
[02:26:57.796 --> 02:27:04.257]  Now we have the Institute of Medicine admitting that some vaccines cause live virus infections throughout the body.
[02:27:04.257 --> 02:27:11.619]  I think we're looking at a situation here in the very near near future where a pandemic will be caused by the vaccine industry.
[02:27:11.619 --> 02:27:26.502]  They're going to put live viruses in the vaccines, cause the pandemic, and then cite the Institute of Medicine's safety report as the reason to push for national mandatory vaccines, which will be enforced by Department of Homeland Security.
[02:27:27.102 --> 02:27:36.991]  Well, we know under the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, they tried to get forced inoculation through, but it failed because the first responders wouldn't be inoculated to then be the enforcers.
[02:27:36.991 --> 02:27:40.435]  So they said, well, you can make people take shots, but you don't have to.
[02:27:40.435 --> 02:27:47.181]  And we know in the H1N1 that came out, they put a quote, marker virus in vaccines the year before that was the H1N1.
[02:27:49.144 --> 02:27:57.831]  So, any big vaccine they push that they're really behind, that's the special vaccine that's had the other things added, and they've done for decades.
[02:27:57.831 --> 02:27:59.333]  Crohn's didn't exist 50 years ago.
[02:27:59.333 --> 02:28:01.114]  Now, it's like getting the cold.
[02:28:01.114 --> 02:28:03.256]  Everybody's got it.
[02:28:03.256 --> 02:28:05.278]  They've gone in in the gut, proven.
[02:28:05.278 --> 02:28:06.559]  Measles vaccines.
[02:28:06.559 --> 02:28:12.244]  So, and Bill and Melinda Gates, the forefront in studying diseases of the gut and then treatments
[02:28:13.447 --> 02:28:15.209]  I mean, these people have got it all figured out.
[02:28:15.209 --> 02:28:17.011]  There's more on this on the military side, too.
[02:28:17.011 --> 02:28:21.816]  Northrop Grumman, who again was allowed to review this report by the IOM.
[02:28:21.816 --> 02:28:31.526]  This is the global military defense contractor that was caught by the State Department in the 1980s selling computer code off of Air Force One to the Russians.
[02:28:32.347 --> 02:28:48.371]  This company has been found by the State Department to be engaged in illegal international arms trafficking, in violation of all State Department rules regarding the exporting of computer code, missile guidance systems, technologies, for example, and many other examples of that.
[02:28:48.371 --> 02:28:58.233]  This company was given a prominent role in a $5 billion grant by the CDC to develop a vaccine tracking information technology system.
[02:28:59.611 --> 02:29:20.047]  And in that grant, Northrop Grumman bragged in a press release that it was going to use its cyber security technology to innovate new systems, I'm paraphrasing obviously, but to innovate new systems to track the spread of infectious disease and to develop more aggressive inoculation or vaccination technologies.
[02:29:20.047 --> 02:29:28.954]  Well what they've said, I remember that coming out a few months ago, that they're going to come out with new tracking systems where you've got to have your shots to be able to go out and do anything.
[02:29:29.534 --> 02:29:32.536]  So, the forcing the public to do this.
[02:29:32.536 --> 02:29:32.916]  Stay there.
[02:29:32.916 --> 02:29:36.839]  Let's continue with this groundbreaking research.
[02:29:36.839 --> 02:29:44.704]  And then we're going to get into the KGB tactics as they try to shut down the grassroots sale of lemonade, tomatoes.
[02:29:44.704 --> 02:29:45.804]  It's the new cocaine.
[02:29:45.804 --> 02:29:47.365]  Lemonade, Al Qaeda.
[02:29:47.365 --> 02:29:48.066]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:48.066 --> 02:29:50.567]  Your phone call's coming up as well.
[02:29:50.567 --> 02:29:51.968]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.968 --> 02:29:54.510]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.510 --> 02:29:57.172]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.882 --> 02:30:05.403]  And you're subject to public police action.
[02:30:05.403 --> 02:30:06.664]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:06.664 --> 02:30:10.406]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:10.406 --> 02:30:12.827]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:12.827 --> 02:30:18.711]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:18.711 --> 02:30:24.914]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:25.354 --> 02:30:31.337]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:31.337 --> 02:30:35.519]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:35.519 --> 02:30:39.802]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:39.802 --> 02:30:45.765]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:45.765 --> 02:30:49.307]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:49.307 --> 02:30:51.288]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:51.288 --> 02:30:51.728]  It's here.

[02:31:01.074 --> 02:31:02.235]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:02.235 --> 02:31:09.180]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:09.180 --> 02:31:11.741]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.741 --> 02:31:16.905]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:17.105 --> 02:31:20.147]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:20.147 --> 02:31:22.469]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:28.713]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.713 --> 02:31:32.096]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:32.096 --> 02:31:37.880]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:39.521]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.521 --> 02:31:40.822]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.822 --> 02:31:43.504]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.504 --> 02:31:44.905]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:31:45.185 --> 02:31:47.709]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.709 --> 02:31:52.336]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:52.336 --> 02:31:54.919]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:31:54.919 --> 02:31:58.805]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:58.805 --> 02:31:59.807]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:02.102 --> 02:32:06.806]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:32:06.806 --> 02:32:13.233]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:32:13.233 --> 02:32:15.515]  Number one, study the past.
[02:32:15.515 --> 02:32:17.897]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:32:17.897 --> 02:32:21.640]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:32:22.751 --> 02:32:25.832]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:32:25.832 --> 02:32:29.672]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:32:29.672 --> 02:32:34.714]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:32:34.714 --> 02:32:38.734]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:32:38.734 --> 02:32:42.135]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:32:42.135 --> 02:32:46.016]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:32:46.616 --> 02:32:51.560]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:56.184]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:32:56.184 --> 02:32:58.866]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:33:11.034 --> 02:33:12.436]  We're good.
[02:33:19.764 --> 02:33:22.265]  Okay, we will get to your phone calls coming up here.
[02:33:22.265 --> 02:33:23.365]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:23.365 --> 02:33:23.425]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:23.425 --> 02:33:24.545]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[02:33:24.545 --> 02:33:30.447]  Don't forget, starting in just three and a half days, September 1st, we're going to have a news program every night, Monday through Friday, at 7 p.m.
[02:33:30.447 --> 02:33:30.627]  That way,
[02:33:48.311 --> 02:33:54.896]  It forces me to be focused, condensed, but hard-hitting and only squeeze in the most important information.
[02:33:54.896 --> 02:33:56.658]  And I think that...
[02:33:57.779 --> 02:34:07.804]  We're gonna end up probably putting more information in 30 minutes than we do in three hours because I've seen the special reports we've done that are really a beta test for the nightly news.
[02:34:07.804 --> 02:34:19.310]  We're still gonna have the special reports as well and people love them and they're informative and it makes me be focused and I've also done talk radio so long I do a good job but I kind of get too comfortable.
[02:34:20.919 --> 02:34:24.383]  When I'm doing TV, and I do it without a teleprompter.
[02:34:24.383 --> 02:34:26.726]  By the way, this is teleprompter-free television.
[02:34:26.726 --> 02:34:28.649]  I've got to be absolutely focused.
[02:34:28.649 --> 02:34:37.620]  I've got two minutes to talk, to cover three or four subjects, and then go to a news piece, and then come back and spend a minute analyzing it.
[02:34:37.620 --> 02:34:39.322]  So it's more of like an intelligence briefing.
[02:34:40.345 --> 02:34:45.447]  This is all about the explosion of the alternative media to the next level.
[02:34:45.447 --> 02:34:48.288]  Tomorrow's network 10 years ago.
[02:34:48.288 --> 02:34:51.409]  And we're just simply taking it to a new level today.
[02:34:51.409 --> 02:34:55.091]  And your PrisonPlanet.TV memberships make it possible.
[02:34:55.091 --> 02:34:59.132]  So please get a PrisonPlanet.TV membership today.
[02:34:59.132 --> 02:35:01.053]  By the way, a little secret.
[02:35:01.053 --> 02:35:07.455]  I have it turned up where when you're logged in on the passcode, the passcode can be logged in six
[02:35:10.478 --> 02:35:12.680]  Times at the same time.
[02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:16.745]  So don't share it with too many people just because I can't afford the bandwidth.
[02:35:16.745 --> 02:35:18.466]  But I said, you know what?
[02:35:18.466 --> 02:35:23.031]  In non-peak times and stuff, we can handle this for every person that logs in.
[02:35:23.988 --> 02:35:28.830]  For a person that gets a $5.95 a month membership, you can share it with five other people.
[02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:36.212]  But just tell them, hey, if you share it with too many folks, if more than six of us log in with this, it's gonna block us.
[02:35:36.212 --> 02:35:36.853]  Okay?
[02:35:36.853 --> 02:35:41.094]  So really, you buy one membership, you get five free.
[02:35:41.094 --> 02:35:43.175]  $5.95 a month, 15 cents a day.
[02:35:43.175 --> 02:35:45.796]  We're hiring reporters, webmasters, writers.
[02:35:46.836 --> 02:35:50.719]  Which is a chore in itself, just to vet people and train them.
[02:35:50.719 --> 02:35:53.001]  But it's very exciting, the team we've got.
[02:35:53.001 --> 02:35:54.082]  They've done a great job.
[02:35:54.082 --> 02:35:58.986]  And also, help us spread the word about InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:35:58.986 --> 02:36:01.008]  By the way, Ron Paul is on with us Wednesday.
[02:36:01.991 --> 02:36:03.151]  I'm excited about that.
[02:36:03.151 --> 02:36:07.672]  We've got some other huge guests every night that are going to be on that TV show.
[02:36:07.672 --> 02:36:11.113]  We're going to have guests, news packages, reporters in the field.
[02:36:11.113 --> 02:36:15.895]  I mean, have you seen the special reports we posted on my YouTube channel?
[02:36:15.895 --> 02:36:20.176]  My wife and family, who are normally critical, because I ask them to be critical, they're like, no, this is incredible.
[02:36:20.176 --> 02:36:20.956]  This is really good.
[02:36:21.576 --> 02:36:23.017]  And Mike Adams has agreed.
[02:36:23.017 --> 02:36:26.159]  Sometimes he'll be a fill-in host on the Nightly News.
[02:36:26.159 --> 02:36:27.600]  Aaron Dykes.
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:29.682]  We've got Darren McBreen here.
[02:36:29.682 --> 02:36:30.342]  Great reporter.
[02:36:30.342 --> 02:36:32.203]  Worked for big national outfits.
[02:36:32.203 --> 02:36:37.026]  And if we get more members, and if we're able to pay for it, right now there's no sponsors.
[02:36:37.026 --> 02:36:38.147]  We haven't even sold sponsors yet.
[02:36:38.147 --> 02:36:39.668]  There's going to be a few sponsors.
[02:36:39.668 --> 02:36:41.229]  We'll be able to really start building.
[02:36:42.310 --> 02:36:43.811]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[02:36:43.811 --> 02:36:45.892]  We're going to start having health shows.
[02:36:45.892 --> 02:36:52.956]  We're going to start having firearms, Second Amendment programs, national sovereignty, intelligence reports.
[02:36:52.956 --> 02:36:59.841]  I intend, if this takes off, to bring in whole teams of people and it's not just going to be PrisonPlanet.tv anymore.
[02:37:00.521 --> 02:37:03.702]  It's going to be a springboard onto television.
[02:37:03.702 --> 02:37:04.242]  Okay?
[02:37:04.242 --> 02:37:07.663]  I could already be on television, but it's this little network, this cable system.
[02:37:07.663 --> 02:37:08.123]  That's great!
[02:37:08.123 --> 02:37:11.004]  We're going to be on those within just a few months, because they're out there.
[02:37:11.004 --> 02:37:11.385]  They want them.
[02:37:11.385 --> 02:37:16.546]  I've got to have the deployment system where it's fiber-optically sent up to these hubs.
[02:37:16.546 --> 02:37:19.627]  I've got to pay for the tens of thousands of dollars of equipment on that.
[02:37:19.627 --> 02:37:24.249]  We're just getting it launched, but you're going to see more, more, more, more, more.
[02:37:24.249 --> 02:37:26.289]  And again, we're stepping up here.
[02:37:26.289 --> 02:37:27.730]  The fact that we've had such a big effect
[02:37:28.490 --> 02:37:30.092]  Is the reason I'm doing this.
[02:37:30.092 --> 02:37:36.860]  Now Mike Adams, again, people like Mike Adams with hardcore key news in here with us.
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:39.704]  This platform is about empowering them as well.
[02:37:39.704 --> 02:37:43.909]  That's what Natural News does, is empowers millions of other people around the world.
[02:37:44.509 --> 02:37:54.054]  There's not many things that are similar to InfoWars, but Natural News is certainly something that, in a lot of ways, is doing the same thing and even surpassing us, Mike.
[02:37:54.054 --> 02:37:55.515]  And that's a good feeling.
[02:37:55.515 --> 02:37:57.616]  Because I'm not in competition with people.
[02:37:57.616 --> 02:37:59.677]  I wish there were 5,000 Mike Adams and 5,000 Alex Joneses.
[02:38:01.598 --> 02:38:03.560]  Yeah, I feel exactly the same way about it.
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:05.722]  That's why I love to fill in for you whenever I'm asked.
[02:38:05.722 --> 02:38:09.305]  And I wrote this article about you about a week ago.
[02:38:09.305 --> 02:38:14.169]  I don't know if you saw it, but I even said in the article, look, I never asked for compensation or anything like that.
[02:38:14.169 --> 02:38:18.013]  This is about patriots, you know, banding together to put the truth out there.
[02:38:18.013 --> 02:38:19.074]  There's no competition.
[02:38:19.074 --> 02:38:22.997]  It's total cooperation about informing people, educating people.
[02:38:22.997 --> 02:38:24.499]  We cover more health and food freedom.
[02:38:24.499 --> 02:38:26.580]  They're murdering people knowingly!
[02:38:26.580 --> 02:38:28.082]  These are cold-blooded Hitlers!
[02:38:28.422 --> 02:38:29.403]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:38:29.403 --> 02:38:31.904]  We all gotta rise up and just play a role in this.
[02:38:31.904 --> 02:38:35.407]  Whenever we are called to play a role, we gotta jump on that.
[02:38:35.407 --> 02:38:36.667]  That's why you're getting into music.
[02:38:36.667 --> 02:38:37.928]  Let me tell you, you're talented.
[02:38:37.928 --> 02:38:43.932]  My wife likes that genre of kind of pop, rap, and other people in the office do, and they say, that's good.
[02:38:43.932 --> 02:38:46.934]  I mean, I know that most of it tortures my ears.
[02:38:46.934 --> 02:38:50.957]  You know, the kind of pop stuff, I like some of the old school stuff.
[02:38:50.957 --> 02:38:52.478]  But yours, I actually enjoyed it.
[02:38:52.978 --> 02:38:53.658]  Hey, thanks, man.
[02:38:53.658 --> 02:38:53.898]  Thanks.
[02:38:53.898 --> 02:38:55.499]  Well, we have a couple more songs coming out.
[02:38:55.499 --> 02:38:57.259]  And it has a very positive message.
[02:38:57.259 --> 02:38:59.559]  That's a real positive song.
[02:38:59.559 --> 02:39:05.761]  I wrote the words to that really a year ago before things got darker out there.
[02:39:05.761 --> 02:39:08.461]  I think if I were to write it now, it might be a little more edgy.
[02:39:08.461 --> 02:39:13.662]  But nevertheless, I know you wanted to get into the FDA and its KGB tactics.
[02:39:13.662 --> 02:39:14.623]  Is that where you want to go?
[02:39:14.623 --> 02:39:16.663]  Yeah, but first tell us about the new rap icon.
[02:39:17.458 --> 02:39:19.319]  Oh, oh, well, I... The new character.
[02:39:19.319 --> 02:39:20.079]  Oh, man, okay.
[02:39:20.079 --> 02:39:28.242]  Well, I launched an artist label, an artist named Ametheos, and that's at ametheos.com.
[02:39:28.242 --> 02:39:29.403]  Is that Greek?
[02:39:29.403 --> 02:39:39.106]  Well, it's sort of supposed to sound Greek-ish, but the truth is, to me, ame, from the Latin root, means love and compassion.
[02:39:39.106 --> 02:39:44.388]  And theos is indicative of theology or spirituality or higher power.
[02:39:44.388 --> 02:39:45.729]  So, the religion of love.
[02:39:46.209 --> 02:39:47.810]  Really, that's really what it comes down to.
[02:39:47.810 --> 02:39:54.914]  And actually, if you think about it, Alex, most of what we do here in sort of the patriot movement or the alternative media is about compassion.
[02:39:54.914 --> 02:39:56.915]  We're trying to save people's lives.
[02:39:56.915 --> 02:40:03.599]  We're trying to awaken people to a... We're actually like, wow, they're putting radioactive isotopes in the water, not just fluoride.
[02:40:03.599 --> 02:40:04.899]  I'm angry about this.
[02:40:04.899 --> 02:40:06.060]  I want to warn other people.
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:08.961]  I call us the normal movement.
[02:40:08.961 --> 02:40:10.581]  It's normal to be concerned.
[02:40:10.581 --> 02:40:13.582]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:40:13.582 --> 02:40:18.644]  Some of the crazy critics think that we do this out of fear or hate.
[02:40:18.644 --> 02:40:19.364]  Not at all.
[02:40:19.364 --> 02:40:33.009]  We do this out of compassion because we want to help our fellow human beings survive and be informed and be aware and be prepared and be able to defend themselves and their families, grow their own food, stand up for their liberties.
[02:40:33.009 --> 02:40:35.230]  That comes out of love, ultimately, Alex.
[02:40:35.390 --> 02:40:38.352]  And I know that word maybe isn't tossed around here a lot.
[02:40:38.352 --> 02:40:39.412]  Well, it's al-Qaeda.
[02:40:39.412 --> 02:40:41.613]  But it's, ultimately, that's what it comes down to.
[02:40:41.613 --> 02:40:42.934]  We love our fellow human beings.
[02:40:42.934 --> 02:40:43.695]  We love freedom.
[02:40:43.695 --> 02:40:44.575]  We love liberty.
[02:40:44.575 --> 02:40:45.956]  And we're willing to fight for it.
[02:40:45.956 --> 02:40:46.756]  And sing for it.
[02:40:46.756 --> 02:40:47.937]  And rap for it.
[02:40:47.937 --> 02:40:48.657]  You know?
[02:40:48.657 --> 02:40:49.358]  I love it.
[02:40:49.358 --> 02:40:50.638]  It's pure genius.
[02:40:50.638 --> 02:40:52.500]  So give us Theomethio's website.
[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:56.222]  Well, A-M-E-T-H-I-O-S dot com.
[02:40:56.222 --> 02:40:57.822]  Or go to naturalnews.com.
[02:40:57.822 --> 02:40:58.103]  Okay.
[02:41:00.205 --> 02:41:05.607]  Just finishing up the last story, that you've got this government created group that operates as independent.
[02:41:07.177 --> 02:41:09.558]  Uh, and claims it only gets private funding.
[02:41:09.558 --> 02:41:11.820]  A perfect non-governmental organization.
[02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:23.406]  And then it turns out 64.9% Department of Defense, Bill and Melinda Gates, which might as well be government, creepily going around lying because they've got a problem.
[02:41:23.406 --> 02:41:31.050]  They wanted to kill us with the vaccines and do all this and give us degenerative diseases which they profit from, but now it's coming out.
[02:41:32.248 --> 02:41:36.230]  As you mentioned, that these vaccines are totally screwing people up.
[02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:50.277]  Well, remember, this Institute of Medicine, this is the same group, Alex, that gave the recent vitamin D deficiency recommendations and warned we shouldn't take too much vitamin D. It said Americans should only have about 600 IUs of vitamin D. I take 10,000 a day.
[02:41:51.237 --> 02:42:04.881]  Thousands of scientists saying, you're not going to get these internal cancers cut in half, all this stuff, and they come out and say, don't do it, don't do it, because they know the sun, despite all these poisons, and I'm pretty unhealthy, I can go out and lay out for 30 minutes and feel rejuvenated.
[02:42:04.881 --> 02:42:05.942]  They're like, no!
[02:42:05.942 --> 02:42:07.622]  Be cave dwellers like us!
[02:42:07.622 --> 02:42:09.803]  The sun is evil, it's with Al Qaeda!
[02:42:09.803 --> 02:42:10.643]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[02:42:10.643 --> 02:42:12.124]  There's a whole fascinating history.
[02:42:12.944 --> 02:42:17.427]  This, the IOM, remember last year when the experiments on the Guatemalan prisoners came out?
[02:42:17.427 --> 02:42:20.730]  The illegal medical experiments funded by the U.S.
[02:42:20.730 --> 02:42:21.670]  government and the NIH?
[02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:23.912]  What, putting a loving syphilis in them?
[02:42:23.912 --> 02:42:25.153]  That's exactly what it was.
[02:42:25.153 --> 02:42:30.497]  And Obama said, oh, we have to appoint an investigative commission to look into this.
[02:42:30.497 --> 02:42:33.038]  And he turned to the IOM and said, we want you to investigate it.
[02:42:33.038 --> 02:42:33.779]  The very guy's doing it.
[02:42:33.919 --> 02:42:40.866]  The IOM had to recuse themselves because some of their members apparently had ties or were involved in these medical experiments.
[02:42:40.866 --> 02:42:41.066]  Of course!
[02:42:41.066 --> 02:42:43.749]  No, it's like, we'll get an investigation going right now!
[02:42:43.749 --> 02:42:48.894]  The investigation is found, we should fund these groups even more to make sure this doesn't happen in the future.
[02:42:48.894 --> 02:42:53.439]  They'll actually do that, they'll say, we need more funding because FEMA confiscated guns in New Orleans.
[02:42:54.087 --> 02:42:55.288]  Well, that's the FDA's line.
[02:42:55.288 --> 02:43:00.551]  We need more funding because the food is dangerous, even though they're the ones making the food dangerous.
[02:43:00.551 --> 02:43:10.116]  You know, they're the ones who looked the other way when Cargill brought in ground turkey, was distributing ground turkey contaminated with salmonella all across the country.
[02:43:10.116 --> 02:43:12.898]  Both the USDA and the FDA looked the other way.
[02:43:12.898 --> 02:43:20.142]  Did you know right now today, in terms of chicken sold in grocery stores, two-thirds of it is routinely contaminated with salmonella?
[02:43:20.931 --> 02:43:22.432]  Every single day.
[02:43:22.432 --> 02:43:23.692]  You don't hear a word about that.
[02:43:23.692 --> 02:43:28.794]  All you hear is about how dangerous the raw milk is, which isn't even dangerous at all.
[02:43:28.794 --> 02:43:33.216]  They've written regulations to legalize vaccines killing people.
[02:43:33.216 --> 02:43:38.538]  Well, the Vaccine Damage Fund law says we can, because it's government mandated, the government said so.
[02:43:38.538 --> 02:43:46.121]  Oh, we're allowed to sell you rotten beef, rotten pork, rotten chicken, because we radiate it now, because the government said we're allowed to.
[02:43:46.121 --> 02:43:49.142]  Oh, the government says Walmart can inject water into their food.
[02:43:50.356 --> 02:43:51.637]  Yeah, right.
[02:43:51.637 --> 02:44:01.564]  That's why I love being in Texas, by the way, because you go out to the farmers markets and I go out and there's a local producer of free-range beef.
[02:44:01.564 --> 02:44:03.606]  And I buy these beef bones for my dog.
[02:44:03.606 --> 02:44:05.127]  That's Al-Qaeda meetings.
[02:44:06.368 --> 02:44:09.850]  And we raise chickens now, and we're getting eggs every day.
[02:44:09.850 --> 02:44:14.453]  So we're eating our own chicken eggs that are produced right on our own farm.
[02:44:14.453 --> 02:44:15.754]  And it's beautiful.
[02:44:15.754 --> 02:44:20.157]  And I keep wondering, when is the FDA going to come raid my little chicken house?
[02:44:20.157 --> 02:44:28.543]  Oh, I saw an article a few days ago where even in cities where they have laws that you can have chickens, they're raiding people and fining them now.
[02:44:28.543 --> 02:44:31.325]  Yeah, well, clearly it's very criminal activity.
[02:44:32.848 --> 02:44:34.989]  FDA spies, we gotta get into that.
[02:44:34.989 --> 02:44:37.190]  Yeah, go ahead, take it away.
[02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:48.415]  Alright, so we had after the Rawsome Food Raids, which of course the SWAT style armed FDA led raids on these raw dairy producers in Venice, California.
[02:44:48.415 --> 02:44:55.279]  After that happened, we had three informants approach us with information about the FDA creating a spy network.
[02:44:56.039 --> 02:45:00.000]  Of infiltrators who are infiltrating the raw dairy movement.
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:01.220]  They've been right here in Austin.
[02:45:01.220 --> 02:45:02.400]  Nobody's hiding it.
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:05.481]  It's totally legal and there's these weird creeps creeping around.
[02:45:05.481 --> 02:45:07.161]  Well, yeah, they're trained by the FDA.
[02:45:07.161 --> 02:45:11.722]  The FDA trains them in social engineering techniques and KGB style techniques.
[02:45:11.722 --> 02:45:19.123]  And it turns out that most of them are women, by the way, because women can go in and give a story of, I have a child that I can't breastfeed.
[02:45:19.123 --> 02:45:22.104]  That's why I need raw goat's milk to keep my baby alive.
[02:45:22.244 --> 02:45:25.385]  They did that with the Amish and they'll even beg until they agree to sell them.
[02:45:25.385 --> 02:45:27.565]  Well, I only sell those to my neighbors.
[02:45:27.565 --> 02:45:29.505]  Please, sir, please.
[02:45:29.505 --> 02:45:31.346]  I want to SWAT team you so bad.
[02:45:31.346 --> 02:45:31.946]  That's it.
[02:45:31.946 --> 02:45:32.746]  And they'll name drop.
[02:45:32.746 --> 02:45:41.047]  They'll say, oh, I talked to Farmer Joe over here and he said I should talk to you because you're the inside source for raw goat's milk to keep my baby alive.
[02:45:41.047 --> 02:45:42.288]  But it's all a lie.
[02:45:42.288 --> 02:45:49.769]  These are all FDA infiltrators and spies who are setting up these farmers for entrapment to be raided.
[02:45:49.969 --> 02:45:52.590]  And of course, the FDA pushing death and destruction.
[02:45:52.590 --> 02:45:55.251]  Now anything wholesome and good is bad.
[02:45:55.251 --> 02:45:58.572]  Sunlight is evil.
[02:45:58.572 --> 02:46:04.013]  Cass Sunstein said they should pass a law to arrest people that say sunlight's good for you.
[02:46:04.013 --> 02:46:04.834]  What did he attack?
[02:46:04.834 --> 02:46:05.374]  Sunlight?
[02:46:05.374 --> 02:46:07.394]  9-11 truth?
[02:46:07.394 --> 02:46:09.155]  And people that don't believe in man-made global warming?
[02:46:09.335 --> 02:46:18.860]  Look, we had an informant that told us the FDA sent armed men to their house, or at least men dressed in government uniforms that they assumed looked armed.
[02:46:18.860 --> 02:46:22.042]  I don't know if they wielded guns in their face or anything.
[02:46:22.042 --> 02:46:25.604]  But the men threatened this farmer and said, you don't sell raw dairy.
[02:46:26.304 --> 02:46:35.731]  And if you go public with us showing up at your house and verbally intimidating you, we're going to declare your dairy herd to be infected with mad cow disease and have them all destroyed.
[02:46:35.731 --> 02:46:37.132]  Oh, he should go public.
[02:46:37.132 --> 02:46:40.415]  This is the terrorist saying they'll frame you.
[02:46:40.415 --> 02:46:44.738]  Just like we have New York cops going, you're not allowed to protest, but we have a permit.
[02:46:44.738 --> 02:46:45.759]  We're going to take you to jail.
[02:46:45.759 --> 02:46:46.939]  Your camera's a gun.
[02:46:46.939 --> 02:46:52.884]  And the cops frame them and give them the camera because their superiors love frame-ups.
[02:46:52.884 --> 02:46:54.205]  I mean, this is pure evil.
[02:46:55.208 --> 02:46:59.651]  And for those who don't believe this, by the way, there's a movie coming out called Farmageddon.
[02:46:59.651 --> 02:47:02.733]  This is the documentary about some of these race.
[02:47:02.733 --> 02:47:05.595]  And the website is farmageddonmovie.com.
[02:47:05.595 --> 02:47:06.255]  When is that coming out?
[02:47:06.255 --> 02:47:07.156]  I want to get them on.
[02:47:07.156 --> 02:47:11.438]  It's being previewed, I think, in Chicago in a couple of days, but it's still in theaters.
[02:47:11.438 --> 02:47:12.539]  You can watch the trailer.
[02:47:12.539 --> 02:47:13.200]  Who's putting that out?
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:13.820]  I want to get them on.
[02:47:13.820 --> 02:47:15.781]  You know, it's a woman named
[02:47:17.142 --> 02:47:17.943]  Kimberly.
[02:47:17.943 --> 02:47:18.943]  No, Kristen, I'm sorry.
[02:47:18.943 --> 02:47:20.644]  Kristen, I can get you her phone numbers.
[02:47:20.644 --> 02:47:22.546]  Yeah, because we might want to carry that in the store.
[02:47:22.546 --> 02:47:35.514]  But this movie documents a case where the feds came into a sheep farm and declared that all the sheep were contaminated with mad cow disease and literally stole the sheep, took them away and had them all cremated.
[02:47:35.514 --> 02:47:37.356]  Well, it turns out that's what they did in England.
[02:47:37.356 --> 02:47:38.676]  It came out in the news.
[02:47:38.676 --> 02:47:42.019]  The government accidentally released weaponized foot and mouth.
[02:47:42.019 --> 02:47:43.079]  Remember in 2000?
[02:47:43.079 --> 02:47:43.480]  I remember.
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:46.842]  And then killed almost the entire sheep and cow herd except for Big Agra.
[02:47:47.322 --> 02:47:48.103]  Yeah.
[02:47:48.103 --> 02:47:52.586]  They literally destroyed everybody and then wouldn't let people set back up.
[02:47:52.586 --> 02:47:54.287]  Is that not genius?
[02:47:54.287 --> 02:47:56.909]  Well, it's incredible, but it shows you the lengths they'll go to.
[02:47:56.909 --> 02:48:09.297]  I mean, these are animal murderers for one thing, but they're also human murderers in the sense that they would go in and raid the raw food outfits to deny children their nutrition.
[02:48:09.297 --> 02:48:11.158]  A lot of parents were buying the raw milk.
[02:48:11.158 --> 02:48:12.599]  But then lie and say, we are
[02:48:17.222 --> 02:48:21.065]  You know, we know your sheep don't have mad cow, mad sheep.
[02:48:21.065 --> 02:48:22.387]  We're just going to say it.
[02:48:22.387 --> 02:48:23.147]  Yes.
[02:48:23.147 --> 02:48:27.631]  It shows how they use the threat of contagion as their total excuse.
[02:48:27.631 --> 02:48:36.038]  And what we're seeing is a militarization of the FDA, which extends to the IOM and the military ties that we sort of touched on.
[02:48:36.038 --> 02:48:38.841]  The Department of Education, without warrants, is now kicking down doors.
[02:48:39.301 --> 02:48:43.103]  Yeah, and I understand tomorrow you're going to have the CEO of Gibson Guitars on.
[02:48:43.103 --> 02:48:43.724]  Yes.
[02:48:43.724 --> 02:48:45.845]  They were raided by the feds for what?
[02:48:45.845 --> 02:48:46.766]  Illegal wood?
[02:48:47.816 --> 02:48:49.997]  Now, do you realize where they could go with this?
[02:48:49.997 --> 02:48:54.519]  If the wood in your guitar is illegal, they could say the wood stock on your firearm is illegal.
[02:48:54.519 --> 02:48:55.440]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:56.720]  They admit that!
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:58.301]  They do?
[02:48:58.301 --> 02:49:01.983]  That's why I wanted to cover this over the weekend and I never did because I got busy on other subjects.
[02:49:01.983 --> 02:49:10.386]  It was even in the Wall Street Journal and other articles that now they're going to go back to even hundred-year-old guitars, pianos, guns.
[02:49:10.386 --> 02:49:10.767]  Incredible.
[02:49:10.767 --> 02:49:12.727]  And if it's from any of these countries now,
[02:49:13.948 --> 02:49:14.829]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:49:14.829 --> 02:49:17.511]  You're going to be SWAT teamed, so exactly.
[02:49:17.511 --> 02:49:21.794]  The government didn't enough to make drugs illegal, and then come after people for drugs they bring in.
[02:49:21.794 --> 02:49:42.028]  Now it's going to be light bulbs, which they're now coming after folks for, the wrong kind of power, the wrong kind of washing machine, wood, and they're admitting they're now raiding people over guitars that are even 60 years old, and when you try to fly out of the country with them, if you can't prove, no matter what it is, where the wood came from, they're taking it!
[02:49:42.952 --> 02:49:43.953]  It's incredible.
[02:49:43.953 --> 02:49:46.314]  It's a total authoritarianism.
[02:49:46.314 --> 02:49:49.335]  I'm sure this is another reason for them to try to arrest Willie Nelson, by the way.
[02:49:49.335 --> 02:49:51.136]  They go after his guitars now.
[02:49:51.136 --> 02:49:52.837]  But do you realize where they could extend this?
[02:49:52.837 --> 02:49:53.818]  What's the name of his guitar?
[02:49:53.818 --> 02:49:54.178]  Trigger?
[02:49:54.178 --> 02:49:55.438]  The one he's had so long?
[02:49:55.438 --> 02:49:56.539]  I've actually touched Trigger.
[02:49:56.539 --> 02:49:56.899]  Oh, really?
[02:49:56.899 --> 02:49:58.240]  He's had it since he was a kid.
[02:49:58.240 --> 02:49:59.340]  Well, that's it for that thing.
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:00.601]  Trigger's an Al-Qaeda instrument now.
[02:50:00.601 --> 02:50:04.163]  Guys, let's put Trigger up there that he bought in Texas like 65 years ago.
[02:50:04.163 --> 02:50:09.225]  I think he was about 11 when he got it, so I guess it was like 70 years ago.
[02:50:09.225 --> 02:50:09.485]  He's like 76.
[02:50:10.486 --> 02:50:19.089]  But look, if they can outlaw materials now, they could say, well, the gallium in your solar panels is illegal from China.
[02:50:19.089 --> 02:50:22.290]  So all gallium is illegal and they could confiscate all solar panels.
[02:50:22.290 --> 02:50:22.590]  No, no, no.
[02:50:22.590 --> 02:50:23.690]  That's the new system.
[02:50:23.690 --> 02:50:29.072]  The Green Police are there to make sure you get bisphenol A. They're there to make sure you don't get your vitamins.
[02:50:29.072 --> 02:50:30.033]  I mean, I've checked it.
[02:50:30.033 --> 02:50:33.934]  They're going after everything that doesn't matter while ignoring the GMO.
[02:50:34.654 --> 02:50:36.495]  Well, you're exactly right.
[02:50:36.495 --> 02:50:39.476]  GMOs are genetically contaminating our world.
[02:50:39.476 --> 02:50:52.261]  Suicides of farmers are at record levels throughout India, and I think we're going to see more farmer suicides in the U.S., maybe even in Texas, because the drought combined with GMO failures is just driving people to real misery.
[02:50:52.261 --> 02:50:54.041]  You know what, Mike Adams?
[02:50:54.041 --> 02:50:55.782]  We're going into overdrive.
[02:50:55.782 --> 02:50:58.023]  I've got a bunch of meetings I've got to do for the TV show.
[02:50:58.023 --> 02:51:00.644]  How would you like to host the show for an hour coming up?
[02:51:01.344 --> 02:51:05.285]  Are you tired of spending money for metal canning lids year after year?
[02:51:05.285 --> 02:51:06.466]  Then stop!
[02:51:06.466 --> 02:51:09.907]  Stop buying metal lids and get Tattler Reusable Canning Lids.
[02:51:09.907 --> 02:51:17.009]  Made of USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, Tattler Canning Lids let you safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[02:51:17.409 --> 02:51:29.878]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways that contain BPA, but Tattler canning lids are indefinitely reusable and guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning, and contain no BPA.
[02:51:29.878 --> 02:51:39.885]  Tattler lids are dishwasher safe, perfect for standard pressure or water bath canning, eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion, fit standard mason jars, and are proudly made in the USA.
[02:51:40.345 --> 02:51:41.746]  Place orders by phone at 877-747-2793.
[02:51:41.746 --> 02:51:42.626]  Or go to reusablecanninglids.com.
[02:51:42.626 --> 02:51:43.107]  That's 1-877-747-2793.
[02:51:43.107 --> 02:51:44.467]  Or go to reusablecanninglids.com.
[02:51:44.467 --> 02:51:45.628]  That's reusablecanninglids.com.
[02:51:45.628 --> 02:51:46.969]  Tattler Reusable Canning Lids.
[02:51:46.969 --> 02:51:47.549]  The original since 1976.
[02:52:01.004 --> 02:52:06.850]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[02:52:06.850 --> 02:52:10.073]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.
[02:52:10.073 --> 02:52:21.364]  We promote premium quality health, energy, and skincare products using dynamic, caring personalities and state-of-the-art media technology to spread a powerful message of health.
[02:52:21.684 --> 02:52:23.985]  Wealth, longevity, and freedom.
[02:52:23.985 --> 02:52:31.490]  This low-cost business opportunity is designed for full-time or part-time so you can work as little or as much as you'd like.
[02:52:31.490 --> 02:52:33.871]  It is you that defines the reward level.
[02:52:33.871 --> 02:52:41.056]  Whether you are seeking a few hundred extra dollars per month or a six or even seven figure annual income, it's up to you.
[02:52:41.056 --> 02:52:42.076]  Want to find out more?
[02:52:42.076 --> 02:52:48.480]  Shoot an email with InfoWars Team in the subject line to InfoWars Team Coordinator, MZ, and tell him a little bit about yourself.
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:51.623]  That's the initials MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[02:52:51.623 --> 02:52:54.105]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[02:52:54.105 --> 02:52:57.868]  I only promote products that I truly believe in, and these are phenomenal.
[02:52:57.868 --> 02:53:00.911]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[02:53:00.911 --> 02:53:04.074]  Why is it so many people suffer from so many illnesses today?
[02:53:04.074 --> 02:53:05.936]  Why don't doctors know how to help you?
[02:53:05.936 --> 02:53:11.101]  Could it be that our doctors don't know how because there's a nutrition solution and they only know about drugs?
[02:53:11.621 --> 02:53:15.904]  Over 68 diseases are known to be connected to a deficiency of glutathione.
[02:53:15.904 --> 02:53:20.828]  The missing ingredient to increasing your body's production of glutathione is cysteine.
[02:53:20.828 --> 02:53:33.657]  Raising your glutathione production protects you from cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[02:53:33.657 --> 02:53:36.639]  Nature's richest source of cysteine is unheated whey.
[02:53:37.359 --> 02:53:37.639]  Thank you.
[02:54:12.515 --> 02:54:29.344]  Listen, Mike Adams is going to do 30 minutes of overdrive at PrisonPlanet.tv and on the audio streams at Infowars.com that will all be archived to PrisonPlanet.tv and then shot out across the web to the four corners of the planet.
[02:54:29.744 --> 02:54:38.328]  And he's going to do that overdrive and go to the callers that are patiently holding as well after he continues to get into some of the other news that he has here with us today.
[02:54:38.328 --> 02:54:45.031]  So even when I'm off getting ready for the TV show, somebody like Mike Adams comes in here and we'll throw him in front of the microphone.
[02:54:45.031 --> 02:54:45.431]  He's a great...
[02:54:45.871 --> 02:54:49.633]  Great radio talk show host, but for the official show that ends in about five minutes.
[02:54:49.633 --> 02:54:52.174]  I'll be back tomorrow, obviously 11 a.m.
[02:54:52.174 --> 02:54:54.055]  Central Standard Time.
[02:54:54.055 --> 02:54:57.837]  We got Ron Paul coming up on Wednesday and a bunch of other big guests throughout the week.
[02:54:57.837 --> 02:55:04.000]  And we're also getting some of the people on from Gibson as well to talk about their rate.
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:10.263]  And by the way, the government already rated them two years ago and had to admit, had to admit that
[02:55:14.855 --> 02:55:25.168]  I had to admit that they had already rated him before, and that they had been not guilty of that, and they're buying the certified wood.
[02:55:25.168 --> 02:55:32.758]  But it's about wood instead of, we're chemtrailing you, we're modifying the crops, we're splicing all these animals together.
[02:55:34.355 --> 02:55:37.377]  They really don't have any justification, Alex, to raid them.
[02:55:37.377 --> 02:55:38.538]  This is what the U.S.
[02:55:38.538 --> 02:55:39.799]  is turning into.
[02:55:39.799 --> 02:55:45.123]  The federal regulators are now just, they're just raiding you as a nuisance tactic.
[02:55:45.123 --> 02:55:51.108]  They have no law on their side, and the law has been thrown out, even throughout the executive branch.
[02:55:51.108 --> 02:55:59.454]  It's a bunch of control freak parasites who act like complete, that's when you wake up to corruption, is when the cops are saying, we're going to frame you and stuff.
[02:55:59.454 --> 02:56:01.556]  You're like, wow, you're really a criminal.
[02:56:01.556 --> 02:56:02.997]  The government's really criminal.
[02:56:03.317 --> 02:56:05.118]  Hey, people are waking up all over the place now.
[02:56:05.118 --> 02:56:12.199]  I mean, the raw dairy thing woke up a lot of people in California who really weren't paying attention to the coming police state until this happened.
[02:56:12.199 --> 02:56:16.120]  Now, Gibson Guitar Raid, this is waking up a lot of people throughout the music industry.
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:24.782]  Thousands of lemonade stands and even Forbes had to admit this is about cracking down on grassroots activity, making you go to big box stores.
[02:56:24.782 --> 02:56:27.543]  They don't want humans doing normal human activities.
[02:56:27.543 --> 02:56:27.883]  Right.
[02:56:27.883 --> 02:56:30.604]  Well, I can't wait for them to outlaw rock and roll.
[02:56:31.144 --> 02:56:38.790]  Just start raiding record stores for no reason, because I don't know, there's BPA in the vinyl or something.
[02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:39.771]  Who knows what they'll come up with?
[02:56:39.771 --> 02:56:41.072]  It's just some crazy idea.
[02:56:41.072 --> 02:56:42.252]  It's all about power grabs.
[02:56:42.252 --> 02:56:45.755]  They're just training us to accept bizarre behavior.
[02:56:45.755 --> 02:56:46.516]  Well, that's what it is.
[02:56:46.516 --> 02:56:54.522]  And as long as they keep doing this, they're actually sort of working for us because they're creating the reaction.
[02:56:54.522 --> 02:56:57.304]  As you say, for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:56:57.304 --> 02:56:59.305]  Every time they conduct an unjustified
[02:57:00.206 --> 02:57:01.486]  Illegal raid.
[02:57:01.486 --> 02:57:11.490]  They wake up another sector of society that says, wait a minute, this is not a free country anymore, and we must take a stand and fight for our liberties, otherwise we're going to lose them.
[02:57:11.490 --> 02:57:19.912]  I saw The Atlantic, being a big liberal publication, saying, oh my gosh, how do you make musicians, tea partiers, take their guitars?
[02:57:19.912 --> 02:57:21.713]  And they said, the whole internet's on fire.
[02:57:21.713 --> 02:57:26.214]  Thousands of musician sites are totally angry and don't believe in our global warming takeover.
[02:57:26.214 --> 02:57:27.235]  We've got to be nicer.
[02:57:28.836 --> 02:57:31.260]  Again, they don't want to move their Green Police too quick.
[02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:33.803]  It's like, we'll micromanage everybody later.
[02:57:33.803 --> 02:57:37.408]  First, just start taxing their fuel.
[02:57:37.408 --> 02:57:40.032]  Let's get the horse in the back of the trailer.
[02:57:40.032 --> 02:57:42.014]  Don't let them know we're taking them to a glue factory.
[02:57:42.659 --> 02:57:44.180]  But it is like they're in a hurry now.
[02:57:44.180 --> 02:57:55.924]  They seem to be accelerating and escalating these raids and the attempts to outlaw dietary supplements, which, by the way, the Institute of Medicine has been in favor of for a long time, actually issued a position paper on that.
[02:57:55.924 --> 02:58:05.988]  We've got a big call-in day coming up September 8th, a nationwide call-in day to complain about the FDA's attempt to outlaw dietary supplements that we covered here on your show weeks ago.
[02:58:05.988 --> 02:58:07.009]  That issue is still out there.
[02:58:07.429 --> 02:58:14.292]  They're going to keep trying to outlaw our music instruments, our food, our supplements.
[02:58:14.292 --> 02:58:16.432]  Who knows what else they're going to go after, Alex?
[02:58:16.432 --> 02:58:17.293]  Firearms, of course.
[02:58:17.293 --> 02:58:18.973]  That goes without saying.
[02:58:18.973 --> 02:58:22.875]  But what else is on their target list next to go after?
[02:58:22.875 --> 02:58:24.415]  Everything is.
[02:58:24.415 --> 02:58:27.537]  They've got to ship guns into Mexico to blame it on the Second Amendment.
[02:58:27.537 --> 02:58:28.777]  They're going to do it.
[02:58:28.777 --> 02:58:31.198]  That's it for the official transmission.
[02:58:31.198 --> 02:58:32.779]  We're going to be back in one minute.
[02:58:34.159 --> 02:58:36.502]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:36.502 --> 02:58:37.723]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.805 --> 02:58:56.829]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.829 --> 02:59:00.073]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:59:00.073 --> 02:59:04.858]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.858 --> 02:59:11.265]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:11.265 --> 02:59:13.508]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:14.028 --> 02:59:14.328]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:14.328 --> 02:59:14.849]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.849 --> 02:59:15.489]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.489 --> 02:59:16.190]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.190 --> 02:59:18.291]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.941 --> 02:59:34.802]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.802 --> 02:59:40.224]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:40.224 --> 02:59:52.370]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:52.370 --> 02:59:55.951]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.951 --> 02:59:59.152]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:04.917 --> 03:00:05.658]  I don't think so.
[03:00:33.424 --> 03:00:34.626]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:34.626 --> 03:00:40.315]  I'm the impromptu fill-in host here for the Overdrive Hour.
[03:00:40.315 --> 03:00:41.938]  Well, actually, we're going to do half an hour here.
[03:00:41.938 --> 03:00:45.503]  Alex just asked me to fill in, and I'm happy to do that because, as I mentioned earlier...
[03:00:46.653 --> 03:00:53.656]  We are all working together here to get the information out there that you need in order to be free, to stay free.
[03:00:53.656 --> 03:01:02.101]  And in this half an hour, I'm going to go into more details about the Institute of Medicine report that we were just talking about here with Alex.
[03:01:02.101 --> 03:01:05.863]  I'm going to talk about the FDA a little bit, and we're going to get to some of your calls.
[03:01:07.143 --> 03:01:10.665]  I noticed there are quite a few callers who have been on hold for some time.
[03:01:10.665 --> 03:01:19.691]  I want to get to you, and even if your subject is not FDA related, I'd be happy to take your call.
[03:01:19.691 --> 03:01:25.674]  Some of the trolls out there, if you try to call in thinking I'm going to be an easy target because I'm not the usual guest, I'm just going to hang up on you.
[03:01:25.674 --> 03:01:26.595]  So if you're going to call in,
[03:01:27.435 --> 03:01:32.217]  Be talking about freedom, and be on board with this program.
[03:01:32.217 --> 03:01:39.159]  If you just try to use this to attack Alex or something like that, you're not going to make any headway here whatsoever.
[03:01:39.159 --> 03:01:50.804]  Now, by the way, I just want to mention, and I appreciate Alex inviting me to fill in for this half hour, I wrote an article about a week ago called, Is Alex Jones For Real?
[03:01:52.046 --> 03:02:05.977]  And this article really lays out what I personally think about Alex Jones and why I'm here and why I really appreciate this team, the entire InfoWars team, and what they are doing and the way in which they approach things.
[03:02:05.977 --> 03:02:20.069]  It's a very effective, probably the most effective alternative media source on the web, on the radio, around the world right now that's spreading truth and the information you need to know about all the topics that really matter.
[03:02:20.629 --> 03:02:31.296]  The economy, politics, health freedom, food freedom, genetically modified foods, all of these issues, Alex Jones is breaking it down for you here every single day.
[03:02:31.296 --> 03:02:36.620]  Now, just for some background, so you know, look, there aren't too many people that I really admire.
[03:02:36.620 --> 03:02:38.321]  I mean, it's a very short list.
[03:02:38.321 --> 03:02:47.107]  It's people like Thomas Jefferson, it's people like Ron Paul, people like Samuel Adams, who I'm just lucky enough to share the last name with there.
[03:02:48.055 --> 03:02:55.919]  But in terms of people operating today and actually active people out there in the world, those who I admire, it's a very short list.
[03:02:55.919 --> 03:02:58.921]  Paul Craig Roberts, definitely on the list.
[03:02:58.921 --> 03:03:00.622]  But it's not a huge list.
[03:03:00.622 --> 03:03:06.085]  Alex Jones is someone I truly and honestly admire for his courage.
[03:03:06.085 --> 03:03:11.848]  And that's what I laid out in that story, which has been very widely read and very popular, actually.
[03:03:12.873 --> 03:03:25.103]  Because you gotta understand that people like Alex, and to some extent myself, we would really rather be out fishing somewhere, or having free time, or maybe even exercising on a treadmill.
[03:03:25.103 --> 03:03:29.907]  I mean, I've actually lost some of my exercise time because I'm working so hard on natural news.
[03:03:30.527 --> 03:03:44.892]  I've seen pictures of Alex Jones when he was pumping weights and super buff and, you know, he's put a lot of time into this and he hasn't had time to go do the personal exercise that I know he enjoys doing that he wants to do because he's sacrificing his time to be here to do this show.
[03:03:44.892 --> 03:03:47.953]  And I understand that because this is what patriots do.
[03:03:47.953 --> 03:03:48.734]  Committed people.
[03:03:49.494 --> 03:04:05.238]  This is what they do, because they're dedicated to spending their time making a difference in this world for your future, even if it means sacrificing some of their own time, even time with family sometimes, or personal time, time off.
[03:04:05.238 --> 03:04:07.078]  You don't see Alex taking time off.
[03:04:07.078 --> 03:04:08.319]  I don't take time off either.
[03:04:08.319 --> 03:04:12.019]  I just spent the weekend working on this Institute of Medicine report.
[03:04:12.019 --> 03:04:12.800]  But that's why I'm here.
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:13.940]  I just want to be on the record.
[03:04:15.100 --> 03:04:20.143]  Of why I'm here and why I'm really just humbled and happy to be part of this organization.
[03:04:20.143 --> 03:04:28.368]  And I know you understand that, especially the long-time InfoWars listeners, the big-time supporters, advocates of everything we're doing here.
[03:04:28.368 --> 03:04:35.552]  I thank you for your support and thank you for accepting me as a fill-in host here from time to time during Overdrive Hours.
[03:04:35.552 --> 03:04:38.693]  Now we're going to take a break and when we come back, I'm going to get right to your calls.
[03:04:38.693 --> 03:04:39.594]  Sorry to make you wait there.

[03:06:01.299 --> 03:06:02.720]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.720 --> 03:06:13.386]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:06:13.386 --> 03:06:16.048]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight
[03:06:16.328 --> 03:06:16.768]  I don't know.
[03:06:35.353 --> 03:06:41.495]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:06:41.495 --> 03:06:51.379]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:06:51.379 --> 03:06:52.879]  The war is here.
[03:06:52.879 --> 03:06:54.780]  It's an info war.
[03:06:54.780 --> 03:06:57.601]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:07:02.705 --> 03:07:09.429]  If you owe the IRS money you can't pay, then listen carefully, because you already know that the problem won't go away by itself.

[03:08:09.614 --> 03:08:13.776]  We are into overdrive here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:13.776 --> 03:08:17.657]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger, and we're going straight to your calls in this segment.
[03:08:17.657 --> 03:08:19.918]  Let's go to Roger in Missouri.
[03:08:19.918 --> 03:08:23.960]  Sorry for holding, for you holding so long, but what can I do for you today, Roger?
[03:08:23.960 --> 03:08:26.141]  Hello, Mike.
[03:08:26.141 --> 03:08:29.822]  I read your article and I agree with it 100%.
[03:08:29.822 --> 03:08:38.926]  And I, would you happen to be listening to the show a couple weeks ago when Alex had the farmers call in?
[03:08:39.653 --> 03:08:42.794]  Yes, I listened to that show, yes.
[03:08:42.794 --> 03:08:46.256]  Okay, I only got a call that was talking about the black helicopter.
[03:08:46.256 --> 03:08:48.757]  Oh, I remember, yeah, I remember your call, yeah.
[03:08:48.757 --> 03:08:53.319]  You said they were so close that you flipped them off and they flipped you back off as well, right?
[03:08:53.319 --> 03:08:54.619]  That was you?
[03:08:54.619 --> 03:08:55.520]  Yes.
[03:08:55.520 --> 03:08:57.340]  Okay.
[03:08:57.340 --> 03:09:00.082]  I don't believe in coincidences.
[03:09:00.082 --> 03:09:05.724]  In the very next Friday, at 10 minutes to 11, right before Alex's show came on,
[03:09:06.804 --> 03:09:16.306]  I was getting ready to go on a camping trip and me and a friend of mine was walking down the lane to feed my horses and guess what I heard?
[03:09:16.306 --> 03:09:34.391]  A helicopter coming and I turned around immediately and started back to the house and my friend didn't know what was going on and he said why are we going back to the house and I said well I'm going to get my rifle and I went and I just leaned it up against a tree and the black
[03:09:35.191 --> 03:09:45.195]  A black helicopter came right back, and he flew over two or three times, and you could tell they were trying to see who was there so far.
[03:09:45.195 --> 03:09:52.759]  I said, heck with it, and him and I just walked on down to feed the horses, and they hovered right on top of us.
[03:09:52.759 --> 03:10:01.082]  So is this, you think, them saying, we're watching you, we are listening to you, and we want you to know that, or what's your interpretation of it?
[03:10:01.082 --> 03:10:02.803]  That's my interpretation.
[03:10:02.803 --> 03:10:04.604]  But my friend, I told him,
[03:10:05.616 --> 03:10:06.977]  I don't know.
[03:10:26.850 --> 03:10:27.550]  Oh, okay.
[03:10:27.550 --> 03:10:31.252]  Well, wear your boonie there, Roger, and don't let them get a face shot of you.
[03:10:31.252 --> 03:10:34.193]  But I would advise you to get yourself a high-powered camera.
[03:10:34.193 --> 03:10:35.434]  Get some shots of them.
[03:10:35.434 --> 03:10:43.417]  If you hold the camera in front of your face and they can't get a clear picture of your face, get some photos of them and send them here to InfoWars.
[03:10:43.417 --> 03:10:51.500]  Well, I'm going to try to, if I could figure out how to do this, download those pictures from his phone onto my computer and send it to you guys.
[03:10:51.500 --> 03:10:54.041]  But I just want everybody to know is,
[03:10:54.896 --> 03:10:56.157]  Uh, and you too.
[03:10:56.157 --> 03:10:57.718]  They're listening to this show.
[03:10:57.718 --> 03:10:59.179]  Oh, and of course they are.
[03:10:59.179 --> 03:11:01.341]  Yeah, of course they are.
[03:11:01.341 --> 03:11:06.225]  They knew I was the one that called in and they wanted to come back and say, hey, you're not getting away with anything.
[03:11:06.225 --> 03:11:08.787]  Well, Roger, this goes for you and everybody else out there.
[03:11:08.787 --> 03:11:14.731]  We need more people with cameras and video cameras and high powered cameras, not just the iPhone, cell phone cameras.
[03:11:14.731 --> 03:11:16.532]  Those aren't really high resolution.
[03:11:16.532 --> 03:11:22.277]  Folks, get more cameras going and you can get more proof and more footage that
[03:11:22.637 --> 03:11:26.959]  InfoWars will share and air, and that's crucial for all of us to remember.
[03:11:26.959 --> 03:11:35.061]  You know, photographic evidence is one of the ways that we can really defend ourselves against this kind of what sounds like an intimidation tactic.
[03:11:35.061 --> 03:11:36.402]  And, Roger, I appreciate your call.
[03:11:36.402 --> 03:11:38.002]  It's great to get an update from you.
[03:11:38.002 --> 03:11:40.083]  I want to go to Zachary in California.
[03:11:40.083 --> 03:11:41.784]  He's been on hold for a while.
[03:11:41.784 --> 03:11:43.484]  Zachary, how are you today, sir?
[03:11:43.484 --> 03:11:44.705]  How can I help you?
[03:11:44.705 --> 03:11:45.285]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:11:45.285 --> 03:11:45.765]  Can you hear me?
[03:11:45.765 --> 03:11:46.385]  Am I clear?
[03:11:46.385 --> 03:11:47.065]  Yeah, it's clear.
[03:11:47.065 --> 03:11:48.066]  Go ahead.
[03:11:48.066 --> 03:11:48.366]  All right.
[03:11:48.366 --> 03:11:51.307]  Hey, by the way, my girlfriend and I went to Vilcabamba
[03:11:52.029 --> 03:11:59.811]  And, uh, but you had already left Texas, but yeah, everyone's talking about you down there in Ecuador.
[03:11:59.811 --> 03:12:02.132]  So, I want to make it real quick, though, for another caller.
[03:12:02.132 --> 03:12:10.735]  I don't know if there's another caller after me, but there's a, uh, were you on the phone, were you there with Alex when you guys were talking about the Secret Space Program?
[03:12:10.735 --> 03:12:12.115]  Uh, no, I was not here in studio, no.
[03:12:12.858 --> 03:12:22.321]  Okay, well he, Alex even had his dad come in and he had him talk about being in Montana and seeing things up in the sky like satellites but things that would go 90 degree angles.
[03:12:22.321 --> 03:12:26.902]  Some guy called in and said he worked at Area 52 and he was talking about Star Trek type technology.
[03:12:26.902 --> 03:12:31.104]  Anyway, I think Alex needs to have a whole show on the Secret Space Program.
[03:12:31.104 --> 03:12:36.365]  Anyway, there's something called Project Camelot and they have a lot of whistleblowers that come out and we actually saw them down there in Ecuador.
[03:12:36.365 --> 03:12:37.165]  They had a conference.
[03:12:37.165 --> 03:12:40.827]  Anyway, Project Camelot has these whistleblowers come out and it's very important information.
[03:12:40.827 --> 03:12:42.107]  I think the listeners are going to love this stuff.
[03:12:42.543 --> 03:12:49.105]  Like, there are moon and Mars colonies with 500,000 people on them on the Mars... Well, James, I... Yeah, I hear you, James.
[03:12:49.105 --> 03:13:02.408]  I just, you know, Alex normally doesn't focus on what he calls little green men type of stories, although I know he did cover the space plane technology and some secret military technology that's out there.
[03:13:02.408 --> 03:13:05.069]  It's just, you know, obviously that's his choice of what he wants to cover.
[03:13:05.069 --> 03:13:09.370]  I'm just telling you up front, he normally likes to focus on more Earth.
[03:13:10.270 --> 03:13:10.971]  Am I back on?
[03:13:10.971 --> 03:13:12.712]  Yeah, you're on.
[03:13:12.712 --> 03:13:15.354]  Okay, well I just have a little card here.
[03:13:15.354 --> 03:13:17.015]  Can I please just say these things?
[03:13:17.015 --> 03:13:19.457]  Okay, we were on the ground and we get these military night vision.
[03:13:19.457 --> 03:13:24.201]  I go out with Ed Grimsley, he's been on Coast to Coast, and we see these things up in the air.
[03:13:24.201 --> 03:13:26.143]  Now this is very important.
[03:13:26.143 --> 03:13:27.124]  This is the most important issue that we have.
[03:13:40.174 --> 03:13:40.934]  Yeah, yeah, he covered CERN.
[03:14:08.070 --> 03:14:11.251]  And the ETs are responsible for the eugenics, the abductions, the whole grey thing.
[03:14:11.251 --> 03:14:15.433]  Now the whole grey man thing, you can make fun of it all you want, but this is the most important issue we have.
[03:14:15.433 --> 03:14:16.813]  The Anunnaki and the Nephilim.
[03:14:16.813 --> 03:14:18.014]  I hear you Zachary.
[03:14:18.014 --> 03:14:19.575]  I hear you man.
[03:14:19.575 --> 03:14:21.875]  I'm really, I'm glad you're sharing this information.
[03:14:21.875 --> 03:14:26.417]  I just, some of this, you gotta get some footage and send in the footage.
[03:14:26.417 --> 03:14:27.978]  I mean, some of it is...
[03:14:28.698 --> 03:14:38.561]  It's very difficult for people to latch on to unless there's more photographic evidence or leaked papers from ex-military files and things like that.
[03:14:38.561 --> 03:14:42.943]  So if you can get some of that stuff, I know the InfoWars producers will take a look at that.
[03:14:42.943 --> 03:14:44.924]  I appreciate your call, Zachary.
[03:14:44.924 --> 03:14:45.804]  Thanks for calling in.
[03:14:45.804 --> 03:14:49.345]  Let's go to, wow, the caller screen is blank here.
[03:14:49.345 --> 03:14:52.466]  Let's go to the next caller who's holding, I believe, from Michigan, if I remember correctly.
[03:14:52.466 --> 03:14:56.147]  Hey, how you doing today, Mike?
[03:14:56.147 --> 03:14:57.128]  Yeah, James, is that your name?
[03:14:57.881 --> 03:15:00.522]  Yes sir.
[03:15:00.522 --> 03:15:04.323]  Yeah, I got a couple things I want to say real fast.
[03:15:04.323 --> 03:15:11.324]  I have family out in Farwell, Michigan, and they're sending their daughter to kindergarten.
[03:15:11.324 --> 03:15:19.246]  And they're forcing their daughter to learn the Chinese language in their school or she won't pass the kindergarten.
[03:15:19.246 --> 03:15:21.146]  Then there's another thing.
[03:15:21.146 --> 03:15:27.528]  I was outside and a sheriff pulled up and started to talk to us.
[03:15:28.480 --> 03:15:31.145]  And he started asking for IDs and stuff.
[03:15:31.145 --> 03:15:38.418]  And he- I brought up the Constitution about our constitutional right, and he threatened to arrest me, started bullying me, thinking I'm gonna kiss his boots.
[03:15:39.347 --> 03:15:41.768]  And it's just all this bad things going on.
[03:15:41.768 --> 03:15:43.349]  It's just it's getting ridiculous.
[03:15:43.349 --> 03:15:52.714]  Well, listen up, you know, in this slave nation police state, you're not allowed to invoke the Constitution anymore, especially not in a court, a courtroom scenario.
[03:15:52.714 --> 03:15:55.676]  So he's probably a little ticked off that you think you have rights.
[03:15:55.676 --> 03:16:01.499]  How dare you think you have rights now about about learning Chinese in kindergarten?
[03:16:02.419 --> 03:16:05.442]  First of all, I don't know how much Chinese a kindergartner can even learn.
[03:16:05.442 --> 03:16:12.507]  I mean, it took me years to speak some of that language as an adult, and I'm still not totally fluent in it.
[03:16:12.507 --> 03:16:23.016]  But, you know, Chinese is obviously a useful language to know in terms of what's happening with our world, but I agree with you that no one should be forced
[03:16:23.596 --> 03:16:25.937]  I can't believe how our sheriffs are trying to
[03:16:39.924 --> 03:16:42.865]  Be bullies to us because we're bringing up the Constitution.
[03:16:42.865 --> 03:16:45.086]  They're sworn to protect the Constitution.
[03:16:45.086 --> 03:16:51.267]  You know, most of the time sheriffs are actually, you know, like Sheriff Mack who's been on this show.
[03:16:51.267 --> 03:16:55.028]  Sheriffs, by and large, tend to be the good guys.
[03:16:55.028 --> 03:17:00.630]  So you must have run into a bad apple out there who just is on a power trip or an ego trip or something like that, James.
[03:17:01.923 --> 03:17:02.644]  Yeah, you're right.
[03:17:02.644 --> 03:17:08.070]  That's what he was, too, because he called backup and got out of his car and got all loud with me and threatened to arrest me.
[03:17:08.070 --> 03:17:10.993]  It's just getting terrible nowadays.
[03:17:10.993 --> 03:17:12.174]  Yeah, well, you're right on.
[03:17:12.174 --> 03:17:13.035]  I appreciate your call.
[03:17:13.035 --> 03:17:14.196]  Thanks for sharing that with us.
[03:17:14.196 --> 03:17:21.745]  And folks, remember, do firmly stand up for your rights, but don't escalate situations with sheriffs or even police because they are trained
[03:17:22.265 --> 03:17:26.888]  to fight escalation with more violence on their side.
[03:17:26.888 --> 03:17:37.414]  So stay calm, stay chill, state your rights, know your rights, and stand firm in your belief that you are protected by the Bill of Rights, and you'll have more leverage in those kinds of encounters.
[03:17:37.414 --> 03:17:38.855]  But thanks for your call.
[03:17:38.855 --> 03:17:46.160]  Now, Richard in Indiana, just thanks for joining us, but I want to warn you, we're about to go to a break, but very quickly, Richard, what's on your mind and how can we help you?
[03:17:46.724 --> 03:17:47.765]  Hi Mike, it's a pleasure.
[03:17:47.765 --> 03:17:54.988]  I wanted to ask what you mentioned earlier in the broadcast about forced inoculations, and I believe that too will come to pass.
[03:17:54.988 --> 03:18:11.296]  When that happens, how do you think this will play out when people such as myself that's on retirement, and it goes as far as shutting your Social Security check off your bank down, how do you think it'll play out when there's millions of us who are informed and will say no?
[03:18:11.296 --> 03:18:12.937]  Where do you think this will go?
[03:18:14.667 --> 03:18:16.328]  Well, that's a really good question, Richard.
[03:18:16.328 --> 03:18:21.712]  I was actually pondering that as I drove here today to be on the show.
[03:18:21.712 --> 03:18:25.314]  And the first thing I realized is you have to be able to track people.
[03:18:25.314 --> 03:18:28.136]  So, they have to have a tracking technology in place.
[03:18:28.136 --> 03:18:39.224]  Now, whether that's an RFID chip, which they're calling now electronic tattoos, or whether that is a vaccine bracelet, or some kind of paperwork that you have to carry around, I'm not sure yet.
[03:18:39.964 --> 03:18:41.205]  But that's step one.
[03:18:41.205 --> 03:18:43.085]  So they got to have a vaccine tracking technology.
[03:18:43.085 --> 03:18:46.827]  I think I think that's where some of the military defense contractors are coming into play.
[03:18:46.827 --> 03:18:50.228]  But then secondly, you got to look at the quarantines.
[03:18:50.228 --> 03:19:03.093]  If they mandate vaccines, those who refuse to be vaccinated are very likely to be quarantined, which means perhaps the CDC would be leasing camps or facilities like FEMA camps from FEMA.
[03:19:03.093 --> 03:19:03.553]  Just just
[03:19:04.173 --> 03:19:05.313]  As an example.
[03:19:05.313 --> 03:19:11.915]  And then making those quarantine camps where they throw you in with all the other people who have refused the vaccines.
[03:19:11.915 --> 03:19:13.776]  I mean, what do you think about that scenario?
[03:19:13.776 --> 03:19:16.997]  Does that sound like a reasonable way this might play out?
[03:19:16.997 --> 03:19:20.118]  Yeah, and I wondered about that becoming reality.
[03:19:20.118 --> 03:19:22.558]  Would there be house-to-house searches?
[03:19:22.558 --> 03:19:27.000]  And if you said no and you're a doorway, give me liberty or give me death.
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:27.980]  What do you think would happen?
[03:19:28.868 --> 03:19:34.413]  Well, I think they would just shoot you, frankly, because that's what they've been doing increasingly now.
[03:19:34.413 --> 03:19:36.694]  Very violent government raids, armed raids.
[03:19:36.694 --> 03:19:39.797]  I think they would become quite violent.
[03:19:39.797 --> 03:19:43.680]  Richard, I want to continue with you on the other side of this break, if you'll stay on hold with us.
[03:19:43.680 --> 03:19:46.642]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, the Overdrive segment.
[03:19:46.642 --> 03:19:50.446]  I'm your host here, fill-in host Mike Adams, and stay with us right after this break.
[03:19:50.446 --> 03:19:52.087]  We'll continue with this conversation.
[03:20:01.718 --> 03:20:07.565]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[03:20:07.565 --> 03:20:10.768]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.
[03:20:10.768 --> 03:20:22.081]  We promote premium quality health, energy, and skincare products using dynamic, caring personalities and state-of-the-art media technology to spread a powerful message of health.
[03:20:22.401 --> 03:20:24.683]  Wealth, longevity, and freedom.
[03:20:24.683 --> 03:20:32.188]  This low-cost business opportunity is designed for full-time or part-time so you can work as little or as much as you'd like.
[03:20:32.188 --> 03:20:34.589]  It is you that defines the reward level.
[03:20:34.589 --> 03:20:41.754]  Whether you are seeking a few hundred extra dollars per month or a six or even seven figure annual income, it's up to you.
[03:20:41.754 --> 03:20:42.795]  Want to find out more?
[03:20:42.795 --> 03:20:49.439]  Shoot an email with InfoWars Team in the subject line to InfoWars Team Coordinator, MZ, and tell him a little bit about yourself.
[03:20:49.439 --> 03:20:51.861]  That's the initials MZ at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[03:20:52.321 --> 03:20:54.804]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[03:20:54.804 --> 03:20:57.106]  I only promote products that I truly believe in.
[03:20:57.106 --> 03:20:58.568]  And these are phenomenal.
[03:20:58.568 --> 03:21:01.071]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[03:21:02.768 --> 03:21:07.451]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[03:21:07.451 --> 03:21:13.895]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[03:21:13.895 --> 03:21:16.157]  Number one, study the past.
[03:21:16.157 --> 03:21:18.558]  History really does repeat itself.
[03:21:18.558 --> 03:21:22.281]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[03:21:23.416 --> 03:21:26.500]  Number three, take decisive action.
[03:21:26.500 --> 03:21:30.344]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[03:21:30.344 --> 03:21:35.390]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[03:21:35.390 --> 03:21:38.815]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[03:21:39.375 --> 03:21:42.797]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[03:21:42.797 --> 03:21:47.299]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[03:21:47.299 --> 03:21:52.222]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[03:21:52.222 --> 03:21:56.844]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[03:21:56.844 --> 03:21:59.026]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[03:22:01.718 --> 03:22:02.739]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:22:02.739 --> 03:22:08.283]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:22:08.283 --> 03:22:08.823]  I get it.
[03:22:08.823 --> 03:22:18.451]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:22:18.451 --> 03:22:19.852]  That's not what's happening.
[03:22:19.852 --> 03:22:28.338]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:22:28.338 --> 03:22:31.581]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:22:31.701 --> 03:22:35.963]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:22:35.963 --> 03:22:37.584]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:22:37.584 --> 03:22:40.985]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:22:40.985 --> 03:22:45.347]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:22:45.347 --> 03:22:46.247]  You should, too.
[03:22:46.247 --> 03:22:47.408]  Find out what they know.
[03:22:47.408 --> 03:22:50.709]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:22:50.709 --> 03:22:50.769]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:50.769 --> 03:22:51.089]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.089 --> 03:22:51.289]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.936 --> 03:23:05.002]  For centuries, silver has been used as a powerful natural antibiotic.
[03:23:05.002 --> 03:23:10.169]  And as a listener to this station, you probably already know the benefits of using colloidal silver.
[03:23:10.169 --> 03:23:17.459]  With so many websites to choose from, finding a reputable patriotic company with great products at affordable prices can be a difficult task.

[03:23:57.328 --> 03:24:00.370]  Taking back America's healthcare, one American at a time.
[03:24:00.370 --> 03:24:08.138]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[03:24:08.138 --> 03:24:10.520]  There was something so pleasant about it.
[03:24:13.160 --> 03:24:14.540]  Alright, welcome back, folks.
[03:24:14.540 --> 03:24:15.861]  Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:15.861 --> 03:24:20.662]  Mike Adams here filling in on this Overdrive segment.
[03:24:20.662 --> 03:24:23.702]  We have a caller, Richard from Indiana, that we're going to go to in just a second.
[03:24:23.702 --> 03:24:29.104]  He asked about what's going to happen if they have a mandatory vaccination policy?
[03:24:29.104 --> 03:24:30.024]  How's that going to play out?
[03:24:30.024 --> 03:24:32.364]  I think that's a really important question.
[03:24:32.364 --> 03:24:38.426]  Now, if you recall, the Institute of Medicine that we talked about with Alex here on the air before the Overdrive section here,
[03:24:39.426 --> 03:24:53.279]  The Institute of Medicine will undoubtedly be cited as the authority claiming that vaccines are perfectly safe and therefore mandatory vaccination policies are good for the nation.
[03:24:53.279 --> 03:24:54.781]  So watch for that.
[03:24:54.781 --> 03:24:58.944]  In the next disease outbreak, which I think could be coming as early as this fall,
[03:24:59.665 --> 03:25:07.568]  The government will say, well, mandatory vaccines, no problem, because the Institute of Medicine said there are basically very few side effects.
[03:25:07.568 --> 03:25:08.689]  Watch for that.
[03:25:08.689 --> 03:25:10.089]  Now, Richard, let's go back to you.
[03:25:10.089 --> 03:25:11.630]  Are you still on the phone with us?
[03:25:11.630 --> 03:25:12.010]  Yes.
[03:25:12.010 --> 03:25:15.192]  One more quick question, and then I'll let you get on to other callers.
[03:25:15.192 --> 03:25:24.976]  What could we do, those of us who are informed, who are the resistance, to help avert even getting to the doorstep of forced vaccinations?
[03:25:24.976 --> 03:25:27.457]  Obviously, writing our congressional members doesn't do much.
[03:25:28.146 --> 03:25:33.912]  Is there anything else you could tell us what we could do to help stop this before it gets to that point?
[03:25:34.875 --> 03:25:36.816]  Well, I think what you're doing right now is a great example of it.
[03:25:36.816 --> 03:25:38.437]  You're calling in here to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:25:38.437 --> 03:25:43.360]  I think we need to get to activism at the grassroots level.
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:47.082]  You need to share the stories that are published on InfoWars.com.
[03:25:47.082 --> 03:25:49.584]  You need to tell people about what's going on.
[03:25:49.584 --> 03:25:58.990]  I think the more people are aware of the real dangers of vaccines, the more difficult it's going to be for government to put a mandatory vaccination policy on us.
[03:25:59.710 --> 03:26:09.178]  And if you remember during the H5N1 scare, many of the nurses and hospital workers in New York and Boston and other areas resisted that.
[03:26:09.178 --> 03:26:16.024]  I mean, they protested right there on the streets and were adamantly against forced vaccination.
[03:26:16.024 --> 03:26:17.225]  So that's a good sign.
[03:26:17.225 --> 03:26:21.468]  But it means that the feds are going to have to create a very large
[03:26:22.489 --> 03:26:28.495]  Infectious disease false flag type of event to convince people to take vaccines.
[03:26:28.495 --> 03:26:36.602]  That's why I'm thinking I'm thinking theoretically one of the possible scenarios is a government induced outbreak of infectious disease.
[03:26:37.483 --> 03:26:38.203]  God bless you sir.
[03:26:38.203 --> 03:26:39.184]  I guess first,
[03:26:59.619 --> 03:27:00.179]  Can you hear me okay?
[03:27:00.179 --> 03:27:02.720]  I just brought the microphone from my iPhone up.
[03:27:02.720 --> 03:27:04.320]  Yeah, I can hear you, Mark.
[03:27:04.320 --> 03:27:09.001]  My YouTube ID is RadDisciple.
[03:27:09.001 --> 03:27:11.301]  It's like Radical and Disciple crunched together.
[03:27:11.301 --> 03:27:18.603]  I just went to a town hall... I can't quite hear you there, Mark.
[03:27:18.603 --> 03:27:19.623]  It's cutting the internet.
[03:27:19.623 --> 03:27:20.223]  I apologize.
[03:27:20.223 --> 03:27:25.485]  We gotta go to John in Texas.
[03:27:25.485 --> 03:27:26.265]  Hi, Mike.
[03:27:26.265 --> 03:27:26.745]  Hello, John.
[03:27:26.745 --> 03:27:27.185]  You're on the air.
[03:27:27.185 --> 03:27:27.445]  Go ahead.
[03:27:27.987 --> 03:27:30.628]  Hey, first of all, I'd like to thank you for all the work you do.
[03:27:30.628 --> 03:27:32.949]  I've been following your work for quite some time.
[03:27:32.949 --> 03:27:39.631]  In fact, I start off my day every morning updating my files by going to your emails.
[03:27:39.631 --> 03:27:47.114]  And I'd like to point out that the whole concept of infection is really an illusion.
[03:27:47.114 --> 03:27:50.935]  And that vaccines and even viruses are really scams.
[03:27:50.935 --> 03:27:56.757]  And what I'd like to propose for you and everyone else who's trying to wake everyone else up about the vaccines is to consider the possibility
[03:27:57.651 --> 03:28:01.212]  That a virus is not what we've been led to believe.
[03:28:01.212 --> 03:28:11.696]  And when we try to warn other people, and we keep warning people about the viruses, we're actually perpetuating the myth that there is an infection.
[03:28:11.696 --> 03:28:14.037]  One of my students worked with you.
[03:28:14.037 --> 03:28:17.138]  You guys did a six-hour audio tape.
[03:28:17.138 --> 03:28:17.879]  His name is David.
[03:28:17.879 --> 03:28:18.659]  I won't say anything else.
[03:28:18.659 --> 03:28:19.839]  I don't want to plug anything.
[03:28:19.839 --> 03:28:20.780]  Alright.
[03:28:20.780 --> 03:28:21.460]  You probably know who he is.
[03:28:21.460 --> 03:28:22.760]  Yeah, I know who you're talking about.
[03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:23.341]  Yeah, great guy.
[03:28:23.341 --> 03:28:25.441]  He confessed to me after we worked for two years.
[03:28:25.441 --> 03:28:27.002]  He said, John, you know, everything you told me
[03:28:27.521 --> 03:28:28.403]  I understood.
[03:28:28.403 --> 03:28:29.204]  You saved my life.
[03:28:29.204 --> 03:28:30.726]  I was dying.
[03:28:30.726 --> 03:28:36.836]  And I know everything you're telling me is true, but the virus concept was something that I couldn't wrap my brain around.
[03:28:36.836 --> 03:28:40.702]  It took me two years before I finally could understand what you were trying to tell me.
[03:28:42.922 --> 03:28:46.924]  And I'd love to send you some information if you're interested on this to find out more about it.
[03:28:46.924 --> 03:28:54.148]  Well, let me, for those who are listening, and it might be, you know, this is sort of new information for a lot of people, but I know exactly where you're coming from.
[03:28:54.148 --> 03:29:06.375]  In modern medical science, there is a reductionistic point of view where everything has to be a physical object, and they say that these, a drug has to interlock like a key in a lock
[03:29:06.855 --> 03:29:13.500]  With a molecule has to fit like a physical, you know, tumbler system, and then that unlocks the molecule.
[03:29:13.500 --> 03:29:15.442]  I mean, you know that that's fiction.
[03:29:15.442 --> 03:29:17.123]  I know that that's fiction.
[03:29:17.123 --> 03:29:25.429]  But that is the terminology by which most people, even those in alternative health, currently talk about things today.
[03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:30.253]  And I'm sorry, John, we're out of time here in this Overdrive segment.
