[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:33.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.160 --> 00:38.200]  well a couple weeks ago I scheduled to take off from the radio on this 1010
[00:38.200 --> 00:43.920]  broadcast this Thursday edition so I could finish Obama deception to but then I
[00:43.920 --> 00:53.600]  decided to not take off today to work on Obama deception to so I am here live
[00:53.600 --> 00:59.120]  but only for the first 30 minutes and then I do have other duties that I need
[00:59.120 --> 01:03.680]  to take care of here in the info wars comm operations and David Knight will be
[01:03.680 --> 01:07.600]  here coming up at the bottom of the hour and he's got a big whistleblower guest
[01:07.600 --> 01:11.280]  from inside the banking cartels coming on we'll look at the persecution of
[01:11.280 --> 01:17.200]  whistleblowers that is accelerating and taking place that is coming up with
[01:17.200 --> 01:23.400]  David Knight at the bottom of the hour David Knight will also have another
[01:23.400 --> 01:27.320]  special guest joining him on the broadcast as well and we're going to
[01:27.320 --> 01:31.320]  premiere some special reports here today so it's going to be a jam-packed
[01:31.320 --> 01:37.800]  transmission obviously we're into day 10 or 11 of the government shutdown and
[01:37.800 --> 01:43.960]  things are getting very serious and now we're seeing members of Congress we're
[01:43.960 --> 01:47.920]  seeing New Republic magazine it's basically another arm of the White
[01:47.920 --> 01:52.360]  House so they speak for these establishment calling for basically
[01:52.360 --> 01:57.320]  martial law politically just do whatever they want we never even played that
[01:57.320 --> 02:03.320]  clip of the Texas Congresswoman talking about that yesterday but perhaps later
[02:03.320 --> 02:11.760]  in the broadcast we will play a clip of her the Houston Democrat breaking that
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.640]  down so that's the type of thing we're dealing with here and now dr. Paul Craig
[02:16.640 --> 02:21.280]  Roberts former head of policy at the Department of Treasury says Obama could
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.120]  use debt crisis to seize total power and bring in martial law with executive
[02:26.120 --> 02:31.280]  orders that's basically what Peter Schiff has been warning about as well so
[02:31.280 --> 02:41.400]  this is a very serious situation that we are dealing with here also we are going
[02:41.400 --> 02:50.760]  to be getting into the latest on the shutdown itself and the harassment of
[02:50.760 --> 02:54.560]  citizens that get anywhere near national parks they're now arresting people that
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.520]  show up not just pointing guns at them but arresting people that show up at the
[02:58.520 --> 03:02.960]  Grand Canyon Julie Wilson I wrote about that last night for info wars calm it's
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.440]  gotten almost no other coverage that I've seen pretty shocking also no one has
[03:08.440 --> 03:11.520]  been able to sign up for Obamacare through the exchanges except for one lady
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.920]  who spent multiple hours every day working with CNN to try to sign up and
[03:16.920 --> 03:22.120]  then her her deductible was $13,000 and it was double I have the article here
[03:22.120 --> 03:28.720]  double the cost that was previous and still the Obama supporters are thankful
[03:28.720 --> 03:33.320]  saying now I'll be able to get health care when it's going to wreck the already
[03:33.320 --> 03:37.160]  screwed up system because of special interest being involved the last five
[03:37.160 --> 03:42.160]  decades so we're going to be breaking all of that down as well but when we come
[03:42.160 --> 03:51.520]  back from break I want to sum up for you the essence of what Obamacare really
[03:51.520 --> 03:58.560]  is and why it's not meant to actually work why it's not meant to actually
[03:58.560 --> 04:02.240]  operate and then we'll go over some of the other headlines that are up on info
[04:02.240 --> 04:08.120]  wars calm and prison planet calm but there's a report out by red state and
[04:08.120 --> 04:10.840]  other big sites we don't know if it's accurate but these are from pretty
[04:10.840 --> 04:15.840]  credible sites and by credible they usually report real news feds order
[04:15.840 --> 04:21.560]  National Guard to close I-495 derail trucker protest well I mean that would do
[04:21.560 --> 04:25.920]  what the protest was supposed to do to begin with shut things down so Obama
[04:25.920 --> 04:35.360]  supporter arrested after aiming gun at female impeachment protesters so that
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.320]  we've got that big article up on info wars calm X Treasury official Obama could
[04:39.320 --> 04:43.720]  use debt crisis disease total control just mentioned that is Obama going to be
[04:43.720 --> 04:48.520]  our new Caesar dr. Paul Craig Roberts asked in that article warning and
[04:48.520 --> 04:52.920]  rolling and Obamacare allows government to link your IP with your name and of
[04:52.920 --> 04:56.200]  course Mike Adams as usual has figured out what it's really all about we're
[04:56.200 --> 05:01.720]  gonna be breaking that down the other side as well stay with us Ben Swan here

[08:45.920 --> 08:50.840]  armed open carry March in San Antonio out front the Alamo the police chief has
[08:50.840 --> 08:55.920]  said he will arrest anyone legally carrying firearms this is how they
[08:55.920 --> 08:59.400]  harass people that have firearms in their garage and the neighbor sees it you
[08:59.400 --> 09:04.120]  go to jail because they claim that you're carrying a gun to alarm no it's
[09:04.120 --> 09:06.880]  legal to walk down the road with a hatchet if you're going to cut something
[09:06.880 --> 09:10.640]  but if you brandish the hatchet and say I'm gonna kill you with it that's what
[09:10.640 --> 09:15.480]  the law says brandishing a weapon well the Department of Defense has put out a
[09:15.480 --> 09:19.560]  report saying there's a growing trend of soldiers assigned to Fort Hood openly
[09:19.560 --> 09:22.800]  carrying firearms in private businesses establishments yeah when they're off
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.040]  duty and officers and live in their own house in establishments in the greater
[09:27.040 --> 09:30.600]  local area and attempt to publicly assert the Second Amendment rights these
[09:30.600 --> 09:34.640]  events have led to several confrontations with civilian law enforcement
[09:34.640 --> 09:37.520]  personnel tipping to determine whether there was any threat to the public
[09:37.520 --> 09:42.400]  safety Texas law makes it illegal to display a firearm in a public place in a
[09:42.400 --> 09:47.080]  manner calculated to alarm and that's how they arrest people every day
[09:47.080 --> 09:50.880]  nationwide we're putting a deer rifle on the back of their car to go shooting
[09:50.880 --> 09:54.840]  the neighbor doesn't like it you get swat teamed a lot of times killed this is
[09:54.840 --> 10:00.320]  their reign of terror against gun owners when legal gun owners frustrate crime
[10:00.320 --> 10:05.840]  49 times the new Justice Department numbers used to be 20 something 49 times
[10:05.840 --> 10:09.600]  for every time a gun is used in a commission of a crime look it up funny
[10:09.600 --> 10:17.880]  it's 49 times because it's also 49% in overall crimes using guns since 1992
[10:17.880 --> 10:22.080]  Justice Department numbers that's coming up bottom of the hour David Knight and
[10:22.080 --> 10:25.600]  he's got a bunch of other big special reports we interviewed the Texas Land
[10:25.600 --> 10:29.800]  Commissioner who's backing open carry marches on the Alamo in fact the word
[10:29.800 --> 10:33.800]  is he may be down there for it so that Jerry Patterson interview is coming up
[10:33.800 --> 10:36.960]  that they did down at the Capitol with him we're gonna premiere that here on
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.400]  the radio coming up today and a lot more there's also a big whistleblower
[10:41.400 --> 10:46.440]  coming up I wasn't gonna come in today I was gonna work on other things here
[10:46.440 --> 10:49.360]  around the office but I'm here because the news is just so important wild
[10:49.360 --> 10:56.960]  horses couldn't drag me away from the fight here and so I want to in a nutshell
[10:56.960 --> 11:04.280]  tell you from deep research and this will all now come out from deep research
[11:04.280 --> 11:12.640]  what Obamacare really is in a nutshell it is a giant tax and of course I've
[11:12.640 --> 11:16.280]  been telling you that for five years it's been law for three but implements
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.840]  this year the Supreme Court has said it's a tax it is a tax but it's a private
[11:20.840 --> 11:27.120]  levy a ransom to the IMF and World Bank and Federal Reserve all heads of the
[11:27.120 --> 11:31.960]  same mega six bank cartel that's waging war against all the other insurance
[11:31.960 --> 11:36.040]  companies and banks the free market your family national government state
[11:36.040 --> 11:41.880]  governments it is a total economic warfare system in their own words the
[11:41.880 --> 11:46.360]  goal is impoverish you take over your society bankrupt you shine you on the
[11:46.360 --> 11:50.400]  debts that are impossible to pay back wreck the country end of debt that's all
[11:50.400 --> 11:55.040]  fiat and so they get the world is financial conquering we all know that
[11:55.040 --> 12:02.480]  but Obamacare was written 10,000 plus pages of writers 3,000 page bill by the
[12:02.480 --> 12:06.440]  big 10 insurance companies on record predominantly controlled by the big six
[12:06.440 --> 12:10.080]  really it's the big five megabanks but they say six now it's about five is
[12:10.080 --> 12:16.400]  once merged these conglomerates and they want to have the NSA total spying
[12:16.400 --> 12:20.840]  legalized it does that spying on everyone getting all your personal data
[12:20.840 --> 12:24.240]  sharing it with whoever they want they want government running your health
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.920]  care to carry out eugenics and lower standard of care and they want to be
[12:27.920 --> 12:31.640]  able to double the prices at least and then give that money to the banks as
[12:31.640 --> 12:39.000]  a tax then the government wants to cut though and by not allowing the exchanges
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.240]  to work and Mike Adams was top programmer he said this two days ago
[12:43.240 --> 12:46.880]  scanning the system put a big article out at natural news.com we had an
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.360]  info wars.com it's now in the news today Washington Post top programmers are
[12:52.360 --> 12:58.040]  saying gee there's nothing there it's a facade boy they really screwed up no no
[12:58.040 --> 13:01.840]  no they didn't screw up just like with amber alert the whole sites there they
[13:01.840 --> 13:07.360]  just put a block up front they are wrecking the system on purpose and
[13:07.360 --> 13:13.240]  then all their constituents want to freebie even after they get their tax
[13:13.240 --> 13:18.600]  returns their tax refunds get confiscated even as the middle class has
[13:18.600 --> 13:22.240]  the garnishment out of their bank accounts that's what the law says they
[13:22.240 --> 13:28.560]  hired 17,000 agents to do it even as all that happens the gullible slaves will
[13:28.560 --> 13:34.800]  still say gimme gimme gimme Republicans did it and we'll go into the next phase
[13:34.800 --> 13:38.440]  of the major screw job and I've talked a lot about the Nigerian email scam
[13:38.440 --> 13:42.520]  it's been around since 1995 because everybody knows about it there's many
[13:42.520 --> 13:46.600]  scams that's a well-known one where you know they say we need $5,000 in Prince
[13:46.600 --> 13:52.920]  a booby we'll send you 10 15 million and then you give Prince a booby $5,000 he
[13:52.920 --> 13:56.440]  says well the prince needs 10,000 more now but you'll get to talk to on the
[13:56.440 --> 14:00.040]  phone to be able to wire the money out of the account you know his uncle has
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.400]  held him hostage and then the person goes oh I want my 10 or 15 million here's
[14:04.400 --> 14:10.240]  10,000 more and usually once they get you to give the first 5,000 in some cases
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.680]  they get a hundred 200 300 thou people sell their houses and why are the money
[14:14.680 --> 14:20.600]  the Nigerian it's a government-run scam they allow it and they make hundreds of
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.040]  millions a year still off of it on record because people can't believe
[14:24.040 --> 14:28.440]  they've been conned so they just keep sticking money in like a degenerate
[14:28.440 --> 14:34.440]  gambler at the casino mortgaging his house the deeper they get in the hole
[14:34.440 --> 14:38.960]  the more they're gonna get into it it's the lottery ticket mentality if you buy
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.680]  a water ticket for fun that's another issue but people really think this is
[14:42.680 --> 14:47.080]  gonna save my life it's false hope instead of inventing something or
[14:47.080 --> 14:51.320]  getting another job or becoming a criminal I mean it's better than being a
[14:51.320 --> 14:55.040]  sucker I just don't pray on innocent people pray on the system more and more
[14:55.040 --> 14:59.520]  I think Robin Hood's the way to go I just said it I'm sorry don't do criminal
[14:59.520 --> 15:03.480]  stuff myself but I mean in the world of criminals you got to survive as long as
[15:03.480 --> 15:06.800]  it's against the criminal enemy whatever the point is there's nothing
[15:06.800 --> 15:12.800]  stupider than being suckers and they're gonna take them all to the bank and
[15:12.800 --> 15:18.400]  they're now just like Sibelius said on Monday on John Stewart show she said
[15:18.400 --> 15:23.360]  well you know since it doesn't work we're just gonna find you $5,000 and
[15:23.360 --> 15:27.320]  that's always been the plan poor people are just not gonna get their refund
[15:27.320 --> 15:30.800]  you're not gonna get your 300 to a thousand dollars you just it's gone and
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.960]  then everybody else it doesn't matter they're going to find and feed you the
[15:34.960 --> 15:38.880]  way it's written if you don't get the type of insurance they want it's all
[15:38.880 --> 15:43.880]  over folks this is a American killing machine I already knew that but I'm
[15:43.880 --> 15:49.000]  surprised at how bold it is I've got to be honest with you I mean this is worse
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.200]  than I even thought it would be I mean we knew it was built to do this we had
[15:52.200 --> 15:56.360]  Dr. Blalock on medical doctor and others five years ago warning everybody how
[15:56.360 --> 16:00.600]  they did this in third world countries and Europe but they're really doing it
[16:00.600 --> 16:06.320]  and only abject ignorance is allowing it and here's a Washington Post article we
[16:06.320 --> 16:11.880]  paid 634 million for this Obamacare site and all we got was a lousy 404 error
[16:11.880 --> 16:16.160]  well Mike Adams is scanned it and this article and others go over it it is
[16:16.160 --> 16:20.760]  completely fake and not meant to work it's because there is no site there do
[16:20.760 --> 16:26.600]  you understand it's all a big joke here's another one right here that Mike
[16:26.600 --> 16:30.840]  Adams breaks down info wars.com warning enrolling in Obamacare allows
[16:30.840 --> 16:35.480]  government to link your IP with your name just like the cash for clunkers when

[27:20.320 --> 27:24.720]  ties to Hitler's Nazi propaganda on and on and on just type in the Nazi origins
[27:24.720 --> 27:29.640]  of Olympic modern Olympics and you'll just get all of it for heaven's sakes

[27:53.400 --> 27:57.880]  are chemical engineers that they have doctorates and and and they will do it
[27:57.880 --> 28:03.320]  and and we said we want everyone to wear helmets to walk down the street keep
[28:03.320 --> 28:07.040]  everybody safe and they signed it 14 out of 20 they're already making people play
[28:07.040 --> 28:12.280]  you'll soccer have to wear helmets they're already shutting dodgeball down
[28:12.280 --> 28:15.640]  nationwide they're already saying you can't see mother and father or it's

[28:19.880 --> 28:22.720]  think you're on a power trip because you you feel like you're part of it
[28:22.720 --> 28:26.080]  you're not now David Knight you've got a big show in the next two and a half
[28:26.080 --> 28:29.480]  hours coming up today while I take care of things here at the office and also

[28:36.600 --> 28:39.640]  the things that's most frustrating is how every time you go back and draw
[28:39.640 --> 28:42.600]  parallels to what happened in Nazi Germany people just dismiss it as
[28:42.600 --> 28:45.920]  hyperbole it's not hyperbole it's understatement to look at what they're
[28:45.920 --> 28:49.880]  doing now it's far worse to call something Orwellian it's far worse in
[28:49.880 --> 28:53.240]  Georgia there are resting people that show up at the Grand Canyon absolutely
[28:53.240 --> 28:55.880]  it's crazy that's one of the most frustrating things about it and I
[28:55.880 --> 29:00.240]  would suggest that he go look at a book about Frank Olson called a terrible
[29:00.240 --> 29:05.520]  mistake these are declassified documents his family has been he was a research
[29:05.520 --> 29:09.680]  scientist sons been on they threw him out the top window at Fort Detrick and he
[29:09.680 --> 29:13.840]  was there when they were developing in the 1950s developing a lot of biological
[29:13.840 --> 29:17.360]  and chemical weapons with war criminals that they had brought over from Nazi
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.200]  Germany from Japan and you know of course they executed people for doing
[29:21.200 --> 29:25.960]  waterboarding in Japan but now we've got Cheney and Rumsfeld but all they've
[29:25.960 --> 29:29.640]  got to do is say laugh out loud exactly and then it's okay just just laugh at us
[29:29.640 --> 29:33.120]  and those of us done research we're dumb we're right wingers they're
[29:33.120 --> 29:37.920]  intellectual giants by laughing yeah if he reads that book it'll it'll be a real
[29:37.920 --> 29:42.520]  eye oh no he'll get he'll just laugh more he'll just say that the BBC isn't real

[33:01.680 --> 33:18.400]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[33:22.520 --> 33:25.560]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in the rest of the
[33:25.560 --> 33:30.600]  show for Alex now Alex mentioned in the first segment about this memo that was
[33:30.600 --> 33:36.000]  just sent to us anonymously from Fort Hood and he pointed out he read it at
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.120]  the first paragraph there where they were saying that there's a growing trend
[33:39.120 --> 33:43.000]  of soldiers who are signed to Fort Hood that are openly carrying firearms and
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.800]  private business establishments in the greater local area and attempt to
[33:45.800 --> 33:49.240]  publicly assert their Second Amendment rights this is really something that is
[33:49.240 --> 33:53.200]  being fired across the bow to try to intimidate people I believe from this
[33:53.200 --> 33:58.680]  rally that's coming up October the 19th at the Alamo very important rally if
[33:58.680 --> 34:01.920]  you're here in Texas you need to be there if you support the Second
[34:01.920 --> 34:05.280]  Amendment come and show your support if you're not in Texas you might even
[34:05.280 --> 34:11.040]  consider coming but that's a very very important demonstration that's going to
[34:11.040 --> 34:14.800]  be happening there and one of the things that we've seen remember it wasn't that
[34:14.800 --> 34:18.600]  long ago this is back in April this year remember the veteran Army Master
[34:18.600 --> 34:24.200]  Sergeant CJ Gresham and he was arrested he was just out hunting with his son and
[34:24.200 --> 34:29.040]  he had a rifle slung over his back and a cop harassed him and then eventually
[34:29.040 --> 34:33.240]  arrested him he had no idea it's a very interesting video if you watch it it's
[34:33.240 --> 34:38.520]  an amazing video and that was the excuse that the officer gave him he said in
[34:38.520 --> 34:42.560]  this day and age people are alarmed when they see someone with what you have in
[34:42.560 --> 34:47.640]  other words a gun he said and they don't care what the law is he kept asking the
[34:47.640 --> 34:52.160]  officer what law have I broken he said we don't care what the law is you've got
[34:52.160 --> 34:57.280]  a gun that alarms us that is they charge him with rudely displaying a firearm
[34:57.280 --> 35:01.360]  having it slung over your back is not threatening anybody as Alex pointed out
[35:01.360 --> 35:05.080]  that is not against the law the intention of the law was to say that
[35:05.080 --> 35:08.920]  you're not going to be waving a gun around pointing it at a crowd alarming
[35:08.920 --> 35:12.640]  people if you've got it responsibly carried slung over your arm you're
[35:12.640 --> 35:17.480]  allowed to do that under the law this is simply intimidation and this is what
[35:17.480 --> 35:22.200]  CJ Grisham said he said the easy wrong would have been to surrender my rights
[35:22.200 --> 35:26.320]  and to allow the cops to disarm me that's the easy wrong to me the hard
[35:26.320 --> 35:30.040]  rock the hard right is putting ourselves on the line knowing that
[35:30.040 --> 35:35.360]  something could happen and I got to say that's still true that's still true of
[35:35.360 --> 35:40.840]  all the people at Fort Hood who have taken an oath to the Constitution it's a
[35:40.840 --> 35:44.760]  hard right that you need to support it's hard to support your rights it's hard
[35:44.760 --> 35:48.800]  to stand for your rights but you need to do it you of all people we've seen with
[35:48.800 --> 35:53.120]  the shutdown how the things that we've been telling you for quite some time the
[35:53.120 --> 35:57.080]  documents that we've released showing that it's patriots people who support
[35:57.080 --> 36:00.840]  the Constitution people are looking for a better way of life people who support
[36:00.840 --> 36:06.200]  the right to keep and bear arms veterans especially are the enemies of Obama and
[36:06.200 --> 36:10.840]  the department it's not just a Obama this went back to the Patriot Act this
[36:10.840 --> 36:15.480]  goes back to the Bush administration this is a bipartisan thing it's just every
[36:15.480 --> 36:19.680]  administration it gets more obvious it gets more direct it gets more in your
[36:19.680 --> 36:23.880]  face with every successive administration it doesn't really matter who it is you
[36:23.880 --> 36:26.800]  can go back and look at health care do you think it would have been any different
[36:26.800 --> 36:31.960]  if we'd had Senator McCain as president McCain or if we'd had Romney as
[36:31.960 --> 36:37.320]  president Romney no Romney wrote Obamacare with Ted Kennedy they said they
[36:37.320 --> 36:40.840]  based it on it it's very very very similar there's no difference whatsoever
[36:40.840 --> 36:44.560]  and you can see what McCain is doing McCain is saying hey Obama was elected
[36:44.560 --> 36:49.240]  obey him well you know what a lot of people who didn't want Obamacare a lot
[36:49.240 --> 36:54.440]  of people who were upset about the bank bailouts were the core of the Tea Party
[36:54.440 --> 36:59.240]  Movement that's what they came together about it was about the Tea Party was
[36:59.240 --> 37:03.160]  about bank bailouts it was about corporatism and they were the ones who
[37:03.160 --> 37:06.880]  elected these members to Congress about Obamacare that's why most of these
[37:06.880 --> 37:11.080]  members of Congress are there they need to stand there and oppose this that's
[37:11.080 --> 37:16.200]  why we have checks and balances that's why we don't have a Caesar in government
[37:16.200 --> 37:20.560]  we have a president who is subject to the checks and balances of the House the
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.880]  Senate and many other places the states actually with the 10th amendment but
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.520]  we've got a interview that Jakari Jackson did with a patriot candidate for
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.400]  land commissioner Jerry Patterson and I want you to hear this especially in
[37:34.400 --> 37:39.040]  light of what we've just seen come out of Fort Hood I'm here with Jerry Patterson
[37:39.040 --> 37:42.120]  the next lieutenant governor how are you doing mr. Patterson I'm doing really
[37:42.120 --> 37:45.840]  well so can you just explain to us the position of lieutenant governor and what
[37:45.840 --> 37:50.480]  you hope to achieve now the lieutenant governor is arguably the most powerful
[37:50.480 --> 37:55.320]  position in Texas government and I'm not seeking power but I frankly think
[37:55.320 --> 38:00.160]  that we are on the cusp of going the wrong direction in Texas and we need
[38:00.160 --> 38:04.520]  somebody who is not afraid somebody who's straight and I mean straight in the
[38:04.520 --> 38:10.120]  sense that I tell you what I think and somebody who has specific things that he
[38:10.120 --> 38:14.080]  or she in this case he wishes to accomplish and if you go to my website
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.320]  boatpatterson.com unlike all the other candidates you're going to see a very
[38:18.320 --> 38:22.640]  detailed enumeration of things having to do with the second amendment and I
[38:22.640 --> 38:27.760]  encourage folks to go and read what I say about that water transportation
[38:27.760 --> 38:33.480]  education immigration so I think folks are looking for leadership and I think
[38:33.480 --> 38:40.480]  we have too many candidates who are more interested in looking good and who are
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.920]  more interested in the next election than the next generation and I'm only
[38:44.920 --> 38:49.000]  focused on doing what I think is right like some politicians and some office
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.840]  holders from the past in Texas we have too few of them today recently we saw
[38:53.840 --> 38:57.880]  the issues with the people at the Texas Capitol building and the people out
[38:57.880 --> 39:00.920]  there carrying the black powder pistols and it's my understanding that you
[39:00.920 --> 39:06.240]  actually wrote that law the definitions in chapter 4601 definitions in this
[39:06.240 --> 39:11.880]  chapter firearm does not include antique or curio firearm manufactured before
[39:11.880 --> 39:19.600]  1899 or a replica of an antique or curio firearm manufactured before 1899 but
[39:19.600 --> 39:24.240]  only if the replica does not use rimfire centerfire ammunition and mine is a
[39:24.240 --> 39:30.000]  ball in cap I was the author of the Texas concealed handgun law in 1995 and
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.200]  one of the items of unfinished business was I wanted to make these cap and ball
[39:34.200 --> 39:39.280]  replica revolvers not firearms under the law so after I left the legislature I
[39:39.280 --> 39:43.680]  wrote this statute I gave it to a state rep and a state senator they passed it
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.680]  testified in favor of it so I know the law very well and a cap and ball
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.880]  revolver that does not shoot centerfire rimfire ammunition under the law is not
[39:53.880 --> 39:57.800]  a firearm and that's under state and federal law so they had no firearm and
[39:57.800 --> 40:04.120]  their arrest was unlawful the law says you have to carry this firearm in a
[40:04.120 --> 40:10.560]  manner calculated to alarm now carrying a pistol in a holster is not calculated
[40:10.560 --> 40:15.720]  to alarm and think about the interesting testimony that's going to be I guess at
[40:15.720 --> 40:19.560]  trial when at the same time though we're arresting this guy for carrying an
[40:19.560 --> 40:24.840]  antique replica pistol that under the law is not a firearm at the same time
[40:24.840 --> 40:31.040]  right there were citizens lawfully carrying AR's and AK's sling arms and
[40:31.040 --> 40:36.440]  they weren't arrested so to the average bystander walking around assuming that
[40:36.440 --> 40:40.960]  anybody was alarmed and frankly they should not be why would you arrest a
[40:40.960 --> 40:45.080]  guy with an antique pistol that's not even a firearm under federal estate law
[40:45.080 --> 40:50.040]  but then it's okay with the AK's and the AR's it should be okay with AK's and
[40:50.040 --> 40:54.960]  AR's that is the law in Texas open carry of a long gun is not unlawful in
[40:54.960 --> 41:00.840]  Texas and so what we have here is somebody and I don't know I doubt that
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.880]  it was the the DPS officer but somebody decided to make up law and say I'm
[41:05.880 --> 41:11.000]  alarmed you know you have to have a reasonable standard to this you can't
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.400]  just say I'm alarmed I mean there are people who are easily alarmed they
[41:15.400 --> 41:19.000]  don't make law either somebody has to have a reasonable a standard these
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.760]  gentlemen were arrested unlawfully they broke no law and I'm anxious to see how
[41:24.760 --> 41:28.360]  this turns out at trial now one thing I'm anxious to see is this rally we have
[41:28.360 --> 41:31.760]  coming up on October 19th where people are going to gather at the Alamo
[41:31.760 --> 41:35.040]  carrying their long guns slung over their shoulders some people may have
[41:35.040 --> 41:38.400]  loaded firearms there's several different groups in my view they ought to kind of
[41:38.400 --> 41:42.000]  get together and just pick one person to be in charge of all this because the
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.640]  San Antonio PD has not been a friend of the Second Amendment this isn't about
[41:47.640 --> 41:51.720]  violating people's rights it's not about gun and control it's not about
[41:51.720 --> 41:57.600]  politics it's about the state law if the firearm is carried in a manner
[41:57.600 --> 42:02.280]  calculated to cause a law they consistently repetitively even going
[42:02.280 --> 42:07.320]  back 20 years when I carried the concealed handgun law a San Antonio PD was
[42:07.320 --> 42:11.200]  opposed to it now there were other police officers and police chiefs that were
[42:11.200 --> 42:15.880]  opposed to it most of them have come around and say you know I was wrong DA
[42:15.880 --> 42:19.240]  and Harris County Johnny Holmes was adamantly opposed to it and wrote me a
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.480]  letter about three years after we passed it and says I was wrong so it's really
[42:23.480 --> 42:28.120]  refreshing to see some folks fess up when they're wrong but San Antonio PD has
[42:28.120 --> 42:33.240]  a policy about open carry and they are not going to allow it they have no
[42:33.240 --> 42:39.360]  authority to make up the law and that's what they're doing so I hope that
[42:39.360 --> 42:43.440]  San Antonio PD complies with the law now it's more and more people move here to
[42:43.440 --> 42:46.680]  Texas we see Rick Perry campaigning to get people to come here to the state of
[42:46.680 --> 42:49.600]  Texas does this concern you at all because we have many people with many
[42:49.600 --> 42:53.280]  different ideologies it does concern me we have people moving here from foreign
[42:53.280 --> 42:57.440]  countries like California that I am concerned about as long as they come to
[42:57.440 --> 43:01.200]  Texas and they're coming here because they share our values they share our
[43:01.200 --> 43:05.560]  belief in the Second Amendment which has nothing to do with hunting it has
[43:05.560 --> 43:09.280]  nothing to do with recreational use it has nothing to do with collecting it
[43:09.280 --> 43:15.800]  has only to do with my God-given constitutionally enumerated right to
[43:15.800 --> 43:19.840]  keep and bear arms to defend myself against a criminal element or an
[43:19.840 --> 43:24.720]  oppressive government that's what it's about and as long as they believe that
[43:24.720 --> 43:28.520]  way as well as the other freedoms and as long as they believe that we you know
[43:28.520 --> 43:31.640]  don't need any more government regulation that we have too much government
[43:31.640 --> 43:35.000]  and they're coming here for those reasons then I'm fine with it I don't care
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.960]  where they come from and it's a good thing people came to Texas in the 1830s
[43:39.960 --> 43:45.320]  and 1840s and 60s because of they were seeking liberty and opportunity same
[43:45.320 --> 43:50.000]  thing today but they in my view they need to you know understand our values
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.960]  may be different than with the values where they came from are you advocate
[43:53.960 --> 44:00.080]  for a state notification you know we have the ability under the Constitution to
[44:00.080 --> 44:03.960]  ignore whatever law is unconstitutional now how do you make that
[44:03.960 --> 44:08.440]  determination if the federal government were to pass a law and say well you know
[44:08.440 --> 44:11.880]  you can no longer carry your farm or we're gonna pass a law that says we're
[44:11.880 --> 44:15.840]  gonna outlaw open carry of long guns yeah that would be in constitutional law
[44:15.840 --> 44:20.200]  and frankly I don't know if notification I just go with ignoring as land
[44:20.200 --> 44:23.760]  commissioner I travel quite a bit I spent quite a bit of time in the big
[44:23.760 --> 44:28.480]  bin national park because we have some land adjacent to it and one time you
[44:28.480 --> 44:32.560]  could not carry in a in a national park you couldn't have possessive farm I
[44:32.560 --> 44:36.440]  ignored it told the San Antonio newspaper I ignored it they wrote an
[44:36.440 --> 44:40.240]  editorial saying he ignores the law I said I'm sorry that's not the law it's
[44:40.240 --> 44:46.080]  unconstitutional when I go into border areas along the Texas border I'm armed
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.440]  and unless it's private property or the private property owner has a right to
[44:50.440 --> 44:54.760]  tell me I can't be their arm but if it's public property I'm armed and so I
[44:54.760 --> 44:58.920]  ignore laws that I believe to be unconstitutional as far as those
[44:58.920 --> 45:03.280]  unconstitutional laws do you think that extends to the TSA you know I think it
[45:03.280 --> 45:07.480]  just extends to the TSA in some circumstances it depends on how the TSA
[45:07.480 --> 45:11.000]  conducts themselves you know cavity searches of course we have some problem
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.960]  with cavity searches here in Texas with other law enforcement agencies but it
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.440]  extends to how they conduct themselves what did they do and I would submit to
[45:18.440 --> 45:22.360]  you that sometimes they are infringing on the rights and the personal rights of
[45:22.360 --> 45:26.080]  privacy other times they are not I don't think you can blink it to make a
[45:26.080 --> 45:31.000]  statement on that many TSA officers I try not to fly commercial if I can help
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.320]  it I got a little airplane I fly it or I drive now we see the city of Chicago
[45:36.320 --> 45:39.480]  has now been deemed the murder capital the United States of America even though
[45:39.480 --> 45:43.000]  it has some of the strictest gun laws so let me ask you how do you feel about
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.400]  gun-free zones well they're a target rich environment for the criminal element
[45:47.400 --> 45:51.480]  I mean I talk about this a great deal I mean was I'm probably the guy that most
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.720]  people call when it comes to the Second Amendment and firearms and I use the
[45:55.720 --> 46:01.280]  analogy had I been in the theater in Aurora, Colorado fewer people would have
[46:01.280 --> 46:05.720]  died and that was a gun-free zone it was private property and they had band carry
[46:05.720 --> 46:09.760]  and people when I say that they look at me oh that's impossible I mean that guy
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.440]  had you know he had an AR and he had body armor and all of that stuff and I
[46:14.440 --> 46:21.080]  say look the first time someone had returned fire to that in the direction
[46:21.080 --> 46:24.960]  of that shooter the first time the round had gone off and it didn't come from
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.280]  the shooter the dynamic would have changed you don't have to bring him down
[46:29.280 --> 46:33.960]  to save lives and instead of that shooter just calmly walking up and down the
[46:33.960 --> 46:40.080]  aisles you know just shooting cowering theater goers as they cowered on the
[46:40.080 --> 46:43.760]  floor shooting in the back of the head the first time you popped around off
[46:43.760 --> 46:47.400]  that shooter would have had to pay attention to something else the dynamic
[46:47.400 --> 46:53.400]  would have changed similarly in Virginia Tech 32 people died gun-free zone and by
[46:53.400 --> 46:57.680]  the way that shooter had passed a background check he was mentally ill
[46:57.680 --> 47:02.640]  had been adjudicated mentally ill passed the check anyway all of these venues
[47:02.640 --> 47:08.520]  they're gun-free zones and you know when I passed the concealed handgun law we
[47:08.520 --> 47:13.640]  had to put some gun-free zones to get the votes I needed over the years we have
[47:13.640 --> 47:19.800]  eliminated and removed many of those gun-free locations one of them it's
[47:19.800 --> 47:23.400]  kind of funny one of the locations that was prohibited initially was churches
[47:23.400 --> 47:27.360]  well I believe that violates the separation there is no separation but
[47:27.360 --> 47:32.240]  it violates the church ability to do what they wish but you know frankly if
[47:32.240 --> 47:38.320]  you have you know a congregation that's packing the sermons are you know much
[47:38.320 --> 47:44.040]  shorter and much more to the point but we continued to eliminate gun-free zones
[47:44.040 --> 47:47.800]  a gun-free zone is nothing more than an invitation you have a A-plus rating from
[47:47.800 --> 47:50.960]  the NRA so guns are definitely an important issue to you but what else
[47:50.960 --> 47:55.920]  do people Texas need to know well you know I was a guy who probably the three
[47:55.920 --> 48:00.280]  most significant items that I passed when I was in the Senate I repealed the
[48:00.280 --> 48:05.760]  motorcycle helmet law that's kind of a liberty thing and you know I passed the
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.320]  concealed handgun law I passed a constitutional amendment to allow
[48:10.320 --> 48:14.560]  citizens to access their home equity without government interference and
[48:14.560 --> 48:18.760]  telling them for what you know purpose they can access their home equity so I'm
[48:18.760 --> 48:24.520]  kind of a pro-liberty guy and I believe that government in its zeal to raise the
[48:24.520 --> 48:29.280]  floor and bring everybody up has to recognize that in doing so in order to
[48:29.280 --> 48:34.000]  fund that you also have to lower the ceiling I want the opportunity in Texas
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  to make a mistake because whether that's a financial mistake you know
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.720]  investing my money or do because without that opportunity to to make to take
[48:43.720 --> 48:48.720]  choices and take chances then we also have the diminished opportunities to
[48:48.720 --> 48:54.000]  succeed and I grew up in Texas and I went to school in the 50s everything was
[48:54.000 --> 48:59.240]  open to me and today you know I have children I have grandchildren I want
[48:59.240 --> 49:04.200]  them to have those same opportunities and I see an oppressive federal government
[49:04.200 --> 49:10.800]  that with a do-gooder do-gooder mentality continues to pass statutes such as the
[49:10.800 --> 49:16.200]  Endangered Species Act you know a lot of others so-called well-intended items of
[49:16.200 --> 49:21.680]  legislation that mindset is not here in Texas and we should be thankful for that
[49:21.680 --> 49:28.240]  but it's creeping this way and we have to in my view maintain Texas as it is and
[49:28.240 --> 49:33.640]  as it was and not only is that good for Texas Texas has the ability to lead and
[49:33.640 --> 49:38.800]  redeem this nation because we are Liberty and there are a few other states
[49:38.800 --> 49:43.720]  but we're the prime state that can redeem this nation vote Patterson.com
[49:43.720 --> 49:46.760]  all right Jerry Patterson thank you for your time sir all right thank you
[49:46.760 --> 49:49.240]  Chikari
[49:50.080 --> 49:55.200]  well that was a great report he's got my vote I tell you it just came here from
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.320]  North Carolina and North Carolina we have open carry Texas doesn't have open
[49:59.320 --> 50:02.480]  carry you got people walking around here like Sheriff Woody no gun in their
[50:02.480 --> 50:06.560]  holster of all places Texas so that's one of the things that needs to be
[50:06.560 --> 50:11.040]  changed and that's what that little back and forth there at the Capitol was
[50:11.040 --> 50:14.040]  about you got an organization there they're going to be at the Alamo along
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.480]  with some other organizations trying to get open carry and stated here open carry
[50:18.480 --> 50:22.920]  is a deterrent having a gun is a deterrent you want peaceful law abiding
[50:22.920 --> 50:27.160]  citizens to be armed there's an article today in Info Wars another defensive
[50:27.160 --> 50:32.120]  gun use that gun haters will ignore this is a guy who was in Charlotte I
[50:32.120 --> 50:35.800]  believe and he had someone try to rob him with a stun gun and he just pulled
[50:35.800 --> 50:39.040]  out his gun no shots were fired and of course here's Morgan won't pay any
[50:39.040 --> 50:45.400]  attention to that we will that's very effective a nonviolent defense it's a

[54:17.200 --> 54:22.040]  want to tell you that we just got in a shipment of nascent iodine survival
[54:22.040 --> 54:26.800]  shield as you know we were backward it sold out immediately and we just got in
[54:26.800 --> 54:29.920]  another huge shipment so that's available right now at info wars store
[54:29.920 --> 54:33.280]  dot com and we're going to be talking to Anthony Guciardi later in the show
[54:33.280 --> 54:38.440]  about recent developments and Fukushima as well as information you may not know
[54:38.440 --> 54:43.400]  about nuclear reactors here in the United States and the many ways that we
[54:43.400 --> 54:48.680]  share the same risks with Fukushima people have always looked at the risks of
[54:48.680 --> 54:53.760]  nuclear reactors going critical but they've not really looked at the fuel
[54:53.760 --> 54:57.720]  pools and Fukushima has really kind of put that on the radar and we even have
[54:57.720 --> 55:02.600]  the former head of the NRC the Nuclear Regulatory Commission saying that all of
[55:02.600 --> 55:08.280]  our reactors share the same common fault with Fukushima and calling for all of
[55:08.280 --> 55:12.280]  them to be shut down now that's the former head of the NRC but of course
[55:12.280 --> 55:18.640]  nuclear is Obama's favorite source of power he's trying to shut down every whole
[55:18.640 --> 55:23.480]  plant that he can because of this imaginary co2 crisis they like to call
[55:23.480 --> 55:26.400]  it carbon because they don't want you to think of it as co2 they want you to
[55:26.400 --> 55:29.680]  think of it as something dirty like carbon so they're trying to shut all
[55:29.680 --> 55:34.520]  those down and substitute nuclear and people don't realize the risks involved
[55:34.520 --> 55:38.960]  with nuclear the long-term risks of trying to keep these fuel pools safe the
[55:38.960 --> 55:44.880]  expense of trying to keep them cooled and contained for decades for hundreds of
[55:44.880 --> 55:50.240]  years for millennia that's a tremendous burden on the economy and it's a
[55:50.240 --> 55:54.400]  tremendous burden on energy and yet they have the audacity to say many of
[55:54.400 --> 55:57.720]  Obama's supporters in the environmentalist community and there's a lot
[55:57.720 --> 56:01.720]  of environmentalists who are very much opposed to nuclear reactors and they
[56:01.720 --> 56:07.840]  should be but a lot of them are trying to tell us that nuclear is greener than
[56:07.840 --> 56:12.520]  photovoltaics give me a break that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen is
[56:12.520 --> 56:17.440]  simply corporatism this is big business at work just like we see with the banks
[56:17.440 --> 56:22.120]  just like we see with Obamacare I guess I should call it Obama scare and we're
[56:22.120 --> 56:24.480]  going to be talking about some recent developments with that where he's trying
[56:24.480 --> 56:29.560]  to scare people into passing Obamacare but we've also got a whistleblower
[56:29.560 --> 56:34.160]  coming up later in the show in the next hour and you know Alex was talking to
[56:34.160 --> 56:38.440]  whistleblower yesterday Tosh Plumley and it was a third time he's been on the
[56:38.440 --> 56:42.800]  show talking about Benghazi and developments there and he tried to go
[56:42.800 --> 56:46.400]  through regular channels and nobody would listen to him he went to big
[56:46.400 --> 56:50.720]  corporate media they sat on the story and yesterday he was talking about that
[56:50.720 --> 56:55.280]  because he's now getting pressure from the Department of Justice and he came
[56:55.280 --> 56:58.560]  back on the show talking about the pressure that he was getting talking
[56:58.560 --> 57:03.400]  about Benghazi and the trading of arms and what that was all really about and
[57:03.400 --> 57:06.960]  he was saying that Fox News is sitting on the story well he got a call after our
[57:06.960 --> 57:10.840]  show evidently Fox News is listening to our show and said no they're going to air
[57:10.840 --> 57:14.200]  the interview so we're glad to see that happening we're glad to get this
[57:14.200 --> 57:18.800]  information out and we're glad to pressure the corporate media into
[57:18.800 --> 57:22.200]  actually reporting some of this stuff now that we the whistleblower we've got
[57:22.200 --> 57:26.600]  on in the next hour is going to be talking about corruption and the same
[57:26.600 --> 57:31.240]  thing happened to him he went to through regular channels within the
[57:31.240 --> 57:34.080]  organization that he was working for then he went to law enforcement the
[57:34.080 --> 57:38.320]  Department of Justice the FBI nobody did anything about that then he went to
[57:38.320 --> 57:43.640]  media he had Brian Ross from NBC interview him sitting on the interview so
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.280]  we're we had him on the nightly news last week and we're going to have a
[57:47.280 --> 57:51.800]  concise recap of that interview here in the next hour and we're going to talk
[57:51.800 --> 57:55.800]  about exactly what's going on with that and why the corporate media won't
[57:55.800 --> 58:01.200]  report that but that's going to be coming up in the next hour now we were just
[58:01.200 --> 58:05.960]  talking before the break about guns and about Jay Patterson who's running for
[58:05.960 --> 58:09.120]  Lane Commissioner here in Texas big strong supporter of the Second Amendment
[58:09.120 --> 58:13.480]  and there's a rally coming up October 19th at the Alamo we need everybody to

[58:19.960 --> 58:23.600]  everybody who supports the Second Amendment at that rally on October 19th

[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.360]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:43.760]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex Jones
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.040]  and we've got a whistleblower joining us at the bottom of the hour and he's
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:53.600]  going to be having some big information about banks that are too big to jail
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.640]  you've heard the story before but this is something that maybe you haven't heard
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.600]  and we're going to try to get that out mainstream media has been sitting on this
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.480]  story so we're going to try to get it some more exposure we want to talk a
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.920]  little bit more about Obamacare you know everybody is they're selling this as
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.480]  it's something that's there to help the poor but look at what's going on with
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.760]  the insurance companies stocks we've been telling you for a long time here at
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.320]  info wars that this is about insurance companies that they wrote it that they're
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:26.920]  profiting from it and for the last four years their stocks the largest insurance
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.920]  company stocks have been skyrocketing going up anywhere from two to five times
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:36.760]  Adon Salazar pointed that out in our on an article last week and now we know why
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.680]  because people are starting to get their estimates back from Obamacare and
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.320]  they're seeing that of course their insurance rates are doubling that's just
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.880]  for starters that's just the beginning they're going to continue to go up from
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.000]  there you think they're going to go down on your insurance rates they never go
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.840]  down on insurance rates but of course it's there to help the poor we found out
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.920]  yesterday that they're actually looking at credit scores now today we've got some
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.720]  interesting walk back on that that was a lead navigator that came up with that
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.680]  story today she's trying to walk that back we're going to take a look at that
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.200]  in the next segment but the question is if they're going to look at credit
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.320]  scores and that's going to be a basis what she said yesterday we're going to
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.120]  go with what she said yesterday because she was one of the lead navigators or
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.920]  the lead navigator in Florida after she talked at some length with reporters
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:29.440]  about that she came back the next day and tried to walk that back I think the
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.720]  real true story is what she really came out with at the beginning and what she
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.840]  said was that they were going the insurance provider could look at your
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.440]  credit score and decide if they don't want you in their health insurance plan
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:46.560]  that the insurance company is going to make that call I see the insurance
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.960]  companies are not allowed to exclude somebody because they've got a pre
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.640]  existing condition but do you think that maybe if somebody's had cancer or a
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.960]  major illness let's say open-heart surgery whatever as expensive as that is
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.800]  as expensive as it is even with your deductible do you think that they might
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:08.000]  have a credit problem a good chance in other words it's a way for the insurance
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.280]  companies to backdoor keeping out people with pre-existing conditions
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.720]  ask yourself this do you think that poor people who this is all about helping
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.680]  poor people do you think that poor people have high credit ratings or do
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.560]  they have low credit ratings if the insurance companies are collecting this
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.080]  information and that's yet another story that's a huge part of this is the total
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.800]  blanket amount of information that these insurance companies are getting on
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.080]  everybody and the fact that they are looking at your credit score they're
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.440]  getting your social security number they're getting everything from you and
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.280]  as McAfee pointed out when he was on the Alex Jones show the other day the
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:49.320]  fellow that if you've got a PC you've got a McAfee software on there about
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.640]  viruses and security he's an expert on security and he said it was the most
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.600]  insecure system he had ever seen there's no way to verify that anybody is a
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.560]  legitimate insurance provider instead they can pose as an insurance provider
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:06.320]  and you turn over everything everything about your life all the details about
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:10.680]  your life there's no guarantees about that that you're giving that to a
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:15.040]  verified person so it's absolutely insecure and of course it's not working
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.960]  they don't want people to know at this point how much it's going to cost is my
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.880]  opinion a lot of us believe that it's a terrible way to get into your computer
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:29.080]  once they get your IP they can go in and they can match that to your name it's
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:34.060]  one of the most massive thefts of identity we have ever seen and we're
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.000]  gonna look at a little bit more carefully about this credit score thing
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.400]  and let you decide about that we'll be right back with a couple of clips from

[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:25.160]  live from austin texas alex jones
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight filly in for alex jones
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.720]  now in the last hour we had an interview that jacari jackson did with
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:38.520]  jerry paterson and he is the texas land commissioner he i want to clarify this
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.680]  he is running for lieutenant governor i think i mentioned that he was running
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.640]  for land commissioner but he is land commissioner and he is running for
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.560]  lieutenant governor a great friend of the second amendment really understands
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.840]  what that is and a great patriot actually he really understands the
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.120]  constitution check out that interview with him if you
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.800]  didn't get a chance to hear that and it's interesting to look at this because
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.600]  in contrast we see what happened just recently in
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.760]  connecticut we had a connecticut cops sees a 69 year olds
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.720]  274 legal guns and charged him with 17 felonies
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.040]  now this guy his name is callahan he's 69 years old on monday they charged him
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.440]  with 11 counts of illegal possession of
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.200]  fire of explosives and six counts of first-degree reckless
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.680]  endangerment after finding 274 guns in his home in fairfield connecticut
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:31.000]  evidently if you've got too many guns that's reckless just like if you
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.760]  have a gun slung over your shoulder that's reckless as well that's scary
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.840]  that's alarming uh he is a retired chemist who is also
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.880]  an amateur rocketeer and at least some of the chemicals found
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.040]  appear to be for his his rocketry hobby the
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.200]  lawyer said that he's a gun collector and they are all registered they're all
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.640]  legal in addition he's an amateur rocketeer he shoots his own small
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.040]  rockets and a lot of what he had was related to
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.360]  rocketry he's even in the skeet shooting hall of fame
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.680]  but because they found some mad fireworks and some jet fuel which he says he
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:09.240]  uses in his classic corvette uh he's got a court appearance
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.320]  for october the 16th this is why people need to stand up
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.320]  for this if you're in texas get to the alamo
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.040]  october the 19th we have a stand for gun rights
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.960]  and we all need to stand together we're going to be there shooting
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.600]  cameras hopefully nothing will happen other than that but we have to stand up
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:35.640]  for our rights or we lose them so make sure you get there october the 19th
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.200]  at the alamo going to be a large demonstration for gun rights and we're
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.400]  going to have speakers they're talking about it and of all places i can't
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.160]  think of a better place than the alamo you know i was just looking at some
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.440]  alamo history and it was uh buoy who you've heard the come and take it that
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:58.200]  was at uh uh gonzalez texas and um they had the
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.400]  cannon flag there but it was actually a couple years
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:07.080]  before the alamo that the mexican tyrants actually tried to collect guns
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.840]  and buoy had moved to the area he had become a mexican citizen
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:15.480]  he had married the daughter of a mexican i think he was a mayor
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.080]  um he had built a factory there he was trying to be a productive citizen like
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.920]  many people here in the us and when they came around to collect the guns
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.680]  this is a general before santa anna he and some other guys
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.040]  basically ambush him and shot them up and
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.640]  surprisingly nothing happened for a couple of years until santa anna
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.200]  started coming around and then they started the gun confiscation again
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.760]  that's where you see the gonzalez flag with the cannon on it come and take it
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.880]  and then the shooting really started you had the alamo and then you had a
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:47.240]  goliad which is a massacre of troops who had surrendered
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:50.200]  and they took them out the next day and said we're going to uh
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.880]  gonna send you home took them out lined up up in the woods and shot most of
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.120]  them some of them ran through the woods and got away
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.880]  after those two incidents they understood that it was
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.000]  either take down the tyrant or he's going to take you down
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.280]  we need to understand that they're coming after our gun rights around the
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.560]  fringes that's exactly what general mccrystal said
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.440]  back in january when they were trying to push all this gun legislation in the
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.800]  wake of sandy hook he said we've been moving this around the
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.080]  edges and i'm paraphrasing him here but he used the term
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.000]  we've been legislating around the edges and we need to get very serious and go
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.760]  for the main thing so in other words he was saying
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.600]  we've been infringing infringing their gun rights they're never going to come
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.160]  and take them right away at the very beginning instead they're going to set
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.080]  up a lot of little entrapments things that they can use to harass gun owners
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.720]  to arrest them if they violate the technicalities of the law
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.600]  and so that's the way that it starts but we need to roll that back before it
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.240]  gets into something even more serious now the other big thing going on today
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.920]  is of course obama care and there's a breaking story that we've got up on
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.360]  prisonplanet.com david seaman pointed out that the man that's going to be
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.400]  heading up a congressional nsa reform package
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.760]  is actually the one who authored syspa and we're going to be talking about that
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.680]  later but let's go to a clip that we have this was uh
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.760]  obama running in 2008 and he was speaking on the ellen de generis
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.720]  show and he was talking about the distinctions between
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:19.880]  hillary who wanted mandated health care and what he wanted
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.720]  and we've had an ongoing discussion about health care both of us want to
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.400]  provide health care to all americans uh there's a slight difference and her
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:33.400]  plan is a good one but uh she mandates uh that everybody buy
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.160]  health care she'd have the government force every individual to buy
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.280]  insurance and i don't have such a mandate because i don't think
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.000]  the problem is that people don't want health insurance is that they can't
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.680]  afford it so i focus more on lowering costs and
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.800]  this is a modest difference but it's one that she's
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.560]  tried to elevate arguing that because i don't force people to buy
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.240]  health care that i'm not ensuring everybody well if things were that easy
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.600]  i could uh mandate everybody buy a house and
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.200]  uh that you know and that would solve
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.920]  uh you know the problem of homelessness it it doesn't yeah remember that
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.640]  he's going to lower the cost that's what he's really concerned about you know
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:15.320]  that's the affordable health care act oh how does doubling people's insurance
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.000]  lower the cost the insurance companies know
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.440]  what's in this they wrote the law they knew what was in this
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.880]  years ago that's why their stocks have gone up by factor of two to five over
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:29.960]  the last four years as we pointed out and notice what he says he doesn't want
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.760]  mandates hillary clinton wanted mandates he said if he
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.120]  mandating fixed things and he could mandate everybody to buy a house and
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.920]  that would cure the problem of homelessness except that
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.520]  homeless people can't afford to buy a house but now let's look at what was
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:47.560]  said this week by the lead navigator in florida the person who is going to
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.240]  has been trained by the feds to explain how
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.360]  obama care works that's what a navigator is she's going to help people
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.640]  navigate through the system she's been trained to explain to them
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.800]  exactly what obama care is about this is what she said in an interview who has
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.400]  gone through training to teach people how to enroll in health care through the
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:09.960]  affordable care act admits she gave bad information about credit
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:15.240]  scores affecting people's eligibility how does someone in your position get that
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.360]  wrong it was just a mistake i mean i'd been
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.480]  hearing from several people that they were getting linked they were getting
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.920]  those questions from experience some people are being asked during the
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.520]  enrollment process to link to experience one of the credit reporting
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.840]  bureaus but we learned today from the department of health and human services
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:38.200]  that is only to verify their identity a spokesperson went on to say in an email
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.920]  insurers are not allowed to factor in credit scores when setting premiums
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.520]  and at no point in the application process are people's scores
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:49.960]  accessed but here's what packham told us about credit
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.240]  scores yesterday so that health insurance providers
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.720]  can make an educated decision about who to ensure based on if somebody is
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.840]  defaulting on all their bills they may not want to have them in their part of
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:04.040]  their health plan packham wouldn't say today how she came up with
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.760]  such a detailed explanation but does admit it was wrong
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.360]  people just want to know you've been through training right
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.760]  you are educating people about the process how does this happen
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:22.360]  it's human error now misinformation is exactly what critics of the affordable
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.520]  care act have been complaining about all the time and yesterday was an example
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:30.840]  of misinformation unfortunately it was coming from someone who
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:36.120]  really should know better yeah she really should know better and i think
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.640]  she did know better i don't know which version is true
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.400]  run the clip from yesterday from about 13 seconds in because
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.640]  she went over this in a great deal of detail yesterday it wasn't just one
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.080]  statement that she made off the mark she emphasized that she was saying
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.880]  insurance providers can look at your credit score and decide if they don't
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.800]  want you in their plan the insurance company makes the
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.840]  call she talked about how yeah that's perfectly reasonable because you know if
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.760]  you're not paying your bills they want to make sure that they're going to get
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.560]  their money that's what it's about it's about getting the money to the
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.320]  insurance companies understand there's a difference between
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.960]  health insurance and health care just like there's a difference between
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:17.800]  education and school you know you can get a
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.080]  you can get an education at school but you don't necessarily
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:24.680]  need to have a school to get an education the same thing is true of health
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.960]  insurance and health care you can get health care without having health
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.400]  insurance let's go to that clip right now how much they pay
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.760]  well they say it was explained to us like this it's like buying a house or a
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.760]  car your credit score and other factors can determine
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:44.840]  your interest rate in this case it can determine how much you pay in premiums
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:49.000]  people are asking why is that being asked of me and pack them as one of many
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.040]  people called okay you can pull it out right now
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:56.040]  see that's exactly what should and in that in that original interview that
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.320]  they played she goes on for quite some time with the quotes that i just gave
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.200]  you and like you said it's just like buying a house i find that kind of
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.840]  ironic because it is just like buying a house if you
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:08.840]  can't afford a house because you're homeless because you're poor
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.520]  just mandating it doesn't solve anything and it doesn't solve anything
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.600]  with the health care either this is not a transference
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.200]  of benefits from the middle class or from the
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.400]  wealthy as they like to imagine to the poor
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:27.480]  we just had a report earlier this week where they were talking to people who
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.480]  had voted for Obama and they were very distressed to see that their
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.480]  insurance rates were doubling or more and one person said
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:39.160]  i wanted to provide health care for the poor i just didn't know that it would
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.040]  be me paying for it see they thought they were going to
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:45.640]  practice charity with somebody else's money like Ted Kennedy you know one of
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.680]  the he was one of the richest men in the country and of course he loved to
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.680]  practice charity with other people's money
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.400]  didn't like to practice it so much with his money
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.160]  but uh there's a lot of people who think that they're going to vote for this
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:01.720]  largesse out of the government out of money that's just printed out of thin
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.840]  air money that we borrow from future generations a
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.960]  debt that we pile upon them because you know we only pay
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:11.720]  our income tax only pays to cover the interest on our debt
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.800]  we've been on an interest only loan from the giant banks since they created the
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.240]  federal reserve in the income tax nearly 100 years ago
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:23.160]  and it's not getting any better that's what this debt ceiling is about they
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.040]  want to keep getting us in farther and farther into debt
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.560]  and if you want to look at a hockey stick graph don't look at the
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.360]  temperatures because that's not going up like a hockey stick
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.640]  what's going up like a hockey stick is our indebtedness
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.120]  the banks are getting us into a crushing debt that will never be able to pay
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:43.320]  then they're going to pull the rug out from underneath us and this is all
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.000]  about a massive transference of wealth and power
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.160]  from the american people to a few corporates who run the government and
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.480]  we're going to be talking about some of those banks
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:58.360]  coming right up in an interview with a whistleblower stay tuned

[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.840]  and we have a whistleblower talking about corruption in of all places banks
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:31.400]  who'd have thought i mean banks corrupt i don't know
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:36.280]  actually it's a pretty extensive story uh this is uh something we've seen over
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:40.520]  and over again back in 2010 bloomberg was talking
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:44.200]  about a different bank corruption story and that one he was talking about
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:48.200]  banks that were financing mexico gangs and it was at that time
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.160]  wakovia and bank of america this is a story this was a an event that happened
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:58.200]  back in 2006 the story is actually from 2010
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:02.440]  and they're talking about how some suspicious soldiers found
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:08.280]  in a plane that had landed near mexico city 128 black suitcases packed with 5.7
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.720]  tons of cocaine valued at 100 million dollars
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:14.920]  the stash was supposed to have been delivered to caracas to drug traffickers
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.720]  and to luca near mexico city the smugglers had bought the plane which is a dc
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:23.320]  nine with laundered money that they transferred through two of the
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.800]  biggest banks in the u.s. wakovia and bank of america
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:36.760]  and that was uh 378 billion dollars over a period of 2004 to 2007
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:42.760]  the largest anti money uh anti uh largest money laundering case in
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:46.680]  history it was a sum that was equal to one third of mexico's
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:52.360]  gross national product and this is what a person who worked at wakovia at the
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.520]  time when the two banks that was involved in it
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:59.160]  and of course wakovia was subsequently bought by wells fargo so then wells fargo
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:03.320]  was involved in the litigation and this former wakovia
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.360]  anti money laundering unit uh person who was he was the director of that unit
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.040]  martin woods said it's the banks laundering money for the cartels that
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.280]  finances the tragedy a tragedy of as i pointed out since 2006 and the
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.800]  four years between the time of that drug smuggling
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:23.160]  in 2006 and the time this article was written in 2010
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:27.400]  there had been 22 000 people killed in the drug wars in mexico of course it's
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.480]  been another three years now that total is much much greater
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.000]  so much more dangerous situation than you've got going in afghanistan for
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.720]  example but he said that he quit the bank and
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:41.320]  discuss after executives ignored his documentation that drug
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:44.600]  dealers were funneling money through wakovia's branch network and that's a
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.440]  similar story to what we have today with the person who's joining us
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.400]  everett stern he was working at a different bank he was not working at
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:56.280]  wakovia or bank of america but he was working at hsbc
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.040]  and as this article from bloomberg pointed out
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:03.960]  no u.s bank wells fargo included has ever been
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:09.400]  indicted for violating either the bank secrecy act or any other federal law
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.240]  and we learned back in march of this year after this
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:18.040]  hsbc story broke about their money laundering issues
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.560]  they were given a slap on the wrist and the assistant attorney general lanny
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.160]  brewer said defending the fact that they got such a small
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.280]  slap on the wrist he said had the u.s authorities decided to
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:31.960]  press criminal charges on any of the bank officers or personal
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:37.000]  fines on any of those bank officers or to pull their banking license the
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.040]  future of the institution would have been under threat
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.880]  hsbc he's talking about and the entire banking system would have been
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.480]  destabilized see the problem is when you don't
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:52.520]  jail people who do these types of things because they're so big
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.240]  because you have you're going to tolerate corruption
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:59.080]  from people just because of the size they are and because of the
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:01.240]  influence that they've purchased with the government
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.480]  the institution that's threatened is not hsb the institution that is threatened
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.760]  is the integrity of the united states government and we've seen this time and
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.480]  time again from our current department of justice
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.480]  not prosecuting people involved in the fast and furious
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.840]  scandals not prosecuting people involved in ben gazi
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:22.120]  and of course not prosecuting hsb and shortly after that
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:27.640]  there was another case with usb which is a swiss bank you know hsb is a hong kong
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:33.240]  shanghai bank usb is a swiss bank and it was just about a week later that the
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:37.800]  same assistant attorney general landy landy brewer went back to the press
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.960]  and this time it wasn't about money laundering but it was about libor
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:45.160]  and he said well they weren't going to really do anything to ubs
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.520]  as well and he said our goal here is not to destroy
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:53.080]  a major financial institution and the people that were there pointed out to
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.880]  them they said this is a bank that has broken the law before
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:00.040]  because they've been involved in 2009 in a major tax evasion case and they said
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.120]  why aren't you tougher and he says i don't know what tougher means
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:08.280]  obviously he doesn't we have someone on the line with us
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:12.840]  evrit stern and he is telling us about the
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:18.040]  hsbc money laundering now in the letter that he sent to ben bernacky
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:24.600]  uh pointed out that he was working at hsbc in 2010 and 2011 he saw systemic
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.680]  and blatant violations of the anti money laundering laws
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:34.760]  and a 2010 cease and desist order he had joined them after that cease and desist
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:39.080]  order and he's going to tell us what was continuing to go on there right after
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.720]  we come back these are violations that were not
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.320]  covered by the federal reserve settlement with hsbc that was in
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.400]  2012 and this is a breaking story we've got him

[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.760]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knife telling in for alex jones
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:39.560]  now as i was telling you just before the break we've seen time and again
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.400]  some of the largest banks in america involved in money laundering with
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:47.480]  drug cartels some of the largest drug cartels some of the largest drug busts
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.840]  we've seen tremendous amounts of money involved
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:55.880]  and yet we haven't seen anybody from any of these banks go to jail
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.920]  now we recently had a money laundering case
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:02.520]  that was talked about in march of this year
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:06.760]  and when it was brought up the attorney general decided that they were going to
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:12.680]  go very light on HSBC and they gave them essentially a slap on the wrist
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:16.360]  they find them 1.9 billion dollars which sounds like a lot of money but that
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:20.360]  was only five weeks worth of their income
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:24.680]  and considering the amount of time that this had been going on
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:29.000]  and the details of what had happened it was people were
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.200]  generally shocked at what happened but then right after that we saw
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.600]  the same thing happen with the LIBOR scandal involving huge amounts of money
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:40.040]  and manipulation of markets and again the department of justice
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:44.040]  just gave them a pass and said these banks are too big to fail
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.840]  we have to worry about the banks more than we have to worry about the
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:50.040]  integrity of our government more than we have to worry about the safety and
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.160]  the security of our citizens because you know these
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.840]  the war on drugs and the war on terror we don't uh
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.040]  we're supposed to be fighting those and yet it's the government that is
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.360]  funding it and these giant banks that are funding it
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:06.040]  we have a line with us Everett Stern and he was working at HSBC
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:08.280]  how you doing Everett? I'm good how are you sir?
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.440]  doing fine now this case that just came out in March
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:16.520]  they had been given a cease and desist order back in 2010
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:20.920]  the money laundering had been going on from 2004 to 2010
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:24.280]  and they said they were going to stop that and that was part of the terms
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.280]  why they went light on them they uh and the settlement agreements
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.840]  they cited HSBC's cooperation and remediation efforts as a basis for
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:36.360]  leniency in the terms imposed and yet you started
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:41.000]  after this cease and desist order was in after they supposedly had taken
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.880]  measures to stop the money laundering tell us
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.560]  about what you saw when you were there tell us about your experience and the
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:50.200]  experience of people that you saw that were hired there
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:56.280]  yeah sure uh first thing before i do that if i can just comment that um
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.480]  you know what what the Obama administration doesn't understand
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:05.640]  um is that you know by giving a slap on the rest of these banks and uh by
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:08.920]  engaging in these deferred prosecution agreements
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:13.800]  um you know uh by by you know their concern is
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.840]  that it will cause a financial crisis if they
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:21.240]  criminally prosecute these banks um and what's not being understood here is
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:24.600]  that if there's another 9-11 uh that's going to cause another financial
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:29.960]  crisis i think that's being missed um but when i started in uh in
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:35.080]  october of 2010 um you know i was part of the crew that
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.120]  was brought in to clean up their act and and you know what HSBC did was
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.560]  was um was create a uh sham anti money laundering
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.960]  compliance program i mean they went ahead
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:53.160]  um and they took their their department of 15 compliance officers if you want
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.160]  to even call them that um and they sold off their credit card
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:01.240]  division to capital one uh fired a whole bunch of
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:05.000]  debt collectors and customer service reps and then about a week later they
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.520]  rehire them as anti money laundering compliance officers which is crazy
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.960]  for transaction these are people who had no experience in money laundering no
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.240]  experience in how to detect that or they were just debt collectors that were
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:18.040]  rehired right exactly i mean i i'd be honest with you i would even
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:22.920]  trust them to uh collect that uh so it you know it's very very concerning
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.360]  that that um you know they were going ahead to prove these
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.000]  transactions but you know that's what HSBC wanted they they wanted a system
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.440]  that uh and they and they encouraged a culture
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:40.200]  um to facilitate terrorist financing and the financing of drug cartels
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.720]  now when you were there what kind of work did they give you to do i mean did
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:46.040]  they give you any training once you got it you didn't have any experience in
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.360]  money laundering did they give you any training when they brought you in
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:51.000]  no no i mean what i had to do when i got there
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.840]  uh was i went because the main money laundering facility is a new castle
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:58.280]  Delaware so but i went uh i went ahead and went to the
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.480]  university Delaware library checked out as many books as possible on money
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:05.080]  laundering and taught myself early in the morning before work and after
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.880]  um and uh you know i figured out very quickly what what what they were doing
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:13.000]  um and i started reporting uh and passing
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:19.640]  uh information to the CIA uh three weeks in and did that for over a year
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.760]  you didn't hear anything back from the CIA and eventually went to the FBI and
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:25.720]  you also gave that information to them and they
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:30.360]  were investigating HSBC for these very things at the time and HSBC was
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.400]  under a cease and desist order and yet did you hear anything back from the FBI
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:40.360]  or the CIA um the you know i i did not i uh communicated
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.360]  uh with the FBI greatly and and uh they were
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:47.880]  just as upset with the with the uh the third prosecution agreement
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:53.400]  uh as i was uh but um uh you know uh my attorneys
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.320]  did file with the SEC uh to uh go after
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:00.760]  um that's to reopen asking the SEC and the
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:04.280]  Department of Justice to reopen the investigation in HSBC because my
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:08.280]  evidence was not included in that uh deferred prosecution agreement
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.920]  um and uh i recently met with uh the chairwoman of the house finance
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:18.520]  committee um and uh the SEC uh is uh is investigating this
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:22.760]  this case right now now the kinds of things that you saw there tell us a
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.440]  little bit about how they would look for money laundering and how you notice
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:29.400]  that there were signs that maybe there were deliberate
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:35.720]  efforts to get around the traps that the computer software would look for
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.240]  specific names right yeah sure so um
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:45.640]  OFAC list um it has a list of of people that we can do business with so uh
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:49.000]  it's not ranges from terrorist drug cartels russian monsters you know just
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.560]  any any bad guy you can possibly think of and and uh
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:58.760]  that the bank has provided this list and wire transfers are not allowed to go to
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:02.440]  those people so what maybe if you have a perfect
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:07.880]  example uh there was a group of uh a chain of supermarkets in africa
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:11.480]  in gambia specifically uh called korea the supermarket
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.520]  um and that and korea the supermarkets was owned by
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:19.880]  tajako um which is a company in beirut which is owned by the tajain brothers
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:24.840]  uh who are financiers of hezbollah so the money was moving from korea to
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.120]  supermarkets uh where you know people were buying
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:31.240]  groceries uh to which was being converted into
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:36.040]  terrorist funds um and HSBC was facilitating these
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:42.920]  transactions now according to OFAC they those
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.760]  transactions should not have been going through so i saw though
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.440]  what was going on was criminal manipulation of the wire filter so that
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.440]  the wire filter HSBC had contains all of those names
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:58.760]  but for instance with tajako which is spelled tajco
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:05.240]  uh in the actual wire filter it would be tajco or on the payments it would be
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:11.240]  you know taj slash co or you know they would add these dots and dashes
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.400]  uh to not match with the wire filter so the payments would go through i mean
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.000]  you know blatant criminal manipulation right right if you put that period in
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.400]  there somebody just glances at that they or next
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.600]  or space they may not notice that but the computer was looking for an exact
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.680]  character match so they could just go in and put a period or a space or a dash
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:32.600]  and the computer would not pick it up so you're looking and the computer is
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:37.880]  actually has the correct list of of uh people that are
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:41.800]  lagged as money launders and these are organizations like Hamas,
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:47.000]  Hezbollah, Al-Qaeda as well as drug cartels like the Zeta drug cartel the
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.360]  Sinaloa drug cartel is that correct yeah exactly
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.840]  so this is uh so it looks like blatant manipulation so you contact the FBI
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:59.720]  and this is at the time no you didn't the FBI came involved after i left HSBC
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:05.800]  okay so uh i first went to the central intelligence agency
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:12.840]  because before i got to HSBC uh while i was in college and in
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:16.680]  uh business school completing my MBA i was the candidate for the
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.880]  Conducting Service so which certainly did not make me any
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:23.160]  better or less of a you know money laundering officer but
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.000]  i i felt i have tremendous respect for the CIA and i
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.800]  you know these are national security issues dealing with foreign entities
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.760]  uh and terrorists and and i had to get them this information uh not only that
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:40.680]  but what HSBC did was they went and they hired the
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:46.040]  former uh a former top FBI counterintelligence agent
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:51.480]  uh to uh run the department and i felt the FBI was compromised
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:55.240]  um and and if i can just know here that
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:59.240]  um you know i i think that individual uh and
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:02.920]  you know the FBI counterintelligence agent needs to go back to the academy
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:07.080]  because i got past this counterintelligence for over a year
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:10.760]  wow so after you left you were there for about a year and then after you left
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:14.360]  you did contact the FBI is that correct correct okay so the department of
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:18.360]  justice the FBI knows that they've got complaints that it looks
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.960]  like they're they're manipulating the names of these people so they
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.040]  can get past the filters and of course under the bank secrecy act
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:30.280]  you're supposed to as a bank know your customer and you're supposed to verify
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:33.880]  that they're a legitimate customer and you're supposed to keep track of that
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:39.000]  and report anything over $10,000 is reported to the federal government
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.320]  uh so of course in the bank secrecy act there is no bank secrecy that's that's
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:45.880]  typically the way that the government does things they
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:49.080]  they give them a name for something that is exactly the opposite
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:52.360]  but under the bank secrecy act they have an obligation to know who these people
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:55.560]  are so that they're not participating in the war on drugs
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.880]  or the war on terror and yet not surprisingly to those who listen to
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:05.080]  info wars we see that uh large banks who have we believe control of the
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.920]  government are really running and financing this war on
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:13.880]  terror and this war on drugs so uh what happens when you give it to the FBI do
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.040]  they do anything with it yeah well let me just
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.320]  uh just uh do a brief comment on what you just said
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.600]  so for instance the know your customer rule as part of the bank secrecy act
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:30.920]  um yeah i i mean you know in in theory the bank secrecy i'm sorry that the uh
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:35.640]  the KYC or or know your customer uh you know is supposed to work but what
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:40.440]  happened was was that at HSBC um there were a tremendous amount
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.560]  of alerts being generated uh and there is multiple backlogs of alerts we're
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:49.080]  talking like 50,000 100,000 so you can think of each alert as an
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:53.080]  investigation so the whole point of a legitimate
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:55.800]  money laundering program anti money laundering program
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.600]  is to uh facilitate SARs which is a suspicious activity report which is a
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.080]  report that gets reported to the Treasury
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.440]  now HSBC didn't want those SARs to be written because
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:11.640]  those SARs take time and we needed the clear backlog so there was no time
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:17.160]  so uh we had to prevent SARs from being written and and they created a very
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:20.040]  good system on how to do that and i've evidence of it
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:24.040]  um and what the FBI counterintelligence agent did
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:29.480]  was he decided to go create more leniency in the department when
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:32.360]  dealing with foreign banks so for instance
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:36.040]  a tremendous amount of alerts were being generated from Saudi British Bank
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:40.280]  you know anti-terrorist financing uh alerts i mean you know very very serious
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:43.480]  stuff so because there was just so many alerts being
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:46.680]  generated this counterintelligence uh FBI
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:54.280]  trader he decided to allow those reps at
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:58.440]  Saudi British Bank to determine whether or not
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.040]  you know the know your customer rule was was
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.160]  was met so so you're donating this to the Saudi Bank
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.320]  that we could go ahead and rely on their knowledge and information which is crazy
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:13.240]  mm-hmm so this went on after they had the
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:17.320]  cease and desist order you and after you left you go to the FBI but
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.800]  nothing essentially happened with this is that correct
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:23.720]  yeah i i mean the FBI had a you know a four hour interview with them
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:27.560]  and um you know the Senate hearing started
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:31.080]  uh you know a couple uh maybe maybe a month or two
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:36.040]  later but uh no the FBI they did not do anything they did not include my
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:40.040]  evidence in this case because they know that might
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:43.640]  see we take a step back for a second then i apologize uh
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:50.520]  but the the information that the government had against HSBC before me
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:54.680]  was very general and very uh and very vague
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:58.120]  um my evidence is very specific
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:02.200]  uh it names names it has the transactions it has the people it has the
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:06.120]  entities everything and it could literally shut down the bank
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:10.840]  so they did not want to include my information uh and that's why i'm
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.200]  pressing now for a new investigation in HSBC
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:18.440]  with my evidence so now you've gone to members of congress is that correct and
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:22.680]  you've also filed a lawsuit well i i do not have a lawsuit
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:27.160]  no okay what uh what we did was uh burger and
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.560]  mama burger and uh montague which is a a
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:35.720]  very large whistleblowing law firm in philly uh they took me on as a client
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:40.280]  i'm not paying them and they uh filed a
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:44.440]  whistleblowing claim and they filed my evidence with the department of justice
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:51.400]  with vernacchi with the sdc um and we are trying to
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.400]  instigate and and there already is an investigation being reopened into
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.720]  hspc um but i am not personally suing
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:02.600]  hspc now uh that i'm not you know there's no law
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.880]  there okay all right that's fine so you're just trying to get this investigation
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:10.600]  open because even though they admitted to wrongdoing between the period of 2004
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:14.680]  and 2010 that was like you said a very generalized
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.880]  wrongdoing and you saw that even after 2010 when they had the cease and desist
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:24.280]  order you saw that it was uh still going on and the
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:28.600]  terms of leniency pointed out that they had cooperation from hspc and that
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:32.920]  there was remediation efforts at hspc and what you're pointing out and
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:36.360]  pointed out actually before they came up with this finding you
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:39.880]  pointed out that no actually it's still going on and you
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:44.120]  pointed out some specifics and basically up to this point really nobody's paid
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.560]  any attention is that correct have you gotten anybody at congress to
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:52.120]  take up your cause yeah i mean uh i was contacted by maxine waters at the
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:56.360]  house finance committee um and she invited me down to
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.600]  capitol hill a couple weeks ago and i spent two and a half hours
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:04.680]  you know disclosing all my evidence and information and you know she was in
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:09.400]  shock uh and she she said specifically that you know my
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:14.280]  information is so specific and and um you know
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:18.360]  lethal for the bank because this could this could take them down
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.520]  well that's under the assumption that uh they're not too big to fail
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:26.680]  or not too big to jail and my understanding you know uh congressman
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:31.800]  waters did go to eric holder and uh eric holder was asked you know why are
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:34.760]  you with you know ignoring everett starne's evidence
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:38.600]  so i you know i i i think we're kind of coming to a head with the situation
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:42.120]  where they're going to have to investigate and and what i'm trying to
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:46.360]  do on my end is is alert the public as to what's
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:50.040]  going on so they can apply pressure understand because because the thing is
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:53.160]  that these animals down in newcastle delaware
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:56.920]  are are killing americans with a click of a mouse
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:01.480]  and and and and that's what i think people don't understand is that this is
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:05.880]  not a normal banking scandal i mean we're talking american soldiers are
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:10.840]  getting their limbs blown off by ied's and and and then we have foreign banks
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:15.400]  sponsoring terrorism on foreign on on on u.s soil that and in the war on drugs
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:19.160]  we've got uh over you know tens of thousands of people in Mexico that have
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:22.840]  lost their lives over this as well as 80 percent of the violence is going on in
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:27.000]  chicago isn't because people have guns or even easy access to guns in chicago
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.880]  except for the drug gangs and they're shooting it out with each other we have
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:33.320]  the former cook county prosecutor jim girock telling us
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.160]  that it's a prohibition that's responsible for 80 percent of the drug
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:41.480]  violence in chicago and the gun violence in chicago it has real world
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:45.000]  consequences this kind of corruption thank you very much everett for talking
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  to us we really appreciate your efforts to get the truth out to

[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:22.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night pillion for alex
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:27.080]  and we were just talking to evert stern a former employee of hsbc and he was
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:31.080]  talking to us about the hsbc money laundering scandal if you
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.600]  remember back in march we were told that they were
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:37.640]  essentially too big to jail and again i've got to just read this quote again
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:40.440]  this is from a system attorney general lanny brewer
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:44.520]  who said that if they hadn't just given them a risk a risk
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:49.000]  slap he said the u.s authorities if they had pressed criminal charges
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.400]  would almost certainly have lost the hsbc banking license
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.760]  and the future of the institution would have been under threat and the entire
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:00.360]  banking system would have been destabilized that was taken as a
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:07.000]  too big to jail statement and it was just a week later that we saw ubs get off
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.840]  in the libor scandal now libor if you have a home loan you know that
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:14.040]  in most cases if you have an adjustable rate mortgage
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:20.440]  that libor is the supposedly market-based metric that they use to set the
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:23.240]  interest rate on adjustable rate mortgages and
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:27.320]  ubs was involved in a manipulation scandal that involved
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:32.360]  trillions with a t trillions of dollars worth of money but of course
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.040]  they didn't want to destroy a major financial institution so they just
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:39.640]  gave them a pass and said no problem we don't want to
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.280]  really get tough with anybody well the same thing happened with
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.920]  hsb and with wakovia and with bank of america we see this pattern happening
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:52.440]  over and over again but everett stern saw this happening at hsbc
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:56.600]  even after the 2010 cease and desist order he was brought in
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:02.440]  as part of a new corrected anti-money laundering effort at hsbc but he saw
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:06.360]  problems that were very specific and he documented these went to the fbi
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:11.240]  so far he's not heard anything as far as prosecutions go he's talked to
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:15.160]  congresswoman maxine waters and she promises that she's going to talk to
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.560]  the department of justice and get something done
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:22.440]  we'll see but i definitely respect everett stern for taking it on himself
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:25.400]  to blow the whistle you know we need to have
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:29.720]  honest people in law enforcement honest people in these private institutions
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:33.560]  people like ed snowden when they see something is wrong they need to point out
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:38.120]  criminal actions that's what the society needs we need to have
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.160]  reform of the corruption that's going on in our governments
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.920]  and that's not a problem when somebody points out criminal actions
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:48.760]  the government thinks it's a problem they don't want anybody like an ed
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:52.200]  snowden to point out when things are criminal so they they think they think
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.200]  the problem is just shutting up the ed snowdens we've got to find a way to
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:59.800]  contain them to keep them in the dark or the everett sterns
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:04.200]  but we appreciate it ever when you come out and you talk about these problems
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.720]  and you've done this at great personal risk too tell us what happened to your
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.600]  personal life is always a price to pay when you do that
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:14.360]  sure um as you know i mean it always gets darker before
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:20.360]  you know for the dawn but um yeah i mean i lost everything i couldn't you know
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:24.680]  couldn't get hired i ended up working as a waiter at
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:29.320]  pf chang's and pf chang's hired me because i hadn't had no waiting experience
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:34.040]  but um i had 20 dollars in my bank account i took uh the rolling stone
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:37.080]  when i was featured in rolling stone i took the magazine down
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:40.200]  pf chang showed him my photo in the magazine and said look i
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:44.280]  did the right thing i need a job and i see help and they hired me and
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:47.160]  knowing that i wasn't going to be there in a couple of months uh
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:50.360]  you know moving on to bigger and better things but they you know have
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:53.240]  tremendous respect for them and the way they helped me and
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:57.480]  um working as a waiter just gave me a whole new appreciation of
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:01.240]  hard work and um what i mean the value of a dollar
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:05.480]  you know but it's just amazing to me that you know as these people who are
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:09.160]  still working pf chang's and that's not there anymore you know the waiters are
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:12.760]  living in a honest life uh they're not making that much money
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:16.360]  but these guys at hspc are sitting down for a lobster dinner you know they're
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:20.120]  getting into their bmw after sponsoring terrorism but they respected your
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:23.400]  integrity and you would do it again wouldn't you ever yeah absolutely no

[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:26.200]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight filling in for alex
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:44.200]  we were just talking to hsbc whistleblower everett stern
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:47.720]  and you know as you listen to the tough times that he had and we've heard
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:52.200]  whistleblowers from the nsa who were kicked out of
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.920]  really high paying jobs within the federal government and the security that
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:00.520]  they had wound up working as uh apple geniuses or working in retail going
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:03.160]  from that but these people who have that kind of
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.680]  integrity they would do it all over again just like everett said
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:10.040]  and i want you to take a look at his website it's tactical rabbit
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.800]  dot com we've had that up on the lower thirds basically what he does is it's
[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:16.600]  an intelligence company that is set up to help
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:21.000]  defend people against uh banking fraud and other types of fraud he's
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.760]  kind of self-taught you know he was looking at the situation that was going
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:27.240]  on he saw corruption money laundering there he's
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:31.400]  very concerned about it and he educated himself
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:35.000]  to detect this so you can take advantage of his
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.480]  integrity as well as his efforts if you go to that site
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:44.840]  now an interesting thing has broken up in just the last week or so with bitcoin
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:47.640]  and you know as we look at this system that the department of justice is
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:51.640]  working so hard to protect this corrupt system of fiat currencies and central
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:55.640]  banks and banks who run money to drug
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:00.200]  laundering to uh drug companies to terrorists
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.720]  who fund the war on drugs who fund the war on terror
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:07.240]  we want to see something that's a little bit different we want to see some
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:10.760]  alternatives there a lot of people have been looking closely at bitcoin and i'm
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:13.400]  not recommending bitcoin it's got some issues with it
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.400]  but it's kind of interesting to see this uh silk road site that was
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:21.720]  taken down in the last week and there were 600 000
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:25.560]  bitcoins involved and that's about 80 million dollars
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.320]  and the fbi has not been able to get at that that in and of itself
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:34.200]  is a bit of a story it's also a story to see how this is going to develop how
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:37.800]  they're going to be treated differently than these banks
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:41.400]  that are in bed with the federal government these banks that we believe
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:45.000]  are running the federal government just like the insurance companies wrote
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.280]  obama care we have the uh banks who are
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:52.520]  profiting from the war on drugs banks who are profiting from the war on terror
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:56.200]  and banks who are essentially too big to jail too big to fail
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:00.280]  let's take a look at this latest story about
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:03.960]  bitcoin and what might possibly happen
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:07.160]  with this money laundering case that we've got going here
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:11.320]  about a week ago the fbi arrested the man who allegedly owned silk road
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:15.480]  an online source of illegal drugs that accepted only bitcoins
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:19.320]  what is most interesting is that the fbi has not yet been able to seize
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:22.920]  over 600 000 bitcoins without his password
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:26.280]  the fbi can't crack it or maybe they don't want to crack it
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:29.800]  maybe they want to use it as an excuse to try to shut down bitcoin
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:33.320]  while the war on drugs has been an absolute failure by any metric the war
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:36.760]  on property rights and the war on due process has been a resounding
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:40.040]  success for the feds we've seen an abuse of civil
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:43.640]  forfeiture without due process without people being charged with the crime in
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:46.840]  many cases of people who have their property seized are never charged with
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:49.880]  the crime so one of the key reasons to stop
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:53.240]  prohibition is the ludicrous unconstitutional extremes the government
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:57.400]  has taken in property seizures but it isn't just that bitcoins are hard
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:00.600]  for the feds to seize they also offer something that feds hate
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:04.680]  even more and that's privacy under the bank secrecy act
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:07.880]  financial institutions are required to report transactions to the feds and
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:12.520]  must also quote no in other words verify customer identities
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:17.640]  in other words the bank secrecy act means there is no secrecy with banks
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.800]  but as we've seen with hsbc when large banks know their customers or drug
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:25.560]  cartels or terrorists the feds leave them alone if they're a big bank
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:28.440]  that supports the central bank fiat money scheme
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:32.680]  hsbc was caught laundering money for sinaloa and zeta drug cartels
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:36.680]  they were caught laundering money for hamas hezbollah and al-qaeda
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:39.800]  yet assistant attorney general lanny brewer had said
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:43.240]  hsbc would almost certainly have lost its banking license in the u.s.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:45.800]  in the future the institution would have been under threat
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:48.920]  and the entire banking system would have been destabilized
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:51.960]  if they hadn't just given them a slap we're going to be right back and we're
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:55.080]  going to finish up this report because it's going to be interesting to see
[02:04:55.080 --> 02:05:00.680]  how things develop with bitcoins stay tuned we'll be right back
[02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:03.880]  when an emergency happens you'll be left to fend for yourself

[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:38.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filly in for alex jones
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:42.600]  we're just talking in the last hour to a whistleblower from
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:46.200]  hsbc talking about money laundering there we're talking about how so many
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:48.760]  banks have been caught laundering money to drug
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:52.520]  organizations to terrorists and how no us jail
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:56.440]  no us bank has ever gone to jail they're too big to jail they're too big to fail
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:00.120]  they're too big to jail and now they're going after
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:04.200]  though bitcoin and we've seen a lot of noise a lot of traffic
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:08.040]  on mainstream media especially places like npr talking about
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:11.640]  bitcoin and comparing them to the federal reserve i was
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:15.640]  in the car the other day and happened to hit a npr station and
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:19.480]  they said well what is the difference between between bitcoin
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:23.320]  and the federal reserve our regular currency and they said well our regular
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:27.240]  currency is backed by the whole faith and credit of the federal reserve
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:30.840]  that was that was their biggest selling point and it's like seriously
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:35.800]  you know the the organization that can print money at will with no
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:39.320]  they're unelected it's a private organization that puts us in debt to
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:42.440]  them that's had us on an interest only loan for a hundred years
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:46.760]  that's that bank that's a that's a recommendation for that
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:51.080]  and of course bitcoin is a market-based currency
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:54.680]  but there are some restrictions as to it cannot be
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:58.360]  added to indefinitely so you can take a look at that and
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:01.560]  and it's it's very interesting but one of the interesting things about it
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:05.160]  is how it's distributed and how there isn't really
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:08.920]  any central person that they can go to to shut this down we've had
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:12.040]  several instances where people have tried to create
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:16.840]  honest currencies out of commodities out of gold out of silver it happened to
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:19.240]  a fellow in north carolina they just recently shot down
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:24.440]  shut down liberty reserve uh jail the fellow there bedofsky
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:27.720]  they can't do that with bitcoin very easily as a matter of fact when they
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.880]  shut down silk road which was an online seller of illegal
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:37.960]  drugs they confiscated 26 000 bitcoins and they
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:42.280]  got to those bitcoins but they also got 600 000 bitcoins that belonged to the
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:47.160]  person that they alleged was running silk road and they have not been able to
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:49.800]  break that because they don't have his password
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:52.840]  so it's kind of interesting to see what's going to develop with this i mean
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:56.440]  will they get it out of him with a rubber hose will they
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:01.160]  beat him until they um get the password or will he give it up as part of a
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:04.520]  plea bargaining agreement uh we don't really know
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:07.880]  if they get it what kind of mischief could they do
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:12.120]  in the bitcoin community i don't know we had first part of this report
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:14.600]  just before the break let's run the rest of that report
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:18.760]  hsbc was caught laundering money for sinaloa and zeta drug cartels
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:22.760]  they were caught laundering money for hamas hezbollah and al-qaeda
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:25.880]  yet assistant attorney general lanny brewer said
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:29.320]  hsbc would almost certainly have lost its banking license in the u.s
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:32.520]  in the future the institution would have been under threat and the entire
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:36.200]  banking system would have been destabilized if they hadn't just given
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:40.440]  them a slap on the wrist if they had enforced the laws against
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:46.120]  money laundering but hsbc was too big to jail because they serve the fiat
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:50.200]  banking system and they partner with the feds in running drugs
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:54.520]  and in arming terrorists the feds hate bitcoin because it serves as an
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:57.800]  alternative to their banking system and their control
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:02.120]  they would love to destabilize it but that's not going to be easy
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:05.560]  if the government tries to shut down bitcoin like they did liberty reserve
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:09.560]  they're going to have a problem there is no single person for them to move
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:12.440]  against like bodovsky at liberty reserve
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:16.520]  bitcoins are both anonymous and decentralized so it'll be very difficult
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.360]  for the feds to try to shut it down if they do they will drive it
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:25.080]  underground but if they can get a hold of the 600 000 bitcoins which are five
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:28.120]  percent of the outstanding total of bitcoins at the time
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:31.640]  they could try to destabilize it good luck with that
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:37.240]  it will be very transparent if they try for info wars nightly news i'm david
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:40.600]  night well that's a report we ran last night
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:43.960]  on the info wars nightly news you can see our reports on prison planet tv as a
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:46.680]  matter of fact you can see the interview that
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:50.920]  alex had with tosh plumley who is a whistleblower about
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:53.640]  ben gazi and he's been on three times with alex
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:56.760]  you can see those interviews eventually they're going to run his interview
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:00.040]  they've said on fox news they've said on that for quite a while
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:03.800]  everett stern had an interview with mbc's
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:09.640]  let's see who was it i'm not sure who it was but it was with mbc and they've been
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:13.080]  setting on that interview so perhaps they'll get interested in some of the
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:16.600]  corruption that's going on alleged corruption is going on at hsbc we'll
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:20.200]  see if that report airs we also have some news about something
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:24.520]  that you may not have heard about the trans-pacific partnership
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:28.760]  now we have some breaking news here that says the us trade official says
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:32.280]  that they're going to seek a trans-pacific partnership deal by the end of
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:35.720]  the year they've been working on this for three years
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:39.000]  now they've had talks they've had the 19th
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  round of talks was at the end of august it's involving 12 nations is aimed at
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.840]  establishing a free trade bloc that would stretch from vietnam to chili to
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:52.680]  japan encompassing 800 million people about a third of the world trade
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:57.960]  nearly 40 of the global economy now alex jones has talked about this he
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:01.160]  covered this back in endgame the documentary talked about how they were
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:04.360]  going to set up multiple trading blocks regional
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:07.400]  trading blocks and then start to merge those together
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:10.120]  that's what we're seeing here with this trans-pacific partnership
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:14.440]  there's also a trans-atlantic free trade agreement tafta
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:18.920]  very much like nafta it's a very disturbing development because what
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:22.520]  we're seeing here is just as the bill de berg conference has their
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:26.840]  meetings in secret where they plan long-term strategies and they don't
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:30.280]  allow anybody to see that we see the same thing happening here but they're
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:34.600]  actually working on immediate tactics to pull this together
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:38.920]  they're not allowing any press to be there this is a very secretive
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:43.000]  meeting between some trade reps and between corporate lobbyists
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.240]  hundreds of corporate lobbyists and yet elected officials from governments
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:50.440]  are not allowed to attend a lot of people have been pushing back on that
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.040]  ron wyden pushed back on that here in the us he complained about it
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:59.160]  long and loudly and they finally allowed him to come but not any of his staff
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:02.520]  who would be experienced in looking at trade agreements
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:05.800]  they also did not allow him to take anything away or to be able to look at
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:10.360]  anything on his computer although all of these lobbyists are allowed to have a
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.520]  password and look at this trade agreement that's being
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:18.520]  put together this is this report from business and
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:22.280]  financial news said that this is more intrusive than other trade packs the
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:26.760]  tpp seeks to regulate sensitive areas like government procurement
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:31.000]  intellectual property and the role of state-owned enterprises as well as
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.800]  giving corporations more rights to sue governments
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:37.720]  that's exactly what's happening they're changing the basic fundamental
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:40.680]  legal structure of our country just the way they did
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:47.320]  with faiza the secretive intelligence court that nobody knew about until the
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:52.200]  ed snowden leaks faiza and this is an investor
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:55.560]  state tribunals that they're setting up we've seen this
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:59.480]  already with nafta we've already seen taxpayers
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:03.240]  and these arbitration schemes taxpayers put on the hook for over three
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:06.360]  billion dollars and there's another 14 billion dollars
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:09.720]  that is being adjudicated right now according to these
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:13.080]  investor state tribunals essentially what it does is it
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:16.440]  elevates these corporations these multinational corporations
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:20.520]  because it's not local businesses it's not mom and pop stores it's not
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:24.120]  corporations that are wholly contained within a country it's only the
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:27.160]  multinational companies and they get elevated
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:31.240]  to the same status level as a state and if
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:37.320]  the state proposes or passes laws that change the investor's expectations
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:41.160]  they can sue that state and they can make the taxpayers pay
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:45.720]  but as i pointed out here this is far beyond a trade pack because this is a
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:49.320]  backdoor way to do things like cyspa you know cyspa
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:54.200]  sopa acta those were all going after our personal data
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:58.760]  also taking away due process for anybody that has a website on the internet
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:02.600]  they were going after that in the name of copyright infringement
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:05.880]  because you see these large multinational corporations
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:09.160]  want to own everything and turn you into
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:12.680]  renters when they did this with the world bank
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:16.840]  over a couple of decades under robert macnamere they were
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:21.000]  routinely criticized for seeking renter status
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.840]  from the developing countries they were multiplying their debt just like we see
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:29.160]  happening in the united states now over the last couple of years the
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:32.680]  macnameres reign at the world bank some of these latin american
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:35.960]  countries were seeing their debts increased by 20 a year
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:39.160]  basically they were trying to get them so far into debt
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:42.440]  that they were essentially like renters that they could never get out does that
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:45.320]  sound familiar to what's going on in the united states now
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:49.960]  we've got a 17 trillion dollar debt ceiling and of course that has to be
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:53.160]  raised harry reid is looking to raise that by another trillion that's about
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:56.200]  five five or six percent more he wants to keep going further and
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:59.000]  further into debt but they're also going to be using
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:05.240]  this to circumvent laws against privacy violations
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:09.480]  they're also going to use this as a secret way to put in cyspa sopa and acta
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:12.920]  so we've got groups who are defending electronic
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:15.480]  privacy electronic freedom that are opposed to this
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:20.680]  they're also going to use this to try to do an end around
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:24.920]  countries that have put in regulations requiring
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:29.080]  honest labeling on food to help people to understand if there's gmo and that or
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:32.280]  not and of course the monstanto and other large
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:35.720]  corporations here have been successful in lobbying
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:39.560]  to stop that at the state level they're lobbying to try to stop that at the
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:44.200]  national level and of course this tpp would stop it at an international
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:47.880]  level so it's not just the united states that would be getting
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:51.560]  food that had gmo in it that we couldn't know about what was
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:54.920]  what was in the food it would be hidden from many other nations so there's
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:57.800]  other countries and other people who are involved in this
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:01.640]  and there's a way that we can all come together on this so that's the only good
[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:04.920]  news about this is if people wake up and see what's happening
[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:08.520]  there are people in different strata society people who would sometimes be
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:11.640]  aligned on the left side of an issue or sometimes on the right side of an issue
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:15.320]  that would come together and oppose this because it really is world
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:19.080]  governance by the corporations it's not just moving jobs over
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:22.520]  shore of course that is a part of it as well but it's also
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:26.440]  blocking any kind of future financial regulations from these banks that we see
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:30.520]  are too big to fail too big to jail it would prevent anything like the
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:35.560]  glass stegal act to be reenacted it's a comprehensive way to give the
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:39.320]  corporations the large multinational corporations whatever they want
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:44.040]  to elevate them to the status of states we have to stop the tpp agreement
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:51.480]  we'll be right back

[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:22.920]  in the last break we were talking about the trans-pacific partnership
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:26.760]  tpp and the way that's going to impact us way it's going to be a back
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:31.720]  door to get syspa act those types of attacks on our first amendment
[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:34.840]  rights on our internet privacy our internet freedom
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:38.360]  rights as well as a way to allow the government to
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:42.440]  immediately shut down any website that they alleged to be in copyright
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:45.000]  violation without due process without a trial they just
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.440]  basically pull the plug immediately for the corporations and so they work
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:51.240]  together with the corporations the corporations get to
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:53.880]  assert ownership over everything in the world
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:56.760]  and the banks get control over everything in the world
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:59.880]  one of the things that's going to be in this trans-pacific partnership that has
[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:03.240]  leaked out according to consumer groups this is being reported by
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:07.640]  a site uh uh us a hitman they say that
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:11.240]  the tpp could mean criminal penalties for even small scale
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:14.760]  unauthorized downloading it could result in a three strikes law that would see
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.960]  households kicked off the internet for copyright violations
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:22.040]  get that kicked off of the internet you get three downloads that they say are
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:25.640]  unauthorized and you're kicked off and it could mean expanded copyright and
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:29.960]  patent terms it would mean lessened access to generic drugs the pharmaceuticals
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:33.400]  hate generic drugs that's one of the things that's in the tpp for sure
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:37.000]  as far as the street three strikes goes we'll have to wait and see
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.600]  it's something that is being negotiated in secret it's something that they've
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:44.280]  given fast-track authorization to our trade representative which
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:48.680]  means that it doesn't go through the normal channels of a treaty it's simply
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:52.040]  uh negotiated with this trade rep and then
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:56.120]  it's simply a majority vote in the house in the senate to get this thing
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:59.800]  through and then uh katie bar the doors the corporations have become
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:03.800]  governments at that point now in a related matter
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:08.200]  we've got a report on prison planet from uh david seamen he pointed out that the
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:11.720]  man hitting up the congressional nsa reform package
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:16.680]  is the one who authored syspa that would be mike rogers
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.440]  you think they're really going to reform the nsa
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:23.880]  remember that mike rogers besides putting in syspa
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:27.800]  back in july the end of july he said that
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:31.640]  justin amash's efforts to curb the nsa powers were dangerous
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:37.160]  so he came out criticizing real reform of the nsa at that time but then of
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:41.000]  course he comes back in because he's kind of the puppet for the department
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.520]  homeland security he's head of the house intelligence committee
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:48.840]  mike rogers republican from michigan is uh now constructing
[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:55.560]  a uh nsa reform bill and this just broke today representative ron
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:59.160]  widen says that he will fight the ineffective nsa reform
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:03.480]  of course he correctly understands that this is nothing but window dressing
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:06.280]  it's not going to do anything as a matter of fact
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:10.920]  probably coming from mike rogers the nsa reform act would probably give them
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:13.640]  more powers we'll have to wait and see what it actually says but the hill
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:16.920]  reports that senator ron widen has promised to fight against
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:19.640]  intelligence committees in congress that are aiming to introduce what he
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:23.240]  calls quote skin deep reform he is of course talking
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:27.000]  about the nsa reform proposals being spearheaded by
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.400]  get this diane feinstein and house intelligence committee chairman
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:36.360]  mike rogers there you go feinstein and rogers a pair that you can trust
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:41.240]  you know feinstein this is somebody who of course is always going after the
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:44.680]  second amendment and is feinstein if you remember
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:48.680]  that was talking about licensing people as journalists you know if you've got a
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:52.440]  blog you are not protected unless you're somebody
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:56.120]  that she considers to be a journalist you're not protected so
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:59.640]  as we had said before the people who are coming after the second amendment are
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:02.040]  going to be coming after the first amendment we've seen that with diane
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:06.120]  feinstein and now of course diane feinstein is going to give us a head fake
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:11.800]  for the nsa reform she was also a part if you remember the ndaa bill
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:16.360]  when they were getting that put together last year at the end of the year
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:22.120]  it was feinstein who co-authored an amendment that was supposedly going to
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:27.400]  control the ndaa indefinite detention without trial
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:31.160]  and transporting people to be tortured out of the country
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:34.840]  she supposedly had something in there that was going to
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:38.440]  control that we looked at it and actually it was pretty meaningless
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:43.800]  wording but even that even that which they used to get unanimous
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:47.640]  passage in the senate even that was just arbitrarily thrown out by
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:52.280]  senator mccain and so the ndaa has not changed
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:56.040]  now the truckers who are in washington this week
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:00.200]  they are on top of the constitution they're actually teaming up with people
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:04.440]  who were complaining about the ndaa they have a call campaign
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:08.680]  to repeal the ndaa with these truckers who are
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:13.320]  doing a restore the constitution rally in washington tomorrow
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:16.680]  and we'll we'll see what happens with that we hope that
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:20.600]  that's going to have an effect but it's important for everybody you know it's
[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:24.280]  people on both the left and the right are waking up and seeing that the division
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:27.240]  is no longer between republicans or democrats
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:30.360]  just as we see ron widen pointing it out that
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:35.720]  it's uh he's opposing both the tpp as well as the nsa he's
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:38.680]  pointing out he's going after secret government
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:41.880]  that's what we all need to be concerned about we need to be concerned about how
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:46.120]  they are fundamentally transforming the legal structure
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:49.240]  destroying a legal structure that took centuries to build
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:54.120]  we're going to be right back with the march the empires on the run
[02:29:54.120 --> 02:30:01.400]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:05.400]  why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:07.960]  on health care why do we have the highest cancer
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:11.320]  rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes
[02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:17.560]  autism and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what

[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:28.520]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight filling in for alex and
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:32.680]  i've got in the studio with me anthony guttiarty from story leak and he's got
[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:35.960]  an interesting story to go over with us three
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:39.240]  disturbing fukushima facts that the government is covering up tell us about
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:42.120]  that anthony so it's funny that we don't trust the nsa you
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:44.840]  know we go over there and try to give him a little bit of a check in balance
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:48.520]  they throw us out and say we're crazy yeah why should we trust the government
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:52.520]  when it comes to a radiological explosion event like the mega disaster of
[02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:55.000]  fukushima yeah and they say it's safe they say it's
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.680]  perfectly great everything's fine everything's happy the japanese
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:01.960]  officials have been caught time and time again admitting on record they lied
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:05.320]  about the levels they downplayed it they ignored it
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:09.560]  well their meters didn't even go up to the to the max they weren't even capable
[02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:13.160]  of recording what the radiation was we find out now that it's like 18 times
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:17.320]  higher than they said that's tremendous they turned the counters off
[02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:20.520]  they don't want you to know and my whole thing is
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:24.040]  this thing is bigger than we even thought and it's coming out more and more
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:28.680]  because even i thought you know even researching this that 2011 2012 that's
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:31.720]  where the massive amount of radiation was coming from you know we're dealing
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:34.840]  with those effects potentially they're going to try and take their rods out
[02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:38.120]  and make it explode again sometime soon maybe this month or the next
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:42.200]  but it's even worse than i thought in september last september it was found
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:46.120]  that the radiation levels were skyrocketing and spiking to highest
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:49.720]  amounts on record yeah this is going on now for well over two years
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:53.080]  yeah and it just keeps going and going and going this is a story that just
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:56.600]  they still don't have this under control it's still right on a
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:35:01.400]  razor's edge yeah so let's be clear did not peak in 2011 2012 it's getting
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:04.680]  worse yes and they don't even know how to deal with it they accidentally turned
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:07.560]  off the power i mean these this is such a
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:11.080]  mismanagement on a scale that makes me think it's not even possible
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:15.320]  to handle it so improperly it's it's unbelievable what's going on
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:19.400]  let's look back specifically as well as to what happened with all the radioactive
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:23.000]  cesium and everything like that most people think it just kind of went into
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:26.680]  the air and disappeared or maybe a little bit went into the ocean
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:31.080]  20 percent according to independent research tepco later had to admit this
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:35.160]  20 went on japanese land and started killing people there
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:39.240]  2 went on foreign lands just from this initial release
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:42.360]  78 percent according to this independent research
[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:45.880]  was just massively funneled into the pacific ocean
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:50.200]  and that's why you have fish with 258 times the quote on quote safe allowable
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:53.720]  levels of radiation coming in and people are eating it and they don't even
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:56.120]  know and they just had another release of more
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:59.800]  radiation of course they said oh don't worry about it it's it's low level
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:03.720]  but then they kind of roll that story back and said uh well there was for a
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:06.120]  couple hours it was really high but then we got that down
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:10.120]  so it just keeps going and going because they've got these massive tanks that
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:16.200]  have highly radioactive water that is from the original disaster
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:19.640]  and they see that that's leaking down into the ground so they're going to
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:23.400]  build this incredibly expensive ice wall
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:26.760]  to try to contain that because it's leaked down into the ground water there
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:30.440]  it sounds like a cartoon idea yeah it's just loony tuned yeah and then you look
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:33.160]  even huffington post now an article it's a good
[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:37.240]  article called Fukushima forever basically says it's just going to leak
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:40.520]  forever into the ocean and what are we going to do about it
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:44.440]  and people are told from the news that regurgitates the government
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:48.600]  diarrhea of information that nothing's wrong everything's fine
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:52.280]  you know it's conspiracy now even though facebook in japan is blowing up with
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:55.000]  all these people getting radiation sickness we could talk about that the
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.680]  nosebleeds they're not only saying that's crazy in your conspiracy
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:02.280]  theorist if you talk about it but they're saying that those people are
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:05.960]  literally insane yeah that's a story that we have on info wars from natural
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:09.480]  news japanese doctors ordered to cover up mass
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:12.680]  radiation sickness across the population that's the nosebleeds that they
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:15.080]  see happening now people are complaining about that
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:18.120]  on facebook and the government's responses move along there's nothing to
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:20.520]  see here this isn't something though that doesn't just
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:24.760]  affect people in japan it's also people in the u.s of course that are
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:28.440]  that are have some exposure this because it's polluting the ocean
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:32.920]  the fish as well as a prevailing westerly winds when chernobyl
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:36.440]  happened you had a tremendous amount of exposure to people in western europe
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:39.400]  because of prevailing westerlies we're going to see the same sort of thing
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:43.160]  happening here if there's a major disaster when they try to take these
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:46.440]  nuclear fuel rides out well we're already seeing it here
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:49.080]  because they found hot particles as far as boston
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:52.760]  san francisco the soil samples they found particles as well so it's already
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:55.480]  happening in just one of those particles talk to any of the experts
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:58.600]  you want to have one of those particles it's bad news it's pretty much game over
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:01.240]  the cancer might come later at a later point
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:05.000]  but just one of those hot particles is horrible and we're seeing them come
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.520]  across as far as boston i mean for the people that are saying that the
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:11.640]  Fukushima disaster has nothing to do with the united states they're
[02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:14.760]  diluting themselves it's a complete insanity that they're
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:17.720]  saying that and that's why i'm writing articles like this we're talking
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:21.320]  about this to get this out because the establishment will just brick
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:24.280]  wallet every single time because it's such a big hot issue if people actually
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:26.920]  knew about it we would freak out and rightfully so
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:30.520]  so that's why they ignore it and ignore it and downplay it and then the media
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:33.800]  you know what the media does with things like the nsa or the tsa
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:37.320]  they take what the government says and they spin it even more
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:40.520]  well imagine the government saying that Fukushima is great and amazing the
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:44.680]  media spins it further and then says his conspiracy theorists even say
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:48.520]  radiation is bad pretty much right there was a figure saying that radiation is
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:52.600]  good yeah and culture yeah yeah low level radiation is great when in fact
[02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:56.680]  low level can actually harm you more than a lot because of the way the body
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:59.080]  works just a little bit of something in some ways
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:02.440]  like a microchip kind of destroy everything as opposed to a large amount
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:06.440]  but you can't you can't see it you can't feel it you can't taste it
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:09.720]  you don't see an immediate effect this is something that as you pointed out
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:14.040]  is a long-term reaction it's like somebody an increase in the number of
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:17.000]  cancers and they can come back and say well gee we don't really know where that
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.480]  came from and there was a five years ten years
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:23.080]  yeah exactly so this is something that the government
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:26.360]  doesn't want to alarm people about and they don't really care
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:29.560]  they're not going to look out for our health we certainly know that we can see
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:33.240]  that from the way they allow gmo and other things into our food supply that
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:37.400]  we also know have long-term subtle side effects but this
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:42.040]  really is tremendous a spent reactor fuel that's there is 85 times radio
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:45.960]  activity that was released at Chernobyl so we have a lot of potential
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:49.160]  exposure to that and as you're pointing out before they're going to do
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:52.520]  something now with the fuel rods they're actually going to try to get these
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:55.160]  down yeah exactly they're going to do a precise
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:58.760]  surgical operation that some of the experts say is that over 90% chance
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:01.480]  it's going to fail and what that could mean is another
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:04.840]  explosion at Fukushima you know even though there's been countless already
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:08.440]  we don't even know the true number it could be another one coming in the
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:10.680]  very near future and they're going to try to pull these
[02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:14.840]  things out and they're possibly bent or damaged because there's been this
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:18.600]  earthquake there yeah so they've got to pull these things out without
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:22.120]  touching each other there's like over a thousand of them there the same people
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:25.640]  that accidentally turned the power off you know there's the same people that
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:29.160]  want to build an ice wall around the plants they're actually addressing the
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:31.800]  issue and of course the same people that said
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:35.080]  actually yeah the the radiation emitted from the initial explosion
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:38.200]  was not that much and then they were continuing to lie
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:41.640]  until an independent review came an independent scientific review
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:45.240]  and said it was not only two and a half times more radiation initially
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:48.360]  but that of course they were dumping it into Pacific Ocean on purpose
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:51.800]  and then TEPCO came and said yeah we were going to tell you about that
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:54.920]  you know our our readings were a little bit off but somehow independent
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:58.440]  scientists on a low budget managed to find the exact readings and exactly
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:01.160]  where the cesium and radioactive material it was going
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:05.000]  so TEPCO is a bunch of liars and they want to it's a large corporation
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.880]  of course looking out for their corporate profits it's like this it's
[02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:11.960]  if Monsanto owned a nuclear power plant that's how much we can trust these
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:14.440]  right that's right very much like that yeah the
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:18.920]  former head of the nrc is Dr. Yaxo has said that
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:22.360]  continuing to put a band-aid on band-aid is not going to fix a problem of Fukushima
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:26.840]  and he's pointed out that the nuclear power plants here in the U.S.
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:33.080]  essentially share the same design flaw and GE and uh other companies who made
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:36.920]  this reactor have gone through and they've had the Japanese government the
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:41.880]  Canadian government sign these essentially waivers releasing them
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:44.680]  from any liability for this but he's pointed out that
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:48.440]  they all have this fundamental design flaw that you've got to keep these
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:51.720]  cooling power sources continuously going no matter what
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:54.840]  no matter what happens whether it's a terrorist attack or whether it's a
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:57.960]  earthquake or a flood or a tornado or hurricane
[02:41:57.960 --> 02:42:02.040]  those backup power plants have to keep going and keep it cooling because
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:05.960]  these spent fuel reactors these spent fuel pools
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:09.720]  are just as dangerous as the reactor so just as we saw with Three Mile Island
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:12.360]  and Chernobyl we saw reactors that blew up
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:15.880]  now the public is starting to realize that the spent fuel
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:19.000]  is just as dangerous and it's going to be there for thousands of years as well
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.680]  it's exactly right and when i talk to these nuclear experts what amazes me
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:25.800]  the most is what they say off air what they tell me in emails
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:29.400]  basically that the whole system is beyond fixable almost
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:33.720]  i mean it is it's it's there's ways to do it right with nuclear power there are
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.560]  but they're not doing it right that's why three out of four or up to 90 of
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:40.840]  every single nuclear power plant in the united states right now is leaking
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:44.200]  every single one and obama wants to put dozens more on the east coast
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:47.480]  oh yeah that's his favorite source of power is nuclear he thinks that's the
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:50.440]  greenest thing out there they're not just putting band-aids on
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:53.480]  things they're just making the problem worse they're making more fukushima
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:56.600]  they're not even trying to bandage it it's just amazing to me that they can
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:43:00.520]  portray carbon dioxide which every animal every human
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:04.040]  breathes out and that plants use just like we use oxygen
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:07.720]  they can portray that as the most dangerous thing on earth
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:10.120]  and yet when you look at the most dangerous thing on earth
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:14.440]  these highly radioactive spent fuel pools and these nuclear reactors
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:17.400]  they said they tell us just the opposite tell us that's the greenest thing on
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:20.840]  earth no no no you don't understand co2 is evil
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:26.120]  yeah sustainable clean coal is evil but actual radiation and nuclear energy
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:29.800]  from power plants that are leaking 90 across the united states and fukushima
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:32.360]  Chernobyl that's all really good and radiation doesn't hurt you
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:36.760]  yeah but co2 will kill you it reminds me they had this
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:40.200]  they had this story when the wind blows they made it into an animated
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:44.440]  story back in britain it was a britain british animated film back in the
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:48.760]  back in the 80s and it was this couple who was kind of fuddy duddy and they
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:51.320]  were there was a nuclear accident or nuclear war
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:55.320]  anyway there was a lot of nuclear fallout headed toward them and they just
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:59.560]  innocently read the government pamphlets about what they were to do
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:03.640]  and it was just total baloney it was like sticking your head in the desk
[02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:07.400]  with a duck and cover exercises you know when there's incoming nuclear
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:10.360]  missiles you know don't worry duck and cover stick your head in the
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:12.600]  the desk it's the same sort of thing and that's what we're getting
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:16.200]  with these nuclear reactor issues let's put the puzzle pieces together right
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:18.840]  now here on air they're not telling you about how to
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:21.400]  even prepare prepare yourself they're not telling you about even the basics of
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:23.160]  iodine or anything they're telling you nothing
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:26.280]  they think everything's great we're turning the counters off or raising the
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:29.720]  allowable safe limits which were not safe anyway in the food
[02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:32.680]  we're just not going to tell you about anything compare that to what else
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:35.880]  they're doing in these agencies compare that to what they're doing with
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:39.160]  obama care you know burning and radiating people all day
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:43.160]  long that's safe too radiation is great but it's more than that
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:49.640]  is with the nsa the tsa the dea the dhs all of these organizations are in this
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:52.520]  same structure if they're not telling you about fukushima and the radiation
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:55.560]  that's killing you and your family what else are they not telling you about
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:59.400]  it's a simple connect the dots big pharma is killing you
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:03.480]  they're patenting a bunch of natural substances adding a bunch of toxins and
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:07.560]  then the side effects are on average about 280 sometimes 560
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:11.160]  including southern death they're making money off it they know
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:14.440]  i've had a biotechnology official i've actually talked about it here on the
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:19.000]  alex joneshow live exclusively email me in a confirmed email and
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.680]  say it's awesome that gmo's and other things like that are
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:26.120]  killing people because the world needs to depopulate and he hates people
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:29.800]  he's glad to see people dying this is the exact kind of thing we're seeing
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:33.000]  now run rampant in government and the monsanto executives are getting
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.960]  promoted the tepco guys are getting pats on the back
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:38.920]  when the radiation amounts would kill people in a few hours if they were
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:42.280]  anywhere near the plant unprotected i mean that's what we're seeing this is
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:44.280]  the government this is the establishment right now
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:48.760]  it's not an isolated incident and people realize that then i think we can win
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:52.600]  yeah hopefully hopefully with this shutdown that's going on and what i
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:56.200]  like to call the obama scare part where he's
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:45:59.880]  going out of his way to shut people out of the monuments
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:03.640]  and these are monuments that were monuments not to government they were
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:06.520]  monuments to the world war two soldiers and yet
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:10.120]  he's taking it as if it's his own personal monuments and just the absolute
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:13.640]  contempt that he has for the public and you just see this pervasively
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:17.960]  talking about the slow kill that's going on with with a big pharma the slow kill
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:20.120]  that's going on with these nuclear power plants
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:24.120]  and yet their answer is to just double down and more of the same like you said
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:27.160]  making more of the same building more fukushima's
[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:31.320]  yakso the former nrc chair said that we need to shut down
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:35.000]  every one of our nuclear reactors because they all have that same design flaw
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:38.680]  that we see at fukushima yeah exactly let me tell you a story as well
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:42.680]  when we were on the way to the nsa data center in utah to cover it and
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:45.560]  kind of give a check and balance on them just as i'm doing the fukushima right
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:48.840]  now and they don't like that that's a great story i was on the plane
[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:52.600]  and i got a little piece of napkin and it said you know support breast
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:55.640]  support the fight against breast cancer and a little pamphlet about
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:59.320]  radiation and chemotherapy treatment and on the loudspeaker they said
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:03.640]  this flight is sponsored by cancer.org everyone should go to cancer.org and
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:06.840]  donate as much as you can to help breast cancer sufferers and everything they
[02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:09.880]  had all these booklets i saved a bunch of them i want to do a report on it
[02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:15.000]  and it just shows the cheap and slimy pervasive element of this government
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:19.640]  promoting radiation therapy chemotherapy and ignoring real studies
[02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:23.720]  you know turmeric and items like that ginger there's there's a research uh
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:27.640]  the piece of research that shows 80 decline in cancer cells with the use of
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:30.520]  some of these herbs but they don't tell you about that they don't tell you about
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:35.000]  any of that it's insanity at the core and it shows this is pervasive
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.760]  throughout all entire agencies of government uh just in bed with
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:41.800]  corporations and as alex has pointed out many times they don't want you to look
[02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:44.920]  at the causes of cancer either it's not just that they don't want you to look
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:48.920]  at safe and effective natural remedies that boost your immune system
[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:53.800]  they don't want you to see the causes of cancer the gmo or the nuclear
[02:47:53.800 --> 02:47:57.560]  radiation that they're releasing so they they never really look at they don't
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:01.160]  they're they're all about treatment because there's a lot of money to be
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:05.320]  made in cancer treatment but they're not about cancer and investigation or
[02:48:05.320 --> 02:48:09.960]  naturally loves fukushima it's skyrocketing cancer cases i mean
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:13.160]  there was a piece of research done it was heavily attacked immediately by
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:17.240]  everyone in the am a within about an hour of its release that said about 10 000
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:20.920]  to 100 000 people have already died from fukushima radiation
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:25.000]  now that was attacked immediately just for them saying that not even just
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.800]  saying that 100 000 people died that wasn't even attacked
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:30.760]  at first it was just saying that radiation can do that
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:34.520]  they didn't even believe that i mean radiation now is a good thing i mean i
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:37.240]  guess we should bottle radiation and take it
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:42.120]  for uh overall health enhancement i guess cancer the cancer organization of
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:44.600]  the government the united states government in japan should get together
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:49.000]  and they should fund fukushima pills we should take them to enhance our overall
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.480]  immunity they can bottle it maybe they can
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:55.560]  maybe they can do what the nuclear industry and the aluminum industry did
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:58.360]  here you know they they dumped their toxic waste their fluoride
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:01.880]  so into our water system so maybe that's the solution for fukushima they just
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:04.520]  take those highly radioactive storage tanks that are
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:07.320]  leaking and they're trying to contain them with a half a billion dollar ice
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:09.400]  wall maybe they should just dump that in the drinking
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:13.160]  water like they like they do fluoride here you know nobody would taste it
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:16.280]  it's in the pacific ocean that's right that's right at least that we probably
[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:19.560]  wouldn't have a taste unlike fluoride right yeah that's a good point and
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:23.640]  that's the reality as well is that the big issue here is that you can't see this
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:26.200]  radiation you can't see the effects of fukushima
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:29.480]  things you can see things like people not getting into world war two
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:32.520]  monuments or not getting into the national parks and that shows by the way
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:35.560]  the government thinks it owns every single thing yes in the whole world
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:39.800]  that's owned by us but we didn't build it they didn't build it no obama built it
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:42.920]  with his bare hand he won the war not the world war two veterans who had built the
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:45.880]  monument and it's his but that's visible
[02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:49.560]  that is a visible threat or for example if you go to the store and there's not
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:51.960]  food there you want then people will be mad or whatever
[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:54.920]  a police shutdown of boston martial law style
[02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:58.200]  those are visible things that are kind of easy to win against and kind of easy to
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:00.360]  fight against the minstrel media will pick it up because
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:03.400]  they have to because we force them to the real authentic media
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:06.280]  and people will look at it and they'll get the ad revenue and everything even
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:08.760]  though sometimes they don't cover the essential items
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:13.000]  but the problem with fukushima and i do know that most of the listeners are
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.880]  aware of this but the fact is the general public is not
[02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:20.040]  because it's an invisible threat if if radiation was a big green monster it
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:23.080]  would be a big deal but you go through your average day and
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:26.280]  you don't know what's happening you get cancer five ten years later
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:29.480]  and you don't know why and then you go to the doctor and he said it's a genetic
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:32.520]  thing it has nothing to do with your lifestyle nothing to do with fukushima
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:34.920]  radiation nothing it's all safe
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:38.200]  mm-hmm yeah we've heard that over and over again
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:41.800]  well thanks and you've got something else to talk to us about right after the
[02:50:41.800 --> 02:50:44.440]  break we're going to continue to talk about fukushima and the developments
[02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:47.800]  and you haven't even gotten into your three disturbing facts about fukushima
[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:50.360]  that the government's covering up so we're going to go into that detail right

[02:53:03.320 --> 02:53:06.920]  information concerning you and your family's health. Radiation levels have
[02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:10.120]  more than doubled in the last 60 years in the northern hemisphere
[02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:13.240]  from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:53:13.240 --> 02:53:17.080]  Radiolactive contamination is now in most of the food supply. There's only
[02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:20.760]  two ways to avoid this. Move south of the equator or properly
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:24.680]  protect your thyroid with nascent iodine. Looking to protect my family
[02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:28.600]  I've done deep research. Nascent iodine is the purest cleanest
[02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:32.040]  absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:53:32.040 --> 02:53:35.640]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:39.720]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form
[02:53:39.720 --> 02:53:44.200]  of nascent iodine exclusively available at infowarslife.com.
[02:53:44.200 --> 02:53:49.080]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from
[02:53:49.080 --> 02:53:53.080]  fluoride poisoning. Survival shield nascent iodine secure your
[02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:57.800]  super high quality nascent iodine today at infowarslife.com.
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:06.200]  That's infowarslife.com.
[02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:10.600]  I hear the train coming. It's rolling around the bed.
[02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:14.840]  And I ain't seen the sunshine. I don't know when.
[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:18.280]  I'm stuck in... Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Nightfield
[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:21.640]  here for Alex Jones and there is a train coming.
[02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:25.240]  And we were just talking about Fukushima. You may think that it's old news but
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:27.960]  it's the story. Even though it happened over two years ago,
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:31.080]  there are still new developments in that. And we were just talking to Anthony
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:35.080]  Gucciardi from Storyleak about new developments at Fukushima.
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:37.080]  Tell us a little bit more about what's going on there, Anthony.
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:40.840]  Yeah, well you hit the nail on the head. People think that Fukushima is an ancient,
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:44.760]  you know, old story that happened and the radiation went and now it's gone.
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:50.280]  But the reality is just as early as September 4th, 2013, as I just wrote in
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:54.840]  this article now up on infowars.com, the radiation levels of Fukushima
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:58.760]  spiked the highest. The skyrocketed just about a month ago.
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:01.800]  So this event is not over. In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:05.800]  Very precarious. We've got a damaged reactor that's been kind of teetering now
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:08.920]  for over two years and it's not getting any better.
[02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:11.720]  Because all the things that were dangerous about it are still there but
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:15.320]  getting older. And this TEPCO company, they have
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:18.200]  workers that have a history of accidentally turning the power off,
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:21.880]  just destroying everything, using tape to fill in holes.
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:25.800]  They're going to go in and try and surgically attack
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:28.680]  one of these rods and try and stabilize it a little bit.
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:32.680]  And some of the experts I talked to said there's a 96% chance they will fail.
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:35.320]  And I don't want them to fail. I don't want that to happen. I wish, you know,
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:38.680]  Fukushima would resolve it self-magically, but that's not going to happen.
[02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:41.880]  And that's why we have to hit this on the head over and over and over again
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:46.520]  because the government is covering this up 101. I mean, this is the very basics.
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:49.800]  And as you were saying in the previous segment, we've already had,
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:52.920]  as far away as Boston, we've seen evidence of
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:56.440]  wind-borne radiation coming in. So if they have
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:55:59.240]  another explosive event trying to remove these rods,
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:02.920]  that's going to have massive consequences for the United States, which is
[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:05.720]  prevailing. Westerlies are going to bring it to us versus going to go over the
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:08.360]  Pacific Ocean, contaminate fish, contaminate food.
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:11.800]  Then it's headed for the United States and not just the West Coast, as you point
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:15.080]  out, Boston as well. According to the doctors I talked to,
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:18.440]  in the event of another explosion, which looks like it may happen if they go in,
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:21.320]  if they're foolish enough to go in and tamper with these rods again,
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:24.840]  not only will the workers, unfortunately, most likely die,
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:28.600]  but you'll have about a month to prepare yourself. About one month after that
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:32.440]  happens, you better get yourself prepared. And we know now
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:36.920]  that the plant operators have been caught on record faking the readings of
[02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:39.640]  the radiation levels. They've been caught dumping it into
[02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:43.160]  the Pacific Ocean. They've been time and time again
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:46.440]  caught saying that, you know, it's over, it's fine, it's better now when the
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:50.040]  radiation levels are hitting new highs. This is something that if we don't
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:53.400]  force into the media, if we don't force into the radar of the
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:57.880]  general public, we'll just be like this cancerous tumor on the body of the
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:00.600]  planet. We're not even talking about just the United States right now. I mean,
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:04.200]  this will obliterate the planet with radiation if it
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:07.000]  ultimately does explode and they're crazy enough to do this.
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.080]  Absolutely. And that's just one of the nuclear power plants.
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:12.360]  All right, so you've got Natural Society, which is the third largest natural health
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:15.080]  site. What would you recommend that we do to prepare
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:18.440]  for it? Okay, so one of the things that I've always had a challenge with is
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:21.880]  finding something to prepare myself for pretty much any disaster.
[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:25.800]  And when I started Natural Society, it's because I recovered from Lyme disease
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:28.680]  naturally and no one believed me and I wanted to write about it.
[02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:31.640]  And thankfully, yeah, we get millions of visitors now. My also other website,
[02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:36.040]  StoryLeague.com is doing well too. But what it came down to is I met Dr. Edward
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:39.480]  Group, who's been on this show before and did an excellent job. It was an amazing
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:43.960]  interview. And we determined that to prepare ourselves, we wanted to create a
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:47.960]  form of iodine. But we looked, there was different forms of iodine in the market.
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:52.280]  They contain GMOs, artificial sweeteners, similar to aspartame, artificial
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:56.360]  preservatives, and even worse. I mean, it's to the point now where some of the bottles
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:58:00.680]  would dissolve the glass droppers within a month and just destroy it. So it has to
[02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:05.480]  be stable. We came up with a nascent iodine form, talked to Alex. He tested it out
[02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:09.160]  thoroughly because he was on a mission to find as well the best, absolute best form
[02:58:09.160 --> 02:58:11.800]  for him and his family that he wanted to give it to his kids too, which was
[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:16.360]  essential. Came up with InfoWarsLife Survival Shield, nascent iodine. Perhaps
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:20.520]  we can talk about it specifically, but it is the best form, non-GMO, vegan,
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:23.720]  kosher. It's the only one I take, the only one Alex takes, period.
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:27.320]  And we just got, we were, when we introduced that, it immediately flew off the
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:30.920]  shelves. We didn't have any more supply left. We've got a new supply in now, right?
[02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:34.680]  It's coming in, yeah. So I would recommend everyone get this, prepare yourself
[02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:38.200]  in the event of a disaster. Well, that's it for tonight. We'll be back
[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:50.040]  tomorrow at 11 Central, 12 Eastern. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
