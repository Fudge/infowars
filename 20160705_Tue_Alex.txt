[00:00.000 --> 00:07.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[00:07.400 --> 00:09.600]  a war on for your mind.
[00:09.600 --> 00:24.440]  Here we are Tuesday, July 5th, 2016 on your host Alex Jones.
[00:24.440 --> 00:28.080]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, best sounding author and researcher will be joining us to discuss the
[00:28.080 --> 00:31.960]  shocking developments which really aren't too shocking when you realize how corrupt
[00:31.960 --> 00:35.840]  this out-of-control bureaucracy in government is and far and interested of hijacked the
[00:35.840 --> 00:36.840]  nation.
[00:36.840 --> 00:40.880]  He'll be discussing with us what just happened about 45 minutes ago or less, so that is
[00:40.880 --> 00:46.920]  the FBI Director, Mr. Kumi, coming out and saying there will not be any indictment.
[00:46.920 --> 00:53.000]  We're also going to have Roger Stone joining us with huge breaking news and Trump information,
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.400]  and we are also going to have a roundtable discussion with Jakari Jackson, Leigh Ann
[00:56.400 --> 01:02.000]  McAdoo and David Knight and myself from two of our studios here in central Texas.
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.160]  But make no mistake, what you've seen happen is another signpost showing how deep we've
[01:07.160 --> 01:14.400]  gone down the rat hole, and this is really an arrogant declaration of independence against
[01:14.400 --> 01:16.960]  the rule of law.
[01:16.960 --> 01:22.000]  Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.360]  classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such
[01:27.360 --> 01:29.760]  a case.
[01:29.760 --> 01:34.080]  Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before deciding whether to bring charges.
[01:34.080 --> 01:39.520]  They're obvious considerations like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.
[01:39.520 --> 01:44.680]  Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person's actions and how similar situations
[01:44.680 --> 01:47.680]  have been handled in the past.
[01:47.680 --> 01:53.760]  In looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information,
[01:53.760 --> 01:58.600]  we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.
[01:58.600 --> 02:05.560]  General Patress and countless other cases, here's the difference.
[02:05.560 --> 02:16.680]  When Colin Powell in 1991, 1992, right until about 1993 or so when they left office was
[02:16.680 --> 02:21.920]  doing this, email was brand new even in the executive branch of the government, been around
[02:21.920 --> 02:24.560]  for decades in scientific circles.
[02:24.560 --> 02:26.440]  But it was a new thing.
[02:26.440 --> 02:34.240]  The rules and laws were developed after that, and by the 2008 to 2010s, they knew exactly
[02:34.240 --> 02:35.240]  what they were doing.
[02:35.240 --> 02:40.720]  That's why she was ordering them to cut the headers off of classified material.
[02:40.720 --> 02:42.560]  And she knew her servers were compromised.
[02:42.560 --> 02:45.680]  I guarantee you what this is, is them shelling data.
[02:45.680 --> 02:48.160]  It's a drop box.
[02:48.160 --> 02:51.560]  And then she could just plausibly say, oh, I didn't know anybody was getting in there.
[02:51.560 --> 02:56.520]  It's better than going to the park and putting the briefcase under the park bench.
[02:56.520 --> 03:01.680]  This countless spies have been caught doing or leaving in their trash, and then the spies
[03:01.680 --> 03:02.680]  come by and get it.
[03:02.680 --> 03:05.800]  She can try to deny what's happened.
[03:05.800 --> 03:11.080]  And it's Lynch meeting in secret with Clinton on the plane last week, and things like that
[03:11.080 --> 03:13.000]  that really show the criminal intent.
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.440]  And there's clear charges that she's lied to federal officers, there's clear evidence
[03:16.440 --> 03:21.840]  that she has tried to deceive Congress.
[03:21.840 --> 03:29.200]  And the FBI director is clearly compromised, and he is clearly moving this country towards
[03:29.200 --> 03:32.240]  light speed dictatorship, because the sky's the limit.
[03:32.240 --> 03:35.440]  Imagine if you're Hillary Clinton right now, what's going through your mind, that you can
[03:35.440 --> 03:37.200]  get away with anything.
[03:37.200 --> 03:42.040]  Now, in an earlier part of the press conference, he built up the criminal negligence.
[03:42.040 --> 03:45.160]  He built up how horrible it was.
[03:45.160 --> 03:48.880]  And a, quote, strong slap on the wrist is what CNN said.
[03:48.880 --> 03:55.440]  A strong slap on the wrist, maybe if her constituents cared, but they love criminality
[03:55.440 --> 03:56.440]  by their own party.
[03:56.440 --> 04:02.000]  They love foreign interest in the Saudis, giving her a hundred million in Gulf states.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.920]  They don't care if they're throwing gays off buildings and chopping their heads off.
[04:04.920 --> 04:05.920]  It's not about that.
[04:05.920 --> 04:11.520]  It's about virtue signaling to each other that they're trendy and they're good and
[04:11.520 --> 04:12.520]  they care.
[04:12.520 --> 04:15.320]  The truth is there are a bunch of pirates that want to loot the middle class further
[04:15.320 --> 04:18.080]  and want more free goodies.
[04:18.080 --> 04:20.760]  And Hillary is promising her minions she will do that.
[04:20.760 --> 04:28.440]  Now if the way Barack Obama treated black Americans, less visits to inner city areas,
[04:28.440 --> 04:34.640]  funding the actual programs that were helping inner city people being cut, black unemployment
[04:34.640 --> 04:42.220]  roughly doubling and more than doubling the average unemployment growth that we saw here
[04:42.220 --> 04:43.720]  in the United States.
[04:43.720 --> 04:46.440]  So it's clearly seconding.
[04:46.440 --> 04:48.120]  We've got that clip coming up and a lot more.
[04:48.120 --> 04:49.280]  It's a big broadcast today.
[04:49.280 --> 04:53.240]  We're also going to open the phones up so you can sound off and give us your take on
[04:53.240 --> 04:54.240]  the situation.
[04:54.240 --> 04:57.520]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[04:57.520 --> 05:00.320]  Brooke and Hillary above the law.
[05:00.320 --> 05:01.320]  Let's face it.
[05:01.320 --> 05:05.400]  Most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones, but recent studies link cell phone
[05:05.400 --> 05:08.920]  use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.640]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[05:12.640 --> 05:16.680]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable.
[05:16.680 --> 05:21.000]  So keep the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.640]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your
[05:25.640 --> 05:26.640]  sperm.
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.160]  Lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[05:31.160 --> 05:33.800]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[05:33.800 --> 05:37.320]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is
[05:37.320 --> 05:39.280]  actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[05:39.280 --> 05:43.080]  This causes insomnia and slow somatabolism, low weight gain.
[05:43.080 --> 05:47.520]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency
[05:47.520 --> 05:48.520]  radiation.
[05:48.520 --> 05:50.600]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[05:50.600 --> 05:53.160]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[05:53.160 --> 05:54.160]  Use headphones.
[05:54.160 --> 05:57.360]  And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[05:57.360 --> 06:01.760]  Be in Makadu with your info wars tip of the week, not a group you develop living defense
[06:01.760 --> 06:02.760]  for us.
[06:02.760 --> 06:03.760]  It took you over a year to do it.
[06:03.760 --> 06:05.240]  Why is this so good?
[06:05.240 --> 06:09.840]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[06:09.840 --> 06:14.560]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[06:14.560 --> 06:15.560]  my system.
[06:15.560 --> 06:20.800]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[06:20.800 --> 06:26.080]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[06:26.080 --> 06:27.340]  disease around.
[06:27.340 --> 06:29.960]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[06:29.960 --> 06:30.960]  These are all parasites.
[06:30.960 --> 06:33.680]  Tell us about all the stuff that said that there's so many things that are in it.
[06:33.680 --> 06:34.920]  You have the neem in there.
[06:34.920 --> 06:38.000]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.360]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[06:41.360 --> 06:42.360]  All right.
[06:42.360 --> 06:44.360]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[06:44.360 --> 06:45.640]  It just came back in yesterday.
[06:45.640 --> 06:46.640]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.

[06:54.560 --> 06:56.800]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[06:56.800 --> 07:00.600]  Thank you so much for all your work starting on this great product.
[07:00.600 --> 07:04.600]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[07:04.600 --> 07:09.960]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.
[07:09.960 --> 07:14.920]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[07:14.920 --> 07:16.520]  at infowarsore.com.
[07:16.520 --> 07:20.360]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[07:20.360 --> 07:24.460]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[07:24.460 --> 07:29.680]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:29.680 --> 07:33.760]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[07:33.760 --> 07:35.560]  the products that you need each month.
[07:35.560 --> 07:40.160]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and

[08:07.480 --> 08:22.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[08:22.360 --> 08:28.040]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[08:28.040 --> 08:36.560]  They've been running the clock on us, we've been hearing for a year that Comey is a tough
[08:36.560 --> 08:41.360]  guy and he's going to die at Hillary because after all they have to look at it and betray
[08:41.360 --> 08:42.600]  us for far less.
[08:42.600 --> 08:48.720]  It's not just her engaged in espionage, putting classified material on a server and then foreign
[08:48.720 --> 08:52.800]  donors giving her money to her foundation, what it was was a drop box in my educated
[08:52.800 --> 08:55.800]  research view.
[08:55.800 --> 08:59.200]  The bottom line is she knew what she was doing so regardless it's espionage.
[08:59.200 --> 09:00.880]  Where are the espionage charges?
[09:00.880 --> 09:06.840]  Forget violating the national security act or whatever, forget violating a secrecy act
[09:06.840 --> 09:10.400]  with secret documents, that's bad enough, it's nothing compared to the willful intent
[09:10.400 --> 09:14.440]  of knowing you're on a compromised server and then lying to the public and saying she
[09:14.440 --> 09:18.000]  didn't have the server or saying she didn't know it had been hacked or saying it never
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.000]  had been hacked.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.960]  Just a few months ago our reporters talked to her on the campaign trail, she was still
[09:21.960 --> 09:27.440]  saying her servers weren't hacked when everyone knew a year ago they were.
[09:27.440 --> 09:30.960]  And now the FBI directors come out and said they were hacked.
[09:30.960 --> 09:34.720]  It was very frustrating watching the press conference because he says all the horrible
[09:34.720 --> 09:38.080]  things she's done or he says a lot of it and then he just says by the way we're not going
[09:38.080 --> 09:44.840]  to indict because no reasonable prosecutor could prosecute her with this information.
[09:44.840 --> 09:46.080]  What?
[09:46.080 --> 09:51.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the lying to federal officers, the lying to Congress, changing
[09:51.600 --> 09:57.880]  her story so many times it makes my head spin.
[09:57.880 --> 10:06.120]  You have her right there and then you've got her getting money from third world dictators
[10:06.120 --> 10:10.960]  to then take restrictions off the State Department for technology and weapons transfers, that's
[10:10.960 --> 10:16.080]  a whole separate area and the missile secrets in the 90s of the communist Chinese on and
[10:16.080 --> 10:20.000]  on and on, Roger Stone's coming on about it today, we're going to repost the top of
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.360]  themfallwars.com story he wrote for us exclusively for July 4th that gets into reminding folks
[10:26.360 --> 10:34.320]  the documented technology, the entire system, the miniaturization systems, the reentry
[10:34.320 --> 10:40.320]  systems, the multiple warhead targeting systems, the MIRV technology, the first stage boost
[10:40.320 --> 10:49.960]  technology, the second stage boost technology, the reentry technology, the GPS systems, every
[10:49.960 --> 11:01.240]  thing, the entire shop of ICBM technology developed here in the United States.
[11:01.240 --> 11:07.080]  Second to none, the German technology we had and developed by the 60s is better than what
[11:07.080 --> 11:16.840]  the Russians have today but all the designs were accidentally destroyed to a whole group
[11:16.840 --> 11:24.040]  of rockets, not just the Saturn series and I don't want to digress but this is the deliberate
[11:24.040 --> 11:27.320]  sabotage of this country.
[11:27.320 --> 11:32.040]  By the way, the Russians have the best super heavy boosters but a bunch of other classes
[11:32.040 --> 11:35.240]  in the United States have better ones and the point is that we have to go to Russia
[11:35.240 --> 11:40.920]  now to get our boosters and then what was left of our technology was given to the communist
[11:40.920 --> 11:48.000]  Chinese, I mean this is just the most flagrant, over the top ridiculous treason you could imagine
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  but I'm digressing.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.960]  Today I want to talk about the crimes of Hillary Clinton because the court of public opinion,
[11:52.960 --> 11:56.840]  they may think they're above the law and declared independence against the people and against
[11:56.840 --> 12:00.880]  rule of law but let me tell you something, you can't stop the court of public opinion
[12:00.880 --> 12:05.040]  and you can't stop the American people across the board realizing that under this globalist
[12:05.040 --> 12:09.440]  economic system we're being screwed over and Obama was used as the leftist front to get
[12:09.440 --> 12:13.520]  that globalist corporatist agenda through and now they're going to have the ridiculous
[12:13.520 --> 12:20.000]  stunt of a woman with her female running mate is the word and that half her cabinet will
[12:20.000 --> 12:21.000]  be women.
[12:21.000 --> 12:32.600]  This is a total stunt gimmick, absolute complete gimmick and so we're going to get to hear
[12:32.600 --> 12:38.320]  that we're against women now because we're against this crime boss Hillary Clinton and
[12:38.320 --> 12:44.720]  she stole the nomination openly from Bernie Sanders, openly and of course he rolled over
[12:44.720 --> 12:56.080]  and just everything's being given to her because she is so incredibly compromised.
[12:56.080 --> 13:00.600]  And now there's new reports out, Huma, Hillary flouted protocol used burn bags and destroyed
[13:00.600 --> 13:09.240]  documents prohibited by federal regulations and laws. Abidine also admitted to being aware
[13:09.240 --> 13:17.800]  of her obligation to delete federal records or destroy federal records. Again, aware of
[13:17.800 --> 13:23.080]  her obligation not to delete federal records, not to delete federal records or destroy federal
[13:23.080 --> 13:24.080]  records.
[13:24.080 --> 13:28.440]  So they're all admitting that they broke the law now and saying that they were ordered
[13:28.440 --> 13:32.440]  to do this by Hillary and it's like it's okay. As long as you will say she ordered you to
[13:32.440 --> 13:38.280]  do it, she's above the law so everybody gets a pass. So there's the headline FBI recommends
[13:38.280 --> 13:43.640]  no charges against Clinton and email probe. I had Dan Bongino senior retired secret service
[13:43.640 --> 13:48.600]  agent and he's like no, no, they're going to indict her. That's the word. No, they're
[13:48.600 --> 13:58.240]  not because we have the word directly from the highest levels and we told you here last
[13:58.240 --> 14:04.160]  week that she would not be indicted with Larry Nichols and with others. And Trump, you notice
[14:04.160 --> 14:08.320]  came out a day before anybody else didn't said the word is no indictment for crooked
[14:08.320 --> 14:15.520]  Hillary because don't think for a minute the average FBI agent and even senior people
[14:15.520 --> 14:22.960]  are not completely freaked out by this. This woman is completely absolutely a total megalomaniac.
[14:22.960 --> 14:28.240]  In fact, I took an image of her today that really shows her evil and I tweeted it out
[14:28.240 --> 14:31.640]  at real Alex Jones. At least I was getting ready to when we were about to go live. I
[14:31.640 --> 14:34.560]  asked Don to do it. He's probably already done it. Can you guys go to my Twitter for
[14:34.560 --> 14:39.280]  TV viewers? I want to show folks the tweet I put out and then I'm going to go to Trump's
[14:39.280 --> 14:44.600]  tweet and just read through these and just imagine having this guy as president versus
[14:44.600 --> 14:49.760]  Hillary who's singing in had up there in a white outfit like she was a goddess and then
[14:49.760 --> 14:57.120]  flared the the iris up where she burns like a God and they said golden God. This is this
[14:57.120 --> 15:02.440]  is who the power structure wants and because she will be like a God politically when all
[15:02.440 --> 15:06.920]  these criminals get behind her and make her above the law. She can do anything she wants
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.200]  and she said what that is start a bunch of wars jack up taxes come after our guns go
[15:12.200 --> 15:21.080]  after better clingers. It's on. Let's go back to my Twitter please. Real Alex Jones. Very
[15:21.080 --> 15:26.920]  evil image of Hillary. Yeah, there it is. There it is. Scroll back down. There you go.
[15:26.920 --> 15:31.480]  Look at that look on her face. If you're a radio listener, go to real Alex Jones. By
[15:31.480 --> 15:35.720]  the way, it's come out that, you know, Hillary has 90 some percent fake Twitter followers
[15:35.720 --> 15:40.360]  and so does Obama and so does Michelle Obama. We don't have any fake followers. We don't
[15:40.360 --> 15:45.640]  want fake followers. I can go out and buy 10 million followers for like $20,000 and most
[15:45.640 --> 15:49.720]  of them aren't even real people and then say how big I am on Twitter are 3 million people
[15:49.720 --> 15:54.000]  that follow us on Facebook. Real 400,000 people that follow us on Twitter all together is
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.280]  about a million real that if you knew that you do need to follow us there because we
[15:58.280 --> 16:01.640]  were kind of late to the game getting into Twitter years ago and it's important we able
[16:01.640 --> 16:06.800]  to stay in contact with you on more platforms. But going back to the image that says it all
[16:06.800 --> 16:10.080]  there certainly have been Garrison image that says I'm with her the grim reaper showing
[16:10.080 --> 16:15.440]  all the different wars she started and lied about and then I I see some leftist going
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.760]  Oh, but it was okay when George Bush did it. No, we weren't against that. The difference
[16:19.760 --> 16:26.480]  is Bush didn't actually openly aid ISIS and Al Qaeda to go in and overthrow Christian
[16:26.480 --> 16:33.360]  countries and our allies like Egypt or double cross Qaddafi and set him up or double cross
[16:33.360 --> 16:39.920]  Assad to try to put ISIS in that's let's be conservative 50 times worse than Assad.
[16:39.920 --> 16:46.760]  Calling our 30 plus year allies who are pro-western and had brought real stability to Egypt they
[16:46.760 --> 16:53.240]  overthrew them and they blew up more than 300 churches and killed over 100,000 Christians
[16:53.240 --> 16:57.600]  and the Egyptian military said why are you backing ISIS and Al Qaeda before was even
[16:57.600 --> 17:03.320]  known as ISIS. That's what our government did. That's who Hillary's behind. That's who
[17:03.320 --> 17:08.920]  she works with. That's who these people are. They are out to get us folks. They're not
[17:08.920 --> 17:15.920]  playing games. They're bizarre and Hillary's promising to go to the center if she gets
[17:15.920 --> 17:22.400]  elected bull. She is never going to stop. She is going to go for total broke once she's
[17:22.400 --> 17:30.800]  in office and this is America's maker to break in time and I'm here to tell you. Everybody
[17:30.800 --> 17:36.560]  is going to ruin the day that we didn't stop Hillary Clinton. I don't enjoy going up against
[17:36.560 --> 17:41.520]  a crime boss like her. I don't enjoy actually mobilizing people nationwide in something
[17:41.520 --> 17:48.040]  that is at my level a very dangerous exercise. I'm a father of three but I'm here to tell
[17:48.040 --> 17:52.160]  you my children have no future in the long term if we don't turn this around so I'm
[17:52.160 --> 17:56.600]  all in and I know you're all in as well and believe me. Bill Clinton looks like he's
[17:56.600 --> 18:01.800]  about to die any minute. Hillary Clinton looks completely mentally ill. Even if she gets
[18:01.800 --> 18:06.000]  into office though I think she'll end up collapsing or going insane or something because she's
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.320]  definitely mentally ill. She's definitely on drugs. She's definitely burnout. So don't
[18:10.320 --> 18:13.520]  worry. God works in mysterious ways. We've just got to do the right thing and God will
[18:13.520 --> 18:16.440]  carry us the rest of the way with Providence because there's a lot of awakening happening
[18:16.440 --> 18:21.880]  right now and who knows they may bring Hillary in and then the global collapse happens and
[18:21.880 --> 18:25.320]  you know world government gets in more trouble. Look at the British exit and what's happening
[18:25.320 --> 18:29.960]  with 30 nations want to leave the euro right now. So you know what we just got to move
[18:29.960 --> 18:34.200]  forward do the right thing. Justice be done may the heavens fall. Now I'm going to open
[18:34.200 --> 18:38.680]  the phones up and I want first time callers in the first round to be able to speak specifically
[18:38.680 --> 18:41.480]  to the non indictment and where you think this is going. Do you think there'll be other
[18:41.480 --> 18:46.040]  in talk of other indictments. I think this shows the sky's the limit for the establishment.
[18:46.040 --> 18:49.960]  I think this shows a blank check a declaration of independence against due process but I
[18:49.960 --> 18:54.800]  want to know and declaration of independence against justice and a declaration of independence
[18:54.800 --> 18:59.960]  by the criminals on July 4th against the American people. That's what this is all about. 800
[18:59.960 --> 19:07.200]  2599231 800 2599231 and we'll get you up and on the air. What do you think the next
[19:07.200 --> 19:13.240]  shooter drop will be. Let's go out to break with crooked Hillary. This is the FBI director
[19:13.240 --> 19:19.400]  recommends no charges. Here it is. Although there is evidence of potential violations
[19:19.400 --> 19:24.520]  of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information. Our judgment is that
[19:24.520 --> 19:30.040]  no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number
[19:30.040 --> 19:34.560]  of factors before deciding whether to bring charges. They're obvious considerations like
[19:34.560 --> 19:40.080]  the strength of the evidence especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider
[19:40.080 --> 19:44.840]  the context of a person's actions and how similar situations have been hanging in the
[19:44.840 --> 19:48.920]  past. That's enough. Let's go to break. In similar situations they've indicted people
[19:48.920 --> 19:52.440]  and what you have done here a little bit of a Freudian slip there as they set a precedent
[19:52.440 --> 19:56.480]  now where prosecutors are going to say oh you got thousands of documents foreign governments
[19:56.480 --> 20:00.920]  are accessing everyone else's felony. That's okay.

[21:09.600 --> 21:14.440]  we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen solar
[21:14.440 --> 21:20.080]  generators really do provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators
[21:20.080 --> 21:25.080]  run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous
[21:25.080 --> 21:29.880]  summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer
[21:29.880 --> 21:33.240]  through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one
[21:33.240 --> 21:38.640]  this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[21:38.640 --> 21:43.120]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition

[22:03.920 --> 22:08.600]  to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia,
[22:08.600 --> 22:13.360]  fluorine and chloramines. And pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[22:13.360 --> 22:17.920]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[24:07.200 --> 24:17.320]  So the world really is divided into two different groups of people. Those that are informed
[24:17.320 --> 24:21.760]  and those that are uninformed. There are some people that are informed that are trying to
[24:21.760 --> 24:26.120]  build a free open society. There are other people that are informed that are feeding
[24:26.120 --> 24:35.160]  on the groups that are not aware of what's happened. And it is the arrogance, it is the
[24:35.160 --> 24:41.640]  fact that so many ignorant people are willfully ignorant and like to be ignorant. That really
[24:41.640 --> 24:46.520]  is our downfall overall. There's videos up on infowars.com where the majority of Americans
[24:46.520 --> 24:52.120]  out on the street in California think the United States is 2016 years old. They believe
[24:52.120 --> 25:00.360]  that years go forward from that point, not the birth and death of Christ. We have videos
[25:00.360 --> 25:04.800]  4th of July where people don't know how many stars are on the American flag and they don't
[25:04.800 --> 25:13.960]  know why. And they don't know why they celebrate it. And understand something. We don't put
[25:13.960 --> 25:20.000]  these videos out with our correspondent Mark Dice at infowars.com because we want to feel
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.120]  elitist about this. Drudge doesn't link to them because of that. It's not, oh, look at
[25:24.120 --> 25:29.320]  these morons. Let's laugh at them like Jay walking and celebrating the ignorance. I don't
[25:29.320 --> 25:32.360]  even think Jay Leno was celebrating the ignorance. He was pointing out how scary. In fact, he
[25:32.360 --> 25:37.280]  said that before. It was, they were so stupid. And that's who Hillary is pitching things
[25:37.280 --> 25:44.320]  to, saying don't be racist, vote for me. You have any idea how racist Hillary Clinton is
[25:44.320 --> 25:50.040]  against the human race? She's a psychopath. That means you're the opposite of a philanthropist.
[25:50.040 --> 25:58.920]  A philanthropist in its base term means a fan of humanity. The globalist are not fans of
[25:58.920 --> 26:04.800]  humanity. And Hillary is not a fan, but she virtue signals all day long and tells you
[26:04.800 --> 26:10.360]  she's a fan. But look at her charitable records. They're almost zero. Joe Biden's Obama. Look
[26:10.360 --> 26:17.600]  at the studies from Europe, Canada, the US, Australia. Leftist are the most stingy, hateful
[26:17.600 --> 26:24.000]  people you will ever find because their criminal minds, they're mentally ill. They want to
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.440]  be in charge and they want you to think that they're virtuous like you are and that they're
[26:29.440 --> 26:36.880]  so virtuous you should be guilty and then humbly follow their orders, their bullies.
[26:36.880 --> 26:49.360]  I was talking to a doctor of psychology yesterday who got out of it because it's so corrupt.
[26:49.360 --> 26:56.480]  And he was already successful in other businesses. And he just said, no, it's totally now claiming
[26:56.480 --> 27:00.880]  someone's been a bully so you can reverse roles and be a bully against them, but feel
[27:00.880 --> 27:08.280]  good about yourself. And that's what they do. And that's why Trump being aggressive and
[27:08.280 --> 27:13.680]  confident in these criminals faces is the only way to go because we need confidence in this
[27:13.680 --> 27:19.280]  country and this world to stand up against the thugs. And if you don't know that in Europe
[27:19.280 --> 27:24.200]  and the United States and other areas, the left are a bunch of thugs. Absolutely. There's
[27:24.200 --> 27:28.520]  right wing thugs and right wing corruption because the same globalists are manipulating
[27:28.520 --> 27:34.720]  both political systems towards the same authoritarian end. It's just with the left, they're able
[27:34.720 --> 27:47.240]  to go so incredibly far because it's a cult. The constituents of the mindset just lazily
[27:47.240 --> 27:51.660]  want to feel good about themselves, decide they're the good guys and everybody else outside
[27:51.660 --> 27:58.600]  of that is the bad guys. They're the most insular, believe what they want to believe,
[27:58.600 --> 28:01.840]  ignorant group of people you can imagine. I mean, I really try to disprove my ideas.
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.920]  I really try to talk to other groups and I really try to understand things and I really
[28:05.920 --> 28:14.880]  am open minded. I'm a libertarian. I'm a real liberal and I'm very offended by the modern
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.120]  fascistic left. I really am. And I just wonder how bad it's going to get in the next administration
[28:20.120 --> 28:24.840]  because I thought Bush was bad. Boy, I thought he was bad. And then every real liberal out
[28:24.840 --> 28:30.520]  there, whether it be somebody like, again, a Jonathan Turley constitutional lawyer, whether
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.520]  it be somebody like, to Bill Pagley, I mean countless others say, oh no, you know, they
[28:35.520 --> 28:41.920]  have the Green Party. Oh yeah, Obama's three to 10 times, depending on who you hear from,
[28:41.920 --> 28:46.720]  three to 10 times worse than Bush. And they have metrics and studies showing this. You
[28:46.720 --> 28:52.040]  know, Turley said it was three times worse like five, six years ago. Three times worse.
[28:52.040 --> 28:57.420]  That's a conservative estimate. Three times worse against the press and against whistle
[28:57.420 --> 29:02.200]  blowers and against the economy and crony deals and big corporations giving money and
[29:02.200 --> 29:05.720]  then the government shuts down their competition as the country falls apart. I'm going to go
[29:05.720 --> 29:11.640]  to break. I'm going to come back and play the clip where the FBI director goes through
[29:11.640 --> 29:15.400]  all the bad things Hillary did, but said there's no evidence, play a few other clips talking
[29:15.400 --> 29:19.400]  about how her server was hacked. And then we're going to go right to your phone calls. Jerry
[29:19.400 --> 29:25.880]  Nick Brady, Robert Kenneth and many others toll free number to join us 800-25-99-231.
[29:25.880 --> 29:31.920]  By the way, people see the urgency. They understand what's going on and then they respond. It's
[29:31.920 --> 29:36.320]  a thank you for the support. Thank you for supporting yourselves. Big success with the
[29:36.320 --> 29:40.800]  July 4th mega sale on all the different preparedness items, Restorable Foods, the survival shield
[29:40.800 --> 29:46.720]  X-2, Nason I and I and the heirloom seeds, the water filtration you name it, 24% off.
[29:46.720 --> 29:51.680]  I'm extending that right through the week. The independence sale on the March, the empires
[29:51.680 --> 30:02.320]  on the run for short. Come Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. The demand for pain
[30:02.320 --> 30:08.180]  ray weapons grows over fears of civil unrest. According to a new research study, the market
[30:08.180 --> 30:13.080]  for directed energy weapons is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast
[30:13.080 --> 30:18.240]  period. Thanks for their use in controlling riots and cross border trespassing. The global
[30:18.240 --> 30:25.760]  riot control system market is estimated to grow from $9 billion in 2016 to 11.78 billion
[30:25.760 --> 30:31.800]  by 2021 as a result of increasing political disputes and civil unrest, militarization
[30:31.800 --> 30:37.280]  of law enforcement agencies, stringent environmental and governmental regulations and declining
[30:37.280 --> 30:43.080]  defense budgets of developed economies states the report. So-called pain rays or active
[30:43.080 --> 30:48.200]  denial systems work by blasting controlled microwaves into a crowd of people, creating
[30:48.200 --> 30:54.000]  an invariably hot sensation that forces them to flee the scene. You can find more reports
[30:54.000 --> 31:18.000]  on infowars.com.
[31:18.000 --> 31:23.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce
[31:23.000 --> 31:28.000]  electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.760]  unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep. And
[31:31.760 --> 31:35.640]  here's the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big

[33:27.080 --> 33:33.920]  war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[33:33.920 --> 33:42.720]  war. And nowhere in the news did they say that it was Islamic terror. Most places didn't
[33:42.720 --> 33:52.840]  even say ISIS. They report that Istanbul formerly Constantinople basically has no tourists
[33:52.840 --> 34:03.000]  there now. And no one ever says it's Islam. It's Islam on a giant jihad march worldwide.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.680]  When you look at what's happening in Europe, I've got stacks of news articles here. Mainstream
[34:07.680 --> 34:13.200]  news where they admit multi-thousand percent increases in rapes in Germany, Sweden, France
[34:13.200 --> 34:22.720]  and other areas and the police on record are ordered to cover up that it's Islamic. Almost
[34:22.720 --> 34:27.680]  all of it. Then they have Swedish ministers come out. I have an article here and say it's
[34:27.680 --> 34:36.080]  the fault of the Swedes that when the Muslims do it, it's not really a big deal. It's bad
[34:36.080 --> 34:43.480]  when Swedes do it, even though Swedes basically don't rape. Leftist politician, it's worse
[34:43.480 --> 34:48.920]  when Swedish men rape women than when migrants do. See, that's the upside down world. Oh,
[34:48.920 --> 34:53.680]  we have a multi-thousand percent rape epidemic, the capital of rape now in Europe. Oh, let's
[34:53.680 --> 34:58.840]  just blame the Swedes. Remember the Green Party came out and blamed German women and
[34:58.840 --> 35:08.520]  the mayor of Cologne blamed the German women? Well, you shouldn't look so sexy, sweetheart.
[35:08.520 --> 35:17.160]  Swedish women now, the police hand out bracelets that say in Swedish, don't touch me. You can't
[35:17.160 --> 35:26.360]  make this stuff up. And they are. Oh, in the Idaho case of the little girl that supposedly
[35:26.360 --> 35:30.400]  got sexually assaulted, the police have come out basically under orders from the city council
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.880]  and said, well, we were told to keep all this secret, but there was an assault. It was sexual,
[35:35.880 --> 35:45.760]  but it wasn't rape. And there were three teenagers involved or led by one teenager. And most
[35:45.760 --> 35:52.920]  of it's true, but the Washington Post said in full wars is discredited because we link
[35:52.920 --> 36:03.640]  to a story that basically turned out to be accurate. Idaho refugee rape. Obama, justice
[36:03.640 --> 36:07.400]  official threatens Americans who criticize migrant programs. Yeah, they're now saying
[36:07.400 --> 36:11.120]  it's hate speech to say that a lot of these folks are rapists. That's the culture. Unintended
[36:11.120 --> 36:17.440]  woman is fair game. And if a woman can be raped, then they get charged with the rape,
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.360]  not the man. This is the upside down sicko world. And they have the Washington Post
[36:22.360 --> 36:29.080]  and others over the weekend, countless articles saying that we are the that that that that
[36:29.080 --> 36:34.120]  we created the story and that we were wrong. But then when you read the article, it admits
[36:34.120 --> 36:40.000]  that we were right, but we didn't create the story. 20 girls molested in new cologne style
[36:40.000 --> 36:46.440]  attacks in Swedish rock fest. That's a new one from Friday. That's RT reporting that
[36:46.440 --> 36:53.320]  they'll probably have the Washington Post say it's my fault too. They'll just say it's
[36:53.320 --> 37:00.760]  not true when it is and then say I said it when I didn't. I'm looking at drugs Syrian
[37:00.760 --> 37:05.800]  refugee rape little girl at 9th Point, Idaho, all false. And that's the police chief. Then
[37:05.800 --> 37:12.120]  it goes into blaming drugs goes into blaming info wars because they go, Oh, they were from
[37:12.120 --> 37:24.200]  Iraq and Sudan. But that's what they call all the refugees now is Syrian. They are refugees.
[37:24.200 --> 37:29.720]  They were brought in. They were brought in by the feds. And then you call them Syrian.
[37:29.720 --> 37:34.880]  We're the ones that explain that almost none of them are Syrian. They've been letting
[37:34.880 --> 37:41.880]  less than 1% Christians in when serious 20% Christian. Now there's a new statistics
[37:41.880 --> 37:48.120]  out that will some of the newer groups 3% they're letting in because of pressure. So
[37:48.120 --> 37:52.640]  see that's how the media works. They put the lies out. We expose them. They double back
[37:52.640 --> 37:57.840]  to their own lives like a dog going to its vomit and then say that we're wrong because
[37:57.840 --> 38:09.480]  they're refugees, Muslim refugees from North Africa, Northeast Africa and Iraq. That's
[38:09.480 --> 38:15.160]  it. That's why they got jihadis of every color and shape and white, black, Asian Arab
[38:15.160 --> 38:20.080]  pouring into Syria, because it was a partially industrialized nation with a lot of farms,
[38:20.080 --> 38:24.360]  a lot of, a lot of production, a lot of good people. There's this obviously a lot of Christians
[38:24.360 --> 38:28.840]  there. So mainly a crypto nation, crypto Christian, you know, they claim is 20 something percent.
[38:28.840 --> 38:32.840]  It's more like 50% was really Christian. They've been secretly operating as Christians while
[38:32.840 --> 38:37.520]  the country's been more prosperous. Everyone's not running around killing each other for fun
[38:37.520 --> 38:43.780]  because they want to steal their property. And so now it is a burgeoning, growing country
[38:43.780 --> 38:47.280]  until this whole invasion began. And then now that the Syrians have been beating them,
[38:47.280 --> 38:50.320]  they got out the jihadis. You can't go back to their own countries. Saudi Arabia won't
[38:50.320 --> 39:00.480]  take them. Sudan won't take them. No. So they go through Turkey and Urgun and come to Europe.
[39:00.480 --> 39:05.240]  But I'm going to stop there and go to your phone calls. Vermont town debates welcome
[39:05.240 --> 39:09.760]  for 100 Syrians is Trump pushes ban. And by the way, that's Bloomberg. When you hear
[39:09.760 --> 39:13.320]  there's a hundred coming to your town, 10 times that that's been the metric in Europe
[39:13.320 --> 39:18.240]  and here I'm explaining this very, very slowly. They also claim that we claim in the Washington
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.640]  post the numbers are much higher. They did the same thing in Europe where they'd say
[39:22.640 --> 39:26.760]  it was a hundred thousand a year where it was over a million a year and Obama claims
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.160]  it's under a hundred thousand. When ladies and gentlemen, it's tens of thousands in
[39:30.160 --> 39:41.720]  Austin, Texas alone, hundreds per school this year. Over 230 in one year to the high school
[39:41.720 --> 39:46.520]  I graduated from in Northwest Hills, a smaller high school. I called other high schools.
[39:46.520 --> 39:52.520]  So did my other reporters. Every high school is jam packed with Syrian refugees. They're
[39:52.520 --> 39:58.800]  not Syrians. Most of them and most of the refugees aren't children. Most of them are
[39:58.800 --> 40:05.640]  military age men. So if my high school of something like 1500 students just added almost
[40:05.640 --> 40:11.840]  200 and two was 232. I think they just added that. Imagine how big these numbers are, ladies
[40:11.840 --> 40:17.760]  and gentlemen. I mean, the numbers are staggering. And our government, I didn't mean to digress
[40:17.760 --> 40:22.440]  into this, has got our borders wide open. We have seen terror attacks in Africa, in the
[40:22.440 --> 40:31.840]  Middle East, in Asia, in Central Asia, killing close to a thousand people since last Friday.
[40:31.840 --> 40:35.520]  And you don't hear anything except, oh, we're going to take more of your rights away and
[40:35.520 --> 40:39.320]  have more airport security and track Americans. How about you just don't bring more of these
[40:39.320 --> 40:43.880]  people in? They don't live with each other in peace. It's not like we're bringing in
[40:43.880 --> 40:52.880]  Iraqi physicists, professors. It's not like we're bringing in a Persian scientist or something
[40:52.880 --> 40:58.280]  to go to our universities or to be professors. Sure, you can bring folks over that are leaving
[40:58.280 --> 41:02.280]  that and don't want to be part of it and have denounced it. Bring the Christians, bring
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.720]  the real political dissidents, bring the Muslim heretics in who don't want to be under radical
[41:06.720 --> 41:14.720]  Islam, bring reformers in, but do not bring the foaming at the mouth loons. There's new
[41:14.720 --> 41:21.800]  video today on infohorses.com of two visually impaired people trying to get a cab and they
[41:21.800 --> 41:26.320]  won't let them in. And if you live in London, most of the cab drivers now are Muslim. And
[41:26.320 --> 41:29.440]  they work in these groups. I experienced it last time I was in England, where they wouldn't
[41:29.440 --> 41:33.720]  take us to the airport that was three miles away. And I went down the cab queue of like
[41:33.720 --> 41:37.760]  20 Muslims and none of them would take me. And then a British old guy pulls up and he
[41:37.760 --> 41:42.120]  goes, he goes, yeah, they do that. They all work together. And he can't say anything or
[41:42.120 --> 41:47.800]  they call you or you get called racist. And they were demanding 50 pounds to take me like
[41:47.800 --> 41:56.720]  three miles to the Hyatt. And we're just refusing. They said, no, we only go to London. And they
[41:56.720 --> 42:01.200]  just hated us so much. And we just, and finally, after I sat there and I even got it on video,
[42:01.200 --> 42:04.560]  I never put it out. I finally, a British guy pulls up and he goes, no, they're not supposed
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.080]  to do that. You know, it's the law. They're supposed to take you wherever you want. That's
[42:08.080 --> 42:11.680]  why they pull up here at the airport. But they gouge everybody. He goes, where are you going?
[42:11.680 --> 42:17.800]  And I said the highest three miles away and he goes, that'll be six pounds. It's like $10.
[42:17.800 --> 42:24.000]  I got in, gave the guy a tip of like 10 extra pounds. And he apologizes. An old guy out
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.240]  of London or bags out and he goes, it's kind of sad, you know, but it just gets worse.
[42:30.240 --> 42:34.120]  But I'll try to say something about it, but they sure give away a hard time. It's not
[42:34.120 --> 42:40.760]  like things used to be here in England. One old English guy, folks gave me the service
[42:40.760 --> 42:43.480]  and to grow me because that's how he wants to be treated. He don't want to be there.
[42:43.480 --> 42:48.120]  It's screwed over. But I know I'm a caffer. I know I'm an outsider. I'm a nobody. I'm
[42:48.120 --> 42:54.760]  a subhuman. I deserve to pay you 50 pounds to go three miles. What is that? Overcharge
[42:54.760 --> 43:05.800]  me 10 times. I deserve to be charged 10 times over by guys wearing fricking pajamas because
[43:05.800 --> 43:11.680]  I'm a white guy, but I saw him doing it to Asians, other people. If you weren't a Muslim,
[43:11.680 --> 43:21.440]  you were a dumb ass and they were all going to sit there and screw you over together.
[43:21.440 --> 43:24.080]  And I've talked to Joe Biggs and others that have been in heavy combat all over and they
[43:24.080 --> 43:27.720]  say the Muslims weren't like that even in Iraq and places. It's who they're bringing
[43:27.720 --> 43:33.160]  in folks. They're bringing in vetting, just like the father-in-law or the brother-in-law
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.520]  of the guy at the nightclub and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. He's running a major
[43:37.520 --> 43:42.960]  refugee operation. His dad went to the White House, all this stuff. They're bringing jihadis
[43:42.960 --> 43:47.160]  in. That's why they act like this. And I'll tell you, it is giving because I've talked
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.520]  to the experts. It's giving regular Muslims a bad name. You can argue all Islam is radical.
[43:51.520 --> 43:55.600]  The Orthodox version is like this, but this is who Hillary's bringing in. This is who
[43:55.600 --> 43:59.480]  she's allied with. This is what she's up to. And I'm going to go to your calls. I apologize.
[43:59.480 --> 44:03.760]  Let me play the filming clip because I talked about it. I already played the clip where he
[44:03.760 --> 44:07.800]  says no charges for her. We should probably play that just one more time. It's about 20
[44:07.800 --> 44:14.720]  seconds long. Then I'm going to play FBI director, gets into criminal neglect, but then turns
[44:14.720 --> 44:18.400]  around though and says no prosecutor will go after her. That is the biggest lie I've
[44:18.400 --> 44:20.360]  ever seen. Here's the no indictment clip.
[44:20.360 --> 44:25.840]  Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of
[44:25.840 --> 44:31.240]  classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such
[44:31.240 --> 44:36.920]  a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before deciding whether to bring
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.720]  charges. They're obvious considerations like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding
[44:41.720 --> 44:47.240]  intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person's actions and how
[44:47.240 --> 44:53.760]  similar situations have been handled in the past. In looking back at our investigations
[44:53.760 --> 44:59.720]  into the mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would
[44:59.720 --> 45:03.040]  support bringing criminal charges on these facts.
[45:03.040 --> 45:07.040]  Wow, that sets an incredible precedent right there. Total Declaration of Independence that
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.120]  they're above the law. Let's go to the next clip. It's about two minutes long and I'm
[45:10.120 --> 45:14.720]  going to write to Jerry and others. This is where he lays out though what she did. It's
[45:14.720 --> 45:20.000]  far worse than this, but let me tell you, this is not criminal neglect. This is conscious,
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.520]  lying to Congress, lying to the FBI, cutting the tops off the secret documents, ordering
[45:25.520 --> 45:29.520]  her staff to engage in crimes. I mean, this is ridiculous. This is like the cops flip
[45:29.520 --> 45:34.400]  the bank and the bank robbers are walking out with the bags of money in their hands
[45:34.400 --> 45:37.320]  and there's surveillance footage of them screaming saying, get on the floor, I'll kill you. I
[45:37.320 --> 45:42.800]  mean, it's open, it's shut. I tell you, it's open and shut now that these people are given
[45:42.800 --> 45:46.200]  a green light to go crazy.
[45:46.200 --> 45:50.440]  And then what do you do when you have a lawless government ruling over you? Well, you're smart
[45:50.440 --> 45:53.600]  about it. You don't let them start a civil war so that the persistence is against the
[45:53.600 --> 45:58.120]  general government itself. It's as disgusted as anybody else is, but you got to navigate
[45:58.120 --> 46:03.320]  that because why is this, what is it? Why is this a serpent and peaceful as a dove? But
[46:03.320 --> 46:08.200]  at some point, you know, this thing turns into 1776 because they're going to push it.
[46:08.200 --> 46:12.000]  They're going to offensively come for our guns. That's what kicked it all off at 1775
[46:12.000 --> 46:16.640]  Election Concord.
[46:16.640 --> 46:21.960]  That Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified
[46:21.960 --> 46:27.920]  information. There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very
[46:27.920 --> 46:34.480]  sensitive, highly classified information. For example, seven email chains concern matters
[46:34.480 --> 46:40.680]  that were classified at the top secret special access program at the time they were sent
[46:40.680 --> 46:47.320]  and received. Those chains involve Secretary Clinton both sending emails about those matters
[46:47.320 --> 46:53.000]  and receiving emails about those same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.880]  that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with
[46:57.880 --> 47:02.760]  whom she was corresponding about those matters should have known that an unclassified system
[47:02.760 --> 47:08.360]  was no place for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also
[47:08.360 --> 47:13.000]  found information that was properly classified as secret by the U.S. intelligence community
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.560]  at the time it was discussed on email. That is excluding any later upclassified emails.
[47:19.560 --> 47:24.400]  None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system. But their presence
[47:24.400 --> 47:30.520]  is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal
[47:30.520 --> 47:37.360]  servers not even supported by full time security staff like those found at agencies and departments
[47:37.360 --> 47:43.840]  of the U.S. government or even with a commercial email service like Gmail. I think it's also
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.720]  important to say something about the marking of classified information. Only a very small
[47:48.720 --> 47:54.120]  number of the emails here containing classified information bore markings that indicated the
[47:54.120 --> 47:59.440]  presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked classified in
[47:59.440 --> 48:05.760]  an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified
[48:05.760 --> 48:11.480]  are still obligated to protect it. And while not the focus of our investigation, we also
[48:11.480 --> 48:16.640]  developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general and with
[48:16.640 --> 48:22.240]  respect to the use of unclassified systems in particular was generally lacking in the
[48:22.240 --> 48:25.440]  kind of care for classified information. Let's stop right there. I'm going to go to your
[48:25.440 --> 48:31.320]  phone calls. Here's the deal. He called it a year ago. Larry Nichols, former Clinton
[48:31.320 --> 48:35.000]  insider, he said that they were having the media push the email thing because they knew
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.880]  how it went in to the end. And that would be a distraction from all the other incredible
[48:38.880 --> 48:45.640]  corruption, the missile secrets, the rapes, the Obama and Hillary and the persecution
[48:45.640 --> 48:50.440]  of Christians. But imagine with everything we've seen what they're going to do now.
[48:50.440 --> 48:55.840]  It's a big question to ask because this is truly some of the most open brazen above the
[48:55.840 --> 49:01.680]  law declaration of tyranny I've ever seen. Let's go to Jerry. Jerry from Washington.
[49:01.680 --> 49:07.720]  Here on the year. Go ahead, Jerry. Hey, thanks, Alex. I appreciate your show very much. I've
[49:07.720 --> 49:13.040]  been listening for, uh, for about five years. Um, I'm, I'm a government contractor and I've
[49:13.040 --> 49:21.160]  been working for five years and we have training that we have to do four times a year. And
[49:21.160 --> 49:27.880]  in that training list is information protection. The first thing they cover is you cannot store
[49:27.880 --> 49:35.920]  any government information on any cell phones, any other emails. Uh, you can't send it to
[49:35.920 --> 49:42.080]  your private email. You can't send it to somebody else's private email unless they, unless that
[49:42.080 --> 49:48.960]  email is a business that we're doing business with. Um, this, this is, this is a choice.
[49:48.960 --> 49:56.400]  Um, this is something you, when, when I just heard, um, the first clip you played and the
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.560]  second clip you played and they're talking about whether it's confidential, whether it's
[50:01.560 --> 50:07.640]  classified information, whatever it is, that's a bunch of bull. Okay. Because you have to
[50:07.640 --> 50:14.320]  save every bit of government information. Sure. It's all compartmentalized, sometimes
[50:14.320 --> 50:19.880]  not even wired into the internet as it gets more classified. And the fact is she met Lynch
[50:19.880 --> 50:23.880]  met with Clinton knowing it was illegal last week. That's what I'm saying. They're doing
[50:23.880 --> 50:29.040]  this all on purpose to just set the precedent that they're above the law. That's, that's
[50:29.040 --> 50:33.800]  exactly what I'm saying. This is a choice because she knew better. She has to take that
[50:33.800 --> 50:39.440]  training. Everybody has to take that training. And the thing of it is, is she knew you can't
[50:39.440 --> 50:43.040]  delete even what you can't, the only kind of email you can delete is if somebody says
[50:43.040 --> 50:46.960]  they're having a retirement party, something like that. That's the only kind of email you
[50:46.960 --> 50:52.520]  can delete. You can't, you cannot, you have to store all, all government business documents
[50:52.520 --> 50:57.000]  on their server. Absolutely. And then she knew it was compromised by foreign governments.
[50:57.000 --> 51:02.440]  It's espionage, folks. Thank you, Jerry. Are you prepared to bug out infidel body armor

[54:26.800 --> 54:33.200]  For 13 hours, plus, they sit there and watch the stand-down take place. For 8 hours, they
[54:33.200 --> 54:38.720]  watch the firefight go on. Everybody who is in the military and understands how that works
[54:38.720 --> 54:42.880]  or the thousands that saw it on the Predator Drone feeds or the thousands that have since
[54:42.880 --> 54:47.600]  seen the recordings of those feeds know there was a stand-down. We have the witnesses who
[54:47.600 --> 54:53.440]  will receive the stand-down, so we know they're lying, just like we know about the servers.
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.880]  She first said she didn't have separate servers and didn't have separate emails. Remember
[54:57.880 --> 55:02.080]  the head of the Environmental Protection Agency had to resign a few years ago because she
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.400]  had secret emails? They operate outside of government oversight and citizen oversight
[55:07.400 --> 55:11.880]  with these systems. But with Hillary, it goes far further. She knew foreign governments
[55:11.880 --> 55:18.840]  had penetrated. She knew they were getting that data. Now, unless it was some super-secret
[55:18.840 --> 55:24.840]  program to feed them disinfo or something, like the enigma machines or whatever, we know
[55:24.840 --> 55:30.440]  it is espionage. But the fact that they've brought all this out in front of everyone
[55:30.440 --> 55:35.240]  just shows it's just what Larry Nichols said. It's meant to break our will. It's not breaking
[55:35.240 --> 55:40.280]  my will. I'm going to Robert, Tennessee, and others here in a moment. I'm not going to
[55:40.280 --> 55:47.040]  belabor this, but we are extending the July 4th Independence Day specials. We are extending
[55:47.040 --> 55:52.320]  those right through this week because folks have really been taking advantage of it. 20
[55:52.320 --> 55:58.120]  to 40% off all of the super-high-quality, durable foods and M4select.com or M4store.com.
[55:58.120 --> 56:04.120]  20% off all of the water filters, 20% off all of the air filters, 20% off survival
[56:04.120 --> 56:10.840]  shield, NASA 99X2. We are extending this. And folks, it's now time to get prepared. It's
[56:10.840 --> 56:15.120]  now time to get ready with all the global upheaval, you name it, the globalist or instituting
[56:15.120 --> 56:19.960]  economic situations. They're instituting wars. They want to make us dependent on them. It
[56:19.960 --> 56:24.720]  is a no-brainer that we all get prepared and we all get ready. We're going to fly Hillary
[56:24.720 --> 56:31.720]  for Prison banners over the RNC and the DNC. And the purchase of Hillary for Prison t-shirts
[56:31.720 --> 56:37.600]  is what helps fund that. And regardless of whether she gets indicted in a federal court,
[56:37.600 --> 56:42.160]  we have indicted her in the court of public opinion, and we are convicting her in this
[56:42.160 --> 56:48.960]  campaign. We must defeat Hillary Clinton. A vote for justice, a vote for people not
[56:48.960 --> 56:54.040]  being above the law. My gosh, we got to get Donald Trump in there. My gosh, Hillary is
[56:54.040 --> 56:58.720]  a crime boss. Imagine what she'll do if we don't kick her out. And they're going to
[56:58.720 --> 57:02.520]  engage in election fraud, but it's hard to beat a landslide. She's already stolen it
[57:02.520 --> 57:07.240]  from Bernie Sanders. This is such a rigged system, just as Donald Trump says. Robert
[57:07.240 --> 57:12.920]  in Tennessee. Thanks for holding. What's your take on this? Hey, how are you doing? Good,
[57:12.920 --> 57:17.920]  my friend. Go ahead. Good. All right. First of all, I just want to say I'm a big fan.
[57:17.920 --> 57:24.320]  You've woken up myself, my family, friends. And it's really amazing what you guys over
[57:24.320 --> 57:29.720]  it, you and your crew do. We do have an amazing crew. We do have an amazing crew. In fact,
[57:29.720 --> 57:35.320]  I just this weekend got my Hillary for prison shirt in the mail. So thank you. I'm looking
[57:35.320 --> 57:43.000]  forward to promoting freedom this upcoming election season. But I just had a quick point
[57:43.000 --> 57:50.000]  and they had a question I wanted to ask you. I just literally read the news about Hillary
[57:50.000 --> 57:58.240]  not being charged for what she's been currently been involved in just minutes before you went
[57:58.240 --> 58:05.400]  on air. And I kind of got a sick feeling in my stomach because it just goes to show how
[58:05.400 --> 58:11.120]  corrupt our government really is. I did, too. I did, too. I got nauseous. I was in a good
[58:11.120 --> 58:14.880]  mood this morning and I saw that I'm just in a terrible mood now. But I'm going to let
[58:14.880 --> 58:19.680]  her break my will. She's over the top. She's arrogant. Look how freaked out. Comey looked.
[58:19.680 --> 58:25.320]  He looked like a fox caught with a big old, big old rabbit in his mouth, you know, in
[58:25.320 --> 58:29.960]  the rabbit coop or the chicken coop. I mean, he looked like he was freaked out. Look, this
[58:29.960 --> 58:33.960]  isn't good for these crooks. We've reached that moment where the crooks can't help themselves
[58:33.960 --> 58:37.600]  and they're uncloking themselves. It's going to get rough, but there's light at the end
[58:37.600 --> 58:41.480]  of the tunnel. Good to hear from you, Robert. Sorry to hear you felt sick about that. That's
[58:41.480 --> 58:48.720]  a normal response. So Kenneth, Vincent, Nick, Brady, stay with us.

[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:09.400]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:37.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.120]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen. Wow, I just came screeching into the chair here,
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.240]  working on news during that break. I forgot that was a 72nd break, not a 3 minute one.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.040]  I'm like running back in here. We've got a bunch of big guests coming up here today.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:55.960]  Obviously, we're going to have a panel discussion with Lee and Macadoo. And of course, David
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.640]  Knight and Jacari Jackson at the bottom of the show are Dr. Jerome Corsi, pop star of
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.480]  the next segment. He's got a new book out. We're also going to be talking about this
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:08.740]  and non indictment and more. Roger Stone has got big news on the Clintons being Chinese
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:14.040]  communist agents and Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour of Overdrive from her Britannic
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:21.760]  Majesties England. So that is all coming up today. Before I go any further, we are going
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.640]  to be taking your phone calls, by the way, interspersed throughout the broadcast. All
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.360]  I'm asking you is like Lembaugh used to say, I understand your listeners are supporting
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.800]  us. We love you. We appreciate you. We thank you. We couldn't do any of this without you.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.880]  But when I go to your calls, I really want to hear what you think about what happened
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.680]  with Hillary and the indictment and where you think this country is going because it
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.240]  gets a little obscene when we take call after call telling me how great I am. You're great.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:55.160]  You're awesome. Okay. But listen, I love everybody that loves freedom as well. We're in this
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.280]  together. I think we're going to win it, but we've got to stay focused on fighting the
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:05.920]  globalist. Kenneth in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead, Alex. Yes, sir. Yes. Oh,
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:12.080]  I'm, I'm just so disgusted with Hillary. Um, you know, just saying this, a blatant corruption
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.080]  it proves as a millennial to me that everything that you were saying is, I mean, it's true.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:22.680]  It gives credibility. And it's just, uh, I have no, I have no words. I mean, you know,
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:28.120]  what happens if she gets in, we're done. I mean, we're, we're finished as a country,
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.120]  in my opinion.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.880]  Well, when you look at how ignorant the average voter is, at least half of them, that's why
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.160]  these, these tyrants are so emboldened, uh, is we're looking at just incredibly dumbed
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:44.680]  down stupid people who, as long as they're pandered to verbally, they're not really supported.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.320]  As long as the establishment panders to them and packs them on the head, they'll jump
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.720]  off a cliff. Right. And, uh, you know, it's unreal, you know, and we'll see, I guess in
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:59.880]  the, uh, you know, at the elections, if, uh, how this will all play out, but we, we need
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.720]  Trump, we need Trump desperately, um, you know, imagine what Hillary's going to do if
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.800]  she gets in. I mean, she's going to go for broke. This will be like nothing we've ever
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.800]  seen.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.480]  I worse, worse than Obama, worse than the Bush is the, you know, Bush crime family, everything
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:19.480]  you've talked about. I mean, it all comes down to this, the technocrats, all the automation
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.960]  coming in, everything, the fluoride. I mean, everything is going to be ending up with her.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.720]  I do see that, uh, she gets in.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.920]  Good points, Kenneth. Thank you for the call. Nick in the great state of Illinois. Nick,
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.920]  you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.240]  Yes, sir. Thank you. I, uh, pray for you and pray for Trump every day.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.240]  Thank you.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:45.440]  Um, it's almost as if they're pushing for, uh, citizens arrest for her cause no one
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:50.000]  else is stepping up to the point, play to, uh, you know, be a leader and make something
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.600]  happen and, and, and diter. And, uh, and I just wish that, uh, Trump would give, uh,
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.360]  Ron Paul or Jesse Ventura called to be on his, uh, VP list.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:06.840]  Well, you know, Ventura would obviously want to do that. Paul is, I guess being a purist,
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.280]  um, you know, when it comes to Trump, but Trump is a nationalist. He's an anti-globalist.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.480]  Uh, he has really, uh, I've gone from holding my nose, supporting him a year ago to really
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.800]  being proud of the fact I supported him because despite some of Trump's problems, uh, he's
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:29.000]  for real. He's got a lot of courage and, uh, he is just a great manifestation of, of America's,
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.080]  probably America's last chance. And you know, he killed, we've killed hundreds of millions
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:37.680]  of babies and we've been so corrupt and evil so long. Maybe we're just supposed to totally
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.720]  fall and collapse and, you know, the country's just supposed to burn. I mean, maybe that's
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.800]  what the socialists want and that's what they want. That's what they get. I mean, but it,
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:52.640]  it, it, it really is up to us to decide that. But I hear your brother, great point, Nick.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.880]  I appreciate your call. More calls from Brady, Denise, Vincent, Bill and others straight
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:03.840]  ahead on our show. Let's face it. Most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones,
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:08.800]  but recent studies link cell phone news to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:13.360]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful. Doctors say the infant
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.960]  brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable. So keep the phone away from your
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:22.880]  abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy. And for men, using a cell phone for as little
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:28.360]  as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm. Lowering sperm count levels so much
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.280]  that conceiving a child could be difficult. This is one of those times you want to keep
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.280]  it out of your pants. And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.680]  the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms. This causes insomnia and slow
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:45.280]  to metabolism. Hello, weight gain. Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.880]  constantly emitting radio frequency radiation. So keep your phone in airplane mode when you
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:54.160]  can. Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body. Use headphones. And when
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.960]  you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible. Leigh Ann McAdoo with
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.360]  your InfoWars tip of the week. Hey, everyone. Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright

[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:20.400]  heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.000]  dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.720]  a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy

[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:23.040]  Well his book came out a few weeks ago with the headline partners in crime. And I tell
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:28.320]  you, this multi-time number one New York Times bestselling author couldn't have been
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:35.800]  more dead on, WorldNet Daily Books. Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's worked in anti-terrorism and
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:41.800]  clandestine consulting operations, who's been involved in international banking as multiple
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:47.120]  degrees. Of course, top of his class there at Harvard. Good long-term friends for 40
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.360]  years with Donald Trump. So I couldn't think of someone better, in the next 25 minutes
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.680]  we have with him, to cover the waterfront. Because we have just seen the FBI director
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:06.200]  about an hour and 30 minutes ago conclude a press conference where he said no indictment.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.960]  He will not recommend an indictment. And Lance said that she would go with his recommendation
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.960]  if she agreed with it. Basically, that was the proviso we played on Friday. She said,
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:18.040]  well, she wouldn't recuse her solving case she disagreed with it, but she'd have to review
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:25.160]  it. So Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us to talk about that, to talk about Trump and where
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:32.800]  all this is going. I have to be honest with the audience, okay? I have never had a more
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:38.520]  disgusting feeling of dread in my stomach. I actually feel like someone's choking me
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.240]  right now. And of course, we've all been at the hospital when family members are dying
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.040]  or we've been at funerals. I mean, I've been in big car wrecks and things. I'm not saying
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.280]  I'm Mr. Tough Guy, but I've been through some bad experiences. And I guess to kind of analyze
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.560]  my own psychological perspective, I've been dealing with the Clintons for 20 plus years.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.760]  I know how evil they are. And it really is disheartening to realize that they're about
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.120]  to get even more power and are getting more corrupt as they go along and have promised
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.080]  to come after the Liberty Movement and the Patriots. And she's starting all these wars
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.480]  and she's working with Al Qaeda and ISIS and they've been persecuting Christians and conservatives
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:18.360]  and veterans and people. I mean, to come to grips with the fact that she looks three or
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:23.920]  four times crazier than she did in the nineties. And the way she acts and bragging about killing
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:30.520]  people and lying about, you know, Brian Williams stories about how she's in combat. I mean,
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:37.840]  there's just not just a feeling. There is a total intellectual understanding, bodily
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:45.440]  at a cellular level of getting ready for a physical fight. I mean, I physically, physically
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.720]  feel like I'm in the parking lot and a guy just pulled a gun on me. You know, that's
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.240]  happened before back when I was growing up in Dallas. I mean, I have that same feeling
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:11:00.240]  of disgust and dread and not fear. It's more like get ready. Now I want to go to Dr. Corsi
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:06.160]  to discuss this and more her communist Chinese connections, all of it is incredible. I want
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.640]  to ask Dr. Corsi out of the gates, what his view of this, where this is going. And, and
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:16.600]  of course his book, Perfectly Time with the proper name and the research of these partners
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.840]  in crime, Bill and Hillary, what they're planning to do because I have a gut feeling
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:26.960]  and intellectual understanding that they are going to get their total wish list now and
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:32.080]  go for broke. Is that an accurate statement, Dr. Corsi?
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.920]  I agree with the entirely. I mean, I think the, what we see today is that the fix is
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:45.080]  in. I mean, clearly you've got the FBI, you know, listen carefully to Comey's statement.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:51.680]  He basically said Hillary committed a number of crimes that she's guilty of criminal negligence
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.000]  and yet she's going to escape. She's not going to get indicted for things that normally
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.280]  people like Petraeus and others would have have been prosecuted for. You know, double
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:08.240]  standard of law. And now Hillary Clinton has clearly tainted goods. It's obvious she lied
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:14.320]  that she had classified emails that were transmitted over her server that she knew about and should
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.040]  have known about, but yet she's not going to be prosecuted. Now, this again is a double
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:25.480]  standard. And by the way, Alex, the whole thing looks like a setup. I mean, you have
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:32.960]  Bill Clinton on the tarmac, wink, wink, the Loretta Lynch, then CNN starts, you know,
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.960]  tweeting that they have inside sources. There's going to be no prosecution. Hillary comes
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:45.440]  in over the holiday and testifies or gives an interview with the FBI. And then here we
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:53.440]  are immediately after Comey saying no prosecution. Hillary shows up in North Carolina, flying
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:59.840]  on Air Force One with Barack Obama. The whole thing, look, is orchestrated as when Candy
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:06.000]  Crowley pulled out, you know, the speech that Obama gave after Benghazi during the debate
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.640]  with Romney. It looks completely choreographed and wink, wink, even Loretta Lynch saying,
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.800]  I'll just accept the recommendation of the FBI. Sure. She already knew the FBI wasn't
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.600]  going to prosecute. Of course she'd accept her.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.200]  Let me ask you this. I mean, you've been a political insider for a long time. You almost
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.480]  always call it like it is almost like 99% of the time. What is the point of rubbing our
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.880]  faces in it? What is the point of acting so incredibly arrogant and Hillary kind of letting
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:37.000]  them have that let them eat cake moment, it seems? Or is this just megalomania? Is this
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.440]  just people that have decided as a political class they have Republican establishment cover?
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:47.360]  They're going to go for broke. Yeah, I mean, the Clinton's attitude like it was, it has
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.680]  been in Europe with the EU is, you know, the United States would be a good country except
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:56.680]  for the voters. We'd be just fine if the voters could be ignored. The voters are stupid. They
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.720]  don't know what they're doing. So the elites, the Clintons were above the law get to determine
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:08.280]  how they make vast riches, you know, billions of dollars out of the Clinton Foundation,
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:13.560]  something we would go to jail for doing, how she can violate national security laws with
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:19.360]  their emails, which even the FBI admits is negligent, reckless. You know, how are we
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.560]  going to elect a reckless, negligent, incompetent person who can't run a blackberry to be president
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.320]  of the United States? But of course, that's all supposed to be washed away because we've
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.200]  got a photo op and Air Force One with Barack Obama and Hillary, they're going to hold hands
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:39.440]  and do kissy face and tell the people we need to have Hillary for eight years. Let me ask
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.400]  you this question. She's claiming she's going to go to the center of elected. But from when
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.200]  I've seen them setting up in their preparations, it looks like the opposite from your sources
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:53.720]  in your own political grab a toss. If she gets in, what do you expect to happen? Again,
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:59.680]  my gut tells me, leave the country. Well, I mean, first, certainly you're right in terms
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.880]  of that she's going to go more to the left. There's no question about it. I mean, Hillary
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:09.840]  has had Huma Abidine advisor. She was the one who is, I think the butcher of Libya.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.160]  I think you're going to find the coming months that Hillary was the one who destabilized
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:20.520]  Libya, abused women throughout Libya, let Libya go to the al-Qaeda terrorists. This has already
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.720]  been clear from the Benghazi investigations we've had, especially the Citizens' Commission
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:32.880]  on Benghazi made it absolutely clear that Hillary threw Libya to the dogs. I think with
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.480]  the Clinton Foundation, with things that I'm proving in my book and others, you know,
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:43.680]  we've got Peter Schweitzer out there as well. Clinton's wanted the oil in Libya. They wanted
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:50.400]  to gain economically with Blumenthal. They didn't care if millions died in the process.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.480]  You're going to have a Supreme Court that's going to be so far left, it's going to be
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:59.720]  unimaginable. It's going to be an expansion of government so that we have more government
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:06.920]  control in every possible area, more climate control, fake science that's going to further
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:11.920]  destroy the United States' ability to be an industry leader, a world leader, and coal
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:17.400]  and oil. Obama's just about shut down the coal industry. Hillary will make sure it's
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.920]  killed. They need to go issue after issue. And what's going to happen is, and by the
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:28.720]  way, conservatives, anyone who disagrees with this far-leftist agenda is going to be identified
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:35.120]  as hate crime, will be put in concentration camps for thought reform. It'll be criminal
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:41.440]  to do things like be a climate denier. Meanwhile, Israel is going to be abandoned, thrown to
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.720]  the dogs. Iran's already been given free reign to develop nuclear weapons, and the Iranians
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.280]  are saying they've got 100,000 missiles pointed at Israel. No one's going to stand up under
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:57.480]  a Clinton administration for Israel. We're going to have deficits that are going to bankrupt
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:05.000]  average Americans, throw us into a global currency with the TPP and this transatlantic
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.040]  agreement both being ratified in a lame duck session. I think they'll ratify TPP, and then
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:16.400]  they'll push the transatlantic under agreement. We'll be into a global world economy, which
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:25.760]  is the prelude to a global government. Wow. Well, I kind of feel like we're sitting
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:29.640]  here, Dr. Corsi, just calmly presiding over the death of the Republic. There have been
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:36.680]  so many signposts, so many indicators of a political class and foreign interest being
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:43.600]  basically somewhat invincible because of the corruption at the top, but now it seems to
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.520]  be getting worse. I mean, is it accurate that it's getting worse, or do we just know more
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.520]  about it now?
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.560]  Well, I think it's a combination. I mean, you've done a great deal. We've all worked
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:18:00.200]  to expose the corruption, to expose the far left agenda for what it is, which is totalitarianism
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.720]  and elimination of the Constitution, our free speech. We have a Supreme Court that's going
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:10.360]  to be unimaginable under Hillary Clinton. You're going to find that I think like in
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:16.000]  Europe, Americans are waking up, and I think saying enough to this agenda, but this is
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:23.120]  a critical time. If Hillary Clinton manages to be president, then the Clinton Foundation
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:29.560]  is going to go into overdrive. Obama will have his own criminal foundation. Politicians
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:34.840]  in the United States will be in it for one reason, that is money, maybe money and power.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:40.280]  To see the rich get richer, the global rich, they'll be the extremely well-off, and then
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:46.800]  everybody else who can barely not buy a house or live from paycheck to paycheck, and they
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:52.880]  won't care. The global elite won't care. It'll be lie after lie after lie, a double
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:59.600]  standard of prosecution. Conservatives will be defined as politically criminals, while
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:08.320]  the Clintons making millions, ignoring laws with regards to classified information, running
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.400]  their own above the law entirely.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:15.520]  So this is a classic totalitarian takeover. If you've just joined us, Dr. Jerome Corsi
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:20.840]  of WND.com always had three or four number one New York Times bestselling books. Two
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:26.160]  of his books have openly, they say, affected the outcome of US elections. So this guy is
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:31.400]  not playing games, partners in crime, is the new book. And while he's talking, I'm being
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:38.760]  flooded with just backup articles and things that we've seen where they're openly in the
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:43.200]  Democratic Party platform. Daily Call reported last week saying they want to arrest climate
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:49.120]  change deniers. They want to now start arresting people in Canada and the US and Europe that
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.960]  say there's only two genders. I mean, this is true totalitarianism with a dumbed down
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:58.800]  mass of minions behind it. And it looks like the left, as a kind of fascist global movement
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:04.360]  with socialism as the political tool at the bottom, exempting themselves from it, are
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:09.920]  basically attempting a final takeover. So speak to that, sir, and then expand, though. How
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.520]  does the Brexit affect that, though? It seems like that's only getting them to accelerate
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.520]  their timetable.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:21.960]  Well, in fact, I think what you see today with Hillary Clinton being asked by Comey that
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:29.560]  the FBI is not going to recommend prosecution. Now you're going to see a run, a mad run to
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:35.560]  the finish line where the globalists are going to try to take over power completely so that
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.800]  they can say the Brexit vote, well, we're just going to ignore it. We're going to slow it
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.800]  down.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.800]  So they're going to try to show it up.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:44.760]  Just slow it up. We're not going to pull out right away. And then they cause a massive
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:50.920]  international crisis where out of fear, Great Britain says, oh, we better rejoin the EU.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:56.480]  We better come on back. We don't want to destroy anything. This is the setup to push the United
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:04.200]  States. And Hillary is the plan. The Bilderberger globalist plan is to do the Trans-Pacific
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:11.440]  Partnership, the Transatlantic Investment Partnership. This puts us into a global economic
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.120]  one-world order that is the prelude to what we're seeing now in the EU, where the EU is
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:21.360]  finally saying openly that they meant empire. They're going to have their own army. They're
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.440]  going to destroy the individual country's legislatures. You know, Italy is going to
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.880]  do what the EU wants it to do. That's always been the plan. It's been alive from the very
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:31.880]  beginning.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.440]  They now admit, oh, we're just going to dissolve your military and we'll have an EU military
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:43.240]  and you can't leave. Open declaration of Hitlerian invasion or communist style, you know, Soviet
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:48.760]  takeover. I mean, this is classic and they're doing it so nakedly, I guess because they're
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:53.280]  in power. And it's the same thing that will to power historically. Let me ask you this.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.880]  You mentioned the Bilderberg group. They had the professor there that invented the term
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:02.040]  the precarious. We're, oh, we've made everyone precarious to control them. Now let's put
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:06.760]  everyone on a monthly stipend so everyone's on welfare, so everyone's dependent. Well,
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:11.080]  we've always known that's the plan with welfare and clout and pivot. But as you said, they
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.080]  now came out last week and said, we are an empire. We are totalitarian. We are technocratic.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:20.240]  We will take over your military and we are going to make it where you're the money you
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.280]  get every month is controlled by us. I mean, that is a nightmare scenario, but it's coming
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:29.480]  from them. We would, you would write books. I would write articles that, you know, exposing
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.800]  these statements to say, look, this is horrible. Instead, they've got the political calculus
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:37.680]  daughters around Corsi of just throwing in our face. What's the thinking there?
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.480]  Well, I mean, again, I think they're going to run to the finish line naked. They don't
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:46.640]  care. And the things that we were, you know, branded conspiracy theorists and ridiculed
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.800]  by the globalists. Now they're publishing openly. The EU has declared it wants to be
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:56.880]  an empire. And look, this all fits together. The same day you've got Hillary's not going
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:03.520]  to be prosecuted. The FBI caves in admits she broke laws. But who cares? You've got
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:08.720]  the house going to vote the house Democrats pushing again for gun control. They're not
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:14.280]  going to give up pushing for the guns freedom by freedom here. So, you know, the elite don't
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:19.520]  have to face law the way we have to face law. Hillary, Oh, no, well, you wish he did all
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:24.520]  these things. You know, she, oh, yes, she lied. Well, there were classified documents.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:29.520]  She lied. She, you know, knew that documents were classified. They were marked actually,
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:34.960]  but that's okay. Don't worry about it because, you know, we can't prove intent. Well, of
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:40.520]  course you can prove a 10. You approved intent on Petraeus for far lesser crimes. She went
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.880]  to great pains to set up this separate email system and she did it for a reason. The reason
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:51.080]  she did it was to evade all the government scrutiny, the FOIA requests and to be able
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:57.560]  to pad her personal piggy bank with the Clinton Foundation, with all kinds of emails shared
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:02.400]  between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation where they could cash in or direct
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.920]  on her various decisions, selling State Department decision. And of course, all this is just
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.760]  going to be excused. And we're going to be told, you know, by the officials that are
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:18.600]  there that, oh, this is not a, we can't prosecute for this. You know, yes, all these crimes were
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:24.080]  committed, but we can't prosecute for this. Well, that's the totalitarianism. That's
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:28.960]  the double standard. That's the elite. She's already been crowned part of the elite. She's
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.120]  already been declared president by the Bilderberger group. Now they're just going to play the
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:39.720]  show out, the drama. You know, we have the Comey press conference and now we've got the
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:46.760]  Clinton appearance with Obama and Air Force One, which by the way, who paid for taxpayers.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:52.000]  So here we get this coming on. And now we've got Obama, you know, kissy, kissy with Hillary
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.360]  and she's going to be promoted as innocent, just pursued by the right wing while she pushes
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:04.960]  the global agenda, trade agreements, taking, you know, people don't realize that John Kerry
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:12.800]  signed the UN's gun declaration while all this was going on. The trade ambassador, U.S.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:19.520]  trade ambassador frohman declared that they were going to pass TP in the lame duck session,
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:25.560]  lame duck session when, you know, in between the election and the new Congress coming in,
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:32.520]  the elite don't give up. And this is a elite today. I think they've won a victory. Now
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.600]  where the American people vote. And if the American people start listening and waking
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:41.760]  up and understanding that, you know, Donald Trump in perfect though he may be is the only
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.760]  one who's going to call this without worrying about political correctness. That's just another
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.560]  standard. So none of us tell the truth. I agree with you. And by the way, I think they've
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:55.800]  miscalculated. I think they're rushing the finish line out of concern. And I think the
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:00.480]  fact that this isn't a regular cycle where you've got some milk toast Republican that's
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:06.080]  going to lay down his greatest attribute is he's brazen and brave. And you know him well.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.800]  He's committed to what he's doing. And so that's got to really worry Hillary when he
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:15.880]  gets into debates with her and you know, starts bringing all this up because you know, they're
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.080]  hoping to keep this from her constituents. But as more of this comes out, I expect that
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:25.840]  20, 30% that doesn't vote a big percentage to switch to Trump. So a, what do you think
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.120]  Trump should do? How do you think Hillary will strike back? And do you expect them to
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.120]  try to steal the election?
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.080]  They're going to try to steal the election. No question. They're going to do voter fraud.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:41.360]  They're going to do everything they can. Trump is the real deal. I've known Trump a long
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:47.880]  time. He is the real deal. And he is going to say these are criminals. And that they
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:52.640]  are criminals who think they're above the law. And if you allow them, they're now as demonstrated
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.280]  here with the FBI, they're going to rig the law in their favor. They're going to run the
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:03.480]  foundation to make billions for themselves, you know, sending defective drugs to AIDS
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:10.360]  victims in Africa of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from the unit aid fund
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:16.880]  through the UN, filing fraudulent financial statements for their foundations. I mean,
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.680]  this is the real crime. This is the real stealing. You know, these are two grifters, Bill and
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:27.640]  Hillary Clinton. They have a trail behind them that stinks to high heaven of criminal
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:33.160]  activity and getting away with it. You know, no, I didn't really have sex with that woman.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:38.960]  You know, I didn't really violate any laws with my emails. Well, I didn't really benefit
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.960]  myself all that much from the Clinton Foundation. All lies. And this is the beginning of the
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:49.200]  American people. Don't understand. Go with Donald Trump saying that she's crooked. The
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:55.120]  system is rigged. It's time to stop it. You know, Thomas Jefferson was right. Every now
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.680]  and then the elite just need to be thrown out. And this is a time when if the elite
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:09.040]  win now, there won't be a reversal of their control, domination and push to totalitarianism.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:14.800]  And we're not being rhetorical here. We're not, you know, engaging in rhetoric. We're
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.440]  not hyping this. This is cut and dry what we're facing. And I think people in the government
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:24.880]  corporations as the general public has to all start resisting every way they can and
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.440]  withdrawing our consent from this illegitimate federal government that has become a criminal
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:36.240]  occupied system, Dr. Corsi. I think that's, that's all we can do and start really moving
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:43.120]  towards some type of emergency plan to deal with the central government because clearly
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:48.320]  they're gearing up for civil unrest while they create an atmosphere that helps it take place
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:54.400]  while they radicalize all these leftist groups to target local government. I mean, you look
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:59.160]  at this, it looks like a communist destabilization plan. I know it's not communist, but it's
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:03.400]  offshore elites like Soros using a classical destabilization plan.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:09.000]  Well, I never thought I'd live in a country where the government had gone so far to the
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.960]  totalitarian left using the IRS politically to punish conservatives. You know, defining
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:21.240]  as criminal expression, which should be allowed under the First Amendment to, you know, be
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.360]  an objector to the whole science and climate change. And by the way, the last thing we'll
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:32.600]  do right now, gun push is going to intensify, the car our guns away. That's the, that's
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.200]  the next thing you can expect.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:39.280]  All right. Partners in crime, the book, WorldNet Daily Books, WND.com. Come back soon to talk
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.200]  about their, their next push, Dr. Corsi. Thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.320]  Thank you, Alex. Great, great pleasure to be with you. Thank you.
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.560]  Very dark times, folks. Very dark times.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:30:00.920]  Here on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:06.640]  The demand for pain ray weapons grows over fears of civil unrest. According to a new
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.680]  research study, the market for directed energy weapons is expected to grow at the highest
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:16.680]  rate during the forecast period. Thanks for their use in controlling riots and cross border
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:22.680]  trespassing. The global riot control system market is estimated to grow from $9 billion
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:30.400]  in 2016 to 11.78 billion by 2021. As a result of increasing political disputes and civil
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:35.720]  unrest, militarization of law enforcement agencies, stringent environmental and governmental
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:41.200]  regulations and declining defense budgets of developed economies, states the report.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:46.600]  So-called pain rays or active denial systems work by blasting controlled microwaves into
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:51.600]  a crowd of people, creating an unbearably hot sensation that forces them to flee the
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:31:00.520]  scene. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:04.960]  is this so good?
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:09.600]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:14.280]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:19.960]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:25.600]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:30.160]  spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:31.160]  parasites.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.400]  Tell us about that all of a sudden. There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:38.360]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:41.040]  doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:44.200]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:48.120]  just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:54.280]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.440]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work,
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:11.680]  sir, on this great product.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:18.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:26.080]  All right. We are going to go into your phone calls with Brady and Denise and Sargent, as
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:31.640]  well as Vincent, Shane, and others in the next half hour. It's a roundtable discussion.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:36.400]  We have a little bit of the next hour. Then Roger Stone is going to be joining us. We're
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.920]  going to have Jakari Jackson, David Knight, Liam McAdoo, and myself. And that's the reason
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:44.000]  we have three studios really in here that we can go live from now because we have so
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.280]  many great crew members and reporters that just like Fox News or CNN or whatever, we've
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.560]  got our desk in there. They can get ready in another room. We can cut to them with breaking
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:55.520]  news, breaking analysis. We can cut to the other newsrooms. And we're hiring a couple
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:03.240]  more reporters, camera people, and writers right now as we tweak things to be able to
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:08.520]  really try to be able to cover world events, send reporters around the country and around
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:16.040]  the planet to really give you first looks and unfiltered analysis and live feeds, whether
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:24.360]  it be the Davos meeting or Bilderberg or the Republican DNC and RNCs that are coming up.
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:28.640]  And that's why it's more important than ever that you financially support InfoWars. We
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:34.600]  have the Hillary for Prison shirts for 1995. All the profit of this next round of shirts
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:41.600]  right through to the RNC and DNC is going towards four flights a day, two days at the
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:48.200]  RNC, two days at the DNC, $35,000. It's $30,000 for the flights, $5,000 for the banners. We're
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.960]  going to have two different banners. And so these are giant banners, not just the regular
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:58.120]  size, the big, huge ones that say Hillary for Prison InfoWars.com. Because look, we're
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:02.240]  going to get justice in the court of public opinion regardless of what the compromise
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:07.560]  corrupt FBI leadership does for others. We know crimes when they're openly committed.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.840]  Also we're extending the Fourth of July independence sale right through this week, but then it
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.840]  will end because we're not allowed to do that anymore with our water filter suppliers or
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:21.800]  with the storeable food suppliers because this is the lowest you'll find anywhere, 20
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.400]  to 40% off storeable foods that are already at the lowest price anywhere powered by my
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.440]  Patriot supply. It's InfoWars Select by private labeling. We can go even lower. That is the
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:37.440]  best deal you'll find anywhere. Also, 20% off Alexa pure water filters also off their
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:42.760]  air purifiers and survival shield, nascent iodine X2. And there's also some other items
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:47.480]  on the site that are 20 to 40% off take advantage of the independence day sale. You do not want
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:53.320]  to be not self-sufficient. You do not want to be dependent on the globalist. You want
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:57.640]  to be independent and the best thing we can do is pull out of the system more and more
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:01.880]  and be self-sufficient. So whether it's non GMO heirloom seeds or the nutraceuticals
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:07.360]  at infowarslife.com, it is now time to take action and to be specific. InfoWarsstore.com
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.400]  is the umbrella site. InfoWarslife.com is the sub-site where you find the nutraceuticals.
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.440]  Just like InfoWarsselect.com takes you right to the storeable foods. It's just kind of
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.360]  like a bookmarker to the right of the sub-page. But infowarsstore.com, you can find it all
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:28.640]  right there. Or simply call toll-free 888-253-339-888-253-339. Whether it's vitamin mineral fusion
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:35.160]  or living defense or secret 12 or brain force or the joint and bone formulas or anthroplex
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:41.240]  or silver bullet or knockout sleep aid, all of these are amazing products and are of the
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.920]  highest quality. That is our guarantee to you to only produce and sell products that

[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.440]  cleanest out there. Now, shifting gears to our round table discussion and your phone
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:03.000]  calls. I detest Hillary Clinton. Not because she's a woman, but because she's a monstrous
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.960]  creature that gets hundreds of millions of dollars, 100 million alone from the Saudis
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:12.240]  who are the most oppressive people and the most anti-liberal people in the world. And
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.640]  only by being a so-called liberal can she have the cover. If Donald Trump was taking
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.800]  hundreds of millions of dollars from Gulf state dictators, where women are executed
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.400]  if they're caught having sex outside of marriage or whatever, or gay, it's just insane. And
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.840]  then to see her get all this cover and the leftists make jokes, it's sick. And then her
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.480]  crimes on all of the different things she's done, it makes my head spin. So I want to
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:42.040]  go through the response. What, what Leon McAdoo felt and saw today as a journalist when she
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:46.760]  saw this unfold, then Jacari and David Knight, and then we'll also talk to the collars. And
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.760]  then I want to ask our round table, where do you think this is going next? Because I
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:57.040]  have never in the last few years had a sense of dread building up like I do now and my
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:03.920]  guts never wrong. And now it's gone from dread to just full on. I mean, just, I just
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:09.120]  want her out of my life. It's like a bad neighbor or a bad boss or a bad employee or a bad cousin
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.840]  or a bad, you know, relative, whatever it is, you can get them out of your life. You
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:18.080]  can stop associating with them. They're called stalkers if they won't get out of your life.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:26.000]  But I, I really have a visceral bad feeling when I look at Hillary Clinton because I just,
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  it's everything that's wrong with the world. Leon McAdoo.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.520]  I agree with you. I was filled with dread, anger. She disgusts me. To me, she is like
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:41.840]  an oozing pustule, like a seeping bed soar and someone needs to flip her over. I mean,
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.240]  she's so disgusting. She's decaying. And that's what she wants to do this country. And the
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:51.200]  fact that the FBI director, the things that he said, he's just count contradicting himself
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:55.440]  saying that the Clinton and her aides were extremely careless with the way they handle
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.880]  it. Yeah, they could care less about the rule of law. She's very careful to cut the tops off.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:05.920]  Yeah. And then saying that they mishandled it. Well, why not at least charge her with
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.560]  mishandling classified information? You know, General Petraeus, the same thing happened to
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.560]  him. I mean, that's at least just a misdemeanor, but not even that. And to just say that they
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.840]  were careless with the way that they did it. Her aide admitted that they burned her daily
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.680]  schedule. Why? Who are you meeting with that you need to burn your schedule? And then the fact
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:30.160]  that they're destroying federal documents and they know that they did that. And not to mention
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.800]  the fact that she certified under penalty of perjury that she'd fully complied with the court
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:39.600]  order. She handed over all of her official emails to the State Department. But we know again and
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:46.400]  again that that is absolutely false. She used it as a drop box for clandestine espionage.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:50.880]  And then when we, this is what we found out during the Benghazi hearing, the Benghazi committee,
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:56.080]  which they said, oh, they didn't get her at all. What a waste of time. Well, so this was in October
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:02.880]  2015. Secretary Clinton could not explain why she failed to turn over 15 Libya related emails. And
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:09.760]  her response is, I was under no obligation to make any of my emails available unless I decided
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.520]  they were work related. Remember though, first she said a few years ago, she didn't even have a
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:18.000]  server or other email. Right. No, she said she only used one phone. Meanwhile, she's been
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:23.120]  photographed with multiple devices. And Kumi just says there's nothing there.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:29.280]  That's what just makes me so angry is that now the president is flying her around on Air Force
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:33.920]  One. It's just an additional slap in the face of the American millions of dollars a day. Not only
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:37.360]  are we not going to charge her with anything. She's going to get away with the crime. We're also
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:44.080]  going to fly her around on your dime because she's the exalted goddess, Hillary Clinton.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.600]  But to check this out, so this is what I mean, explain this to me. So Kumi says, to be clear,
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.480]  this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:00.160]  no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:05.360]  sanctions. But that's not what we are deciding now. So if anybody else does what Hillary Clinton
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.480]  did, they'd be in big trouble. But not Hillary Clinton. Nope, she gets flown around on Air Force
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.960]  One. It's this gimmick. It's the gimmick that she's a woman. It's just this is who they want. It's
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:21.520]  her time. It's already been decided. They asked her to step down because it was Obama's time in
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.320]  the past. Now it is her time and they'll do whatever they can. Here's my next question.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:30.400]  What it looks like. Here's my next question. We're going to Jakari. What is your intellectual,
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.360]  but also your gut level, tell you about what she'll do when she gets in?
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:41.440]  Well, I think Jerome Corsi nailed it. I mean, we've had prophets say that Obama would be the
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:46.080]  last president. I truly feel like that could possibly happen. If she becomes the president,
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.120]  she will become a dictator. So many things will happen under her and she's just going to go.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.520]  That's what Secret Service agent Byrne said on her last week. She said she wants a socialist
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.320]  dictatorship. Yeah. And all these people who over the weekend were hashtagging America was never
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:05.680]  great. You're going to get what you've asked for. Exactly. America has had a lot of problems.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.280]  We talk about it. They don't even teach US history anymore, except bad stuff. What about
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:12.960]  compared to all the other countries? Right. Because they only teach you what America did
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.800]  that was bad. Why did everybody want to come here then? Because compared to other places,
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:23.280]  it was great in many ways and its ideals helped lead the world in women's rights and in so many
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:26.880]  other issues. Now England led the world in ending slavery and then we were kind of like to the game
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:32.800]  in that. But I mean, it's just so crazy how these socialists holding up their smartphones and all
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:39.440]  this stuff bitch about everything when it's the ultra elite that are funding them to help overthrow
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:44.400]  the middle class. So there's no way out. Jakari Jackson, your take on Hillary and where all this
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:48.640]  is going. Well, just like that caller that you had on earlier in the show, I believe he said he
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.120]  was some kind of a defense contractor and he said that he's not allowed to use the government
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:57.280]  information on this personal phone or send it to a personal email and all that. And you look at the
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:01.440]  actions of Mrs. Clinton, who's doing that exact same thing. And you contrast that with
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:07.440]  Guccifer or Bradley Manning or Snowden or Assange, all these guys who get this classified
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:11.120]  information, they want to run them through the ringer. But you have Mrs. Clinton, who's very
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.280]  much aware of she's that she's not supposed to do this because your caller knows that. Of course,
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:20.160]  she has to know this, but she just gets away with it because she's Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:27.200]  That's right. Jakari, what do you think she's going to pull once she gets in? Because we've already
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:30.480]  seen what they've done so far and it seems like everything is accelerating. What do you think
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.000]  is going to happen? I think she's going to go a whole hog if she gets in there. She's going to
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.600]  try to pass everything that's been shot down, whether it's gun control or this new politically
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:44.560]  correct movement. I guess it's not new, but growing in strength, politically correct movement,
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:48.400]  she's going to do everything that she wants to do. She's going to keep telling these waffer lies,
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:53.280]  but how she dodges sniper fire like she's Neo in the matrix and all these other things that she's
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:58.880]  been doing the entirety of her career and always run into these people. She's so experienced.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:02.880]  People just hate her because she has so much experience. Well, let's look at her track record.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:08.640]  What has she actually done that was good. She lies about everything. She's covering,
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:14.800]  she calls bills, bimbos or whatever the terminology was. She talks to the Benghazi victims. She
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:18.320]  promises she's going to help them. And then when they come out and want some accountability, she
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:23.040]  calls them liars. She tells them to get over it. We had the article up just last week about the
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.720]  Benghazi widow who said, Mrs. Clinton, you said you're going to help me and now you're telling
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:30.880]  me to get over it. This is the type of action that we can expect from a president Clinton.
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:36.000]  Now going to David Knight, David, let me ask you this question.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:43.760]  What do you really think is going on here? Why is she so above the law? She looks like
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.200]  she's half dead. Clinton looks like he's going to die any minute. I mean, seriously,
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.480]  I said he was like a reanimated corpse a few years ago out of day of the dead,
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:56.160]  but he looks like he's dying like people I've seen that are a month away from dying of cancer.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:01.680]  David Knight, why are the elites so behind him? They would put us to sleep if they put somebody
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.240]  younger in or somebody who didn't have all this baggage. Is this just the arrogance of the elite
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:11.920]  or what are they planning? Yeah, Alex, she's the only dog they've got in the fight at this moment.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.440]  You know, we've had situations in the past. So you look at four years ago,
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.120]  we had Obama and we had Romney. What they wanted then was Obamacare.
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:23.040]  They were going to get it, whether they got Romney or Obama. And that's the way they like
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:28.640]  to play. They like to have two people on either side, this fake choice that they present.
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:31.920]  That's what Carol quickly said in Tragedy and Hope. He said we just had two different parties,
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:36.080]  but really they're closely tied. So we get the same agenda regardless, but Trump obsessed that.
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:40.320]  And you see that the establishment elite and both parties
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.640]  are very concerned about Trump. They want to do anything, no matter how blatant it is.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:49.040]  And Alex, as I pointed out on Sunday, this was an orchestrated cover-up.
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:52.400]  We could see this developing. And I knew, and I said it on Sunday, I said, look,
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.440]  if you had any doubts as to whether or not she's going to get indicted,
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:00.000]  look at the fact that they scheduled the FBI meeting on the Saturday around the 4th of July
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.720]  weekend. That's other than like the last Saturday before Christmas. That's the time that they could,
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:10.240]  only time they could pick where there'd be fewer people paying attention to this.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.960]  And that's precisely what they've done. If you look at it a week ago,
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:17.040]  we had the Snakes on the Plain meeting and she says, well, it was just personal information.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.240]  Look, we understand that Attorney General Lynch is a close personal friend of Bill Clinton.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:26.160]  That's why she should have recused herself even before this meeting,
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.800]  which violated every ethical standard that the American Bar Association or any other
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:35.360]  legal group would have there. She had a close personal relationship. She had a close working
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:39.200]  relationship with them. He is the one who gave her all of her big career breaks.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:43.760]  They had a close political relationship. Those are the three tests as to whether or not you
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.160]  should recuse yourself. Plus they have all three boxes. That's key. But plus they had the FBI
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.760]  order the cameras turned off. I want to go back to you, Dave and Jacari on this. But let me ask
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:56.880]  Leigh Ann this question. Why have the meeting? Why try to cover it up? Then why to try to act
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.120]  like it's no big deal once they did it? I got to tell you, it's like they did it on purpose.
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:05.360]  They know how to secretly meet. They're not gonna be on a tarmac in front of 50 reporters.
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.280]  When, when, when, when Lynch was one of the hottest interviews at the time being chased around.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:14.800]  Why are they doing this? Nichols knew them well. Put them in power. He said they want to break our
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:20.480]  will. I agree. I agree. And that's almost what that's how I feel like my will is broken. Like they
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:24.960]  put it out in your face. They even leaked conveniently that Hillary Clinton is considering
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:28.960]  keeping Loretta Lynch on as the Attorney General. If she gets elected, you know,
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:33.840]  that it's like they're just putting out this information to just show us how above the law
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:39.280]  they are and how we're powerless. They can do whatever they want. The rules don't apply to them.
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.480]  Jacari, do you think it's that or do you think we're reading more into it? I mean,
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:47.120]  I'm just, it's crazy how arrogant they are. I think they honestly feel that they are above
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:52.080]  the law. And to an extent they have proved that it's to a point now where they're just going to
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:55.520]  do anything they want because they know that nothing's going to happen to them. They're just
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:59.040]  going to come out there with the media machine, the politically correct machine. You hate Hillary
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:02.960]  because she's a woman. You don't want to see the first woman president. That's all they have. And
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:08.560]  go on what David was talking about Lynch's personal relationship as it comes to the Clintons. Okay,
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.120]  maybe they are close personal friends in real life, but if you get selected for jury duty and you
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.920]  know the, the accused, you're not going to get selected for that jury. It's just that simple.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:21.920]  Meanwhile, they have them running around investigating them and they're hanging out talking
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.320]  about supposedly golf. She offered that as an excuse. Yeah, it's not an excuse. It's a reason
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:31.120]  that she shouldn't have even been in that position as a prosecutor. If you're a judge,
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.720]  a prosecutor or a witness in a trial or in a criminal case, you don't talk to the other people
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:42.960]  outside of court or a registered, you know, police interrogation room. You do not talk to them.
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:47.920]  Yeah. No, I mean, what do we do at this point? How do we let this stand? I mean,
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:51.920]  that's what it is. They're breaking our will to let us see that we are completely powerless, but
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:56.880]  we're not powerless. How do we change this? That's a good question, David. I mean, how do you think
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.800]  we changed? I mean, I think in the court of public opinion, we, we destroy these people. We don't
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.800]  just lay down and have them break our will just like they tried to break our will with the British
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:08.240]  exit. We just go to the next level. They're never going to give up. We're never going to give up.
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:11.440]  And that's what we have to understand. This is the animating contest of liberty, David.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:15.920]  As we're talking about this morning, Alex, it is really their declaration of independence
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:21.440]  of the rule of law because as we saw last week, not only did she not recuse herself as I point
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.040]  out because of these close personal relationships, but then they did it in our face as you're pointing
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.800]  out with a declaration. Then the day that we learned about that, which is two days later,
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:32.400]  last Wednesday, they come out and say, we're not going to release any of the emails for at
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:35.920]  least 27 months. That was something the State Department wanted. And that was something the
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.080]  Department of Justice under Lynch said, we're not going to do. Then we find out they're gonna hold
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:44.640]  this meeting at the time that nobody's gonna pay attention to it. When I heard that they were
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:49.680]  having the FBI was going to have the meeting today on Hillary Clinton, I told my wife, I said,
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:54.080]  that's it. They're not going to do anything at all to her. But then when he started to talk about
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.160]  this, Alex, and he started to lay out all the details of what they had to do with their investigation,
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:02.160]  how they found 110 classified emails. And that was a felony. I said,
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:06.000]  I can't believe this sounds like he's gonna indict her. And then he does a complete one.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.160]  And again, they're telling us we don't really care. Just don't try this at home.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:16.560]  They're covering Obama. They're covering for Obama. He won't even have to do a Nixonian pardon.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:20.480]  Yeah, yeah, they're not even have to do a pardon because they're just gonna have the
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:25.920]  bureaucracy pardons. You know, this is really almost a coup of the bureaucracy. This means if
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.000]  you can get in as the Attorney General or the head of the FBI, you run the country pretty much.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:34.400]  This is way beyond Jagger Hoover at this point. Stay there guys. I'm gonna go right to the calls
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:39.600]  here. Brady, Sergeant Shane Vincent Denise, your call straight ahead, your comments.

[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:52.880]  you heard, of course, the earlier he says that they're gonna criminally

[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:05.360]  serious. Is the recession really over? Is a bigger one on the way? Will our next president lead us

[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:08.960]  I started taking Andro 400 to increase my testosterone. Since then, I've lost 35 pounds of
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:15.280]  fat. My waist went from size 38 to size 32. I have more energy and I look and feel 20 years
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:21.280]  younger. And now my wife tells me I have to take Andro 400. Hi, this is Ron Johnson from Utah.
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:26.960]  After 10 weeks of taking Andro 400, I lost 13 pounds and my waist went from 36 to 33.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:32.880]  That was eight years ago. I continue to take Andro 400 and I've maintained my weight at 172,
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.840]  gained muscle and energy. I'm 63 now and feel better than I have in 30 years.

[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:24.160]  Up next, we're doing a roundtable discussion here a little bit in the next hour.
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:28.640]  Then Roger Stone joins us with a lot of breaking news, the Clinton crime family,
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:34.320]  and on the attempts to ban pro-Trump rallies at the RNC, but they're going to let the Democrats
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:39.600]  operate. This just shows the fix is in, but don't let them oppress you as a political group. Don't
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:46.480]  let them silence you. They're able to intimidate us and shut us up. Then we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:51.600]  This is a fight. Brady in Virginia, thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:59.440]  Hi guys. I'll basically share the same frustration from the FBI's comments this morning,
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.720]  but I also had a thought going forward. I'm wondering, even after the liberal media and the
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:13.920]  Democrats have criticized the Bill Clinton Loretta Lynch meeting, do you think Bernie Sanders will
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:20.560]  still sell out and endorse Hillary? Absolutely. He's a socialist. He wants to gut this country.
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.120]  He hates it. He wants to see it brought down so him and his little commasards can divvy up the money
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:30.080]  and sit there in their duchies. That's how this always works. These are predators. I believe he
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.240]  is a predator. He says a lot of stuff that sounds good on the surface, but he's a hardcore predator.
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:36.800]  When it comes time to him to really go out to the Federal Reserve stuff, he doesn't.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:42.160]  That's my view on Sanders. What do you think, Jacari? What do you think, David?
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:47.120]  Well, I agree with what you said right there. When you have a guy like Bernie Sanders, of course,
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:52.000]  he's not exactly happy as to what happened between him and Clinton in the primaries. But
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.680]  at the end of the day, he's going to support that party because it's the closest thing to the
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:00.640]  socialist utopia that he'd like to see happen. Right. Yeah. I think he was waiting in the wings,
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.720]  Alex, to see if they're going to indict Hillary Clinton and if that was going to change things
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.720]  to the Democrat Party. But I don't think you ever had a chance. The Democrat leadership would not
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.800]  have given this to him. I think they would have put in Joe Biden. I think they're that corrupt.
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:16.560]  It's a Politburo cult. They're the central committee. And now they admit that they just
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.920]  appoint who the nominees are and Trump's not playing along. So the fix is in.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:23.600]  That's right. And you talk about what's going to happen next. We understand what's going to
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:28.000]  happen next because we've seen what they have done coming after whistleblowers. Look at the case of
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.480]  Thomas Drake, for example, again, saying that he had classified emails on his computer, which he
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:36.240]  didn't. But they tried to put him away for 35 years. And we'll talk about that in detail
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:43.760]  later today. But in the fourth hour, by the way, they swat teamed. They swat teamed Benning.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:47.520]  That's right. I mean, this is Leigh Ann. That's right. They trumped up charges against these
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:51.200]  people when they hadn't done anything. That's what Hillary Clinton will do, whatever she wants.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.120]  But she will punish her enemies just as we've seen them try to punish these NSA whistleblowers.
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:58.640]  That's right. Leigh Ann McAdoo, when you were around Austin, and I'm guessing you talked to some
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:01.360]  so-called liberals, I've been thinking you was like a real liberal libertarian.
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:05.200]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you know, we're pretty much politically on the same page as
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:08.800]  Common Sense Freedom. When you're talking to liberals, I mean, I know some of them are supporting
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:13.280]  Hillary. I don't find many, which really shows what a hoax this is. Why are they supporting her?
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:19.920]  Or can you even find anybody? Well, I try very hard to not be around people who support Hillary
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:26.080]  Clinton. But if I do happen to run into that one odd fellow or female out there, I just,
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:32.720]  how do you gaslight yourself? How do you sit there and say that her crimes are excusable,
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:37.360]  that she could actually be the next president of the United States of America just because
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:41.920]  she's a woman? She, I mean, that's- As a woman, do you want the first woman president to be that
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:46.480]  lady? I would not- We deserve better. As a woman, I deserve better. I deserve a better
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:53.200]  representative to be the first female president. What are, are the lefts just like Venezuela
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:57.920]  in places so dumb when everything collapses? They'll, in five, 10 years, they won't, or even
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:00.800]  soon, they won't even know why it happened. They'll just call for more socialism.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:04.560]  Well, and that's what it is. It's like they're dumbing us down and they're just breaking our
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:08.720]  will to the point where people are just bending and they're saying, well, she's totally corrupt
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:12.880]  and she's proven that she's above the law. They've, they come right out and say, if anyone else does
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.800]  it, they're going to go to jail, but she's fine. Caller, do you anything else you want to add?
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:21.680]  Caller's gone. I'm going to go right back and he's been holding the longest after that. Vincent,
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:28.720]  then Denise Sargent and others, Jacari Jackson and David Knight riding shotgun with us a bit more

[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:19.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:52.720]  I'll tell you what, I am so speechless at the corruption and criminal activity that's going
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:01:01.520]  on by the government and so many times you talk about, you know, it's like Twilight Zone.
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:09.440]  These people are doing stuff right in people's faces and it's like the majority of the country is so
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:19.760]  brainwashed. It's like right in your face, they don't care and people act like it's just normal.
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:22.960]  Well, that's what I'm getting from the listeners is the same thing, just flabbergasted.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.840]  We know she lied and said she didn't have the server, didn't have the email, had one device.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:32.160]  We know she ordered them to cut the classified tops off. We know everybody's saying she should be
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:36.080]  indicted and it's just, then you ask, what else is she going to get away with? Good,
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:39.120]  good. Same, same point everybody's making, Vincent. I appreciate your calling. Anything else?
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.840]  Yeah, yeah, just, you know, you know, if you call me basically just said, yeah,
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:52.160]  like David Knight said, the political elite has given their declaration of independence from the
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:59.680]  law. They don't have to obey it. We do. And a quick thing on the gun grab, you know how the
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.400]  California governor, he signed all those gun laws. They're stripping the gun from the state of
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:10.240]  California to become the communist state. And then on top of that, to show how much they don't
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:16.400]  have to obey a law, but the California Senate votes 28 to eight to exempt themselves from the law.
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.040]  I forgot that. I saw that last week. Wow. That's what I mean. It's like literal,
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:26.000]  they are tax exempt like in the EU. They can have guns. Nobody else can. It's new royalty.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.200]  Jacarie, I think, thank you so much, Vincent. Jacarie, I think it comes down to this. This
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:35.680]  is not just declaration of independence against the law. It's a, it's a political revolution
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:39.120]  of the new royalty. I mean, I think that's what this is. I think it's what we call this
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.080]  final comments from Jacarie and David Knight. Well, they are acting as if they're a royal,
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:47.840]  you know, because they want a separate, as the caller was saying right there, they want a separate
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:52.080]  set of rules for themselves and the little people, you know, they have, they go to these buildings
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:55.520]  and I want everybody to understand when you see these, these senators, these congressmen,
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:59.440]  these presidents, even your local city council saying we want to ban guns, we want to get rid
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:04.320]  of guns. They work in a building nine to five with taxpayer funded armed security. I'm sure
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:08.160]  they feel very safe when they go to work in the morning. I'm talking about where everybody else
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:11.600]  in the country, if you work the graveyard shift at a bad part of town, you may need a little
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:15.920]  something, something to protect yourself. Well, that's what makes the country so great is the
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:19.440]  fact that we are given the right to defend ourselves and our family. One of the only
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.160]  countries they haven't taken the right, David. As the laws become more draconian, Alex, on us,
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:29.840]  on the individual citizens as they become more unconstitutional, they give more immunity to
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:35.840]  themselves. Think about the fact that we had Nixon and Clinton impeached, okay? Both of these were,
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:39.840]  people would say they're relatively minor charges, Nixon obstructed justice and Clinton
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:43.760]  committed perjury, okay? That's what they were impeached for. That was a pattern back then.
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:49.760]  Now they're saying, don't touch me. And of course, under Clinton, you had the CIA director, John
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:54.480]  Deutsch, who did essentially the same thing. And he was not only indicted, but convicted,
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:58.480]  and then pardoned by Bill Clinton. Let's go further and know what was going on with us.
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:02.800]  Final question, 20 seconds from each. Now they're above the law. What's the next
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:09.200]  shoot to drop? I agree that they're going to come after their political enemies. They've
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:14.560]  already been doing that. We've seen how they focus. And no one is going to be exempt from this. And
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:20.560]  even the leftist media is now going, whoa, wait a minute. What have we done? Hillary's a monster.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:24.800]  Everyone's protecting her. And they're, I mean, they're complicit in this.
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:30.240]  Where are people's instincts? David Jakart. Well, you know, Alex, Thomas Drake, who I interviewed
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:35.680]  once, he said in 2010, he said, why didn't realize at the time was that he was the opening shot in
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:40.480]  the Obama administration's war on whistleblowers. He said they were way beyond what Bush did. Bush
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.560]  merely threatened, he said. That's right. That's right. That's right. He actually came after
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.360]  that. What's the next shoot to drop? What's the next shoot to drop? The censorship of the media,
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:48.560]  censorship of the media that, well, they don't really need it because they have enough of the
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:52.320]  media in their pocket. But for everybody else, infowars.com, other ones out there, I'm pretty
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:56.640]  sure they'll come after us pretty hard. That's right. That's right, folks. We'll be back. Great
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:02.080]  job, Cruz. Stay with us. More callers. We'll get back to you. Let's face it. Most of us are totally
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:06.880]  addicted to our cell phones, but recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues,
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:12.000]  including brain cancer. Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.200]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable. So keep the phone
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:22.400]  away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy. And for men, using a cell phone for
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:28.080]  as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm, lowering sperm count levels so much
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:32.640]  that conceiving a child could be difficult. This is one of those times you want to keep it out of
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:36.880]  your pants. And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:41.520]  is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms. This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:46.720]  Hello, weight gain. Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:51.520]  frequency radiation. So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can. Keep the phone at least two
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:55.920]  feet away from your body. Use headphones. And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away
[02:05:55.920 --> 02:06:00.960]  from you as possible. Leigh Ann McAdoo with your InfoWars tip of the week. A clean, toxic-free

[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:09.680]  You worked, I guess, like 20-plus hours. Tell us what brain force did. I've been working all day.
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:15.440]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down.
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:18.800]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it, and I really wanted to do a good job on
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:22.960]  the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them, and about 20
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:27.920]  minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up. Got four and a half stars.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:31.440]  People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party,

[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:40.480]  based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled it all night or like that in a
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:44.800]  while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6.45 this
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:50.000]  morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in. You will find

[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:16.880]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas,
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:25.200]  it's Alex Jones. Yep, from the former United States of America in occupied FEMA region 6,
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:30.640]  formerly, formerly Texas. I think it's really true. We're under world government. It's all
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:34.800]  being announced. The Brexit has come out, and they've said, look, we don't care if England
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:38.880]  leaves or is going to keep you in there, and we're going to dissolve nation armies and merge all
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:44.160]  the countries now so you can't ever escape. And we are totalitarian. We are authoritarian.
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:48.400]  We're actually saying that. That's in the news. We've written articles about it. We've covered
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:54.160]  it the last week. It's just amazing. But see, tyrants always get delusional when the people
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:59.280]  start to say no and try to double and triple down. And I think the FBI director is saying,
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:03.760]  Hillary's above the law now, coming out saying we can't indict her. There's not enough evidence.
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:08.000]  No one would indict her when there's dozens of reasons to indict her, lying, being caught lying,
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:13.200]  classified information, ordering the tops of the classified stuff cut off. This really is the
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:19.440]  demarcation line. I mean, I'm a hundred percent in for Trump now. I halfway held my nose about a
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:22.960]  year ago knowing he was a patriot and a good guy but disagreeing with some of the stuff he did.
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:27.280]  Well, now he's a nationalist. He's got incredible courage. He's gone all out. They're coming after
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:32.800]  him with the controlled media. He's not getting any big establishment money, just more of an
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:40.400]  endorsement. I'm a hundred percent now behind Donald Trump. I'm all in. And this is an epic
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:46.560]  moment, folks, where it never in modern American history, really, in 240 years, we celebrated
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:53.600]  our birthday yesterday, have I seen anything this naked? My head is spinning. My resolve is
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:57.360]  stronger than ever. It's the best of times, worst of times. People are waking up. Good things are
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:01.760]  happening. A big announcement here. Cleveland just backed off for the second time and said,
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:06.800]  okay, you can have your rallies. You can have your pro-Trump events that I and Roger Stone and
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:12.560]  Jay Morgan and Diamonds and Silk and Ralph King and so many others are going to be speaking at
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:18.400]  United Women for Trump, Millennials for Trump, Students for Trump, Truckers for Trump, Tea Partiers
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:22.960]  for Trump, Bikers for Trump, Vets for Trump, Info Wars. We will walk Christians for Trump,
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.160]  Conservatives for Trump, Students from Trump. I mean, I just can't go through it all here.
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:33.040]  And that's up on infowars.com. That's from Citizens for Trump and America First Unity
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:37.760]  rally coming up. I'm going to be there in Cleveland. It's going to be epic. We've got the big article
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:43.200]  on infowars.com exclusive, Bill Clinton and the selling of U.S. security, the Communist Chinese,
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:49.920]  the Russians and others. But are they too corrupt to fail? Are they too tied in, too many accomplices?
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:57.840]  Why do the Clintons seem so invincible? The man who wrote the definitive book on the Clinton crime
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:05.200]  family and their war on women, Roger Stone, former campaign head of Trump's campaign, his business
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:08.880]  partner is the head of the campaign. And of course, he's separate from the campaigns. He can
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:14.880]  operate freely, but he always gives us the key, you know, next level info before it happens. So
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:20.720]  stonesone.com. Roger, thank you for joining us today. Alex, delighted to be with you as always.
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:27.760]  It's an extraordinary day. I must tell you, nine presidential campaigns, 40 years in American politics.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:34.800]  I've never seen anything like this. We are obviously no longer a nation of laws. Now we're a nation of
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:41.680]  men. And although the FBI director had this great reputation as a by the book law and order guy,
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:49.280]  obviously that is not the case. He said Hillary was careless. Judge Napolitano's made it clear
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:54.960]  in his analysis over and over again that criminal negligence here was more, more than sufficient
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:12:00.800]  for an indictment. Negligence, carelessness, I believe they're the same thing. So it boggles
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:05.200]  the mind that she's getting a pass, but I don't think she's going to get a pass from the voters.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:12.480]  Why do you think Comey didn't go after her? I mean, she got caught lying about it. She got caught
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:16.640]  cutting the tops off. She got caught manipulating foreign governments were in, you know, inside
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:21.680]  the servers. This is espionage. Clearly she was using as a drop box to sell data and then claims
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:25.760]  she had plausible deniability. It's very clear. I talked to a lot of experts. They concur, but
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:31.600]  why, why, why is she too big to fail with the establishment? I guess the global elites cover
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:35.680]  for each other. I think that's what's going on here. And unfortunately, it turns out our FBI
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:41.280]  director is one of the global elites. I mean, what kind of a signal does this send to everyone
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:46.400]  else who's in government? What kind of a signal does this send to every American citizen? Basically,
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:51.360]  it says violate any law you want. But if you're big enough, if you're influential enough, if you
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:56.560]  have enough money and you're well connected in the media, the law literally does not apply for you.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:02.800]  I think Donald Trump now has an opening to take the wood to Hillary. And I'd also say, Alex,
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:09.440]  the premium now is on selecting a running mate, a vice presidential running mate who is an attack
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:16.800]  dog, someone who can take the case right to Bill and Hillary and expose not only the ins and outs
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:23.120]  of the email scandal, but all of their scandals. How about you for vice president? You're a good
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:30.240]  attack dog. Nobody I could never pass the background check. I have too colorful a lifestyle. Now,
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:35.200]  we need somebody who has government experience, but someone who's a nationalist, someone who believes
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:40.960]  as Trump does that it's time to seal our borders, that it's time to repeal these ridiculous globalist
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:46.800]  trade deals that are destroying our job climate in this country. Someone who will get our fiscal
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:52.960]  house in order, stop the bailouts for the crooks on Wall Street and generate jobs for the working
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:58.640]  people of America. Clearly, clearly, excellent choices out there. And he's playing it very close
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:02.800]  to the vest. I don't know who he's going to pick, but I do know it will be a patriot.
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:07.920]  I do know it will be a nationalist. I know it will be somebody who adheres to the Trump agenda.
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:10.560]  Is Sessions still up the top of the list?
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:15.840]  Well, I think he is still under consideration. I think Jeff Sessions is a good man. And I think
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:22.720]  I've said on your show that he'd be my personal choice. But I think the Donald is casting a very
[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:28.960]  wide net. He wants to find the very best person. But now there's a premium on someone who can
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:35.280]  really take the attack to the Clintons. Because we know Donald Trump is not shy. Notice last week,
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:40.800]  he said, folks, the system's rigged. It's completely rigged. So he foreshadowed what was going to
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:47.760]  happen here. And I think that this is a blow to the Clintons. They may be celebrating the fact
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:53.360]  that she isn't going to go to prison, at least not for this. But this is a heavy burden to carry
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:59.200]  into a general election. Well, I mean, it is paradoxical that she's this evil corrupt witch
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:04.720]  with this horrible background on record and all these crimes and it's flagrantly obvious that
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:10.800]  she's being protected. It seems that the mission is somehow reach out to her constituents. But if
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:15.680]  you watch the interviews we do in Austin or in California or other places with Democrat voters,
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:19.360]  on average, these unfortunately are frighteningly ignorant people. I mean,
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:23.360]  then I don't know what the July 4th is. They don't even know what the three branches of government
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:29.120]  are. They just know, hey, there's some woman and I feel powerful if I cast my vote for a woman inside
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:36.320]  in some type of group, think how do you reach people that I don't think are as informed or awake
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.240]  as Helen Keller when she was a child? You know, she has such a great human spirit, she could
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:44.560]  actually be reached out to even though she was, you know, blind and deaf. I mean, how do you get
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:50.000]  through to a zombie? I don't understand it. Well, the good news is I don't think Hillary supporters
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:55.760]  are monolithic. I think the right best target are a third of the Bernie Sanders supporters
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:04.800]  who oppose these global trade deals, who oppose the Iraq war, who oppose the two-party duopoly
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:09.280]  that has brought this country to the brink of disaster. Exactly. How could a thinking person
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:14.400]  vote for Hillary? Well, I don't think the people who are voting for are thinking people that you
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:20.640]  you've made that point. I think they're zombies. But the question is, I think we have more supporters
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:26.480]  at the end of the day than they do. Roger, I've been asking the questions here. I mean,
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:29.760]  I think Donald Trump's just getting better and better hitting her so hardcore. But what he's
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:35.040]  saying is all true. When you talk about taking the wood to Hillary, how does Donald, I mean,
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:41.680]  we know he's his own man, but if you're advising him, how do you take the wood to Hillary? How do
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:47.120]  you really take the gloves off and put brass knuckles on? Well, the best news, of course,
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:51.520]  is we're going to have multiple debates. And there is no better place for a confrontation
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:58.080]  with the wicked witch of the West than then in those debates. Trump is a brawler. Therefore,
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:03.600]  nothing is off limits here, whether it is the Clinton's epic abuse of women, because Bill is
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:09.600]  a sexual predator. And Hillary has played the role of covering up his crimes by bullying
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:15.040]  and intimidating and threatening his victims, or whether it is the epic corruption of the
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:20.000]  Clinton Foundation, or whether it is the fact that Bill sold this country's security out.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.440]  I have a long piece on Info Wars today, an exclusive piece. When we talk about that another day,
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:30.880]  because I think the news here trumps everything, but the Clintons are guilty of treason. I mean,
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:37.040]  they have literally traded the technology regarding the targeting of our missile systems.
[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:40.320]  This is what it's all about, actually. Let's skip this network break and let's talk about the
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:44.080]  article that I'm going to have moved to the top of InfoWars.com and retweeted it at real
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:48.880]  Alex Jones. And on Facebook, everybody, just because you're patriots, libertarians, conservatives,
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:53.680]  veterans, you know about the nineties and the missile secrets, the MIRV technology, the boost
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:18:00.160]  systems, the targeting systems, the whole nine yards to have our ICBMs, the best in the world,
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:05.520]  given to the chai comms, totally insane. Just to show how brazen and crazy the Clintons are,
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:09.120]  we need to get this article out, because the general public doesn't remember this or doesn't
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:12.640]  know about it. So let's talk about the treason of the Clintons. Let's get into your article.
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:19.040]  Part one is the Russians. Part two is the Chinese. Well, it's really extraordinary, Alex. I don't
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:24.560]  think this got very much coverage at the time. The real irony here is that rather than indicting,
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:30.560]  I should say, rather than impeaching Bill Clinton for dallying with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:36.800]  Office, he should have been impeached and convicted, and then I think subsequently charged with treason
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:45.600]  for these two transactions. In essence, he ignored US law to trade high level technology
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:52.960]  to the Russians. But even more egregious, he essentially took $300,000 in illegal Chinese
[02:18:52.960 --> 02:19:00.960]  campaign contributions, passed through Johnny Chung in return for a three-party transaction
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:08.880]  in which he sold the actual technology that targets our missiles, the accuracy of our missiles,
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:16.080]  to the Chinese government. By any other name, this is treason. Now, it's a long piece and
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:22.640]  in 2,500 words, it's why I was happy to give it to Infowars because I think it needs the public
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:29.360]  exposure. I intend to come back and recycle this yet again because I'm afraid we get wiped out by
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:33.600]  the FBI news today. Sure. Let me ask you this question. It's all fixed together. It's all in
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:40.160]  the same soup. I know there's different power structures and things, but why do the elite allow
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:47.200]  the Clintons to do things nobody else can do? I mean, the nuclear reactors to North Korea that
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:51.680]  are used to build A-bombs, when they could have given them reactors that don't do that, I mean,
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:57.680]  beyond the Clintons. Who do you think they really represent? Because a lot of smart money says it's
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:03.280]  mainly the Communist Chinese, a little bit of Saudi Arabia. It was a second player, but I mean,
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:08.960]  it's just why do they work against the US interest so much? Why are they out to get us? It's the
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:13.280]  bitter clinger comments. I mean, why? They already run the country. Why are they out to get us?
[02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:18.400]  I don't think they have any loyalty to anyone. I don't think they're loyal to the Chinese,
[02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:23.360]  nor are they loyal to the United States. They are all about the money. They're all about the
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:32.160]  acquisition of wealth and power. So in truth, they will do anything for cash. That is the epic
[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:37.440]  story of the Clinton Foundation, which is not a charitable organization, but a slush fund for
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:43.920]  grifters, which is... So why do our elites allow them to operate like this? Because the mainstream
[02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:51.120]  media does not rouse the populace. And because the people don't know, therefore, there's no pressure
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:58.480]  on our institutions to bring them to justice. The story of the treasonous activities in both
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:04.880]  regard to the Russians and the Chinese, and as you point out, the North Koreans, has never gotten
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:11.360]  the kind of media coverage that it would require to rouse the people. I firmly believe if people
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:16.960]  knew about these things, they would be angry, and they would act. That's the strength of
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:23.360]  Info Wars and Breitbart and Daily Caller and all the other important alternative media that did
[02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:30.720]  not exist in the 80s when the Clintons perpetrated these crimes the first time. So the Clinton's
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:37.520]  response to all of this is, well, that's old news. You know what? No news is old if nobody heard it
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:43.200]  the first time. To them, it's new news. And... Let me tell you, ICBMs that can destroy our whole
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:48.080]  country and world that are crazy elite the Clintons gave to them, that is big news that they're going
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:53.280]  to be back in and they've helped fund ISIS, Al Qaeda. These people are pure evil. What is on
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:57.280]  your radar? Because I've got a bunch of questions. I want to talk about how Trump's doing, where this
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:02.000]  is going, what other attacks you expect, the polling numbers. There's a lot to cover at a time
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:06.240]  here, but what else do you want to get out there to the audience, Roger?
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:12.400]  Well, I do... We have a big victory today as you announced at the beginning. We have finally
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:19.040]  prevailed over the city of Cleveland. We have our permits after going to court and being represented
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:25.760]  by the liberal ACLU to do so. We have knocked down their restrictions on free speech. We don't
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:31.760]  need to bring the duct tape to Cleveland and put it over our mouths to demonstrate the outrageousness
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:38.160]  of their anti-free speech position. So the rally at which you are speaking, I am speaking, many
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:45.840]  other patriots are speaking, is July 18th at 11 o'clock in the morning at the settlers' landing
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:52.960]  park. We now have a permit from the city of Cleveland. We are scrambling to raise the money
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:59.200]  to pay for the staging that is required by the city, the public address system we will need,
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:04.480]  the marshals, and all of the other... How much money do you need? We're going to have to raise
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:09.680]  at least $30,000 to pay for everything, soup to nuts. As you know, we stopped our fundraising
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:15.680]  when the city stopped negotiating with us. Now we have to gin it back up. Let me just say this.
[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:20.320]  I've already signed a contract and I want to head and double down two contracts,
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:26.640]  $30,000 plus $5,000 of the banner in Cleveland, and then $30,000 plus $5,000 of the banner,
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:31.040]  I guess we're doing two banners, one's Info Wars, one is Hillary for Prison. We're going to mainly
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:34.480]  file a Hillary for Prison, but the Info Wars is the backup when sometimes the banners tear
[02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:39.840]  after a few flights. But we're going to have planes for four days in the air, two days at each event,
[02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:46.000]  Hillary for Prison, big giant banners. That's a $70,000 investment. I'm taking all the profits
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:50.480]  from the Hillary for Prison shirts and putting it into that, but we need to sell the shirts.
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:56.080]  They're $19.95. We're selling them at full price, not $5.95 that we were before, $5. That's at
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:00.960]  cost. I cannot do this, folks, without your support. I've already signed the contracts,
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:06.080]  so either the money comes in or somebody gets laid off, but that's not going to happen.
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:10.640]  I know that Patriot's going to come through. Buy your Hillary for Prison shirts at infowarstore.com
[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:15.600]  or call toll-free, 888-253-33139, but I'm doubling down. For my country, my kids,
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:20.880]  everything, Roger. I'm putting a $10,000 down right now, because this isn't like a political
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:23.920]  deal where it's limited, right? This is a free speech event. Can I give $10,000?
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:29.200]  That is correct. There are no limitations whatsoever on what an individual can give.
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:32.960]  I've got to start hitting the phones very hard to help raise the money.
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:40.160]  Listen, today, you want to wire whatever $10,000 from Info Wars towards this event,
[02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:44.480]  and again, this gets back to Trump. He obviously, the big money's not going to come to him. He
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:48.080]  hasn't even asked for it. He's turned it down, the Adelson money, you know, to put
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:53.360]  Gennrich on the ticket. He's a hero for that alone, hopefully that holds. But does it Trump
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:57.200]  need to go ahead and put some of the big money down first, start to put down 50-something million
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:02.000]  of his own? But shouldn't he just all in like 100 million to cause a domino effect, break the ice?
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:09.760]  Look, he put $40 million into his race for the nomination and then ate chopped liver,
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:15.920]  and he certainly has the wherewithal to do what is necessary, which is why I'm not nervous. In
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:21.520]  fact, like you, I kind of like that he hasn't taken the elite money with the strings on it.
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:27.120]  The greatest single attribute that he has going into this election is his independence, the fact
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:33.680]  that he can't be bought, he can't be bullied, he can't be bossed. He answers only to the American
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:40.400]  people, and he just will never adopt the globalist agenda. So Alex, I thank you for your generosity.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:45.520]  I think this is going to be a great rally, but the real message for all the Trump supporters out
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:52.160]  there is show of strength. We need a show of strength. Our rally is a peaceful demonstration.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:55.920]  And let me be clear, let me interrupt you, Roger, because this is so important. Folks,
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:00.640]  okay, Roger Stone works 18 hours a day. He's got a really bad cold today. He's still on
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:03.920]  air with us because he knows this is history happening. He says he's never been involved.
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:07.440]  He's been involved in like eight, you know, eight different elections. He's seen nothing like this,
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:13.280]  okay? And this is history. That's why I'm all in. It's why I'm spending every amount of money comes
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:17.520]  in this year on reporters and crew. Usually I take some profit and try to put some money back.
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:22.400]  I'm everything in this year because it's my kids, it's my country, it's my future. And I know you
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:26.640]  know that, but I'm telling you beyond sending money to help pay for this event, they tried to
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:31.200]  ban three times and there's been lawsuits and we've battled them and all the rest of it.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:34.240]  Everywhere you've got to get in the streets, everywhere you got to run for office,
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.480]  everywhere you got to call into talk radio and put up YouTube's because we've got to get outside
[02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:44.640]  the Liberty box and educate all these other folks very aggressively. But please don't thank me when
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:49.360]  you call up. I want to thank you for your support listeners. And I want to say get your butts to
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:54.000]  Cleveland. I don't care what this one rally on this morning or whatever it is, they're trying to
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:00.320]  shut our free speech down everywhere. We got to use it or lose it. This is a war and this is a fight.
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:05.120]  Okay. And so thank you for buying our products because listen, you're only going to see bigger
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:10.240]  results out of it. What you put in, you're going to get back very aggressively deployed. But Roger,
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:15.360]  how do folks go and give donations right now to help pay for this rally? We'll be posting
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:26.240]  the site earlier today. If you go to CTRAG, CTRAG.org, we'll be accepting contributions there.
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:30.880]  That's the committee to restore America's greatness. And we will transfer whatever
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:37.920]  we raise to pay for this rally. That is our immediate goal. But look, I'm very excited about
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:43.360]  it. We've got an all star line up. I'm trying to get in culture to speak. Diamond and silk will be
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:51.040]  there. This is going to be a great patriotic rally. And again, I stress this is a peaceful
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:58.080]  demonstration. We know the Black Lives Matter and the move on thugs paid for by George Soros will
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:03.920]  be there and we'll attempt in every possible way to incite violence so that the mainstream media
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:10.560]  can then blame that violence on Donald Trump's and his supporters. So come to Cleveland,
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:16.960]  but be prepared to turn the other cheek and show through numbers the support for Donald Trump.
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:21.440]  And I'm going to be there folks. Stand with us now in closing. Hillary's a monster. She's a gangster.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  We can't nobody can complain to Trump for what he's done money wise. He's already put in 40
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.560]  something million. He's put his life on the line. I really think this witch can't handle going up
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:34.080]  against him in debates. I think she's going to try to kill him. I mean, I look at photos of her and
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:38.960]  the way she's acting lately. She looks like a psychotic monster. Yeah, I think she has a dual
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:45.040]  personality. I think the book by Gary Byrne, the Secret Service agent, which the Clintons
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:49.360]  are working overtime to suppress. They've been leaning on the networks. They've been leaning
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:56.240]  on the cable networks, not to interview him, not to not to publicize you on three cable networks.
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:03.360]  Yeah, it's it's, you know, what can I say? It is it is outrageous that we would somehow
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:08.880]  think that what what this agent who served his country has to say is somehow less important or
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:14.720]  less credible than two of the biggest liars in American history, Bill and Hillary Clinton. But
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:20.720]  if you listen to what agent Byrne says, this woman is bipolar. She has two personalities.
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:26.960]  Stonezone.com Roger Stone. Thank you for coming on even though you're under the weather, my friend.
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:32.400]  You're a tough guy and we really appreciate you. We look forward to speaking to you again soon
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:37.280]  in 10 seconds. How's Trump's spirits? They look pretty strong. He's in he's in great
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:43.600]  mood. I talked to him yesterday and he's feeling good. Like all Americans, he's outraged by the
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:48.160]  offense of Hillary's legal. It's incredible. Let me say about here to the break. Roger Stone's
[02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:55.360]  our guest. We'll be back. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:30:06.560]  network. The demand for pain ray weapons grows over fears of civil unrest. According to a new
[02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:11.840]  research study, the market for directed energy weapons is expected to grow at the highest rate
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:17.440]  during the forecast period. Thanks for their use in controlling riots and cross border trespassing.
[02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:23.520]  The global riot control system market is estimated to grow from $9 billion in 2016
[02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:30.720]  to $11.78 billion by 2021. As a result of increasing political disputes and civil unrest,
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:35.440]  militarization of law enforcement agencies, stringent environmental and governmental
[02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:40.800]  regulations and declining defense budgets of developed economies states the report.
[02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:46.480]  So-called pain rays or active denial systems work by blasting controlled microwaves into a
[02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:51.920]  crowd of people creating an unbearably hot sensation that forces them to flee the scene.

[02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:04.800]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but we're waiting for an outrageously
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:09.360]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends,
[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:13.920]  we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen,
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:19.120]  solar generators really do provide lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators,
[02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:24.000]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:28.400]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:32.000]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:37.520]  news if you want to get one this week. Solutions From Science has a big sale on their fast charge
[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:42.080]  solar generators and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid
[02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:46.960]  gear in addition to the low price for info wars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out.

[02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:22.800]  All right. I appreciate Denise holding. I appreciate Sergeant B holding. I appreciate Shane and
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:28.960]  Lonnie and Justin. Everybody, I'm going to get to all of you right now. Just briefly, I was talking to
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:36.720]  Roger Stone during the break about the fact that we had to raise like $32,000 just to have like a
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:41.200]  four or five hour rally down there. Look, there's going to be massive media coverage to this. It's
[02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:45.840]  right across from the RNC's meeting. The George Soros people aren't going to get permits. They're
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:50.720]  going to do whatever they want and run around and, you know, attack and spit on things and just do
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:55.680]  what they generally do because they serve the foreign multinational globalists. That's why they
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:01.040]  claim they're anti-established, but they are the filth of the earth. But they make them get
[02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:06.640]  PA systems, porta-potties and pay for the police. That is wrong. It should be in the police budget
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:11.760]  to take care of big rallies and big demonstrations around key times like this.
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:18.560]  But it's libertarians and it's patriots and it's conservatives that try to not cause a disturbance.
[02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:24.960]  But I'll tell you something. When I get told I can't have a demonstration, but other people can,
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:28.800]  I'm going to have it regardless. Well, the good news is they've backed off because of two different
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:34.000]  lawsuits and they claim this is it. So that's why I'm going to this. I'm going to be part of this
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:40.880]  because it's a symbol of free speech and the globalists are coming out to free speech. But beyond
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:45.680]  that, I've got all sorts of tricks up my sleeve that are legal and lawful for Cleveland.
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:54.560]  But we're going to put out hundreds of thousands of leaflets. We're going to do other things.
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:59.520]  We're going to have aircraft in the sky. And believe me, Hillary will go to the level we've
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:06.000]  had this before with the Democrats especially, try to block us doing things like putting aircraft
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:10.880]  in the sky. That just becomes a bigger issue. See, people think you fight tyranny and then
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:15.040]  you get defeated at one level in one battle you've lost. No, you learn about the enemy,
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:19.680]  you expose what they're doing, you show people their tyrants. That's the beginning of the end.
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:24.800]  Like the corrupt EU saying, we're not going to allow a vote. We're just taking you over.
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:31.600]  Well, in the end, people started backlashing against that. Only submitting to tyranny is
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:37.200]  how you lose. Resisting it, you always end up winning. It may take five years. It may take
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:43.360]  10 years. It may take six months. But the worm is turning. Just to give people the good news,
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:48.240]  infowars is one of the main focal points, not just here in the U.S. but all over the world,
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:54.000]  of resistance to globalism. And we've gone from being ridiculed, demonized, attacked,
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:00.320]  just totally lied about to more and more, especially in other nations. It's not just populist
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:05.520]  or right-wingers that like us. It's true liberals and it's nationalists that are just common sense
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:12.320]  all over the world, from Brazil to South Africa, from Nigeria to Japan, from Russia to Germany,
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:18.960]  from the U.K. to Canada, from Mexico to Chile to Australia. Infowars in many cases
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:23.600]  is more popular per capita in foreign nations.
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:29.840]  A couple of African nations were like in the top 20 and stuff. It's crazy.
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:35.280]  So let me tell you something. People are listening worldwide.
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:44.000]  And Americans, to a certain extent, are in this bubble. Americans have the lowest level of passports
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.120]  except for North Korea. Americans, on average, do have the fattest. I'm not saying folks are
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:52.480]  overweight. I've been overweight before too. But I'm just saying on average, the fattest,
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:56.720]  dumbest, most lethargic people. Doesn't mean we're all bad, but statistically,
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:36:58.960]  we are at the bottom of the barrel.
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:06.720]  But that's starting to change because once you hit bottom, there's nowhere else to go but up,
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:12.320]  right? Historically. So I want to commend all of you for your support. I want to commend you all
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:18.240]  for your prayers. That's what I really need because I'm in such a fight with the globalists. I know
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:22.480]  the stakes. I know how real it is and I just get sick at my stomach. Like I'm not working hard enough,
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:29.520]  like I'm not doing enough, like I'm not sometimes like five or six, I got to do more work and I
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:34.640]  want to, my spirit wants to, my flesh is weak and I'm just like dizzy. I'm so exhausted and I just
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:38.720]  got more to do and I know I could fight the enemy and I could put out a viral video and I could
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:42.800]  really expose this and I've got to learn to just go, I give it to God, this is all I can do, just
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:49.200]  turn loose. Or I'm going to have a heart attack by the time I'm 55 and I don't want that. So my
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:53.600]  kids deserve me to be healthy. But all I'm saying is don't call up telling me how great I am because
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:38:00.720]  it's the opposite of that. My guts and everything are like fight harder and I'm very angry at myself.
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:04.960]  Okay? And that's not a listening going, oh Alex, you're doing good. Don't worry about it. I'm really
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:10.080]  telling you how I feel because I know how bad these people are. I know how evil they are. It really
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:16.960]  freaks me out. I mean, look at that photo that's up on Real Alex Jones on Twitter again. This is
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:21.360]  I'm convinced the most evil photo of Hillary I've ever seen. And you really look at her,
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:34.080]  I look at this photo of her and man, I actually, my heart flutters. Oh God, oh God, oh God, those
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:41.440]  eyes tell you everything you need to know. Man, she enjoys power. She enjoys lies. She
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:46.560]  enjoys suppression. She treats everybody like crap. She doesn't give tips. She doesn't let
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:56.560]  you look her in the eye. She is an arrogant monster pig. She hates us so much, folks. Oh my God.
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:02.480]  I think she might cause a nuclear war or something. I just, there's something about her. I think,
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:08.240]  I look at Kim Jong-un and I also have the same feeling, but not as bad. It's just, oh, it's so
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:12.480]  bad because they're so soft and weak, but because they're in a bully position, they can get away
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:24.240]  with anything. Oh, like a vampire. Um, briefly, I'm already putting planes in the sky for four days
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:30.080]  over the RNC and DNC. I looked at blimps. Those are just way too much. We're talking
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:35.760]  half a million dollar commitment for a big blimp. And then, and of course that's like a
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:38.240]  multi-month contract. They go to all these different cities. They just don't do it where
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:42.880]  you go to one city. Can you imagine a blimp one around St. Hilary for president? Oh, that'd be
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:46.880]  the biggest thing ever. It's like Scarface. The world is yours instead. You're going to
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:51.120]  President Hillary. A good year blimp court. I know they'd get involved and block that.
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:55.520]  We've already got a couple backup air forces ready with the more primitive banners that if
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:59.040]  they try to block us with this group or something, you know, we'll just shift to another backup plan.
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:02.880]  But the point is we need to sell a lot of the Hilary for president t-shirts to pay for that.
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:08.000]  But regardless, I'm all in M4store.com. Our fourth of July mega special is going to be extended
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.680]  throughout the week. I'm only able to do this a couple times a year, but they've allowed us because
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:15.840]  of all the globalist talk of food shortages and food price increases, which I hope aren't the case,
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:20.400]  but we're preparing, you know, for the worst, hoping for the best here. We got 20 to 40% off

[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:51.360]  the operation. Plus, these are things everybody needs going into these very uncertain times.
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:58.240]  Patriots need to be self-sufficient. The enemy bets their whole game plan on us being dependent on
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:03.920]  them. And prepping now is absolutely essential. It's gone from a possibility of collapse,
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:07.920]  to a probability, to a certainty. It just depends on how bad it'll be. But worldwide,
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:10.720]  it's already in full swing. We're already in a depression in most areas. It's just
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:14.080]  unequally distributed. You can call toll free to ask any questions about specials that are
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:21.920]  ordered via the phone as well. Triple 8-2533-139. Triple 8-2533-139. Okay. I appreciate Denise
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:28.240]  and Sergeant B and Shane. Everybody else holding. I'm going to go to you right now. Thank you for
[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:33.200]  holding. Denise from Illinois, what do you think of the FBI director admitting she did all these
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:40.720]  horrible things but says they can't indict her? Now, I'm calling just to point out the flags
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:48.640]  in the Comey speech on both sides of them. The blue flag that's a federal department. The world
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:55.200]  federal is upside down and backwards. So between their false flags and their theatrics,
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:00.160]  they're getting pretty floppy. They don't really have the flags right. You don't really have a
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:07.120]  press conference. There's no media there, no flashbolts going off. And if Hillary becomes the
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:13.280]  president and 150 million loser jobs, I think we're going to have nothing better to do than walk
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:19.360]  the streets of Washington. That's a good point that I didn't hear any press in there, but they
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:22.960]  called it a statement in the press conference. More and more, they tell the press what to do.
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:26.800]  They get their questions beforehand. More and more, we act like a Soviet nation.
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:35.920]  And if you look at those flags, who bought these flags? But talk a little prophecy now.
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:41.680]  As far as Hillary, she's president, I can't put out there the fact that
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:45.760]  Antichrist couldn't be a woman. That's all I got to say. I appreciate your call.
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:49.360]  Everybody always says that every new evil leader is the Antichrist and Obama's the
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:54.240]  Antichrist and the rest of this. The Bible says there are many Antichrist, the Antichrist spirit.
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:43:02.240]  There is the Antichrist. But I think when you're shelling baby parts and putting baby flavoring
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:06.960]  and soft drinks and shelling us out at the Communist Chinese, trying to break up families,
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:11.760]  I mean, these are evil people. These are evil, evil, evil people. I don't think there's any
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:14.880]  doubting that. And there are more and more signs in government of the wheels coming off.
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:20.800]  And look, the globalists want a civil war. And as I've gotten a little more sophisticated in the
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:24.960]  last few years, last decade or so, really, I realized we got big problems with government.
[02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:28.960]  But it's big mega corporations that have taken control of our government
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:33.600]  that want totalitarianism that have set it up. So instead of just blaming the TSA,
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:38.080]  when most of them are just workers that want to paycheck and buy into this false narrative,
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:41.440]  some of them are bad. It's come out. We should blame Congress. It leaves our borders open,
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:46.960]  flies in all these foreigners, doesn't check them, but then checks us. This is slave training.
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:51.440]  So let's blame Congress instead of just blaming the TSA. And I say blame them too.
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:56.160]  And when it gets down to the police, yeah, we can all see footage of a 330 million Americans,
[02:43:56.160 --> 02:44:05.520]  bad cops and corruption and problems and go after it. But just making it the issue and making,
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:10.400]  you know, shooting a cop while they pump gas or change the tire, that's how you fix things.
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:16.720]  That will show them. That's all globalist garbage to absolutely bring this country into a civil war
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:22.480]  and brand the civil war as citizens running around, burning things and overturning police cars.
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:27.680]  If there's a civil war in this country that the globalist start, we need to think about
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:33.280]  the big brokers, the globalists, the technicians, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation,
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:37.920]  the Carnegie Endowment. You know, they want a war. I'm not calling for anything violent.
[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:42.640]  I'm just, we need to identify the collaborators, the globalist, the people that have come in and
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:52.400]  taken control, the George Soros of the world who are trying to start a civil war in this country
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:59.280]  and who successfully started them all over the world. Let's go ahead and go to Sergeant B from
[02:44:59.280 --> 02:45:06.400]  Texas. You're on the air. Welcome. Hey, Alex. I want to put a call out to everyone listening.
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:13.120]  We need everyone out there who has any skills in multimedia, audio, video, PowerPoint,
[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:18.960]  slide shows, you name it, need a campaign and start putting out a list of everyone who's been
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:27.200]  prosecuted for the same crimes Hillary committed with the quote by Director Comey saying no
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:32.080]  reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case because it's obviously bull.
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:38.320]  Right in US Code 793, it is stated in multiple paragraphs, very word, I'm not going to read
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:43.840]  the whole thing, but it does state very clearly what he said in that in that press conference
[02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:50.480]  today that she did commit these crimes and it does state shall be found under this type of
[02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:58.080]  warm prison, not more than 10 years or both. That's right. This needs to be viral. It needs to be
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:04.720]  it needs to be put out in every single media and it needs to be done now. By the way, Joe Biggs,
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:09.520]  who's going to the border today, just ran in here earlier when Liam was in studio and said,
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:17.520]  look, we should start a meme basically showing all the people that have been charged for the
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:22.960]  exact same thing that Hillary did and do a poll basically of prosecutors to get their
[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:26.960]  response. And we know what the answer is going to be. No, you would always be indicted for this.
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:29.600]  But that's a great point. We should go through and show all the people
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:33.760]  that have been indicted for a lot less. So that's a great point.
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:38.960]  That's exactly it. And it's not just enough for us to talk to each other who are already
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:44.160]  knowledgeable about this. We need to reach out to these liberal idiots who don't have any concept
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:48.880]  of the rule of law. And we need to reach out to them and bang them over the head with this knowledge
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:53.280]  and get them to understand why it's wrong. She didn't break rules. She broke the federal law.
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:57.920]  Well, look, I know all these idiot, so-called leftists are really a bunch of moron fascists,
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:02.000]  but I want to say something to them. Communist China has killed over 100 million of its people,
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:08.880]  mal killed 80 something million. Women and men are slaves. They have absolutely no rights unless
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:13.120]  they're in the party. It's total evil. No environmental standards, no nothing. But you're
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:20.320]  too busy hating America to ever realize how hellish Venezuela or China are. And so they don't care
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:25.440]  if Hillary sold out to the Imams and sold out to these Gulf states that murder women and murder
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:30.080]  homosexuals. They just don't care. I don't think they care. They like the fact that they think
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:34.560]  they're on a winning team, even though they're schmucks being destroyed by Hillary. So I don't
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:38.960]  know how we reach out to them. I don't know how we get them to turn around. They are just,
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:45.760]  they are just horrible people. We need to fight with the Info War, exactly like your name and state.
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:49.520]  It needs to be an Info War. We need them to be knowledgeable because that's the biggest problem
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:54.560]  in this country right now is ignorance. People are ignorant of the rules. They're ignorant of the law
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:59.040]  and they think that when they see CNN, Comedy Central and all these other stupid little media
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:02.560]  sources saying it's okay, they believe it because they're just plain ignorant.
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:07.840]  Many videos that you've been conned, you're in a trance. Comedy Central isn't your friend.
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:13.440]  They're lying to you. They're politically paid to do all this. Stewart's brother runs the New
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:17.280]  York Stock Exchange. This is a scam, kind of like the end of Running Man when they go,
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:20.960]  Damon is lying to you and then show the lies. It's time to do it.
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:26.080]  That's right. Absolutely. And it's not just nothing. Even if people after, like my call out was
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:30.080]  for people with these skills, even if you don't have those skills, people need to start having
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:34.960]  these conversations with people in the grocery store, at libraries, wherever you go. Start asking
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:40.080]  people. If you know somebody who is a Hillary supporter, ask them, arm yourself with the knowledge
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:44.560]  of these other cases where people have been convicted and ask these people, why is it okay
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:49.120]  that these people are being convicted, but she doesn't have to be, that she can be president?
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:55.200]  In 60 seconds, what would you say to one of these zombies to wake them up?
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.760]  I would ask them. I would say exactly like I just said. Say, look, we have multiple cases.
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:08.800]  You can't even have the full list of all the people who have been prosecuted.
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:16.320]  These people have been prosecuted for the same laws that she violated. Why is it okay for her,
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:22.160]  but not for them? Why is it that she can be president, but they have to be in jail?
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:29.040]  I handled classified material myself when I was in the army. If I did what she did,
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:35.760]  I would be in a federal prison right now. It would have been an open and shut case,
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:40.800]  but she gets to be considered as president of the United States.
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:45.280]  That's because the globalists want a dictator. They want someone in who's an elected dictator,
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:50.000]  and people think elected dictator. Yeah, a dictator just ignores the laws. They may be elected,
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.640]  but they begin to do whatever they want. And they're setting the stage for Hillary to be
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:59.600]  a true dictator. That's exactly what the former senior service agent said high level. He said,
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:03.440]  look, she wants the socials dictatorship. And the average idiot here is that goes, oh good,
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:08.960]  I'll get free stuff. No, you'll be made a domesticated slave of the system. God bless
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:14.240]  you, Sergeant B. I appreciate your call. And it's not the Republicans are great either.
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:16.240]  That's why the Republican leadership has been against Trump.
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:19.600]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:25.680]  this is the takedown of America. They take down your law
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:31.040]  in front of you and set the precedent they can do anything they want whenever they want.
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:42.080]  Shane and Oregon, you're up next. Then we're going to talk to Justin X, Lana, Paul, and others.

[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:06.880]  I didn't care that much about religion. Some friends of mine encouraged me to pick up the
[02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:11.680]  Bible and then showed me that a lot of what I was taught was not even in the Bible. They showed me
[02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:17.680]  a website called thebible says that.org. The Q and A format was simple and it helped me find my own
[02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:22.960]  answers. This website challenges and dismantles misguided religious doctrines. Check out the

[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:08.480]  Look, I'm going to go right back to your calls but I want to just say something historical that's
[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:14.000]  a known fact. Every historian, every sociologist, anthropologist knows this and I know most of
[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:18.240]  you know this. A lot of folks I talk to aren't aware of this because they don't teach history
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:22.960]  anymore, real history. They just teach a bunch of guilt and hate the West because the globalists
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:30.000]  are bringing in a technocracy that the Renaissance and the ideas of the West threaten. Not that the
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:35.200]  West was ever anywhere near perfect. My God, the West has done some of the worst stuff, okay?
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:42.240]  But we've also done some of the best stuff. That's a fact. Those that dare greatly also stoop down
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:50.080]  pretty low. So I don't lionize the West. I just know it has boldly done things for liberty
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:55.760]  and the expansion of human freedom that nobody else has done. There's been a lot of other great
[02:54:55.760 --> 02:54:59.360]  teachings from other parts of the world. A lot of amazing stuff from Asia, you name it.
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:04.720]  But at the end of the day, the West is the best to quote Jim Morrison. The ideas are,
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:09.120]  the intellectual ideas, the open freedom, the people that actually delivered freedom instead
[02:55:09.120 --> 02:55:16.000]  of talking about it. And that's why the West is being killed. Beyond Westerners,
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:22.240]  the idea of the West is being gotten rid of by the globalists because it's in competition with them.
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:26.640]  Freedom or the American system, which was one of the greatest examples of that,
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:29.440]  the elites a hundred years ago would openly write newspapers. We've got to get rid of the
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:33.280]  American system. It can make anybody rich and powerful. It can make anybody successful. It
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:37.440]  makes people independent. It makes all these different groups out there that can do whatever
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:44.880]  they want. And centralized control, robber barons don't like that. And so these globalists at CFR
[02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:49.120]  meetings and Bilderberg meetings and Club of Rome meetings and Davos meetings, they get together
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:53.120]  and they put out press statements about, we need to just dominate the public and openly make them
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:59.280]  slaves. Yeah, the public's all dumb, which you help make dumb. You set up, they're all arrogant.
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:03.360]  Most of you didn't even make your own money. You got it five, six generations back on average.
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:07.680]  That's on average. The average elitist today got their money five, six generations ago.
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:11.520]  Very few actually made it themselves.
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:20.160]  And so many of the elites you see like Bill Gates were actually given all of it as well.
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:27.680]  He's a total front guy. So what I'm getting at is this. Don't think Hillary is invincible because
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:31.760]  she thinks she's invincible and wants you to think she's invincible. That's her own delusion,
[02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:37.840]  which is a con game that if it's successful enough might actually work on you. But this is
[02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:42.800]  megalomania, okay? Like the more success and power I get, the more insecure I get and the
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:48.800]  more I'm afraid to make a mistake because I don't want to hurt people. That's a normal grown-up thing
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:53.600]  as you get more power and more responsibility, you get more careful. Not with elites in history
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:58.800]  when they're megalomaniacs. As they get more power, they feel more invincible. So don't think for all
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:05.200]  their arrogance that they won't be defeated. My only concern is when they've dominated their
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:11.280]  domestic populations and had been found to be above the law, almost every case they start wars
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:21.120]  with other people. And three times in the last 200 years, they've done it with Russia. Three times.
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:26.320]  Say which one about Russia it hadn't been taken over yet and just it's just where
[02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:33.040]  empires go to start giant wars. Now there's nuclear weapons. Now our elite is allied with the Chinese.
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:36.240]  The Russians aren't stupid. They know there's a sneak attack plan with both companies to attack
[02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:40.080]  Russia. And I'm not lionizing Russia. I'm just saying it hasn't been taken over except by the
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:44.240]  Communist Revolution, but still not completely. And then they overthrew that. So I'm really worried
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:49.760]  about Hillary, folks. Once she's got full control of the US, you watch. She's going to turn her eyes
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:56.480]  outward. And as much as I kind of want her to leave us alone and move on, it's going to come back
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:03.680]  on us, folks. You think Hitler was bad? Hillary is a complete lunatic. They've got nothing but
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:07.920]  women now running the State Department and most of the decisions the Pentagon. And it's weird.
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:11.360]  None of them have been in combat. They all wear these fancy dresses. They get out there and make
[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:15.840]  weird comments about how good they are at killing people. And then they just shoot their mouths off.
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:22.240]  I mean, it just reeks of nuclear war, reeks of defeat, reeks of hell.
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:29.680]  I mean, you've got a bunch of whacked out weirdos on a bunch of drugs and crap. I mean, I can look
[02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:33.040]  at Hillary and Samantha Powers and all of them and tell you, those women are on drugs if I've ever
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:37.760]  seen it. And they have got to be brought. They've got to be stopped, people. We've got to stop them.
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:40.400]  We're going to take a few more calls and the baton to Watson. I'm just telling you,
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:46.960]  we've got to stop these people. They're megalomaniacs before they stop themselves by blowing
[02:58:46.960 --> 02:58:54.000]  everything up. If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for
[02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:58.800]  an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why.
[02:58:58.800 --> 02:59:03.920]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen.
[02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:09.040]  Solar generators really do provide lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators,
[02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:14.000]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:19.120]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to
[02:59:19.120 --> 02:59:22.880]  have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get
[02:59:22.880 --> 02:59:28.560]  one this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and
[02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:33.760]  they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price
[02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:40.320]  for M4Wars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:45.760]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money. Go to gridwars.com.
[02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:47.280]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:59:47.280 --> 02:59:59.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:09.680]  The truth is a powerful thing. I suggest we use it.
[03:00:09.680 --> 03:00:18.720]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:26.240]  to Alex Jones. All right, going right to your phone calls. I love how Trump's calling in a rig
[03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:30.880]  system and it's all fraud because that's true. You have to overthrow the entire corrupt system
[03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:35.280]  that's come in and taken over our country. You don't just debate with it and play games with it.
[03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:39.920]  You admit it's rigged but Bernie Sanders won't do that. He's going to let Hillary rob him.
[03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:43.680]  Let's go to Shane in Oregon. Shane, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:51.120]  Thank you for taking the call, Alex. Thank you. I'm a fairly new listener. I've just found you
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:57.040]  about a year and a half ago but I thank the good Lord that I did. I listen to you religiously.
[03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:02.640]  I drive for living so I listen to you all day while you're on live and then I find you on
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:08.400]  YouTube. Well, thanks for putting up with me, brother. First, I just want to say thank you again
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:13.360]  for everything you do. Your reporters are out of this world. Everything that you guys putting
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:19.120]  out there is just, I mean, I can't even explain how urgent this information is to get it out
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:28.080]  to the people and I'm a 13 year veteran of the United States Army and I want to just say real
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:32.720]  quick, I have a lot of stuff I wanted to touch on. Go ahead. Take your time. I think this is
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:40.960]  really important that we, the people, we need to stand behind Mr. Trump and, you know, really,
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:46.320]  really support him because he's basically put his entire life and family on the line.
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:49.440]  I think there's a good chance they're going to kill him. I'd say it's about a 50% chance
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:55.600]  he's they're going to kill him. They'll blow his plane up in front of everybody. I'm telling you,
[03:01:55.600 --> 03:02:03.280]  they'll do anything. Yeah. And unfortunately, I feel that same way. But, you know, we, the people
[03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:08.000]  just really stand up to support him because he is the only hope that we have to touch you to
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:12.080]  become great again. I think they want a civil war. They might kill Trump to start it. Oh,
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:20.000]  there's no end to these people. And, you know, I think that one of the colors touched on something
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:25.760]  earlier. And I think Jakari also touched on it that, you know, that what we're being fed, basically
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:31.520]  spoon fed and being dumbed down through our, you know, mainstream media, that's all the people,
[03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:37.520]  you know, they think it's out there. And so it's our job as the employees to, you know,
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:40.880]  put the information out there and help educate people because I know I found you.
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:45.840]  I've been, you know, baby stepping with my family and friends and at least getting
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:51.760]  interested because that's how the battle just gets someone interested. Absolutely. And then as
[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:56.640]  more tyranny comes in, unfortunately, down the road, they'll even wake up more. And baby steps
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:00.480]  are great. Sometimes the family is there hard to wake up. I hit people right in the face with the
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:04.320]  truth and just say, listen, you understand the globalists are taking this country over right
[03:03:04.320 --> 03:03:09.040]  now and they're trying to end our prosperity by design. We need to get involved to bring back
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:15.600]  just a basic system of Americana that produced the wealth and the success we had. God bless
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:21.200]  you, Shane. Good to hear from you. Let's take another call here. Let's talk to Justin X in the
[03:03:22.080 --> 03:03:30.800]  live, free or die state of New Hampshire. Hello? Yes, sir. Yes. Long time listener,
[03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:39.120]  first time caller. I felt compelled to call today because just like you, I have a powerful
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:45.360]  thickening feeling in my gut and I don't know, it's not good. Last time I had this feeling was,
[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:51.040]  I was out of the country during the Boston bombing. As I'm flying in, I'm looking at
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:57.120]  the Golden Gate Bridge and I just get this sick and it's feeling in my gut.
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:03.040]  And come to find out the people in Boston sheared the people that were dragging them out of their
[03:04:03.040 --> 03:04:14.000]  houses. So really, the only real solution is individual non-compliance with the edicts of
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:18.960]  itself. I agree. I agree. And more and more, we just, you know, we have to support local
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:22.880]  government and people when they're doing the right thing. But when systems are under globalist
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:26.320]  control and not, we have to absolutely not comply. It's now reached that point.
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:32.080]  I mean, yes, because we can hope for Trump to change things for us. But just like you just said,
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:36.240]  I question if there's even going to be election. They're moving quickly.
[03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:42.400]  I just have this feeling after seeing this, it's going to move.
[03:04:43.040 --> 03:04:46.400]  I agree. I mean, that's why I've said this. I've never said this in, you know, years of
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:49.280]  selling horrible food. I've never said, now I believe you're going to actually need this for
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:53.360]  sure. I've never said, you know, I'm getting a bunch extra from me. I mean, I really believe that.
[03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:58.240]  I just have a sickening feeling. I'm like, my gut is just get ready to carry your own family at this
[03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:04.400]  point. Let's face it. Most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones. But recent studies
[03:05:04.400 --> 03:05:09.280]  link cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer. Experts say parents
[03:05:09.280 --> 03:05:14.320]  and expecting mothers need to be extra careful. Doctors say the infant brain, even while in
[03:05:14.320 --> 03:05:19.040]  the womb, is especially vulnerable. So keep the phone away from your abdomen, especially
[03:05:19.040 --> 03:05:24.160]  toward the end of pregnancy. And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is
[03:05:24.160 --> 03:05:29.360]  literally cooking your sperm, lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child
[03:05:29.360 --> 03:05:33.280]  could be difficult. This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[03:05:33.280 --> 03:05:37.040]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is
[03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:41.920]  actually disrupting your sleep rhythms. This causes insomnia and slow some metabolism. Hello,
[03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:46.640]  weight gain. Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio
[03:05:46.640 --> 03:05:51.440]  frequency radiation. So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can. Keep the phone at least two
[03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:55.840]  feet away from your body. Use headphones. And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away
[03:05:55.840 --> 03:05:59.120]  from you as possible. Leigh Ann McAdoo with your info wars tip of the week.

[03:08:03.120 --> 03:08:11.840]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:20.320]  We have global combines that have taken control of most of the planet who have successfully
[03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:25.200]  overthrown nation after nation, openly doing banker bail ins in Europe, flooding the countries
[03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:30.400]  with 5 million foreigners, covering up their mass rapes. You name it, I've got articles here. We're
[03:08:30.400 --> 03:08:35.920]  in London. Islamist Muslim cab driver says it's against his religion to take blind man with a
[03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:42.560]  guide dog and the person tells him it violates his disability. He says I don't care and nothing
[03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:48.240]  will be done to him for that. They are above the law. They are gods. That's why they don't get
[03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:52.080]  searched by the TSA. You name it. And again, people say, well, you didn't use to be so as
[03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:56.000]  long a phobic. I didn't want to destabilize the Middle East and have a giant war. The point
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:01.680]  is they're bringing people in from the most backward third world hell pits where many women
[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:06.080]  aren't even allowed out of the house. And then there's all these weird sickening feminist groups
[03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:11.200]  out attacking me saying I'm Islamophobic with weirdo like 18 year old girls with their faces
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:16.560]  painted up saying I'm a feminist screaming to defend the Muslims. I mean, it is literal
[03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:23.760]  mental suicide they're engaged in. It is the opposite of logic. I don't understand how we
[03:09:23.760 --> 03:09:29.040]  manufactured such freak shows. And then we've got, I'm sure Paul's getting into this because
[03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:35.680]  it's his beat, exposing it. This leader in Sweden saying, well, when our men rape women,
[03:09:35.680 --> 03:09:38.560]  it's bad, even though they're like less than 10% of the rapes. But when the Muslims do it,
[03:09:38.560 --> 03:09:43.520]  it's just their culture. This is where we're going. Now, we've got some calls here that have been
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:47.360]  holding a while. It's why I held over so I could go to those. I was going to talk to Paul and
[03:09:47.360 --> 03:09:53.440]  Stormy and Lana. In fact, Lana is here in a moment. But briefly, it's time to get prepared.
[03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:57.840]  That's what we're running a special 20 to 40% off on this super high quality, super fresh,

[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:15.040]  groups hurting them. Those drudge info wars and down the line from there. We are now the symbol
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:20.560]  of independent, liberty based, populist media worldwide. We're changing the world. Nigel Farage
[03:11:20.560 --> 03:11:24.720]  used to come on like 15 years ago. And he come on just a few years ago as well. And he's, he
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:28.240]  admitted, wow, you're really big over here in England. You're getting us a lot of UKIP members.
[03:11:28.240 --> 03:11:34.320]  I'm proud of that. I'm proud of you. We're all in this together. So don't thank me. I want to thank
[03:11:34.320 --> 03:11:39.040]  you. We're in this together. Paul Watson, a lot going on. Tell us what's coming up today. Obviously
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:43.920]  you're talking about Hillary. I mean, I see this as a, the elite breaking away from justice completely
[03:11:43.920 --> 03:11:48.400]  in a declaration of independence against the rule of law declaration of dictatorship, Paul.
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:54.800]  Paul. Well, it's completely brazen, Alex. And I mean, the meeting itself with Loretta Lynch and
[03:11:54.800 --> 03:12:00.560]  Bill Clinton, a lot of people speculated that Bill Clinton did that because he could. He didn't
[03:12:00.560 --> 03:12:05.600]  even care about the optics. He didn't care how bad it would look. And, you know, this is what you
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:10.160]  talked about earlier, the brazenness of the elite. You know, there was a tweet from Hillary Clinton
[03:12:10.160 --> 03:12:16.720]  back in January. There should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too big to jail.
[03:12:16.720 --> 03:12:22.800]  Paul. Well, that's been disproven today. You had Comey lay out for 15 minutes how she had broken
[03:12:22.800 --> 03:12:28.800]  the law. And we've got numerous examples from past cases about how people did exactly this,
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:34.320]  mishandling of classified information. They were punished for it. So he laid it out how she broke
[03:12:34.320 --> 03:12:40.560]  the law and then concluded that she was above the law. And I mean, this is scary because people
[03:12:40.560 --> 03:12:46.240]  are already out saying, well, if the highest elected representatives in the country are immune
[03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:53.040]  from the law or above the law, then why should I pay my taxes? Why should I follow the law?
[03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:57.840]  So it's, it could lead, I mean, eventually down the line to some form of civil and racist.
[03:12:57.840 --> 03:13:03.040]  That's how Mexico had super low crime 50 years ago and degenerated. The public sees the government
[03:13:03.040 --> 03:13:06.560]  not following the law. That's what makes civilizations fall, Paul. That's a good point.
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:12.320]  No, exactly. They see that the highest elected representatives in the land
[03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:18.160]  have no appreciation for and are protected from the law. So how do they behave? How do they respond?
[03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:22.320]  We've already seen it. There's an article up on Info Wars where I collated some of the comments
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:25.680]  just off Twitter and some of the websites of people responding to this.
[03:13:26.320 --> 03:13:31.920]  Absolutely unremitting fury from people saying that this is the end of the line for them.
[03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:37.760]  They've tolerated enough. And this is just a step too far. But, you know, I'm going to get into the
[03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:44.240]  previous cases when I get up and host the show in a little while. Numerous cases where people have
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:49.200]  done exactly this, mishandled classified information, not even deliberately. Remember,
[03:13:49.200 --> 03:13:54.640]  that's not the standard that she's being held to, not deliberately. And yet we have Comey coming
[03:13:54.640 --> 03:14:00.320]  out with this quote. Again, quote, to be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances,
[03:14:00.320 --> 03:14:05.360]  a person who engage in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals
[03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:11.200]  are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. So again, they're subject to misdemeanor
[03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:15.520]  charges, fines, imprisonment. He warns him. He said, listen, just because she's not getting in
[03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:21.200]  trouble, doesn't mean you won't. They're even telling the government she's above the law and
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:27.760]  that they aren't. That's crazy, man. It's completely out of control. I mean, even a lot of people on
[03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:34.400]  the left from what I've seen are just absolutely flabbergasted by this. The one crumb of comfort,
[03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:40.000]  I guess for Trump, which some people have pointed out is that, you know, 2016 is the year of complete
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:45.840]  rebellion against the status quo. This is not only going to fire up his base, but it's also going to
[03:14:45.840 --> 03:14:52.240]  enrage those independents who are leaning Republican to vote for Trump. It's going to influence the
[03:14:52.240 --> 03:14:56.240]  Bernie Sanders supporters, 50% of whom said they wouldn't vote for Hillary.
[03:14:56.240 --> 03:14:59.920]  Here's the good news. Trump doesn't even know what an email server is. That's kind of a good thing.
[03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:04.960]  He like, it's emails handed to him, print it off. He knows how to use a Twitter, but don't
[03:15:04.960 --> 03:15:08.880]  worry. He won't have any secret servers because he's not a big tech guy. I tell you, Hillary is a
[03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:13.120]  true slime ball. I want to take a call or two and they hand the baton to you, Paul. But I think
[03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:16.720]  this just signifies the battle lines. They're going into overdrive. They have nothing to lose.
[03:15:16.720 --> 03:15:20.960]  They're cornered. Humanity is waking up. This is just an epic time to be alive.
[03:15:21.680 --> 03:15:24.480]  But what do you think Hillary is going to do if she actually gets in?
[03:15:25.120 --> 03:15:29.040]  My bigger concern isn't that she'll just persecute us. We know that's coming. That's already happened.
[03:15:29.040 --> 03:15:33.520]  I've already been under Bill and Hillary before and enjoyed it. Let me tell you,
[03:15:33.520 --> 03:15:36.320]  it's always fun to get knocked upside the head by a bunch of thugs attacking. You say,
[03:15:36.320 --> 03:15:41.120]  don't talk about the Clintons if they punch you. I punch back. That's what they found out.
[03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:46.880]  So I guess they didn't come back. But side issue, Paul, what do you think she's going
[03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:52.400]  to do when she gets in? I think she might start World War III because this instinct to dominate
[03:15:52.400 --> 03:15:57.680]  and rule everyone, this megalomania in her is so strong. I mean, the dark side is strong in this
[03:15:57.680 --> 03:16:03.840]  one. No, I mean, that is the fear that she could amp up this Cold War situation with Russia.
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:07.680]  By the way, the Russians say that. They say she may be the worst president ever. They absolutely,
[03:16:07.680 --> 03:16:10.560]  and their analysis think Hillary is just like the fricking Antichrist.
[03:16:11.200 --> 03:16:16.320]  Oh, no. I mean, Putin said words to that effect a couple of weeks ago, and he said he could probably
[03:16:16.320 --> 03:16:21.200]  get along with Trump, but Hillary is just a frightening prospect. You've got the South
[03:16:21.200 --> 03:16:26.960]  China Sea situation with China saying that it's not afraid of a military confrontation once again.
[03:16:26.960 --> 03:16:32.320]  So she could exploit that. The country's going to be massively divided if she gets in.
[03:16:32.320 --> 03:16:34.880]  She could rally everyone around by using the old excuse of...
[03:16:34.880 --> 03:16:40.000]  Exactly. How are the Chinese going to act when she's on their payroll on record?
[03:16:40.720 --> 03:16:43.840]  Because Kenneth Starr was on the payroll the same group he never went after for that,
[03:16:43.840 --> 03:16:48.320]  special prosecutor. How are they going to act knowing that she's been basically a Communist
[03:16:48.320 --> 03:16:53.920]  Chinese agent for 20 years? Well, she's going to get protected by the media. So it's not even
[03:16:53.920 --> 03:16:59.440]  going to be a big issue. I mean, you've got the media flapping their guns about Trump tweeting a
[03:16:59.440 --> 03:17:04.080]  star in a Hillary Clinton meeting. By the way, that's one of the four or five stars they use
[03:17:04.080 --> 03:17:11.680]  when they say like discount on a box, a cereal box. Exactly. And so, well, it was seen on a
[03:17:11.680 --> 03:17:16.640]  white supremacist website. Well, you know, my videos are posted on white supremacist websites,
[03:17:16.640 --> 03:17:21.040]  but white supremacists and neo-Nazis are the prominent people who attack me.
[03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:25.680]  The point is that symbol, the way they did it orange like that or whatever, is the symbol
[03:17:25.680 --> 03:17:31.600]  that the police use everybody else's. It just means look here. Yeah, totally, totally innocent.
[03:17:31.600 --> 03:17:37.360]  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the country that executes gay people and throws them in prison,
[03:17:37.360 --> 03:17:43.600]  is funding 20% of Hillary Clinton's campaign. Nobody gives a damn about that. That's not
[03:17:43.600 --> 03:17:51.280]  offensive. What's offensive is a red star in a meme about Hillary Clinton. My God, I'm so offended.
[03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:56.560]  Well, it's amazing. It's absolutely amazing. And they're going to try these stunts over and over
[03:17:56.560 --> 03:18:01.120]  and over and over and over again. And you know, the left gets mad at us, put out this Ben Garrison
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:06.880]  deal. He exposed Bush, by the way, with I'm With Herb, the Grim Reaper with Hillary showing Syria,
[03:18:06.880 --> 03:18:12.400]  Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya. And they say, oh, you didn't care about Bush. Yes, we did. And we were
[03:18:12.400 --> 03:18:17.360]  against those wars. But even mainline historians say Hillary's far worse and Obama at launching a
[03:18:17.360 --> 03:18:21.280]  whole bunch of new wars. And they're financing anti-Christian groups that are killing hundreds
[03:18:21.280 --> 03:18:27.200]  of thousands of Christians. I mean, Bush didn't do that. Bush protected Christians in Iraq as bad
[03:18:27.200 --> 03:18:31.520]  as he is. It's like, why do you think she's out to get Christians like this? I just can't figure it
[03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:36.640]  out. Well, I mean, it's the policy of the administration that Syrian refugees they've
[03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:43.440]  brought in. It's literally, you know, 99.5% Muslim, even though Syria, if you were doing it on that
[03:18:43.440 --> 03:18:51.520]  basis, you know, around 10% would be Christian. It's closer to 20. So you've got the guy involved
[03:18:51.520 --> 03:18:57.520]  in the Istanbul bombing being a refugee protected by the EU. Now the US is importing these people.
[03:18:57.520 --> 03:19:03.600]  And they seem to be deliberately importing Muslims over Christians while refusing to even mention
[03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:08.800]  the term Islamic terrorism. So you know, by the way, I mean, if I see some guy in one of these
[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:12.800]  Santa Claus outfits refusing a blind person to ride, because they got up seeing eye dog,
[03:19:12.800 --> 03:19:16.320]  I'm gonna get mad at a certain point, you know, once we get enough Muslims in the country, they
[03:19:16.320 --> 03:19:22.160]  start blowing stuff up to make a submit to them. But again, the leftist hate America so much,
[03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:30.080]  they love it, man. God almighty, I can be spoiled brats, Paul. Well, you saw a video about America
[03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:33.760]  greatest country in history. It has been the greatest country in history doesn't mean we're not mad
[03:19:33.760 --> 03:19:37.600]  a bunch of stuff has gone on. But but but we don't just have it out for the country.
[03:19:38.800 --> 03:19:44.720]  No, and all these people that hate it, man, get your asses out. Get the hell out. I'm sorry.
[03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:50.560]  I mean, I think one more slack jawed, white, yuppie 25 year old with a thousand dollar,
[03:19:50.560 --> 03:19:56.400]  you know, fancy iPhone pulling up in a fancy car, their parents gave them in a Mercedes,
[03:19:56.400 --> 03:20:01.600]  wearing a Bernie Sanders shirt. I mean, I just I just cannot handle it, man. You know how many
[03:20:01.600 --> 03:20:06.320]  people I see driving around in fancy cars with Bernie Sanders stickers, Paul? I mean, I have
[03:20:06.320 --> 03:20:12.720]  had it with the communist countries and socialist countries can't even manufacture cars, dumbass.
[03:20:12.720 --> 03:20:18.720]  Look at Cuba, dumbass. They can't make a car, you stupid idiots. Look at North Korea. Sorry,
[03:20:18.720 --> 03:20:24.240]  Paul, go ahead. Look at Venezuela, they have to have signs on the truck saying there's no food
[03:20:24.240 --> 03:20:29.920]  in it. So it doesn't get looted. I mean, fantastic, again, benefits of socialism. But the left is
[03:20:29.920 --> 03:20:35.840]  aligned with Islamists, because as you said, they both hate America. This is not just a cliche. It's
[03:20:35.840 --> 03:20:41.920]  true. This is why ISIS in its own manifestos say that we're going to go out and higher leftists
[03:20:41.920 --> 03:20:48.160]  radicalize them and give them weapons, because we broadly share the same goal. And that goal is to
[03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:53.840]  tear down the existing structure. Whether it's good or bad, it's to tear down the status quo.
[03:20:53.840 --> 03:20:58.640]  That means your constitutional rights in the process. And I got news for you. The only structure
[03:20:58.640 --> 03:21:03.680]  that works is free market dummies. We lose this, the carrying capacity falls. We're going to have
[03:21:03.680 --> 03:21:10.400]  billions of starved as morons. That's what they want to remove. It goes back to the Frankfurt
[03:21:10.400 --> 03:21:15.920]  School, which of course created political correctness. It goes back to Marxism. It goes back to this idea
[03:21:15.920 --> 03:21:22.160]  of critical theory and Saul Alinsky, where they just want to tear down absolutely everything
[03:21:22.160 --> 03:21:27.360]  in this kind of nihilist purge. And socialists want to do that. So do Islamists. That's why
[03:21:27.360 --> 03:21:33.280]  they feed off of each other. That's why socialists and liberals defend Islamists, because again,
[03:21:33.280 --> 03:21:38.880]  they broadly share the same goals. And now ISIS has actually recognized this and is going out and
[03:21:38.880 --> 03:21:43.680]  trying to hire these people. Wow. I knew that was, well, there's the headline. ISIS admits alliance
[03:21:43.680 --> 03:21:49.840]  with the left. Wow. Is there a story on this? This is sensational. Yeah. I mean, I wrote the story
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:56.240]  months ago. People need to know this because I'm telling you, man, here's the deal. Disliking
[03:21:56.240 --> 03:22:02.240]  problems in America and crony capitalism is good and should be done. But I'm telling you,
[03:22:02.240 --> 03:22:07.040]  socialists and globalists are going to deliver us into hell. They are not the answer to reforming
[03:22:07.040 --> 03:22:15.280]  the West even more. We want to get better, not go back to this. No, exactly. And the other issue
[03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:20.400]  with this election coming up again, they could get some radical leftists. We've already seen
[03:22:20.400 --> 03:22:26.480]  people jumping up on the stage trying to attack Trump. We've seen an assassination attempt against
[03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:32.240]  Trump just a few weeks ago, got barely any media attention whatsoever. This guy tries to grab an
[03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:38.560]  officer's gun, go up and shoot Trump in the head. The story was buried within 48 hours. If someone
[03:22:38.560 --> 03:22:43.280]  did that, you know, a Hillary event, it would be in the news for three weeks. Dangerous right-wing,
[03:22:43.280 --> 03:22:49.840]  radical Republicans trying to kill Hillary Clinton. Trump has had numerous assassination
[03:22:49.840 --> 03:22:53.760]  attempts. That's why he wears a bulletproof vest at every public event. That's why he doesn't
[03:22:53.760 --> 03:22:59.760]  button his suit top up. And again, the media doesn't talk about it. The other issue that's
[03:22:59.760 --> 03:23:04.720]  bubbling under the surface, which I'm going to write an article about, is Facebook, there's now
[03:23:04.720 --> 03:23:10.240]  speculation from experts that Facebook is going to manipulate their feed, their algorithm on the
[03:23:10.240 --> 03:23:16.080]  day of the election to encourage certain people within democratic districts to go out and vote.
[03:23:16.080 --> 03:23:21.920]  Because of course, if there's a low turnout, they need to encourage that. They're now powerful
[03:23:21.920 --> 03:23:26.800]  enough, and we've covered the stories before. Facebook has done tests, studies, experiments
[03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:32.720]  on the general public to manipulate their emotions. Facebook is now more powerful than
[03:23:32.720 --> 03:23:36.400]  a lot of countries, even in the Western world. And Zuckerberg is the dictator of it.
[03:23:36.400 --> 03:23:41.840]  And they're talking about using that algorithm to manipulate people on the day of the presidential
[03:23:41.840 --> 03:23:47.440]  election to go out and vote for Hillary Clinton. This is not me saying it. This is a top author
[03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:49.680]  and expert. So we're going to have that story coming up.
[03:23:49.680 --> 03:23:53.200]  All right. I want to go to two calls. I've been holding super long to hand the baton to you,
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:59.280]  Paul Watson. All I can say is, folks, you want to be part of history. Spread the video and audio
[03:23:59.280 --> 03:24:05.120]  links today. Spread the link to infowars.com forward slash show. Support our local stations.
[03:24:05.120 --> 03:24:09.280]  Thank them for carrying the show. It's your support that ends up getting us moving from the weekend
[03:24:09.280 --> 03:24:12.880]  to weeknights to live. Most stations end up moving us to live because they get the support,
[03:24:12.880 --> 03:24:17.440]  the ratings and things they need. We're winning in the info war. The globalists want to overthrow
[03:24:17.440 --> 03:24:22.240]  that because they can't beat us fair and square. So don't take the show for granted. I tell myself
[03:24:22.240 --> 03:24:27.280]  that every night when I go to bed, every day when I get up, work hard today, be as absolutely hard
[03:24:27.280 --> 03:24:32.880]  core as you can, bust your ass, Jones. Don't play games. This is history. You're betting your life,
[03:24:32.880 --> 03:24:38.160]  your treasure, your sacred honor on this. You better kick butt. Okay. I mean, I am in my face
[03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:43.040]  every day like a drill sergeant. And all I'm asking you is to realize this is history happening right
[03:24:43.040 --> 03:24:47.440]  now. This isn't a game. And we will beat these people as our ancestors have beaten parasites
[03:24:47.440 --> 03:24:53.760]  and collectivists before, but it's going to be rough. And we don't fight hard, folks. It's going to
[03:24:53.760 --> 03:24:57.840]  get really bad for it. It's better because they'll always destroy themselves in the end. But my God
[03:24:57.840 --> 03:25:01.520]  with the weapons we've got and things like that now, we do not want to go down this road. This is
[03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:05.840]  historic. This is dangerous. That we're winning major battles. We're starting to win the war.
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:11.600]  Look at the British situation and the Brexit. All I'm saying is spread the word about the broadcast
[03:25:11.600 --> 03:25:16.320]  today. Send those links out. The power of you, the activists of this transmission,
[03:25:16.320 --> 03:25:20.080]  you're the reason it's spreading so fast already. And the great team we've got, it works together
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:26.880]  like a horse in carriage, but you are 99% of the power. We're just the detonator. You are the explosive.
[03:25:26.880 --> 03:25:34.400]  Info wars is the detonator. You are the explosive. And then you're also the detonator to detonate the
[03:25:34.400 --> 03:25:39.920]  explosive in your area. So you're the explosive and the detonator. You are everything. And we need
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:44.560]  you to detonate information warfare weapons of truth in your area. People are ready to hear
[03:25:44.560 --> 03:25:48.880]  the truth. We need you to detonate. If you're an engineer and have the skills and there's no local
[03:25:48.880 --> 03:25:57.280]  affiliate, micro FM, AM, UHF, VHF, don't play games, whatever you got to do, folks. We're not
[03:25:57.280 --> 03:26:02.800]  playing around. We got to get hardcore. I launched a movement of micro FM is back in the mid nineties
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:10.400]  that I know that thousands of stations put up. So we're ready. We're ready to fight the info war
[03:26:10.400 --> 03:26:14.800]  because that's affecting the future battle space. That's almost all of war today. The Pentagon says
[03:26:14.800 --> 03:26:19.600]  it's informational. The average person at the Pentagon is awake, rooting for us, but commanded
[03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:26.560]  by enemy globalist. Literally. This is historic. What's happening? You are the resistance. That
[03:26:26.560 --> 03:26:31.920]  isn't some rhetoric, you know, like, Oh, I'm the resistance, you know, you're beginning to see this
[03:26:31.920 --> 03:26:36.400]  is real. When I say from deep behind enemy lines and occupied North America, I'm not playing around.
[03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:40.480]  Lana in North Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air with Paul Watson and myself. Go ahead.
[03:26:40.480 --> 03:26:50.160]  Hey, Alex, such a privilege to talk to you and I love all journalists and I forward all of your
[03:26:50.160 --> 03:26:59.200]  article on Instagram and I tell people about tragedy and hope 101. But what I wanted to ask you,
[03:26:59.200 --> 03:27:06.080]  you and your journalists were touching on it a minute ago. It's so stupid for the globalist
[03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:11.120]  to tear us down and another really smart. But what I don't understand is why are they doing that?
[03:27:11.120 --> 03:27:16.880]  Because once they do that, they're not going to have anybody to buy all of their luxury items
[03:27:16.880 --> 03:27:21.520]  like their BMW. Sure, sure. That's only one division of what they've done. It's a great point.
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:26.960]  This is the key to everything we've just asked. They have bad will towards you. Elites don't
[03:27:26.960 --> 03:27:30.480]  like even they're worth $100 billion. They don't like you with a nice swimming pool,
[03:27:30.480 --> 03:27:34.480]  going on nice vacations. They go to the Grand Canyon and see you there. They write books about it
[03:27:34.480 --> 03:27:39.040]  and complain why they're all these proletariats out here. They've got two high standard of living.
[03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:44.720]  So Obama says you can't have an air conditioning or a car. They don't want nice things for themselves.
[03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:48.880]  They want to restrict things to you. They want control. They're control freaks.
[03:27:49.600 --> 03:27:54.320]  And so they're trying to get all of the... And there's an extremism to commercialism and stuff.
[03:27:54.320 --> 03:27:59.840]  They use that to control people. They hit it from both angles. They're destroying it while they build
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:05.360]  it. But they're trying to basically phase all that out now and have a post-industrial world.
[03:28:05.360 --> 03:28:10.560]  Paul, can you speak to that paradox? Yeah, well, I mean, you saw it with the Brexit result.
[03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:16.800]  The people in London, the middle classes who want to be elitists, they all rally around the elitists.
[03:28:16.800 --> 03:28:22.080]  The elitists have their low income servants that drag everybody else's wages down.
[03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:26.960]  And it's to hell with the rest of the country. The vast majority of people who voted for Brexit
[03:28:26.960 --> 03:28:33.760]  were outside of London. The people of London 30 to 70% voted for it. So it's this city-centric view
[03:28:33.760 --> 03:28:39.360]  where as long as they have this support network of marginally middle-class people who just want
[03:28:39.360 --> 03:28:43.760]  to be part of the establishment, that's why they support it. And then these low income, basically,
[03:28:43.760 --> 03:28:48.320]  slaves who do all the work for them, they're happy with that. And it's to hell with everybody else.
[03:28:48.320 --> 03:28:53.520]  In a free market capitalist system, everybody benefits. The whole country benefits. The wealth
[03:28:53.520 --> 03:28:57.360]  isn't sucked into a few major cities. That's right. That's right. The elites can't handle an open free
[03:28:57.360 --> 03:29:01.760]  society based on free will and a free association because they can't create a global dictatorship.
[03:29:01.760 --> 03:29:06.160]  They want a technocracy where they get the life extension technologies and everything with themselves
[03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:10.880]  and we don't get any of it. They're worried about us getting next level technologies that will free
[03:29:10.880 --> 03:29:15.440]  everyone. Okay? And because once we get off the planet, their monopoly's over. Okay? So they're
[03:29:15.440 --> 03:29:19.760]  literally trying to control the future. This is a total power grab of the entire species.
[03:29:19.760 --> 03:29:26.880]  Does that make sense? If you're Kim Jong-un or if you're in his staff and you live in Pyongyang,
[03:29:26.880 --> 03:29:31.840]  then you've got a very high quality of life. Meanwhile, half a mile away, there are people
[03:29:31.840 --> 03:29:37.280]  starving on the streets. They're perfectly happy for the world to be like that. They do it on purpose.
[03:29:38.080 --> 03:29:41.920]  They don't produce cars because they don't want you to know they even hardly exist.
[03:29:41.920 --> 03:29:45.840]  Thank you, Lonnie. The Stormy can get a call from Paul, but I'm handing the baton to Paul Watson.
[03:29:45.840 --> 03:29:50.800]  Support the broadcast. Spread the word. The war is now. Spread the word now. The
[03:29:50.800 --> 03:29:54.320]  revolution against tyranny is now. Great job, crew.
[03:30:00.560 --> 03:30:06.560]  The demand for pain-ray weapons grows over fears of civil unrest. According to a new
[03:30:06.560 --> 03:30:11.920]  research study, the market for directed energy weapons is expected to grow at the highest rate
[03:30:11.920 --> 03:30:17.520]  during the forecast period thanks for their use in controlling riots and cross-border trespassing.
[03:30:17.520 --> 03:30:23.600]  The global riot control system market is estimated to grow from $9 billion in 2016
[03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:30.880]  to $11.78 billion by 2021 as a result of increasing political disputes and civil unrest,
[03:30:30.880 --> 03:30:35.600]  militarization of law enforcement agencies, stringent environmental and governmental
[03:30:35.600 --> 03:30:40.880]  regulations, and declining defense budgets of developed economies states the report.
[03:30:40.880 --> 03:30:46.560]  So-called pain-rays or active denial systems work by blasting controlled microwaves into a
[03:30:46.560 --> 03:30:52.000]  crowd of people, creating an unbearably hot sensation that forces them to flee the scene.

[03:31:03.840 --> 03:31:08.800]  joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brainforce did.
[03:31:08.800 --> 03:31:14.160]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30.
[03:31:14.160 --> 03:31:17.920]  I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really
[03:31:17.920 --> 03:31:21.360]  wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brainforce right there,
[03:31:21.360 --> 03:31:26.560]  popped two of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[03:31:26.560 --> 03:31:31.600]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party

[03:31:36.400 --> 03:31:40.560]  based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a
[03:31:40.560 --> 03:31:44.880]  while, but I probably could not have done it without brainforce. I went home about 6.45 this
[03:31:44.880 --> 03:31:50.160]  morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce and came in. You will find

[03:33:02.080 --> 03:33:08.720]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN radio network.
[03:33:13.840 --> 03:33:17.760]  We are back on the fourth hour live overdrive of the Alex Jones show with me, your host,
[03:33:17.760 --> 03:33:23.040]  Paul Joseph Watson. We're going to get to some other news from Europe in a little while because
[03:33:23.040 --> 03:33:30.240]  obviously, Alex has covered this Hillary Clinton email scandal. Fallout, basically, many pundits,
[03:33:30.240 --> 03:33:37.600]  many commentators are saying that this is the most breathtaking fix in American political history.
[03:33:37.600 --> 03:33:45.520]  You had the FBI Director Comey get up there, lay out in detail in a 15-20 minute disquisition
[03:33:45.520 --> 03:33:53.440]  how Hillary Clinton broke the law, only to conclude that Hillary Clinton is above the law.
[03:33:54.080 --> 03:34:01.440]  Period. Final confirmation, as if it were needed, that America is a banana republic.
[03:34:02.480 --> 03:34:07.840]  And the outrage, the reaction, the backlash from this continues. Here's some of the feedback that
[03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:13.200]  we've seen. Here's Dinesh De Souza. If reports are accurate that James Comey won't indict,
[03:34:13.200 --> 03:34:17.920]  which, of course, it turned out they were, how that will encourage these Clinton gangsters to
[03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:24.800]  continue their crime spree. And that's the point, isn't it? This is only going to embolden the
[03:34:24.800 --> 03:34:32.720]  Clinton crime family. We saw the sheer chutzpah, the brazen arrogance of Bill Clinton meeting with
[03:34:32.720 --> 03:34:38.480]  Loretta Lynch on the tarmac there at Phoenix Airport. And again, many commentators said,
[03:34:38.480 --> 03:34:44.080]  why did he do that? Well, because he could, because he's a gangster, he's a criminal,
[03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:50.320]  and he's not afraid to show it. Again, meeting with Loretta Lynch, the person responsible
[03:34:50.320 --> 03:34:55.680]  for investigating Hillary Clinton, but they just talked about golf and grandchildren,
[03:34:55.680 --> 03:35:00.240]  and you can trust them. Then Hillary Clinton afterwards saying, oh yeah, Loretta Lynch
[03:35:00.960 --> 03:35:08.240]  may have a place within my future administration. Again, the absolute brazen chutzpah
[03:35:08.240 --> 03:35:14.000]  of merely suggesting that when she's the person, even though she half recused herself,
[03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:18.480]  he was going to have the final say on this indictment. Now, of course, Comey has come out
[03:35:18.480 --> 03:35:23.360]  and taken the fall, whether he was threatened or not. Some people are speculating he was.
[03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:29.840]  But again, that takes the heat off Loretta Lynch. Now, everybody's expecting it to come to nothing.
[03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:37.520]  She can quietly slip into the Hillary White House. No questions asked. Absolutely breathtaking.
[03:35:37.520 --> 03:35:43.440]  Here's some more reaction. Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary. If Hillary were
[03:35:43.440 --> 03:35:49.200]  still secretary of state, President Obama would have to fire her. But instead, he travels with her
[03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:57.680]  and seeks to promote her. Disgusting. So again, the timing. Obama immediately after this Comey
[03:35:57.680 --> 03:36:04.560]  press conference is on the campaign trail with Hillary Clinton. The timing is absolutely perfect.
[03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:10.720]  Here's Jan Brewer, former Arizona governor. What I got from FBI Director Comey's remarks.
[03:36:11.360 --> 03:36:17.760]  Hillary Clinton's recklessness makes her unfit to be president. And again, you've had Hillary Clinton
[03:36:17.760 --> 03:36:23.680]  on the campaign trail constantly invoke this narrative that Donald Trump is reckless with
[03:36:23.680 --> 03:36:31.920]  national security. After she's mishandling these national security issues on a daily basis with
[03:36:31.920 --> 03:36:39.200]  her email, that point now is completely null and void. And this is what may play in Trump's favor
[03:36:39.200 --> 03:36:44.320]  as we go forward, despite the fact that Hillary's not going to be indicted. The sheer amount of
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:51.040]  material that came out of this Comey press conference today is Trump is going to run on
[03:36:51.040 --> 03:36:55.680]  that for months and months to come. Let's go to this Fox News clip on that subject,
[03:36:55.680 --> 03:37:02.560]  analyzing how this will affect the presidential race with Republican strategist Brad Blakeman.
[03:37:02.560 --> 03:37:13.360]  Here's the clip. So first of all, I believe that interview was on the phone, obviously,
[03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:21.200]  and only five minutes was allowed, which I think at this point that that is like everything here.
[03:37:21.200 --> 03:37:27.040]  It seems very concocted to protect her. And boy, would I like her to be doing well right now,
[03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:32.240]  but Mark Halperin, tell me what you see in this. Are they trying to move this along?
[03:37:38.720 --> 03:37:43.840]  Yeah, we need to go to the Fox News clip. This is Republican strategist Brad Blakeman. Let me
[03:37:43.840 --> 03:37:48.800]  know if you have that clip, because he's talking about how this will affect Trump, how Trump will
[03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:54.480]  be able to exploit this, how it will change the conversation. We'll go to that clip soon anyway.
[03:37:55.040 --> 03:37:59.920]  More feedback though, more remarks coming out as a result of this non-indictment of Hillary
[03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:06.720]  Clinton. This is Sean Parnell, co-founder of American Warrior Initiative. He says it's official.
[03:38:06.720 --> 03:38:12.080]  We're a banana republic, one where high ranking officials aren't subject to the law.
[03:38:12.080 --> 03:38:19.360]  Harry Shearer, again, by no means a right-wing Republican. He's a left-winger. He says there's
[03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:25.840]  a great recommendation for president, quote, extremely careless. And again, that's what
[03:38:25.840 --> 03:38:33.120]  FBI Director Comey said that she was, quote, extremely careless with national security
[03:38:33.680 --> 03:38:41.600]  material. In eight cases, top secret classified material, she was, quote, extremely careless.
[03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:49.680]  And yet somehow that doesn't equate to negligence. We talk about precedent. I mean, Comey alluded
[03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:54.720]  to it. He said, listen, some people in the past, some people in the future, to paraphrase him,
[03:38:54.720 --> 03:38:59.120]  you know, they will face punishment for the exact same thing that Hillary Clinton did.
[03:38:59.760 --> 03:39:04.880]  But Hillary Clinton won't. What's the only determination? What's the only conclusion you
[03:39:04.880 --> 03:39:09.760]  can draw for that? Well, it's the fact that Hillary Clinton is above the law. But we go
[03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:16.480]  back to December 1996. John Deutch resigned from the FBI after it was discovered that he had stored
[03:39:16.480 --> 03:39:21.360]  highly classified documents on his home computer, which was connected to the Internet. After a
[03:39:21.360 --> 03:39:28.000]  criminal investigation, Deutch agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $5,000 fine.
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:33.680]  But wait for it. How did he get off? Before the prosecutors could file the papers in federal court,
[03:39:33.680 --> 03:39:40.880]  President Bill Clinton pardoned him on his last day in office. So again, the exact same scenario,
[03:39:40.880 --> 03:39:48.480]  mishandling classified documents on his home computer. He was guilty. He had to plead guilty
[03:39:48.480 --> 03:39:54.240]  to a misdemeanor and pay a $5,000 fine. He was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.
[03:39:55.200 --> 03:40:01.040]  David Petraeus. Again, this is an ABC News report from when this happened. Petraeus has
[03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:05.600]  entered into an agreement with federal prosecutors in which he would plead guilty
[03:40:05.600 --> 03:40:12.800]  to a misdemeanor charge for mishandling classified information. The charge, unauthorized removal
[03:40:12.800 --> 03:40:18.240]  and retention of classified material stems in part from documents the former director allegedly
[03:40:18.240 --> 03:40:25.120]  provided to his mistress. So again, in fact, he was up for a higher degree charge before he
[03:40:25.120 --> 03:40:32.240]  plead guilty to a misdemeanor. The fact is that he had to plead guilty because he was mishandling
[03:40:32.240 --> 03:40:39.680]  classified information. Here's another example. This is on the FBI's own website.
[03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:46.960]  From less than a year ago, July 29, 2015, Folsom Naval Reservist is sentenced
[03:40:47.600 --> 03:40:52.000]  after pleading guilty to unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials.
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:59.040]  This is Brian H. Nishimura, who pleaded guilty to unauthorized removal and retention of classified
[03:40:59.040 --> 03:41:06.400]  materials. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman immediately sentenced Nishimura to two years
[03:41:06.400 --> 03:41:13.760]  of probation for $7,500 fine and forfeiture of personal media containing classified materials.
[03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:19.280]  Nishimura was further ordered to surrender any currently held security clearance and to never
[03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:26.640]  again seek such a clearance. So his security clearance was completely revoked. He could never
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:31.200]  seek it again. And yet, Hillary Clinton, who did exactly the same thing, is going to have
[03:41:31.200 --> 03:41:37.760]  the highest security clearance imaginable for that position if she becomes president. Again,
[03:41:37.760 --> 03:41:44.400]  this article from the FBI's own website, Sacramento Division continues. According to court
[03:41:44.400 --> 03:41:49.920]  documents, Nishimura was a Naval Reservist deployed in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008.
[03:41:50.880 --> 03:41:55.840]  In his role as a regional engineer for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Nishimura had access
[03:41:55.840 --> 03:42:02.320]  to classified briefings and digital records that could only be retained and viewed on
[03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:08.320]  authorized government computers. Nishimura, however, caused the materials to be downloaded
[03:42:08.320 --> 03:42:15.200]  and stored on his personal, unclassified electronic devices and storage media.
[03:42:15.200 --> 03:42:21.360]  He carried such classified materials on his unauthorized media when he traveled off base
[03:42:21.360 --> 03:42:26.080]  in Afghanistan and ultimately carried those materials back to the United States at the
[03:42:26.080 --> 03:42:33.520]  end of his deployment, just as Hillary Clinton was sending those emails when she was in Russia
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:42.480]  and China. So you see, again, in this case, it was not a deliberate intent to give out
[03:42:42.480 --> 03:42:48.240]  classified materials to hostile powers, to foreign powers or hostile agents. It was merely
[03:42:48.240 --> 03:42:54.960]  the fact that he mishandled the classified information. He was sentenced $7,500 fine,
[03:42:54.960 --> 03:43:04.240]  two years of probation, the exact same scenario, but his last name was not Clinton.
[03:43:05.760 --> 03:43:12.240]  And that's the standard right now for being above the law. Now, let's get into the law
[03:43:12.240 --> 03:43:18.880]  a little bit more. In fact, I think we've got that clip now. Again, this is a Republican strategist,
[03:43:18.880 --> 03:43:26.560]  Brad Blakeman, on Fox News, talking about how this fallout will affect the presidential election.
[03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:34.000]  Here's that clip. Some quotes, Brad, from the FBI Director's statements. There is evidence they,
[03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:39.520]  meaning Hillary and her staff, were extremely careless in their handling of classified info.
[03:43:39.520 --> 03:43:43.680]  There is evidence that any reasonable person in Clinton's position should have known
[03:43:43.680 --> 03:43:50.640]  that an unclassified system was no place for that information. Pretty damning words for the
[03:43:51.440 --> 03:43:54.400]  person who wants to be the next president of the United States.
[03:43:54.960 --> 03:43:59.360]  There's no doubt about it. This may be a victory for Hillary Clinton, but it's a defeat for American
[03:43:59.360 --> 03:44:04.800]  justice. One thing is for sure, John, while Hillary may never be tried in a court of law,
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:08.400]  she is going to be tried in the court of public opinion, and it's going to be up to Donald
[03:44:08.400 --> 03:44:12.560]  Trump to be the prosecutor. The American people are going to be the jury. The electorate is going
[03:44:12.560 --> 03:44:17.680]  to determine whether or not Hillary Clinton is capable of being the president of the United States
[03:44:17.680 --> 03:44:22.720]  in view of her recklessness with regard to the handling and dissemination of the most sensitive
[03:44:22.720 --> 03:44:27.040]  American secrets. Anybody else but Hillary Clinton would have been indicted. There's no question
[03:44:27.040 --> 03:44:32.160]  about it. Because she's Hillary Clinton, she got a pass. The question is, will the American people
[03:44:32.160 --> 03:44:38.880]  give her one too? And that's the point, isn't it? Will this beef the crooked Hillary meme even more
[03:44:38.880 --> 03:44:46.000]  in a year, 2016, which has seen a complete revolt against the status quo, especially after the
[03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:53.600]  Brexit vote? Can Trump play on those concerns? Will this beef the view? Will this beef the narrative
[03:44:54.240 --> 03:44:58.400]  that things are completely out of control, that Hillary Clinton is above the law,
[03:44:58.400 --> 03:45:05.680]  that she represents this establishment that's so hated? She's trying to back away from that image
[03:45:05.680 --> 03:45:11.360]  now by saying she won't support TPP and things like this because she knows that that is toxic
[03:45:11.920 --> 03:45:18.240]  to be associated with this discredited establishment. So this could backfire on Hillary,
[03:45:18.240 --> 03:45:24.560]  despite the fact that it's a victory right now. Trump is going to get a lot of gas mileage
[03:45:24.560 --> 03:45:30.880]  out of this scandal because, again, he's going to make the point that crooked Hillary was protected
[03:45:30.880 --> 03:45:37.680]  by an administration by a federal government that has placed her above the law. This is Guy
[03:45:37.680 --> 03:45:44.720]  Benson, town hall political editor. She mishandled top secret classified material in an extremely
[03:45:44.720 --> 03:45:51.440]  careless manner, which is not grossly negligent, apparently. Again, as I said, they laid out the
[03:45:51.440 --> 03:45:56.080]  fact that it was extremely careless. She broke the law and we're going to go through the law in
[03:45:56.080 --> 03:46:03.440]  a second. But somehow that doesn't equate to gross negligence, brazenly telling the American people
[03:46:03.440 --> 03:46:09.200]  that Hillary Clinton is above the law. Now, there's a Ben Shapiro article on Daily Wire.
[03:46:09.200 --> 03:46:16.080]  It's FBI. Yes, Queen Hillary broke the law. No, she won't be prosecuted. And this really drills
[03:46:16.080 --> 03:46:23.360]  down, gets into the specific laws that have been broken. On July 4th, 1776, the United States announced
[03:46:23.360 --> 03:46:30.720]  its independence from Great Britain based on the key principle of rule of law. On July 5th, 2016,
[03:46:30.720 --> 03:46:37.680]  the United States said, eff it, I'm with Hillary. Just days after the Attorney General of the United
[03:46:37.680 --> 03:46:42.480]  States, Loretta Lynch held a secret meeting aboard a plane with former President Bill Clinton,
[03:46:42.480 --> 03:46:48.240]  whose wife was under an FBI investigation. Just the day after Hillary leaked that she'd
[03:46:48.240 --> 03:46:54.560]  want Lynch for her own administration, just hours after the president of the United States, Barack
[03:46:54.560 --> 03:47:01.520]  Obama, flew Hillary, still under FBI investigation down to North Carolina on Air Force One, and just
[03:47:01.520 --> 03:47:08.080]  two hours before Obama was to open his campaign on behalf of Hillary Clinton, FBI Director James
[03:47:08.080 --> 03:47:14.000]  Comey announced that while Hillary Clinton had clearly engaged in criminal activity worthy of
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:21.680]  prosecution, he had recommended that she not be prosecuted because of course he did. Here are
[03:47:21.680 --> 03:47:27.520]  Comey's findings which demonstrate full violation of multiple provisions of federal law. And you
[03:47:27.520 --> 03:47:34.000]  can go through this article and read them for yourself. So Hillary lied. She lied that she
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:38.640]  never transmitted classified information. She lied that she only used the private server because
[03:47:38.640 --> 03:47:43.600]  she wanted one device. She lied that the State Department allowed her to gerry rig this
[03:47:43.600 --> 03:47:50.080]  technological setup. She lied that the emails were never breached. But according to Comey,
[03:47:50.800 --> 03:47:57.200]  no biggie. Now Comey essentially admitted that Hillary violated federal law. And here's his
[03:47:57.200 --> 03:48:02.400]  quote. Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence classified information was improperly
[03:48:02.400 --> 03:48:08.800]  stored or transmitted on that personal system in violation of a federal statute, making it a felony
[03:48:08.800 --> 03:48:14.960]  to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way,
[03:48:14.960 --> 03:48:21.680]  or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from
[03:48:21.680 --> 03:48:26.960]  appropriate systems or storage facilities. And Comey stated that the FBI had quote,
[03:48:26.960 --> 03:48:32.400]  investigated to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in connection
[03:48:32.400 --> 03:48:38.800]  with the personal email server by any foreign power or other hostile actors. Now remember,
[03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:47.120]  Guccifer, the Romanian hacker, said, went on record, he's now in a prison, that he personally
[03:48:47.120 --> 03:48:52.640]  hacked into Hillary Clinton's email server. But of course, Comey said that because there was no
[03:48:52.640 --> 03:48:59.520]  trace that they couldn't go after her on that basis. Of course, you're not going to leave a trace
[03:48:59.520 --> 03:49:04.960]  via the method that he said he did it. How he did it on previous occasions hacked into other
[03:49:04.960 --> 03:49:12.640]  people's emails accounts. He simply guessed the password. So there was no actual hostile attempt
[03:49:12.640 --> 03:49:17.280]  to hack into the server. There was no trace left because he merely guessed the password.
[03:49:17.920 --> 03:49:22.720]  He publicly said he did the same went through the same process with Hillary Clinton's private
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:29.840]  email server. But again, Comey didn't even mention that. The article continues, but no matter,
[03:49:29.840 --> 03:49:35.200]  the law doesn't apply to Hillary Clinton. As Comey said, quote, to be clear, this is not to
[03:49:35.200 --> 03:49:39.120]  suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no
[03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:44.160]  consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative
[03:49:44.160 --> 03:49:49.920]  sanctions. But that is not what we're deciding now. And as I laid out with the three previous
[03:49:49.920 --> 03:49:56.880]  examples, and there are many more, they not only faced administrative actions, they faced in one
[03:49:56.880 --> 03:50:02.640]  case two years probation. Again, the soldier out of Afghanistan who I talked about Nishimora,
[03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:09.680]  again, mishandling classified information, downloading it onto his own personal device,
[03:50:10.720 --> 03:50:17.520]  transporting it around exactly as Hillary Clinton did. He was hit with a $7,500 fine
[03:50:17.520 --> 03:50:24.720]  and two years probation. David Petraeus, similar circumstances, a douche, the former FBI director,
[03:50:24.720 --> 03:50:29.360]  similar circumstances, he got pardoned from Clinton. But again, they were punished.
[03:50:30.480 --> 03:50:36.480]  So Comey's right when he says, you know, other people under similar circumstances were punished
[03:50:37.680 --> 03:50:44.240]  in the past and will be in the future, but not Hillary Clinton. What else are we to conclude
[03:50:44.240 --> 03:50:51.200]  from that other than the fact that Hillary Clinton is above the law and the United States is a banana
[03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:56.640]  republic? We'll be back with the final segment of the Alex Jones show live covering news from
[03:50:56.640 --> 03:51:02.080]  Europe after the break breaking news at info wars.com. Don't go away. My name is Don Whisken.
[03:51:02.080 --> 03:51:08.800]  In 1994, I lost my 62 year old father to complications of bypass surgery. In 1977,
[03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:13.120]  my 44 year old brother was found dead in his apartment. He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:13.120 --> 03:51:18.080]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed. 21 days later,
[03:51:18.080 --> 03:51:23.120]  my 53 year old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital. He waited too long.
[03:51:23.120 --> 03:51:29.120]  In June that same year, I almost joined them at 42. What did I do? I took a seven herb formula I
[03:51:29.120 --> 03:51:34.080]  now call Extendivite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginko, buloba, hawthorn, milk, thistle,

[03:54:17.920 --> 03:54:24.800]  Now, ISIS members are once again bragging about how they can exploit Europe's borders,
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:30.080]  which are basically like sips right now. This is out of politico.eu, man in the hat claims
[03:54:30.080 --> 03:54:35.520]  terror cells in Paris and Brussels, part of larger network. And one of the ISIS terrorists,
[03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:41.040]  they quote in the article, said that the terror cell moved freely through Europe. He said, quote,
[03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:46.000]  you know, an international arrest warrant to be sought by the police, that doesn't change anything.
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:52.640]  I passed every day in front of soldiers, policemen, not with a covered face, but with a cap. He added,
[03:54:52.640 --> 03:54:56.960]  quote, security at the borders can never protect anyone. It's just the politicians who want to
[03:54:56.960 --> 03:55:04.160]  delude people that they protect them. But there is usually no security. It has never been real.
[03:55:04.160 --> 03:55:09.280]  And again, that is why ISIS in their own manifesto brags about how they exploited
[03:55:09.280 --> 03:55:16.800]  the refugee program to infiltrate jihadists into Europe. We saw another example of that with the
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:24.000]  Istanbul airport attack, where the mastermind was a refugee protected by the EU. He was being
[03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:29.840]  arrested with Kalashnikovs and explosives in his car in Sweden. They put him in jail for a year,
[03:55:29.840 --> 03:55:36.240]  because Sweden's a liberal basket case hellhole. Russia tried to extradite this guy on two separate
[03:55:36.240 --> 03:55:43.040]  occasions to charge him with terrorism. And the EU protected him because he was a precious refugee.
[03:55:43.040 --> 03:55:52.560]  Later becoming the mastermind of the bloody Istanbul airport attack. They're laughing at us
[03:55:52.560 --> 03:55:58.000]  every single day. They're laughing at us because we just invite them right on in.
[03:55:59.040 --> 03:56:04.800]  Now with regard to the Brexit, this is out sky news. Branson and May meet as tycoon demands new poll.
[03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:09.920]  So basically the favorite to become the next prime minister of the United Kingdom after the
[03:56:09.920 --> 03:56:17.200]  resignation of David Cameron is having secret meetings with Richard Branson, who is openly
[03:56:17.200 --> 03:56:22.960]  calling for democracy to be subverted and for there to be a second referendum on Brexit.
[03:56:23.520 --> 03:56:28.560]  So this supposedly conservative next prime minister who isn't conservative at all. She's a
[03:56:28.560 --> 03:56:34.240]  globalist. She's the one who said that Sharia law was good for women in the United Kingdom.
[03:56:34.240 --> 03:56:41.920]  Secretly meeting with a billionaire who wants to subvert democracy is another article from
[03:56:41.920 --> 03:56:49.280]  infowars.com. Dumb zombie Americans think the US is 2016 years old. Yes, they actually thought
[03:56:49.280 --> 03:56:56.720]  that Independence Day celebrating the birthday of America meant that America was 2016 years old,
[03:56:56.720 --> 03:57:04.960]  because it's the year 2016. Never underestimate the stupidity as a general public. And again,
[03:57:04.960 --> 03:57:09.200]  you saw it with a New Mark Dice video. They don't know how many stars are on the American flag.
[03:57:09.200 --> 03:57:14.400]  They don't know anything about US history, because now as a separate report notes,
[03:57:14.400 --> 03:57:22.960]  only 23 undergraduate history programs at 76 top universities require any type of US history course.
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:28.880]  But of course, many of them now require gender studies and all kinds of feminist identity
[03:57:28.880 --> 03:57:35.840]  politics social justice warrior crap. So that's why the general public continues to be completely
[03:57:35.840 --> 03:57:42.240]  misinformed. German police report confirmed surge in child rapes by migrants in swimming
[03:57:42.240 --> 03:57:48.400]  pools and admits we have grave cause for concern. Yes, this is the racist German government once
[03:57:48.400 --> 03:57:54.160]  again with their racist statistics. Here's a quote from the article talking about children
[03:57:54.160 --> 03:58:00.560]  being sexually abused at swimming pools by migrants, quote, the perpetrators are, for the most part,
[03:58:01.120 --> 03:58:08.160]  immigrants. That's the German government saying that it's not Pegida, it's not radical right wing
[03:58:08.160 --> 03:58:13.520]  racist. So what are you going to do when the facts continue to show this? Well, just denounce the
[03:58:13.520 --> 03:58:20.560]  facts as racist and again continue to import millions and millions of people who are completely
[03:58:20.560 --> 03:58:26.560]  incompatible with Western society and destroy the fabric of Western civilization.
[03:58:27.360 --> 03:58:31.360]  That's going to wrap it up for today's edition of the Alex Jones show in fours nightly news coming
[03:58:31.360 --> 03:58:36.480]  up. Alex will be back 11 to two tomorrow. Look out for that big Facebook rigging the election
[03:58:36.480 --> 03:58:48.880]  article on info wars.com. Thanks for joining us. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today.
