[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.675]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.257]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.257 --> 00:00:12.798]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:17.003]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:21.047]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:31.417]  It is Monday, the 9th day of August, 2010.
[00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:43.187]  We'll have Gerald Cilente coming up in the middle of the next hour for a full hour and a half with his monthly visit with us, the top trends forecaster out there on the face of the globe.
[00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:56.643]  He'll be joining us to break down the situation with Iran, the worsening economy, and to take your phone calls, joining us via video hookup via Skype from New York.
[00:00:56.643 --> 00:01:09.731]  Of course, we simulcast the entire three-hour radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv if you'd like to add another element of information to your listening information.
[00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:31.501]  We are going to be live here again, ladies and gentlemen, for the next three hours, and I want to go over the news first here today, and then we're going to open the phones up as well on this live Monday edition.
[00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:36.383]  Number one, Barry Sotero, aka Barack H. Obama,
[00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:41.140]  We'll be flying into Austin in the next few hours.
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.369]  They've already got much of the highway shut down, literally 200 yards or less from my office.
[00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.313]  And there are just police all over the streets of Austin.
[00:01:52.375 --> 00:02:00.081]  I guess to protect the imperial puppet and to give the illusion that the imperial puppet actually runs anything.
[00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:05.785]  The truth is the imperial puppet has the lowest approval rating of any president in modern U.S.
[00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:11.410]  history and it's got a long way to go in its downward slide to infamy.
[00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:21.477]  They built him up as the messianic leader who would fix all of our problems and of course he was there just to sucker the public and to stall them while world government was being established.
[00:02:22.798 --> 00:02:46.778]  We have a little little surprise for Barry Sitaro today here on the radio show and I'll announce that surprise at the start of the next hour and it'll be up at PrisonPlanet.com for everyone just to commemorate his visit to Austin, Texas and I was listening to local news radio 590 this morning and there's gonna be a big demonstration and
[00:02:47.698 --> 00:03:06.054]  Down at UT, he's going to first speak at a $5,000 a plate luncheon at High Noon at the Four Seasons on the river in downtown Austin, on the Colorado River, and then he will travel from there to UT's Gregory Gym at 2 p.m.
[00:03:06.054 --> 00:03:12.219]  today, causing street closures and traffic delays well into the afternoon.
[00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:22.442]  Of course Michelle is still enjoying her multi-million dollar taxpayer paid for party and they're closing the beaches and the rest of it.
[00:03:22.442 --> 00:03:23.303]  The media says it's
[00:03:24.423 --> 00:03:32.745]  Half a million bucks or so they're spending, but they're not counting Air Force Two and all the rest of the security, but that in itself is a distraction.
[00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:39.826]  The media is focusing in on Michelle Obama, the puppet First Lady, instead of the big bank stealing trillions.
[00:03:39.826 --> 00:03:49.148]  They'll focus in on Obama, who is their front man and meant to take the fall for all of their corruption, just like the Republican puppet, whether it's Mitt Romney or
[00:03:51.527 --> 00:04:19.120]  Many of the other Republicans that they've got lined up, like Sarah Palin, even if they were good people, which they're not, they're not going to be able to really change anything as president, but still they will take the blame for it, instead of the media focusing in on where the real solution lies, and that is at the state level, through nullification, taking our states back, that remedy the founders gave us in the 9th and 10th Amendment, to block the unconstitutional, criminal,
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.785]  Out of control usurpations of the federal government.
[00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:25.630]  So that is coming up today.
[00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.471]  We're going to get a break here in a moment.
[00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:31.532]  And when we come back, I will get into the economy.
[00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:33.773]  And boy, are there some big developments on that front.
[00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:37.554]  CNBC, we are in the equivalent of a Great Depression.
[00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:39.315]  That's the headline.
[00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:42.196]  We'll get into 86 days to decide.
[00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:46.558]  Activists say Tea Party impostors infiltrating elections.
[00:04:46.558 --> 00:04:51.880]  We'll get into more on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funding La Raza and Mecha and others.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.161]  We'll get into a bunch of news.
[00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:58.406]  Dealing with the Gulf oil spill and a lot more coming up today.
[00:04:58.406 --> 00:04:59.767]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:01.429]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:52.341]  Thank you!
[00:05:59.363 --> 00:06:03.906]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:04.827]  Number 1.
[00:06:04.827 --> 00:06:08.250]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.110]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.994]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:13.994 --> 00:06:14.734]  It's true.
[00:06:14.734 --> 00:06:19.618]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.618 --> 00:06:20.439]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:24.021]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:27.724]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:27.924 --> 00:06:28.724]  Number 4.
[00:06:28.724 --> 00:06:31.485]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.485 --> 00:06:35.165]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.165 --> 00:06:35.945]  Number 5.
[00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:40.106]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.106 --> 00:06:45.147]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.147 --> 00:06:49.328]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.328 --> 00:06:51.108]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.108 --> 00:06:55.709]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:59.051]  877-327-0365.
[00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:02.193]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:07:02.193 --> 00:07:05.975]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:08.856]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:07:08.856 --> 00:07:14.240]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.823]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:22.506]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[00:07:22.506 --> 00:07:25.849]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:27.831]  Try their new evacuation pack.
[00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:30.394]  A two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:07:30.394 --> 00:07:32.777]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[00:07:32.777 --> 00:07:38.503]  With open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:41.066]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:43.448]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:43.448 --> 00:07:51.297]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:51.297 --> 00:07:56.322]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[00:08:01.724 --> 00:08:08.370]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.352]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.952 --> 00:08:19.314]  It is Monday, the 9th day of August, 2010.
[00:08:19.314 --> 00:08:23.178]  Gerald Salente is coming up in about an hour and a half with us.
[00:08:23.178 --> 00:08:30.465]  He'll join us for more than an hour and we'll have open phones, always informative with his monthly visits.
[00:08:30.465 --> 00:08:31.907]  I'm also going to spend about 20-30 minutes with a
[00:08:35.606 --> 00:08:51.872]  I'm a member of Army Intelligence on the show because this person is specifically known to me and I had a chance to talk to him last week when we were doing some news reporting on what appears to be a FEMA camp going up at Fort Hood.
[00:08:51.872 --> 00:09:01.496]  We drove out there ourselves, went on the base last Friday and confirmed that the barbed wire is facing in at the Fort Hood Sports Stadium.
[00:09:02.356 --> 00:09:13.189]  They've put a fence up around it and a former park, and it has barbed wire facing in, and the military people we've talked to, not just this gentleman that we'll call Joseph, he wanted to use his real name.
[00:09:13.189 --> 00:09:20.997]  He says he's sick of it, he wants to go public, but he's known specifically by me, and I told him, no, we're not using your real name.
[00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:24.639]  I said, we'll call you Joseph.
[00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:33.006]  But he said that he's heard callers on the show when we've opened the phones up for military people to call, specifically from Fort Hood that he knows.
[00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:37.629]  And he was formerly a police officer before he got in the Army.
[00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:38.770]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:51.480]  But he was telling me some amazing stuff that we'd actually confirmed separately about the Joe Stack attack, the airplane being flown into the IRS building, about the Fort Hood shooter.
[00:09:54.235 --> 00:09:59.477]  He was there for that, and what he told me came out partially in the news.
[00:09:59.477 --> 00:10:20.805]  They were running a terror attack drill the day before and the day of that event, and just the sense of the troops he was giving me, that just all over the base, troops listened to the show, and I've confirmed that from other military sources, unknown to me and also known to us, that the radio show, the films, have been just
[00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:25.907]  on fire on military bases in the last five years.
[00:10:25.907 --> 00:10:29.208]  So we'll get a report from him.
[00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:39.632]  There's a lot he can't tell us, obviously, because of national security letters that he has signed, especially dealing with things he's witnessed in Iraq and other countries.
[00:10:39.632 --> 00:10:47.455]  But we'll talk about some very interesting things coming up in T-minus 50 minutes with the gentleman known as Joseph.
[00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:51.937]  And then Gerald Solente will be joining us after that.
[00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:54.439]  Barack Obama is coming to town.
[00:10:54.439 --> 00:11:00.042]  He's about to land just about three miles from where I sit out at Bergstrom International Airport.
[00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:04.224]  They've got the highway already shut down by the office here for his lordship.
[00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:07.626]  Uh, to be, uh, arriving here in town.
[00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:10.168]  Of course, his real name is Barry Sotero.
[00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:18.694]  And we've got a special little InfoWar, uh, treat, uh, for the, uh, president that we'll launch here on the radio show.
[00:11:18.694 --> 00:11:23.077]  I'll actually do that at the bottom of the hour, uh, coming up in 22 minutes.
[00:11:23.077 --> 00:11:29.102]  When we come back from break at the 33 after, I'll launch this, uh, here on the air dealing with Barry Sotero.
[00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:41.334]  Okay, let me just read to you a few of the stacks we have here.
[00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:46.675]  UN says Pakistan floods worse than 2004 tsunami.
[00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:54.037]  Massive deaths happening there affecting 13.8 million people who are in danger of being killed by the deluge.
[00:11:55.208 --> 00:12:00.552]  Also, they're reporting record hot temperatures in Moscow and serious wildfires there.
[00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:03.854]  And the media is saying, see, it's global warming.
[00:12:03.854 --> 00:12:12.940]  But meanwhile, Florida State University reports that the 2010 global tropical cyclone activity is again at a record low.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.403]  So both typhoons in the east and hurricanes in the west, they are
[00:12:18.735 --> 00:12:19.895]  Very, very weak this year.
[00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:41.261]  I think?
[00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:16.683]  That's why Lord Monckton and myself and many others always point out, just because you're having record cold in many areas of the world at any one time, that's completely normal, because you're always having record highs and record colds, depending on where you are on the planet.
[00:13:16.683 --> 00:13:25.070]  But it's global averages that show that in the last 15 years, the world has not been heating, and the last 10 started a cooling trend.
[00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:39.385]  But now because the sun has flared back up and increased the amount of different forms of radiation and heat it's putting off, most scientists agree you're going to now see the heating trend begin again.
[00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:45.372]  But the United Nations last year at Copenhagen put out a declaration saying the sun has no effect on our climate.
[00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:55.406]  That's like saying jumping off a thousand foot cliff with no parachute will have no effect on your legs when you hit the bottom and it kills you.
[00:13:55.406 --> 00:13:56.028]  I mean, it's just...
[00:13:57.062 --> 00:14:04.626]  Just amazingly ridiculous, but every summer they hype global warming saying, look how hot it is.
[00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:07.748]  My gosh, it's 106 in Dallas.
[00:14:07.748 --> 00:14:10.410]  Well, I remember it being 110.
[00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:20.016]  During two-a-days, two separate summers in a row, and they wouldn't cancel our two-a-days or shorten them, and at some nearby high schools, a couple people died
[00:14:20.856 --> 00:14:29.680]  This is back in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and so they did then start suspending the two-a-days, you know, the two football workouts a day.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:39.524]  I mean, I remember that specifically, and the UN has been caught manipulating weather charts, manipulating buoy temperature readout data.
[00:14:39.524 --> 00:14:41.265]  It's all on record that they've been
[00:14:42.403 --> 00:14:46.324]  Caught doing this over and over and over again.
[00:14:46.324 --> 00:14:52.006]  So I've covered that little miscellaneous piece of news.
[00:14:52.006 --> 00:14:55.247]  Let me now get into the economy.
[00:14:55.247 --> 00:15:02.049]  Then I'm gonna get more into what's happening with the illegal A-lands and the takeover of the United States into the North American Union.
[00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:04.830]  How that ties in with the Curt Nemo story today.
[00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:09.031]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave millions to La Raza.
[00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:14.971]  We've also seen a serious military escalation.
[00:15:14.971 --> 00:15:20.836]  Reuters is reporting North Korea has fired artillery near its sea border, very close to ships.
[00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:31.404]  And of course, yesterday, North Korea seized a South Korean fishing boat that was in a disputed territorial water area between North and South Korea.
[00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:39.490]  And also, in the military section of news, we're seeing more saber-rattling by the United States and Israel, threatening to attack Iran.
[00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.131]  And Iran is saber-rattling back.
[00:15:41.131 --> 00:15:44.253]  I don't think that's a very good idea, but they're doing it.
[00:15:44.253 --> 00:15:48.115]  Iran vows to support Lebanon against Israeli aggression.
[00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:52.178]  So they're definitely heating up on that front.
[00:15:52.178 --> 00:15:55.880]  And Fidel Castro is warning that he's worried about nuclear conflagration.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.521]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:15:58.442 --> 00:16:04.287]  But right now, let's get into the economic news stack today.
[00:16:04.287 --> 00:16:07.510]  This is from CNBC.
[00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.133]  We have all of this linked up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:11.133 --> 00:16:13.636]  That's why I love the websites.
[00:16:13.636 --> 00:16:14.296]  They started out
[00:16:15.984 --> 00:16:28.189]  Thirteen and a half years ago, Infowars.com did, so I could post links to reports and legislation and documents so that people would have a place while listening to the live radio show to go check out the claims I was making.
[00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:36.952]  And that's still the main reason we have Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, though it's grown from there.
[00:16:36.952 --> 00:16:39.934]  We are in the equivalent of a Great Depression.
[00:16:40.856 --> 00:16:51.610]  Strategist says the midsummer rally is over and stocks will begin to downward leg before bottoming in October as the world economy is in what looks like a Great Depression.
[00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:59.620]  Robin Griffiths, a technical strategist at Cas Nova Capital, told CNBC this morning.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.942]  And this is what a lot of the other analysts are saying, looking at the similar charts from the 1920s and early 1930s.
[00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:18.466]  They say that it mirrors those charts, and that's what Bob Chapman, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Gerald Salente, Webster Tarpley, and many other economists and experts we've had on have concurred with.
[00:17:18.466 --> 00:17:21.607]  Equities are for losers and bond markets for winners.
[00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:24.509]  Equities are simply for people who like losing money.
[00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:27.890]  He went on to say, double dip is inevitable and imminent.
[00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:37.514]  As Keynesian stimulus measures have never worked anywhere, we are in the equivalent of a Great Depression following three years of credit crisis, he added.
[00:17:37.514 --> 00:17:41.775]  But there will be some winners and relative over-performers in the stock market.
[00:17:41.775 --> 00:17:43.056]  Yeah, the Federal Reserve insiders.
[00:17:44.548 --> 00:17:46.188]  Firms like Caterpillar will do well.
[00:17:46.188 --> 00:17:49.569]  America has some great companies and CAD is one of them.
[00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.009]  I also like the German market.
[00:17:51.009 --> 00:17:57.791]  Yeah, they've blocked the pension fund rating and they've also blocked the brokerage firms coming in and rating the euro.
[00:17:57.791 --> 00:18:04.492]  Exports are doing well and will be further boosted by performance of the euro over the last 12 months.
[00:18:04.492 --> 00:18:08.313]  German exports rose by a higher than expected 3.8% in June.
[00:18:08.313 --> 00:18:11.554]  That's because their government protects their domestic production.
[00:18:13.865 --> 00:18:23.269]  Their manufacturing system in June following strong demand from across the world for German goods, according to data released Monday.
[00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.591]  I agree with that analysis.
[00:18:25.591 --> 00:18:27.571]  Here's another one from CNBC.
[00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:28.932]  Dollar will weaken.
[00:18:28.932 --> 00:18:32.034]  Three sectors will rule, strategists say.
[00:18:32.034 --> 00:18:34.555]  And they've got the job report.
[00:18:34.555 --> 00:18:36.896]  It's worse than what they even put out last week.
[00:18:39.558 --> 00:18:46.169]  They went on to say that they should look to technology and energy and industrial sectors.
[00:18:46.169 --> 00:18:47.431]  Continuing, Wall Street.
[00:18:49.611 --> 00:19:04.234]  Rewards to trigger surge in informants, and it reports how the stimulus bill can pay up to million-dollar cash rewards to people that rat out their bosses for financial impropriety.
[00:19:04.234 --> 00:19:06.355]  But this will all be selectively enforced.
[00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:17.137]  I mean, the Securities and Exchange Commission, as Fox News and AP reported in the last two weeks, as we reported in the last three months on the legislation with Ron Paul and others breaking it down here on air,
[00:19:19.275 --> 00:19:33.162]  The Securities and Exchange Commission, when insiders expose Madoff or Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan or AIG engaged in out-and-out criminal activity, for decades the SEC covers it up.
[00:19:34.639 --> 00:19:36.760]  And it goes on, new U.S.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:47.665]  whistleblowing incentives within the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act that could net informants multi-million dollar payouts are likely to generate a surge in allegations against U.S.
[00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:49.506]  listed companies and Wall Street banks.
[00:19:49.506 --> 00:19:58.290]  Yeah, the globalists are going to have Whistleblower give them intel and then selectively go after their competition to consolidate things further.
[00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.071]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.441 --> 00:20:02.983]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[00:20:02.983 --> 00:20:06.547]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[00:20:06.547 --> 00:20:15.034]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[00:20:15.034 --> 00:20:20.519]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:25.604]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:34.172]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[00:20:34.172 --> 00:20:39.638]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:40.859]  Our foods are their enemy.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:47.305]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[00:20:47.305 --> 00:20:50.287]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[00:20:50.287 --> 00:20:53.550]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.011]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence!
[00:21:02.213 --> 00:21:07.976]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:20.062]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:20.062 --> 00:21:28.326]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:28.326 --> 00:21:32.008]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:21:32.864 --> 00:21:49.060]  Now I'm offering 50 all organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.762]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:21:51.762 --> 00:21:57.228]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:22:00.126 --> 00:22:02.909]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:04.951]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[00:22:04.951 --> 00:22:05.852]  debt crises.
[00:22:05.852 --> 00:22:06.892]  You heard me right.
[00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:09.355]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[00:22:09.355 --> 00:22:13.018]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[00:22:13.018 --> 00:22:19.885]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:21.646]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:21.646 --> 00:22:28.828]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[00:22:28.828 --> 00:22:36.671]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[00:22:36.671 --> 00:22:40.372]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[00:22:40.612 --> 00:22:42.694]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:44.876]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[00:22:44.876 --> 00:22:46.937]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[00:22:46.937 --> 00:22:47.238]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.305 --> 00:23:03.307]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:23:03.307 --> 00:23:05.368]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:23:05.368 --> 00:23:08.130]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.351]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:23:10.351 --> 00:23:11.752]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:23:11.752 --> 00:23:13.674]  But first, the facts.
[00:23:13.674 --> 00:23:15.595]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:23:15.595 --> 00:23:17.576]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:23:17.576 --> 00:23:21.259]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:29.023]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:23:29.023 --> 00:23:29.624]  Sinofresh.
[00:23:29.884 --> 00:23:32.965]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[00:23:48.089 --> 00:23:49.249]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[00:23:49.249 --> 00:23:49.629]  Mention GCN.
[00:23:49.629 --> 00:23:50.570]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.750]  It works!
[00:24:09.395 --> 00:24:18.003]  Continuing with the financial news, Wall Street rewards the trigger surge in informants.
[00:24:18.003 --> 00:24:28.352]  But we know the SEC, as part of the financial overhaul, got language written in where they cannot be reviewed and they can operate secretly.
[00:24:28.352 --> 00:24:34.578]  A private Federal Reserve Board is being given full control over every facet of the economy to steal more.
[00:24:35.728 --> 00:24:46.733]  The very culprits of the massacre in the chicken coop, the weasels and the foxes, are now being hired to run guard duty on the chicken coop.
[00:24:46.733 --> 00:24:59.659]  But they're going to sick the general population on other financial institutions, insurance companies, businesses, where the government can then selectively cherry-pick who they want to go after.
[00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:02.160]  This is similar to the famous cases that are legion
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:20.309]  In drug cases where they have, in some cases, famous informants who testify in hundreds of drug trials and IRS trials, where they just walk in and lie, and the police and the prosecutors know they're lying, they don't care.
[00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:27.903]  And so this is part of the new financial terrorism against the general population.
[00:25:27.903 --> 00:25:38.791]  And the article goes on, the Securities and Exchange Commission is expecting a sharp increase in tip-offs from senior employees and third parties prompted by potential seven-figure bounties.
[00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:43.414]  The scale of the awards reflects the high quality of whistleblowers we hope for.
[00:25:43.414 --> 00:25:51.600]  People within a company, broker, or other related firm that we might not have heard from, Stephen Cohen said, including
[00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:58.684]  Different accounting firms and law firms that you hire for taxes and CPAs.
[00:25:58.684 --> 00:26:00.545]  Isn't that just special?
[00:26:00.545 --> 00:26:15.708]  Four years ago they changed the federal rules, not the law, but the rules, where CPAs are liable for the tax returns they file for you and so they won't even give you the supposed tax write-offs that are in law.
[00:26:16.696 --> 00:26:21.198]  And now they're just going to be completely on the payroll of the government.
[00:26:21.198 --> 00:26:25.780]  That reminds me of the 60-minute piece I saw more than a decade ago and since then it's gotten more attention.
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.302]  Remember the famous case of a guy flying from Virginia to Houston?
[00:26:29.302 --> 00:26:30.762]  He'd done it many times.
[00:26:30.762 --> 00:26:37.906]  He would pay cash because he got a discount for the trees that would be hauled from Texas via 18-wheeler to Virginia.
[00:26:39.113 --> 00:26:39.394]  and he
[00:26:58.615 --> 00:26:59.335]  We're good to go.
[00:27:12.619 --> 00:27:17.942]  That's just like the reports you see constantly, usually in Texas for some reason, of small-town cops.
[00:27:17.942 --> 00:27:24.505]  They pull over an old lady, she opens her purse up to give them a license, they see $5,000 in cash, and they say, that could be drug money.
[00:27:24.505 --> 00:27:25.866]  No judge, no jury.
[00:27:25.866 --> 00:27:26.726]  My money.
[00:27:26.726 --> 00:27:27.507]  Mine.
[00:27:27.507 --> 00:27:28.767]  Mine.
[00:27:28.767 --> 00:27:30.508]  This is the corrupt system.
[00:27:30.508 --> 00:27:35.311]  So, spent too much time on that, but it's an interesting area to discuss.
[00:27:35.311 --> 00:27:39.353]  Meanwhile, CNBC reports Tyson's profits surge.
[00:27:39.353 --> 00:27:40.914]  Beef and pork improve.
[00:27:42.506 --> 00:28:00.151]  And of course they have a oligopoly here in the United States and it's come out in major news reports including USA Today that they can have in some cases hundreds of times the violations in their plants than other companies but they're allowed to do it and nobody else is.
[00:28:00.871 --> 00:28:10.178]  Just like BP had many, many times in Houston alone, in Texas City, violations at their refineries, more than all other refineries combined.
[00:28:10.178 --> 00:28:11.059]  That's okay.
[00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:16.363]  They get safety awards from Bush and Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:28:16.363 --> 00:28:19.305]  That's AKA, of course, Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:28:19.305 --> 00:28:20.006]  Barry Suterib.
[00:28:21.348 --> 00:28:22.949]  So, uh, all part of the monopoly.
[00:28:22.949 --> 00:28:33.078]  The monopoly men, like Carlos Slim, controlling the cell phone market, he just makes billions every year in Mexico because he has a quasi-monopoly down there.
[00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:39.043]  That's where the big profits are made, as the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty said, competition is a sin.
[00:28:40.522 --> 00:28:45.524]  Continuing, the United States looking more and more like a third world country dealing with the economy.
[00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:47.885]  You don't have reliable energy.
[00:28:47.885 --> 00:28:52.006]  They want to put massive taxes on coal that supplies 51% of our electricity.
[00:28:52.006 --> 00:28:55.888]  And we build just two or three new power plants a year.
[00:28:55.888 --> 00:28:58.648]  China's building two or three a week.
[00:28:58.648 --> 00:29:02.390]  But under the new carbon taxes, new plants would not even be allowed.
[00:29:03.851 --> 00:29:04.211]  U.S.
[00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:06.495]  electricity blackouts skyrocketing.
[00:29:06.495 --> 00:29:18.833]  CNN reports New York's Staten Island was broiling under a life-threatening heat wave that brought President James Molinaro was seriously concerned about the area's Little League baseball players.
[00:29:19.474 --> 00:29:29.760]  And it just goes on to mention that they're having massive power outages that are intensifying in the last few years across the United States.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.102]  We'll come back with more financial news and military news.
[00:29:33.102 --> 00:29:43.988]  Then I want to get into the Rockefeller Foundation, along with Bill and Melinda Gates, funding the La Reconquista, La Invasora of Mecha and La Raza, fully funded by the U.S.
[00:29:43.988 --> 00:29:45.449]  government and the Pentagon.
[00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:48.767]  Yeah, we got a lot of enemies, folks, but we're gonna defeat them.
[00:29:48.767 --> 00:29:50.449]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.449 --> 00:29:51.851]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:54.394]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.394 --> 00:29:57.077]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.979 --> 00:30:05.241]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:05.241 --> 00:30:08.906]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:11.410]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:16.819]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:23.921]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:29.904]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:29.904 --> 00:30:33.605]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.085 --> 00:30:38.369]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:44.334]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:44.334 --> 00:30:47.876]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:47.876 --> 00:30:49.858]  The police state isn't coming.

[00:31:01.462 --> 00:31:05.423]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:05.423 --> 00:31:14.286]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:31:14.286 --> 00:31:18.907]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:31:18.907 --> 00:31:29.730]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:39.872]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:39.872 --> 00:31:45.294]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:31:45.294 --> 00:31:52.795]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:32:56.489 --> 00:32:58.230]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:33:03.117 --> 00:33:04.119]  Big Brother.
[00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:05.781]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:07.183]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:07.183 --> 00:33:08.445]  You want answers?
[00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:10.509]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:13.653]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.999 --> 00:33:34.223]  We've got our big announcement dealing with Barry Sitaro, aka Barack H. Obama, set to land at Austin International Bergstrom Airport in the next 20 minutes or so to make his way to a $5,000 a plate fundraiser at the Four Seasons Hotel.
[00:33:34.223 --> 00:33:38.905]  There's a protest going on at UT where he'll be speaking later at 2 p.m.
[00:33:38.905 --> 00:33:46.167]  The media is reporting that it's mainly Obamanoid supporters out there, so if you're not a supporter of the Indonesian citizen,
[00:33:47.418 --> 00:33:48.319]  The evidence is clear.
[00:33:48.319 --> 00:33:55.222]  Born in Kenya, and you don't like his big government takeover of healthcare, his looting with the banks of the economy.
[00:33:55.222 --> 00:34:03.007]  Get out there and let Slimebag know that you're fully aware of his treasonous, treacherous activities with the open borders, all of it.
[00:34:03.507 --> 00:34:12.554]  I got a key announcement coming up here in just a moment, but first I want to tell you about AcolaBlue.com, the super high-quality atmospheric water generator.
[00:34:12.554 --> 00:34:23.563]  Looks like a high-tech water cooler without the water bottle on top, and it grabs the water out of the air, and it's got hot water, cold water, puts it through 7 to 12 filters depending on which unit you get.
[00:34:23.563 --> 00:34:27.166]  AcolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[00:34:27.987 --> 00:34:28.587]  We're good to go.
[00:34:47.475 --> 00:34:50.518]  I'm sure you've heard about the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza.
[00:34:50.518 --> 00:34:53.360]  I know for many years I heard about how it's the best training out there.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.462]  There's no drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[00:34:55.462 --> 00:34:56.683]  It's out in Pahrump, Nevada.
[00:34:56.683 --> 00:35:02.569]  They have a lot of other key information as well and training tips for free on their website, FrontSight.com.
[00:35:02.569 --> 00:35:04.771]  Like the front of your rifle, FrontSight.com.
[00:35:05.251 --> 00:35:06.192]  Okay, here is the big announcement.
[00:35:28.399 --> 00:35:48.990]  We'll put it on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, but for InfoWars.com readers and for radio listeners, you'll want to make your way over to PrisonPlanet.com, where this was just posted five minutes ago, or InfoWars.com, where it's now being posted as we speak by Kurt Nemo, who by the way has now moved from New Mexico to Austin, Texas.
[00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.371]  He is now
[00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:54.535]  in the rebel command base as we defend liberty and resist tyranny.
[00:35:54.535 --> 00:35:55.655]  Good to have Kurt here with us.
[00:35:55.655 --> 00:35:58.718]  He'll be in studio a lot with us, maybe even filling in in the future.
[00:35:58.718 --> 00:36:00.279]  I really look forward to having him here.
[00:36:00.279 --> 00:36:01.780]  It's very exciting.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:08.586]  But Kurt Nimmo is also posting that right now in real time at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:08.586 --> 00:36:14.551]  Barry Sotaro, aka Barack Obama's political dynasty, crashes and burns.
[00:36:15.543 --> 00:36:17.464]  That's not the big announcement.
[00:36:17.464 --> 00:36:24.126]  We saw the media building him up in 2008 elections as God, as Christ.
[00:36:24.126 --> 00:36:27.987]  Many media outlets said it was like he's Jesus.
[00:36:27.987 --> 00:36:33.249]  He was Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King and George Washington rolled into one.
[00:36:33.249 --> 00:36:36.670]  He was going to give you free health care, free cars, free homes.
[00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.091]  Everything was going to be milk and honey.
[00:36:39.079 --> 00:36:40.360]  He was going to end the wars.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.802]  He was going to stop the torture.
[00:36:41.802 --> 00:36:43.744]  He was going to stop the secret arrest.
[00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:45.686]  He was going to free the internet.
[00:36:45.686 --> 00:36:52.574]  He has taken everything Bush was doing and basically it was like adding nitrous oxide to a race car.
[00:36:52.574 --> 00:36:55.597]  He's only turbo supercharged it.
[00:36:55.597 --> 00:37:00.042]  And so if we were going 200 miles an hour towards the New World Order over a cliff, we're going 300 miles an hour.
[00:37:01.423 --> 00:37:11.205]  Total integration, the baton was handed off flawlessly from George W. the Puppet to Barack H. Obama, true name Barry Sotero.
[00:37:11.205 --> 00:37:16.227]  Now, here's the big announcement.
[00:37:16.227 --> 00:37:21.328]  We've done this eight times, and every time it's been the number one search in the last three weeks.
[00:37:21.328 --> 00:37:26.569]  We do it a few times a week, and I got a lot of emails saying, why don't you make the key search term Barry Sotero?
[00:37:28.254 --> 00:37:32.515]  That was listener recommended by a lot of people on and off air.
[00:37:32.515 --> 00:37:34.276]  And great minds think alike.
[00:37:34.276 --> 00:37:46.360]  I think that's a wonderful idea, but you can't just make it the key search term without having an article that becomes the number one link that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people will then link to.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:55.803]  And in some cases, hundreds of newspapers and blogs report on the top search terms that we've promoted, but always it's at least 30, 40, 50 or so and causes a big buzz.
[00:37:56.903 --> 00:38:02.485]  This won't save the world what we're about to do, but the act of resistance will go a long way towards it.
[00:38:02.485 --> 00:38:17.509]  It's one more step on this thousand-mile journey and we're more than halfway there defeating the globalists if we just continue with perseverance to march towards Mount Doom and throw the Ring of Doom into the fires from which it was made.
[00:38:17.509 --> 00:38:24.571]  And by politically destroying and unmasking and revealing the fraud that is Obama, people were awake to Bush,
[00:38:26.912 --> 00:38:36.158]  Now they've awoken to Obama, and instead of just, now the Republicans are in favor, the Democrats are out of favor, they always tag team us back and forth.
[00:38:36.158 --> 00:38:45.204]  Now, because of the fact that people are getting wise to the false left-right paradigm, you have both political parties with record low approval ratings.
[00:38:45.204 --> 00:38:53.790]  You don't just have incumbent Democrats in all the major primaries losing, you have incumbent Republicans, or candidates that are seen as establishment losing.
[00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:56.652]  That's why the Democrats are now running TV ads nationwide, a whole
[00:38:57.853 --> 00:38:58.753]  We're good to go.
[00:39:20.942 --> 00:39:28.852]  And so they're actually starting to figure that out, but people are becoming very sophisticated and understanding what's happening.
[00:39:30.037 --> 00:39:58.016]  And so, to commemorate Barry Sotero, aka Barack H. Obama, coming to Austin, Texas and shutting down the highways and his wife on her multi-million, it's not a half million, it's multi-million if you count all the Secret Service and Air Force Two and the rest of it, and shutting down the beaches and the rest of it, it's in the millions, to commemorate Marie Antoinette and their corruption, to commemorate the fact that we see through his puppetry and that we've already politically destroyed him,
[00:39:59.272 --> 00:40:10.319]  Now we've got to educate people to the next level of understanding that establishment Republicans like Mitt Romney and General Petraeus are not the answer as well.
[00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:11.860]  The answer is Ron Paul 2012.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.062]  The answer is nullification at the state level.
[00:40:15.062 --> 00:40:23.247]  If we spent the same amount of energy we spend on presidential elections that are rigged to a certain extent by the billions that are given to the candidates by the megacorporations,
[00:40:23.747 --> 00:40:33.069]  If we spent the time and energy on the states, which we're starting to do, we can take them back under the remedy the founders gave us, the 9th and 10th Amendment, and neutralize these people big time.
[00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:39.771]  And they realize that, that's why they're trying to block the states' rights movement.
[00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:44.652]  But I want to put back on screen for people the article, Barry Sotero, aka
[00:40:47.401 --> 00:40:51.263]  Barack Obama's political dynasty crashes and burns.
[00:40:51.263 --> 00:41:00.828]  I need you to get this article from PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, and I need you to post it on your blog, your Facebook, your MySpace.
[00:41:00.828 --> 00:41:03.249]  I need you to make YouTube videos about it.
[00:41:03.249 --> 00:41:13.895]  I need you to type the name Barry Sotero, B-A-R-R-Y S-O-E-T-O-R-O, into search engines.
[00:41:14.955 --> 00:41:15.855]  But not just Google.
[00:41:15.855 --> 00:41:17.095]  Let's do Yahoo.
[00:41:17.095 --> 00:41:18.216]  Let's do some of the others.
[00:41:18.216 --> 00:41:21.656]  Let's make it number one, the biggest push we've ever done.
[00:41:21.656 --> 00:41:26.977]  And you know, I want to do this sparingly, but time is short.
[00:41:26.977 --> 00:41:42.700]  Even ABC is announcing that there's a deal between Google and Verizon that begins to end net neutrality and freedom on the web as we know it, meaning they're going to start restricting what sites you can visit or making companies pay more to have their sites be accessible or to load quickly.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:50.124]  The federal government, as you know, the FCC and others, the Federal Trade Commission as well, are moving to start censoring the web.
[00:41:50.124 --> 00:41:56.247]  They're openly pushing how this is important to do with their Cybersecurity Act and Internet 2 and all of it.
[00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:58.989]  So we need to use the web while we've got it.
[00:41:59.349 --> 00:42:05.454]  And so I'm taking your recommendations as listeners to make Barry Sotero the number one search term.
[00:42:05.454 --> 00:42:10.798]  But it's up to you now and I commend you, I salute you, I thank you for the great jobs you've done.
[00:42:10.798 --> 00:42:12.920]  This is your mission if you choose to accept it.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.802]  Barry Sotero.
[00:42:14.802 --> 00:42:15.622]  You spell Sotero.
[00:42:15.622 --> 00:42:16.443]  S-O-E-T-O-R-O.
[00:42:16.443 --> 00:42:16.803]  S-O-E-T-O-R-O.
[00:42:22.788 --> 00:42:30.966]  Barry Sotaro, that's his Indonesian name, when he gave up his U.S.
[00:42:30.966 --> 00:42:31.627]  citizenship.
[00:42:31.627 --> 00:42:32.249]  This is admitted.
[00:42:34.233 --> 00:42:40.638]  You can debate the Kenyan situation, though it looks extremely suspicious, but we know he had to give up his U.S.
[00:42:40.638 --> 00:42:46.141]  citizenship to become an Indonesian citizen and take on his name.
[00:42:46.141 --> 00:42:49.424]  This is in his college records, the records we do have.
[00:42:49.424 --> 00:42:51.425]  The media has reported it like it's no big deal.
[00:42:51.425 --> 00:42:55.248]  We've got links to mainstream news admitting his real name is Barry Sotero.
[00:42:55.788 --> 00:43:04.050]  And if we can expose that this guy's a fraud and not eligible to be president, everything he's done is made null and void.
[00:43:05.424 --> 00:43:26.714]  So Barry Sotaro, Barry Sotaro, S-O-E-T-O-R-O, Barry Sotaro is the search term for August 9th, Monday, August 9th, 2010, and the number one link on news and web will be our article if you click on it and send it out to everyone you know.
[00:43:27.094 --> 00:43:28.515]  So we need this to be the top link.
[00:43:28.515 --> 00:43:31.877]  That means send the link out to everybody, because whatever gets the most traffic goes to the top.
[00:43:31.877 --> 00:43:35.499]  And we need you to make up the number one search term, Barry Sotero.
[00:43:35.499 --> 00:43:43.924]  This will be another devastating salvo of truth against the globalist lies, because people are really starting to find out.
[00:43:43.924 --> 00:43:46.886]  There was a CBS News poll last week.
[00:43:46.886 --> 00:43:47.867]  There was another big poll.
[00:43:47.867 --> 00:43:48.908]  In fact, I forget the other poll.
[00:43:48.908 --> 00:43:53.931]  You guys search six out of ten Americans question a president's birth.
[00:43:54.631 --> 00:44:00.253]  Or origin of his birth, because I want that other... I saw the CBS, but I don't remember the other one.
[00:44:00.253 --> 00:44:04.655]  One showed an even 6 out of 10 in several thousand questioned.
[00:44:04.655 --> 00:44:06.036]  The other poll, it was more.
[00:44:06.036 --> 00:44:08.196]  It was almost 7 out of 10.
[00:44:08.196 --> 00:44:11.218]  It was a fraction below that, and I don't remember the exact number.
[00:44:11.218 --> 00:44:12.898]  I just know it was above 6 out of 10.
[00:44:12.898 --> 00:44:16.160]  6 out of 10 know he's an illegitimate fraud.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.341]  He was an Indonesian citizen.
[00:44:20.495 --> 00:44:22.016]  His name is Barry Sotaro.
[00:44:22.016 --> 00:44:22.916]  Sotaro.
[00:44:22.916 --> 00:44:24.337]  So, Barry Sotaro.
[00:44:24.337 --> 00:44:25.217]  Barry Sotaro.
[00:44:25.217 --> 00:44:26.157]  Two words.
[00:44:26.157 --> 00:44:27.418]  That's the search term today.
[00:44:27.418 --> 00:44:29.078]  Barry Sotaro.
[00:44:29.078 --> 00:44:32.100]  And the establishment cannot stand this, I'll tell you.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.420]  And this will be a very effective term.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.121]  Conservatively, hundreds of thousands.
[00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:38.082]  Probably millions of people.
[00:44:39.568 --> 00:44:39.948]  We're good
[00:44:59.107 --> 00:45:04.308]  Whose true name is Barry Sotero as the President of the United States.
[00:45:04.308 --> 00:45:16.210]  In fact, Cole Watson, have him post those last videos that are on the Alex Jones Channel that were grabbed from PresidentPlanet.TV with Phil Berg, what, a week ago or so when he was on.
[00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:19.951]  Let's add those videos into the article as well.
[00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:22.671]  CNN says bad news for Obama.
[00:45:22.671 --> 00:45:24.692]  6 out of 10 doubt U.S.
[00:45:24.692 --> 00:45:25.312]  birth story.
[00:45:26.272 --> 00:45:32.174]  Poll numbers for those questioning eligibility status continue to rise.
[00:45:32.174 --> 00:45:39.476]  The poll was taken July 16th to 21st out of 1,018 adults, including 335 Democrats, 285 Republicans.
[00:45:39.476 --> 00:45:41.017]  It has a margin of error of 3%.
[00:45:41.017 --> 00:45:43.098]  So they over-polled Democrats trying to skew it.
[00:45:43.098 --> 00:45:44.118]  Still didn't work.
[00:45:44.118 --> 00:45:52.301]  The question was, do you think Barack Obama was definitively born in the United States, probably born in the United States, probably born in another country, or definitely born in another country?
[00:45:53.274 --> 00:45:57.196]  Definitely in the United States, got 42%.
[00:45:57.196 --> 00:46:02.540]  But of the other 60 plus percent, they questioned where he was really born.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.861]  But I think that's reporting on the CBS poll.
[00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:05.902]  There's another one too.
[00:46:05.902 --> 00:46:07.843]  But regardless, there it is for you.
[00:46:07.843 --> 00:46:11.325]  Good job, guys, finding that article.
[00:46:12.606 --> 00:46:19.129]  They can sit there and tell us we're kooks and nobody's listening to you and you can't beat us and we can put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[00:46:19.129 --> 00:46:20.610]  No, you can't.
[00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:23.931]  So, Barry Sotero, go back to Indonesia.
[00:46:23.931 --> 00:46:25.352]  You gave up your citizenship.
[00:46:25.352 --> 00:46:27.313]  You're landing in my town, Austin, Texas.
[00:46:27.853 --> 00:46:31.696]  Here's my little gift to you from myself and my audience.
[00:46:31.696 --> 00:46:33.557]  Number one Google search term.
[00:46:33.557 --> 00:46:47.768]  I got a sneaking suspicion, unless Google's got a block on this term, that it's going to be numero uno and we're going to be nine for nine victorious with our article, Barry Sotero, aka Barack Obama's political dynasty crashes and burns.
[00:46:48.922 --> 00:46:56.027]  Not only will they find out his real name is Barry Sotero and he's from Indonesia and gave up his citizenship, they'll find out about his globalist aims.
[00:46:56.027 --> 00:46:58.729]  This is a great article Paul Watson threw together.
[00:46:58.729 --> 00:47:00.711]  I called him at about 10.30 with this idea.
[00:47:01.929 --> 00:47:09.533]  So about an hour ago and I said please get us a report by halfway into the first hour and he got it up in time and it's an excellent article.
[00:47:09.533 --> 00:47:14.075]  Barry Sotero aka Barack Obama's political dynasty crashes and burns.
[00:47:14.075 --> 00:47:20.878]  Will Obama be forced to rely on the engineered pre-election surprise to rescue his presidency?
[00:47:20.878 --> 00:47:23.880]  One surprise is he's saying he may forgive part of people's mortgages.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.823]  Which they claimed the first banker bailout was for.
[00:47:27.823 --> 00:47:28.604]  So watch that.
[00:47:28.604 --> 00:47:29.585]  That'll be a bait and switch.
[00:47:29.585 --> 00:47:33.829]  They'll probably pass that, but then after the election withhold almost all of it.
[00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:36.031]  I mean, that's been their modus operandi.
[00:47:36.031 --> 00:47:38.373]  That's been their attack pattern.
[00:47:38.373 --> 00:47:42.937]  While Barry Sotero lavishes himself at a luxury Spanish resort,
[00:47:43.698 --> 00:47:49.242]  I'm actually going to go to PrisonPlanet.com and pull this up and read it from the telescreen itself.
[00:48:08.277 --> 00:48:12.361]  Against the third story down in the featured news section.
[00:48:12.361 --> 00:48:14.143]  Keyword search today.
[00:48:14.143 --> 00:48:15.844]  Barry Sotero.
[00:48:15.844 --> 00:48:17.426]  S-O-E-T-O-R-O.
[00:48:17.426 --> 00:48:24.913]  And you gotta love good old Barack Obama.
[00:48:26.641 --> 00:48:40.888]  Obama has come under widespread criticism for preaching austerity and financial discipline while shunning himself at the opulent resort in Costa del Sol region as his wife Michelle parades around in expensive designer clothing.
[00:48:40.888 --> 00:48:49.673]  As the country worsens and top financial experts openly talk of Americans entering a second Great Depression, Obama's approval ratings continue to head south in a hurry.
[00:48:49.673 --> 00:48:55.216]  As we expose in the Obama deception the manufactured populist euphoria behind the
[00:48:56.388 --> 00:48:57.249]  We're good to go.
[00:49:14.432 --> 00:49:19.555]  A Gallup poll shows the lowest figure since Sotero took office in 2009.
[00:49:19.555 --> 00:49:25.318]  For someone whose political career is obviously sinking out of sight, Obama seems remarkably relaxed about it.
[00:49:25.318 --> 00:49:37.704]  An ominous portent that the people who pull the strings have lined up a helpful pre-election surprise as a means of rallying the American people back around their fallen commander-in-chief.
[00:49:40.436 --> 00:49:52.144]  On one side of the scale, some are speculating Obama could announce a gigantic bailout of Main Street in the form of debt relief for millions of Americans whose homes are now worth more than their mortgages.
[00:49:52.144 --> 00:50:06.935]  This promised giveaway would likely invigorate support for Obama from millions of gullible idiots who voted for him in the first place while proclaiming that all their problems would be solved by the Christ-like Obama who would pay their mortgage and their gas bills.
[00:50:06.935 --> 00:50:07.916]  We have links to the videos
[00:50:08.556 --> 00:50:11.860]  Of those gullible zombies, Obama zombies, saying that.
[00:50:23.391 --> 00:50:33.395]  Of course, the rhetoric behind any such giveaway would be fantastic enough to buy votes in the short term, but the reality behind such a program would soon disintegrate into the aftermath of the midterms.
[00:50:33.395 --> 00:50:43.739]  However, on the extreme end of the scale, some are warning of, or even advocating, that Obama will launch an attack on Iran and resetting off World War III as a ploy through which to keep himself in power.
[00:50:44.179 --> 00:50:58.551]  Just as the 9-11 attack saw Bush's approval ratings soar into the 90s, rallying Americans around an external threat could be just the ticket for an administration that has completely polarized the country and whose actions have led to the creation of a fierce political opposition groups like the Tea Party.
[00:51:01.038 --> 00:51:05.662]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.478 --> 00:52:05.441]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.441 --> 00:52:06.442]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.442 --> 00:52:08.883]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:08.883 --> 00:52:09.904]  A republic.
[00:52:09.904 --> 00:52:12.546]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.546 --> 00:52:14.807]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.807 --> 00:52:16.828]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.828 --> 00:52:18.509]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.509 --> 00:52:19.830]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:20.430]  Children?
[00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:21.571]  Our education?
[00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.392]  Our money?
[00:52:22.392 --> 00:52:26.054]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.414 --> 00:52:30.118]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.118 --> 00:52:31.379]  You're being warned.
[00:52:31.379 --> 00:52:32.400]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.561]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:34.462]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.462 --> 00:52:35.363]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.363 --> 00:52:37.885]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:37.885 --> 00:52:41.669]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.769 --> 00:52:46.712]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.712 --> 00:52:48.213]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.213 --> 00:52:49.293]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:49.293 --> 00:52:55.737]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:00.626 --> 00:53:01.927]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.927 --> 00:53:07.511]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:12.534]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:12.534 --> 00:53:17.578]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:18.098 --> 00:53:23.322]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:23.322 --> 00:53:25.643]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:53:25.643 --> 00:53:30.446]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:30.446 --> 00:53:31.567]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:31.567 --> 00:53:34.629]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:53:34.629 --> 00:53:38.252]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:38.252 --> 00:53:41.454]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:53:41.454 --> 00:53:43.675]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:53:43.675 --> 00:53:44.596]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:48.238 --> 00:53:49.659]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:57.304]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:57.304 --> 00:53:59.686]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:12.398 --> 00:54:22.602]  We haven't had people like Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times of London say that Obama needs an Oklahoma City or 9-11 event so he can look strong for people.
[00:54:22.602 --> 00:54:29.124]  So when folks read this article with Barry Sotero being the top search term today, they will learn about all of this.
[00:54:30.257 --> 00:54:31.137]  It continues.
[00:54:31.137 --> 00:54:42.261]  However, on the extreme end of the scale, some are warning or even advocating that Obama will launch an attack on Iran and risk setting off World War III as a ploy through which to keep himself in power.
[00:54:42.261 --> 00:54:57.827]  Just as the 9-11 attack saw Bush's approval ratings soar into the 90s, rallying Americans around an external threat could be just the ticket for an administration that has completely polarized the country and whose actions have led to the creation of fierce political opposition groups like the Tea Party.
[00:54:58.487 --> 00:55:01.651]  Yeah, but maybe 20-30% max support him.
[00:55:01.651 --> 00:55:06.417]  It's not even polarization as unifying the country against the corrupt government.
[00:55:06.417 --> 00:55:12.745]  Obama and this whole theater that we've seen, this fiasco, has helped take the blinders off our eyes.
[00:55:13.953 --> 00:55:22.200]  There can be little doubt that unless an artificially engineered surprise event helps Obama turn things around, the losses for the Democrats will be drastic.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:32.349]  As Bruce Drake points out today, the party that controls the White House usually loses House seats in the off-year contest, and the losses are bigger when the President's job approval rating is below 50%.
[00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:43.460]  In 1994, when President Bill Clinton's approval rating stood at 46%, Republicans picked up 53 seats to recapture the House after it had been in the Democratic hands for most of the previous 40 years.
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:53.030]  The next three months will provide a clear answer as to whether Barry Sotaro's teleprompter reading days are over, or if there is to be a dramatic sting
[00:55:54.271 --> 00:56:09.206]  In the tale that will preserve Obama's political capital for just long enough to give him a shot at staying in the White House for another term and completing his conversion of the United States into the world government.
[00:56:09.206 --> 00:56:17.555]  And so the article is Barry Sotero aka Barack Obama's political dynasty crashes and burns a great boil down we hope
[00:56:18.868 --> 00:56:30.097]  Thanks for your help to make the number one search term Barry Sotero today so that hundreds of thousands, bare minimum, probably millions will read this article and find out the truth.
[00:56:30.097 --> 00:56:38.943]  And I'm going to have Watson also add our interviews with Phil Berg, the attorney, the father of the birther movement, in this article as well for folks that don't like to read.
[00:56:38.943 --> 00:56:47.069]  We'll post those videos in the middle of the article for some of the internet audience out there that just wants to see it via the spoken word show.
[00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:57.217]  Very exciting to be able to fight back and strike back against the propaganda of Barry Sotero, aka Barack Obama.
[00:56:57.217 --> 00:57:07.265]  I can hear on top of the studio on the roof, Rob Doo just climbed up there to get a video shot of the motorcade as it rolls by here in the next few minutes.
[00:57:07.265 --> 00:57:11.588]  Always good to have that B-roll footage in our films of his lordship.
[00:57:12.213 --> 00:57:22.642]  We already had a motorcade of Obama, Barry Sotero, back in 2008 when he secretly snuck in with Hillary with the Secret Service to Bilderberg.
[00:57:22.642 --> 00:57:25.905]  The rest of the media said, we don't know where they are, it's a secret meeting in Virginia.
[00:57:25.905 --> 00:57:33.751]  We knew where he'd be, as the heir apparent to George W. Bush, and Secret Service drove by with the little submachine guns and pointed it at us.
[00:57:33.751 --> 00:57:39.456]  How dare the American people go and expose a treasonous, treacherous meeting?
[00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:40.197]  How dare
[00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:44.800]  The American people try to actually show a secret meeting.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.383]  How dare us?
[00:57:47.383 --> 00:57:50.505]  How dare us stand up and resist?
[00:57:50.505 --> 00:57:56.430]  Before I end this hour, I want to remind folks we've got a special running for a little under two weeks.
[00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:59.633]  We had one where you get four copies of the Obama Deception for the price of one.
[00:58:00.473 --> 00:58:08.395]  Now we're doing it with part two of the Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, and I think it's an even more powerful film, though not as successful, very successful, not as successful as the Obama Deception.
[00:58:08.395 --> 00:58:10.796]  Buy one copy, get three copies free.
[00:58:10.796 --> 00:58:13.436]  Buy two copies, get eight copies free.

[00:58:37.805 --> 00:58:41.846]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.846 --> 00:58:45.367]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.858 --> 00:58:54.401]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:55.321]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.321 --> 00:58:58.744]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:58.744 --> 00:58:59.604]  Number 2.
[00:58:59.604 --> 00:59:04.507]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:05.248]  It's true.
[00:59:05.248 --> 00:59:10.111]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:10.951]  Number 3.
[00:59:10.951 --> 00:59:14.534]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.534 --> 00:59:18.216]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.436 --> 00:59:19.216]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.216 --> 00:59:21.977]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:21.977 --> 00:59:25.659]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.659 --> 00:59:26.459]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.459 --> 00:59:30.601]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.601 --> 00:59:35.663]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:26.842]  We've covered the financial news.
[01:00:26.842 --> 01:00:29.403]  We've also covered what's happening with the environment.
[01:00:29.403 --> 01:00:40.807]  I want to get into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funding La Raza, which is basically a Hispanic Ku Klux Klan organization that the media allows to be very racist.
[01:00:40.807 --> 01:00:42.328]  We're here speaking out against that.
[01:00:42.328 --> 01:00:45.129]  Why are the big banks and big money powers funding it?
[01:00:45.129 --> 01:00:50.311]  Well, they want to be able to have a political power to play off against the American people, regardless of what color you are.
[01:00:50.311 --> 01:00:51.111]  They're race baiting.
[01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:59.532]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded Obama when he was a state senator and funded all the racial division in Chicago.
[01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:05.773]  This is how they control us, divide and conquer, but they do it from a leftist perspective when they're race baiting.
[01:01:05.773 --> 01:01:07.774]  So I want everybody to come together against the New World Order.
[01:01:07.774 --> 01:01:08.894]  We're going to be talking about that.
[01:01:08.894 --> 01:01:13.055]  We'll be getting more into the economy with Gerald Solente coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:01:13.055 --> 01:01:16.316]  We've got a lot of Tea Party news as well.
[01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:20.757]  And issues with Iran and North Korea, big developments on that front.
[01:01:20.757 --> 01:01:30.799]  Again, coming up in 30 minutes, joining us via video connection for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, not just radio audiences, Gerald Cilente with his once-a-month visit with us, always informative.
[01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:37.880]  But I want to go now, for the balance of this half hour, to a gentleman we'll call Joseph.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.801]  Now, he wanted to use his real name, but I said, no, let's not do that.
[01:01:43.368 --> 01:01:46.710]  I actually know this gentleman through some people I work with in business.
[01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:48.973]  I know he's in the Army.
[01:01:48.973 --> 01:01:50.454]  I know he works in intelligence.
[01:01:50.454 --> 01:01:52.336]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:01:52.336 --> 01:01:55.899]  He was formerly a police officer before he joined the military.
[01:01:55.899 --> 01:02:03.506]  He can tell you some stories about Katrina, about the Fort Hood shooting, about police he works with in Austin.
[01:02:03.506 --> 01:02:04.246]  We're not going to say how.
[01:02:07.304 --> 01:02:18.528]  What they saw and what these firefighters he knows saw and actually part of this came out in the mainstream news dealing with the Joe Stack kamikaze attack on the IRS building in Austin a few months ago.
[01:02:18.528 --> 01:02:24.249]  But we first got contacted by him dealing with the sports stadium at Fort Hood.
[01:02:24.249 --> 01:02:29.131]  They're tearing it down but around it and the park putting up a barbed wire fence with barbed wire facing in.
[01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:35.293]  And I sent Rob Dew and Aaron Dykes out there this weekend or actually Friday to observe this and it was true.
[01:02:36.033 --> 01:02:57.652]  So I thought I would just get him on to talk about a few of these issues and also the exciting news he's given us that many other people I know in the military are also concurring with that there is a huge awakening in the military especially with non-commissioned officers and officers and let's just say the more intelligent arm of the military.
[01:02:57.652 --> 01:03:01.736]  I'm not saying the grunts aren't patriots and waking up too but the smart guys
[01:03:03.223 --> 01:03:04.444]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:03:04.444 --> 01:03:06.186]  It's great to be up with you and your audience.
[01:03:27.338 --> 01:03:32.985]  Well, Alex, in today's world, I don't see a whole lot of accountability and bravery.
[01:03:32.985 --> 01:03:43.016]  And we in the public service aspect of the government, we have to start standing up to what is right, to what is wrong, and doing what is right.
[01:03:43.016 --> 01:03:44.758]  And I see more and more of that every day.
[01:03:44.758 --> 01:03:47.001]  You know, my time as a police officer, I saw
[01:03:47.617 --> 01:03:50.818]  Corruption has just, it almost destroyed my soul, Alex.
[01:03:50.818 --> 01:03:52.779]  It shook me to my very core.
[01:03:52.779 --> 01:03:59.102]  And that's the reason I left and I went into the military, seeking larger accountability, thinking things would be better.
[01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:01.062]  And they have been, for the most part.
[01:04:01.062 --> 01:04:07.185]  And the people I've met here in Austin, the police that I know, the firefighters that I know, they're all great people.
[01:04:07.185 --> 01:04:09.786]  I haven't met the same kind of people that I knew on the Gulf Coast.
[01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:17.118]  And, uh, you know, obviously anything I'm going to say here about the military today is not going to be the direct opinion of the Department of Defense.
[01:04:17.118 --> 01:04:19.100]  I just wanted to say that right now.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:26.223]  So, uh, you know, as long as we're clear, the Department of Defense can't really hold anything against me.
[01:04:26.223 --> 01:04:29.285]  And we're not going to get anything classified.
[01:04:29.285 --> 01:04:33.007]  In fact, almost everything
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:40.843]  I think I need to take this as Jesse Ventura, but it's always like Charlie Sheen calling me when I'm out.
[01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.504]  I forgot to turn my ringer off.
[01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.045]  Stay there.
[01:04:44.045 --> 01:04:44.485]  Stay there.
[01:04:44.485 --> 01:04:48.748]  We're going to come right back to you on the other side of this break, Joseph.
[01:04:48.748 --> 01:04:51.970]  We're going to break down some of the things you've witnessed in the next two segments.

[01:05:10.799 --> 01:05:18.182]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:05:18.182 --> 01:05:23.065]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:08:08.138 --> 01:08:12.581]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:08:12.581 --> 01:08:17.865]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.865 --> 01:08:24.769]  Well, for the last 30 minutes, they've had the highway shut down right outside our office for Barack Obama to drive by any minute.
[01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:26.931]  There's Secret Service all over the place.
[01:08:26.931 --> 01:08:29.573]  We're out there with a video camera to get the motorcade coming by.
[01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:31.814]  I wonder if they'll come over and harass us.
[01:08:31.814 --> 01:08:36.798]  In America, trying to videotape Barry Sitaro, the imposter president.
[01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:39.340]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:42.923]  In fact, guys, have another camera ready just to catch it if they come over here.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.402]  A lot of other crazy stuff going on.
[01:08:47.402 --> 01:08:55.368]  I just had Ventura's people call me during the break, but we'll see if I'm able to talk about some of this later in the week, some of the things developing on that front.
[01:08:55.368 --> 01:09:04.415]  But we're joined in this segment, the next, and then Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster, is going to be on with us for a full hour and a half coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:04.415 --> 01:09:10.100]  We're talking to Joseph, who was a police officer and got disillusioned by what he saw in Katrina.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.201]  Then he joined the military.
[01:09:11.961 --> 01:09:13.882]  And I know who he is.
[01:09:13.882 --> 01:09:18.443]  I mean, we work with and are friends with some folks that are very close friends with him.
[01:09:18.443 --> 01:09:22.584]  And we have a lot of other military sources, but this is a source that we can directly confirm.
[01:09:22.584 --> 01:09:27.685]  He gave us some information about fences being put in that face in on the base at Fort Hood.
[01:09:27.685 --> 01:09:30.406]  We went out there in the public area of the base, and there it is.
[01:09:30.406 --> 01:09:31.246]  We're watching that.
[01:09:31.886 --> 01:09:35.087]  So much to talk about with him and the time we've got.
[01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:47.092]  Let's start with what you saw on the Gulf Coast during Katrina and then what you've seen when you're in the military dealing with the shooting at Fort Hood, dealing with the intel you got from the fire department and others about Joe Stack.
[01:09:48.444 --> 01:09:55.071]  Okay, Alex, I'll start with the Austin story, since it's nearest and dearest to a lot of people there, where you're located.
[01:09:55.071 --> 01:10:10.147]  I'm personal friends with a lot of people down in the Austin Fire Department, and when we were at an unofficial function, we were talking, my wife and his wife and gentlemen, and he had mentioned that all the police chiefs, or the fire chiefs,
[01:10:10.788 --> 01:10:18.833]  We're in a meeting at the time of the attack, and I don't know whether he said steam or not, but obviously you can speculate on your own.
[01:10:18.833 --> 01:10:25.958]  But anyway, they were informed by their wives through text messages that Joe Stack had attacked.
[01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:29.180]  And they asked what was going on, and they said, don't worry about it.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.261]  Let's keep this meeting together.
[01:10:30.261 --> 01:10:32.242]  We have more important things right now.
[01:10:32.242 --> 01:10:38.326]  Well, eventually, one of the police or fire chiefs got brave enough to stand up and leave the room, and the rest followed after that.
[01:10:40.675 --> 01:10:42.356]  And they were running a drill that day.
[01:10:42.356 --> 01:11:01.170]  We first got that within minutes of it happening, that fire trucks were already there at the scene as part of a drill on 183 in North Austin, but that the police chiefs and the fire chiefs were all in this emergency center drill and were being told, don't leave, don't deal with that, the feds will handle it.
[01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:07.895]  And eyewitnesses that we've had on the show, at apartments and who were in the building across the street as part of the Echelon Complex,
[01:11:08.915 --> 01:11:21.258]  Uh, across the parking lot said that within seconds, by the time they looked out the window, there was FBI out there taking video cameras, you know, telling people to stand down, uh, that it looked very, very suspicious.
[01:11:21.258 --> 01:11:26.139]  And then other witnesses said on record they saw the plane fly by, clearly nobody in the cockpit.
[01:11:26.139 --> 01:11:28.740]  Then there were bizarre cover-ups with the body.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:30.260]  Uh, the whole thing was very suspicious.
[01:11:31.468 --> 01:11:34.489]  Right, and that's what I got from them.
[01:11:34.489 --> 01:11:41.092]  And of course, they're not really into a lot of the stuff politically that's going on around them, but it even spooked their interest.
[01:11:41.092 --> 01:11:44.293]  So, there's a lot to be said about that, Alex.
[01:11:44.293 --> 01:11:54.458]  Now, you said separately that the police officers and the firefighters that you work with, that a lot of them are really awake now.
[01:11:55.674 --> 01:12:17.342]  Well, um, yeah, especially the troops that I'm with, Alex, I've passed out, uh, you know, the pocket constitution that you get with every one of your videos or everything that you order from Imple Wars, the Citizen's Rulebook, uh, you just, every time you order something from Imple Wars, or you can order a large packet, if you're in the military or police department, and what I did was I passed these out to the guys in my squad.
[01:12:17.342 --> 01:12:23.864]  I said, guys, you know, we swore an oath to God to protect the Constitution and the people of the United States.
[01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:29.869]  Now let's talk about, let's go back to what you witnessed as a police officer during Katrina, then let's fast forward to the Fort Hood shooter.
[01:12:53.004 --> 01:12:56.007]  Okay, well, uh, I was a police officer down on the Gulf Coast.
[01:12:56.007 --> 01:12:57.769]  I'm gonna leave the city out of it.
[01:12:57.769 --> 01:13:02.173]  Um, but I was a police officer down there in the year of 2006.
[01:13:02.173 --> 01:13:04.315]  Graduated the Police Academy with honors.
[01:13:04.315 --> 01:13:09.540]  Uh, started, and within the first week, I was training down there with a, uh, sergeant.
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:14.125]  And, uh, we did a traffic stop on somebody who was in a vehicle in their driveway.
[01:13:14.125 --> 01:13:16.507]  It wasn't even, the keys weren't even in ignition.
[01:13:17.296 --> 01:13:20.442]  And basically what we did is an illegal search and seizure.
[01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:26.072]  And at that point I couldn't believe what I'd gotten myself into because I was... It was like the movie Training Day, Alex.
[01:13:26.072 --> 01:13:26.593]  Have you seen that?
[01:13:27.406 --> 01:13:30.607]  Yes, with Denzel Washington and Keanu Reeves.
[01:13:30.607 --> 01:13:35.148]  No, no, with Denzel Washington and what's the other guy's name?
[01:13:35.148 --> 01:13:35.588]  I forget.
[01:13:35.588 --> 01:13:37.349]  The point is... Yeah.
[01:13:37.349 --> 01:13:41.010]  It wasn't that graphic, obviously, but these gentlemen did have drugs on them.
[01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:44.531]  But the way we went about getting them is we compromised our integrity.
[01:13:44.531 --> 01:13:55.954]  So how are we supposed to be the upright peace officers in the community if we break the laws that we're sworn to protect to get that illegal drugs or whatever it has to be, you know?
[01:13:56.479 --> 01:14:15.061]  Well, what about the news footage of police tying chains to doors of pawn shops and jewelry shops, dragging off safes, police in Walmart stealing the goodies, and then it came out the police were ordered to shoot people who were trying to walk out of the Katrina zone in New Orleans.
[01:14:15.862 --> 01:14:16.963]  Well, thank God, Alex.
[01:14:16.963 --> 01:14:20.525]  I never witnessed any of that because that would have done it for me.
[01:14:20.525 --> 01:14:27.490]  But what I did witness is there was a lot of relief coming to the coast from all the good people around the country.
[01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:31.873]  And some of the first vehicles there to help with the disaster were Christian Relief Trucks.
[01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:36.391]  Well, that'll tell you a lot about people who love God and love Jesus.
[01:14:36.391 --> 01:14:37.772]  And they were there to help.
[01:14:37.772 --> 01:14:41.757]  But getting back to the corruption, the police officers kept everything at the top.
[01:14:41.757 --> 01:14:43.459]  The generators, the goods supplies.
[01:14:43.459 --> 01:14:46.282]  It never trickled down to the citizens.
[01:14:46.282 --> 01:14:49.125]  And, you know, I was a new police officer at that time.
[01:14:51.038 --> 01:14:54.861]  Now, you talk about a culture of corruption in the Gulf.
[01:14:54.861 --> 01:14:56.783]  You say you haven't seen that in Central Texas.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:31.438]  No, no I haven't Alex, and I have a lot of friends that are police officers here in Central Texas, and they're all upright family men, and they're all the kind of people that I would be happy to serve next to.
[01:15:32.677 --> 01:15:48.884]  Let's talk about the Fort Hood shooting because it came out in the news that day and the day after that there was a terror attack shooting drill and that a lot of people when he was reportedly running around shooting men and women in the military
[01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:50.718]  That's
[01:16:06.107 --> 01:16:07.548]  And to thumbprint them and face scan them.
[01:16:07.548 --> 01:16:10.451]  I have the video the Marines allowed us to tape of this.
[01:16:10.451 --> 01:16:26.665]  We know that similar system was used in Fallujah and other areas but that the day before they made all the troops at Fort Hood go and be put through the system that they'd been trained to put combatants through and that a lot of people in your unit and others thought it was very suspicious.
[01:16:27.759 --> 01:16:30.560]  Well, uh, obviously they couldn't force all the troops through Alex.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:36.421]  It was a directive put out, uh, three-quarter wide that, uh, everyone would receive the Phantom Warrior Pass.
[01:16:36.421 --> 01:16:40.462]  And with that pass, uh, you can enter the gate, uh, with your ID card.
[01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:43.443]  Just scan via a barcode scanner at the gate.
[01:16:43.443 --> 01:16:48.745]  And, uh, there still is an armed guard there to check your vehicle just to make sure there's no, uh, security issues.
[01:16:48.745 --> 01:16:52.286]  Uh, but, but I did go up there the day before on November the 4th.
[01:16:52.286 --> 01:16:56.867]  And, uh, when, uh, you know, everybody said they were gonna just take another picture and give you another ID card.
[01:16:57.587 --> 01:17:03.129]  And, uh, you know, I asked the woman behind the counter, I said, is this biographic, you know, or biometric technology?
[01:17:03.129 --> 01:17:05.450]  And she said, yes, you know, bat software.
[01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:07.271]  And, uh, I said, well, what is this for?
[01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:08.691]  And she says, well, I don't know.
[01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:12.733]  Uh, it just came across that everybody, you know, has to do it.
[01:17:12.733 --> 01:17:15.534]  So, uh, I don't know exactly what it's for.
[01:17:15.534 --> 01:17:21.656]  I don't necessarily like it, uh, just because it just, you know, that much more, the grid gets smaller, Alex.
[01:17:21.656 --> 01:17:24.117]  And, uh, you know, that's, that's never a good thing.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:39.901]  Joseph, you were saying that the men and women in your unit, though, were particularly concerned and that you talked to other people that were really spooked by what happened and thought it was suspicious that a drill was being run, and we talked about that off-air.
[01:17:41.482 --> 01:17:58.593]  Yeah, Alex, and once again, you know, the Department of Defense policies on this, I shouldn't probably comment too much on that, but what I will talk about is the fact that I serve with a lot of brave men and women, and they have really, just in the past couple years, along with myself,
[01:17:59.353 --> 01:18:03.975]  Uh, kind of just woken up to the fact that, uh, America isn't what it used to be.
[01:18:03.975 --> 01:18:08.616]  And, uh, you know, we need to, you know, take serious our oath, you know, like Oath Keepers.
[01:18:08.616 --> 01:18:10.597]  I think they're doing a great service.
[01:18:10.597 --> 01:18:19.179]  Uh, I think everybody, I think if you just, you know, take some, take some creed in your oath to God that you swore to protect the Constitution.
[01:18:19.179 --> 01:18:26.041]  And if you study the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and you hold dear to your heart, you know, and understand you made a covenant with the Lord to protect that.
[01:18:26.041 --> 01:18:28.422]  I think that's very important.
[01:18:29.503 --> 01:18:49.870]  Separately, we had a caller from Fort Hood who you told me you actually knew, and he called in and said, look, we, you know, I was in Iraq and there was the head of the Austin SWAT team and the head of intelligence were there learning how to set up cordons and martial law and basically door-to-door gun confiscation in Austin.
[01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:55.852]  And people didn't believe the call, but I search engined it and found the Fort Hood newspaper admitting it.
[01:18:56.292 --> 01:19:00.793]  You know, admitting that they were trained in Iraq and that city officials were out there being trained.
[01:19:00.793 --> 01:19:05.074]  And then you said that you talked to folks that were aware of that on the base.
[01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:05.634]  Right.
[01:19:05.634 --> 01:19:09.595]  One of my friends, whom I work with, he knew him personally.
[01:19:09.595 --> 01:19:10.915]  And he had worked with him.
[01:19:10.915 --> 01:19:13.716]  So he knew all about it.
[01:19:13.716 --> 01:19:16.337]  You know, once again, I didn't know too much about it.
[01:19:16.337 --> 01:19:18.857]  I just had secondhand information.
[01:19:18.857 --> 01:19:20.617]  But it does seem a little bit odd, Alex.
[01:19:20.617 --> 01:19:21.718]  It seems a little bit odd.
[01:19:23.331 --> 01:19:27.852]  You know, we just gotta keep our eyes and ears open, and we have to be good patriots.
[01:19:27.852 --> 01:19:37.234]  But bottom line, I mean, it's admitted that Austin police are being sent to Iraq to learn how to set up here what they've done there.
[01:19:37.234 --> 01:19:37.954]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:19:37.954 --> 01:19:41.015]  That was the front page of the Fort Hood newspaper, you know.
[01:19:41.015 --> 01:19:45.896]  If somebody's gonna call you a conspiracy theorist for claiming that, then obviously they're just, uh...
[01:19:46.576 --> 01:19:47.797]  They're willfully stupid.
[01:19:47.797 --> 01:19:48.937]  Alright Joseph, stay there.
[01:19:48.937 --> 01:19:49.678]  Final segment.
[01:19:49.678 --> 01:19:52.959]  Let's talk about what they're doing over at Fort Hood Stadium.
[01:19:52.959 --> 01:19:53.940]  Very bizarre.
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:56.241]  We went out and checked it out and what you told us was true.
[01:19:56.241 --> 01:19:57.721]  Barbed wire facing in.
[01:19:57.721 --> 01:19:58.562]  It's going up right now.
[01:20:00.643 --> 01:20:08.847]  Gulf War vets, 9-11 workers, people around the Gulf oil spill fumes, all were exposed to toxic chemicals in the air and became ill.
[01:20:08.847 --> 01:20:11.509]  Even in your home, air contamination can make you sick.

[01:20:18.973 --> 01:20:19.974]  Protect yourself.
[01:20:19.974 --> 01:20:22.255]  You cannot trust anyone to do it for you.

[01:22:00.928 --> 01:22:04.811]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:22:04.811 --> 01:22:06.212]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:22:06.212 --> 01:22:10.095]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:10.095 --> 01:22:12.998]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:12.998 --> 01:22:15.079]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:15.079 --> 01:22:17.221]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:18.422 --> 01:22:24.045]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:24.045 --> 01:22:26.566]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.

[01:23:00.069 --> 01:23:01.850]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:03.191]  How would that make you feel?
[01:23:03.191 --> 01:23:04.913]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:07.434]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:23:07.434 --> 01:23:15.020]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:16.501]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:23:16.501 --> 01:23:19.263]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:23:19.263 --> 01:23:24.566]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:29.610]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:23:29.790 --> 01:23:34.893]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:47.400]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:52.102]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:23:52.102 --> 01:23:55.564]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:24:05.066 --> 01:24:08.089]  Our top story's up there.
[01:24:08.089 --> 01:24:14.734]  PrisonPlanet.com, Barry Sotero, aka Barack Obama, political dynasty crashes and burns.
[01:24:14.734 --> 01:24:18.097]  We're going to make that the number one search term today with your help.
[01:24:18.097 --> 01:24:21.940]  Barry Sotero, S-O-E-T-O-R-O.
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:24.342]  Going back to Joseph.
[01:24:25.282 --> 01:24:26.884]  Army intelligence.
[01:24:26.884 --> 01:24:42.143]  Okay, tell folks about, and anybody can go see this, this isn't secret, they've put up a big fence around the old sports stadium with barbed wire facing in and it's also around the park and you've talked to some of the other military people out there and they think it's suspicious.
[01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:44.546]  We went out and looked at it Friday and confirmed what you told us.
[01:24:45.407 --> 01:24:46.328]  Right.
[01:24:46.328 --> 01:24:52.112]  Obviously, you know, any sort of barbed wire or constant penal wire on a military post, it happens all the time.
[01:24:52.112 --> 01:24:59.078]  So you never know when it's, you know, just a temporary POW camp, you know, for a mock exercise or something like that.
[01:24:59.078 --> 01:25:02.681]  But what this is, Alex, is they have $927 million.
[01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:05.303]  I'm reading straight from the Fort Hood Sentinel right now.
[01:25:05.899 --> 01:25:13.224]  $927 million center will include a three-story clinic and a three-story building that will house several developments.
[01:25:13.224 --> 01:25:20.029]  There will also be a five-story tower that will house emergency department, medical surgery center, and intensive care unit.
[01:25:20.029 --> 01:25:24.672]  Now this is, this hospital complex is being built right where Pritchett Stadium used to be.
[01:25:25.538 --> 01:25:33.542]  Now, what they have done is they have put up a fence around this facility, which is approximately, I'd say, around, you know, just under 10 acres.
[01:25:33.542 --> 01:25:38.204]  And it's backed up to a train depot where there's four sets of tracks and loading docks.
[01:25:38.204 --> 01:25:44.887]  Now, this permanent fencing that they've put in, they've cemented in the ground, has barbed wire facing in.
[01:25:44.887 --> 01:25:52.531]  Now, I haven't really talked to anybody about that, but it just seems a little bit odd to me, and some of the, you know, my co-workers just
[01:25:53.905 --> 01:25:57.027]  Yeah, to be clear, you said some of the other folks at the base thought it was suspicious.
[01:25:57.027 --> 01:25:58.387]  I mean, we've been there.
[01:25:58.387 --> 01:26:00.569]  There is the train tracks.
[01:26:00.569 --> 01:26:02.950]  It's a lot bigger than just where the hospital's going to be.
[01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:04.371]  It goes into where a park was.
[01:26:04.371 --> 01:26:07.232]  I mean, it's a huge area with barbed wire facing in.
[01:26:07.232 --> 01:26:14.036]  You can see them cementing it, putting the poles where it faces in with the three lines of barbed wire.
[01:26:14.036 --> 01:26:19.839]  I mean, why would you have the facility to where people can get in, they just can't get out?
[01:26:21.138 --> 01:26:32.209]  Well, uh, you know, Alex, I don't know, and, uh, you know, every day that I pray that there is an honest explanation, you know, that somebody made a mistake in the planning or execution phase or something like that.
[01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:39.276]  But, uh, we just have to be aware, Alex, and we have to keep, uh, keep passing this information through channels so everybody knows what's going on.
[01:26:40.524 --> 01:26:41.245]  Absolutely.
[01:26:41.245 --> 01:26:50.453]  But, I mean, if it's facing in, and it's not a mistake because they've been building it in the last month, I mean, they would have already reversed it.
[01:26:50.453 --> 01:26:57.640]  We have to continue to watch this facility, but it may be they're going to have a brig hospital, similar to the one where they're holding
[01:26:58.621 --> 01:27:01.642]  Holding the Fort Hood shooter right now.
[01:27:01.642 --> 01:27:10.383]  But I mean, take the Taylor facility, which is an admitted camp for illegal aliens and their families and citizens during emergencies.
[01:27:10.383 --> 01:27:11.743]  That's been admitted.
[01:27:11.743 --> 01:27:19.165]  When the public protested, they took down the guard towers and the Constantino wire, though the 20-foot fences are there and people are still held in it.
[01:27:19.165 --> 01:27:25.206]  So it shows that they try to camouflage this archipelago of prisons and jails as much as they can.
[01:27:26.653 --> 01:27:27.093]  Right.
[01:27:27.093 --> 01:27:32.816]  Alex, I wanted to touch on something that was real near and dear to my heart, so just bear with me.
[01:27:32.816 --> 01:27:39.159]  In the military, you guys out there, listen, you guys and girls, you do not have to be vaccinated.
[01:27:39.159 --> 01:27:43.261]  There is a religious objection, and it's contained in AR 40-562, chapter 2, page 3.
[01:27:46.623 --> 01:28:07.120]  I strongly urge any of you people out there that have a strong religious objection to abortive fetal tissue in the vaccines and squalene, between 80, all the stuff in there that's meant to kill your body and defile your temple, I strongly suggest you go and read the parameters inside AR40-562.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:13.306]  And if you veterans out there that have had any vaccinations, you know, I've had some adverse reactions to the anthrax vaccine.
[01:28:13.946 --> 01:28:16.109]  I contacted some people on the internet.
[01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:18.031]  It's Protecting Our Guardian.
[01:28:18.031 --> 01:28:20.954]  Just Google Protecting Our Guardian.
[01:28:20.954 --> 01:28:25.239]  And they're a great Christian organization, non-profit, and they helped me along the way.
[01:28:25.239 --> 01:28:28.763]  They're great people there, and there's great support all over on
[01:28:28.883 --> 01:28:34.326]  And by the way, they suspended the anthrax shot in the mid-90s, again in 2000, and again last year.
[01:28:34.326 --> 01:28:39.169]  They know it's experimental, but they lie to the troops and don't tell them there's a waiver.
[01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:41.611]  But you don't even need a waiver for an experimental vaccine.
[01:28:41.611 --> 01:28:46.193]  Congress and the courts have found it's illegal to give experimental vaccines to troops.
[01:28:46.193 --> 01:28:48.034]  Have you now seen Wired Magazine?
[01:28:48.034 --> 01:28:51.597]  They want to give you these vaccines that change your brain?
[01:28:51.597 --> 01:28:54.738]  Oh yeah, I read all about it.
[01:28:54.738 --> 01:28:56.159]  It's frightening.
[01:28:56.159 --> 01:28:57.280]  I mean, that's really scary.
[01:28:58.636 --> 01:29:05.860]  It's frightening, and I guarantee the first people to have those vaccines will be the men and women serving in the armed forces.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.260]  Yeah, you're not guinea pigs.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:12.143]  They want to go get guinea pigs, rodents, and do it, but not our men and women in the military.
[01:29:13.863 --> 01:29:15.724]  I agree Alex.
[01:29:15.724 --> 01:29:18.024]  It's something we should be able to object to.
[01:29:18.024 --> 01:29:18.665]  And I have.
[01:29:18.665 --> 01:29:19.965]  I wrote that letter.
[01:29:19.965 --> 01:29:21.986]  And my chain of command has been great with it.
[01:29:21.986 --> 01:29:23.746]  All the way up and down.
[01:29:23.746 --> 01:29:26.847]  And just really support my right to object religiously.
[01:29:26.847 --> 01:29:30.328]  And the more people that say no, the easier it is for everybody else.
[01:29:30.328 --> 01:29:33.709]  Well listen, Joseph, we appreciate you coming on the broadcast.
[01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:35.830]  Look forward to staying in touch with you.
[01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:36.190]  Take care.
[01:29:37.008 --> 01:29:37.708]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:29:37.708 --> 01:29:38.249]  God bless you.
[01:29:38.249 --> 01:29:38.909]  Have a great week.
[01:29:38.909 --> 01:29:39.950]  Vaya con Dios.
[01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:49.156]  All right, coming up via video uplink, if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, audio of your radio listener, Gerald Cilente for an hour and a half, and we're gonna have open phones for him.
[01:29:49.156 --> 01:29:50.797]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.797 --> 01:29:52.197]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.197 --> 01:29:54.719]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.719 --> 01:29:57.401]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.307 --> 01:30:05.290]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:30:05.290 --> 01:30:06.271]  What have we got?
[01:30:06.271 --> 01:30:08.733]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:30:08.733 --> 01:30:09.733]  A republic.
[01:30:09.733 --> 01:30:12.375]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:30:12.375 --> 01:30:14.636]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:30:14.636 --> 01:30:16.658]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:30:16.658 --> 01:30:18.359]  So they think they own our land?
[01:30:18.359 --> 01:30:19.660]  They think they own our water?
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:20.280]  Children?
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.401]  Our education?
[01:30:21.401 --> 01:30:22.241]  Our money?
[01:30:22.241 --> 01:30:25.884]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:30:26.244 --> 01:30:31.211]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:30:31.211 --> 01:30:32.232]  We have the facts.
[01:30:32.232 --> 01:30:33.393]  We have the Constitution.
[01:30:33.393 --> 01:30:34.315]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:30:34.315 --> 01:30:35.196]  We have common law.
[01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:37.719]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:37.719 --> 01:30:41.504]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:30:41.584 --> 01:30:46.548]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:30:46.548 --> 01:30:48.049]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:30:48.049 --> 01:30:49.149]  Don't tread on me.
[01:30:49.149 --> 01:30:56.014]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:31:00.137 --> 01:31:04.698]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.698 --> 01:31:05.619]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.619 --> 01:31:09.040]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:09.900]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:14.782]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.782 --> 01:31:15.522]  It's true.
[01:31:15.522 --> 01:31:20.403]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.403 --> 01:31:21.224]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.224 --> 01:31:24.805]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.805 --> 01:31:28.506]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.726 --> 01:31:29.507]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.507 --> 01:31:32.270]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:35.954]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.954 --> 01:31:36.755]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.755 --> 01:31:40.900]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:45.665]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:33:53.675 --> 01:33:53.975]  I don't know.

[01:36:47.998 --> 01:36:53.782]  We're excited to hear that Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy for the Treasury, Wall Street Journal editor, has joined the team.
[01:36:53.782 --> 01:36:55.283]  He announced that last week with us.
[01:36:55.283 --> 01:36:58.145]  TrendsResearch.com is the website.
[01:36:58.145 --> 01:37:06.011]  It's an invaluable report that everybody's got to get each month, and of course the intel reports that are on the site on a daily basis.
[01:37:06.011 --> 01:37:08.653]  Gerald Salente is a pioneer trends strategist.
[01:37:08.653 --> 01:37:11.676]  He's the author of the national bestseller Trends 2000 and Trends Tracking.
[01:37:12.496 --> 01:37:17.798]  Far better than Megatrends and publisher of the International Circulated Trends Journal newsletter.
[01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:18.899]  He's a political atheist.
[01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:22.620]  Gerald Salente is a political atheist, unencumbered by political dogma.
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:25.842]  And you can learn more, of course, at TrendsResearch.com.
[01:37:25.842 --> 01:37:27.362]  The proof is the past.
[01:37:27.362 --> 01:37:38.667]  Gerald Salente has earned his reputation as the most trusted name in trends by accurately forecasting hundreds of social, business, consumer, environmental, economic, political, entertainment, and technological trends among them.
[01:37:38.667 --> 01:37:40.268]  Gerald, great to have you joining us, sir.
[01:37:40.968 --> 01:37:43.550]  It's always great being on with you, Alex.
[01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:47.654]  Well, it's awesome having you, Gerald, with us here today.
[01:37:47.654 --> 01:37:53.779]  Going over all of this information, there's obviously a lot that I want to ask you.
[01:37:53.779 --> 01:37:56.361]  CNBC saying it's a depression, not a recession.
[01:37:56.361 --> 01:37:59.644]  The Federal Reserve coming out today and saying we are in deep trouble.
[01:37:59.644 --> 01:38:02.306]  We've got more of the same poison as the solution.
[01:38:02.306 --> 01:38:08.992]  But with everything happening, just break down the current trends and what you think is most important before I start asking questions.
[01:38:09.898 --> 01:38:14.161]  Well, they're admitting what we've been saying all along, that there would be no recovery.
[01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:17.182]  This isn't a double-dip recession.
[01:38:17.182 --> 01:38:19.344]  We never got out of the first dip.
[01:38:19.344 --> 01:38:29.750]  And we kept saying over and over and over that you cannot keep printing this phantom money out of thin air, backed by nothing and producing practically nothing.
[01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:30.871]  It was just a cover-up.
[01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:41.296]  Now, unfortunately, as we've also been saying all along, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[01:38:41.296 --> 01:38:45.618]  It's as almost though Orwell wrote the script.
[01:38:45.618 --> 01:38:52.602]  Last week, our esteemed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in, of all places, Vietnam.
[01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:54.747]  Can you imagine?
[01:38:54.747 --> 01:39:01.169]  In Vietnam, now the United States is making a military alliance with those Vietnamese.
[01:39:01.169 --> 01:39:02.750]  Remember how the U.S.
[01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:08.091]  government sent over some 60,000 of our soldiers to get slaughtered?
[01:39:08.091 --> 01:39:12.033]  That's how many were killed in the Vietnam War.
[01:39:12.033 --> 01:39:14.673]  Several hundred thousand ruined.
[01:39:14.673 --> 01:39:16.614]  Millions of Vietnamese killed.
[01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:19.276]  And now there, according to Ms.
[01:39:19.276 --> 01:39:31.584]  Clinton, our strategic ally, and the dispute going on between Vietnam and China over islands in the South China Sea, she said, quote,
[01:39:32.444 --> 01:39:36.387]  are of national US interest.
[01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:39.070]  No, they're not.
[01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:39.810]  They are.
[01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:49.438]  I am a national and they're not of my interest and I don't need her or any other flunky out there telling me what my interest is.
[01:39:49.438 --> 01:39:49.879]  Being that
[01:39:50.439 --> 01:39:52.261]  I pay for this stuff.
[01:39:52.261 --> 01:39:58.507]  So what they're doing is they're bringing us closer into wars all over the globe.
[01:39:58.507 --> 01:40:10.218]  And as we heard Fidel Castro say this past weekend, the Iranians are not going to tolerate the United States or a great
[01:40:10.478 --> 01:40:19.725]  Britain or any other flunky ally boarding their ships to see what's on board come September.
[01:40:19.725 --> 01:40:21.867]  They're setting us up for war.
[01:40:21.867 --> 01:40:24.749]  And I want to make this really clear, Alex.
[01:40:24.749 --> 01:40:27.811]  Anybody that's voting for war against Iran
[01:40:28.832 --> 01:40:44.049]  Let them pack up themselves, their wives and their kids and go fight the war and empty out your bank accounts and go support it and all these people that call themselves leaders
[01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:47.691]  Let them lead us into war!
[01:40:47.691 --> 01:40:55.534]  Let Hillary and Bill and little baby Chelsea and her husband, let them go to war!
[01:40:55.534 --> 01:41:02.357]  Let Pelosi, let Frank, let Bonner, let Bon, let McConnell, let them go to war!
[01:41:02.357 --> 01:41:04.038]  If they don't go to war,
[01:41:04.898 --> 01:41:18.549]  If these wankers on the Council on Foreign Affairs don't go to war, as these swivel-chaired generals yak it up on the media, don't go to war, then there's no war.
[01:41:18.549 --> 01:41:24.153]  Until they go, until they put their lives on the line, end the war.
[01:41:24.153 --> 01:41:26.595]  The wars are bankrupting this country.
[01:41:26.595 --> 01:41:27.555]  I heard that other
[01:41:28.616 --> 01:41:39.868]  Guy, that Krugman today, writing from the toilet paper of record, the New York Times, saying what's wrong with this country and what needs to be done to correct it.
[01:41:39.868 --> 01:41:47.516]  Not one inch, not one line of the wars that are draining the Treasury.
[01:41:47.856 --> 01:41:56.563]  And then you pick up today's newspaper, hey, the United States just did a $30 billion deal with Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:56.563 --> 01:41:59.045]  You know that wonderful democracy over there?
[01:41:59.045 --> 01:42:03.709]  $30 billion worth of planes being sold.
[01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:05.450]  It's all a racket.
[01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:05.570]  F-16s.
[01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:06.531]  Period.
[01:42:06.531 --> 01:42:07.232]  Paragraph.
[01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:34.074]  Well Gerald you're absolutely right and it's in the news but it's in the back of the paper that Israel is planning to strike Iran in the next three months and you would think this would be a bigger issue because every analyst out there agrees it runs from bad to worse at least doubling oil prices they'll use the war as a police state crackdown Obama will use it as a way to rally people around him going into the election
[01:42:34.694 --> 01:42:43.885]  It could easily trigger terror attacks in the United States and could trigger World War 3 with China and Russia, with Pakistan and India.
[01:42:43.885 --> 01:42:45.267]  They could go to war.
[01:42:45.267 --> 01:42:52.555]  Most analysts agree there's a good chance World War 3 could start and they're about to launch this and it's not even a major news item.
[01:42:52.555 --> 01:42:54.197]  Instead we're hearing about Lindsay Lohan.
[01:42:55.066 --> 01:42:58.949]  Well, again, this country's turned Snooki stupid!
[01:42:58.949 --> 01:43:00.910]  I heard Obama on The View.
[01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:04.132]  I had to watch this stuff to see what he says.
[01:43:04.132 --> 01:43:06.513]  And that's exactly what they're talking about.
[01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:20.583]  The President of the United States has nothing else to do with his time than to sit down with five gaggling women talking about Lindsay Lohan, Mel Gibson, and Snooki.
[01:43:21.263 --> 01:43:25.065]  The New York Times, again, the toilet paper of record.
[01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:28.927]  A whole big feature on Snooki.
[01:43:28.927 --> 01:43:31.949]  Why do we even know this stuff?
[01:43:31.949 --> 01:43:33.710]  It's perfect.
[01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:38.072]  Bread and circuses as the empire is declining.
[01:43:38.072 --> 01:43:44.376]  So when we go back to Iran, and we just put out a trend alert, you got it, about why Obama won't
[01:43:44.736 --> 01:43:48.458]  Won't debate with Ahmadinejad over these issues.
[01:43:48.458 --> 01:43:58.102]  I have to tell you, subscribers to the Trends Journal criticizing us for saying that, listen, why don't they debate?
[01:43:58.102 --> 01:44:05.046]  And people are going to once again be led into a fake war just as they did with Bush.
[01:44:05.726 --> 01:44:10.949]  And they're going to do it again with Obama in Iran, and you hit it perfectly.
[01:44:10.949 --> 01:44:23.196]  It will be another excuse to tighten up on the police state antics that are already in place, because after all, Alex, they're just doing it to protect us.
[01:44:23.196 --> 01:44:24.677]  Well, I mean, look at the nation.
[01:44:24.677 --> 01:44:28.900]  It's disintegrating from Ohio to California.
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:34.545]  Many cities are laying off and counties more than half their deputies are police.
[01:44:34.545 --> 01:44:37.789]  LA's announcing they're not going to fix many roads and sidewalks.
[01:44:37.789 --> 01:44:41.293]  They're announcing massive layoffs at the state and local level.
[01:44:41.293 --> 01:44:43.155]  Corporations are shutting down.
[01:44:43.155 --> 01:44:46.699]  They admit we're going into a depression, a double-dip recession.
[01:44:47.519 --> 01:45:00.787]  And then meanwhile, the federal government's hiring, they're increasing wages, the defense budget's going up, they're talking about $2 trillion in additional lending by banks that'll go on the taxpayer rolls.
[01:45:00.787 --> 01:45:05.609]  I mean, you can see this global elite using up the treasure of the empire.
[01:45:05.609 --> 01:45:07.670]  We're bankrupt.
[01:45:07.670 --> 01:45:15.435]  And they are showing that instead of slowing down, they're accelerating us towards financial and economic and military ruin.
[01:45:16.315 --> 01:45:21.357]  Again, you're right, and this isn't rhetoric.
[01:45:21.357 --> 01:45:23.477]  We just lost Gerald's audio.
[01:45:23.477 --> 01:45:32.460]  Joining us via New York, we'll get that hooked back up with him right now.
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:40.902]  Was that on our end or on his end, guys?
[01:45:40.902 --> 01:45:43.323]  That happens occasionally, you know, it's the wonders of video.
[01:45:44.482 --> 01:45:47.484]  While we're at it, let's get him to tip the camera down.
[01:45:47.484 --> 01:45:49.906]  Gerald Cilente, again, breaking all of this down with us.
[01:45:49.906 --> 01:45:52.668]  And next hour, we're gonna have the phones open.
[01:45:52.668 --> 01:45:54.029]  They're open now.
[01:45:54.029 --> 01:45:59.813]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:45:59.813 --> 01:46:01.434]  I mean, look at this economic news.
[01:46:01.434 --> 01:46:04.316]  Economic slowdown catches up with NASCAR.
[01:46:04.316 --> 01:46:05.677]  They're no longer jam-packed.
[01:46:05.677 --> 01:46:09.279]  They're seeing the tickets go way down in price and a lot smaller crowds.
[01:46:09.279 --> 01:46:11.201]  I mean, it's even affecting NASCAR.
[01:46:11.201 --> 01:46:12.802]  And the government's saying, let them eat cake.
[01:46:13.422 --> 01:46:14.663]  Everything's wonderful.
[01:46:14.663 --> 01:46:17.445]  We told you last week this was coming with Bob Chapman.
[01:46:17.445 --> 01:46:19.547]  Now here it is in the Financial Times of London.
[01:46:19.547 --> 01:46:22.168]  Fed set to downgrade U.S.
[01:46:22.168 --> 01:46:23.950]  Outlook for U.S.
[01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:31.355]  I mean, they knew full well that the stimulus was just going to lie in their pockets and there would need to be another one and another one.
[01:46:31.355 --> 01:46:36.539]  But all of this gets put back on the backs of the American people.
[01:46:36.539 --> 01:46:42.023]  But I wanted to read this headline to Gerald Cilente.
[01:46:44.222 --> 01:46:46.296]  And get his comment on it.
[01:46:47.759 --> 01:46:50.040]  Here's a CNBC headline from today.
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.840]  We are an equivalent of Great Depression.
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:47:04.464]  And they go on to list that the graphs for the stock market and the economy and for equities is identical from 29 to 33.
[01:47:04.464 --> 01:47:07.505]  And it took three years for them to admit we were in a depression.
[01:47:07.505 --> 01:47:11.106]  And now I'm seeing mainstream articles every day saying we're in a depression.
[01:47:11.106 --> 01:47:13.806]  But their answer is give the bankers more power.
[01:47:13.806 --> 01:47:15.587]  Let the Securities and Exchange Commission
[01:47:16.047 --> 01:47:16.508]  We're good.
[01:47:32.031 --> 01:47:58.729]  Congressmen fathers in prison for stealing 11 million from taxpayers and it's let them eat cake and you've got Marie Antoinette Michelle Obama Michelle Sotaro Running around on taxpayer money and Obama's having all these parties with rock stars and on the view And even mainstream media Gerald is saying what you were saying six months ago It's let them eat cake the New York Daily News had that headline that that they just don't care.
[01:47:58.729 --> 01:48:01.291]  They're rubbing in our faces They're laughing at us.
[01:48:01.291 --> 01:48:01.931]  They're arrogant
[01:48:03.072 --> 01:48:12.198]  Again, you know, before we got cut off, 90% of the wealth, 93% of the wealth is controlled by 10% of the nation.
[01:48:12.198 --> 01:48:14.860]  I mean, you know, I'm not making these numbers up.
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:19.904]  That means the rest of us are there to cut up that other 7%.
[01:48:19.904 --> 01:48:25.007]  We have 10 banks controlling 80% of the assets.
[01:48:25.007 --> 01:48:26.108]  It's a takeover.
[01:48:26.368 --> 01:48:28.669]  And I get a kick out of this, Alex.
[01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:36.314]  As you well know, we've been talking about the greatest depression since the crash happened in 2008.
[01:48:36.314 --> 01:48:53.405]  And everyone out there in the mainstream media either... The New York Times called what I'm doing, quote, pessimism porn, until their own flunkies start seeing it.
[01:48:54.165 --> 01:48:56.987]  And then it's genius analysis.
[01:48:56.987 --> 01:49:06.372]  When Krugman comes up with it, two years too late, and about 11 trillion dollars spent.
[01:49:06.372 --> 01:49:13.957]  And he had a false solution, give the Federal Reserve more money, give the Federal Reserve, the very crooks that orchestrated this, more power.
[01:49:14.554 --> 01:49:15.535]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:15.535 --> 01:49:19.659]  That's like you having a second mortgage and you're really in trouble.
[01:49:19.659 --> 01:49:22.623]  Hey Alex, how about a third mortgage?
[01:49:22.623 --> 01:49:24.264]  This thing is going under.
[01:49:24.264 --> 01:49:27.328]  Here's our message for everyone.
[01:49:27.328 --> 01:49:32.693]  Only the strong are going to survive this.
[01:49:32.693 --> 01:49:34.655]  You better be in shape, physically.
[01:49:35.376 --> 01:49:37.978]  Spiritually and emotionally.
[01:49:37.978 --> 01:49:45.003]  There's no salvation for these rest of the people that are waiting for their leaders to lead them.
[01:49:45.003 --> 01:49:46.864]  The game is over.
[01:49:46.864 --> 01:49:56.570]  They're going to keep conning the people every time there's a bit of rosy economic news to make it appear that things are okay.
[01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:59.712]  You better start planning now for the winter.
[01:49:59.712 --> 01:50:05.156]  There could not be a better grasshopper and ant scenario in place.
[01:50:06.217 --> 01:50:06.357]  Yes.
[01:50:06.357 --> 01:50:13.745]  And they're not lying about the economy and telling you things are getting better so that we have better confidence.
[01:50:13.745 --> 01:50:18.349]  They're doing it so we politically don't get angry and take control of our government.
[01:50:18.349 --> 01:50:19.070]  It's our country.
[01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:20.271]  It's our republic.
[01:50:20.271 --> 01:50:23.274]  And put in policies that would have averted and fixed this.
[01:50:23.274 --> 01:50:27.158]  But I know you and many other experts say that it's now too far gone.
[01:50:27.158 --> 01:50:28.179]  We're going into the ground.
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.221]  We're going into the ground.
[01:50:30.221 --> 01:50:34.484]  There's only, to me, there are a couple of things that could be done.
[01:50:34.484 --> 01:50:47.852]  And one of them, again, I've said this about a new alternative energy, something bigger than wind, solar, geothermal, biofuel, just like we had the internet revolution that got us out of the 1990s mess.
[01:50:47.852 --> 01:50:50.914]  And number two, we have to start making...
[01:50:53.353 --> 01:50:54.534]  All right, we're going to break, Gerald.
[01:50:54.534 --> 01:50:56.275]  We're going to break and we'll get him reconnected.
[01:50:56.275 --> 01:50:57.695]  We'll be right back with Gerald Cilente.

[01:52:01.018 --> 01:52:02.319]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.319 --> 01:52:07.923]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.923 --> 01:52:12.927]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.927 --> 01:52:18.511]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.511 --> 01:52:20.332]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:52:20.592 --> 01:52:21.112]  We're good to go!

[01:52:57.707 --> 01:53:00.090]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseabank.com.

[01:54:34.713 --> 01:54:37.836]  Gerald Salente is our guest all the way to the end of the next hour.
[01:54:37.836 --> 01:54:41.978]  We'll have open phones next hour after we have some more time to talk with Gerald.
[01:54:41.978 --> 01:54:46.602]  We're having a few breakups via our video connection, but we're very honored to have him.
[01:54:46.602 --> 01:54:48.002]  Here's some really bad news.
[01:54:49.023 --> 01:54:53.467]  Rand Paul is seen as the leader of the true Tea Party movement right now.
[01:54:53.467 --> 01:54:54.869]  They've pulled out the stops.
[01:54:54.869 --> 01:54:59.473]  They had a video feed where he couldn't hear them with a two-second delay.
[01:54:59.473 --> 01:55:02.936]  And they said, do you support repealing the Civil Rights Act?
[01:55:02.936 --> 01:55:05.319]  And he said, yes, yes, I can't hear you.
[01:55:05.319 --> 01:55:06.480]  Yes, I can hear you now.
[01:55:07.639 --> 01:55:09.799]  And then he said, no, I don't agree with getting rid of it.
[01:55:09.799 --> 01:55:11.020]  Now, that's a quote.
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:14.500]  Then they took his yes, yes, now I can hear you.
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:17.321]  He was having problems just like Gerald is with a connection.
[01:55:17.321 --> 01:55:24.703]  And they ran with the headline, he wants to get rid of the Civil Rights Act, and that was a national hoax.
[01:55:24.703 --> 01:55:26.703]  Now, I don't mean to divert.
[01:55:26.703 --> 01:55:33.044]  I want to get into the other ways he's saying we can protect ourselves and more of his trends forecast has been so devastatingly accurate.
[01:55:33.044 --> 01:55:34.845]  Here's the horrible news, though.
[01:55:34.845 --> 01:55:35.765]  Washington Post
[01:55:36.693 --> 01:56:00.684]  GQ Magazine, woman says Rand Paul kidnapped her in college, tried to force her to take bong hits, and folks, I'll bet you my bottom dollar, you know, we've got Al Gore with the semen-stained clothing with this other woman and that's being covered up, but with Rand Paul, this is just, this is un... Gerald, we're going to see more and more desperate stuff like this, aren't we?
[01:56:00.684 --> 01:56:05.507]  Yeah, yeah, that sounds like a story they could have read about me, and it might have been true.
[01:56:10.598 --> 01:56:11.098]  Oh boy.
[01:56:11.098 --> 01:56:11.678]  You know what?
[01:56:11.678 --> 01:56:13.079]  This interview is so important with Gerald.
[01:56:13.079 --> 01:56:20.301]  We're now going to just go to regular phone line with him and get his take on this while we're reconnecting.
[01:56:20.301 --> 01:56:21.842]  Skype's a wonderful technology.
[01:56:21.842 --> 01:56:27.044]  You can have him up there in clear living color for the video viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv, but we're having problems.
[01:56:27.044 --> 01:56:28.224]  We're going to go to phone line now.
[01:56:28.904 --> 01:56:29.504]  Here it is.
[01:56:29.504 --> 01:56:35.087]  GQ Woman says Rand Paul kidnapped her in college, tried to force me to take bong hits.
[01:56:35.087 --> 01:56:43.591]  Rand Paul's educational experience was under scrutiny last week when the Lexington Herald reported that the doctor never got a bachelor's degree.
[01:56:43.591 --> 01:56:44.911]  And that's not true.
[01:56:44.911 --> 01:56:50.134]  He left Baylor University in Texas when Duke accepted him in medical school.
[01:56:50.774 --> 01:57:01.338]  Well, a lot of people don't know that a lot of doctors and people, they already have, they're in college, they have high grade scores, they can be accepted to a medical school, and the medical schools do that.
[01:57:01.338 --> 01:57:07.661]  He went on, it says, and they've also claimed that he hasn't kept his license up, which is not illegal, but they claim it's a problem.
[01:57:07.661 --> 01:57:12.323]  Now GQ has an article on Paul's college years that is likely to raise more questions.
[01:57:12.323 --> 01:57:14.424]  Do we have Gerald back?
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:22.764]  The strangest episode of Paul's time at Baylor occurred one afternoon in 83, so they're reporting it as if it's true.
[01:57:22.764 --> 01:57:31.709]  Although memories about all these events are understandably a bit hazy, so the date might be slightly off when he was a Nozay brother, a fellow member of a secret society.
[01:57:32.529 --> 01:57:38.051]  And so now they're spinning being in a regular fraternity as a secret society, just all crafted to make his base hate him.
[01:57:38.051 --> 01:57:45.574]  A fellow member of a secret society, Nosee Brotherhood, paid a visit to a female student who was one of Paul's teammates at the Baylor swim team.
[01:57:45.574 --> 01:57:55.137]  According to this woman, who requested anonymity, oh that's another big red flag, because of her current job as a clinical psychologist, oh give me a break, another one of those people.
[01:57:55.137 --> 01:58:00.159]  He said, ran, came to my house, knocked on my door, and then blindfolded me, tied me up, and put me in the car.
[01:58:00.839 --> 01:58:03.922]  They took me to their apartment and tried to force me to take bong hits.
[01:58:03.922 --> 01:58:05.263]  They've been smoking pot.
[01:58:05.263 --> 01:58:11.970]  After the woman refused to smoke with them, Paul and his friend put her back in the car and drove her to the countryside over Waco, where they stopped near a creek.
[01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:17.936]  They told me that their god was Aqua Buddha, and that they needed to bow down and worship him, the woman recalls.
[01:58:17.936 --> 01:58:22.160]  They blindfolded me and made me bow down to Aqua Buddha in the creek.
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:23.762]  I had to say I worshipped Aqua Buddha.
[01:58:24.082 --> 01:58:35.769]  This looks like it's been made up and written, tailored, secret societies, aqua buddha, bong hits, like it was tailor made with some woman who won't even say who she is.
[01:58:35.769 --> 01:58:43.795]  This is desperate type activity, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:59:53.445 --> 01:59:55.827]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.827 --> 01:59:58.630]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.393 --> 02:00:10.237]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.237 --> 02:00:11.798]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.798 --> 02:00:13.359]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.359 --> 02:00:17.562]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.562 --> 02:00:21.605]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.226 --> 02:00:27.028]  Okay, Gerald Solente with us for the full hour coming up at the 20 after.
[02:00:27.028 --> 02:00:32.412]  We're going to take calls for the entire two-thirds of the hour that's left.
[02:00:32.412 --> 02:00:35.013]  But going back to Gerald, Gerald, you got cut off.
[02:00:35.013 --> 02:00:38.436]  You were getting into some of the solutions, some of the ideas.
[02:00:39.296 --> 02:00:51.389]  Uh, as we go into this greatest oppression, and then you were also commenting on this new fraternity stunt thing that they're trying to claim was Rand Paul kidnapping people, uh, but they're not even giving the woman's name.
[02:00:51.389 --> 02:00:52.851]  Sounds very, very suspicious.
[02:00:53.257 --> 02:00:55.098]  Well, it's really pretty stupid, too.
[02:00:55.098 --> 02:00:55.738]  I mean, come on.
[02:00:55.738 --> 02:01:01.840]  You know, a guy wanting a girl to take some hits of a bong when he's in college?
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:02.460]  Who doesn't?
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:03.141]  I mean, really.
[02:01:03.141 --> 02:01:04.461]  I mean, what is this?
[02:01:04.461 --> 02:01:06.962]  Ozzie and Harry to leave it to Beaver Week?
[02:01:06.962 --> 02:01:08.463]  Let's get real over here.
[02:01:08.463 --> 02:01:10.423]  They're making a big deal out of this one.
[02:01:10.423 --> 02:01:14.565]  Hey, how about those people in those white shirts and ties?
[02:01:15.606 --> 02:01:24.872]  You think he could get upset about that a little bit?
[02:01:24.872 --> 02:01:36.160]  Hey, how about a predator drone in a Pakistani's backyard who had nothing to do with you and wiping out the family, and they're talking about a couple of bomb hits?
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:44.705]  How about all these psychotic drugs that these psychopaths are on that they're selling through Pfizer and all the rest of them?
[02:01:44.705 --> 02:01:47.486]  And they're talking about a couple of bongets?
[02:01:47.486 --> 02:01:49.707]  These guys are a disgrace.
[02:01:49.707 --> 02:01:51.949]  They call themselves the media?
[02:01:51.949 --> 02:01:57.232]  How about calling yourself a little puppet?
[02:01:57.232 --> 02:01:57.792]  Continue.
[02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:08.991]  Well, what we're saying here, Alex, is that when the elections come up in November, there's not going to be any change yet.
[02:02:08.991 --> 02:02:15.338]  Because going to the Republicans from the Democrats, it's a two-headed, one-party system.
[02:02:15.338 --> 02:02:17.561]  You know, people ask me, who would I vote for?
[02:02:18.769 --> 02:02:27.980]  And I say, on the social issues, in terms of the environment, clean food, and those kind of things, I would vote for Ralph Nader.
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:34.127]  On terms of the economy, not becoming involved in foreign entanglements, a Ron Paul.
[02:02:34.948 --> 02:02:37.769]  And that's what this country is looking for.
[02:02:37.769 --> 02:02:41.790]  Not these... You want me to talk about centrist parties?
[02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:43.871]  We don't have centrist parties.
[02:02:43.871 --> 02:02:46.932]  We have radical fascist parties.
[02:02:46.932 --> 02:02:48.252]  Here's an example.
[02:02:48.252 --> 02:02:59.396]  You know that wonderful little story that came out last week about in Portland, Oregon, how they closed down a seven-year-old's lemonade stand?
[02:02:59.396 --> 02:03:00.676]  Yes, I did see that report.
[02:03:01.158 --> 02:03:02.879]  Well, listen to the language.
[02:03:02.879 --> 02:03:13.987]  This is from the guy who we pay money to, taxpayers, Joe Kawaguchi, Environmental Health Inspector.
[02:03:13.987 --> 02:03:18.551]  He said, we have to put the public's health first.
[02:03:19.111 --> 02:03:30.859]  And this is the guy they're talking about in Portland, Oregon, a lemonade stand must be licensed under state law, said Eric Pippitt.
[02:03:30.859 --> 02:03:41.906]  How about Puppet, the foodborne illness prevention program manager for the state's public health division, both county inspectors, and here he goes.
[02:03:41.906 --> 02:03:48.611]  When you go to a public event and set up a shop, you're suddenly engaging in commerce.
[02:03:49.091 --> 02:03:53.894]  The fact that you're small-scale, I don't think that's relevant.
[02:03:53.894 --> 02:03:57.155]  Our role is to protect the public.
[02:03:57.155 --> 02:04:05.300]  Hey, how about that millions of pounds of E. coli-tainted beef that just went out into the public?
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:07.081]  Here's the deal, Alex.
[02:04:07.081 --> 02:04:12.364]  You crash down on squeezing lemonade kids seven years old,
[02:04:12.944 --> 02:04:15.945]  He let the big guys take a free ride.
[02:04:15.945 --> 02:04:22.688]  The Tysons, the ConAgras, the Con Games, from the too big to fails.
[02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:24.309]  So this is what it's all about.
[02:04:24.309 --> 02:04:29.831]  This story is a perfect representation of where the country's going.
[02:04:29.831 --> 02:04:31.272]  Squeeze the little people.
[02:04:31.792 --> 02:04:53.579]  Well that's like last year in Sacramento, twice armed agents went to a car wash about a four cent unpaid federal tax bill, but then for ten plus years, the insiders told the Securities and Exchange Commission exactly what Bernie Madoff was doing, stealing close to a hundred billion.
[02:04:53.579 --> 02:04:57.541]  Stay there Gerald Cilente, let's get into more of your trends on the other side.

[02:06:04.531 --> 02:06:05.792]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:05.792 --> 02:06:09.655]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.655 --> 02:06:11.957]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:11.957 --> 02:06:17.821]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:17.821 --> 02:06:24.046]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.486 --> 02:06:30.470]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:34.633]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:06:34.633 --> 02:06:38.936]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:38.936 --> 02:06:44.880]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:48.443]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.443 --> 02:06:50.404]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.404 --> 02:06:50.845]  It's here.

[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:10.821]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:07:10.821 --> 02:07:18.203]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:07:18.203 --> 02:07:23.084]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:07:26.947 --> 02:07:28.209]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[02:07:42.769 --> 02:07:46.653]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:07:53.038 --> 02:07:54.239]  Thank you!
[02:08:09.207 --> 02:08:10.788]  We are on the march.
[02:08:10.788 --> 02:08:14.030]  The empire is on the run.
[02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:17.712]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:20.216 --> 02:08:22.577]  FriendsResearch.com is his website.
[02:08:22.577 --> 02:08:27.198]  Our sites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:08:27.198 --> 02:08:32.180]  You know, Gerald, if you just joined us, just brought up the lemonade stand in Portland, Oregon.
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:35.281]  These little girls, six and seven, they wanted $150 from them.
[02:08:35.281 --> 02:08:36.821]  It's the mafia.
[02:08:36.821 --> 02:08:45.944]  But then I was mentioning the more famous cases out there where the IRS visits with armed agents twice saying, pay your four-cent bill at a car wash.
[02:08:45.944 --> 02:08:49.345]  And it's been admitted even in the Wall Street Journal that in the last decade,
[02:08:50.265 --> 02:08:55.189]  They've shifted the IRS to focus on blue collar, not even white collar.
[02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:57.851]  So you got the crooks in the system trying to protect themselves.
[02:08:57.851 --> 02:09:07.738]  And Gerald mentioned how Tyson and others, they can have literally in some cases, hundreds of times the violations of even other big companies, but they're allowed to operate.
[02:09:07.738 --> 02:09:11.260]  Same thing with BP in Houston and Texas City.
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:14.202]  And here's the headline, Tyson's profit surges.
[02:09:15.163 --> 02:09:17.046]  While everybody else's goes down.
[02:09:17.046 --> 02:09:20.251]  So it shows how it's a big boys game.
[02:09:20.251 --> 02:09:22.955]  It's a monopoly game, Gerald Cilente.
[02:09:23.777 --> 02:09:27.000]  It is, and it's becoming more and more like that.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:34.365]  I said this since the beginning, as people have been complaining about Obama and calling him a socialist and a communist.
[02:09:34.365 --> 02:09:37.748]  I said it's fascism, a merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:09:37.748 --> 02:09:39.629]  You just look at the numbers, they're all there.
[02:09:39.629 --> 02:09:41.211]  Pick the sector.
[02:09:41.211 --> 02:09:44.693]  Realistically, the banking sector, as I mentioned.
[02:09:44.693 --> 02:09:47.175]  10 banks control 80% of the action.
[02:09:47.175 --> 02:09:48.817]  You look at agriculture.
[02:09:48.817 --> 02:09:51.759]  A couple of big firms control most of the business.
[02:09:51.759 --> 02:09:52.820]  You look at drugs.
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:54.420]  Go down the line.
[02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:55.380]  Retail.
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:58.121]  You know, Walmart is taking over the country.
[02:09:58.121 --> 02:10:01.282]  Every sector, they're squeezing out the little people.
[02:10:01.282 --> 02:10:16.265]  And all the regulations are being tilted, as you mentioned, whether it's the IRS or the sales tax people going door-to-door to pizza places and beauty parlors, shaking them down for every last cent, whether letting the big criminals run free.
[02:10:16.265 --> 02:10:17.965]  And you know, you mentioned about the Clintons.
[02:10:18.625 --> 02:10:28.911]  And this guy, this Goldman Sachs guy she married, you know the Trends Research Institute began in Rhinebeck where they got married in 1980.
[02:10:28.911 --> 02:10:35.155]  And we left Rhinebeck about three years ago because the neighborhood started going bad.
[02:10:35.155 --> 02:10:37.576]  People like the Clintons started coming up there.
[02:10:38.766 --> 02:10:43.468]  It was all of these people that think they're better than everybody else.
[02:10:43.468 --> 02:10:46.769]  Because after all, Alex, you see it.
[02:10:46.769 --> 02:10:52.991]  Any place they arrive in a foreign country, they're waving from the top of their jumbo jet.
[02:10:52.991 --> 02:11:00.673]  And by the time they get down the gangplank, they have bowing dignitaries and a red carpet rolled out.
[02:11:01.033 --> 02:11:02.335]  I'm not kidding you.
[02:11:02.335 --> 02:11:06.961]  We left Rhinebeck because the place got a bit too white for me.
[02:11:06.961 --> 02:11:17.155]  And it was all of these arrogant people, the kind, you know, that go to the Hamptons, started finding a different location, you know, that was north in the country.
[02:11:17.655 --> 02:11:23.760]  And these are the people, it's on and on again, that they actually believe that they're entitled.
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:27.843]  And it's just like Michelle Obama going to Spain.
[02:11:27.843 --> 02:11:33.667]  How could anybody with any dignity put on such a spectacle like that?
[02:11:33.667 --> 02:11:39.552]  You know, if you're going to go on a vacation, do it quietly, rather than disrupting everything around you.
[02:11:39.952 --> 02:11:45.075]  And they demanded that entire beaches be shut down so she could frolic around with her girls.
[02:11:45.075 --> 02:11:46.676]  This is the new royalty.
[02:11:46.676 --> 02:11:56.642]  But the good news is, Barry Sotaro, aka Barack Obama, has the lowest approval rating now of any president in history at this point, and they're in free fall.
[02:11:57.242 --> 02:11:57.962]  I don't know.
[02:12:18.129 --> 02:12:43.056]  So they're raising the taxes as all of the basic services are being removed or restricted, and they're slapping toll roads on major roads to give the profits to foreign offshore corporations, and they just think this gravy train's gonna go on forever, and now they want to start a new war that'll further bankrupt us, and now they're having to admit we're going into a depression, and you've said you see it really breaking out by the end of this year.
[02:12:43.056 --> 02:12:44.677]  How do you see the dominoes falling?
[02:12:45.382 --> 02:12:48.823]  It looks as a currency crisis to us.
[02:12:48.823 --> 02:12:50.263]  That's what we're looking at.
[02:12:50.263 --> 02:12:52.944]  But again, there are so many wild cards.
[02:12:52.944 --> 02:13:02.567]  For example, in September, if the United States and its flunky allies begin to board or attempt to board Iranian ships,
[02:13:03.067 --> 02:13:09.191]  That could be the kind of thing that really throws the world economy into a death spiral.
[02:13:09.191 --> 02:13:10.712]  Look what's going on right now.
[02:13:10.712 --> 02:13:13.014]  Again, these are the things you can't predict.
[02:13:13.014 --> 02:13:22.940]  What's going on in Russia with this horrible heat wave and really the destruction of so much of its wheat crop.
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:28.804]  And then you look at what's going on in a lot of Asia, particularly Pakistan, with all of these floods.
[02:13:29.384 --> 02:13:38.053]  So you have a button and then of course in the United States with our own disasters man-made by BP, which of course everything's okay now.
[02:13:38.053 --> 02:13:40.836]  And by the way, this is important, Alex.
[02:13:40.836 --> 02:13:45.420]  You look what's going on in Russia, in Pakistan, what's going on in the U.S.
[02:13:46.141 --> 02:13:53.805]  In every instance, you're hearing the people complaining about how unresponsive the governments are.
[02:13:53.805 --> 02:13:55.906]  They're going crazy right now in Russia.
[02:13:55.906 --> 02:13:57.307]  They're firing people.
[02:13:57.307 --> 02:13:58.888]  Same thing in Pakistan.
[02:13:58.888 --> 02:14:03.570]  And, of course, we see with the Katrina Quality Rescue skills in the U.S.
[02:14:03.570 --> 02:14:07.032]  Here's what every thinking adult has to grow up to.
[02:14:08.027 --> 02:14:12.451]  There's nobody there to lead you or to save you.
[02:14:12.451 --> 02:14:15.234]  I don't care what country it is.
[02:14:15.234 --> 02:14:27.866]  Governments by their nature are run by people that are basically sociopaths that are only interested in their own power and could care less about you and their incompetence.
[02:14:28.386 --> 02:14:31.547]  They've never worked a day in their life, most of them.
[02:14:31.547 --> 02:14:36.748]  They've only learned how to game the system to get a cushy political job.
[02:14:36.748 --> 02:14:43.449]  So when we crash before 2010 happens, people better be prepared for it.
[02:14:43.449 --> 02:14:46.430]  They better be able to weather this storm.
[02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:56.632]  Because if there's a war with Iran, as you well mentioned, you're going to see oil prices skyrocket, you're going to see gold prices go through the roof,
[02:14:57.052 --> 02:15:06.522]  You're going to see hyperinflation, and you're going to see the government crack down on the people like you could never imagine.
[02:15:06.522 --> 02:15:14.791]  And we've seen the build-up for this police state, and they now admit, we want to use the army, we want to use the Marine Corps against you, we're going to federalize your local towns.
[02:15:15.471 --> 02:15:20.573]  The establishment, the ruling rats, the ruling class, they've been preparing for this.
[02:15:20.573 --> 02:15:24.095]  They knew what happened 10 years ago when they started selling these derivatives.
[02:15:24.095 --> 02:15:25.275]  They knew what was going to happen.
[02:15:25.275 --> 02:15:35.139]  You could look at it four or five years ago and forecast the collapse of 2008 and further forecast that we weren't in a recovery, we were just continuing the collapse.
[02:15:35.139 --> 02:15:39.320]  So they know what they're doing, but I think they've miscalculated that they're going to get away with it.
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:42.782]  They thought Obama could be sold as this messianic leader.
[02:15:43.382 --> 02:15:51.290]  But Humpty Dumpty has fallen off the wall, and the next Republican savior they give us, unless it's Ron Paul, isn't going to be able to reverse this.
[02:15:51.290 --> 02:15:58.798]  So, I happen to agree with you, and unfortunately, most of the other analysts are now agreeing with you, that it's going to get bad.
[02:15:58.798 --> 02:16:03.323]  But you're saying pretty soon, I mean, how bad will this collapse get?
[02:16:04.051 --> 02:16:08.513]  It'll be, we're going to see, look at the unemployment numbers already.
[02:16:08.513 --> 02:16:10.214]  What did we just lose?
[02:16:10.214 --> 02:16:13.715]  Another 131,000 jobs were lost in July.
[02:16:13.715 --> 02:16:15.016]  And what do we have to do?
[02:16:15.016 --> 02:16:19.238]  We have to create 1.25 million a year just to stay even.
[02:16:21.779 --> 02:16:27.523]  The June numbers were revised to 221,000.
[02:16:27.523 --> 02:16:29.804]  221,000 lost from 125,000.
[02:16:29.804 --> 02:16:37.989]  They just keep lying and they say that the unemployment rate is only 9.5%.
[02:16:37.989 --> 02:16:39.690]  Yet people drop off the list.
[02:16:39.690 --> 02:16:41.471]  They're no longer getting unemployment.
[02:16:41.471 --> 02:16:43.132]  They're no longer counted.
[02:16:43.132 --> 02:16:44.333]  Who can make this up?
[02:16:44.333 --> 02:16:47.755]  We're going to see unemployment worse than the Great Depression.
[02:16:48.215 --> 02:16:53.843]  We're going to see people that are incapable, unlike the Great Depression, of taking care of themselves.
[02:16:53.843 --> 02:16:59.210]  We're going to see crime at levels that they're not going to be able to deal with.
[02:16:59.210 --> 02:17:06.580]  And I hear all of these white-shoe boy guys from Harvard, Princeton, Yale trying to convince the people.
[02:17:07.358 --> 02:17:16.849]  There's no correlation between people losing everything, having no jobs, losing their houses, and increases in crime.
[02:17:16.849 --> 02:17:18.270]  You know, what am I, six years old?
[02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:19.151]  You talking to me?
[02:17:19.151 --> 02:17:21.935]  You know, tell this to some stupid kid in high school.
[02:17:23.134 --> 02:17:28.558]  Well, even their economic numbers that are showing things worsening are admittedly cooked.
[02:17:28.558 --> 02:17:36.144]  And then for the last year they said, don't worry, there's no radiation from the naked body scanners and we're not saving the images and we don't see your genitals.
[02:17:36.144 --> 02:17:41.589]  And now it turns out they got mobile vans with it, federal, state courthouses, the airports.
[02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:44.591]  They were saving it all from the beginning and lying.
[02:17:44.591 --> 02:17:47.554]  I mean, that shows an arrogance and a hubris.
[02:17:48.234 --> 02:17:54.826]  Or a chutzpah that is just off the charts, Gerald, for them to knowingly lie about everything.
[02:17:54.826 --> 02:17:58.412]  I mean, it's certainly getting worse.
[02:17:58.412 --> 02:18:01.337]  I mean, I guess if they've told a million lies, why not tell a million more?
[02:18:02.009 --> 02:18:02.650]  Exactly.
[02:18:02.650 --> 02:18:21.884]  You know, I was just on Fox this past week, and there was this guy from Washington, I forgot, and I was saying how bad things are going to get, and this guy comes out and starts saying, well, you know, in 1983, we were in a very similar situation, and the United States ingenuity don't underestimate the American worker.
[02:18:21.884 --> 02:18:23.125]  That's what got us out of it.
[02:18:23.125 --> 02:18:23.866]  I said, listen, this isn't 1983.
[02:18:23.866 --> 02:18:24.886]  In 1983, there was a Soviet Union.
[02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:32.712]  We didn't have all of this world trade with China.
[02:18:32.712 --> 02:18:34.813]  It was still Communist China.
[02:18:34.813 --> 02:18:37.655]  They weren't eating up the global marketplace.
[02:18:37.655 --> 02:18:39.976]  These are very different times.
[02:18:39.976 --> 02:18:41.898]  And what do we have, Alex?
[02:18:41.898 --> 02:18:45.420]  We have a bunch of experts in the past.
[02:18:45.900 --> 02:18:52.263]  They keep touting about how brilliant Bernanke is, and a scholar of the Great Depression.
[02:18:52.263 --> 02:18:54.063]  This isn't the Great Depression.
[02:18:54.063 --> 02:18:56.504]  This is 2010.
[02:18:56.504 --> 02:19:06.268]  And we have a bunch of incompetents that are leading this nation down the drain, selling it out, and mark my words, they're leading us to war.
[02:19:06.268 --> 02:19:12.951]  And whether it's going through Israel or somewhere else, we're going to see war coming soon.
[02:19:15.137 --> 02:19:20.082]  And they know that and they need that as a political diversion and they know we're bankrupt.
[02:19:20.082 --> 02:19:23.086]  They know globalism has decimated our industry.
[02:19:23.086 --> 02:19:25.709]  They know this isn't 1983.
[02:19:25.709 --> 02:19:34.718]  And they count on the American people laying down and watching Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and Tyson and all these insiders.
[02:19:36.021 --> 02:19:42.087]  Get richer at our expense, but we see the major political realignment taking place.
[02:19:42.087 --> 02:19:44.130]  Everything you've predicted now unfolding.
[02:19:44.130 --> 02:19:49.916]  We're going to come back with Gerald Cilente and hear your questions, your comments for our guest.
[02:19:49.916 --> 02:19:50.737]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:50.737 --> 02:19:54.020]  This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNlive.com.
[02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:54.441]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.899 --> 02:20:10.122]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:10.122 --> 02:20:13.463]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[02:20:13.463 --> 02:20:23.267]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:20:23.267 --> 02:20:26.168]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness.
[02:20:26.348 --> 02:20:28.809]  Survival skills and off-the-grid living.
[02:20:28.809 --> 02:20:31.290]  Off-the-grid news is fiercely independent.
[02:20:31.290 --> 02:20:42.095]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.

[02:24:06.121 --> 02:24:11.067]  Got some other news we'll be talking about before he leaves us with Gerald Cilente, the Top Trends Forecaster.
[02:24:11.067 --> 02:24:13.530]  Right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:24:13.530 --> 02:24:16.414]  Brian in Tennessee, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:24:16.414 --> 02:24:17.715]  Go ahead.
[02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:20.279]  Hi Alex, hello Mr. Cilente.
[02:24:20.279 --> 02:24:20.759]  Hello Brian.
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:25.161]  I've got about three points I want to touch on real quick.
[02:24:25.161 --> 02:24:29.002]  The first two I want to talk to Mr. Salente and Alex, I want to talk to you about the Constitution.
[02:24:29.002 --> 02:24:35.224]  That's the last point being my most important, so don't let me go too quickly.
[02:24:35.224 --> 02:24:37.405]  Mr. Salente, I just wanted to talk to you about the
[02:24:39.185 --> 02:24:52.115]  Oh illegal immigration problem the 30 million illegals in this country that are working Many of which are getting paid under the table that are not on record with the IRS.
[02:24:52.115 --> 02:24:53.696]  They're not getting taxed for their labor
[02:24:54.855 --> 02:25:09.192]  I want to ask you, sir, do you think that that would be a large percentage added to our unemployment rate if we knew how many millions of these illegals were working and getting paid under the table?
[02:25:09.192 --> 02:25:10.333]  How far up do you think that would be?
[02:25:10.433 --> 02:25:12.874]  And let me throw this caveat into the question.
[02:25:12.874 --> 02:25:19.276]  They're enforcing on lemonade stands and car washes for four cents, but the illegals are basically left alone.
[02:25:19.276 --> 02:25:24.578]  So that's kind of a quasi-legal black market via selective enforcement.
[02:25:24.578 --> 02:25:29.560]  And the illegals can come here and have their baby here and have it paid for by taxpayers.
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:31.761]  At one hospital in Dallas this year, 11,071 babies
[02:25:34.102 --> 02:25:39.828]  Born to be legals who become citizens and most of the births it was free, paid for by tax money.
[02:25:39.828 --> 02:25:41.689]  That's the Dallas Morning News.
[02:25:41.689 --> 02:25:42.991]  Gerald, your comments on that?
[02:25:43.755 --> 02:25:54.141]  Well, you know, obviously we just don't have the jobs to support all these illegal immigrants, and this is a global issue, by the way.
[02:25:54.141 --> 02:26:04.227]  You name the country, France, Italy, Spain, every country is facing this huge problem of trying to get rid of illegal aliens.
[02:26:04.227 --> 02:26:07.209]  And by the way, this is old news to us.
[02:26:07.209 --> 02:26:10.731]  We wrote in Trends 2000, I wrote that book in 1996,
[02:26:13.292 --> 02:26:19.279]  About the huge illegal alien problem that was going to confront the United States.
[02:26:19.279 --> 02:26:23.905]  And there was a whole story about migration being a threat to global stability.
[02:26:23.905 --> 02:26:26.428]  And here's the key in all this.
[02:26:26.428 --> 02:26:28.270]  Do you know who encouraged it?
[02:26:29.227 --> 02:26:34.052]  Try people like the National Association of Manufacturers.
[02:26:34.052 --> 02:26:36.514]  Try people like Microsoft.
[02:26:36.514 --> 02:26:44.823]  It was all of these people that encouraged the opening of our borders to bring in cheap labor to keep wages down so their profits could go up.
[02:26:45.243 --> 02:26:46.063]  Period.
[02:26:46.063 --> 02:26:46.884]  Paragraph.
[02:26:46.884 --> 02:26:49.105]  It has nothing to do with human rights.
[02:26:49.105 --> 02:26:52.827]  It has nothing to do with being compassionate.
[02:26:52.827 --> 02:26:54.747]  It had to do with the bottom line.
[02:26:54.747 --> 02:26:56.548]  We saw the problem coming.
[02:26:56.548 --> 02:26:57.769]  We wrote about it.
[02:26:57.769 --> 02:27:07.653]  And once again, you know, it's a question between, when you look at the mainstream media, political correctness and pettiness.
[02:27:07.653 --> 02:27:09.274]  And that's the way they treat these issues.
[02:27:09.758 --> 02:27:09.818]  Yes.
[02:27:30.117 --> 02:27:35.799]  Including $600,000 just in one gift.
[02:27:35.799 --> 02:27:43.622]  $6,661,000 in another gift to literally fund the breakdown of this country.
[02:27:43.622 --> 02:27:45.062]  And now we go bankrupt.
[02:27:45.062 --> 02:27:46.763]  They're laying off the police.
[02:27:46.763 --> 02:27:48.383]  The hospitals are going bankrupt.
[02:27:48.383 --> 02:27:49.764]  Every day I see it.
[02:27:49.764 --> 02:27:52.165]  And we're told, you don't want government-run health care?
[02:27:52.165 --> 02:27:52.845]  You're a racist.
[02:27:52.845 --> 02:27:54.906]  You don't want to pay for people's free babies?
[02:27:54.906 --> 02:27:56.006]  I don't get to go.
[02:27:56.006 --> 02:27:58.067]  Every time I've had three children, I pay money.
[02:27:58.667 --> 02:28:00.028]  I pay a lot of money!
[02:28:00.028 --> 02:28:02.709]  I mean, this isn't fair, Gerald!
[02:28:02.709 --> 02:28:03.650]  Here's from Trends 2000.
[02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:04.990]  Again, this is 1995 I wrote this.
[02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:10.593]  77% of the people surveyed in a 1994 Times CNN poll felt that governments were not doing enough to keep out illegal immigrants.
[02:28:21.235 --> 02:28:30.289]  This has been a huge issue, and the only reason they haven't been doing anything, again, let's just call it what it is, is to undercut the labor market with cheap labor.
[02:28:31.661 --> 02:28:34.062]  Which doesn't help the economy, it destroys the base.
[02:28:34.062 --> 02:28:37.704]  It destroys everything because it brings down the whole standard of living.
[02:28:37.704 --> 02:28:56.571]  It's like buying, it's like trying to tell people how wonderful it is to go to Walmart to save three cents on something because it's getting made in China and we don't have to have those dirty manufacturing jobs that used to pay high wages and instead now you've become a service sector society.
[02:28:56.571 --> 02:29:00.393]  Think of the word, I say this all the time, you break out the word surf.
[02:29:01.233 --> 02:29:02.293]  Servant.
[02:29:02.293 --> 02:29:03.214]  Servitude.
[02:29:03.214 --> 02:29:12.797]  We went from a country of craftsmen, a country of merchants, a country of, of, of, of mom and pop businesses and manufacturers.
[02:29:12.797 --> 02:29:14.137]  And now look what we've become.
[02:29:14.137 --> 02:29:16.478]  Cashiers, shelf stockers, and clerks.
[02:29:16.818 --> 02:29:17.799]  Brian, I've got to move quick.
[02:29:17.799 --> 02:29:18.500]  What was your other point?
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:19.221]  Because we've got to go to Bright.
[02:29:19.221 --> 02:29:20.482]  We'll come back and answer it.
[02:29:20.482 --> 02:29:23.285]  Well, I want to... I had two points.
[02:29:23.285 --> 02:29:23.926]  Is that okay?
[02:29:23.926 --> 02:29:24.326]  No!
[02:29:24.326 --> 02:29:24.546]  Go!
[02:29:24.546 --> 02:29:25.227]  Okay, alright.
[02:29:25.227 --> 02:29:25.848]  One point.
[02:29:25.848 --> 02:29:32.215]  I just want to say that I admire Joseph for bringing up the Constitution because the only way that we're going to defeat is not big government.
[02:29:32.695 --> 02:29:41.083]  Everybody knows that the secret societies like the Illuminati have run this world since ancient Egypt, but the only way that we can defeat them is through the Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[02:29:41.083 --> 02:29:51.172]  Americans have to be educated about the Ninth and Tenth because in the Ninth, it says that your rights are permanent, they cannot be taken away because executives... Hey, I hear you, Brian!
[02:29:51.172 --> 02:29:52.554]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.554 --> 02:29:55.076]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.076 --> 02:29:57.758]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.386 --> 02:30:06.347]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:06.347 --> 02:30:15.209]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:15.209 --> 02:30:19.830]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:30.652]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:30:31.272 --> 02:30:40.795]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:40.795 --> 02:30:46.217]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:30:46.217 --> 02:30:53.700]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:53.700 --> 02:30:56.121]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:00.233 --> 02:31:04.776]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.776 --> 02:31:05.697]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.697 --> 02:31:09.119]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.119 --> 02:31:09.980]  Number 2.
[02:31:09.980 --> 02:31:14.863]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.863 --> 02:31:15.623]  It's true.
[02:31:15.623 --> 02:31:20.487]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.487 --> 02:31:21.307]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.307 --> 02:31:24.889]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.889 --> 02:31:28.592]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.792 --> 02:31:29.592]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.592 --> 02:31:32.353]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.353 --> 02:31:36.034]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.034 --> 02:31:36.834]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.834 --> 02:31:40.975]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.975 --> 02:31:46.017]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.017 --> 02:31:50.198]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.198 --> 02:31:51.979]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:59.901 --> 02:32:03.042]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:32:03.042 --> 02:32:06.843]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:32:06.843 --> 02:32:09.724]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:32:09.724 --> 02:32:14.646]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[02:32:57.417 --> 02:33:09.719]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.617 --> 02:33:15.358]  Okay, I want to race through your phone calls.
[02:33:15.358 --> 02:33:19.540]  I wasn't trying to be rude to Brian, but we spent one segment with him on a key issue.
[02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:20.601]  That's why we're taking your calls.
[02:33:20.601 --> 02:33:24.062]  You bring up important topics, but I want to give everybody a chance.
[02:33:24.062 --> 02:33:28.144]  Michelle, Michael, Jeff, Kelly, John, and others.
[02:33:28.144 --> 02:33:29.424]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:33.126 --> 02:33:42.548]  Gerald, before we go any further, because you never toot your own horn, it really is invaluable information on your website and, of course, in the newsletter.
[02:33:42.548 --> 02:33:45.908]  And big corporations, small businesses, individuals subscribe to it.
[02:33:45.908 --> 02:33:47.109]  It's very affordable.
[02:33:47.109 --> 02:33:48.969]  How do people subscribe to the Trends Journal?
[02:33:48.969 --> 02:33:53.950]  I know there's TrendsResearch.com, but how do they get the quarterly report?
[02:33:53.950 --> 02:33:59.011]  Well, they go to our Trends Journal login, and they have all the information there.
[02:33:59.011 --> 02:34:00.571]  And I want to make this very clear.
[02:34:01.258 --> 02:34:04.760]  We make the Trends Journal available to virtually everyone.
[02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:08.161]  Regardless, we know a lot of people are having very difficult times.
[02:34:08.161 --> 02:34:13.363]  So there's a discount request form for all those that are having a difficult time.
[02:34:13.363 --> 02:34:16.445]  Because what we're facing here, Alex, is that
[02:34:17.946 --> 02:34:21.009]  The Trends Journal, as you well know, it's not about fear.
[02:34:21.009 --> 02:34:22.791]  It's about empowerment.
[02:34:22.791 --> 02:34:28.137]  So what we do is we have trend posts, suggestions to take, directions to go.
[02:34:28.137 --> 02:34:31.882]  And right now, people really have to start thinking in those terms.
[02:34:32.442 --> 02:34:45.357]  And particularly, all these kids that got out of college, that are deep in debt, that are never going to be able to pay it off, by declaring bankruptcy, because they're not allowed to.
[02:34:45.357 --> 02:34:50.703]  What direction they need to go in now, to really secure their future.
[02:34:50.703 --> 02:34:52.465]  And they have to get out of their houses.
[02:34:52.805 --> 02:34:58.151]  They have to start breaking the strings for their parents and really moving out on their own.
[02:34:58.151 --> 02:35:04.056]  And what we see is there's a great opportunity now to rejuvenate this country.
[02:35:04.056 --> 02:35:14.427]  You can buy houses in major cities that aren't Detroit's that are in much better shape for virtually what you can buy a used car for.
[02:35:15.147 --> 02:35:18.732]  And now is the time to start getting out on your own.
[02:35:18.732 --> 02:35:22.977]  But also, as I hear, that getoffthegrid.com.
[02:35:22.977 --> 02:35:25.981]  Those kind of things and actions to take.
[02:35:25.981 --> 02:35:33.671]  So the Trends Journal is an overview of what's going on and how you can prepare for the future before it hits you.
[02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:36.992]  And more and more, it's not just lemonade stands being harassed.
[02:35:36.992 --> 02:35:49.580]  Every week I see articles of people selling eggs in the country, watermelons, squash, onions, and they have undercovers that come and buy it from them, then arrest them for supposedly not paying a few dollars of taxes.
[02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:59.506]  You can see the system hates the grassroots and hates individuals trying to just tread water and be self-sufficient, but then the illegal aliens and
[02:36:00.306 --> 02:36:04.950]  800 plus sanctuary cities, they're allowed to drunk drive, mug people, whatever.
[02:36:04.950 --> 02:36:09.433]  This government hates the blue-collar working people.
[02:36:09.433 --> 02:36:14.697]  Unless you're on welfare, they want you dependent on them as a voting bloc, or they want you in prison.
[02:36:15.407 --> 02:36:19.571]  We have aristocratic criminals, that's all it is.
[02:36:19.571 --> 02:36:23.114]  It's a new aristocratic criminal class.
[02:36:23.114 --> 02:36:30.902]  And it's the Bush administration, it was the Clinton administration, and now it's the Obama administration.
[02:36:30.902 --> 02:36:33.744]  It's the two-headed, one-party system.
[02:36:33.744 --> 02:36:34.285]  And by the way,
[02:36:35.936 --> 02:36:37.417]  By the way, you're right, Gerald.
[02:36:37.417 --> 02:36:49.664]  If you study feudalism, whether it was in Japan or Europe in the last 600, 700 years, feudalism is about turning resources off to the general public to make them poor and dumbed down to control them.
[02:36:49.664 --> 02:36:51.185]  I mean, this is admitted.
[02:36:51.185 --> 02:36:53.126]  The globalists with their carbon taxes.
[02:36:53.126 --> 02:36:54.767]  It's not about helping the environment.
[02:36:54.767 --> 02:37:01.051]  It's about them being a mafia and being able to say who can have a factory, who can have a business, who can have a job.
[02:37:01.051 --> 02:37:02.672]  And then if you're on the inside crew,
[02:37:03.252 --> 02:37:10.016]  Of the Harvard boys, the Princeton boys that you talk so much about, then you can do whatever you want and not follow any regulations.
[02:37:10.016 --> 02:37:17.780]  But if you're a red-blooded American, regardless of what color you are or what religion, you try to start a company or something, they harass you out of existence.
[02:37:18.396 --> 02:37:25.682]  Exactly, and the people that are the enforcers are just merely the flunkies for the big guys.
[02:37:25.682 --> 02:37:27.743]  I may have told you this story.
[02:37:27.743 --> 02:37:37.271]  I began my career as the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate at a graduate school after putting on campaigns in Westchester County.
[02:37:37.271 --> 02:37:41.855]  It was the worst job I ever had, to watch grown men sucking up.
[02:37:41.855 --> 02:37:43.456]  That's all it is.
[02:37:43.456 --> 02:37:45.858]  So in order for them to preserve their jobs,
[02:37:46.258 --> 02:37:54.026]  They have to make sure they're bringing in the dough, and they bring in the dough by fining the little people.
[02:37:54.026 --> 02:38:05.639]  Whether it's the cop out there that's watching you go over that double yellow line, or whether it's, again, going into the pizza joint to make sure you paid all your sales tax.
[02:38:06.019 --> 02:38:06.199]  I think?
[02:38:24.873 --> 02:38:26.494]  It's about kissing up.
[02:38:26.494 --> 02:38:29.315]  They want to destroy America to make us dependent on them.
[02:38:29.315 --> 02:38:30.596]  It's a world government.
[02:38:30.596 --> 02:38:32.157]  It's a new world order.
[02:38:32.157 --> 02:38:34.558]  These people are scam artists.
[02:38:34.558 --> 02:38:36.799]  It's about who you know, not who you are.
[02:38:36.799 --> 02:38:38.980]  And they want to destroy the middle class.
[02:38:38.980 --> 02:38:43.102]  I mean, that's a big deal to have Limbaugh finally start sounding like Gerald Celente or Alex Jones.
[02:38:43.447 --> 02:38:46.650]  Well, you know what these guys do, Alex.
[02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:51.315]  They pick up on what we say, and then they milk it, whether they believe it or not.
[02:38:51.315 --> 02:38:54.479]  Because he's one of them, and he keeps sucking up to them.
[02:38:54.479 --> 02:38:55.860]  You know, so that's what they do.
[02:38:55.860 --> 02:38:57.502]  I've been around this game long enough.
[02:38:58.215 --> 02:39:00.457]  And it's good media for them.
[02:39:00.457 --> 02:39:01.658]  But no one could deny it.
[02:39:01.658 --> 02:39:07.504]  Now look, I'm getting these calls about people writing now about the Second American Revolution.
[02:39:07.504 --> 02:39:17.293]  Yeah, pick up the, what was it, the Autumn 2009 Trends Journal, the headline, The Second American Revolution.
[02:39:17.293 --> 02:39:18.074]  No, it's here.
[02:39:18.074 --> 02:39:20.877]  And this is the other thing, and it's so true.
[02:39:21.537 --> 02:39:30.699]  Forget the big lie that all you have to do in America is work hard and put your nose to the grindstone and you're going to make it to the top.
[02:39:30.699 --> 02:39:31.599]  Yeah, you can.
[02:39:31.599 --> 02:39:34.219]  And you can also win the lotto.
[02:39:34.219 --> 02:39:36.040]  Yeah, some people do.
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:47.342]  But the reality is the only reason that these guys make several hundred million dollars a year is because they're members of the club and they're doing the inside deals.
[02:39:48.336 --> 02:40:09.512]  We're gonna go to calls but you're absolutely right on that front and something you've talked about for a decade was the college bubble and now I've suddenly seen it's got to be 10 or 15 in the last two weeks big top magazines reporting you know college won't get you a job most degrees are worthless
[02:40:10.032 --> 02:40:22.563]  So now I guess they're getting ready to pop that bubble, telling mom and dad that sunk a hundred grand into a four-year education that sorry, your little sweetheart, your little delicate genius is going to be bagging groceries.
[02:40:22.563 --> 02:40:27.487]  Meanwhile, the guy that started mowing lawns 20 years ago, he's living in a half-million-dollar house.
[02:40:27.487 --> 02:40:34.713]  Or the artisan that knows how to put in wood molding, he's living in a half-million-dollar house because he knows how to bust his butt, not go to college.
[02:40:35.695 --> 02:40:46.598]  Again, you know, you've heard me say this again, you know, they're catching up to us, and it's a waste of money unless you're going for a degree that's going to pay a return on investment.
[02:40:46.598 --> 02:40:58.720]  I read this story, and this woman, she's $100,000 in debt, went to NYU, and I'm slaving through this rotten story to find out, I wonder what she took.
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:03.182]  You know, she took women's history and religion.
[02:41:03.182 --> 02:41:04.962]  You went to college for that?
[02:41:06.229 --> 02:41:09.892]  I mean, she could have sat there and read 20 books and gotten the same knowledge.
[02:41:09.892 --> 02:41:10.772]  Exactly.
[02:41:10.772 --> 02:41:12.173]  And become an apprentice.
[02:41:12.173 --> 02:41:16.076]  Start getting out there and go the old way it used to be.
[02:41:16.076 --> 02:41:19.719]  Don't waste your money on a degree in business administration.
[02:41:19.719 --> 02:41:20.039]  That's right.
[02:41:20.039 --> 02:41:26.484]  Find a company where you can work hard, where you've got upward mobility, where you get rewarded for smarts and hard labor.
[02:41:26.484 --> 02:41:32.568]  Folks, this country was built on people busting their butts, not on working for mega global corporations.
[02:41:32.568 --> 02:41:34.069]  Let's talk to Michael in Florida.
[02:41:34.069 --> 02:41:34.950]  You're on the air, Michael.
[02:41:36.391 --> 02:41:37.212]  Hey Alex.
[02:41:37.212 --> 02:41:37.952]  Hey buddy.
[02:41:37.952 --> 02:41:40.914]  Hey Mr. Celente.
[02:41:40.914 --> 02:41:48.399]  I want to thank y'all for at least talking to people, caring enough, and sticking to what's important.
[02:41:48.399 --> 02:41:53.363]  Because you have a lot of times I heard you talking to people who disagree.
[02:41:53.363 --> 02:41:57.686]  A lot of times people just want to say red because you said blue.
[02:41:58.266 --> 02:42:00.627]  You say the sky is blue, they'll say it's red.
[02:42:19.787 --> 02:42:22.249]  Ignoring the truth doesn't make it go away.
[02:42:22.249 --> 02:42:23.290]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:23.290 --> 02:42:30.576]  And a lot of people, you know, you have to beat them with the truth because a lot of times people come against you when you're telling the truth.
[02:42:30.576 --> 02:42:33.218]  Your truth is your sword against them.
[02:42:33.218 --> 02:42:45.608]  Now, their sword is, you know, based off what you're saying, they're going to try to pervert it and turn it around, everything that you're saying, but you have to keep beating them in the face with the truth because that's where they run from.
[02:42:46.108 --> 02:42:49.849]  Yeah, I don't care what anybody says, just so you know that.
[02:42:49.849 --> 02:42:52.469]  People say to me, you know this one, they say, what do I care?
[02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:54.470]  I don't care what they think.
[02:42:54.470 --> 02:42:59.411]  We go with the motto of the Trends Research Institute, is think for yourself.
[02:42:59.411 --> 02:43:01.531]  We don't tell anybody what to think.
[02:43:01.531 --> 02:43:04.892]  We just put the facts down and we give our analysis.
[02:43:04.892 --> 02:43:06.673]  And nobody tells me what to think.
[02:43:06.673 --> 02:43:08.233]  If they disagree with the facts,
[02:43:08.713 --> 02:43:10.493]  I'll debate them on that.
[02:43:10.493 --> 02:43:16.215]  But, you know, again, being a political atheist, it's not what you wish, what you want, or what you hope for.
[02:43:16.215 --> 02:43:17.475]  It's just what is.
[02:43:17.475 --> 02:43:27.577]  And what is now is that we believe that 20% of the people in this country that aren't suck-ups or sold-out could change the direction of this country.
[02:43:27.577 --> 02:43:38.119]  It's a time for rejuvenation to bring back the best of what used to be and stop listening to all these people that can tell you what it could be if you keep following their course
[02:43:39.059 --> 02:43:39.699]  Exactly.
[02:43:39.699 --> 02:43:40.760]  Michael, great points.
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:41.840]  Jeff in Texas.
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:46.302]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilenti.
[02:43:46.302 --> 02:43:48.362]  Jeff, your phone doesn't have its audio turned on.
[02:43:48.362 --> 02:43:49.483]  I can hear you mumbling barely.
[02:43:49.483 --> 02:43:51.343]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:43:51.343 --> 02:43:52.744]  Let's move on.
[02:43:52.744 --> 02:43:53.744]  Kelly in Georgia.
[02:43:53.744 --> 02:43:55.845]  Kelly, you're on the air.
[02:43:55.845 --> 02:43:56.785]  Yes.
[02:43:56.785 --> 02:43:57.666]  Hi, gentlemen.
[02:43:57.666 --> 02:44:00.427]  Gerald, two things.
[02:44:00.427 --> 02:44:07.329]  Could you please speak a little bit about the future of IRAs, 401Ks, and the like as far as whether
[02:44:08.283 --> 02:44:12.865]  You foresee any government takeover and also speak on some privacy issues.
[02:44:12.865 --> 02:44:18.728]  What can we do to have some semblance of privacy in our personal and financial lives?
[02:44:18.728 --> 02:44:20.129]  Or is it a lost cause?
[02:44:20.129 --> 02:44:21.850]  I mean, I'm a law-abiding citizen.
[02:44:21.850 --> 02:44:27.573]  I don't do anything wrong, but there's been instances that have been occurring with census people and
[02:44:28.757 --> 02:44:29.817]  It's becoming very apparent.
[02:44:29.817 --> 02:44:30.238]  No, no.
[02:44:30.238 --> 02:44:33.178]  They're training you that we're going to put you through naked body scanners.
[02:44:33.178 --> 02:44:34.899]  We're going to come ask you questions.
[02:44:34.899 --> 02:44:36.539]  We're going to set up checkpoints.
[02:44:36.539 --> 02:44:37.939]  It's part of training you.
[02:44:37.939 --> 02:44:40.200]  Great points.
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:43.681]  Let's get Gerald Salente's comments on what you asked.
[02:44:43.681 --> 02:44:46.782]  Well, first off, I don't do any online banking.
[02:44:46.782 --> 02:44:51.183]  And I do as little online and giving my private information out as possible.
[02:44:51.183 --> 02:44:55.864]  And I think anybody that does online banking and gets hit, you deserve what you get.
[02:44:56.718 --> 02:44:57.938]  And that's number one.
[02:44:57.938 --> 02:45:06.561]  Number two, it's like Alex said, the more power they keep losing, the more rights they're going to continue to take away from us.
[02:45:06.561 --> 02:45:09.662]  So everyone really has to become active at every level.
[02:45:09.662 --> 02:45:13.904]  And again, we believe that 20% of the people could change the course.
[02:45:13.904 --> 02:45:17.565]  Because right now, we're following the 80 dumbed down.
[02:45:17.565 --> 02:45:19.546]  So it's that kind of thing.
[02:45:19.546 --> 02:45:26.168]  And when you go back to this whole thing about this body scanning at airports, what brought it all about?
[02:45:27.469 --> 02:45:30.312]  It was from some underwear barma?
[02:45:30.312 --> 02:45:31.554]  You know, come on.
[02:45:31.554 --> 02:45:35.157]  Who was the guy that was touting this stuff on television?
[02:45:35.157 --> 02:45:36.479]  That guy Jerk?
[02:45:36.479 --> 02:45:37.220]  Jerk-off?
[02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:39.482]  The, the, uh... Jerk- what?
[02:45:39.482 --> 02:45:40.783]  How do you pronounce his name, Alex?
[02:45:40.783 --> 02:45:42.085]  His name is Jerk-off.
[02:45:42.085 --> 02:45:44.047]  Uh, yeah, he was a former head of Homeland Security.
[02:45:44.047 --> 02:45:45.809]  Uh, Mr. Jerk-off.
[02:45:46.129 --> 02:45:48.010]  Yeah, there he is.
[02:45:48.010 --> 02:45:52.972]  He's the guy that was also a front for the companies selling the machines.
[02:45:52.972 --> 02:45:55.513]  I mean, how could anybody be so stupid?
[02:45:55.513 --> 02:46:02.895]  Well, they ordered him a year before the underwear bombing that I had the lawyer on who was on board the plane, and it turned out everything he said was true.
[02:46:02.895 --> 02:46:03.916]  The U.S.
[02:46:03.916 --> 02:46:08.317]  government, CIA, ordered the State Department to let him on the plane.
[02:46:08.317 --> 02:46:11.298]  It was all staged, and it even came out in mainstream news.
[02:46:11.298 --> 02:46:15.260]  But here's another question going along with what Kelly
[02:46:15.900 --> 02:46:35.947]  I was asking you, dealing with this, what about Bloomberg two weeks ago admitting that every major insurance company is now tricking people and stealing the widows of dead vets from Iraq and Afghanistan, stealing $400,000, half a million, a million dollar settlements, and just keeping the money.
[02:46:35.947 --> 02:46:40.549]  And they're so arrogant, Bloomberg reported, they send them a fake checkbook that's a trick.
[02:46:40.549 --> 02:46:41.349]  When they sign it,
[02:46:42.521 --> 02:46:45.385]  It signs away their money and it said prudential.
[02:46:45.385 --> 02:46:53.696]  I mean, it just shows you and then now they're announcing, oh, the government's ordering private pension funds to invest in failed banks.
[02:46:53.696 --> 02:46:55.258]  So they're already stealing the money.
[02:46:55.868 --> 02:46:57.069]  Yes, they are.
[02:46:57.069 --> 02:47:05.635]  And on the question of will the government become involved in taking over pension funds, etc., they're capable of doing anything.
[02:47:05.635 --> 02:47:15.341]  And unfortunately, I have to put money in IRAs because of tax purposes, so for my retirement program, or else I wouldn't at all.
[02:47:15.341 --> 02:47:18.924]  And you know me, I don't believe in investing in stocks.
[02:47:19.524 --> 02:47:23.789]  And I only invest in gold and different currencies.
[02:47:23.789 --> 02:47:30.337]  And my currencies are only hedges against one going up and the other going down, so I preserve my wealth.
[02:47:31.667 --> 02:47:35.670]  We're going to go to break in the final segment of Jam In Calls from John, Dan, and Tony.
[02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:40.313]  We may even get to one of them now, but I want to roll some video for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[02:47:40.313 --> 02:47:42.015]  For radio, I'll talk over it.
[02:47:42.015 --> 02:47:52.322]  This is about two hours ago when Obama arrived in town, and you see the dozens of motorcycles, scores of vehicles, the highway shut down.
[02:47:53.223 --> 02:48:00.367]  For the emperor to arrive in Austin, Texas, and they've shut down much of downtown.
[02:48:00.367 --> 02:48:06.470]  He's going to be speaking a little bit after 2 at the UT Gregory Gym at 2 p.m.
[02:48:06.470 --> 02:48:08.071]  There's a protest down there against him.
[02:48:08.071 --> 02:48:11.893]  There's also some of his zombies who want a free lunch down there, so I suggest folks
[02:48:12.393 --> 02:48:12.653]  I think?
[02:48:28.704 --> 02:48:28.904]  I think?
[02:48:59.425 --> 02:49:02.927]  It shows the awakenings happening, but anything can happen after that.
[02:49:02.927 --> 02:49:05.649]  Let's go back to George W. Bush.
[02:49:05.649 --> 02:49:10.191]  Remember how people looked at him in the polls before 9-11?
[02:49:10.191 --> 02:49:13.073]  He was the incompetent that people thought he was.
[02:49:13.073 --> 02:49:20.298]  But all of a sudden, he becomes the decider-in-chief, creates this war on terror, and people start believing this guy.
[02:49:20.898 --> 02:49:22.920]  So anything can happen, Alex.
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:26.843]  If there's a terrorist strike, and we believe there's going to be, considering U.S.
[02:49:26.843 --> 02:49:33.688]  foreign policy, if there's a war, you know it's not going to be as though the United States deserves it.
[02:49:33.688 --> 02:49:37.991]  It's going to look like another Gulf of Tonkin incident, where it's fabricated.
[02:49:37.991 --> 02:49:45.496]  And then we've got to get behind him, and we've got to do everything he says, government, healthcare, police, state, because he's our Big Daddy.
[02:49:45.496 --> 02:49:46.017]  You got it.
[02:49:46.852 --> 02:49:48.533]  And you were trying to say something uninterrupted?
[02:49:48.533 --> 02:49:50.153]  No, no, that was it.
[02:49:50.153 --> 02:49:54.195]  They'll make it seem as though that they're protecting us.
[02:49:54.195 --> 02:49:57.636]  And that the people will rally around him.
[02:49:57.636 --> 02:50:00.237]  They do it all the time and they know it.
[02:50:00.237 --> 02:50:04.998]  These manipulators in the White House are not stupid.
[02:50:04.998 --> 02:50:06.779]  They're very shrewd.
[02:50:06.779 --> 02:50:09.280]  And they know it will pull the people's heartstrings.
[02:50:17.081 --> 02:50:32.944]  Well, they're even bragging, Robert Shapiro and the Financial Times and others, saying he must have an Oklahoma City or 9-11, or he's politically destroyed, he needs this to look strong.
[02:50:32.944 --> 02:50:37.225]  Well, then who has the motive to stage the terror attack if they're admitting this will help them, Gerald?
[02:50:38.154 --> 02:50:46.082]  Well, whether it's motivated or not, it's certainly, I will say this, uncategorically, it's instigated.
[02:50:46.082 --> 02:50:46.823]  Very good points.
[02:50:46.823 --> 02:50:48.985]  Final segment with Gerald Cilente straight ahead.
[02:50:48.985 --> 02:50:50.647]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:50:50.647 --> 02:50:56.172]  Don't forget the network website, GCNLive.com, and Gerald's site, FriendsResearch.com.
[02:50:56.172 --> 02:50:56.733]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.229 --> 02:51:04.611]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:51:04.611 --> 02:51:08.513]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:51:08.513 --> 02:51:12.235]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:51:12.235 --> 02:51:21.240]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[02:51:21.240 --> 02:51:22.381]  These filters are powerful.
[02:51:22.421 --> 02:51:22.981]  We're good to go.
[02:51:50.982 --> 02:51:53.708]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:51:53.708 --> 02:51:54.350]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[02:52:05.442 --> 02:52:06.703]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:06.703 --> 02:52:10.564]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.564 --> 02:52:12.865]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:12.865 --> 02:52:18.728]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:18.728 --> 02:52:24.951]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.391 --> 02:52:31.373]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:31.373 --> 02:52:35.534]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:35.534 --> 02:52:39.835]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:39.835 --> 02:52:45.777]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:45.777 --> 02:52:49.338]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.338 --> 02:52:51.319]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.319 --> 02:52:51.759]  It's here.

[02:53:00.868 --> 02:53:04.409]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:53:04.409 --> 02:53:06.690]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:53:06.690 --> 02:53:07.570]  Don't!
[02:53:07.570 --> 02:53:10.992]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:53:10.992 --> 02:53:20.095]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[02:53:20.095 --> 02:53:23.756]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:53:24.156 --> 02:53:26.899]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:53:26.899 --> 02:53:34.668]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:53:34.668 --> 02:53:35.869]  Herb K was right.
[02:53:35.869 --> 02:53:38.913]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:53:39.053 --> 02:53:40.313]  What do you have to lose?
[02:53:40.313 --> 02:53:41.534]  Stop the calls now.
[02:53:41.534 --> 02:53:43.494]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:53:43.494 --> 02:53:46.816]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.

[02:54:03.897 --> 02:54:05.758]  All right, final segment in this hour.
[02:54:05.758 --> 02:54:09.399]  We're making the search term Barry Sotaro today.
[02:54:09.399 --> 02:54:11.459]  S-O-E-T-O-R-O.
[02:54:11.459 --> 02:54:13.020]  People will find out his real name.
[02:54:13.020 --> 02:54:14.580]  He's an Indonesian citizen.
[02:54:14.580 --> 02:54:15.621]  Forget the Kenya stuff.
[02:54:15.621 --> 02:54:17.461]  This is documented.
[02:54:17.461 --> 02:54:21.663]  I want to just take a few final calls here with Gerald with quick comments or questions.
[02:54:21.663 --> 02:54:24.824]  Let's talk to John in Wyoming and Dan, Tony, and Tim.
[02:54:24.824 --> 02:54:25.684]  John, you're on the air.
[02:54:25.684 --> 02:54:27.244]  Go ahead.
[02:54:27.244 --> 02:54:28.905]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:54:28.905 --> 02:54:32.326]  I served in the submarine service during the Vietnam War, and I'm wondering
[02:54:32.833 --> 02:54:44.911]  Gerald, do you believe it was the North Koreans who torpedoed that South Korean patrol boat, or was it one of our submarines who did that in order to try to precipitate a major war with North Korea?
[02:54:45.871 --> 02:54:53.554]  One of the things that I've learned to do, and it's become very enjoyable for me, is I start watching Russian TV and China TV.
[02:54:53.554 --> 02:54:55.855]  You could get it on the cable channels.
[02:54:55.855 --> 02:55:06.359]  And I was listening to a Chinese expert who categorically denied that that was a torpedo from North Korea.
[02:55:06.359 --> 02:55:08.620]  And he went on with the evidence.
[02:55:08.620 --> 02:55:11.561]  There's nothing that they tell me that I would believe.
[02:55:11.561 --> 02:55:18.786]  Well the one they show looks like a German torpedo and there was a drill going on with the U.S., South Korea and Japan when it happened.
[02:55:18.786 --> 02:55:37.318]  That's part of it and the other one was that when it first happened, and this is very important as a trend tracker's tip, when the story breaks, jump on it right away and get all the global information you can because it was going on in South Korea, the people were very angry because that
[02:55:37.878 --> 02:55:38.638]  Very interesting.
[02:55:38.638 --> 02:55:39.838]  Anything else, John?
[02:55:39.838 --> 02:55:40.359]  No, sir.
[02:55:40.359 --> 02:55:44.159]  You guys have a great day and, of course, another great show as usual, Alex.
[02:55:44.159 --> 02:55:45.320]  Well, thank you so much, John.
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:46.540]  Dan in Canada.
[02:55:46.540 --> 02:55:47.720]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[02:56:03.106 --> 02:56:10.408]  Hey Gerald, uh, if The View was wise enough to invite you on, and they had the audacity to ask you about Lindsay Lohan, what would you say?
[02:56:11.295 --> 02:56:13.216]  I wouldn't go on that show.
[02:56:13.216 --> 02:56:20.900]  And I think it's a disgrace to the President of the United States to go on talk shows, laugh-ins, or anything else.
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:29.844]  I couldn't imagine a real Commander-in-Chief like Eisenhower go on these shows.
[02:56:29.844 --> 02:56:35.767]  And I've stopped going on a lot of them because they're too stupid for me.
[02:56:35.767 --> 02:56:37.208]  And they also taped you and then edited.
[02:56:38.294 --> 02:56:39.135]  That's the other one.
[02:56:39.135 --> 02:56:41.356]  I won't go on any tape shows.
[02:56:41.356 --> 02:56:42.917]  I'll only do live.
[02:56:42.917 --> 02:56:47.260]  Yeah, I just said no to the History Channel wanting me to do a big thing, and I said no.
[02:56:47.260 --> 02:56:48.301]  They couldn't believe I'd say no.
[02:56:48.301 --> 02:56:48.861]  I said no!
[02:56:48.861 --> 02:56:50.102]  Don't you want to be a big star?
[02:56:50.102 --> 02:56:50.922]  No, I don't!
[02:56:50.922 --> 02:56:52.203]  Have a nice day!
[02:56:52.203 --> 02:56:53.704]  Let's go ahead and jam in another one.
[02:56:53.704 --> 02:56:54.625]  Tony in Nebraska.
[02:56:54.625 --> 02:56:56.886]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilenti.
[02:56:56.886 --> 02:56:57.547]  This is Tony.
[02:56:57.547 --> 02:56:58.147]  I'm on.
[02:56:58.147 --> 02:56:59.648]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:59.648 --> 02:57:01.750]  Alex, good to talk to you.
[02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:02.890]  I just wanted to say I've
[02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:10.887]  Called the Congressman Fortenberry's office here for Nebraska at the Capitol.
[02:57:10.887 --> 02:57:11.948]  Raised a little cane.
[02:57:11.948 --> 02:57:20.818]  I didn't curse or anything about the Federal Reserve and the fact that Gaytner has stolen a trillion dollars from us and won't tell us where it's at.
[02:57:22.031 --> 02:57:25.854]  The very next day I got a call from the White House, or the U.S.
[02:57:25.854 --> 02:57:31.118]  Capitol, and at the same time I got something in the mail inviting me to a local meeting.
[02:57:31.118 --> 02:57:45.410]  My question for you two is, what is probably the hottest issue that I can bring up in this meeting, and it's a town hall meeting, that will open the eyes of my fellow citizens?
[02:57:45.410 --> 02:57:46.731]  We're almost out of time.
[02:57:46.731 --> 02:57:49.013]  We're out of time.
[02:57:49.013 --> 02:57:50.474]  Gerald, final word on this question.
[02:57:51.762 --> 02:57:54.443]  I would say no more bailouts for anybody.
[02:57:54.443 --> 02:57:56.384]  This is capitalism in America.
[02:57:56.384 --> 02:57:57.465]  Let's keep it like that.
[02:57:57.465 --> 02:57:59.186]  No more favoritism.
[02:57:59.186 --> 02:58:01.026]  I don't want my money going to anywhere.
[02:58:01.026 --> 02:58:03.788]  And number two, stop the wars.
[02:58:03.788 --> 02:58:06.749]  Bring our people home and reinvest that money
[02:58:07.250 --> 02:58:08.912]  It's trillions a year!
[02:58:08.912 --> 02:58:09.512]  I mean, imagine...
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:26.461]  It's incredible.

[02:58:36.096 --> 02:58:37.418]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:37.418 --> 02:58:38.099]  Great job.
