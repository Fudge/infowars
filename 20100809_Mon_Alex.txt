[01:13.400 --> 01:22.120]  for the next three hours and I want to go over the news first here today and

[01:31.760 --> 01:40.280]  one Barry Sotero aka Barack H Obama will be flying into Austin in the next few
[01:40.280 --> 01:45.000]  hours they've already got much of the highway shut down literally 200 yards
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.800]  or less from my office and there are just police all over the streets of
[01:50.800 --> 01:57.080]  Austin I guess to protect the Imperial Puppet and to give the illusion of the
[01:57.080 --> 02:02.080]  Imperial Puppet actually runs anything the truth is the Imperial Puppet has the
[02:02.080 --> 02:06.680]  lowest approval rating of any president in modern U.S. history and it's got a
[02:06.680 --> 02:12.160]  long way to go in its downward slide to infamy they built him up as the
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.040]  messianic leader who would fix all of our problems and of course he was there
[02:16.040 --> 02:20.640]  just to sucker the public and to stall them while world government was being
[02:20.640 --> 02:27.160]  established but we have a little little surprise for Barry Sotaro today here on
[02:27.160 --> 02:34.160]  the radio show and I'll announce that surprise at the start of the next hour
[02:34.160 --> 02:39.680]  and it'll be up at prisonplanet.com for everyone just to commemorate his
[02:39.680 --> 02:44.440]  visit to Austin Texas and I was listening to local news radio 590 this
[02:44.440 --> 02:48.880]  morning and there's gonna be a big demonstration down at UT he's gonna
[02:48.880 --> 02:55.320]  first speak at a $5,000 a plate luncheon at high noon at the four seasons on the
[02:55.320 --> 03:00.360]  river in downtown Austin on the Colorado River and then he will travel from
[03:00.360 --> 03:08.720]  there to UT's Gregory Jim at 2 p.m. today says causing street closures and
[03:08.720 --> 03:16.360]  traffic delays well into the afternoon of course Michelle is still enjoying her
[03:16.360 --> 03:21.920]  multi-million dollar taxpayer paid for a party and they're closing the beaches
[03:21.920 --> 03:25.800]  and the rest of the media says it's you know half a million bucks or so they're
[03:25.800 --> 03:29.800]  spending but if you they're not counting Air Force two and all the rest of the
[03:29.800 --> 03:33.760]  security but that in itself is a distraction the media is focusing on
[03:33.760 --> 03:38.440]  Michelle Obama the puppet first lady instead of the big bank stealing
[03:38.440 --> 03:43.320]  trillions they'll focus in on Obama who is their their front man and meant to
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.880]  take the fall for all their corruption just like the Republican puppet whether
[03:47.880 --> 03:53.120]  it's Mitt Romney or you know many of the other Republicans that they've got
[03:53.120 --> 03:56.920]  lined up like Sarah Palin even if they were good people which they're not
[03:56.920 --> 04:02.080]  they're not going to be able to really change anything as president and but
[04:02.080 --> 04:06.560]  still they will take the blame for it instead of the media focusing in on the
[04:06.560 --> 04:11.160]  where the real solution lies and that is at the state level through
[04:11.160 --> 04:15.240]  nullification taking our states back that remedy the founders gave us in the
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.800]  ninth and tenth amendment to block the unconstitutional criminal out of
[04:19.800 --> 04:25.480]  control usurpations of the federal government so that is coming up today
[04:25.480 --> 04:29.880]  we're gonna get a break here in a moment and let me come back I will get

[06:19.800 --> 06:23.840]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:23.840 --> 06:28.440]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:28.440 --> 06:32.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[08:13.400 --> 08:22.000]  it is Monday the ninth day of August 2010 Gerald Salante is coming up in about
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.960]  an hour and a half with us he'll join us for more than an hour and we'll have
[08:25.960 --> 08:31.240]  open phones always informative with his monthly visits I'm also going to spend
[08:31.240 --> 08:38.640]  about 20-30 minutes with a member of Army intelligence on the show because
[08:38.640 --> 08:44.240]  this person is specifically known to me and I had a chance to talk to him last
[08:44.240 --> 08:48.920]  week when we were doing some news reporting on what appears to be a
[08:48.920 --> 08:54.080]  FEMA camp going up at Fort Hood we we drove out there ourselves went on the
[08:54.080 --> 09:00.240]  base last Friday and confirmed that the barbed wire is facing in at the Fort
[09:00.240 --> 09:05.360]  Hood Sports Stadium they've they've put a fence up around it and a former park and
[09:05.360 --> 09:10.080]  has barbed wire facing in and the military people we've talked to not just
[09:10.080 --> 09:13.560]  this gentleman that will call Joseph he wanted to use his real name he says he's
[09:13.560 --> 09:19.520]  sick of it he wants to go public but he's known specifically by me and I told
[09:19.520 --> 09:25.160]  him no we're not using your real name I said we'll call you Joseph but he said
[09:25.160 --> 09:29.200]  that he's heard callers on the show when we've opened the phones up for military
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.040]  people to call specifically from Fort Hood that he knows and he was a formerly
[09:34.040 --> 09:38.880]  a police officer before he got in the Army and I'll just leave it at that but
[09:38.880 --> 09:43.480]  he was telling me some amazing stuff that we'd actually confirmed separately
[09:43.480 --> 09:49.760]  about the Joe Stack attack the airplane being flown into the IRS building about
[09:49.760 --> 09:58.160]  the Fort Hood shooter he was there for that that and what he told me came out
[09:58.160 --> 10:03.320]  partially in the news they were running a terror attack drill the day before and
[10:03.320 --> 10:08.320]  the day of that event and just the sense of the troops he was giving me that
[10:08.320 --> 10:11.840]  just all over the base troops listen to the show and I've confirmed that from
[10:11.840 --> 10:18.800]  other military sources unknown to me and also known to us that the radio show
[10:18.800 --> 10:24.760]  the films have been just on fire on military bases in the last five years
[10:24.760 --> 10:31.200]  so we'll get a report from him there's a lot he can't tell us obviously because
[10:31.200 --> 10:36.280]  of national security letters that he has signed especially dealing with things
[10:36.280 --> 10:40.520]  he's witnessed in Iraq and other countries but we'll talk about some
[10:40.520 --> 10:46.120]  very interesting things coming up in T-minus 50 minutes with the gentleman
[10:46.120 --> 10:51.600]  known as Joseph and then Gerald Salente will be joining us after that
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.840]  Barack Obama is coming to town he's about to land just about three miles from
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.840]  where I sit out at Berkshire International Airport they've got the highway
[11:00.840 --> 11:07.280]  already shut down by the office here for his lordship to be arriving here in
[11:07.280 --> 11:11.640]  town of course his real name is Barry Sataro and we've got a special little
[11:11.640 --> 11:18.760]  info war treat for the president that will launch here on the radio show I'll
[11:18.760 --> 11:23.240]  actually do that at the bottom of the hour coming up in 22 minutes when we
[11:23.240 --> 11:28.200]  come back from break the 33 after I'll launch this here on the air dealing with
[11:28.200 --> 11:38.720]  Barry Sataro aka Barack H Obama okay let me just read to you a few of the
[11:38.720 --> 11:47.160]  stacks we have here UN says Pakistan floods worse than 2004 tsunami massive
[11:47.160 --> 11:52.640]  deaths happening there affecting 13.8 million people who are in danger of
[11:52.640 --> 11:57.640]  being killed by the deluge also the reporting record hot temperatures in
[11:57.640 --> 12:03.120]  Moscow and serious wildfires there and the media saying see its global warming
[12:03.120 --> 12:09.160]  but meanwhile Florida State University reports that the 2010 global tropical
[12:09.160 --> 12:14.920]  cyclone activity is again at a record low so both typhoons in the east and
[12:14.920 --> 12:21.360]  hurricanes in the West they are very very weak this year and of course Russia
[12:21.360 --> 12:26.600]  declare state of emergency as at Ural's nuclear town where they produce a lot of
[12:26.600 --> 12:34.160]  their nuclear material for weapons and reactors that is all going on today but I
[12:34.160 --> 12:37.960]  just wanted to illustrate there are tens of thousands of different weather
[12:37.960 --> 12:43.160]  regions and sub regions in the United States and in Russia and in just
[12:43.160 --> 12:46.920]  worldwide there are tens of thousands of different regions depending on how you
[12:46.920 --> 12:52.680]  break it down and you can always point at certain regions and say look they're
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.240]  having unusual weather but if you look at the overall aggregate of weather systems
[12:57.240 --> 13:03.040]  the only thing that is normal is constant change that's why Lord Monkton and
[13:03.040 --> 13:06.400]  myself and many others always point out just because you're having record cold
[13:06.400 --> 13:10.880]  in many areas of the world at any one time that's completely normal because
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.880]  you're always having record highs and record colds depending on where you are
[13:15.880 --> 13:21.040]  on the planet but it's global averages that show that in the last 15 years the
[13:21.040 --> 13:26.040]  world has not been heating and the last 10 started a cooling trend but now
[13:26.040 --> 13:30.440]  because the Sun has flared back up and increased the amount of different forms
[13:30.440 --> 13:35.680]  of radiation and heat it's putting off your most scientist's degree you're
[13:35.680 --> 13:40.880]  going to now see the heating trend begin again but the United Nations last year
[13:40.880 --> 13:44.920]  at Copenhagen put out a declaration saying the Sun has no effect on our
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.800]  climate and that's like saying jumping off a thousand foot cliff with no
[13:50.800 --> 13:54.400]  parachute will have no effect on your legs when you hit the bottom and it
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.880]  kills you I mean it's just just amazingly ridiculous but every summer they
[14:00.880 --> 14:06.400]  hype global warming saying look how hot it is my gosh it's a hundred and six in
[14:06.400 --> 14:12.000]  Dallas well I remember it being a hundred and ten during two a days two
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.960]  separate summers in a row and they wouldn't cancel our two a days or
[14:15.960 --> 14:21.080]  shorten them and it's some nearby high schools a couple people died this is
[14:21.080 --> 14:27.160]  back in the late 1980s early 1990s and so they did then start suspending the
[14:27.160 --> 14:30.720]  two a days and the two football workouts a day I mean I remember that
[14:30.720 --> 14:36.680]  specifically and the UN has been caught manipulating weather charts manipulating
[14:36.680 --> 14:42.960]  buoy temperature readout data it's all on record that they've been caught doing
[14:42.960 --> 14:49.320]  this over and over and over again so I've covered that little miscellaneous
[14:49.320 --> 14:56.360]  piece of news let me now get into the economy then I'm going to get more into
[14:56.360 --> 15:00.560]  what's happening with the illegal aliens and the takeover of the United States
[15:00.560 --> 15:04.360]  into the North American Union how that ties in with a curtain memo story today
[15:04.360 --> 15:12.040]  Bella Melinda Gates Foundation gave millions to La Raza we've also seen a
[15:12.040 --> 15:17.440]  serious military escalation Reuters is reporting North Korea's fired artillery
[15:17.440 --> 15:22.480]  near its seaborder very close to ships and of course yesterday North Korea
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.920]  seized a South Korean fishing boat that was in a disputed territorial water
[15:27.920 --> 15:34.160]  area between North and South Korea and also in the military section of news
[15:34.160 --> 15:38.280]  we're seeing more cyber rattling by the United States and Israel threatening to
[15:38.280 --> 15:42.520]  attack Iran and Iran is saber rattling back I don't think that's a very good
[15:42.520 --> 15:46.800]  idea but they're doing it Iran vows to support Lebanon against Israeli
[15:46.800 --> 15:53.400]  aggression so they're definitely heating up on that front and Fidel Castro is
[15:53.400 --> 15:57.160]  warning that he's worried about nuclear conflagration so we'll be breaking that
[15:57.160 --> 16:04.760]  down but right now let's get into the economic news stack today this is from
[16:04.760 --> 16:11.320]  CNBC we have all of this linked up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[16:11.320 --> 16:17.000]  that's why I love the websites they started out 13 and a half years ago
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.760]  info wars.com did so I could post links to reports and legislation and
[16:21.760 --> 16:25.240]  documents so that people would have a place while listening to the live radio
[16:25.240 --> 16:30.760]  show to go check out the claims I was making and that's still the main reason
[16:30.760 --> 16:37.040]  we have info wars.com and prisonplanet.com though it's grown from there we
[16:37.040 --> 16:42.920]  are in the equivalent of a great depression strategist says the mid
[16:42.920 --> 16:47.600]  summer rally is over and stocks will begin to downward leg before bottoming
[16:47.600 --> 16:51.880]  in October as the world economy is in what looks like a great depression Robin
[16:51.880 --> 17:00.560]  Griffiths a technical strategist at Kaznova capital told CNBC this morning
[17:00.560 --> 17:03.480]  and this is what a lot of the other analysts are saying looking at the
[17:03.480 --> 17:08.360]  similar charts from the 1920s and early 1930s they say that it mirrors those
[17:08.360 --> 17:13.120]  charts and that's what Bob Chapman Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Gerald Salente
[17:13.120 --> 17:16.680]  Webster Tarpley and many other economists and experts we've had on have
[17:16.680 --> 17:22.160]  concurred with equities are for losers and bond markets for winners equities are
[17:22.160 --> 17:26.200]  simply for people who like losing money you want to say double dip is
[17:26.200 --> 17:31.480]  inevitable and imminent as Keynesian stimulus measures have never worked
[17:31.480 --> 17:35.400]  anywhere we are in the equivalent of a great depression following three years
[17:35.400 --> 17:40.000]  of credit crisis he added but there will be some winners and relative over
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.960]  performers in the stock market yeah the Federal Reserve insiders firms like
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.640]  Caterpillar will do well America has some great companies and cat is one of
[17:48.640 --> 17:52.800]  them I also like the German market you know they've blocked the pension fund
[17:52.800 --> 17:56.920]  rating and they've also blocked the brokerage firms coming in and rating the
[17:56.920 --> 18:01.520]  euro exports are doing well and will be further boosted by performance of the
[18:01.520 --> 18:07.000]  euro over the last 12 months German exports rose by a higher than expected
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.120]  3.8 percent in June that's because their government protects their domestic
[18:11.120 --> 18:17.040]  production their manufacturing system in June following strong demand from
[18:17.040 --> 18:22.520]  across the world for German goods according to data released Monday I
[18:22.520 --> 18:29.120]  agree with that analysis here's another one from CNBC dollar will weaken three
[18:29.120 --> 18:34.840]  sectors will rule strategists say and they've got the job report it's worse
[18:34.840 --> 18:40.760]  than what they even put out last week and they went on to say that they should
[18:40.760 --> 18:46.960]  look to technology and energy and industrial sectors continuing Wall
[18:46.960 --> 18:53.240]  Street rewards to trigger surge in informants and it reports how the
[18:53.240 --> 18:59.080]  stimulus bill can pay up to million dollar cash rewards to people that rat
[18:59.080 --> 19:05.080]  out their bosses for financial impropriety but this will all be
[19:05.080 --> 19:09.200]  selectively enforced I mean the Securities and Exchange Commission is
[19:09.200 --> 19:12.840]  Fox News and AP reported in the last two weeks as we reported in the last three
[19:12.840 --> 19:18.200]  months on the legislation with Ron Paul and others breaking it down here on air
[19:18.200 --> 19:23.640]  the Securities and Exchange Commission when insiders expose Madoff or Goldman
[19:23.640 --> 19:31.480]  Sachs or JP Morgan or AIG engaged in out and out criminal activity for decades
[19:31.480 --> 19:39.160]  the SEC covers it up and it goes on new US whistleblowing incentives within the
[19:39.160 --> 19:44.080]  Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act that could net informants multi-million dollar
[19:44.080 --> 19:47.880]  payouts are likely to generate a surge in allegations against US listed
[19:47.880 --> 19:52.160]  companies and Wall Street banks yeah the globalist are gonna have whistleblower
[19:52.160 --> 19:57.000]  give them intel and then selectively go after their competition to
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.840]  consolidate things further we'll be right back you worry but only because you're
[20:01.840 --> 20:05.440]  paying attention what's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity

[24:20.480 --> 24:26.280]  of the financial overhaul got language written in where they cannot be
[24:26.280 --> 24:31.120]  reviewed and they can operate secretly a private Federal Reserve board is being
[24:31.120 --> 24:36.000]  given full control over every facet of the economy to steal more the very
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  culprits of the massacre in the chicken coop the weasels and the foxes are now
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.160]  being hired to run guard duty on the chicken coop but they're going to sick
[24:48.160 --> 24:52.440]  the general population on other financial institutions insurance
[24:52.440 --> 24:57.120]  companies businesses where the government can then selectively cherry pick
[24:57.120 --> 25:01.640]  who they want to go after this is similar to the famous cases that are
[25:01.640 --> 25:08.160]  legion in drug cases where they have in some cases famous informants who
[25:08.160 --> 25:14.080]  testify in hundreds of drug trials and IRS trials where they just walk in and
[25:14.080 --> 25:21.880]  lie and the police and the prosecutors know they're lying they don't care and
[25:21.880 --> 25:25.800]  so this is part of the new financial terrorism against the general
[25:25.800 --> 25:30.400]  population and the article goes on the Securities and Exchange Commission is
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.200]  expecting a sharp increase in tip-offs from senior employees and third parties
[25:35.200 --> 25:40.560]  prompted by potential seven-figure bounties the scale of the awards reflects
[25:40.560 --> 25:45.560]  the high-quality whistleblowers we hope for people within a company broker or
[25:45.560 --> 25:51.000]  other related firm that we might not have heard from Steven Cohen said and
[25:51.000 --> 25:57.880]  including different accounting firms and law firms that you hire for taxes and
[25:57.880 --> 26:02.760]  CPAs isn't that just special four years ago they changed the federal rules not
[26:02.760 --> 26:10.320]  the law but the rules where CPAs are libel for the tax returns they
[26:10.320 --> 26:15.200]  file for you and so they won't even give you the supposed tax write offs that
[26:15.200 --> 26:20.160]  are in law and now they're just going to be completely on the payroll of the
[26:20.160 --> 26:23.560]  government that reminds me of the 60-minute piece I saw more than a
[26:23.560 --> 26:26.840]  decade ago and since then it's got more attention remember the famous case of a
[26:26.840 --> 26:31.480]  guy flying from Virginia to Houston he done it many times he would pay cash
[26:31.480 --> 26:36.920]  because he got a discount for the trees that would be hauled from Texas via 18
[26:36.920 --> 26:43.000]  Wheeler to Virginia and he pulled out his wallet with a bank bag with tens of
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.760]  thousands of dollars and paid for his ticket with it and the lady it turned
[26:46.760 --> 26:51.480]  out was making more money a year as a ticket teller tattling on people then
[26:51.480 --> 27:01.000]  she was making working as a teller or a airline ticket issuer she's making over
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.720]  a hundred thousand dollars a year on that and they said look it doesn't matter
[27:04.720 --> 27:08.560]  if it's his money it doesn't matter if tax records show he paid taxes on the
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.920]  trees it doesn't matter you're not allowed to carry cash and we're taking it
[27:11.920 --> 27:16.320]  that's just like the reports you see constantly usually in Texas for some
[27:16.320 --> 27:20.280]  reason of small-town cops they pull over an old lady she opens her purse up to
[27:20.280 --> 27:23.920]  give him a license they see 5,000 in cash and they say that could be drug
[27:23.920 --> 27:30.640]  money no judge no jury my money mine mine this is the corrupt system so
[27:30.640 --> 27:35.640]  spent too much time on that but it's an interesting area to discuss meanwhile
[27:35.640 --> 27:43.120]  CNBC reports Tyson's profits surge beef and pork improve and of course they
[27:43.120 --> 27:47.720]  have a oligopoly here in the United States and it's come out in major news
[27:47.720 --> 27:53.440]  reports including USA Today that they can have in some cases hundreds of times
[27:53.440 --> 27:58.960]  the violations in their plants than other companies but they're allowed to do
[27:58.960 --> 28:04.560]  it and nobody else is just like BP had many many times in Houston alone in
[28:04.560 --> 28:08.720]  Texas City violations at their refineries come more than all of the
[28:08.720 --> 28:14.320]  refineries combined that's okay they get safety awards from Bush and Barack
[28:14.320 --> 28:21.440]  Hussein Obama that's a k.a. of course Barack Hussein Obama Barry Setaro so
[28:21.440 --> 28:25.720]  all part of the monopoly the monopoly men like Carlos Slim controlling the
[28:25.720 --> 28:29.480]  cell phone market he just makes billions every year in Mexico because he
[28:29.480 --> 28:35.080]  has a quasi monopoly down there that's where the big profits are made is the
[28:35.080 --> 28:41.240]  founder of the Rockefeller dynasty said competition is a sin continuing the
[28:41.240 --> 28:44.560]  United States looking more and more like a third world country dealing with the
[28:44.560 --> 28:49.520]  economy you don't have reliable energy they want to put massive taxes on coal
[28:49.520 --> 28:53.920]  that supplies 51% of our electricity and we build just what two or three new
[28:53.920 --> 28:59.400]  power plants a year China's building two or three a week but under the new
[28:59.400 --> 29:04.800]  carbon taxes they wouldn't new plants would not even be allowed US electricity
[29:04.800 --> 29:09.520]  blackout skyrocketing singing in reports New York Staten Island was broiling
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.840]  under life-threatening heat wave that brought President James Molinaro was
[29:14.840 --> 29:19.640]  seriously concerned about the area's little league baseball players and it
[29:19.640 --> 29:24.360]  just goes on to mention that they're having massive power outages that are
[29:24.360 --> 29:30.240]  intensifying in the last few years across the United States we'll come back
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.360]  with more financial news and military news then I want to get into the

[36:08.000 --> 36:15.840]  Barry Sotaro aka Barack Obama's political dynasty crashes and burns that's not
[36:15.840 --> 36:21.760]  the big announcement we saw the media building him up in 2008 elections as
[36:21.760 --> 36:28.160]  God as Christ and many media outlets said it was like he's Jesus that he was
[36:28.160 --> 36:33.320]  Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King and George Washington rolled into one he
[36:33.320 --> 36:37.160]  was going to give you free health care free cars free homes everything was
[36:37.160 --> 36:41.200]  going to be milk and honey he was going to end the wars he was going to stop the
[36:41.200 --> 36:44.640]  torture he was going to stop the secret arrest he was going to free the
[36:44.640 --> 36:49.680]  internet he has taken everything Bush was doing and basically it was like
[36:49.680 --> 36:56.080]  adding nitrous oxide to a race car he's only turbo supercharged it and so if we
[36:56.080 --> 36:59.560]  were going 200 miles an hour towards the New World Order over a cliff we're going
[36:59.560 --> 37:05.120]  300 miles an hour total integration the baton was handed off flawlessly from
[37:05.120 --> 37:13.200]  George W. the puppet to Barack H. Obama true name Barry Sotaro now here's the
[37:13.200 --> 37:19.520]  big announcement we've done this eight times and every time it's been the
[37:19.520 --> 37:23.320]  number one search in the last three weeks for a few times a week and I got a
[37:23.320 --> 37:28.360]  lot of emails saying why don't you make the key search term Barry Sotaro that
[37:28.360 --> 37:33.640]  was listener recommended by a lot of people on and off air and great minds
[37:33.640 --> 37:37.840]  think alike I think that's a wonderful idea but you can't just make it the key
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.840]  search term without having an article that becomes the number one link that
[37:42.840 --> 37:46.720]  hundreds of thousands if not millions of people will then link to and in some
[37:46.720 --> 37:50.680]  cases hundreds of newspapers and blogs report on the top search terms that we've
[37:50.680 --> 37:57.000]  promoted but always it's at least 30 40 50 or so and causes a big buzz this
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.560]  won't save the world what we're about to do but the act of resistance will go a
[38:01.560 --> 38:05.560]  long way towards it it's one more step on this thousand mile journey and we're
[38:05.560 --> 38:09.160]  more than halfway there defeating the globalist if we just continue with
[38:09.160 --> 38:14.480]  perseverance to march towards Mount Doom and throw the ring of doom into the
[38:14.480 --> 38:20.720]  fires from which it was made and by politically destroying and unmasking and
[38:20.720 --> 38:27.720]  revealing the fraud that is Obama people were awake to Bush now they've awoken to
[38:27.720 --> 38:31.560]  Obama and instead of just now the Republicans are in favor the Democrats
[38:31.560 --> 38:38.800]  are out of favor they always tag team us back and forth now because of the fact
[38:38.800 --> 38:42.520]  that people are getting wise to the false left-right paradigm you have both
[38:42.520 --> 38:45.880]  political parties with record low approval ratings you don't just have
[38:45.880 --> 38:49.560]  incumbent Democrats and all the major primaries losing you have incumbent
[38:49.560 --> 38:54.120]  Republicans or candidates that are seen as establishment losing that's why the
[38:54.120 --> 38:59.520]  Democrats are now running TV ads nationwide a whole gaggle of them saying
[38:59.520 --> 39:03.680]  that Republicans are establishment as well which is actually smart you know I
[39:03.680 --> 39:09.160]  told Politico a few months ago I said you know if you attack Rand Paul as an
[39:09.160 --> 39:12.680]  out-of-touch right-wing patriot you're gonna help him but I said if you
[39:12.680 --> 39:17.680]  attack him as establishment that's the only success you're gonna have I said
[39:17.680 --> 39:22.520]  when you attack him it's an endorsement of him and so they're actually starting
[39:22.520 --> 39:26.600]  to figure that out but but but people are becoming very sophisticated and
[39:26.600 --> 39:33.440]  understanding what's happening and so to commemorate Barry Cetero aka
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.680]  Barack H. Obama coming to Austin Texas and shutting down the highways and his
[39:37.680 --> 39:41.880]  wife on her multi-million it's not a half million it's multi-million if you
[39:41.880 --> 39:46.120]  count all the Secret Service and Air Force two and the rest of it and
[39:46.120 --> 39:49.840]  shutting down the beaches and the rest of it it's in the millions to commemorate
[39:49.840 --> 39:54.160]  Marie Antoinette and their corruption to commemorate the fact that we see
[39:54.160 --> 39:59.320]  through his puppetry and that we've already politically destroyed him now
[39:59.320 --> 40:03.400]  we've got to educate people to the next level of understanding that established
[40:03.400 --> 40:10.400]  republicans like Mitt Romney and General Petraeus are not the answer as well the
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.240]  answer is Ron Paul 2012 the answer is nullification at the state level if we
[40:15.240 --> 40:18.480]  spent the same amount of energy we spend on presidential elections that are
[40:18.480 --> 40:21.680]  rigged to a certain extent by the billions that are given to the candidates
[40:21.680 --> 40:25.840]  by the mega corporations if we spent the time and energy on the states which
[40:25.840 --> 40:29.320]  we're starting to do we can take them back under the remedy the founders gave
[40:29.320 --> 40:33.280]  us the 9th and 10th amendment and neutralize these people big time and they
[40:33.280 --> 40:39.880]  realize that that's why they're trying to block the states rights movement but
[40:39.880 --> 40:47.760]  I want to put back on screen for people the article Barry Sotero aka Barack
[40:47.760 --> 40:52.640]  Obama's political dynasty crashes and burns I need you to get this article
[40:52.640 --> 40:58.560]  from prisonplanet.com and info wars.com and I need you to post it on your blog
[40:58.560 --> 41:03.480]  your Facebook you're my space I need you to make YouTube videos about it I need
[41:03.480 --> 41:13.320]  you to type the the name Barry Sotero B-A-R-R-Y-S-O-E-T-O-R-O into search
[41:13.320 --> 41:18.360]  engines but not just Google let's do Yahoo let's do some of the others let's
[41:18.360 --> 41:24.240]  make it number one the biggest push we've ever done and you know I want to do
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.680]  this sparingly but but time is short even ABC is announcing that there's a
[41:28.680 --> 41:33.660]  deal between Google and Verizon that begins to end net neutrality and freedom
[41:33.660 --> 41:36.640]  on the web as we know it meaning they're going to start restricting what
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.640]  sites you can visit or making companies pay more to have their sites be
[41:40.640 --> 41:46.040]  accessible or to load quickly the federal government as you know the FCC and
[41:46.040 --> 41:49.480]  others the federal trade commission as well are moving to start censoring the
[41:49.480 --> 41:53.520]  web they're openly pushing how this is important to do with their cyber
[41:53.520 --> 41:57.960]  security act and and internet too and all of it so we need to use the web while
[41:57.960 --> 42:02.400]  we've got it and so I'm taking your recommendations as listeners to make
[42:02.400 --> 42:07.320]  Barry Sotero the number one search term but it's up to you now and I commend you
[42:07.320 --> 42:11.760]  I salute you I thank you for the great jobs you've done this is your mission if
[42:11.760 --> 42:22.200]  you choose to accept it Barry Sotero you spell Sotero S-O-E-T-O-R-O S-O-E-T-O-R-O
[42:22.200 --> 42:27.680]  Barry Sotero or Sotaro depending on how you want to pronounce it Barry Sotaro
[42:27.680 --> 42:33.400]  that's his Indonesian name when he gave up his US citizenship this is admitted
[42:33.400 --> 42:37.600]  you know you can debate the Kenyan situation though it looks extremely
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.280]  suspicious but we know he had to give up his US citizenship to become an
[42:42.280 --> 42:46.920]  Indonesian citizen and take on the the his his name this is in his college
[42:46.920 --> 42:51.200]  records the records we do have the media has reported it like it's no big deal
[42:51.200 --> 42:55.160]  we've got links to mainstream news admitting his real name is Barry Sotero
[42:55.160 --> 43:00.320]  and if we can expose that this guy's a fraud and not eligible to be president
[43:00.320 --> 43:10.880]  everything he's done is made no and void so Barry Sotaro Barry Sotaro S-O-E-T-O-R-O
[43:10.880 --> 43:19.640]  Barry Sotaro is the search term for August 9th Monday August 9th 2010 and the
[43:19.640 --> 43:25.120]  number one link on news and web will be our article if you click on it and
[43:25.120 --> 43:28.840]  send it out to everyone you know so we need this to be the top link that means
[43:28.840 --> 43:31.080]  send the link out to everybody because whatever gets the most traffic goes to
[43:31.080 --> 43:34.960]  the top and we need you to make of the number one search term Barry Sotaro
[43:34.960 --> 43:41.480]  this will be another devastating salvo of truth against the globalist lies
[43:41.480 --> 43:46.240]  because people are really starting to find out there was a CBS News poll last
[43:46.240 --> 43:49.440]  week there was another big poll in fact I forget the other poll you guys search
[43:49.440 --> 43:55.480]  six out of ten Americans questioned a president's birth or origin of his birth
[43:55.480 --> 43:59.360]  because I want that other I saw the CBS but I don't I don't remember the other
[43:59.360 --> 44:04.840]  one one showed a even six out of ten in several thousand questioned the other
[44:04.840 --> 44:09.480]  poll it was more it was almost seven out of ten there was a fraction below that
[44:09.480 --> 44:13.840]  and I don't remember the exact number I still was above six out of ten six out
[44:13.840 --> 44:21.000]  of ten no he's an illegitimate fraud he was an Indonesian citizen his name is
[44:21.000 --> 44:26.680]  Barry Sotaro Sotaro so Barry Sotaro Barry Sotaro two words that's the search
[44:26.680 --> 44:31.080]  term today Barry Sotaro and the establishment cannot stand this I'll
[44:31.080 --> 44:35.560]  tell you and this will be a very effective term conservatively hundreds of
[44:35.560 --> 44:41.400]  thousands probably millions of people will now search the term they'll see it
[44:41.400 --> 44:44.880]  is the top term a bunch of newspapers and blogs will write about it because it's
[44:44.880 --> 44:49.040]  the top term and people will find out a whole new crop of people will find out
[44:49.040 --> 44:53.000]  and next time there's a poll that may be eight out of ten and we'll do it again
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.320]  then it'll be nine out of ten until everyone knows we have an Indonesian
[44:57.320 --> 45:04.360]  citizen whose true name is Barry Sotaro as the president of the United States in
[45:04.360 --> 45:09.840]  fact call Watson have him post those last videos that are on the Alex Jones
[45:09.840 --> 45:14.840]  channel that were grabbed from prison planet TV with Phil Berg what a week ago
[45:14.840 --> 45:20.680]  or so when he was on let's add those videos into the article as well CNN says
[45:20.680 --> 45:27.320]  bad news for Obama six out of ten doubt US birth story poll numbers for those
[45:27.320 --> 45:34.040]  questioning eligibility status continue to rise the poll was taken July 16th the
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.720]  21st out of 1,018 adults including 335 Democrats 285 Republicans it has a
[45:39.720 --> 45:43.080]  margin of error of 3% so they overpulled Democrats trying to skew it
[45:43.080 --> 45:46.960]  still didn't work the question was do you think Barack Obama was definitively
[45:46.960 --> 45:50.280]  born in the United States probably born in the United States probably born in
[45:50.280 --> 45:54.400]  other country or definitely born in other country definitely in the United
[45:54.400 --> 46:01.720]  States got 42% but of the other 60 plus percent they questioned where he was
[46:01.720 --> 46:05.800]  really born but I think that's reporting on the CBS poll there's another one too
[46:05.800 --> 46:12.700]  but regardless there it is for you good job guys finding that article so they
[46:12.700 --> 46:16.280]  can sit there and tell us we're cooks and nobody's listening to you and you
[46:16.280 --> 46:19.960]  can't beat us and we can put umpty-dumpty back together again no you
[46:19.960 --> 46:24.880]  can't so Barry Sataro go back to Indonesia you gave up your citizenship
[46:24.880 --> 46:30.400]  you're landing in my town Austin Texas here's my little gift to you for myself
[46:30.400 --> 46:34.800]  and my audience number one Google search term I got a sneak and suspicion
[46:34.800 --> 46:38.640]  unless Google's got a block on this term that it's gonna be numero uno and
[46:38.640 --> 46:43.640]  we're gonna be nine for nine victorious with our article Barry Sataro aka
[46:43.640 --> 46:50.000]  Barack Obama's political dynasty crashes and burns not only will they find out
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.560]  his real names Barry Sataro and he's from Indonesia and gave up a
[46:52.560 --> 46:56.920]  citizenship they'll find out about his globalist aims this is a great article
[46:56.920 --> 47:02.160]  Paul Watson threw together I called him in about 10 30 with this idea so about
[47:02.160 --> 47:06.240]  an hour ago and I said please get us a report by halfway in the first hour and
[47:06.240 --> 47:10.680]  he got it up in time and it's an excellent article Barry Sataro aka
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.400]  Barack Obama's political dynasty crashes and burns will Obama be forced to rely
[47:15.400 --> 47:20.960]  on the engineered pre-election surprise to rescue his presidency one
[47:20.960 --> 47:24.880]  surprise is he's saying he may forgive part of people's mortgages which they
[47:24.880 --> 47:29.280]  claimed the first banker bailout was for so watch that that'll be a bait and
[47:29.280 --> 47:32.640]  switch they'll probably pass that but then after the election withhold almost
[47:32.640 --> 47:36.720]  all of it I mean that's that that's been their modus operandi that's been their
[47:36.720 --> 47:42.400]  attack pattern while Barry Sataro lavishes himself at a luxury Spanish
[47:42.400 --> 47:47.640]  resort amidst deepening economic turmoil back home his political dynasty
[47:47.640 --> 47:53.320]  crashes and burns as his approval ratings plunged to record low of 41% with
[47:53.320 --> 47:59.200]  less than a few months to go before the October midterm elections I'm actually
[47:59.200 --> 48:03.880]  gonna go to prisonplanet.com and pull this up and read it from the
[48:03.880 --> 48:12.000]  telescreen itself against the third story down in the featured news section
[48:12.000 --> 48:24.200]  keyword search today Barry Sataro SOE T ORO you got to love good old Barack
[48:24.200 --> 48:30.880]  Obama Obama has come under widespread criticism for preaching austerity and
[48:30.880 --> 48:35.640]  financial discipline while shunning himself at the opulent resort in
[48:35.640 --> 48:39.680]  coast to the sole region as his wife Michelle parades around an expensive
[48:39.680 --> 48:43.600]  designer clothing as the country worsens and top financial experts openly
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.000]  talk of Americans entering a second-rate depression Obama's approval
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.760]  ratings continue to head south in a hurry as we expose in the Obama deception
[48:51.760 --> 48:58.400]  the manufactured populist euphoria behind the crowning of Sataro was always
[48:58.400 --> 49:02.400]  likely to rapidly deflate once it became apparent that Obama was the ultimate
[49:02.400 --> 49:07.080]  puppet a vacuous servant of the bankers and the elite to whom he owes his
[49:07.080 --> 49:12.960]  entire political dynasty just 41% approve of the way Obama is handling his job in
[49:12.960 --> 49:17.560]  the United States a Gallup poll shows the lowest figure since Sataro took
[49:17.560 --> 49:22.280]  office in 2009 for someone whose political career is obviously sinking out
[49:22.280 --> 49:27.200]  of sight Obama seems remarkably relaxed about it at ominous portend that the
[49:27.200 --> 49:32.280]  people who pull the strings have lined up a helpful pre-election surprise as a
[49:32.280 --> 49:37.040]  means of rallying the American people back around their fallen commander and
[49:37.040 --> 49:44.000]  chief on one side of the scale some are speculating and Obama could announce a
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.720]  gigantic bailout of Main Street in the form of debt relief for millions of
[49:47.720 --> 49:53.200]  Americans whose homes are now worth more than their mortgages this promised
[49:53.200 --> 49:57.280]  giveaway would likely invigorate support for Obama from millions of
[49:57.280 --> 50:01.200]  gullible idiots who voted for him in the first place while proclaiming that all
[50:01.200 --> 50:05.280]  their problems would be solved by the Christ-like Obama who would pay their
[50:05.280 --> 50:09.480]  mortgage and their gas bills we have links to the videos of those gullible
[50:09.480 --> 50:25.480]  zombies Obama zombies saying that of course the rhetoric behind any such
[50:25.480 --> 50:29.080]  giveaway would be fantastic enough to buy votes in the short term but the
[50:29.080 --> 50:32.560]  reality budget to program would soon disintegrate into the aftermath of the
[50:32.560 --> 50:37.040]  midterms however on the extreme end of the scale summer warning of or even
[50:37.040 --> 50:40.840]  advocating that Obama will launch an attack on Iran and resetting off World
[50:40.840 --> 50:45.120]  War three is a ploy through which to keep himself in power just as the 911
[50:45.120 --> 50:48.800]  attack saw Bush's approval ratings soar into the 90s rallying Americans around
[50:48.800 --> 50:52.240]  an external threat could be just the ticket for administration is completely
[50:52.240 --> 50:56.440]  polarized the country and whose actions have led to the creation of a fierce
[50:56.440 --> 51:02.080]  political opposition groups like the Tea Party we all know that the Berkey
[51:02.080 --> 51:05.840]  water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration as an
[51:05.840 --> 51:08.800]  authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of

[53:06.600 --> 53:10.360]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[53:10.360 --> 53:14.040]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[53:14.040 --> 53:17.320]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[53:17.320 --> 53:21.400]  again so our friends and solutions from science have put together the perfect
[53:21.400 --> 53:26.800]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[53:26.800 --> 53:31.040]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best

[53:55.280 --> 54:01.520]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:01.520 --> 54:16.360]  we've even had people like Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times of London say
[54:16.360 --> 54:21.520]  that Obama needs an Oklahoma City or 9-11 event so he can look strong for
[54:21.520 --> 54:25.840]  people so when folks read this article with Barry Sataro being the top search
[54:25.840 --> 54:32.240]  term today they will learn about all of this it continues however on the extreme
[54:32.240 --> 54:36.080]  end of the scale summer warning or even advocating that Obama will launch an
[54:36.080 --> 54:40.800]  attack on Iran and risk setting off World War three as a ploy through which to
[54:40.800 --> 54:44.760]  keep himself in power just as the 9-11 attack saw Bush's approval rating soar
[54:44.760 --> 54:49.440]  into the 90s rallying Americans around an external threat could be just the
[54:49.440 --> 54:53.280]  ticket for an administration that has completely polarized the country and in
[54:53.280 --> 54:57.200]  whose actions have led to the creation of a fierce political opposition groups
[54:57.200 --> 55:02.000]  like the Tea Party yeah but maybe 20 30% max support him it's not even
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.840]  polarization as unifying the country against the corrupt government
[55:05.840 --> 55:11.480]  Obama and this whole theater that we've seen this fiasco has helped take the
[55:11.480 --> 55:15.680]  blinders off our eyes there can be little doubt that unless an
[55:15.680 --> 55:19.840]  artificially engineered surprise event helps Obama turn things around the
[55:19.840 --> 55:24.280]  losses for the Democrats will be drastic as Bruce Drake points out today the
[55:24.280 --> 55:27.240]  party that controls the White House usually loses house seats in the
[55:27.240 --> 55:31.520]  off-year contest and the losses are bigger when the president's job approval
[55:31.520 --> 55:35.400]  rating is below 50% in 1994 when President Bill Clinton's approval
[55:35.400 --> 55:40.360]  rating stood at 46% Republicans picked up 53 seats to recapture the house after
[55:40.360 --> 55:43.760]  it had been in the Democratic hands for most of the previous 40 years the next
[55:43.760 --> 55:48.280]  three months will provide a clear answer as to whether Barry Sataro's
[55:48.280 --> 55:54.440]  teleprompter reading days are over or if there is to be a dramatic sting in the
[55:54.440 --> 55:58.840]  tale that will preserve Obama's political capital for just long enough to
[55:58.840 --> 56:03.160]  give him a shot at staying in the White House for another term and completing
[56:03.160 --> 56:09.480]  his conversion of the United States into the world government and so the
[56:09.480 --> 56:14.800]  article is Barry Sataro aka Barack Obama's political dynasty crashes and
[56:14.800 --> 56:20.440]  burns a great boil down we hope thanks for your help to make the number one
[56:20.440 --> 56:26.320]  search term Barry Sataro today so that hundreds of thousands bare minimum
[56:26.320 --> 56:30.320]  probably millions will read this article and find out the truth and I'm gonna
[56:30.320 --> 56:34.120]  have Watson also add our interviews with Phil Berg the attorney the father of the
[56:34.120 --> 56:38.520]  birth room movement in this article as well for folks that don't like to read
[56:38.520 --> 56:42.800]  we'll post those videos in the middle of the article for some of the internet
[56:42.800 --> 56:48.360]  audience out there that just wants to see it via the spoken word so very
[56:48.360 --> 56:52.440]  exciting and to be able to fight back and strike back against the propaganda
[56:52.440 --> 56:59.440]  of Barry Sataro aka Barack Obama I can hear on top of the studio on the roof
[56:59.440 --> 57:05.000]  Rob do just climbed up there to get a video shot of the motorcade as it rolls

[57:24.800 --> 57:29.840]  meeting in Virginia we knew where he'd be as the heir apparent to George W. Bush
[57:29.840 --> 57:33.000]  and Secret Service drove by with the little submachine guns and pointed it
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.520]  at us how dare the American people go and expose a treasonous treacherous

[59:05.960 --> 59:10.320]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.320 --> 59:14.400]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:14.400 --> 59:18.960]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:18.960 --> 59:23.080]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.880]  big banks and big money powers funding it well they want to be able to have a

[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.400]  this gentleman through some people I work with in business I know he's in the
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.760]  army I know he works in intelligence I'll just leave it at that he was
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.400]  formerly a police officer before he joined the military and he can tell you
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:02.360]  some stories about Katrina about the Fort Hood shooting about police he works
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:08.440]  with in Austin we're not gonna say how but what they saw and what these
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.480]  firefighters he knows saw and actually part of this came out in the mainstream
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.280]  news dealing with the Joe Stack kamikaze attack on the IRS building in
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:21.920]  Austin a few months ago but we first got contacted by him dealing with the
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.000]  sports stadium at Fort Hood they're tearing it down but around it and the
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.200]  park putting up a bar bar fence with bar bar facing in and I sent Rob do and
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.880]  Aaron Dykes out there this weekend are actually Friday to observe this and it
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.120]  was true so I thought I would just get him on to talk about a few of these
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.920]  issues and also the exciting news he's given us that many other people I know
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:48.240]  in the military are also concurring with that there is a huge awakening in the
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:55.600]  military especially with non-commissioned officers and officers and let's just say
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.800]  the more intelligent arm of the military I'm not saying the grunts aren't
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:04.760]  patriots and waking up to but the smart guys you know the brain bugs to use a
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:10.680]  Starship troopers analogy they can see what's going on and so joining us is
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.040]  Joseph Joseph thank you for coming on with us well thanks for having me Alex

[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.520]  minute but I threw out a lot of issues but I mean why are you wanting to come
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.840]  on the show why did you want to use your your whole name I mean yeah you've got
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:30.720]  to be really focused to do that well Alex in today's world I don't see a whole
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.720]  lot of accountability and bravery and we in the public service aspect of the
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.000]  government we have to start standing up to what is right or to what is wrong and
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.600]  doing what is right and I see more and more of that every day you know my time
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.360]  is pleased off striped off corruption to just it almost destroyed my soul Alex
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:55.080]  it shook me to my very core and that's the reason I left and I went into the
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.280]  military speaking larger accountability thinking things would be better and they
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.080]  happen for the most part and the people I've met here in Austin the police that
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.800]  I know the firefighters that I know they're all great people I haven't met
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.040]  the same kind of people that I knew on the Gulf Coast and you know obviously
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.440]  anything I'm gonna stay here about the military today is not gonna be direct
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.280]  opinion of the Department of Defense I just wanted to say that right now so you
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.240]  know as long as we're clear the Department of Defense can't really hold
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:31.200]  anything against me and we're not gonna get anything classified in fact almost
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:38.760]  almost everything I think I need to take this is Jesse Ventura but it's always
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.960]  like Charlie Sheen calling when I'm around I forgot to turn my ringer off

[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:51.280]  call me during the break but we'll see if I'm able to talk about some of this
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:55.600]  later in the week some of the things developing on that front but we're
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.600]  joined in this segment the next and then Gerald Salente the top trans forecaster
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.080]  is going to be on with us for a full hour and a half coming up at the bottom
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.560]  of the hour we're talking to Joseph who was a police officer and got this
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:13.040]  disillusioned by what he saw in Katrina then he joined the military and I know
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.560]  who he is I mean we we work with and our friends with some folks that are very
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.200]  close friends with him and we have a lot of other military sources but this is a
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.360]  source that we can directly confirm he gave us some information about fences
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.800]  being put in that face in on the base at Fort Hood we went out there in the
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.600]  public area of the base and there it is we're watching that so much to talk
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.480]  about with him in the time we've got let's start with what you saw on the
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:40.120]  Gulf Coast during Katrina and then what you've seen when you're in the military
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:45.400]  dealing with the shooting at Fort Hood dealing with the intel you got from the
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:51.360]  fire department others about Joe Stack okay I'll start with the office stories
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.840]  nearest nearest a lot of people there where you're located I'm personal
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.280]  friends with a lot of people down in the Austin fire department and when we
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:06.120]  were at a unofficial function we were talking my wife and his wife and a
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:11.200]  gentleman and he had mentioned that all the police or the fire chief were in a
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:15.200]  meeting at the time of the attack and I don't know whether he said steamer or
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.080]  not but obviously you can speculate on your own but anyway they were they were
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.920]  informed by their wives through text messages that this Joe Stack had attacked
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:29.600]  and they asked what was going on and they said don't worry about it keep this
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.120]  meeting together we have more important things right now well eventually one of
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.160]  the police or fire chief got brave enough to stand up and leave the room and
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.760]  the rest followed after that and they were running a drill that day we first
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.200]  got that within minutes of it happening that fire trucks were already there at
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.720]  the scene as part of a drill on 183 in north Austin but that the police chiefs
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.560]  and the fire chiefs were all in this emergency center drill and we're being
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.880]  told don't leave don't deal with that the feds will handle it and eyewitnesses
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.800]  that we've had on the show at apartments and who were in the building
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.000]  across the street as part of the echelon complex or across the parking lot
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.400]  said that within seconds by the time they looked out the window there was FBI
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:19.120]  out there taking video cameras you know telling people to stand down that it
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.200]  looked very very suspicious and then other witnesses said on record they saw
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.480]  the plane fly by clearly nobody in the cockpit then there were bizarre coverups
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:32.800]  with the body the whole thing was very suspicious right and that's that's what
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.880]  I got from them and of course they were just they're not really into a lot of
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.440]  stuff politically that's going on around them but it even spooked their
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.640]  interest so there's a lot to be said about that Alex. Now you said separately that
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:52.160]  the police officers and and the firefighters that you work with that
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:58.520]  that a lot of them are really awake now. Well yeah especially the troops that I'm
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.720]  with Alex I passed out you know the pocket constitution do you get with
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.480]  every one of your videos or everything that you ordered from MPaWars these
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.040]  citizens rulebook you just every time you order some from MPaWars or you can
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.640]  order a large packet if you're in the military or police department and what I
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:18.560]  did was I passed these out to the guys in my squad and I said guys you know we
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.480]  sworn oath to God to protect the Constitution and the people of the United
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:28.120]  States from enemies sworn domestic we need to learn exactly what is in there
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.880]  you know I ask them questions daily I have them interested in what was going on
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:37.920]  you know and in the late 1700s with our country and what led to that revolution
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:45.120]  and why these documents are so important now. Now let's talk about let's go back
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.280]  to what you witnessed as a police officer during Katrina then let's fast
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:55.360]  forward to the Fort Hood shooter. Okay well I was a police officer down on the
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:59.760]  Gulf Coast I'm gonna leave the city out of it but I was police officer down there
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.680]  in the year of 2006 graduated the police academy with honors started and it
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.080]  within the first week I was training down there with the sergeant and we did
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.520]  a traffic stop on somebody who was in a vehicle in their driveway it wasn't
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.840]  even the keys weren't even in ignition and basically what we did is an illegal
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.960]  search and seizure and at that point I couldn't believe what I've gotten myself
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.640]  into because I was it was like the movie training day Alex have you seen that?
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:33.760]  Yes with Denzel Washington and Keanu Reeves Denzel Washington and what's the
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.960]  other guy's name I forget the point is yeah it wasn't that graphic obviously but
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.520]  these gentlemen did have drugs on them but the way we went about getting them
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.640]  is we compromised our integrity so how are we supposed to be the upright peace
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:52.320]  officers in the community if we break the law that we're sworn to protect to get
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.480]  that illegal illegal drugs or whatever it has to be you know. Well what about the
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.600]  news footage of police tying chains to doors of pawn shops and jewelry shops
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:09.000]  dragging off safes police in Walmart stealing the goodies and then it came
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.680]  out the police were ordered to shoot people who were trying to walk out of
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:17.800]  the Katrina zone in New Orleans. Well thank God Alex I never witnessed any of
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.520]  that because I that would have that would have done it for me but what I did witness is
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.200]  there was a lot of relief coming to the coast from all the good people around
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.040]  around the country and some of the first vehicles there to help with the
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.880]  disaster were Christian release trucks so that'll tell you a lot about people
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:38.520]  who love God and love Jesus and they were there to help but getting back to
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.640]  the corruption the police officers kept everything at the top the generators the
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.760]  good supplies it never trickled down to the citizens and you know I was I was
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:54.240]  a new police officer that time so do and I just sat there and watched it up it
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.680]  was it was known fact in the town where I was a police officer that the assistant
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.680]  chief had burned his car for insurance purposes gotten away with it only to get
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.560]  caught he lost the job for a year and came back and got it just right it right
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:15.080]  off that again assistant police chief again. Now you talk about a culture of
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.960]  corruption in the Gulf you say you haven't seen that in central Texas. No no
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.440]  I haven't Alex and I have a lot of friends that are police officers here in
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.680]  central Texas and and they're all upright family men and and they're all
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.840]  they're all the kind of people that I would be happy to serve next to. Let's
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.680]  talk about I know let's talk about the Fort Hoods shooting because it came out
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:43.640]  in the news that day in the day after that there was a terror attack shooting
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.800]  drill and that a lot of people when he when he was reportedly running around
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:52.480]  shooting men and women in the military that people thought it was part of the
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.880]  drill and I know that they have these biometric face-scanning thumbprint
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.640]  systems that I witnessed in 99 during Operation Urban Warrior on the East
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.200]  Coast in Oakland they were drilling to put American citizens through FEMA
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.920]  camps and a thumbprint them and face scan them I have the video the Marines
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.760]  allowed us to tape of this we know that similar system was used in Fallujah and
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:18.640]  other areas but that the day before they made all the troops at Fort Hood go and
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.800]  be put through the system that they'd been trained to put combatants through
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.600]  and that a lot of people in your unit and others thought it was very suspicious
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.800]  well obviously they couldn't force all the troops to do Alex it was it was a
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:35.160]  directive put out three core wide that everyone would receive the Phantom
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:40.600]  Warrior pass and with that pass you can enter the gate with your ID card just
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:44.920]  scanned by a barcode scanner at the gate and there still is an armed guard there
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.520]  to check your vehicle just to make sure so there's no security issues but but I
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:53.800]  did go up there the day before on November the 4th and when you know
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.320]  everybody said they were gonna just take another picture and give you another
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.320]  ID card and you know I asked the woman behind the counter I said is this
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.040]  biographic you know our biometric technology and she said yes you know
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:08.320]  that software and I said well what is this for and she says well I don't know
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:14.080]  it just came across that that everybody you know has to do it so I don't know
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:19.040]  exactly what it's for I don't necessarily like it just because it just you
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:23.560]  know that much more the grid gets smaller Alex and you know that's that's never
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:29.400]  a good thing Joseph you were saying that the men and women in your unit though
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.840]  were particularly concerned and that you talked to other people that were
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:37.200]  really spooked by what happened and thought it was suspicious that a drill
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:43.920]  was being run and we talked about that off air yeah Alex and once again I you
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.000]  know the Department of Defense policies on this I shouldn't probably comment too
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.640]  much on that but what I what I will talk about is the fact that I served with a
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.240]  lot of brave men and women and and they have really just in the past couple
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.560]  years along with myself kind of just spoken up to the fact that America isn't
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.640]  what it used to be and you know we need to you know take serious our oath you
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:11.880]  know like oath keepers I think they're doing a great service I think everybody
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.760]  I think if you just you know take some take some creed in your oath to God that
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.960]  you swore protect the Constitution and if you study the Constitution to build
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.760]  right and you hold dear to your heart you know and understand you made a covenant
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:30.720]  with the Lord to protect that I think that's very important separately we had
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.360]  a caller from Fort Hood who you told me you actually knew and he called in and
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:41.080]  said look we you know I was in Iraq and there was the head of the Austin SWAT
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:45.280]  team and the head of intelligence were there learning how to set up cordons and
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.280]  martial law and basically door-to-door gun confiscation in Austin and people
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.040]  didn't believe the call but I searched engine did and found the Fort Hood
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.800]  newspaper admitting it you know admitting that they were trained in Iraq
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.080]  and that city officials were out there being trained and then you said that you
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.560]  talked to folks that were aware of that on the base right one of my friends whom
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:12.360]  I work with he knew him personally and he had worked with him so he knew all
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.560]  about it you know once again that's I didn't know too much about it I just
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:21.200]  had secondhand information so but it does seem a little bit odd out it seems a
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.520]  little bit odd and you know we just got to keep our eyes and ears open and we
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:31.600]  have to be good at it but but bottom line I mean it's admitted that Austin
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.200]  police are being sent to Iraq to learn how to set up here what they've done
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.920]  there oh absolutely that was the front page of the Fort Hood newspaper you know
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:44.680]  if somebody's gonna call you conspiracy theorists for claiming that and
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.800]  obviously they're just they're willfully stupid all right Joseph stay there

[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:30.360]  intelligence okay tell folks about anybody can go see this this isn't
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.360]  secret they've put up a big fence around the old sports stadium with barbed
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:39.120]  wire facing in and it's also around the park and you've talked to some of the
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.480]  other military people out there and they think it's suspicious and we went out
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.640]  and looked at it Friday and confirm what you told us right obviously you know
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:51.400]  any sort of barbed wire or constant pinot wire on a military post it happens
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.600]  all the time so you never know when it's you know just a temporary POW camp you
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.840]  know for a mock exercise or something like that but what this is Alex is they
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:05.000]  have 927 million dollars I'm reading straight from the Fort Hood Sentinel
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.280]  right now 927 million dollar center will include a three-story clinic and a
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:13.880]  three-story building that will house several developments there will also be
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.920]  a five-story tower that will house emergency department medical surgery
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.440]  center and intensive care unit now this is this this hospital complex is being
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.320]  built right where Pritzitz Stadium used to be now what they have done is they
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:30.680]  have put up a fence around this facility which is approximately I'd say
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:35.320]  around you know just under 10 acres and it's backed up to a train depot where
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:40.240]  there's four sets of tracks and loading dock now this permanent fencing that
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:45.400]  they've put in they've cemented in the ground as barbed wire facing in now I
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:49.800]  haven't really talked to anybody about that but it just seems a little bit odd
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:54.000]  to me and some of them you know my co-workers just that same thing yeah
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.400]  to be clear you said some of the other folks at the base thought it was
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.480]  suspicious I mean we've been there there is the train tracks it's a lot bigger
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.520]  than just where the hospital is going to be it goes into where a park was I mean
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:09.040]  it's a huge area with barbed wire facing in you can see I'm cementing it you know
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.240]  putting the poles where it faces in with the three lines of barbed wire I mean
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:19.600]  why would you have the facility to where people can get in they just can't get
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:25.040]  out well you know Alex I don't know and you know every day that I pray that
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.600]  there is an honest explanation you know that somebody made a mistake in the
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.160]  planning or execution phase or something like that but we just have to be
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.400]  aware Alex and we have to keep keep passing this information through
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:43.960]  channels so everybody knows what's going on absolutely but I mean if it's if
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.800]  it's facing in and it's not a mistake as they've been building it in the last
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.520]  month I mean they would have already reversed it we have to continue to watch
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:56.640]  this facility but it may be they're gonna have a brig hospital similar to the
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.920]  one where they're holding holding the Fort Hood shooter right now but I mean
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.080]  take the Taylor facility which is an admitted camp for illegal aliens and
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.960]  their families and citizens during emergencies that's been admitted when the
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.320]  public protested they took down the guard towers in the Constantina wire
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.640]  though the 20-foot fences are there and people are still held in it so it shows
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.960]  they try to camouflage this archipelago of prisons and jails as much as they
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.640]  can right Alex I wanted to touch on something that was real near and dear
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:35.280]  to my heart so sure just bear with me up in the military you you guys out there
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:39.560]  listening you guys and girls you do not have to be vaccinated there is a
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:46.200]  religious objection and it's contained in ar-40-562 chapter 2 page 3 I
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.560]  strongly urge any of you people out there that that have a strong religious
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.640]  objection to abort a fetal tissue in the vaccines and the squalene between 80 all
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.600]  the stuff in there that's meant to kill your body and defile your temple I
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:05.960]  strongly suggest you go and read the parameters and start inside ar-40-562
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:11.160]  and if you that's out there that had any vaccination you know I've had some
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.680]  adverse reactions to the anthrax vaccine I contacted some people on the
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.600]  internet that protecting our guardians just Google protecting our guardian and
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.920]  they're a great Christian organization nonprofit and they helped me along the
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.200]  way they're great people there and there's great support all over on by the
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.840]  way they suspended the anthrax shot in the mid 90s again in 2000 and again last
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:37.840]  year they know it's experimental but they lie to the troops and don't tell
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:41.040]  them there's a waiver but you don't even need a waiver for an experimental
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.240]  vaccine Congress and the courts have found it's illegal to give experimental
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.600]  vaccines to troops have you now seen wired magazine they want to give you
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:55.000]  these these vaccines that change your brain oh yeah I read all about it it's
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.880]  frightening I mean that's really scary it's frightening and I guarantee the
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:04.680]  first people that to have those vaccines will be the men and women serving
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:08.040]  the armed forces yeah you're not getting pigs and they want to go get getting
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:14.160]  pigs rodents and do it but but not our men and women in the military I agree
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.480]  out it's it's something we should we should be able to object to and I have
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:22.200]  I wrote that letter and my chain of command has been great with it all the
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:27.080]  way up and down and just really support my right to object religiously and the

[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:19.680]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:23.960]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:28.120]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:32.440]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every

[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:50.920]  here today going over all of this information that there's obviously a
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:56.400]  lot that I want to ask you if CNBC saying it's a depression on a recession the
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.880]  Federal Reserve coming out today and saying we are in deep trouble we've got
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.640]  more of the same poison as the solution but with everything happened
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:07.360]  happening just break down the current trends and what you think is most
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:11.280]  important before I start asking questions well they're admitting what we've been
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.960]  saying all along that there would be no recovery this isn't a double dip
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:21.240]  recession we never got out of the first dip and we kept saying over and over and
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:26.600]  over that you cannot keep printing this this phantom money out of thin air back
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.800]  by nothing and producing practically nothing it was just a cover-up now
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:39.040]  unfortunately as we've also been saying all along when all else fails they take
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:47.400]  you to war it's as almost though Orwell wrote the script last week our esteemed
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:53.680]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in of all places Vietnam could you
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:59.440]  imagine in Vietnam now the United States is making a military alliance with
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:06.160]  those Vietnamese remember how the US government sent over some 60,000 of our
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:11.400]  soldiers to get slaughtered that's how many were killed in the Vietnam War
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:17.320]  several hundred thousand ruined millions of Vietnamese killed and now
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:24.120]  they're according to Ms. Clinton our strategic ally and the dispute going on
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:31.440]  between Vietnam and China over islands in the South China Sea she said quote
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:41.760]  are of national US interest no they're not they are I am a national and they're
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:47.600]  not of my interest and I don't need her or any other flunky out there telling
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:53.520]  me what my interest is being that I pay for this stuff so what they're doing is
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:59.280]  they're bringing us into closer into wars all over the globe and as we heard
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:07.800]  Fidel Castro say this past weekend the Iranians are not going to tolerate the
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:15.520]  United States or Great Britain or any other flunky ally boarding their ships
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:22.360]  to see what's on board come September is setting us up for war and I want to
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:28.960]  make this really clear Alex anybody that's voting for war against Iran let
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:35.560]  them pack up them there themselves their wives and their kids and go fight the
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:41.920]  war and empty out your bank accounts and go support it and all these people
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:49.200]  that call themselves leaders let them lead us into war let Hillary and Bill
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:57.160]  and little baby Chelsea and her husband let them go to war let Pelosi let Frank
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:04.360]  let Bonerland bond let McConnell let them go to war if they don't go to war if
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:11.040]  these wankers on the council on foreign affairs don't go to war as these
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:17.520]  swivel chair generals yak it up on the media don't go to war then there's no
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:24.520]  war until they go until they put their lives on the line and the war the wars
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:31.360]  of bankrupting this country I heard that other guy that Krugman today writing
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:36.320]  from the toilet paper of record the New York Times saying what's wrong with this
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:43.200]  country and what needs to be done to correct it not one inch not one line of
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:49.080]  the wars that are draining the Treasury and then you pick up today's
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:56.640]  newspaper hey United States just did a $30 billion deal with Saudi Arabia you
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:01.960]  know that wonderful democracy over there 30 billion dollars worth of planes
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:09.400]  being sold it's all a racket at 16 years paragraph well Gerald you're
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:14.720]  absolutely right and it's in the news but it's in the back of the paper that
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:19.160]  Israel is planning to strike Iran in the next three months and you would think
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.880]  this would be a bigger issue because every analyst out there agrees it runs
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:28.280]  from bad to worse at least doubling oil prices they'll use the war as a police
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:33.160]  state crackdown Obama will use it as a way to rally people around him going
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:37.320]  into the election you could easily trigger terror attacks in the United
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:43.320]  States and could trigger World War three with China and Russia with Pakistan
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:47.000]  and India they could go to war most analysts agree there's a good chance
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.120]  World War 3 could start and they're about to launch this and it's not even a
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:55.720]  major news item instead we're hearing about Lindsay Lohan well again this
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:01.920]  this country's turn snooki stupid I heard Obama on the view had a watch this
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.600]  stuff to see what he says and that's exactly what they're talking about the
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:12.560]  president of the United States has nothing else to do with his time than to
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:19.120]  sit down with five gaggling women talking about Lindsay Lohan Mel Gibson
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:25.800]  and snooki the New York Times again the toilet paper of record a whole big
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:34.240]  feature on snooki why do we even know this stuff it's it's perfect bread and
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:40.960]  circuses as the Empire is declining so when we go back to Iran and we just put
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:46.080]  out a trend alert you got it about why Obama won't won't debate with Ahmad
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:50.920]  Diderjad over these issues well I have to tell you subscribers to the trends
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:59.000]  journal criticizing us for saying that listen why don't they debate and people
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.400]  are going to once again be led into a fake war just as they did with Bush and
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:10.560]  they're going to do it again with Obama in Iran and you hit it perfectly
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:17.160]  it will be another excuse to tighten up on the police state antics that are
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:23.280]  already in place because after all Alex they're just doing it to protect us well
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:28.920]  let me look at the nation it's disintegrating from Ohio to California
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:33.120]  many cities are laying off and counties more than half their deputies are
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:37.880]  police LA's announcing they're not gonna fix many roads and sidewalks they're
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:42.080]  announcing massive layoffs at the state and local level corporations are
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.600]  shutting down they admit we're going into a depression a double-dip
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:50.160]  recession and then meanwhile the federal government's hiring they're
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:54.480]  increasing wages the defense budget's going up they're talking about two
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:00.400]  trillion and additional lending by banks that will go on the taxpayer roles I
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:05.760]  mean you can see this global elite using up the treasure of the Empire we're
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:10.440]  bankrupt and they are showing that instead of slowing down they're
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:16.800]  accelerating us towards financial and economic and military ruin again you're
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:24.680]  right and this isn't rhetoric we just lost Gerald's audio joining us via New
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:33.480]  York we'll get that hooked back up with him right now was that on our end or on
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.920]  his end guys
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.000]  that happens occasionally you know it's the wonders of video while we're at it
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.080]  let's get him to tip the camera now Gerald Salenta again breaking all of
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:53.040]  this down with us and next hour we're gonna have the phones open they're open
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:46:00.280]  now 1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us I mean look at this
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:05.220]  economic news economic slowdown catches up with NASCAR they're no longer jam
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:09.160]  packed they're seeing the tickets go way down in price and a lot smaller crowds
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:12.760]  it's even affecting NASCAR and the government saying let them eat cake
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:17.440]  everything's wonderful we told you last week this was coming with Bob Chapman
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:22.520]  now here it is in the Financial Times of London Fed set to downgrade US outlook
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:28.840]  for US I mean they knew full well that the stimulus was just gonna line their
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:32.120]  pockets and there need to be another one and another one but all of this gets
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:39.120]  put back on the backs of the American people but I wanted to read this
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:49.440]  headline to Gerald Salenta and get his comment on it here's a CNBC headline from
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.960]  today we are in equivalent of Great Depression and they go on to list that
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:47:01.280]  the graphs for the stock market and the economy and for equities is identical
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:07.080]  from 29 to 33 and it took three years for them to admit we were in a depression
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:10.800]  and now I'm seeing mainstream articles every day saying we're in a depression
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:14.640]  but their answer is give the bankers more power let the Securities and
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:19.880]  Exchange Commission have total secrecy on who it prosecutes for derivatives
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:23.720]  corruption and who it doesn't and we see the Federal Reserve setting up a new
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:27.880]  private board with even more power over the economy when they're the same group
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:31.400]  that did it and we have Chelsea marrying this Goldman Sachs exec whose
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:36.280]  congressman father's in prison for stealing 11 million from taxpayers and
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:41.760]  it's let them eat cake and you've got Marie Antoinette Michelle Obama Michelle
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:47.240]  Sitaro running around on taxpayer money and Obama's having all these parties
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:51.800]  with rock stars and on the view and even mainstream media Gerald is saying
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:55.640]  what you were saying six months ago it's let them eat cake the New York Daily
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:59.480]  News had that headline that that they just don't care they're rubbing in our
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:04.320]  faces they're laughing at us they're arrogant again you know before we got
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:11.400]  cut off 90% of the wealth 93% of the wealth is controlled by 10% of the
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:16.360]  nation I mean you know I'm not making these numbers up that means the rest of
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:22.080]  us are there to cut up that other seven percent we have 10 banks controlling
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:29.320]  80% of the assets it's a takeover and I get a kick out of this Alex as you will
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.060]  know we've been talking about the greatest oppression since the crash
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:42.800]  happened in 2008 and everyone out there in the mainstream media either the New
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:51.600]  York Times called what I'm doing quote pessimism porn until their own flunkies
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:59.320]  start seeing it and then it's genius analysis when Krugman comes up with it
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:07.440]  two years too late and about 11 trillion dollars spent and he had a full
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:11.720]  solution give the Federal Reserve more money give the Federal Reserve the very
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:16.640]  crux that orchestrated this more power yeah exactly that's like you having a
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:21.320]  second mortgage and you're really in trouble hey Alex how about a third
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:28.120]  mortgage this thing is going under here's our message for everyone only the
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:34.960]  strong are going to survive this you better be in shape physically
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:40.960]  spiritually and emotionally there's no salvation for these rest of the people
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:47.200]  that are waiting for their leaders to lead them the game is over they're going
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:53.200]  to keep conning the people every time there's a bit of rosy economic news to
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:59.320]  make it appear that things are okay you better start planning now for the winter
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:08.640]  there could not be a better grasshopper and ant scenario in place and they're
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:12.640]  not lying about the economy and telling you things are getting better so that we
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.640]  have better confidence they're doing it so we politically don't get angry and
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:20.680]  take control of our government it's our country it's our republic and put in
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:24.240]  policies that would have averted and fixed this but I know you and many other
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:29.280]  experts say that it's now too far gone we're going into the ground we're going
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:33.760]  into the ground there's only to me there are a couple of things that could be done
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:38.920]  and one of them again I said this about a new alternative energy something
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:43.320]  bigger than wind solar geothermal biofuel just like we had the internet
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:49.760]  revolution that got us out of the 1990s mess number and number two we have to

[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:44.920]  time to talk with Gerald but having a few breakups via our video connection but
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.920]  that we're very honored to have him here's some really bad news Rand Paul is
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.160]  seen as the leader of the true tea party movement right now they pulled out the
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:58.760]  stops they had a video feed where he couldn't hear him with a two second
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:03.080]  delay and they said do you support repealing the civil rights act and he
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:08.600]  said yes yes I can't hear you yes I can hear you now and then he said no I don't
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:13.360]  agree with getting rid of it now that's a quote then they took his yes yes now I
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:17.400]  can hear you he was having problems just like Gerald is with a connection and
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:23.120]  they ran with the headline he wants to get rid of the civil rights act and that
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:27.440]  was a national hoax now I don't mean to divert I want to get into the other
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:30.560]  ways he's saying we can protect ourselves and more of his trends forecast
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:34.280]  it's been so devastatingly accurate here's the horrible news though
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:41.200]  Washington Post GQ as magazine woman says Rand Paul kidnapped her in
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.560]  college tried to force her to take bong hits and folks I'll bet you my bottom
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:51.740]  dollar you know we've got Al Gore with the semen stained clothing with this
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:56.720]  other woman and that's being covered up but with Rand Paul this is just this is
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:00.080]  on the Gerald we're gonna see more and more desperate stuff like this aren't
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.640]  we yeah yeah that sounds like a story they could have ran about me and it might
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:13.200]  have been true oh boy you know what this interview so important with Gerald we're
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:18.440]  now going to just go to regular phone line with him and get his take on this
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:22.720]  while we're reconnecting skype's a wonderful technology you can have him up
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:26.440]  there in clear living color for the video viewers at prison planet dot TV but
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:30.560]  we're having a problems we're gonna go to phone line now here it is GQ woman says
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:35.240]  Rand Paul kidnapped her in college tried to force me to take bong hits Rand
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:39.080]  Paul's educational experience was under scrutiny last week when the Lexington
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:44.160]  Harold reported that the doctor never got a bachelor's degree and that's not
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.880]  true he left Bayer Baylor University in Texas when Duke accepted him in medical
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:53.480]  school well a lot of people don't know that a lot of doctors and people they
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:57.560]  already have either in college they have high-grade scores they can be
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:01.880]  accepted to a medical school and the medical schools do that he went on it
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:05.400]  says and they've also claimed that he hasn't kept his license up which is not
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.600]  illegal but you know they claim it's a problem now GQ has an article on Paul's
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:16.320]  college years is likely to raise more questions do we have Gerald back the
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:21.040]  strangest episode of Paul's time at Baylor occurred one afternoon in 83 so
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.920]  they're reporting it as if it's true although memories about all these
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:28.040]  events are understandably a bit hazy so the date might be slightly off when he
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:32.920]  was a nose a brother a fellow member of a secret society and so now they're
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:36.600]  spinning being in a regular fraternity as a secret society just all crafted to
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:40.680]  make his base hating a fellow member of a secret society knows a brotherhood
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:44.760]  paid a visit to a female student who was one of Paul's teammates at the Baylor
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:48.360]  swim team according to this woman who requested anonymity oh that's another
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:53.320]  big red flag because of her current job as a clinical psychologist oh give me a
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:57.320]  break another one of those people he said ran came to my house knocked on my
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:01.360]  door and then blindfolded me tied me up and put me in the car they took me to
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:04.600]  their apartment and tried to force me to take bomb hits they've been smoking
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:08.200]  pot after the woman refuses smoke with them Paul and his friend put her back on
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:12.040]  the car and drove her to countryside over Waco or they stopped near a creek they
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:16.480]  told me that their god was aqua Buddha and that they needed to bow down and
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:20.480]  worship him the woman recalls the blindfolded me and made me bow down to
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:25.040]  aqua Buddha in the creek I had to say I worshipped aqua Buddha this is made this

[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:53.760]  at this grace they call themselves the media how about calling yourself a
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:02:02.480]  little puppet continue well the what we're saying here Alex is that when this
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:08.120]  new when the elections come up in in in November there's not gonna be any change
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:13.360]  yet because going to the Republicans from the Democrats is it's a two-headed
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:20.200]  one-party system you know people ask me who would I vote for and I say I will on
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:25.000]  the social issues in terms of the environment clean food and and those
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.040]  kind of things I would vote for Ralph Nader on terms of the economy not
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:35.560]  becoming involved in foreign entanglements Iran Paul and that's what
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:41.240]  this country is looking for not these do you want to talk about centrist parties
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:47.320]  we don't have centrist parties we have radical fascist parties here's an
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:52.720]  example you know that wonderful little story that came out last week about in

[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:56.520]  small scale I don't think that's relevant our role is to protect the public

[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:29.720]  common info wars dot com you know Gerald if you just joined us just brought up
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:33.880]  the lemonade stand in Portland Oregon these little girls six and seven they
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:38.120]  wanted 150 bucks from them it's the mafia but then I was mentioning the
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:43.400]  more famous cases out there where the IRS visits with armed agents twice saying
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:47.080]  pay your four cent bill at a car wash and it's been admitted even in the Wall
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:52.120]  Street Journal that in the last decade they've shifted the IRS to focus on
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:56.960]  blue collar not even white collar so you got the crooks in the system trying to
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:01.480]  protect themselves and Gerald mentioned how Tyson and others they can have
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.600]  literally in some cases hundreds of times the violations of even other big
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:10.280]  companies but they're allowed to operate same thing with BP in Houston and
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:15.680]  Texas City and here's the headline Tyson's profit surges while everybody
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:21.200]  else's goes down so it shows how it's a big boys game it's a it's a monopoly
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:27.000]  game Gerald Solente it is and it's becoming more and more like that I
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.480]  said this is the beginning as people have been complaining about Obama and
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:36.440]  calling him a socialist and a communist as this fascism the merger of state and
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:40.760]  corporate powers you just look at the numbers they're all there pick the sector
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:46.320]  real as you view the banking sector as I mentioned 10 banks control 80% of the
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:50.880]  action you look at agriculture a couple of big firms control most of the
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:56.840]  business you look at drugs go down the line retail you know Walmart is taken
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:01.520]  over the country every sector they're squeezing out the little people and all
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:06.420]  the regulations are being tilted as you mentioned whether it's the IRS or the
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:12.080]  sales tax people going door-to-door to pizza places and beauty parlors shaking
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:16.360]  down for every last cent whether letting the big criminals run free you
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:21.040]  know you mentioned about the Clintons and this guy this Goldman Sachs guy she
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:26.240]  married you know the trends research Institute began in Rhinebeck where they
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:32.680]  got married in 1980 and we left Rhinebeck about three years ago because the
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:37.280]  neighborhood started going bad people like the Clintons started coming up
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:41.360]  there you know it was all of these people that think they're better than
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:48.160]  everybody else because after all Alex you see it any place they arrive in a
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:53.200]  foreign country you know they're waving from the top of their jumbo jet and by
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:57.760]  the time they get to the to the to the down the gangplank you know they have
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:02.440]  bowing dignitaries in a red carpet rolled out I'm not kidding you we
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:08.560]  left Rhinebeck because the place got a bit too white for me and it was all of
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:13.720]  these arrogant people the kind you know that go to the Hamptons started finding
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:18.200]  a different location you know that was north in the country and these are the
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.360]  people it's on and on again that they actually believe that they're entitled
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:29.280]  and it's just like Michelle Obama going to Spain how could anybody with any
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.720]  dignity put on such a spectacle like that you know if you're going to go on a
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:39.840]  vacation do it quietly rather than disrupting everything around you and
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:44.160]  they demanded that entire beaches be shut down so she could frolic around with
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:49.600]  their girls this is the new royalty but the good news is Barry Sataro aka
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:54.240]  Barack Obama has the lowest approval rating now of any president in history
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:59.160]  at this point and they're in free fall get into your forecast because you
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:04.320]  accurately said you'll start seeing entire police forces disband I see that
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:09.360]  every day in smaller forces larger forces like out in Oakland they announced
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:14.000]  we're not going to respond to armed robbery to car theft to home invasion
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:19.080]  we're hearing they're not going to fix the sidewalks so they're raising the
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:25.320]  taxes as all of the basic services are being removed or restricted and they're
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:28.680]  slapping toll roads on major roads to give the profits to foreign offshore
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:32.800]  corporations and they just think this gravy train is going to go on forever
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.440]  and now they want to start a new war that will further bankrupt us and now
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:40.040]  they're having to admit we're going into a depression and you've said you see it
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:44.680]  really breaking out by the end of this year how do you see the dominoes falling
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:50.400]  it looks like a currency crisis to us that that's what we're looking at but
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:56.040]  again there are so many wild cards for example in September if the United
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:01.080]  States and this is flunky allies begin to board or attempt to board
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:06.720]  Iranian ships that could be the kind of thing that really throws the world
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:11.360]  economy into a death spiral look what's going on right now again these are the
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:16.920]  things that you can't predict what's going on in in Russia with this horrible
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:22.000]  heatwave and and and really the destruction of so much of its wheat
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.920]  crop and then you look in what's going on in a lot of Asia particularly Pakistan
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:31.680]  with all of these floods so you have a button and then of course in the United
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:37.160]  States with our own disasters man made by BP which of course everything's okay
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:42.360]  now and by the way this is important Alex you look what's going on in Russia
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:48.360]  in Pakistan what's going on in the US in every instance you're hearing the
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:54.200]  people complaining about how unresponsive the governments are they're going
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:59.080]  crazy right now in Russia they're firing people same thing in Pakistan and of
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.960]  course we see with the Katrina quality rescue skills in the US here's what
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:11.600]  every thinking adult has to grow up to there's nobody there to lead you or to
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:17.920]  save you I don't care what country it is governments by their nature are run
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:23.400]  by people that are basically sociopaths that are only interested in their own
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:29.160]  power and could care less about you and their incompetence they've never worked
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:34.200]  a day in their life most of them they've only learned how to game the system to
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:41.440]  get a cushy political job so when we crash before 2010 happens people better
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:47.280]  be prepared for it they better be able to weather this storm because if there's
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:53.800]  war with Iran as you will mention you're going to see oil prices skyrocket you're
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:59.200]  going to see gold prices go through the roof you're going to see hyperinflation
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:05.000]  and you're going to see the government crack down on the people like you could
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.960]  never imagine and we've seen the buildup for this police state and they now
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:13.080]  admit we want to use the army we want to use the Marine Corps against you we're
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:17.760]  going to federalize your local towns the the establishment the ruling rats the
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:21.480]  ruling class they they've been preparing for this they knew what happened ten
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:24.840]  years ago and they started selling these derivatives they knew what was going to
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.560]  happen you could look at it four or five years ago and forecast the collapse of
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:32.800]  2008 and further forecast that we weren't in a recovery we were just
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:37.000]  continuing the collapse so they know what they're doing but I think they've
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.800]  miscalculated that they're going to get away with it they thought Obama could be
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:46.360]  sold as this Messianic leader but Humpty Dumpty has fallen off the wall and the
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.240]  next Republican savior they give us unless it's Ron Paul isn't going to be
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:55.680]  able to reverse this so I happen to agree with you and unfortunately most
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:59.000]  other analysts are now agreeing with you that it's going to get bad but you're
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:05.560]  saying pretty soon I mean how bad will this collapse get it'll be we're going
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:08.960]  to see I don't look look at the unemployment numbers are ready what
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:14.840]  we just lose another 131,000 jobs were lost in in July and what do we have to
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:20.520]  do we have to create 1.25 million a year just to stay even and then they then
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:29.200]  they the June numbers were revised to 221,000 a 220 yeah 221,000 lost from
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:35.480]  125,000 they just keep lying and they say that the that the unemployment rates
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:40.960]  only 9.5% yeah people drop off the list and no longer getting unemployment
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:44.840]  they're no longer counted who can make this up we're going to see
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:49.240]  unemployment worse than the Great Depression we're going to see people
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:53.400]  that are incapable unlike the Great Depression of taking care of themselves
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:58.400]  we're going to see crime at levels that they're not going to be able to deal
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:04.080]  with and I hear all of these these white shoe boy guys from Harvard Princeton
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:10.080]  Yale trying to convince the people there's no correlation between people
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:16.920]  losing everything having no jobs losing their houses and increases in crime you
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:20.280]  know one of my six years old you're talking to me you know tell this to
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:25.800]  some stupid kid in high school well even their economic numbers that are
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:29.640]  showing things worsening are admittedly cooked and then for the last year they
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:33.040]  said don't worry there's no radiation from the naked-body scanners and we're
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:37.160]  not saving the images and we don't see your genitals and now it turns out they
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:41.840]  got mobile vans with it federal state courthouses the airports they were
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:46.880]  saving it all from the beginning and lying I mean that shows a arrogance and
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:53.040]  a hubris or a hootspa that is just off the charts Gerald for them to knowingly
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:58.720]  lie about everything I mean it's certainly getting worse I mean I mean I
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:02.720]  guess if they've told a million lies why not tell a million more exactly you
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:06.920]  know I was just on Fox this past week and it was this guy from Washington I
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:11.440]  forgot and I was saying how bad things are going to get and this guy comes out
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:17.960]  and starts saying well you know in 1983 we were in a very similar situation and
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:22.040]  the United States ingenuity don't underestimate the American worker that's
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:28.840]  what got us out of it I said listen this is in 1983 in 1983 there was a Soviet
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:33.960]  Union we didn't have all of this world trade with China it was still communist
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:39.160]  China they weren't eating up the global marketplace these are very different
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:46.280]  times and what do we have Alex we have a bunch of experts in the past they keep
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:52.000]  counting about how brilliant Benaki is and a scholar of the great depression
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:58.400]  this isn't a great depression this is 2010 and we have a bunch of incompetence
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:03.920]  that are leading this nation down the drain selling it out and mock my words
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:09.360]  they're leading us to war and whether it's going through Israel or somewhere
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:17.280]  else we're going to see war coming soon and they know that and they need that as
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:21.240]  a political diversion and they know we're bankrupt they know globalism has
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:27.560]  decimated our industry they know this is in 1983 and they they count on the
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:32.600]  American people laying down and watching Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:39.360]  Tyson and all these insiders get richer at our expense but we see the major
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:43.400]  political realignment taking place everything you've predicted now

[02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:09.320]  got some other news to be talking about before he leaves us with Gerald Salente
[02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:14.200]  the top trends forecaster right now let's go to your phone calls Brian in
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:19.280]  Tennessee you're on the air with our guests go ahead hi Alex hello Mr.
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:25.200]  Salente hello Brian I've got about three points I want to touch on real quick the
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:28.240]  first two I want to talk to Mr. Salente and Alex I want to talk to you about the
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:32.680]  Constitution that's the last point being my most important so don't let me go
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:39.920]  too quickly but Mr. Salente I was going to talk to you about the illegal
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:46.520]  immigration problem the 30 million illegals in this country that are working
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:51.280]  many of which are getting paid under the table that are not on record with the
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:57.160]  IRS they're not getting taxed for their labor I would I want to ask you sir do
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:03.880]  you think that that would be a large percentage added to our unemployment rate
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:07.840]  if we knew how many millions of these illegals were working and getting paid
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:11.680]  under the table how far up do you think that and let me throw this caveat
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:15.600]  into the question they're enforcing on lemonade stands and car washes for
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.880]  four cents but the illegals are basically left alone so that's kind of a
[02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:25.560]  quasi legal black market via selective enforcement and the illegals can come
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:30.360]  here and have their baby here and have it paid for by taxpayers at one hospital
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:36.120]  in Dallas this year 11,071 babies born to be legals who become citizens and
[02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:40.760]  most of the births it was free paid for by tax money that's the Dallas Morning
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:46.960]  News Gerald your comments on that well you know obviously that you know we just
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:52.080]  don't have the jobs to support all these illegal immigrants and either it is a
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:59.200]  global issue by the way you name the country France Italy Spain every
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:04.040]  country is facing this huge problem of trying to get rid of illegal aliens and
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:10.160]  by the way this is all that news to us we wrote in trends 2000 I wrote that book
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:17.760]  in 1996 about the huge illegal alien problem that was going to confront the
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:22.200]  United States and there was a whole story about migration being a threat to
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:27.280]  global stability and here's the here's the here's the key in all this you know
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:33.480]  who encouraged it try people like the National Association of Manufacturers
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:38.800]  try people like Microsoft it was all of these people that encouraged the
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:43.760]  opening of our borders to bring in cheap labor to keep wages down so their
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:49.160]  profits could go up period paragraph it has nothing to do with human rights it
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:53.680]  has nothing to do with the with being compassionate it had to do with the
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:59.200]  bottom line we saw the problem coming we wrote about it and once again you know
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:04.440]  the it's a question between when you look at the mainstream media
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:09.240]  political correctness and pettiness and that's the way they treat these issues
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:14.360]  and they're using these domestic groups as a political army predominantly from
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:18.360]  Mexico where they're pulling down American flags in public making kids
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:22.560]  including Hispanic kids go home from San Francisco schools that wear American
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:27.120]  flags and we've now got an infowars.com story Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:34.240]  gave millions to La Raza including six hundred thousand dollars just in one
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:39.520]  gift six million six hundred and sixty one thousand in another gift to
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:45.200]  literally fund the breakdown of this country and now we go bankrupt they're
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:49.560]  laying off the police the hospitals are going bankrupt every day I see it and
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:53.080]  we're told you don't want government-run health care you're a racist you don't
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.920]  want to pay for people's free babies I don't get to go every time I've had three
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:02.080]  children I pay money I pay a lot of money I mean what this isn't fair Gerald
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:07.480]  here's from here's from trends 2000 again this is nineteen nineteen ninety-five
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:12.440]  I wrote this a seventy seventy seven percent of the people surveyed in a
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:17.360]  nineteen ninety four times CNN Paul felt that governments were not doing
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:23.440]  enough to keep out illegal immigrants this has been a huge issue and the only
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:26.880]  reason they haven't been doing anything again let's just call it what it is
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:31.760]  is to undercut the labor market with cheap labor that's it nothing which
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:35.880]  doesn't help the economy it destroys the base everything because it brings down
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:40.200]  the whole standard of living it's like buying it's like they're trying to tell
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:45.080]  people how wonderful it is to go to Walmart to save three cents on something
[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:48.840]  because it's getting made in China and we don't have to have those dirty
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:54.480]  manufacturing jobs they use that pay high wages and instead now you become a
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:59.440]  service sector society think of the word they say this all the time you break out
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:05.880]  the word surf servant servitude we went from a country of craftsmen a country of
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:12.840]  merchants a country of of of of mom and pop business artisans actually is and
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:17.480]  now look what we become cashiers shelf stockers and clerks Brian I gotta move
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:19.720]  quick what was your other point because we got a bright we'll come back and
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:25.320]  answer it well I want to have two points is that okay no you don't have one
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:28.960]  point I want I just want to say that I admire Joseph for bringing up the
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:31.800]  Constitution because the only way that we're gonna defeat it's not big
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:35.280]  government everybody knows that the secret societies like the Illuminati
[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:39.040]  have run this world since ancient Egypt that the only way that we can defeat them
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:43.720]  is through the ninth and tenth amendment Americans have to be educated about the
[02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:48.680]  ninth and tenth because in the night it says that your rights are permanent they
[02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:52.600]  cannot be taken away because they can't hear you Brian we're on the March the

[02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:24.800]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:29.360]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:52.760]  Journal I know there's TrendsResearch.com but how do they get the quarterly
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:57.920]  report well they go to our Trends Journal login and they can have all the
[02:33:57.920 --> 02:34:02.120]  information there and I want to make this very clear we make the Trends
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:06.440]  Journal available to virtually everyone regardless we know a lot of people
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:11.560]  having very difficult times so there's a discount request form for all those that
[02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:17.480]  are having a difficult time because in what we're facing here Alex is that the
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:22.400]  Trends Journal as you well know it's not about fear it's about empowerment
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:28.000]  so what we do is we have trend posts suggestions to take directions to go
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.120]  and right now people really have to start thinking in those terms and
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:38.240]  particularly all these kids that got out of college that are deep in debt that
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:43.360]  are never going to be able to pay it off like by declaring bankruptcy because
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:49.400]  they're not allowed to what direction they need to go in now to really secure
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:53.520]  their future and they have to get out of their houses they have to start
[02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:58.360]  breaking the strings their parents and really moving out on their own and what
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:04.400]  we see is there's a great opportunity now to rejuvenate this country you can
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:10.680]  buy houses in major cities that are in Detroit's that are in much better shape
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:16.520]  for virtually what you can buy a used car for and now is the time to start
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:22.320]  getting on you out on your own but also as I hear that get off the grid dot com
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:28.320]  those kind of things and actions to take so the Trends Journal is an overview of
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:33.880]  what's going on and how you can prepare for the future before it hits you and
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:37.800]  more and more it's not just lemonade stands being harassed every week I see
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:42.240]  articles of people selling eggs in the country watermelons squash onions and
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:46.720]  they have undercovers that come and buy it from them then arrest them for
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:51.640]  supposedly not paying a few dollars of taxes you can see the system hates the
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:57.680]  grassroots and hates individuals trying to just tread water and be self-sufficient
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:02.400]  but then the illegal aliens in 800 plus sanctuary cities they're allowed to drunk
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:08.640]  drive mug people whatever this government hates the blue collar working
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:12.840]  people unless you're on welfare they want you dependent on them as a voting
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:18.720]  block or they want you in prison we have aristocratic criminals that's all it is
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:25.600]  it's a new aristocratic criminal class and it's the Bush administration it was
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:31.520]  the Clinton administration and now it's the Obama administration it's the two
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:36.440]  headed one-party system and by the way aristocratic criminals by the way you're
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:40.560]  right Gerald if you study feudalism whether it was in Japan or Europe in the
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:45.880]  last 600 700 years feudalism is about turning resources off to the general
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:50.760]  public to make them poor and dumb down to control them I mean this is admitted
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:54.480]  the globalists with their carbon taxes it's not about helping the environment
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:58.920]  it's about them being a mafia and being able to say who can have a factory who
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:02.960]  can have a business who can have a job and then if you're on the inside crew of
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:07.160]  the Harvard boys the Princeton boys that you talk so much about then you can do
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:11.040]  whatever you want and not follow any regulations but if you're a red-blooded
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:15.120]  American regardless of what color you are what religion you try to start a
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:19.880]  company or something they harass you out of existence exactly and the people that
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:27.120]  are the enforcers are just merely the flunkies for the big guys I've told you
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:31.360]  this story I began my career as the assistant to the Secretary of the New
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:36.000]  York State Senate at a graduate school after putting on campaigns in West
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:41.360]  Chester County it was the worst job ever had to watch grown men sucking up
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:47.040]  that's all it is so in order for them to preserve their jobs they have to make
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:51.480]  sure they're they're bringing in the dough and they bring in the dough by
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:57.160]  finding the little people whether it's the cop out there that's watching you go
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:03.560]  over that double yellow line or whether it's again going into the pizza joint to
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:07.360]  make sure you paid all your sales tax and expanding on that and then we're
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:11.880]  going to calls in the last three weeks I've been tuning in more to the
[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:15.800]  rebroadcast of it to because it's so amazing limbaugh has come out and I've
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:20.520]  read the transcripts here on air and said it's the blue bloods out of Harvard
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:26.600]  and Princeton it's the rich elites it's a it's a club it's about kissing up they
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:30.520]  want to destroy America to make us dependent on them it's a world government
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:35.440]  it's a new world order these people are scam artist it's it's about who you know
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:40.000]  not who you are and they want to destroy the middle class I mean that's a big deal
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.560]  to have limbaugh finally start sounding like Gerald Salenta or Alex Jones well
[02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:48.240]  that we don't these guys do Alex they pick on on they pick up on what we say
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:52.280]  and then they milk it whether they believe it or not because he's one of
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:56.120]  them and he keeps sucking up to him you know so that's what they do I've been
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:01.160]  around this game long enough and it's good media for them but no one could
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.440]  deny it now look I'm getting these calls about people's writing now about the
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:13.220]  second American Revolution yeah pick up the the was it the the the autumn 2009
[02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:18.320]  Trends Journal the headline the second American Revolution now it's here and
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:23.920]  and this is the other thing and it's so true forget the big lie that all you have
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:29.160]  to do in America is work hard and put your nose to the grindstone and you're
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:34.400]  gonna make it to the top yeah you can and you could also win the lotto yes
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:41.040]  some people do but the reality is the only reason that these guys make several
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:45.160]  hundred million dollars a year is because they're members of the club and
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:50.120]  they're doing the inside deals we're gonna go to calls but you're absolutely
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:55.760]  right on that front and something you've talked about for the decade was the
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:01.120]  college bubble and now I've suddenly seen it's got to be 10 or 15 in the last
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:08.120]  two weeks big top magazines reporting you know college won't get you a job most
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:12.280]  degrees are worthless so now I guess they're getting ready to pop that bubble
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:17.480]  telling mom and dad that sunk a hundred grand into a four-year education that
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:21.520]  sorry your little sweetheart your little delicate genius is gonna be bagging
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:25.880]  groceries meanwhile the guy that started mowing lawns 20 years ago he's living
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:29.120]  in a half million dollar house or the artisan that knows how to put in wood
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:33.040]  molding he's living in a half million dollar house cuz he knows how to bust his
[02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:38.200]  butt not go to college again you know I you've heard me say this again you know
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:43.200]  they're catching up to us and it's a waste of money unless you're going for
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:49.280]  a degree that's going to pay a return on investment I read this story woman
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:54.520]  she's a hundred thousand dollars and that went to NYU and I'm slaving through
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:41:00.120]  this rotten story to find out I wonder what she took you know she took women's
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:07.080]  history and religion you went to college for that I mean she could have sat
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:11.400]  there and read 20 books and gotten the same knowledge exactly and become an
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:16.480]  apprentice start getting out there and go the old way it used to be don't waste
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:21.080]  your money on a degree in business that's right find a find a company where
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:24.720]  you can work hard where you've got upward mobility where you get rewarded for
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:29.200]  smarts and hard labor folks this country was built on people busting their butts
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:33.560]  not on working for mega global corporations let's talk to Michael in
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:43.120]  Florida you're on the air Michael I want to thank y'all for you know at least
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:48.520]  talking to people caring enough and you know sticking to what's important as
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:53.720]  you have a lot of times I heard you talking to people who disagree a lot of
[02:41:53.720 --> 02:41:59.000]  times people just want to say red because you said blue you say this guy is
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:03.040]  blue they'll say it's red that's another point how much have I been right about
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:07.280]  how much is Gerald and Dr. Roberts but it's not even that hard if you study
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:11.400]  history study how these elites operate I mean we're telling people common sense
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:15.520]  and and still the establishment tries to make fun of us but it doesn't matter
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:21.480]  their stocks going down our stocks going up ignoring the truth doesn't make it go
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:26.520]  away yes sir and a lot of people you know you have to beat them with the truth
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:29.680]  because a lot of times people come against you when you're telling the
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:35.800]  truth your truth is your sword against them now their their their sword is you
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:38.880]  know based off what you're saying they're going to try to pervert it and
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:42.680]  turn it around everything that you're saying but you have to keep beating them
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:46.720]  in the face with the truth because that's what they run from yeah I don't care
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:51.320]  what anybody says just so you know that people say to me you know this one
[02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:55.000]  to say what do I care I don't care what they think how well we are with the
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.920]  motto of the Trends Research Institute is think for yourself we don't tell
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:04.560]  anybody what to think we just put the facts down and we give our analysis and
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:09.200]  and nobody tells me what to think if they disagree with the facts I'll debate
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:13.600]  them on that but you know we're again being a political atheist it's not
[02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:17.920]  what you wish what you want to what you hope for it's just what is and the what
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:23.080]  is now is that we believe that 20% of the people in this country that aren't
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:28.080]  suck ups are sold out could change the direction of this country it's a time
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:33.280]  for rejuvenation to bring back the best of what used to be and stop listening to
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:37.720]  all these people that can tell you what it could be if you keep following their
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:42.160]  course to disaster exactly Michael great points Jeff in Texas you're on the
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:48.320]  air with Gerald Salenty Jeff your your phone doesn't have its audio turned on
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:53.680]  I can hear you mumbling barely go ahead Jeff let's move on Kelly and Georgia
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:44:01.880]  Kelly you're on the air yes hi gentlemen um two things could you please speak a
[02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:08.400]  little bit about the future of IRAs 401ks and the like as far as whether you
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:13.360]  foresee any government takeover and also speak on some privacy issues what can we
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:20.440]  do to have some semblance of privacy in our personal and financial lives I'm a
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:25.320]  law-abiding citizen I don't do anything wrong but there's been instances that
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:30.360]  have been occurring with census people and it's becoming very they're
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:33.320]  training you that we're going to put you through naked body scanners we're
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:36.840]  going to come ask you questions we're going to set up checkpoints it's part
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:42.800]  of training you great points let's get Gerald Salenty's comments on what you
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:47.960]  asked well first off I don't do any online banking and I do is little online
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:52.160]  and in giving my private information out as possible and I think anybody that
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:57.360]  does online banking and gets hit you deserve what you get and that's number
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:02.880]  one number two it's like Alex said the more power they keep losing the more
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:07.120]  they put more rights they're going to continue to take away from us so everyone
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:12.040]  really has to become active at every level and again we believe that 20% of
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:16.000]  people could change the course because right now which we're following the 80
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:21.400]  dumbed down so it's that kind of thing from it and and and you when you go back
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.440]  to this whole thing about this body scanning at airports what brought it
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:32.160]  all about it was from some underwear bomber you know come on who is the guy
[02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:36.040]  that was touting this stuff on television that guy church
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:42.320]  jerk off to be the church where he pronounces name his name is jerk off yeah
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:48.320]  I was a former head of homeland security mr. Jerkoff yeah there he is he's the
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:53.680]  guy that was also a front for the for the company selling the machines I mean
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:57.000]  how could anybody be so stupid well they ordered him a year before the
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:01.560]  underwear bombing that I had the lawyer on who was on board the plane and it
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:05.800]  turned out everything he said was true the US government CIA ordered the
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:10.400]  State Department to let him on the plane it was all staged and it even came out
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:16.120]  mainstream news but but here's another question going along with what Kelly was
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:20.800]  asking you dealing with this what about Bloomberg two weeks ago admitting that
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:26.120]  every major insurance company is now tricking people and stealing the the
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:31.840]  widows of dead vets from Iraq and Afghanistan stealing 400,000 half a
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:36.440]  million a million dollar settlements and just keeping the money and they're so
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:40.440]  arrogant Bloomberg reported they send them a fake checkbook that's a trick
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:45.720]  when they sign it it signs away their money and it said prudential I mean it
[02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:50.160]  just shows you and then now they're announcing oh we're the government's
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:54.520]  ordering private pension funds to invest in failed banks so they're already
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:59.360]  stealing the money yes they are and and and on the question of will the
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:03.920]  government become involved in taking over pension funds etc. they're capable
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:09.680]  of doing anything and unfortunately I have to put money in IRAs because of
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:15.080]  tax purposes so so for my retirement program or else I wouldn't at all and
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:21.000]  and you know me I I don't believe in investing in stocks and I only invest
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:27.240]  in gold and different currencies and my currencies are only hedges against one
[02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:32.080]  going up and the other going down so I preserve my wealth we're gonna go to
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:36.120]  break in the final segment jam in calls from John Dan and Tony we may even get
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:39.600]  to one of them now but I want to roll some video well for prison planet dot
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:44.720]  TV viewers for radio I'll talk over it this is about two hours ago when Obama
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:51.040]  arrived in town and you see the dozens of motorcycles scores of vehicles the
[02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:58.080]  highway shut down for the emperor to arrive in Austin Texas and they've
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:02.800]  shot shut down much of downtown he's gonna be speaking a little bit after
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:08.040]  two at the UT Gregory gym at 2 p.m. there's a protest down there against him
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:11.200]  there's also some of his zombies who want a free lunch down there so I
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:14.800]  suggest folks head down there now he's always late so you'll be able to get
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:19.440]  there in time to protesting before and after when he leaves UT's Gregory gym
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:22.480]  but we launched another keyword today we've done that we've done this eight
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:25.800]  times every time we do it becomes the number one search term today we're
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:30.000]  searching his real name Barry Sataro and then when that'll become the number
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:33.320]  one search term hopefully in the next few hours then that will link them to the
[02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:37.920]  prison planet dot com article Barry Sataro aka Barack Obama's political
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:42.320]  dynasty crashes and burns Gerald is it good news that normally it takes two
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:45.800]  three years for people to wake up to a president being a puppet this time it
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:50.040]  happened in a matter of months and they had sold him as our messianic leader and
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:55.480]  now he's basically you know it's easier to sell you know dog do off the sidewalk
[02:48:55.480 --> 02:48:59.800]  to somebody than Obama does that not show the awakenings happening it shows
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:03.760]  the awakenings happening but anything can happen after that let's go back to
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:09.520]  George W. Bush remember how people looked at him in the polls before 9-11
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:14.160]  now he was the incompetent that people thought he was but all of a sudden he
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:19.240]  becomes the decider-in-chief creates this war on terror and people start
[02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:24.240]  believing this guy so anything can happen Alex if there's a terror strike and
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:28.680]  we believe there's going to be considering US foreign policy if there's a
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:33.360]  war you know it's not going to be as though the United States deserved it
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:37.880]  it's going to be look like another golf of Tonkin incident where it's fabricated
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:41.520]  and then we've got to get behind him and we've got to do everything he says
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:46.000]  government health care police state because he's our big daddy you got it
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:50.320]  and you're trying to say something interrupted no no that was it it they'll
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:55.680]  make it seem as though that they're protecting us and and that the people
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:50:01.120]  will rally around him they do it all the time and they know it these these
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:07.000]  manipulators in the White House are not stupid they're very shrewd and they
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:11.520]  know it will pull the people's hard strings if there's a another you know and as
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:16.520]  I said another terror strike an incident that don't this one won't be a golf of
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:23.240]  Tonkin strike it'll be a golf of Hormuz so it'll be that kind of thing well
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:27.120]  they're even bragging Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times and others saying
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:31.520]  he must have an Oklahoma City or 9-11 or he's politically destroyed he needs
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:35.440]  this to look strong well then who has the motive to stage the terror attack if
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:39.880]  they're admitting this will help them Gerald well a whether it's motivated or
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:46.240]  not it's certainly I will say this uncategorically it's instigated very

[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:27.520]  in Wyoming than Dan Tony and Tim John you're on the air go ahead thank you
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:32.360]  Alex I served in the submarine service during the Vietnam War and I'm wondering
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:37.080]  Gerald do you believe it was the North Koreans who torpedoed that South Korean
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:41.920]  patrol boat or was it one of our submarines who did that in order to try
[02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:47.160]  to precipitate a major war with North Korea one of the things that I've learned
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:52.640]  to do with it become very enjoyable for me is I start watching Russian TV and
[02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:57.000]  China TV you can get it on the cable channels and I was listening to a
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:05.320]  Chinese expert who categorically denied that that was a torpedoed from North
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:10.280]  Korea he said that he went on with the evidence there's nothing that they tell
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:14.120]  me that I would believe the one they show looks like a German torpedo and
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:18.320]  there was a drill going on with the US South Korean Japan when it happened
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:23.360]  that's part of it and the other one was that when it first happened and this is
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:28.440]  very important as a trend trackers tip when the story breaks jump on it right
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:33.600]  away and get all the global information you can because it was going on in South
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:40.520]  Korea the people were very angry because that ship had a lot of problems and they
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:46.440]  were complaining about the disrepair going on in the South Korea Navy that
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:52.400]  was the first report out from South Korea very interesting anything else John
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:57.520]  no sir you guys have a great day and of course another great show as usual Alex
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:00.960]  well thank you so much John Dan and Canada you're on the air with Gerald
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:07.320]  Salante Gerald dog if the view was wise enough to invite you on and they had the
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:12.240]  audacity to ask you about Wendy Lohan what would you say I wouldn't go on that
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:17.440]  show and I think it's a disgrace to the president of the United States to go on
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:23.440]  talk shows laugh ins or anything else I couldn't imagine a real commander in
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:31.720]  chief like like Eisenhower go on these shows and I stopped going on a lot of
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:37.360]  them because they're too stupid for me and they also tape you and then edit it
[02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:43.320]  that's the other one I won't go on any tape shows I'll only do live yeah I just
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:47.320]  said no to the history channel wanted me to do a big thing and I said no they

[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:40.160]  is probably the hottest issue that I can bring up in this meeting and that it's a
[02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:45.320]  town hall meeting that will open the eyes of my fellow citizens
