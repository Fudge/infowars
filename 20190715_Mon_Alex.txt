[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:18.000 --> 00:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump is breaking the hoax. He's breaking the trance of all these people of every race, color and creed being brought in from around the world and then being indoctrinated by the left to hate the United States and say that we're the worst country on earth as they fight to get in.
[00:47.000 --> 00:56.000]  Ilhan Omar came here fraudulently, married her brother, sucked off welfare, never had a real job, then cheated on her taxes. She's a scammer.
[00:56.000 --> 01:09.000]  And she constantly runs her mouth about how bad this country is and Trump came out and specifically called her out and said, you can't leave fast enough and the whole media has blown up at Trump.
[01:09.000 --> 01:20.000]  The control corporate media, good, let them, let them. You see, my friends, Trump's telling the truth and what he's saying is very, very, very popular.
[01:20.000 --> 01:31.000]  Yeah, they've got all these fake polls out saying every other Democrat will beat him in a race. You watch what happens on election night, November 8, 2020.
[01:31.000 --> 01:40.000]  If we get the vote out and stop election fraud, Trump's going to win in a landslide and all the real internal numbers show it. This is a huge broadcast, huge exclusive news coming up.
[01:40.000 --> 01:49.000]  But I want to air this Greg Reese report because it's so powerful, milkshakes to mull off radicalized leftist bonds go full blown terrorist.
[01:49.000 --> 01:58.000]  On Friday evening, hundreds of protesters overtook the flag polls outside the ICE facility in Aurora, Colorado.
[01:58.000 --> 02:09.000]  They raised a Mexican flag, an upside down American flag with abolished ICE spray painted on it, and an upside down Blue Lives Matter flag.
[02:09.000 --> 02:17.000]  Less than a day later, a man armed with a rifle threw incendiary devices at an ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington.
[02:17.000 --> 02:29.000]  A car in the parking lot was torched and investigators say the suspect threw flares at a propane tank, trying to make it explode. Ultimately, four officers opened fire, killing the man.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  The Democratic Party is running their platform on radical open border policies.
[02:34.000 --> 02:42.000]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  If the border goes, then our Constitution goes with it.
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.000]  Antifa has been using Molotov cocktails in Europe, and now the dangerous trend has officially arrived in the U.S.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  And the mainstream media supports them.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  They are strictly principled antifascists.
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.000]  It says it right in the name, Antifa, antifascism, which is what they were there fighting.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  I think that a lot of people recognize that when pushed, self-defense is a legitimate response to white supremacist and neo-Nazi violence.
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  When you go to cancer treatment, the radiation is tough treatment, but it is meant to remove the cancer.
[03:20.000 --> 03:32.000]  But who is really to blame? There are elected government officials who support Antifa and fill their minds with radical claims of a holocaust happening on our southern border.
[03:32.000 --> 03:41.000]  The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border, and that is exactly what they are.
[03:41.000 --> 03:50.000]  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, your colleague who was at the border with you, compared the facilities to a concentration camp.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Do you agree with that comparison?
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  Absolutely. I mean, there's a number of experts that say this is because it's traumatic.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  There are camps and people are being concentrated. This is very simple.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  I don't even know why this is a controversial thing for her to say.
[04:04.000 --> 04:12.000]  We have to really truthfully speak about what's taking place, and this is why it's really important for us to abolish ICE.
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  There is no plan in sight, and nobody is having the real conversation.
[04:17.000 --> 04:25.000]  Is there a natural limit to this kind of immigration? How many resources does America really have to share with the rest of the world?
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  Are we as rich as we assume we are? Are you?
[04:29.000 --> 04:37.000]  How many poor people can we realistically accept before we're not that rich at all, but increasingly resemble the countries from which these people are fleeing?
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  Now, it's possible there are good answers to these questions, logical answers.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  On the other hand, if there are answers, why is the left trying to prevent you from asking the questions?
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:51.000 --> 05:00.000]  Alright, strap yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen, because we've got a lot of exclusive intel straight ahead.
[05:22.000 --> 05:30.000]  Here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting Infowars.
[05:35.000 --> 05:44.000]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model,
[05:44.000 --> 05:53.000]  and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[05:53.000 --> 06:20.000]  This is the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[06:23.000 --> 06:52.000]  It's Monday, July 15, 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we are living in incredible times.
[06:52.000 --> 07:04.000]  A man, as you know, Saturday, firebombed an ice facility in Tacoma, Washington and tried to shoot the police, tried to blow up a giant propane tank,
[07:04.000 --> 07:13.000]  but if it would have detonated, it could have killed hundreds of people right through the wall on the other side. A huge tank. He was killed.
[07:13.000 --> 07:22.000]  Antifa is having celebrations all over Twitter and public demonstrations from Austin, Texas to Tacoma, Washington to New York City,
[07:22.000 --> 07:31.000]  calling him a soldier and a hero and saying, it's time to start killing. In his manifesto, he said, it's time to stop thinking.
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  It's time to get your weapons and to start killing police and ice.
[07:36.000 --> 07:48.000]  I've got his manifesto, I've got his quotes, I've got an inch of tweets by official Twitter accounts and Facebook accounts saying now start killing law enforcement.
[07:48.000 --> 07:55.000]  Walk up to police, shoot them in the back of the head, kill ice. We went out to demonstrations for illegal aliens.
[07:55.000 --> 08:08.000]  This weekend in Austin, they were wearing shirts showing the physical attack and killing of ice. This is very serious situation.
[08:08.000 --> 08:22.000]  And it turns out CNN actually did a fundraiser on national TV for the John Brown Gun Club, the militarized arm of Antifa and openly funded it.
[08:22.000 --> 08:36.000]  You cannot make this up. Here's the CNN show that specifically did it and did a fundraiser. W. Camus Bell, United Shades of America,
[08:36.000 --> 08:45.000]  fundraised one month ago for the group.
[08:45.000 --> 08:55.000]  We're going to be breaking it all down today. I was removed off of Twitter when they said that I said get battle rifles and attack the media.
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  They never showed a clip. They never showed a quote. They just said that.
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  They took out of a 38 minute live feed I did an emergency message to the president where I showed Antifa saying, we're going to come to congressman's houses.
[09:08.000 --> 09:16.000]  The life they did to the baseball field was a police. We're going to shoot Republicans. We're going to kill Republican police chiefs.
[09:16.000 --> 09:27.000]  We're going to come to members of the media's houses and kill them in actions way more violent than we did at Tucker Carlson's house.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  That was the week they did that.
[09:30.000 --> 09:38.000]  Lester Holt, everyone went on TV and said, Alex Jones just said in a shocking video, get battle rifles, kill the media.
[09:38.000 --> 09:49.000]  Statue of limitations is not up on that. And I can tell you that's one of the five suits we're set to file in the next month is against Lester Holt and NBC.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  These criminals know what they're doing.
[09:51.000 --> 10:02.000]  But you see, when I said have your battle rifles ready in place, Antifa comes to your house. If you're a conservative member of Congress, if you're a conservative governor, if you're in ICE, if you're in federal law enforcement,
[10:02.000 --> 10:11.000]  you should have your battle rifle ready because I have mine ready and we've had specific threats by Antifa that I haven't gotten to on air.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  And I've had around the clock former Blackwater folks at my house.
[10:16.000 --> 10:25.000]  It's been expensive. It's been fairly priced. But when I made those statements, it was because I'm actually dealing with this.
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  I'm going to stop there. I've actually moved because of it. And I'm going to stop there.
[10:32.000 --> 10:42.000]  But when I said that it was because these bastards, and they know full well who they are, they've got people inside the police departments, inside the FBI, you name it, they can dox anybody.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  Where I lived was not under my name.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  So when I said that, it was warning everyone to be prepared to defend yourselves.
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  And these monsters saw that as a threat because they're planning to come to your house. They've got a battle plan.
[10:58.000 --> 11:06.000]  Now, that's since come out mainstream news. Remember a month ago, ICE put out a intelligence report to the FBI saying we have confirmed and infiltrated Antifa groups.
[11:06.000 --> 11:16.000]  They are doxing ICE commanders homes and planning to come there and kill them.
[11:16.000 --> 11:33.000]  I told you all this because I'm experiencing it and I'm not a victim. I'm a target because I'm effective and I am a loyal American who loves my country and believes in a good open free society.
[11:33.000 --> 11:41.000]  And the globalists and the Chai comms are funding our collapse. They have funded thousands of caravans, tens of millions of people, hundreds of thousands a month they're catching.
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.000]  The border patrol is totally overwhelmed. It's an incredible job providing amazing security and care for these people.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  And the laws are wrong. So they're releasing 90% of these people.
[11:52.000 --> 12:05.000]  Then Ann Coulter gets in cheap shots about how they're not, you know, doing enough. Trump passed for 12 plus billion. He got a billion three. He just got four more billion. That's only half of what we need.
[12:05.000 --> 12:11.000]  It's a 635% increase in three years. We're under attack.
[12:11.000 --> 12:25.000]  And then you get people coming into this country like Ilhan Omar, bred and trained to hate this country, coming into conquer it from the most failed state in the world, Somalia, who believes it has a divine right to rule the world.
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.000]  By Somalia can't ever get its act together because everybody's a king. Everybody's royal. Everyone's a noble. Everyone has a right to rule.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  That's what I'm trying to take over Ethiopia and Sudan.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  Nobody wants to work. They don't want to just run around and be the boss.
[12:41.000 --> 12:50.000]  The genetics is pure arrogance, just like the Palestinians.
[12:50.000 --> 13:01.000]  And their sickening entitlement works with the leftist mindset perfectly. And she's here. I've got countless clips saying America's not good. It's terrible. She'll teach us how to be great.
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  I mean, these are some sickening clips, how it's concentration camp guards and they've got to be dealt with. They've got to be eliminated.
[13:07.000 --> 13:18.000]  And then it starts happening. You start trying to kill the border patrol as the nation's under attack, the most open border in the world.
[13:18.000 --> 13:33.000]  And Trump wades in perfectly knowing that there's already a fissure in the Democratic Party between Nancy Pelosi and the leftist. There was a perfect cartoon last week I meant to show you. See if you guys can pull it up.
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  I think Adon Salazar tweeted it. Salazar was on Adon's tweet, one of our writers. Yeah, it was Adon's.
[13:38.000 --> 13:54.000]  Where it shows Pelosi's paving this road to globalism, communism, world government. But the cement isn't dry yet. And here's Ilhan Omar and Tlaib and AOC, like little kids racing across the wet concrete, messing up the road.
[13:54.000 --> 14:07.000]  That's exactly, that's the perfect allegory, the perfect analogy. In fact, I even said last week that she's paving the road to the New World Order and then they're pissed at her, who's actually paving the road for them.
[14:07.000 --> 14:22.000]  So Trump sees this division, Trump sees this fissure, Trump sees what's happening, and he sees how America hating all these people are. So he comes out and he attacks Ilhan Omar and says you ought to go back to the country you came from in singular.
[14:22.000 --> 14:42.000]  And CNN, of course, to make a deception, said he called all four women foreigners, and so they should all four go back when he said you Congresswoman need to go back to the hellhole country, the worst in the world you came from, which is true.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  So Trump has made the right move and he's way ahead. Trump's 20 points ahead of everybody.
[14:53.000 --> 15:14.000]  Just as I told you three years ago on the election and they've got new polls. Trump trails Biden Warren Sanders in new NBC News, Wall Street Journal poll. So the weak minded still believe they're the majority and think, oh, he's losing. We're winning. Let's stay on the bandwagon.
[15:14.000 --> 15:27.000]  And you go to a Democrat event, an anti event. It looks like people that escaped from mental institution. You were driving down the road and you see somebody at a four way stop or at a street light and they're talking themselves looking crazy.
[15:27.000 --> 15:40.000]  They got the look. But all these people have the look of mental patients, but that's who they are. The truth is the Democrats engage in election fraud in every area they control their criminal group.
[15:40.000 --> 15:50.000]  The truth is the Democrats have about 30% support in voters. It's not 50. It's all rigged for them. No one likes them. Everyone hates them.
[15:50.000 --> 15:59.000]  Maybe 20% of the population nationally likes them and they're the biggest losers there are for their parasite controllers.
[15:59.000 --> 16:10.000]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S. What if I told you for just 54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract.
[16:10.000 --> 16:22.000]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart. Don't just take my word for it. Check out all of the success stories at HBXTrack.com or to order call 866-295-5305.
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.000]  866-295-5305. HBXTrack.com. Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:52.000 --> 17:10.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:10.000 --> 17:24.000]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:24.000 --> 17:36.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:36.000 --> 17:48.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:48.000 --> 18:08.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  That's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:30.000 --> 18:36.000]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:41.000 --> 18:50.000]  If they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[18:50.000 --> 18:58.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War, and even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:00.000 --> 19:15.000]  The globalists are hyper-competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.000]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[19:19.000 --> 19:31.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLive.com, I couldn't do it.
[19:31.000 --> 19:41.000]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottleman and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[19:41.000 --> 20:00.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere. It is amazing. Experience pure medical bottleman B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[20:12.000 --> 20:36.000]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host on this very important Monday, July 15, 2019, global broadcast. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[20:36.000 --> 20:48.000]  Now, coming up, we have a gentleman from the three percenters out in Washington who has actually been around and been confronted by the firebombing terrorist that attacked the ICE facility.
[20:48.000 --> 21:00.000]  He'll be joining us. Stuart Rhodes will be in studio, founder of Oath Keepers, breaking all this down. They actually had the manifesto before Jack Pasobic did. That's how on the job they are will be going over the manifesto.
[21:00.000 --> 21:10.000]  And I'm going to get back into Ilhan Omar and how smart it is, and how it's the right thing to do, to call the bluff of the left. Ilhan Omar is talking about how much America sucks, show her other cohorts.
[21:10.000 --> 21:19.000]  She came here fraudulently, married her brother, was on welfare the whole time, then engaged in tax fraud, which she admitted to and paid a fine for.
[21:19.000 --> 21:33.000]  The woman is a slug. She comes from a failed state. If you come here from Somalia and you embrace America, great, I embrace you. But I statistically have seen the numbers on many Somalis, and they say they want to go back to Somalia.
[21:33.000 --> 21:45.000]  America sucks. There's a lot of violence against other fellow Americans because they don't see this as their Islamic wonderland. They believe they are the superior master group to rule the earth.
[21:45.000 --> 21:58.000]  Well, go back and rule Somalia where you're constantly killing each other over control. Two types of civilization. Those that exist and those don't. One is based on Renaissance. The other is based on conquest.
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  Now, let's get right into it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:34.000]  Again, Info Wars is next year's news today. I was completely banned off of the major platforms a year ago, August 6th. I was 86th on 86th by all the big tech platforms because I was on air calling for criminal investigations of Google and Apple specifically for international spying, espionage and treason.
[22:34.000 --> 22:52.000]  In fact, there is the August 7th article in Real Clear Politics. Alex Jones and Donald Trump, you need to blow the whistle on Chinese Communist infiltration of Silicon Valley Democratic Party. In fact, let's grab that video.
[22:52.000 --> 23:03.000]  And I was on air for one month solid saying I don't care what happens to me. They're on the Chinese payroll, red alert, maximum alert.
[23:03.000 --> 23:10.000]  That is what we issued was a red alert pointing out that we exposed treasons. We were under attack.
[23:10.000 --> 23:22.000]  Peter Thiel spoke to a group of conservatives yesterday closed or transcript is available. It's at Fox News and Bloomberg and Axios.
[23:22.000 --> 23:35.000]  He said Peter Thiel says FBI CIA should probe Google. He goes on to say they shouldn't do it gently that they are under CHICOM control and that it's a well-known fact in Silicon Valley.
[23:35.000 --> 23:46.000]  They're actively working to bring down the U.S. Obama and Hillary authorized the deal eight years ago.
[23:46.000 --> 23:55.000]  Peter Thiel investigated Google for treason, aiding Chinese military, spies infiltrated. Now, that's a fact, by the way.
[23:55.000 --> 24:07.000]  And I've laid all the evidence out at Nausiems. You want to know why I got smashed first? It's called leadership, leadership.
[24:07.000 --> 24:17.000]  Everyone that we talked to that attended the conference on censorship in the White House Thursday said in full wars raise the alarm first.
[24:17.000 --> 24:30.000]  And that was the leadership. Well, the truth is that's not accurate. Matt Drudge raised the alarm first a decade ago and then four years ago in this studio standing right there off camera.
[24:30.000 --> 24:41.000]  And it is about credit because we need to give people credit that are trailblazers and have the will to hit the bar bar first and take the attacks that you see above ground and below ground.
[24:41.000 --> 24:51.000]  Because believe me, for any attack you see on the surface, it's real fun behind the scenes. But you know what? It is fun because we're going to expose the globalists trying to bring in authoritarianism.
[24:51.000 --> 24:58.000]  It always looks like evil is going to win until good people stand up and then it reverses. And we're in that reversal period right now.
[24:58.000 --> 25:14.000]  But I specifically, in the weeks leading up every day, hammered Google and Apple. And I laid out how they moved to China, how they gave all their codes to it, how they officially put their main servers there and the Apple code keys.
[25:14.000 --> 25:22.000]  So of course, Tim Cook at Apple and the heads of Google all got together and said, we got to shut this son of a bitch up. Guess what?
[25:22.000 --> 25:40.000]  I sat in my living room with my father a month before and I said, father, I have had a vision and my vision and mathematical and key algorithm Schumann system where I said, I'm going to press the attack and call for their arrest.
[25:40.000 --> 25:51.000]  And they're going to ban me. And out of that, we will be at the fulcrum point to have even more influence with real thinkers as we go into this because I envision total bannings within a year of everybody else.
[25:51.000 --> 26:00.000]  Why shouldn't I just be first up front? He said, if you think you know what you're doing, execute. And I executed. And it's all unfolding as we have foreseen it.
[26:00.000 --> 26:11.000]  Now, I say that not as some weird metaphysical thing. Our brains are powerful. And when you've built systems and worked hard, and at the heart of the resistance, you're able to then understand the future.
[26:11.000 --> 26:21.000]  And if you become a history's actor and you get involved and engaged, nothing can stop you. This Republic is back from the dead on its feet in a fight for its life.
[26:21.000 --> 26:34.000]  Now, here we are confronting the puppet head of Google under alphabet Sundar. Just what six, seven, eight months ago, letting him know he bet on the wrong country.
[26:34.000 --> 26:41.000]  And now his arrogance is drained away to fear.
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  And again, a horse, a horse, a kingdom for my horse. We kind of went through this eight, nine months ago, and it all happened. It was like five different camera angles.
[27:12.000 --> 27:27.000]  Way down the hall, he comes in. And as he comes down the hall, I say, you bet on the wrong country, Sundar, and you're going down for your treason with the dragonfly project.
[27:27.000 --> 27:40.000]  And by the end of the day, I'm going to have that full clip for you. It was shot from five different cameras. It's very powerful. And we're going to have that. In fact, here's a clip from an earlier piece we have where I point out the treason.
[27:40.000 --> 27:50.000]  We're aware of his lying to Congress. We're aware of him in the dragonfly project that's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government. Now it's just being rolled out to general public.
[27:50.000 --> 27:58.000]  There is an absolute all out war on conservative free speech.
[28:20.000 --> 28:28.000]  This guy is a threat to the Republic.
[28:28.000 --> 28:36.000]  British anti-Islamization activist Tommy Robinson has had his Twitter account suspended again after he tweeted that Islam promotes killing.
[28:36.000 --> 28:47.000]  Also Twitter purged various libertarian accounts. Instagram temporarily banned Tommy Robinson. Facebook took down a GOP candidates ads for allegedly being offensive.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  The FCC is cracking down on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  They're coming for everyone's speech. It's criminal.
[28:54.000 --> 29:20.000]  Social media accounts are being banned, blocked and canceled on Twitter.
[29:20.000 --> 29:41.000]  10,000s of people's lives across America.

[30:00.000 --> 30:11.000]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[30:11.000 --> 30:18.000]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change.
[30:18.000 --> 30:25.000]  And how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[30:25.000 --> 30:34.000]  The system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[30:34.000 --> 30:41.000]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  Robert Barnes, what does Big Tech become?
[32:02.000 --> 32:11.000]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[32:11.000 --> 32:19.000]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.000]  have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change.
[32:24.000 --> 32:34.000]  And they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[32:34.000 --> 32:44.000]  The infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[32:44.000 --> 32:51.000]  Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[32:54.000 --> 33:00.000]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[33:00.000 --> 33:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.000 --> 33:19.000]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[33:19.000 --> 33:32.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:32.000 --> 33:43.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:43.000 --> 33:49.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have the raw clip. I was just mentioning of where I confronted the head of Google in Congress.
[33:49.000 --> 33:54.000]  Then we're going to go to our guest with breaking news on the firebombing attack.
[33:54.000 --> 34:03.000]  We also have a real clear politics video from a year ago where I said that Google and Apple should be investigated for espionage for the Communist Chinese.
[34:03.000 --> 34:14.000]  Now, Peter Thiel says FBI CIA should probe Google. They basically already have moved to China and worked for China and were involved in election meddling inside the United States.
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  Now, the Democrats can say they can violate free speech. Okay, can they work for the Communist Chinese?
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  How about coming illegally spy on the American people?
[34:23.000 --> 34:30.000]  So, again, I didn't just make this stuff up. They've moved to China. They've given them your Apple code keys.
[34:30.000 --> 34:37.000]  They've given them the keys to the cloud. This country was signed over by Obama to the Chicoms, but it's all coming to a head.
[34:37.000 --> 34:43.000]  Here I am confronting the head of Google, telling him he bet on the wrong country and is a traitor.
[34:43.000 --> 35:03.000]  Sundar, you know Google is helping China with dragon flying. You know that they're helping censor and you know who told this country out.
[35:03.000 --> 35:11.000]  Sundar, you're engaged in treason. You've had Google executives lie to Congress that you're not censoring conservatives. Sundar, you will not silence the people.
[35:11.000 --> 35:21.000]  Your censorship will not work anymore, Sundar. We're aware of your activities trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your search results.
[35:21.000 --> 35:34.000]  Google is evil. Google is evil. Google is evil. Google is evil. Google is evil. Google is evil. Google is evil.
[35:34.000 --> 35:49.000]  Google is going to lie again and violate the law and violate the law.
[35:49.000 --> 35:55.000]  You're in a public hallway. You're going to be arrested. That's enough. You're making too much noise.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  So Google's not evil, though, officer?
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  I'm not saying that. Just control yourself.
[35:59.000 --> 36:00.000]  Okay.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  Get under control now.
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  I'm under control, officer. Thank you.
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  He's taking my free speech away and lied about me, so I need to stand up now.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  I'm not worried about that right now.
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  They're going to talk about me in this committee. They're going to talk about me in this committee. I will be talked about.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  So what am I supposed to do? I don't get a day in court.
[36:14.000 --> 36:21.000]  And I was talked about. Okay. Let's go to the real clear politics clip from the day after I was banned off the Internet.
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.000]  Last year where I said it's China controlling Google and Apple, they must be criminally investigated.
[36:26.000 --> 36:33.000]  Now they talked about the highest level national conservative conference with Peter Thiel and Trump and everybody else.
[36:33.000 --> 36:42.000]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, you know about it when I'm getting banned or shadow banned because I'll make a big deal about it.
[36:42.000 --> 36:50.000]  Matt Gates was shadow banned and we told him two weeks before Roger Stone told him on the phone and in text messages.
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  We've run you through their system.
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.000]  We have sites that look at this. We're sending links. You're already 90% banned on Twitter.
[36:57.000 --> 37:03.000]  Gates went up during the committee hearing and said, you're a private company. You can do whatever you want, not even getting it.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  So the next day they shadow banned him 99%.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  They go, this guy's an idiot. We all just lied to him and said, we don't censor any conservatives.
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  He said, that's fine. Just don't talk about killing congressmen.
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  And the next day they banned him down to nothing. Then he said he felt victimized and I'm not trying to put Matt Gates down.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  Just come on, man. Get it together. Figure out what's going on.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.000]  Mainstream corporate media is fake news. They're the enemy of the American people, like the president said.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  And now they're coming after everybody.
[37:34.000 --> 37:40.000]  Now, if you want to get into the real reason all this is happening, I know it's demoralizing.
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  I don't want to demoralize people, but facts are facts like having cancer. It's operable. We can fix it, Mr. President.
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.000]  You know the Office of Personnel Management was done by insiders. That's even come out in intelligence reports.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  They try to keep it quiet because it's such treason. It's unbelievable.
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  We know China owns the majority of our debt after the private fellow reserve.
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.000]  We know they now own Hollywood. You've helped block some of them buying up American Bandstand, a few final things they didn't own.
[38:02.000 --> 38:11.000]  We know that they're teaching Maoism in the colleges and all 50 major state-funded colleges have major Chai-Com infiltration.
[38:11.000 --> 38:17.000]  Some of them are run by the Chai-Coms, even the Washington Post had to admit.
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.000]  We know that the People's Army of China has been caught running Dian Feinstein's operation.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  We know their penetration is hundreds of times that of the Russians.
[38:25.000 --> 38:33.000]  We know they're involved in election meddling, and we're so arrogant they went to Davos a year and a half ago and said they would stop your agenda along with Yunker.
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  Mr. President, America knows you're real.
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  They know the Democrats are the anti-American globalist ally of the Chai-Coms, radical Islam, the unelected EU, and others.
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.000]  If you come out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue and them trying to steal the election,
[38:47.000 --> 38:55.000]  and if you make the fact we need an internet bill of rights and antitrust busting on these companies, if they don't back off right now,
[38:55.000 --> 39:03.000]  and if you don't come out and point out that the Communist Chinese have penetrated and infiltrated and are way, way worse than the Russians because it's true,
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  and the Democrats are scared of that coming out, and you've got the Feinstein info coming out, and more is about to come out,
[39:09.000 --> 39:16.000]  just as I've told everybody, than they will be able to steal the midterms and start the impeachment.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  It's the right thing to do, Mr. President.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  It's the truth, and it's crazy to believe it.
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.000]  It's crazy to understand it.
[39:23.000 --> 39:32.000]  I know you've been told this from our technology to the South China Sea to everything to them having 98% of rare earth minerals.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  They didn't do that by themselves.
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  They were given that.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  David Rockefeller said he was going to move over to China.
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.000]  They said they were going to do all this, and now you've stepped in, the country's coming back from the dead.
[39:43.000 --> 39:49.000]  They're desperate to stop it, and they're trying to stop you and every American from having their speech by defaming me,
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  lying about what I've done, Soros financing fake lawsuits to give it legitimacy,
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  and now de-platforming me ahead of it because the lawsuits are all getting thrown out because their lies,
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  90% of what's in these things are total frauds,
[40:03.000 --> 40:09.000]  and they know we're getting stronger, and they know we're moving forward, and they now have made the wrong move.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  I believe they've jumped the shark.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  I believe they've won the battle, but they're going to lose the war if you, with your vision,
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  continue to take action and make free speech, and this internet antitrust garbage,
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  the number one issue, and move against them now.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  If you don't, they are going to steal the midterms.
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  They're already doing it with economic contributions of the Democrats, blocking everybody else's speech,
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  that supports America and making it great again, and your agenda.
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.000]  So I knew they were planning to ban everybody, so I decided to just go right after Apple and Google moving to China,
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  knowing they banned me completely because I was calling for criminal prosecution of them.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  They took the bait.
[40:47.000 --> 40:53.000]  Alex Jones and Donald Trump, you need to blow the whistle on Chinese Communist infiltration of Silicon Valley Democratic Party.
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  Then I went to their meetings in Congress, confronted them face to face, and it happened.
[40:58.000 --> 41:07.000]  The Pentagon, the CIA now understands, and very soon Google and YouTube, its subsidiary and Alphabet,
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  and Twitter and Facebook reportedly will be back in our hands.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  If they're not back in our hands, the globalists are going to win.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  We built it. We constructed it. It's been hijacked by Obama and the Chai comms.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  It's time to take it back.
[41:18.000 --> 41:24.000]  Now, we're going to go to both our guests, one via Skype, one no introduction, Stuart Rhodes here in studio.
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  Matt Marshall is the state leader of the Washington 3% community.
[41:28.000 --> 41:35.000]  He's an awesome guy, and we're going to be talking to the combat veteran and patriot who's had to deal with the John Brown Gun Club,
[41:35.000 --> 41:42.000]  a leftist terrorist organization, I guess the SS arm of Antifa, and he knew.
[41:42.000 --> 41:48.000]  He'd run into the moron Patsy that firebombed and tried to kill the police,
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  tried to, I guess, burn people up inside the ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  That's all coming up on the other side.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  Briefly, we won't be here without your support.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  Hey, Ilhan Omar, nothing against Somalia, but you don't have space shuttles over there.
[42:00.000 --> 42:07.000]  We've got the Space Force red, white, and blue designer shirt, 1776.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  The shirt costs us like 14 bucks to produce.
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.000]  The really high quality made in America, the printing, the red, white, and blue American flag.
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  Similar shirts are sold for 40, 50 bucks at the mall, but they don't have infowars.com on them.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  This is for 1776 to get the word out.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  Our 1776 Worldwide Special has to end tomorrow because supplies are very low, a bunch of the best supplements.
[42:29.000 --> 42:39.000]  75 is 25% off store-wide at infowarsstore.com, 1776 on oral apparel, and a bunch of the other best-selling supplements are 1776 as well.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  Get your Ultra 12, the best B12 out there for 1776 as well.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  Whatever you do, be part of the Second American Revolution.
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  Funding us is just as important in a war as producing bullets and food for the troops.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  Without you, we don't roll.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  When you support us, we will cross the enemy together.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  Stay with us.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it stinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements.
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.000]  In that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.000]  I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were,
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  and I'd have doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good.
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down.
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[43:30.000 --> 43:38.000]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.000]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.000]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.

[44:23.000 --> 44:28.000]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  And I want you to know that love is right back at you.
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.000]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  Because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun.
[44:42.000 --> 44:43.000]  But that's not what's important.
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  The enemy could win.
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  We're being used by God.
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  You're being used by God.
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.000]  This is Providence, so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.

[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud and the free.

[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  Full power of the republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  Full power!
[46:55.000 --> 47:03.000]  All the torpedoes go straight at them.
[47:03.000 --> 47:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.000 --> 47:21.000]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show.
[47:21.000 --> 47:29.000]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[47:29.000 --> 47:39.000]  Arping on wars, we fight and griping about the way things are being.
[47:39.000 --> 47:45.000]  William Van Spronsen believed he was liberating a Nazi death camp.
[47:45.000 --> 47:54.000]  Spokane, Washington was really thousands of people trying to get into the U.S., most of not political exiles, but still 90% would just be released into the country.
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  We had the most open border system in the world.
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.000]  Instead, he burned up cars, tried to blow up a giant propane tank, tried to burn the building down that would have killed people if he was successful, possibly.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  He was killed by the police officers that responded.
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, a patriot veteran constitutional lawyer, is riding shotgun with us.
[48:11.000 --> 48:20.000]  He called us up yesterday, I appreciate him doing that, to tell us about Matt Marshall, who is a state leader in Washington, the 3%ers.
[48:20.000 --> 48:30.000]  He is also a combat veteran, vice chairman of the second legislative district, Republicans in Washington, second amendment advocate, currently running for Eatonville School Board.
[48:30.000 --> 48:48.000]  And he is WA3% Washington3%.org and Matt4ESD.com. And Stuart, you're the expert on this, along with Matt, introduce this, how he knows this John Brown Gun Club and Antifa has actually been menaced by them.
[48:48.000 --> 49:00.000]  Matt has held multiple free speech and open carry rallies in Washington state, and that's where he ran into Vance Bronson. And Matt's also an airborne veteran, by the way, a second airborne.
[49:00.000 --> 49:07.000]  So Matt, tell us about your interactions in the past with the John Brown Gun Club and Vance Bronson.
[49:07.000 --> 49:18.000]  So, our history with John Brown dates back to our first political rally we had. It was called Liberty or Death, and it was against left-wing political violence.
[49:18.000 --> 49:25.000]  And John Brown was there across the street, we didn't know much about him at the time, and we didn't interact with him.
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.000]  But what we did find was we were being called Nazis and white supremacists, all kinds of things that were just completely untrue.
[49:32.000 --> 49:42.000]  And when we left this rally, our bus was attacked. We had the windows broken out, we were pepper sprayed. We got out, nobody was hurt, but we had some property damage.
[49:42.000 --> 49:48.000]  Oh, I remember when that happened. What's that? I remember hearing about that when that happened.
[49:48.000 --> 50:00.000]  Yeah, it was pretty ironic that we're out there, the ones being smeared by the media, and they're the ones actually attacking our bus when we're protesting against political violence.
[50:00.000 --> 50:07.000]  By the way, while you're talking guys, show some of our articles and show this guy and the John Brown Gun Club. I want to show people some of these guys. Please continue.
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  So, you met this person in particular, right? You met him face to face.
[50:11.000 --> 50:30.000]  Between the two rallies, when they were smearing us as white supremacists, white nationalists, we reached out to them just to show that it was absolutely untrue and actually opened a dialogue with some of their leadership just to try to settle the score that we're not what they're claiming we are.
[50:30.000 --> 50:42.000]  And it culminated with at our December 1st rally, where it was rally against left-wing media bias. We actually invited them across the street from Antifa to come across and let's have an open dialogue.
[50:42.000 --> 51:00.000]  And that's where I actually, first, the only time, met Spronson. And what I remember about him was, first off, they wanted to continue to push the white nationalism idea as well as communism.
[51:00.000 --> 51:18.000]  And that right there is a picture of one of my guys, Huffleberry, talking to Spronson. So, he was pushing communism. I remember that he did the debate actually culminated with us saying that in order to institute the ideals of communism,
[51:18.000 --> 51:28.000]  he would have to resort to violence to enforce the communistic ideals upon the people. And he thought it was absolutely untrue and could be done peacefully.
[51:28.000 --> 51:35.000]  Well, that's amazing because Karl Marx and Lenin and all of them say any means necessary and that it's going to take a violent struggle.
[51:35.000 --> 51:42.000]  You have to overthrow and kill up to a third of the population to ever implement that. That's Mao Zedong. That's Marx. That's Lenin. That's all of them.
[51:42.000 --> 51:48.000]  Yes, dictatorship of the proletariat is part of Marx's core theory, which he must have a dictatorship that would then wither away eventually.
[51:48.000 --> 51:55.000]  I think some of these anarcho-cap communists simply believe they can just jump ahead of that and not have a dictatorship of the proletariat.
[51:55.000 --> 52:06.000]  So, they're, in a way, useful idiots. Was this guy, Ben Spronson, do you think he was one of those types of thought that can get away with skipping the dictatorship of the proletariat?
[52:06.000 --> 52:13.000]  I think at one point he probably was there, but I mean, anybody who's read his manifesto, you can tell he was frustrated.
[52:13.000 --> 52:21.000]  I really do believe that he was trying to incite more violence down the road. I don't think he was targeting any people during his attack.
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  I think he was going more after property, but it was clear that it was a suicide mission just based on his letter that he left.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  Well, exactly. He said, I want to be a martyr and I'm going to go do this.
[52:30.000 --> 52:38.000]  And so he pointed guns at him, reportedly fired without learning, but not even so much at the police, tried to blow up the propane tank, burn up some cars.
[52:38.000 --> 52:45.000]  And he said, stop thinking, just take action, get ghost guns and start killing. And his main target is law enforcement.
[52:45.000 --> 52:55.000]  And he sincerely believes that he's fighting Nazis. As I've said before, what gets the sad thing is a lot of these people are going to die fighting guys like Matt and I,
[52:55.000 --> 53:03.000]  who are both well-trained paratroopers who actually know how to use violence. They're going to fight and die believing that they're being killed by Nazis
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.000]  when they're just being killed by American veterans who are trying to preserve our country.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  And you've been predicting this for a while. That's going to go kinetic.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  Absolutely. For at least over a year, two years actually.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  So they turned to the modern version of the weather underground.
[53:15.000 --> 53:22.000]  You actually said three years ago in that studio, we're affecting the future of battle state, battle space. They're going to attack.
[53:22.000 --> 53:28.000]  They can't stop. It's their communist agenda. Three years ago, you said it was going to end in this right before Trump even got elected.
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  Yeah, absolutely. And so what Antifa really is now is future Cheka.
[53:32.000 --> 53:37.000]  They're going to be the secret police of the communist dictatorship who go and kill people.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.000]  This is what they're already talking about doing now because they believe we're all Nazis.
[53:42.000 --> 53:47.000]  And so for us, we're in a sad and frustrating position. I'm sure Matt will agree.
[53:47.000 --> 53:57.000]  We just wish they would understand that we're not actually Nazis and they're being manipulated and controlled by the elites who want to use them as cannon fodder.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  Matt, what are your thoughts on that?
[53:59.000 --> 54:07.000]  I mean, it's extremely hurtful to a lot of our minority members, a lot of our Jewish members.
[54:07.000 --> 54:14.000]  We have a pretty prominent Second Amendment advocate, Aria Rode, who comes and speaks to a lot of my rallies.
[54:14.000 --> 54:19.000]  And his grandfather was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany.
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  And so it's very hurtful to their entire family when they're labeled as Nazis.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  And it's completely untrue.
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.000]  But you have to understand, to these leftists, if you don't accept paying for five-year-olds to have their genitals cut off,
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  because he talks about that being the great right, is to be a trans person,
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  if you're not into whatever CNN says or MSNBC says, you're a Nazi.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  A Nazi doesn't mean you work for Hitler and invade Europe and millions have to die to defeat him.
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  Being a Nazi means not doing what they say.
[54:49.000 --> 54:56.000]  Well, it's even worse than that. Not being a Nazi to them means you must be for the destruction of the United States as a nation state.
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  Exactly.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  This is where the anarcho-communist community...
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  That's the litmus test. Get rid of the borders.
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  Yes.
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  Open everything up, flood it. Communism.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  Right. Like you said, the chant is, you know, no border, no wall, no USA at all.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  That's why they tear the flag down. That's why they fly the Mexican flag and yell out, you know,
[55:11.000 --> 55:19.000]  give a little rasa. They really believe sincerely that the only way to have freedom in the world is to destroy the United States as a nation state,
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  destroy our Constitution, kill all the police, and then take over and they'll have this, you know, miraculous utopia.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  And by the way, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I want to explain to them,
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  it's not like we're China that never had freedom and then got taken over by communists.
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.000]  There's no way with the dug-in American people that any of this is ever going to fly.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  They're all going to get killed, which we don't even want to do.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  I mean, let me ask you, both as veterans and both smart guys, you're an award-winning constitutional lawyer,
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  one like the big, was it Yale Award or whatever.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  Let me ask you this to it and we'll go back to your buddy here.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  How do you see this ending if they keep going down this road?
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  Civil War. We were already in a Cold Civil War. Bernstein, the ancient reporter said we were in a Cold Civil War.
[55:56.000 --> 56:02.000]  He's actually correct. The problem is, is that they're being used and manipulated to force them to fight us
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.000]  and then we'll have no choice but to fight them back and defend ourselves and defend our families and defend our country.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  And they'll be exterminated.
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.000]  And like I said, they'll die believing they're fighting Nazis all the way to the very end.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  That's what's so sick and disgusting about it.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  Well, I just hope their controllers know this.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  You think we're just going to fight with your cannon fodder?
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  They really kicked this thing off. The people pulling the strings will be hunted down.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  So Matt, what's the mindset of you and your brother veterans there in the Northwest about this?
[56:29.000 --> 56:37.000]  About this situation? Yeah, we think it is clearly part of the spark.
[56:37.000 --> 56:42.000]  I think that they're trying to push it over the edge and elicit a response.
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.000]  I think that's what they were expecting when we showed up in Tacoma at the ICE detention facility yesterday.
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  I think they were expecting that we were going to be there to antagonize.
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.000]  But what they don't realize is none of us want a fight.
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.000]  If they bring it to us, we'll defend ourselves. We'll defend our communities. That's what we do.
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  But there's no way that we're just going to go out there and be the aggressor.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  And I think that's what they're trying to provoke.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  What happened yesterday?
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  By the way, I should have opened the interview up if you guys were out there guarding the flag before this, then after it.
[57:12.000 --> 57:16.000]  I mean, you know these groups well. And so you can actually tell them what really happened.
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.000]  We're going to go to break when we come back. Lay all this out for us.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  We've got Matt Marshall. He's ahead of the 3% group in Washington.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  Again, we'll also define when we come back what the 3% are.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  We're folks that don't know. Couldn't think of a more patriotic group.
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  I'm not about 3%ers. It's got to be at least 15 years.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  I don't know who even started it. I just know that Mike Vanderbilt.
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  A lot of great folks out there.
[57:37.000 --> 57:42.000]  So that's Stuart Rhodes here with the Oathkeepers. Matt Marshall with 3%ers.
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.000]  WA for Washington, 3%.org. Be sure to check it out. We'll be right back.
[57:47.000 --> 57:52.000]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom,
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage.
[57:57.000 --> 58:03.000]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.000]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything
[58:08.000 --> 58:13.000]  for what they know is right and what they know is true.
[58:13.000 --> 58:19.000]  As long as we stay true to our codes, as long as we remember our great history,
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.000]  as long as we never, ever stop fighting for a better future,
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  then there will be nothing that America cannot do.
[58:29.000 --> 58:36.000]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square.
[58:36.000 --> 58:41.000]  The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  that's available to the public.
[58:43.000 --> 58:46.000]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[58:46.000 --> 58:50.000]  Full power of the republic in the name of Jesus Christ. Full power!
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.000]  Damn the torpedoes, go straight at him.
[58:53.000 --> 58:58.000]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square.
[58:58.000 --> 59:03.000]  It's the network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[59:03.000 --> 59:07.000]  That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  It is completely independent of all that.
[59:09.000 --> 59:16.000]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech.
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  That, in fact, the founders were so concerned with, at the beginning of the country,
[59:19.000 --> 59:23.000]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this,
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[59:25.000 --> 59:30.000]  We now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[59:30.000 --> 59:36.000]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the person's allowed to have or express or hear.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  And the Infowars audience has broken through that.
[59:38.000 --> 59:43.000]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[59:43.000 --> 59:47.000]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the blackwarming defamation,
[59:47.000 --> 59:50.000]  lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[59:50.000 --> 59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Alright, I want to get into the fact that the three percenters in Washington
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  have been dealing with this huge bloom of the John Brown Gun Club.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Hell, they were here in Austin marching last year saying,
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  we're going to kill the police and just all the police are Nazis and fascism.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  And people don't know who the John Brown Gun Club is.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  People might want to get into that, but just in this short segment,
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  next segment coming up, Matt Marshall, head of the three percenters in Washington,
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  we'll get into the specifics of these groups and what actually happened out of this ICE facility that you've been at
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  and been guarding the flag yet. It's all really important stuff.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  But spend a few minutes on your awakening, who founded the three percenters,
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  what it's based on. Define three percenters for us and tell us your story.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  I mean, three percenters really represents the three percent of American colonists
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  that stood up to overthrow the British in the Revolutionary War.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  Our organization at least, the Washington three percent is an independent one.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  There's various national chapters, but we're an independent veterans nonprofit.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  We work for community preparedness, community support,
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  and we needed to do community defense.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  We're currently pending 501c4 status with IRS and that's been,
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  we're well overdue when we should have heard back, but no surprise to anybody there.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  Really what we do is we've been trying to bring awareness across our state
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  as to what the left is doing to all of us as far as trying to censor the media.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Infiltrating the schools, trying to educate the youth by indoctrination.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  They're grabbing guns as fast as they can with billionaire funded initiatives in Washington state.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  I mean, we had what four billionaires fund an entire initiative that was bought and paid for.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  It was unconstitutional for both the U.S. and Washington state constitution.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  We just got jammed down our throats and we've been trying to oppose it.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  What made you finally take action as a veteran family guy?
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  I mean, what triggered you to get politically involved?
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  So I watched what happened both at the Bundy Ranch in Mollier and I was active duty during both of those.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  And just seeing how the Hammons were treated, seeing how the Bundy's were treated,
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  and just watching the government trample rights, I just was waiting for my time,
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  waiting to get out of the military so that I could take action.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  So as soon as I got out, I jumped into one of the national 3% organizations
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  and realized that they weren't taking as much action as I was happy with.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  And so we started our own Washington state independent group.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  Well, that's beautiful. Briefly, Stuart, because you knew the original founder of the 3%ers.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Tell us about the 3%ers for a minute.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Well, Senator Bo, I believe, was back in 2008 and he had been an ex-communist actually back in the 60s.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  He was young and dumb. He had been a communist.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  But thankfully, he was rescued from that idiocy by a guy who worked with
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  who taught him about American history. He had not been taught.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  And so Mike became a very strong anti-communist.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  If you want the real people's fight, this is it.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Exactly. And also a very strong anti-racist.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Make fun of the white nationalists and neo-Nazis to no end. And one of his core planks of being a 3%ers
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  is you respect the Constitution and the rights of all Americans, regardless of race.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  That's why it's so particularly disgusting to have the left try to paint 3%ers or oath keepers.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  I'm a 3%er myself to try to paint us as being white nationalists.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  That's their only strategy. That's their core strategy is to use identity politics
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  and divide people along racial lines and condemn this country as inherently evil and racist.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  But unfortunately, it's working. And so Mike fought against that.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  I wish he was still around, frankly.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  But what Mike did, which I think was kind of smart,
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  is that he didn't found an official organization.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  He just put it out there as a concept.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  And so you wind up with lots of independent groups like Matt's that are all over the place
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  and they're hard.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  And that's what you've done. It's what employers have done. It's an idea.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  Right. So it's hard to crush a concept and an idea like that.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  So, you know, hats off to Mike Vanderbilt. He's now passed away.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  But it lives on.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  It lives on exactly through guys like Matt.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  Beautiful.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  We're going to go to break. We're going to get in.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Instead of me asking a bunch of questions, the specifics of this, what's unfolding
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  and what we can expect from Antifa next.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  And Trump finally taken the gloves off to people like Ilhan Omar,
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  who runs this country down constantly just saying, listen, you don't like it.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Get the hell out.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  I never play a song twice in the same show,
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  but I think we should come back and play the fight inside of me one more time.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  Stay with us for the right back.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  This is a very organic non GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  There has never been a more important time to support info wars.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help order now at the info war store.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot blend coffee
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  delivered right to your door at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  Harping on wars, be fighting, griping about the way things are to be.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  When they're running down my country, man, they're walking on the fight inside of me.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  Yeah, walking on the fight inside of me.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  You don't love it. Leave it.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  If you don't love it, leave it. Let this song I'm singing.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  Trump is finally, and after our guest leaves us the bottom of the hour, we'll get into how big this is.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  Invoke, if you don't love it, leave it.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  Ilhan, you came here as a refugee. We gave you free welfare.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  You never worked a day in your life. You ran scams, tax scams.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  And now you're going to tell us, I don't know if you saw our speech, that she'll teach us how America can be better.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  I mean, Trump is right. They've already split the Democratic Party.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  This is the Democratic Party's real agenda, but they're bringing it out too early.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Trump is really smart to press the attack on this lady.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  We'll talk about it coming up and your guests can pop in as well.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  But Matt Marshall, the head of the 3%ers in Washington, your warning folks, and you were saying this days ago,
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  now it's all over the news, that they're calling this guy a martyr.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  He was calling for more violence.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  The Facebook and Twitter are, I'm going to show some of the tweets while you're talking, are letting them promote going out and trying to kill more police, more ICE people.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  That was the flavor of what we saw in Austin this weekend.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  Oh, and short shot video, they wore shirts that show the attack and killing of ICE members, CNN actually raised money for this group.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  So combat veteran, Matt Marshall, go ahead and get into your warning and you know this group.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  You met the latest, you know, a crazy guy that just got killed and being at the epicenter of this and Washington State, what do you think's coming next?
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  Well, we watched right after the killing happened before the Spronson was even identified.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  We watched Antifa making comments like we need to murder him.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  We need to take this as a way to further our cause and our agenda.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  And we really see it as being the next spark.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  We were very concerned in the wake of that shooting that they already had a planned protest across the country, all the ICE facilities.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  We really expected something to happen there and decided that we needed to have a presence.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  We had discussed it for about 24 hours had actually only seven of our members that were available within an hour to get down there.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  Once people started to gather and they're outnumbered, you know, close to 10 to one and group of Antifa, just like they were trying to do across the country, started walking over towards the flag.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  Our guys recognized it, then they went running over there and just intercepted it, stood in front of the flag and sat there and guarded it for the entire protest.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  They didn't say a word, they were very friendly, they were very peaceful, they were just, very matter of fact, you will not take down our flag.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  And again, people say, oh, let them take it down, but it's more than symbolic.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  It's an act showing, in fact, try to cue that up and roll that footage of Aurora, Colorado, where an ICE facility, it's not even really, most of them aren't even Mexican or Hispanic.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  It's a bunch of white liberals pulling down the American flag, running up a Mexican flag and going, whoa!
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  In fact, let's roll that audio for people.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  American flag taken down, Mexican flag run up, then they desecrate the American flag, run it up.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  These people are insane, they all want to get in here out of Mexico, but look, those are all white people.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  I mean, the left is really a grip of mentally ill, self-hating people, both your takes on that.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  Matt Marshall of 3% and founder of Elk Keepers here at Stewart Roads.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  Go ahead, Matt.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  Okay, so, I mean, it's very personal for a lot of us, especially as veterans or just people who love this country,
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  who have literally been overseas and risked our lives for this flag, seeing friends of ours come home under the flag.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  If you know the history of the flagpole and the truck on the top,
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  I mean, if you're being overrun, you're supposed to take the flag down, separate the stars from the stripes,
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  light the flag on fire and there's a bullet in the truck and you're supposed to kill yourself so you can never surrender to the enemy.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Yet, we're sitting back right now and there's people across the country just willingly watching them take the American flag down.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  These are citizens. This is an act of treason.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  They're denouncing their U.S. citizenship by removing the American flag and taking it down on U.S. soil to run up a foreign country's flag.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  And they know it's a military action because these are communists.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Yeah, this is what you do when you take over territory. You rip down the flag.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  When you conquer a fort, for example, you tear down the flag of the enemy and you raise your flag to cheers.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  This is exactly what they were doing.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  And Matt said, this is not simply, you know, it's not even free speech.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  This is a flag that belonged to the detention facility there.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  They desecrated it, ripped it down and then strung it back up.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  I look at it, as you said, as an act of treason and as an act of war and we need to stand against it.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  So I'm calling on all veterans out there in particular but also all patriots to go stand at your localized facility and stand up for your flag and also stand against terrorism.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  You're being assaulted, our country's being assaulted by a communist coup.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And we need to symbolically let them know we're not putting up with it because here's the key, folks.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  We're being probed. This is all over the U.S. It all happens the same day, the same way.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  It's all being programmed by Soros, Alexander Soros. We got the documents last year.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  They are orchestrating all this through stay-behind networks that Obama has inside U.S. agencies.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  And they're really testing and they're really probing what we're going to put up with.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Yeah, that's right. It's a probe. It's to see if you don't react to it, if you don't defend the flag, if you don't stand up and support ISIS with boots on the ground,
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  they're going to see that, it's going to embolden them.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  They're going to see that as your weakness and they're going to keep going.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  And there's also another claim. Oh, you're just cherry-picking people that say America was never great.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  It'll never be great. Governor of New York. You're just cherry-picking congresswomen saying arrest people that criticize Democrats.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  No, they're all saying it. They are un-ploking. They are an authoritarian, foreign-funded, globalist group.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  We have cancer, folks. The average leftist literally gets nauseous if you say America is great.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  And I was never even an America file. I love America. I care about it, but I'm like, oh, this is overdoing the flag and stuff.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  No, I get it now. There's people that hate it. They're trying to remove it. That's why you've got to defend it.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  So you've got to either totally choose it or totally be against it because they're making their move right now, Matt.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  What do you think about just the culture of the left now is officially America-hating?
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  Well, it's because the majority is staying silent. I mean, the far-left liberal is really not the majority, but they own all of the media outlets.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  I mean, John Brown Gun Club just got a special on CNN called the United Shades where they're glorified as peaceful defenders of their community.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  Yet, we can't get 10 seconds on mainstream media when we are out there actually fighting for rights and draw crowds of 1,000 at the Olympia Capitol standing against unconstitutional gun laws.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  Well, they just discount all these Americans as Nazis. And as you said, American Shades is the one raising money for the terror group that just attacked.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Absolutely. And we're sitting here just, you know, in shock that, you know, it's from the schools to the media, every form of media, like they just own it and control it.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  And then you got places like Portland where the police won't go out and enforce the laws. So then you got Antifa running wild.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  And then that's put all over the liberal media as normal. It's just inspiring people to do more of the same.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  And let's be clear. On the universities in the think tanks, they've been breeding this for 50 years.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Hillary was supposed to come in. They were going to launch it. Well, Trump got in. They said, screw it. Launch it with Trump in.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  So you're seeing this is their attempted takeover. This is their assault.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  Yeah. Imagine if Hillary had won. You'd be seeing this, the same exact pattern be happening, but it'd be done with the full support of the White House.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  The only thing keeping them in check right now is Trump, who's not doing what he should be doing.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  He should be nationalizing, for example, the National Guard of Oregon should have been federalized and put on the streets of Portland to keep the peace.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  When the mayor openly lets them go out and attack people and split their heads. And see, that's the thing.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  He still gets off balance listening to his advisors that are scared of MSM. The MSM's hated everything. Ignore them. No one listens to them.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  We have the initiative and we're on the right. If we take action, we can't be stopped.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Yeah, do what you should be doing. When they desegregated the schools in Little Right, they brought in the U.S. military.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Eisenhower didn't play games. He sent troops in.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  Right, exactly. And so he should federalize the Oregon National Guard, put them on the streets of Portland for one example among many,
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  and secure the peace of the American people in their right to free speech and assembly.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  If he doesn't do that, though, guys like Matt and I have to go do it ourselves. And Joe Biggs.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  That's why Joe Biggs is heading to Portland on August 17th.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  There's going to be a collision course there between Antifa and veterans on August 17th, because President Trump is not doing what he should be doing, frankly.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  Now, let's talk about what Trump should do with Matt Marshall, three percenters, and Stuart Rhodes.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Of course, the both keepers. I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.

[1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:04.880]  Info Wars, the most banned network in the world. So the Info Wars model is a self-fulfilling,
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:09.920]  self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together
[1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:14.880]  and supporting one another and sustaining one another. It is the only independent press of this
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:21.120]  size and scale of this public reach. It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting,
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:26.480]  self-sustaining, self-structured, little d-democratic structure that because the audience determines
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:31.040]  what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:34.880]  and supporting Info Wars. And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:39.680]  it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete
[1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:44.400]  with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press,
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:49.200]  support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views
[1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:53.760]  they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is
[1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:56.720]  the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[1:19:56.720 --> 1:20:07.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:30.240]  Well, all over the country the Soros funded Antifa is praising the man that tried to blow up the
[1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:35.920]  ice facility and burned up some cars, was shooting at police, it was killed. We've got Matt Marshall
[1:20:35.920 --> 1:20:41.200]  who ran into him and knew this crazy and Stuart Rhodes, of course, both keepers Matt Marshall
[1:20:41.200 --> 1:20:45.280]  heads up three percenters in Washington state. After he leaves this next segment, I'm going to
[1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:50.560]  get into Trump's calling out of Ilhan Omar saying, just get the hell out of the country,
[1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:55.120]  suck so bad. Don't come here and arrogantly tell us that you're going to teach us how to be Americans.
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:21:00.000]  She actually said that in a video Sunday. We're going to play it coming up. But Matt,
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:04.640]  you were telling us during the break that Antifa is buzzing around like a beehive in Washington,
[1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:10.000]  and just just beside themselves saying rest in power. This guy is the example of the future.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:14.560]  Do what he did. He said he hopes people start killing random law enforcement. I mean,
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:21.120]  these people are crazy. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, there were sightings in Olympia yesterday with
[1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:26.800]  banners hanging off the back of pickup trucks that say rest in power. Comrade Spronson,
[1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:30.800]  like just glorifying him like what they're trying to murder him. That's what they're doing.
[1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:41.280]  Sorry. At the ice facility, they had a memorial that set up for him out where he was shot.
[1:21:42.320 --> 1:21:46.480]  Yeah, I saw that. Let's pull that up with lots of people playing guitar. I mean,
[1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:50.560]  these people are such villains, and they think they're the good guys.
[1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:56.320]  No, they've been brainwashed to hate their own country and want us to mize, and you can't talk
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:02.080]  them out of it. Unfortunately, they sincerely believe that this nation is inherently from its
[1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:07.120]  founding was inherently evil and racist and imperialistic, and the only way to tone for
[1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:12.240]  their sins is to destroy their own country. Matt, I don't mean this mean, but I've been
[1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:17.280]  to a lot of Antifa events. I've been to a lot of Lepus events. When you see a mentally ill person
[1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:21.440]  or somebody that has a chromosomal problem or a disorder, you can tell they have a disorder
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:27.520]  and disagree or agree. But when I look at these videos and I look at the photos that we just
[1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:32.240]  showed of them, how they're celebrating this would be killer, he looks like a mental patient.
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:36.880]  They look like they're mentally ill. It seems like something's wrong with them.
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:41.840]  A, do you agree with that? And B, how would you categorize your average Antifa person?
[1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:46.560]  So the average Antifa, I just don't think, thinks for themselves. They're part of the
[1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:52.720]  group sync mentality. I mean, just little things like they stand across the street from us and hold
[1:22:52.720 --> 1:22:58.240]  a sign that says, kill Nazis and the cops who protect them. And then they turn around at yesterday's
[1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:06.240]  event and go and tattle on the seven guys that were open carrying legal pistols to the police
[1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:11.360]  because they're armed. The police response was, yeah, we see them, your point. I mean, police
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:15.520]  didn't care. Exactly. They're like, we're going to have guns. Don't follow gun laws. He says,
[1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:19.120]  kill people with illegal guns. You're legal with guns. They go tattle on you.
[1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:25.680]  Exactly. And it's the same thing. They tried to label in me as a misogynist somehow,
[1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:30.880]  that a wife and three daughters yet somehow a misogynist. And so to protest me apparently
[1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:36.640]  hating women, they stood across the street dressed up as a giant vagina. That was,
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:42.640]  that was how they were going to represent women. So you're a smart guy, Stuart. Try to profile
[1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:46.800]  these people in two minutes. I mean, who are they? Well, what you're seeing, what you're seeing
[1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:52.160]  there are the, I should call them the bottom feeders or the lowest level. But I mean, I went to
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:57.120]  Yale Law School. A lot of my classmates were self-avowed, proud communists. So you can't
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:01.280]  presume that they're all just, you know, dumb people. That's not true. It's a mistake to think
[1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:05.760]  that you're seeing the street soldiers, the ones who are more likely to go out there and stand
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:09.920]  around all night holding up signs. The useful idiots. Right. The useful idiots. But I want
[1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:15.600]  to talk about, I want to belong. I finally do. The professor commands me. But they're not,
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:21.680]  but they're not, this is not a fringe element. This is deep inside of academia. The majority of
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:26.880]  the students on colleges and campuses now will self-identify as socialists, which really means
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:32.160]  Marxist and communist. And their professors are. Sure. So this is, this is the weaponized
[1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:36.800]  authoritarian university shooting tentacles out. Oh yeah. Look at the average Bernie supporter.
[1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:42.240]  The average Bernie supporter is really a Marxist. They're a hardcore communist. They mass themselves,
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:47.200]  calling themselves democratic socialists. But their whole agenda is Marxism. It's communism.
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:51.840]  And it's a ticking time bomb because they're being conditioned to believe that now they must
[1:24:51.840 --> 1:24:56.480]  go kinetic. They must fight back because it's now or never these are concentration camps
[1:24:56.480 --> 1:25:01.200]  that must be liberated. They see themselves as the U.S. soldiers hitting the beach of Normandy
[1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:05.120]  to go fight the Nazis. And they don't really realize they're actually the Nazis behind the
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:09.120]  machine. And they're funded by a former Nazi. So Matt, other points you want to make as we've
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:13.920]  been jumping in, Stuart and I are never lost for words. You're a smart guy. Have you been able
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:18.000]  to ever turn one of these guys back to reality? Cause we try to talk to them. None of them talk
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:21.920]  because they're in such a cult. They're told you don't talk. Only the leader, the local professor
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:25.680]  in the mask tells them what to do. Have you ever been able to get through to one of these guys
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:32.640]  on the street? No, never on the street. Now behind the scenes of some of their leadership,
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:38.160]  I've been able to have a civil conversation where we agree on nothing, but at least have a two-way
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:42.320]  conversation on the street. They'll shut you down immediately because they know that we
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:48.320]  know what we're talking about and they don't. And so they immediately say that we're being
[1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:53.840]  aggressive by just saying, why do you think I'm a Nazi? Like that told that at Washington State
[1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:58.240]  University. I said, why do you think that I'm a Nazi? Why do you think that I hate immigrants?
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:05.280]  And they said, you're being aggressive. Please get out of here. And like you said, they go block
[1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:09.040]  our free speech. They physically attack us. You go to a public event, they come block you and say
[1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:17.920]  you're disrupting and make you leave. It's like a death of logic. Let's put that photo back on
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:23.360]  screen. This is a group of arrested antifa. Now look at them. I'm not being mean. They all look
[1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:30.080]  like they have had lobotomies and they all have this weird look wimpiness, but they also are
[1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:36.000]  real craze. They're very dangerous. It's like psychotic nerds or something. It's like, it's a
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:44.880]  weird phenomenon. What would you call this, Matt? Oh, I don't know. A hodgepodge of people that
[1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:48.160]  needed to be hugged more when they're children. No, I think that's what I said the other day.
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:52.480]  A lot of leftists leave kids in cribs, don't take care of them. Babies aren't held. They
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:57.600]  don't get real breast milk. They are little, needy weirdos who actually think they're victims and then
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:02.000]  an evil six them on us. And I don't think they get. I'm not trying to be Mr. Tough guy. I've never
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:06.480]  been in the military, but I'm a great shot them on stuff. You look at these kind of guys. How long
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:14.000]  would this group of people in combat with veterans last? Seconds, maybe minutes depending on the
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:18.640]  circumstances. But these are the bottom level ones. These are the ones they push out in front
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:22.720]  to be arrested. They're the decoys. There's other evil like Hezbollah,
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:28.560]  MS 13. We know work for the Democrats. They're behind the scenes. Yeah. You've got more dangerous
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:32.720]  elements in the John Brown Gun Club is a good example of that. More dangerous elements that do
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:37.200]  contain some veterans that are holding back and are waiting to go. Tell us about those in closing,
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:42.000]  Matt Marshall. Oh, absolutely. They know what they're doing with firearms, the John Brown Gun
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:46.880]  Club. They're well trained. They post their range days on YouTube like other Patriot organizations
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:51.280]  do. They talk about building their own AR rifles. The difference is, as a Patriot organization,
[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:56.400]  we try at least to follow the laws that at least make sense. And they had complete disregard for
[1:27:56.400 --> 1:28:01.760]  all laws. So this guy was a felon and didn't have the right to own a firearm. So they showed him how
[1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:06.800]  and he built a AR 15 that he used for his attack. Whereas we just don't keep those people around.
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:15.200]  But they're very dangerous. The other thing is so are we. We're very dangerous if we need to be.
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:20.160]  We're very calculated, though, and very well tempered. So you're not going to be able to
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:24.240]  provoke a response from us. And the problem is they don't realize that when they do provoke the
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:29.600]  response, they're really not going to like the end result. Yeah, I mean, I anybody try with a
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:34.880]  firearm and take like 20 of them out in seconds. It's not going to be pretty unbelievable. Well,
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:39.600]  Matt Marshall, as this unfolds, please be our liaison reporter out there in Washington. I
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:45.520]  bless you. W a 3% dot org. You're running for school board, which is really important, Matt, for

[1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:13.440]  $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff. We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price and we're
[1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:18.000]  moving a ton of it. Okay, but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:22.240]  $20,000 that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew. So we need
[1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:26.560]  to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product. I want to expand that contract
[1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:31.040]  and for six months, we've not been able to stand still. The enemy's been winning and I have labored
[1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:35.520]  and labored and labored and labored on this. I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like
[1:30:35.520 --> 1:30:39.200]  to be fighting and we are winning the info war. That's why we're so hated, but we need to be
[1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:43.360]  retreaded. We need to be tuned up. We need to be fixed up. We never have time to get into drive up.
[1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:48.560]  We got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us. Then they're really going
[1:30:48.560 --> 1:30:52.000]  to plant child porn on us. Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else. I mean, the
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:55.760]  Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks and the chai
[1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:02.480]  com show go to info war store.com. As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in
[1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:08.880]  recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil
[1:31:08.880 --> 1:31:16.400]  war. Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change
[1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:22.800]  and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system
[1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:29.920]  fails. The system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores
[1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:36.480]  could be empty in three days. Having storeable foods and the ability to purify water will give
[1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:42.400]  you a fighting chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes
[1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:49.600]  you a slave to a dying system. Buy storeable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today.

[1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:04.080]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control
[1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:08.160]  freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own
[1:32:08.160 --> 1:32:13.680]  decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. Now we're fighting them
[1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:17.840]  hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension. But one of the
[1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:22.560]  biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:28.160]  is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com I couldn't
[1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:33.520]  do it. That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:41.120]  medical bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the
[1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:46.000]  strongest highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere. It is amazing
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:51.200]  experience pure medical bottom and B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution
[1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:58.000]  against the tyrants at info wars store.com in 4slife.com or AAA 253 3139.
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:15.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:35.200]  From the front lines. Oh yes, we are the front lines of the information war from the front
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:39.520]  lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:45.040]  Right and wrong.
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:56.080]  Stuart Rhodes founder of keepers award-winning constitutional lawyer as well back when he
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:34:00.160]  was still having time to practice law is here with us and I want to cover the waterfront while
[1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:04.480]  he's still with us for the next 30 minutes. The hell you want to go longer you can host the third
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:10.480]  hour with us. I'm going to open the phones up for first time callers and I've worked towards
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:14.720]  this but I'm really going to do this now where we give the number out and we take like five calls
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:18.160]  and I go to those we open the number up again we take five because we have a phone system that
[1:34:18.160 --> 1:34:23.360]  takes like 30 at a time and we get like 30 calls on there that ever get to half of them. So I'm
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:27.760]  not doing that anymore we get callers on we get to them they're gone because I respect you and I
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:31.840]  don't want to leave you on hold but there's no way to get to 30 callers in two hours. So we're
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:35.840]  going to have a system where we take first time callers for a while and where we go to five of
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:41.600]  them clear the board take five more clear the board that's coming up next hour. I'm not trying
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:47.600]  to toot my horn but I'm very very excited right now about Peter teal at the big conservative
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:52.560]  conference saying Google and Apple are working for the chai comms the chai comms are working with
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:57.280]  the left over to the country that's what's happening and we exposed that it's game over
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:02.880]  they're beaten instead of having a huge civil war and all this crap let's just be smart tell Americans
[1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:07.760]  hey foreign powers manipulated our openness with the globalist they thought they'd do this Obama
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.560]  and Hillary thought they'd be in power still they're not let's just say no to it that's so huge
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:17.600]  we'll talk about that was to her roads we'll talk about Trump I think a genius idea be politically
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:23.680]  incorrect go back to what makes sense you wouldn't go to Somalia as a refugee get elected there they
[1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:29.120]  never elect you they don't even have elections and then talk about how Somalia sucks they'd kill
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:34.880]  you instead Trump just says hey lady go you married your brother go back you came here fraudulently
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:41.200]  in fact I told crew last week I'm gonna do a White House petition where we call for Ilhan Omar
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:45.520]  to be investigated for fraudulently coming here marrying her brother have her strid citizenship
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:51.360]  stripped and have her ass shipped back to Somalia where she'll be executed for wearing lipstick and
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:56.160]  by the way I'm not for that I'm just saying hey baby you said you're gonna teach us how to be good
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:03.280]  folks and I shadow get your ass stoned to death so we don't want you to die sweetheart we just
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:10.080]  don't want to live under your Sharia so that's coming up but first ladies and gentlemen the one
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:14.560]  big way they can shut us down is either put a bullet in my head or and we still keep operating
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:19.120]  actually that meant me a martyr the best way they know is to financially shut us down I'm gonna
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:28.000]  make it easy for you okay we have great coffee we have great fish oil we have great new tropics
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:36.160]  we have so many other great products at info wars life dot com we have so many products at
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:41.760]  info wars store dot com that are already the highest rated and that people need you need
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:45.360]  fluoride free toothpaste four to five a little silver and iodine it's great for your body the
[1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:50.640]  best toothpaste out there from our research you need x2 and x3 the good halogen of the body
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:56.640]  learn about the iodine conspiracy you need turmeric you know my wife this morning she has hip pain
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:01.920]  from playing tennis it's competitively another stuff for decades she said you know it's funny
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:07.760]  this turmeric that says it's three times stronger doesn't have the same effect as your bodies
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:13.200]  but your body says it's a lower milligram of turmeric and I explained to her I said honey
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:19.120]  that's because this is a patented turmeric extract but under FDA rules you can't even it's an extract
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:23.920]  you have to call it turmeric because we're under basically food law and it gets into complex stuff
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:31.120]  but I said that's why ours is 95 percent curcuminoid and so the average raw turmeric's maybe five
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:35.920]  percent when it's concentrated the best brands are 80 percent we went out and found the highest
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:41.360]  you can get 95 percent curcuminoid and so you look at you go well that's weaker than other
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:45.680]  turmerics well that's because the bottle would cost me 40 bucks a bottle if it had the same
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:51.280]  milligram amount as raw turmeric it's not raw turmeric it's cold pressed patented concentrated
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:57.520]  turmeric extract with several other things from other nature to help boost it bodies is the
[1:37:57.520 --> 1:38:04.240]  strongest turmeric you're going to find anywhere ladies and gentlemen that is 50 plus percent off

[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:21.840]  important is for listeners to understand we don't have George Soros of the big mega banks of the
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:27.440]  fortune 500 funding us we're only funded by we the people absolutely and so with Oath Keepers we
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:31.520]  need we need you guys to join and you don't need your prior service if your prior service
[1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:36.480]  military law enforcement of course by all means join but if you're not so you can still join we

[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:01.520]  like the three percenters did in washington state we're posting up outside of ice centers
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:06.320]  to defend the flag and also to defend against terrorism so we need your support and we encourage
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:11.360]  you to come join and come step in and by the way the the infiltration i never gotten big because
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:15.760]  the infiltration the way you've kept a clean ship at Oath Keepers how the hell did you do that
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:20.160]  well we have good people we have guys that are that are level-headed prior service military
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:25.520]  law enforcement who come in and you know by and large so you know who over areas to put in charge
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:30.560]  to where yeah we put good people in charge and you know from the bottom up they're all they're
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:36.160]  all self-regulating they take care of themselves and they they purge out the the hotheads or the plants
[1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:41.840]  and boy they're plants aren't they oh of course yeah i mean we saw during the the whole bunny stand
[1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:47.360]  off in in uh in oregon what 10 12 of them were were actually paid informants so we expect it
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:52.560]  we're not doing anything illegal and so as matt was saying we stay up we stay above board
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:57.280]  and comply with our laws in our states and we keep things clean and they can't do anything about
[1:40:57.280 --> 1:41:01.120]  that they can't they can't stop us from doing things we do i mean it really is true the conservative
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:05.680]  christian nationals movement are a bunch of voice counts and it doesn't mean that we don't know about
[1:41:05.680 --> 1:41:11.200]  we don't want to be corrupt we i mean we we love being good decent people well sure most
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:14.720]  most law abiding american citizens this is this is what the left plays against you though
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:18.400]  is that they know that we will stick to the letter to law and follow the law while they
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:22.480]  break everything they break all the rules make all the laws thunder knows the constitution
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:26.480]  thunder knows that federal law for example on immigration and they just run but don't they get
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:31.120]  once the venera civilization pills back what's gonna really happen i don't think they do i think
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:35.440]  they have normalcy bias of their own they they look at us and they say they see people that they
[1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:40.000]  think you know like guys our age will dismiss as boomers right but they'll say you know these are
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:44.480]  people who are weak and won't do anything they don't understand that that we're the tip of a huge
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:48.720]  iceberg of americans who are still going about their daily business trying to make a living for
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:53.760]  their families and they're busy they're busy that's why they want you and i and others taken out
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:58.720]  is they know we're command and control but i got to tell the enemy something it's beyond our control
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:04.000]  the america's so awake and so amazing if stewart and i were gone tomorrow this thing is still rolls
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  on that's that's correct so you've got rank and file veterans out there for example who are going
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:16.320]  about their lives who are well trained a lot of combat vets and if this kicks off into a civil war
[1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:21.200]  a bloody one they will instantly go to work and organize their local communities and take it to
[1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:25.840]  the left and left will be stomped problem let's be clear and we don't have to give orders our people
[1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:30.800]  are all smart they're not going to target method anifa civil war starts the leadership the democratic
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:36.880]  party is not going to be a nice place among others right i mean they really ought to be
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:42.240]  be surrendering right now but the danger as you said is china that's the real danger for us though
[1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:48.880]  let's talk about that when we come back and let's get into trump's great move going after aoc going
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:53.920]  after illan omar and saying just get out you traitor you enemy instead of bowing and always
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:43:02.960]  powering to these people we will always be the people who defeated a tyrant cross the cotton
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:11.200]  army of science took to the skies and soared into the heavens because we will never forget
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:15.920]  that we are americans and the future belongs to us
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:29.040]  the future belongs to the brave the strong the proud and the free we are one people chasing
[1:43:29.040 --> 1:43:38.880]  one dream and one magnificent destiny we all share the same heroes the same home the same heart
[1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:48.240]  and we are all made by the same almighty god info wars dot com tomorrow's news today full power
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:53.600]  the republic in the name of jesus christ full power damn the torpedoes go straight at him
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:55.600]  um
[1:43:57.680 --> 1:44:01.840]  robert barnes what does big tech become a big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:05.840]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:10.240]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:14.160]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:17.600]  members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real social
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:21.840]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:25.760]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:30.080]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:34.880]  recover after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:39.920]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:44.240]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:48.640]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:52.320]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:56.800]  form of gas lady what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:03.200]  i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're
[1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:07.040]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before
[1:45:07.040 --> 1:45:11.040]  all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:14.720]  products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to
[1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:18.800]  explain why they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support
[1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:21.840]  us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they
[1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:25.520]  know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:32.320]  jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996
[1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:36.960]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:41.440]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[1:45:41.440 --> 1:45:45.200]  is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things
[1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:49.120]  and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:54.720]  doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info war store dot com or triple eight
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:46:04.480]  two five three three one three nine info wars the most banned network in the world viewers
[1:46:04.480 --> 1:46:09.600]  and listeners i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:14.160]  as you've seen but i wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:18.560]  how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week the worst things you
[1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:22.560]  can say about people that you knew they were liars you went and looked it up and found out the truth
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:27.840]  and so i feel very strong and i feel god's hand on my shoulder and i feel your love in my heart i
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:31.840]  want you know that love is right back at you and i want to thank you for all you've done with your

[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:41.200]  end but i want to win and without you i'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun but
[1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:46.240]  that's not what's important the enemy could win we're a key chess piece in this fight we're being
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:50.880]  used by god you're being used by god this is providence so i salute you and i thank you for
[1:46:50.880 --> 1:46:57.440]  all you've done from the bottom of my heart info wars the most banned network in the world
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:03.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:15.120]  oh
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:25.120]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:37.280]  you know ladies and gentlemen it blows me away to see apple and google openly
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:42.560]  moved to china and openly involved in espionage had to be the first to raise the alarm and to
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:48.800]  actually see our government waking up and finally taking action our government's not perfect but
[1:47:48.800 --> 1:47:53.760]  compared to the chai cons they're the good guys as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said
[1:47:53.760 --> 1:48:02.320]  this year in herrings uh when senators brought up the point that that that apple is actually
[1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:07.040]  in google are working with china against the united states and you were saying before the break
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:11.200]  steward roves of oathkeepers that that really is the central issues we talk about
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:16.160]  the left and all this in hollywood but it it really is chinese now well sure that's a great
[1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:21.600]  danger if america unfortunately were to devolve into a civil war i think a big concern we would
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:26.480]  have is what would the chinese do they'd make their south china sea move absolutely well not
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:30.720]  just that they would also make a move on the west coast the united states frankly you know that sounds
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:34.720]  kind of crazy to say that but that's that's what their ideology would take what all of them do
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:37.680]  this comes support for the the communists inside the united states well they're already
[1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:42.800]  funding the confucius groups when i was covering antifa we infiltrated them like six years ago
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:47.360]  when nobody was talking about them they were following malice events and going to confucius
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:52.480]  groups and ut professors were there running antifa so like you said this is high level
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:58.000]  that's why antifa is so protective well i mean they're they're the tip of the spear for the radical
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:02.800]  left and the radical left believes that they're about to fulfill you know with taylor's election
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:08.400]  they're about to fulfill their their their uh long march the institutions to make this country
[1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:12.720]  into a communist state but then trump threw a monkey wrench in those plans and like you said
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:16.480]  before that's why they've amped up they've they freaked out and said we got to push forward our
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:21.600]  agenda and you know crash the system with it with a cloud pivot strategy that's what they're doing
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:27.280]  right now so the real question is will it kick off before after the election frankly if it's almost
[1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:34.400]  like 1860 all over again if the left loses the election they'll go insane and and spark a revolution
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:39.840]  if they win the election they'll go crazy and try to crush us with with state power so either way
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:43.040]  well yeah and a lot of folks in the political right will not accept the results of the election
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:46.240]  either but consider the results be illegitimate because they know that they're going to use massive
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:51.040]  vote fraud so i don't think we're going to be able to avoid it either way one way or the other i
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:55.040]  believe we're heading for a civil war the only way to possibly shortchange that is if trump
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:59.600]  seals the border with the troops and then goes after the election fraud issue no i agree if we
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:04.080]  don't have massive action now it's going to be 10 times worse and you know how i know you're right
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:11.360]  not just intellectually not just historically not just economically gut level my gut says my body
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:17.520]  is like literally go train with guns get ready to fight buy a place in the country get food like my
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:22.720]  gut's never wrong my gut is protect your family it's too late get out and the fact that my gut is
[1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:28.400]  screaming evacuate evacuate tells me you know that fatherly side of me that motherly side is like
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:33.440]  protect your children and that tells me that some big stuff's coming yeah you need to get ready for
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:37.040]  it i mean as you've been pushing and i've been pushing for years you've got to have your food
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:41.440]  storage down you got to have fuel you've got to have your weapons and you've got to have a network
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:47.360]  of close family or friends so your gut doing the same thing like absolutely yeah i mean i'm not
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:52.320]  sure it's avoidable there's very we have a small window left for a peaceful solution but trump has
[1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:56.880]  got to act in decisive manner as commander in chief he's got to suppress the radical left
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:01.920]  while securing our borders he can't underestimate how crazy they are no you can't and but here's
[1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:07.280]  the thing is that like i said before their whole game plan now is to steal the election with massive
[1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:11.120]  voter fraud that's the whole point of them bringing all these people in is they're going to be future
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:16.720]  democrat voters and and they've got the scan databases of dead people just in california
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:20.400]  they had to take millions off the voter roll they admitted we're voting illegally the names of dead
[1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:25.600]  people two weeks ago that got no coverage judicial watch right all confirmed they won their lawsuit
[1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:30.400]  proved millions oh well it was like a million three illegal voters in california alone that's a
[1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:34.400]  drop in the bucket this is what's kind of frustrating right now so the ice race today and
[1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:39.920]  started yesterday are going to go after about 2000 people well 2000 come in almost every day
[1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:45.040]  if not more than that yeah it's more than that 158 000 a month they catch yeah so so while while
[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:48.960]  trump's focused on that they're bringing in even more and more and more that's why you must use the
[1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:53.520]  military to seal the border and it's very frustrating for me i wonder why he hasn't done that yet
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:58.560]  and all these states now have legalized giving voter IDs you illegals and they're saying let
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:02.400]  them vote i mean it's here yeah and then and they're taking the mask off they're letting you know
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:07.440]  openly i mean omar herself nothing was uh cortez said that these are her constituents that the
[1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:11.680]  illegal aliens are her constituents so they're doing it right in your face and of course if you
[1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:17.200]  point at that toe camp is campaigning in mexico sure yeah that's why they're going down there
[1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:20.960]  that those are their actual constituents their new constituency the losing black and hispanic
[1:52:20.960 --> 1:52:25.840]  americans actual u.s citizens are walking away and so they're replacing the numbers show that
[1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:29.200]  you're not just saying it double the number of hispanics and blacks supporting trump
[1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:33.200]  so they're just panicking then try to break the gates exactly so this is this is claire pivot
[1:52:33.200 --> 1:52:39.760]  all the way so can we survive their death rows um only if trump acts decisively as far as avoiding
[1:52:39.760 --> 1:52:44.560]  conflict the only way to do it peacefully is he must lock the border down and he must go after the
[1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:48.720]  the election for us you know i've always been anti-police state but police state just means
[1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:52.960]  authoritarians to control the police that's why i'm now like control the border arrest people
[1:52:52.960 --> 1:52:57.520]  calling for violence because if we don't it's gonna be 50 times worse well it'll be the end of the
[1:52:57.520 --> 1:53:01.200]  united states as a country that's their goal you know that's why they chant you know no borders no
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:05.920]  wall no usa at all their goal is to destroy the united states as a country and then rule over it
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:10.960]  as an oligarchy and these lazy asses won't know how to run the reactors they we could barely run the
[1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:16.720]  country as it is they think civilization is like this easy thing to run well the leftist elites
[1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:22.000]  will run it but they'll run it the same way you see venus in venezuela or in cuba there'll be a small
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:28.320]  oligarchy of marxist leaders at the very top who then lord over a bunch of serfs that's the goal
[1:53:28.320 --> 1:53:32.880]  that's it right i can't believe how clear-cut it is i can't believe how how do they convert
[1:53:32.880 --> 1:53:38.000]  where the democrats always disabled how or did they how we know they weren't how do they convert
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:44.480]  the average democrat to be such a crazed mindless demon in college the universities were dominated
[1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:48.800]  by marxists and still are and they're being brainwashed in college and then now it's all the way
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:52.960]  down to the elementary school as you pointed out many times they're indoctrinating the children
[1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:58.480]  through through elementary school onward to hate the country hate the flag not pledge allegiance
[1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:04.720]  and then grow up to be communists let's shift gears and trump it's really smart for him to call
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:08.960]  it what it is and say you came here illegally you married your brother you said the country sucks
[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:13.680]  get the hell out then the media spends it oh he said four congressmen women weren't from here no he
[1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:18.880]  was talking about ilhan omar if you read his tweets i'll show some of them to tv viewers
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:23.520]  here right now for radio listeners i'll read them but trump just lays out the common sense
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:30.400]  if it's the worst place on earth get the hell out right well the thing is is what omar is is
[1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:35.520]  she is essentially a jihadist tool over the muslim brotherhood and she's the the perfect
[1:54:36.800 --> 1:54:41.680]  congruence of the radical left in islam they're they're coming together in this alliance
[1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:47.840]  of america hating islamists and america hating uh communist who are or she's she's the perfect
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:54.000]  image of the both of them combined her and keith ellison is another another example of a american
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:59.200]  hating communist who became a muslim because he believed it was it was his best way to fulfill
[1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:03.680]  his communist goals so she's the same way of course she's being handled by the muslim brotherhood
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:10.720]  what is it about ilhan omar and and all the the arrogance of these people i mean they're just so
[1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:16.400]  arrogant well she's confident that she's going to win she's she's a true believer jihadist
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:22.880]  this is this is her mission and they use the identity politics and race card to suppress
[1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:28.160]  dissent in the democratic party now just seems like being done to biden he's being being held
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:32.640]  out there the sacrificial lamb because he's a white male so they're using this identity politics
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:38.720]  weapon uh to weapon they're betting the minorities are a bunch of racist trash well i mean they're
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:42.240]  they're hoping that but but i don't think it's working that's what i'm saying is but they're
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:46.880]  just pushing the most racist garbage i've ever seen well part of it is to suppress uh your your
[1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:51.520]  dissent to shut you up to make you feel like you have to be silent otherwise because the
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:55.600]  race term is so magic but but but i think they've overplayed it don't you do you think trump spart
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:58.480]  to go ahead and throw the gauntlet down and just say get the hell out then if you don't like it
[1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:02.880]  yeah but i think she pointed out what her strategy really is she should point out that she is not
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:10.320]  a moderate muslim she's not like you know hers ali forgot her name is she's not like her a
[1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:15.360]  moderate muslim who loves the united states and and wants to be westernized she's a radical
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:20.880]  aslamist who is pushing the this same agenda as hamas or muslim brotherhood and she's also
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:25.440]  in line with american hating uh communist he should call her out on both of those issues he
[1:56:25.440 --> 1:56:30.800]  should call it out for what it is now i agree what about these fake you know nbc polls just
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:37.040]  like we saw three years ago oh biden warren sanders all ahead of trump and nbc poll i mean this is
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:41.120]  his fake as a three dollar bill well i suspect what they're doing to do frankly i think they're
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:46.720]  gonna need to run uh michelle obama or they're gonna run kamala they're gonna sacrifice biden
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:51.120]  and go for a black woman because they believe they need that to win they need the black vote and they
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:55.920]  need the woman's vote and the people just because of identity will go for it yeah i think i think
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:57:00.000]  they're trying to do an obama point too that's why i think frankly i think it'd be michelle obama
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.240]  you know i'm not sure that you know that's what i've heard they're trying to get her to do it i
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:08.320]  think that's what they think is the magic ticket i think i think they do um she probably picked
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:13.600]  an hispanic as a running mate um or potentially bernie sanders to get that socialist vote
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:20.240]  i'd love to have a black president or or as long as you're not a communist or globalist but it's
[1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:26.160]  like how would anyone want to put somebody like aoc in charge of the country she is just a venomous
[1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:31.600]  demon right we'll run can of solans i guess then to counter that my god it's unbelievable well they
[1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:36.320]  say she's a nazi because we heard so on tv we'll be right back with another second one stewart roes

[1:58:51.360 --> 1:58:55.360]  i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here
[1:58:55.360 --> 1:59:00.160]  out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars
[1:59:00.160 --> 1:59:04.640]  i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know
[1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:08.960]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:13.280]  2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only
[1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:17.040]  way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend
[1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:20.720]  i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you

[1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:35.920]  gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many

[2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:41.520]  married your brother ill on umar get the hell out what do you think of that first time callers only
[2:00:41.520 --> 2:00:47.280]  eight seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:53.840]  stewart roges uh is is our guest eight seven seven seven eight nine alex your calls are coming
[2:00:53.840 --> 2:00:58.080]  up next segment eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine first time callers
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:04.480]  on the terror attacks against ice on the left on their craziness why we were talking to the break
[2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:10.960]  why are they so competent uh not not confident confident i believe they think that they've
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:17.120]  sufficiently brainwashed at least half the country uh to hate the hate the american flag and hit
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:21.280]  their own country they believe that they've you know riding this wave and they'll they'll defeat
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:26.320]  trump through that wave and then bringing in more voters which is what they're doing and then having
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:32.080]  the illegal aliens vote and they might be right they if they can get enough people in before the
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:36.640]  2020 election and then have soros funded buses running around and gathering them all up to go
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:41.920]  vote at the polls in sanctuary cities and sanctuary states where they feel protected the vote
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:46.080]  they may be correct they could get the popular vote and then with the manipulation of the state
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:50.240]  center going to give the electoral college votes to the automatic winner of the popular vote
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:53.920]  that could be their their way to victory so i think they think i think they believe they
[2:01:53.920 --> 2:01:58.080]  can beat trump through those mechanisms and the globalists always plan to use third world
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:03.120]  populations coming in as a checkmate against domestic populations who didn't like globalist
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:07.920]  authoritarianism they're just compressing their plan because they're losing right well they flooded
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:12.720]  europe and so they did it in europe and like you said they bump up the timetable now if hillary had
[2:02:12.720 --> 2:02:17.120]  won that had been it she'd have brought she'd open the doors and brought you know amnesty for all
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:20.640]  they would have been you know given amnesty and more would have come in but now they're pushing
[2:02:20.640 --> 2:02:26.160]  the gates because they have to make sure they've got the maximum number in by the 2020 election
[2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:31.040]  and then have them um had them vote what about this paradigm though because i've been interviewing
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:37.760]  you for more than 15 years longer than that backed in there's no world government there's no plan to
[2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:42.880]  break the borders we had the globalist plan we they had admitted it but no one believed they'd
[2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:48.800]  actually try it now that they're trying the plan that only vindicates us i don't see how even long
[2:02:48.800 --> 2:02:52.640]  term they're going to win when their whole program has been exposed i mean they're in a lot of
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:56.480]  trouble what's the problem is that they do steal the election like i said earlier it's going to
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:03:01.520]  erupt in a civil war because we won't accept the results the problem with that though is that they'll
[2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:05.760]  claim that we're the ones who are anti-democratic that we're the ones who aren't accepting the
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:10.000]  results of the election and they're going to try to get the military and police to crack down on us
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:14.880]  so this is the danger for us is that if they do steal the election we have no choice but to fight
[2:03:14.880 --> 2:03:18.800]  but now will be perceived as the ones who are anti-government again right now they're the ones
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:21.840]  running around you know actually wanting to destroy the government they're the ones that are really
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:26.000]  anti-government so the danger yeah we were always called anti-government imagine if we were running around
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:31.600]  saying our ethos is kill police right i mean all cops are bastards one of their chance you know a
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:35.680]  a cab all cops are bastards and you know they believe this doesn't think it's a good police
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:39.440]  officer because they want to they want to kill them all well they say the only good cops a dead
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:44.240]  cop so everything the left never said about the right wing they're doing well sure they're they're
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:49.200]  openly in these anarchists are openly anti-government and wanted to destroy the united states well i'm
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:53.840]  going to say it they may try it and wreck the country with the dog doesn't hunt well they could
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:58.560]  they could they could turn us into you know if we if we submit to it will be a no you're right from
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:03.600]  the chicon perspective the left winning they know that won't happen but wrecking the country they could
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:08.480]  yeah they could they could throw us into turmoil and here's here's the big danger like i know a lot
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:12.880]  of people have been been war gaming what could happen in a civil war scenario we win every time
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:17.360]  if we're left drawing devices here inside the united states to settle in on ourselves
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:22.080]  but foreign they're going to collapse from latin america completely in 20 million 100 million
[2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:27.680]  it's done they're going to chai comms we'll lay it out right well even even an emp for example would
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:32.720]  be the big kill switch right if they're going to lose a civil war they can do an emp strike blaming
[2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:36.640]  on a foreign power like rusher or whatever and then just wipe us off the face of the earth through
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:42.560]  starvation all right let's take some calls when we come back at eight seven seven seven eight nine
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:47.280]  alex and let's talk about the civil war scenario that's been working about a lot of smart folks
[2:04:47.280 --> 2:04:50.480]  and then you're going to host the fourth hour hell you got to get into that then
[2:04:50.480 --> 2:04:52.960]  steward roads of oath keepers dot orgs our gas stay with us
[2:04:56.400 --> 2:05:00.800]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing
[2:05:00.800 --> 2:05:06.080]  that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:10.480]  corporate donor or corporate trigger daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[2:05:10.480 --> 2:05:14.720]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[2:05:14.720 --> 2:05:20.240]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:24.160]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[2:05:24.160 --> 2:05:28.560]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[2:05:28.560 --> 2:05:32.480]  the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:36.640]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and
[2:05:36.640 --> 2:05:42.320]  manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience
[2:05:42.320 --> 2:05:47.440]  has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate
[2:05:47.440 --> 2:05:51.680]  american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the
[2:05:51.680 --> 2:05:55.200]  black warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth
[2:05:55.200 --> 2:06:11.120]  discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the alex jones show
[2:06:26.080 --> 2:06:30.560]  all right steward rose we're going to take phone calls here at 877789 alex from first
[2:06:30.560 --> 2:06:35.200]  time callers on the left trying to start a civil war they've attacked an ice facility they're
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:39.680]  attacking myself others everybody saying they want to trigger civil war all over the country
[2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:44.640]  singing and others are praising this guy that went out and did this we've shown all the articles
[2:06:44.640 --> 2:06:50.400]  we're going to talk about that with the callers uh we're also going to get into trump i think
[2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:56.720]  telling it like it is saying listen ill on omar came here as a teenager from war torn
[2:06:56.720 --> 2:07:01.520]  somalia with islamist fighting over power no christians allowed no lipstick allowed no college
[2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:07.200]  for girls no school for girls burka for girls you come here and you hate america he says if you
[2:07:07.200 --> 2:07:13.520]  hate it you can't leave fast enough they spent that as racist not about race it's about ideology
[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:19.840]  yeah it's about her her own hatred of this country that she has been ungrateful for this is the best
[2:07:19.840 --> 2:07:23.600]  country on the face of the earth which is why she's here in the first place that she comes here and
[2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:29.040]  wants to condemn it and she's adopted and jumped in with radical leftist who hate this country
[2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:33.680]  let's read some of these tweets from the president so interesting to see progressive
[2:07:33.680 --> 2:07:38.080]  democrat congresswoman who originally came from countries whose governments are complete in total
[2:07:38.080 --> 2:07:43.360]  catastrophe the worst most corrupt in an act anywhere in the world if they even have a functioning
[2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:50.160]  government at all now loudly when viciously telling people of the united states that the greatest
[2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:56.640]  and most powerful nation on earth how our government is to be run why don't they go back and help fix
[2:07:56.640 --> 2:08:03.600]  the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came they come back and show us how
[2:08:03.600 --> 2:08:08.320]  and imagine like if you moved to some other country you'd been there for 30 years 20 years
[2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:12.320]  and you get elected their government you tell them how they suck though i played the video
[2:08:12.320 --> 2:08:17.280]  yesterday where she says america's bad but i'll teach you how to be good i mean something's wrong
[2:08:17.280 --> 2:08:23.840]  with this lady it is done these places need your help badly since you tell us how to live
[2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:29.360]  you can't leave fast enough i'm sure that ancy polosi will be very happy to quickly work out
[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:34.160]  free travel arrangements and the president went on from there and then here's the quote
[2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:39.760]  omar questions the patriotism american born citizens she says someone not born here is better
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:46.560]  than natural born and that she will teach you how to be an american what do you say about that well
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:51.680]  i mean i think this is vintis trump his response is spot on you know she is she's pulling the race
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:57.440]  card and she is trying to shame us all into you know feeling that we're not real americans she's
[2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:03.920]  the real american the islamicist america hating you know radical leftist is is the real america
[2:09:03.920 --> 2:09:08.880]  what shows how americans aren't arrogant and aren't a power trip we're so christian
[2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:13.920]  even the original ethos like you're right we're sinners show us how we're bad and this demon
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:18.400]  goes well i'll tell you as the accuser you're a piece of filth she would i say we go you're right
[2:09:18.400 --> 2:09:23.680]  they use a twisted form of christianity because we admit we're following our problems we aren't
[2:09:23.680 --> 2:09:30.000]  arrogant like her they use that against us well she's playing on on leftist white guilt also on
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:35.760]  all the radical leftist believes sincerely that look at beta look at beta or work you know confessing
[2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:40.400]  that his his ancestors own slaves you know they're running around falling over themselves trying to
[2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:45.280]  apologize for being the worst country in the face of the earth because i agree whites are bad right
[2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:49.920]  so she just jumps in and says yes that's exactly right you're all horrible so next thing she's
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:55.520]  going to do is tell us all to kill ourselves yeah well good luck she says we all know that aoc and the
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:00.720]  crowd are a bunch of communists they hate israel they hate our country they're calling the guards
[2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:05.280]  along our border patrol agents concentration camp guards they use people of supporting israel
[2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:11.360]  doing it for the benjamin's and he goes on to break all of this down i mean this is absolutely
[2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:15.840]  got to panic them this this is exactly what he needs to say and he needs to go ahead drop the next
[2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:21.360]  shoe which is to say and they're going to try to steal the election through massive vote fraud
[2:10:21.360 --> 2:10:25.520]  that's what they're bringing all these people in that's what he should say the democrats want to
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:30.160]  unite quoting trump from twitter democrats want to unite around the foul language and racist hatred
[2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:35.360]  spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular unrepresentative congresswomen it will
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:41.600]  be interesting to see how it plays out i can tell you that they have made israel feel abandoned by
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:46.000]  the united states and then he goes on from there so sad the democrats sticking up for people who
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:51.600]  speak so badly for our country let me ask you this why is it that most these women come from
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:56.240]  countries where women aren't allowed outside the house and were hoods over their heads and are killed
[2:10:56.240 --> 2:11:01.920]  of the smart mouths of their husband it's so weird that they don't reject the ethos of radical
[2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:08.160]  orthodox you know dirt floor islam then they come here though and rise up as women and tell us
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:14.400]  american men suck is that they're so threatened by the red blood no it's because this is jihad
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:18.000]  they're controlled by their husbands she's no she's a jihadist she's controlled by the muslim
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:22.480]  brotherhood yeah that's her that's her whole point of being here is she's funded by that
[2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:27.840]  absolutely and that's why that's why so many simoleons were brought here by obama be a vote
[2:11:27.840 --> 2:11:34.080]  a voting bloc in minnesota now i toured minnesota for speaking to her it's it's simoleon well it is
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:39.120]  and then they came in such large numbers that they and they throw openly all the time little white
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:44.880]  kids off the mall of america they just fall and crash and they just celebrate i mean stabbing
[2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:50.560]  people murdering people it's just like worship them worship them worship them right so they never
[2:11:50.560 --> 2:11:55.520]  intend to assimilate i mean as you both we both know if you come here to assimilate i don't care
[2:11:55.520 --> 2:12:01.440]  where you're from i care what color you are but if you come here for conquest then you're a domestic
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:06.720]  enemy now i just don't get it i came in from samalia and i got free welfare and i got elected
[2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:11.120]  to congress i'd go hey this is a pretty good country she'd be nothing in samalia but i guess
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:16.400]  she's such a cult programmed stockum syndrome that she just even though she'd have she couldn't even
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:22.000]  speak in public in samalia but here she will rule well this is the problem with all of these
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:27.040]  left this is the problem is they're using women because they know a leftist in the united states
[2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:32.400]  a white leftist for example will will feel that they have to you know coddle and protect these
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:37.600]  these poor women are being persecuted by by trump that's why they use women human shields just like
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:41.280]  sure terrorist they're there they're there they're their tickets kind of like that when they when
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:46.000]  they ran obama because he was half black you got to run a muslim black woman that's like the
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:52.080]  epitome of the of the victim mindset in this country the most oppressed is a black woman muslim
[2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:56.560]  so whenever trump attacks them all it does is reinforce in their mind the trump of the nazi
[2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:01.680]  that's the downside to him doing what he's doing all the way i think is what he's doing is great
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:06.400]  you know go ahead and fire it off oh let's just go all the way right i mean i mean he ought to
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:12.000]  invite her like okay i'll give you 20 million taxpayer money go help samalia lady i mean just
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:17.200]  just just put she won't do it she just comes here knowing we have a soul knowing that we care and she
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:21.920]  tells us how much we suck because the whole point is conquest i mean it really is i mean years ago
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:27.920]  i was a more of an open borders libertarian much more skeptical of the threat of islam but now back
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:32.480]  when you work for ron po yeah i mean but now you can't deny it this is liquid it's not even the
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:36.960]  immigrants are bad they've been weaponized yeah they're putting refugee camps they're brainwashed
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:41.920]  for six months and then they're fired at us and they're taught not to assimilate and they're taught
[2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:46.640]  like you said before to hate this country they're taught that by the radical leftist who also hate
[2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:52.560]  this country but even the dali lama vladimir putin top leftist professors that live in sweden and
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:57.760]  germany are like okay we were wrong this was a setup why did we do this right well europe is now
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:02.880]  starting to wake up look what's going on in france you got massive rallies by legal aliens demanding
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:07.200]  citizenship taking government buildings over right you know that's eventually it'll be the same
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:12.000]  thing here you'll see you'll see the washington monument you're probably torn down by by radical
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:18.320]  islamist and and uh and other foreigners but i don't get if we're so unsuperior why do they
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:24.880]  want to be here then conquest yeah yeah for these lamas if it's conquest and it's also conquest for
[2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:30.560]  little rosa another other radical marches groups like that to reconquist it i mean i wish americans
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:34.560]  had that not even a feeling of conquest but a feeling of self-defense because i don't want to
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:40.000]  run anything but i won't be run well we do feel that way we're looking at this though here's a
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:44.480]  problem is trump is not doing what he can do and should do as commander in chief no i agree we should
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:48.000]  actually i never used to be for these wars but now that the whole thing's collapsed well i'm sorry
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:52.640]  go ahead no i mean trump needs to take action and the political right in this country is waiting
[2:14:52.640 --> 2:14:56.960]  for him and watching waiting for him to take action we elected him as the commander in chief to
[2:14:56.960 --> 2:15:02.960]  take care of this unless he acts as commander in chief very soon it's going to be over as far as a
[2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:07.280]  political solution in this country we'll have no recourse but to fight that's what they're by the
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:12.080]  way folks this isn't rhetoric anyway you slice it no the leftist already think it's a physical war
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:16.560]  yeah well it already is a physical war um bernstein was correct we're gonna we're in a cold civil war
[2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:21.120]  it's beginning to go hot now with radical marches we'll see you know two years ago i said that they'll
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:24.800]  eventually turn into weather underground we're going to start going kinetic with with guns and
[2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:30.800]  with bombs and we just saw that on saturday well we're not taking it lying down that's for sure
[2:15:30.800 --> 2:15:34.560]  they don't want to fight they're gonna get one but we better work hard now to stop it ladies and
[2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:38.800]  gentlemen we gotta push trump to do what he can do now because the un invasion isn't gonna be you

[2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:38.640]  all right andrew m.i.a. lyle ben joe jim michael anthony connor all first time callers we're
[2:20:38.640 --> 2:20:42.400]  going to you right now street roads my guest he's going to punch you out in about 10 minutes he's
[2:20:42.400 --> 2:20:46.080]  going to come back in the fourth hour the host today ahead of the war with oh and shroyer
[2:20:46.080 --> 2:20:52.800]  we were talking to the break just briefly i agree with you if trump doesn't take action now he's
[2:20:52.800 --> 2:20:57.280]  being told he's going to win re-election they've got internal polls he knows he's 15 20 points ahead
[2:20:57.280 --> 2:21:01.440]  from the fake polls that doesn't matter the democrats and all the fraud we've seen they
[2:21:01.440 --> 2:21:07.120]  already wanted him out they'll break any rule it's been proven that millions 1.3 million voted
[2:21:07.120 --> 2:21:12.720]  legally in california the judicial washes won a lawsuit two weeks ago they're going for broke
[2:21:12.720 --> 2:21:16.880]  and they're going to use the election as the cleanest way to get him out sure they're going to
[2:21:16.880 --> 2:21:22.320]  swamp it like i said before all these sanctuary cities as well as a mistake to send the you
[2:21:22.320 --> 2:21:27.840]  know asylum seekers to sanctuary cities because all that does is make them voting blocks sheltered
[2:21:27.840 --> 2:21:33.440]  illegal voting blocks in those cities or those states and that's the game plan i mean if they
[2:21:33.440 --> 2:21:37.600]  were if they thought there was going to be republican voters coming in from other countries
[2:21:37.600 --> 2:21:43.040]  you could see the wall from space that they would build to stop those country republican voters
[2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:46.480]  from coming in but because they know that predominantly they're going to vote democrats
[2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:52.880]  especially when they're being encouraged by the democrats to to vote and voted legally they know
[2:21:52.880 --> 2:21:57.280]  they're going to vote democrat and they'll get a permanent lock on power and colter is correct
[2:21:57.280 --> 2:22:04.160]  about that and they've been bragging that the democrats now admit this it's just total insanity
[2:22:04.160 --> 2:22:09.840]  let's go to phone calls here uh let's go ahead and talk to connor than ansony and others connor
[2:22:09.840 --> 2:22:15.600]  on the air from indiana thanks for holding hey alex uh so great to talk to you um i actually
[2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:19.440]  wanted to make a few points uh my wife is actually from the philippines and we went through the
[2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:25.280]  legal immigration process and it's taken so much time so much money and i've actually had to give
[2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:31.840]  up a lot of my personal documentation and hers as well to get here and i don't know my my kind of
[2:22:31.840 --> 2:22:38.000]  i don't want to say hatred for illegal immigrants and kind of swell over like the last you know
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:42.640]  months or so this thing going on cash has been outflowing for my wallet and you know to see
[2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:48.080]  these people wanting open borders is pretty sick to me so well i agree with you we should make people
[2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:52.160]  that aren't criminals and have skills easier to be citizens but the democrats want a permanent
[2:22:52.160 --> 2:22:56.960]  underclass and so they just say oh come on in we'll legalize you but you're never really a
[2:22:56.960 --> 2:23:02.960]  citizen they suck off of you that's exactly right and to see illan omar not even she just
[2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:08.160]  stayed completely silent when they uh desecrated her flag and you know i actually watched the
[2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:13.360]  patreon with my wife i mean it's not the most historically accurate movie but she's a pro-trump
[2:23:13.360 --> 2:23:19.680]  immigrant and all this stuff and she just loves our country she's so grateful to be here and uh i
[2:23:19.680 --> 2:23:26.000]  just think it's sick that you know illan omar being an assaili refugee you know from simalia to just
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:31.360]  stay silent on the desecration of her flag one open borders all this stuff is just disgusting and
[2:23:31.360 --> 2:23:35.520]  i'm well it's like stewart road said my friend god bless you connor and god bless your american
[2:23:35.520 --> 2:23:39.840]  wife because you love american you love freedom you're an american that's the problem the left
[2:23:39.840 --> 2:23:44.320]  puts them in refugee centers for six months on average brain washes them and then ships them up

[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:33.920]  and i've never seen so many months i when i moved with my husband here i just i noticed the difference
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:40.080]  of the you know area and i've been concerned about it ever since and so when we were at a picnic all
[2:34:40.080 --> 2:34:47.360]  day on fourth of july swimming at a pool with family aunts uncles um we got home we got ready we went to
[2:34:47.360 --> 2:34:57.040]  the local city our city fireworks display and i i helix i just looked around i couldn't believe it i
[2:34:57.040 --> 2:35:05.840]  mean we must have been like literally in like a no go zone in my own city you know and i didn't want
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:10.480]  to make a big deal out of it in front of my husband because he gets met he you know he's kind of like
[2:35:10.480 --> 2:35:16.160]  you're so sensitive to it you know whatever so anyhow we sat down and he went and got ice cream
[2:35:16.160 --> 2:35:21.520]  with the kids and i just looked around i couldn't help it i started videotaping and i was getting
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:27.120]  angry and i just said where's your red white and blue where everyone was wearing like black it was
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:33.760]  you know no one had a flag no one had a american t-shirt nothing nothing let's be clear it wasn't
[2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:39.760]  the burkas it wasn't the hijabs it wasn't the black clothing of obviously super orthodox muslims
[2:35:39.760 --> 2:35:45.120]  it was that there wasn't any american flags they were just there for the fireworks you know well
[2:35:45.120 --> 2:35:50.560]  yeah i mean you're just there to see fireworks and i remember going last year and i had to leave
[2:35:50.560 --> 2:35:55.200]  last year because i thought maybe it was just a weird night and and i just didn't like the scene and
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:36:01.840]  um anyhow so i'm taking a man i get how you're freaked out i've been in restaurants okay where
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:07.440]  there's literally a third of the restaurant or half is men with women in burkas they take the
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:13.200]  food and go under it it's people like in halloween outfits and they're so arrogant about everyone kisses
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:18.960]  that are ass they're very like gay people come over and go oh we love you you know they want to kill
[2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:24.640]  them and it's just so obscene so i get what you're saying the the incompatibility of all this so so
[2:36:24.640 --> 2:36:32.560]  tell us oh you videotaped in public was that that angered them so tell us what happened so i'm videotaping
[2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:37.440]  and i'm saying look at this city westlake you know and i was making comments well someone must have
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:41.760]  heard me she came up to me she was you better get out of here something bad's going to happen to you
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:46.880]  and i'm you know i kind of i must have said obviously i i fought back i said what are you
[2:36:46.880 --> 2:36:50.800]  talking about this is my city in my country but where's your right you know and then i went on the
[2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:58.400]  american where's your you know representation of our country nothing and one of her friends or whoever
[2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:06.000]  another muslim in the area must have ran to the police because within seconds i had about six
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:12.880]  caps on me like as if i had pulled a gun or something and i was just i couldn't believe it
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:18.240]  you know i felt like so i'm still shocked i'm still in shock i swear to god and so what
[2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:22.480]  and so the police let me guess they tricked you into getting upset and claim you did something to
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:27.760]  them what did they charge you with because he originally said i'm i said what are you arresting
[2:37:27.760 --> 2:37:31.520]  me for he said i thought i said what you're lying i said i never touched anybody and i
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:38.080]  swear to you on my kid's life i didn't touch anybody sure of course so um they put you know
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:44.320]  they bring me over to the car in handcuffs i said officer just let me get my thing and let me just
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:50.400]  get my husband and my kid and get in the car and go home and you know and he wouldn't let me oh he's
[2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:55.200]  going to get a promotion for teaching a dirty american to lay down and take it so what happened
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:38:00.720]  he claimed you bumped him or something these are two particular officers and then they wanted you
[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:04.480]  know they were treating me like crap and they wanted my name and i said do i have to give you my name
[2:38:04.480 --> 2:38:08.640]  you know i was like come back so how did it end what do they charge you with well they ended up
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:15.200]  charging me with um disorderly conduct and failure to disclose my name to being a dirty american
[2:38:15.840 --> 2:38:20.880]  well don't worry you go for a jury trial you don't play bargain and we should we should i want your

[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:54.720]  dot com falling into trump's trap boy did she have a river by morning hello she pushed his house
[2:47:54.720 --> 2:48:01.520]  resolution to condemn the president to say an ilhan omar who runs her stinking mouth constantly
[2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:05.280]  never had a job since she moved here married her brother to move here
[2:48:06.640 --> 2:48:12.160]  pled guilty to tax fraud i mean she's a dirty lazy piece of garbage
[2:48:12.160 --> 2:48:20.240]  now having fallen to president trump's trap house speaker nancy polosi announced a house resolution
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:22.960]  condemning the president's attack representative illan omar
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  latter of whom is unpopular among swing state voters according to a major poll
[2:48:30.640 --> 2:48:37.120]  president trump indirectly blasted omar a member of the squad of four far left representatives
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:42.000]  over the past weekend by practically stating that if she hates america so much
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:46.320]  she should go back to her country she fled and worked to fix the living standards there
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:52.960]  yeah it's like if you moved out of switzerland and let's say went to guatemala because you're a
[2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:58.480]  christian to help people that's laudable to be they're trying to help them but when you come from

[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:18.640]  ohio where he's got another caller from go ahead ben you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:55:19.520 --> 2:55:23.360]  hey alex i've been trying to get a hold of you guys for about four months now so welcome through
[2:55:24.160 --> 2:55:28.560]  first of all uh i'm a little off topic with what you guys are talking about i'm talking about the
[2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:33.680]  censoring going on on facebook and stuff well that's fine go ahead well uh i'm an expert
[2:55:33.680 --> 2:55:39.040]  in knowing about that because i had a site on there that had over 250 000 followers and for no
[2:55:39.040 --> 2:55:43.440]  reason at all facebook just deleted my whole account i mean just everything gone well i'm sure
[2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:49.520]  the reason was that you were a pro freedom person right well it gets a lot deeper than that when
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:55.280]  you hear everything i got to say well i contacted them and they said it was an oopsy and that their
[2:55:55.280 --> 2:56:02.160]  algorithm got me which is absolutely a croc now here's how i know that it's a crop i got so kicked
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:07.920]  off then i started my own website and it's identical to facebook in every way shape or form get on
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:13.360]  there take a look at it it's called censor wars dot com now i already have a couple people on the
[2:56:13.360 --> 2:56:22.160]  ron gibson's on there uh the resistance 17 sounds good censored wars dot com censor wars dot com
[2:56:22.160 --> 2:56:26.560]  it's identical to facebook in every way shape and form everything you could do on facebook you could
[2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:31.600]  do on my site and there's absolutely no censoring going on well that's exciting but before we get
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:41.600]  back into censored wars or whatever um specifically if they said it was an algorithm mistake did they
[2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:47.440]  reinstate your facebook absolutely not i got nothing back and i know see here's thing me owning
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:52.000]  my own site i have all the options that they have and i could tell you right now that there are no
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:56.560]  algorithms out there that are sure no no the algorithms are made up deal the algorithms or
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:57:04.960]  whatever you click on it gives you more of um but have you spanned on that uh it's people that are
[2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:12.320]  censoring a physical person has to get on a keyboard and push delete before they can delete a page
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:18.160]  or a group or or an account and that's that's how simple it is so anytime they say it was an oops
[2:57:18.160 --> 2:57:23.280]  and an algorithm got you or one of their bugs got you sure that's just some fancy thing they tell
[2:57:23.280 --> 2:57:28.240]  congress we've got all the internal videos we have their own logs we know it's it's people
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:34.000]  it's armies of meth head professors and drooling antifa literally scooting over all your wife's
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:42.160]  photos on the iCloud apple literally has tens of thousands of potbelly pdps pedophiles literally
[2:57:42.160 --> 2:57:47.680]  over all your info let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:57:47.680 --> 2:57:52.160]  hey oh yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people
[2:57:52.160 --> 2:57:56.800]  here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[2:57:56.800 --> 2:58:01.200]  wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because
[2:58:01.200 --> 2:58:05.440]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the
[2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:09.920]  approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[2:58:09.920 --> 2:58:13.760]  the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my
[2:58:13.760 --> 2:58:17.600]  friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut
[2:58:17.600 --> 2:58:22.880]  you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years

[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:22.240]  and the liberals who blocked the funding this year and last year act like it's their fault when
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:26.400]  they're the ones that blocked the funding and it's the democrats that announced the open border
[3:02:26.400 --> 3:02:33.120]  is that not sick it's just the most second thing that you could imagine it's like if i announced
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:40.800]  at your house without you knowing hey uh gavin's having a party this saturday free food free beer
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:45.840]  and uh jz is going to be playing there at midnight you'd probably have a thousand people show up at
[3:02:45.840 --> 3:02:51.120]  your three bedroom house and then i'd show up as a democrats when you didn't have jz there free
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:57.680]  food or beer and i'd say gavin you bastard you criminal you didn't have jz there are all the free
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:04.560]  beer well you'd say to me hey alex you're the one that put the lie out think about that no you're
[3:03:04.560 --> 3:03:11.280]  exactly right and it's just unbelievable in every sense of the word i meant to get to it you want
[3:03:11.280 --> 3:03:16.000]  to see these i watched the hearing last week i watched this weekend where they go how dare you
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:22.320]  separate families they go we've got thousands showing up a day per sector and most of them aren't
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:26.080]  with their parents you understand most the kids are begging for mommy we're sending them back to
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:31.360]  their parents a lot of them are kidnapped they go that's easy for you to say as a white man
[3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:38.560]  man and it's just like you're like what the hell are these people talking about it's like
[3:03:38.560 --> 3:03:43.760]  is there any into it it's so like this one woman from a why he's like a demonic turtle
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:49.840]  and she just sits there and spouts this stuff and you're like i don't know where do you think
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:56.240]  all this goes gavin uh honestly with the way that the spectrum is and that there's why does it
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:04:00.160]  become i think there's just too many options to take into account i couldn't really give you a
[3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:04.240]  definitive answer i hear you there are a lot of delusional people that work for the system and
[3:04:04.240 --> 3:04:09.120]  they're going to say whatever they want because they know america is soft and if they accuse
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:13.520]  us of being nazis we'll do whatever they say well it's got to come to an end that's why trump
[3:04:13.520 --> 3:04:20.560]  calling ilhan ohmar a joke and a moron and somebody needs to get the hell out is good
[3:04:20.560 --> 3:04:27.440]  stop bowing to i don't like the american flag on the nineties yes sir we'll take it off right now
[3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:33.280]  you know i don't like the star spangled banner we'll stop that you know i don't like families
[3:04:33.280 --> 3:04:37.360]  you know what don't say mother or father okay we won't say that you know it's like
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:45.040]  what level won't we bow to the left because the media will beat us up beat me up i'm ready for it
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:51.600]  more calls straight ahead and then coming in in one segment both keepers
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:58.880]  bb what does big tech become a big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way
[3:04:58.880 --> 3:05:03.280]  they did so is because they face no consequence social economic political or legal for their
[3:05:03.280 --> 3:05:07.920]  illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries
[3:05:07.920 --> 3:05:11.680]  the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary members of the public
[3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:16.080]  and the audience that care about this has to bring real social political economic consequence
[3:05:16.080 --> 3:05:19.680]  to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech
[3:05:19.680 --> 3:05:24.080]  oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and ran
[3:05:24.080 --> 3:05:28.240]  american economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great depression
[3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:33.680]  the informers audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty across the world to make
[3:05:33.680 --> 3:05:38.320]  real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an independent
[3:05:38.320 --> 3:05:42.800]  free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other
[3:05:42.800 --> 3:05:47.120]  to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling
[3:05:47.120 --> 3:05:51.120]  us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw
[3:05:51.120 --> 3:05:53.680]  isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[3:06:05.920 --> 3:06:14.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny will so does he lie from
[3:06:14.960 --> 3:06:20.800]  the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones you know i don't want to conquer anybody i want to
[3:06:20.800 --> 3:06:25.200]  run anybody's life but i'll tell you this i might have this money run mine you want a war
[3:06:26.160 --> 3:06:30.000]  you want an information war you want the end of political correctness you're gonna get it now
[3:06:30.880 --> 3:06:34.400]  not by a bunch of buck toothed racists that hate people because what color they are
[3:06:34.400 --> 3:06:39.040]  no the left are the ones pushing race but by red blooded christians of every race color and creed
[3:06:39.040 --> 3:06:43.680]  aren't bound to a bunch of syria law and a bunch of leftist communism and a bunch of crap
[3:06:43.680 --> 3:06:50.240]  your hoax of bullying us is coming to an end now i got loaded phone lines but i'm gonna try to jam
[3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:53.440]  a few more in then i got a few clips i'm gonna play they're very important and then stewart
[3:06:53.440 --> 3:06:59.440]  rhodes is taking over and the rest of the fourth hour from oath keepers but right now let's go
[3:06:59.440 --> 3:07:04.560]  ahead and go to andrew in idaho member of oath keepers wants to talk about trump's tweets on
[3:07:04.560 --> 3:07:12.240]  ill on omar go ahead sir hi there alex good brother hey uh long time with sir i've been with
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:17.360]  you since uh i think bohemian grove in 911 then with stewart rhodes since after he founded oath
[3:07:17.360 --> 3:07:21.360]  keepers in katrina i'm actually so you've been you've been tuned in 20 years sir we salute you
[3:07:22.320 --> 3:07:27.120]  a long time 35 years old so i've been doing a yeah i spent about 15 16 years old that's great
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:30.800]  i'm gonna figure out this puzzle figure out this puzzle with you let me ask you this then how
[3:07:30.800 --> 3:07:36.800]  did you first was it shortwave or how'd you first do the show i think it was a youtube before google
[3:07:36.800 --> 3:07:42.960]  bought it just looking at the bohemian grove video it's probably the first that was about 16 years
[3:07:42.960 --> 3:07:49.760]  ago okay go ahead well i was basically gonna say and uh sorry i'm highly intelligent not to do my
[3:07:49.760 --> 3:07:55.680]  own horn but i'm not very well spoken a lot of time but i was basically gonna say you know the
[3:07:55.680 --> 3:08:00.240]  reason they don't want to fix their own countries or improve themselves is that that they cannot
[3:08:00.240 --> 3:08:04.320]  beat you in that way they cannot beat you with an intellectual dialogue they cannot they must
[3:08:04.320 --> 3:08:10.000]  constantly shut down your freedom of speech to if you shut down your freedom of speech so that they
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:13.600]  you know can have like pretty much a gossip ring about you instead i don't know how to explain
[3:08:13.600 --> 3:08:18.640]  that any better way but no i don't like the name listen they all the twisted there are a lot of
[3:08:18.640 --> 3:08:22.480]  great folks from the third world they want to come here and be part of it but the twisted and
[3:08:22.480 --> 3:08:27.200]  evil never want to build it themselves they always want to step in and run it all they always want
[3:08:27.200 --> 3:08:32.400]  to run it and take control of it they want to step in at the top level they don't want to build
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:37.760]  something for 30 40 years to try to be in charge to empower humanity with great responsibility
[3:08:37.760 --> 3:08:44.160]  they want to just right away step into power exactly and i think kind of their plan is also
[3:08:44.160 --> 3:08:47.520]  to swamp us with numbers kind of like the persian army going against fardons you know they know
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:53.600]  they're not the elite so they must kind of bring in as many numbers as they possibly can to kill
[3:08:53.600 --> 3:09:00.400]  us that way but uh yeah just a quick rundown on my background my grandfather was grandfather raised
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:04.800]  me like his only son his pal bentley's uh first cousin's and good friends with clion scousen and
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:09.360]  it's just a great honor to be with you sir well it's great to be with you brother god bless you
[3:09:09.360 --> 3:09:14.800]  what a great patriot clion scousen right up there in the same area you're at thank you so much look
[3:09:15.520 --> 3:09:20.240]  we got loaded phones with lile and joe and jim and michael and i've got all these clips to get to i
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:23.760]  need to get to them all but i want to take these calls as well let's just give each caller 30
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:32.160]  seconds so they don't get no time lile in colorado go ahead hey elix thanks uh long time listener
[3:09:32.160 --> 3:09:40.000]  first time caller love your bodies x2 ultra 12 brain force i'm a i'm an oil field worker um
[3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:47.280]  travel around quite a bit and uh i'm 61 years old and i'm out rolling around 500 pound 55 gallon
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:52.560]  drums with 20 something so thanks for that brother it's uh i'm not gonna mess with you those rough
[3:09:52.560 --> 3:09:59.520]  necks are tough well i was thinking about loading up a couple bus loads of them and uh backing up
[3:09:59.520 --> 3:10:06.560]  the proud boys at one of these uh patriot prayer rallies uh because that'd be just like uh they
[3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:15.280]  beat each other up going out drinking on a friday night uh so uh yeah they they would shred those
[3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:23.040]  larping little pajama draped whatever they are i don't know man but uh well yeah that's still one
[3:10:23.040 --> 3:10:27.040]  of the roughest things out there is oil field workers that there's not people complaining
[3:10:27.040 --> 3:10:35.120]  about osha rules out there well i mean well up here in northern colorado with uh jared polis i
[3:10:35.120 --> 3:10:41.120]  mean we run a pretty tight ship um and there i mean we follow all the rules and oh i know but
[3:10:41.120 --> 3:10:48.880]  i'm just saying that's still a rough profession absolutely um you know i i just i'm i'm i'm
[3:10:48.880 --> 3:10:54.320]  perplexed about trump's uh situation at the southern border still i i don't want to say
[3:10:54.320 --> 3:11:02.720]  it's a straight up scyop but that that communist it's in power in mexico i mean it's you know
[3:11:02.720 --> 3:11:09.120]  they got 15 000 troops at the us mexican border and only 6000 at the southern you know and isn't
[3:11:09.120 --> 3:11:14.240]  that kind of bass awkward um you know sure the mexican troops are making sure the narcotics
[3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:22.160]  come across the mexico is a total narcotics state yes a failed narco state and i wondered if you'd
[3:11:22.160 --> 3:11:29.040]  heard anything uh that dressing not more along the same lines el salvador which has a communist
[3:11:29.040 --> 3:11:35.520]  in power now um i've heard from other alternative news sources pretty reliable that uh right now
[3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:41.360]  what they're doing down there is they're they're they're training uh these military age men in
[3:11:41.360 --> 3:11:49.760]  prisons 16 to 25 they're being co-opted by local ms 13 and the 18th street gangs down there oh
[3:11:49.760 --> 3:11:54.640]  that's it they're attacking mexico and the us i have articles here that's the special camps they've
[3:11:54.640 --> 3:11:59.920]  got as the military age men that they find with certain tattoos and that's where the left so
[3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:03.680]  pissed that they're stopping is they're literally trying to bring them in as their cannon fodder
[3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:09.920]  yes yeah and and then but but not only that they're in within their own country apparently
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:14.720]  they're doing what they're they're extorting money they're collecting what's called war taxes
[3:12:14.720 --> 3:12:21.280]  killing the head of the family the males and then abducting the women and uh and you know
[3:12:21.280 --> 3:12:28.560]  putting them into slavery or whatever you know for human trafficking and then uh also confiscating
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:34.880]  homes and property and according to the sources i was listening to these groups of men that they're
[3:12:34.880 --> 3:12:40.320]  actually training in prison that are going to be released and co-opted are going to be like the
[3:12:41.040 --> 3:12:47.760]  last wave or surge on our southern border exactly that's that's all part of ms 13 it's why you saw
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:54.240]  the democrats say they're god's children and this is the collapse of civilization this is how islam
[3:12:54.240 --> 3:12:59.200]  operates it's how latin america is now operating and it's the total collapse of civilization this
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:08.160]  is the globalist war and it's it's it's it's it's hezbollah it's ms 13 uh it's it's all of this
[3:13:08.160 --> 3:13:13.840]  together absolutely right i'm out of time i meant to play katelyn bennett's new incredible video
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:17.760]  that we're going to get posted to info wars dot com we'll definitely have it during the war room
[3:13:17.760 --> 3:13:23.680]  in about 45 minutes uh where they they asked the left to take illegal aliens in but they won't
[3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:27.920]  they said oh i've got a victim first very powerful video going up on info wars dot com
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:33.760]  this other admission by the big tech summit anti-big tech summit that were the main target
[3:13:33.760 --> 3:13:41.120]  that video and more that's coming up uh today and again i'm sorry to uh joe and jim and michael
[3:13:41.120 --> 3:13:46.160]  if you i got to a lot of calls today we did a pretty good job so if you call me back tomorrow
[3:13:47.760 --> 3:13:51.360]  during the wakeday show i will go right to you and again i'm gonna say this clearly
[3:13:51.360 --> 3:13:57.440]  we were massively behind this year in the funding we need to just continue
[3:13:58.560 --> 3:14:03.920]  but i've really worked hard promoted products to some good ads and part of that deficit was
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:08.640]  taken away to where we're able to operate right now and i've always been so confident
[3:14:08.640 --> 3:14:12.160]  that i haven't really worried about it but i've really got to tell listeners now is the time
[3:14:12.160 --> 3:14:17.840]  of support i i want to thank you i'm not complaining we haven't supported enough but my god if we
[3:14:17.840 --> 3:14:22.880]  not proven with the tip of the spear we need your financial support and we make it easy now i i got
[3:14:22.880 --> 3:14:26.640]  i've never been a marketer i always just sell what i think is the best and the highest quality at
[3:14:26.640 --> 3:14:31.440]  low prices and i got told by a few people we talked to over the years hey you keep selling
[3:14:31.440 --> 3:14:37.200]  everything so discounted you're selling unbelievable amounts but if you sell 30 million dollars in a
[3:14:37.200 --> 3:14:41.200]  year but you only make five million six million dollars that doesn't fund your operation so that's
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:46.160]  kind of the paradox we're in is you know selling 40 million dollars and stuff that making 10 million
[3:14:46.160 --> 3:14:50.400]  dollars that does not fund all these crew members and all these people and what we're doing and
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:14:55.280]  the expansions we need to do and and all the things i mean buzz feed and stuff get 50 million a year
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:15:01.760]  you know vice gets 600 million from you know and then the fox gets 250 million from mbc we could run
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:07.360]  for five six seven years off that because that's pure money that's not like products sold and

[3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:57.920]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding hey i just want to
[3:17:57.920 --> 3:18:02.320]  say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city
[3:18:02.320 --> 3:18:06.640]  and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[3:18:06.640 --> 3:18:11.680]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[3:18:11.680 --> 3:18:16.400]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[3:18:16.400 --> 3:18:19.840]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could
[3:18:19.840 --> 3:18:23.920]  be defeated other than assassinating him it's the time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and
[3:18:23.920 --> 3:18:27.520]  the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the

[3:19:57.520 --> 3:20:13.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:27.520 --> 3:20:40.640]  the spirit rose both keepers i'm filling in for the last part of the segment for the show
[3:20:40.640 --> 3:20:52.640]  and i want to take colors at 877-789-2539 that's 877-789-2539 we'll talk about the terror attack on
[3:20:52.640 --> 3:20:58.720]  the ice facility on saturday and also the attempt to take down or the flag taking down on friday
[3:20:58.720 --> 3:21:03.520]  where the mexican flag is flown over the ice facility call it and talk about this unfortunately
[3:21:03.520 --> 3:21:08.800]  we're seeing now is the weather underground version the modern weather underground which is what
[3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:13.040]  antifa is turning into this is something that i predicted several years ago i hate to be right
[3:21:13.040 --> 3:21:18.240]  about that but i fear that the left now is going more and more kinetic and one thing to keep in
[3:21:18.240 --> 3:21:25.360]  mind is is that even if the powers that be don't want them to do this a lot of these radical cells
[3:21:25.360 --> 3:21:30.320]  that they have they have around the country are going to go and do what this man did vince bronson
[3:21:30.320 --> 3:21:35.680]  took it upon himself to go ahead and go full on kinetic using uh firearms and bombs and this is
[3:21:35.680 --> 3:21:42.880]  the great danger is that the rhetoric from omar and from aoc and others on the on the left all
[3:21:42.880 --> 3:21:48.320]  over cnn that these are concentration camps um that are that are actual concentration camps like
[3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:54.000]  nazi germany are going to inspire a lot of these radical leftists to go all the way and start killing
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:59.360]  people and now that they have you know across the threshold across the rubicon of having one of their
[3:21:59.360 --> 3:22:04.400]  own going kinetic they're holding him up as a martyr they're not they're not distancing distancing
[3:22:04.400 --> 3:22:09.360]  themselves from him and saying you know we don't we don't agree with this if the right has someone
[3:22:09.360 --> 3:22:14.320]  do something like this of course we all distance ourselves from them the left is the exact opposite
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:20.000]  you know they go around and then lot of him as as a martyr as an example to be followed so i expect
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:26.160]  more copycats or more radical leftists of the same mindset more radical communists to go ahead
[3:22:26.160 --> 3:22:30.800]  and start doing the same thing this is exactly we've seen throughout history the radical anarchist
[3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:36.480]  left the marxist anarchist left um loves to throw bombs and loves to you know set off explosives
[3:22:36.480 --> 3:22:41.840]  and assassinate people it's it's been done throughout history so my concern is is that
[3:22:41.840 --> 3:22:47.040]  any one of these people could snap and go and do it and next time be more competent potentially
[3:22:47.040 --> 3:22:51.040]  than this guy was thankfully this guy was not very competent and didn't actually kill anybody
[3:22:51.040 --> 3:22:55.760]  but imagine if they did kill someone then you would have a situation that could spiral out of
[3:22:55.760 --> 3:23:01.680]  control of the perception being that we're now in an open civil war and then you know one guy doing
[3:23:01.680 --> 3:23:06.880]  it doesn't doesn't quite do that but if you get a series of attacks that are deadly or increasingly
[3:23:06.880 --> 3:23:11.680]  more deadly you could wind up with people on the political right saying we have no choice now
[3:23:11.680 --> 3:23:16.800]  but they go hunt antifa down and make an open season on antifa so the question really is is
[3:23:16.800 --> 3:23:22.560]  what should president trump be doing about this um i believe what he should be doing is a declare
[3:23:22.560 --> 3:23:28.720]  get his department dhs and fbi to declare antifa a terrorist organization this attack right here
[3:23:28.720 --> 3:23:34.080]  and their response and their drum beat for more is enough to do that he should do that immediately
[3:23:34.080 --> 3:23:38.880]  uh put the lid on antifa and the second thing he should do also is to call up the national guard
[3:23:38.880 --> 3:23:43.600]  of origan for example and put them on streets of portland to keep the peace we have an upcoming
[3:23:43.600 --> 3:23:48.960]  event patriot event on august 17th that could turn into a powder keg if you have a continued
[3:23:48.960 --> 3:23:54.960]  pattern of the portland pd standing down at the orders of their mayor slash police commissioner
[3:23:54.960 --> 3:23:59.680]  who has told them not to interfere so it's a ticking time bomb and i think president trump
[3:23:59.680 --> 3:24:04.640]  must step in as a commander in chief and put a stop to it so let's take a caller let's go ahead
[3:24:04.640 --> 3:24:10.960]  and go with jim in indiana about accountability and for the terrorist attacks against ice hello jim
[3:24:10.960 --> 3:24:17.680]  how you doing good how are you sir excellent so what are your thoughts on this uh first of all
[3:24:17.680 --> 3:24:22.720]  thank you for your service and your continued service and god bless you and your family and show
[3:24:22.720 --> 3:24:31.200]  all those who stand up for you know america but uh about accountability it it you kind of stole my
[3:24:31.200 --> 3:24:38.480]  thunder with uh what you just said because uh every time i've heard you on the air you constantly say
[3:24:39.280 --> 3:24:45.440]  trump needs to start exercising his executive powers with commander in chief fully agree with that
[3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:50.880]  but there also has to be accountability across the board you start holding like you said uh
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:24:55.840]  label a materials group you'll see diminishing some of the useful idiots who are just going
[3:24:55.840 --> 3:25:02.480]  out there playing uh weekend avatar warrior or whatever but they have to start being held accountable
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:11.040]  these mayors and these politicians who openly uh disregard our laws you have complete lawlessness
[3:25:11.040 --> 3:25:16.320]  and they need to be held accountable i'm absolutely correct this is thing dr evan veer and i have
[3:25:16.320 --> 3:25:22.800]  both been saying for quite a long time is that there has to be an effort by the doj to investigate
[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:29.360]  and prosecute the sanctuary city and sanctuary county and sanctuary state officials who are
[3:25:29.360 --> 3:25:34.880]  doing all they can do one shelter antifa and two shelter the illegals and they're committing federal
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:40.560]  felonies and they shelter the illegal aliens exactly i mean you you have state officials
[3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:48.480]  and even local mayors who are are openly just now hey we're going to protect illegal aliens
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:54.160]  and not american citizens uh they should have been slot teamed they should have been perp rock
[3:25:54.160 --> 3:25:59.200]  and let out and say you know what you know it comes to a point where people have to start
[3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:05.360]  being held accountable because the american people are sick of it they're sick of watching people
[3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:13.120]  they'll stir through the ranger ops and it's i mean i i mean from the bottom up the people
[3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:20.160]  who support them financially you know it's right it's disgusting it's true well if they're if they
[3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:25.280]  are i mean i'm not i'm not a person who's in favor of of running around and declaring i mean you
[3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:29.040]  know god forbid that'd be done to us right this is the problem when we start declaring domestic
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:34.400]  groups uh terrorist groups but antifa fits the bill perfectly they openly advocate the use of force
[3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:40.560]  or the threatened use of force to coerce political outcomes to suppress speech and assembly and to
[3:26:40.560 --> 3:26:44.160]  crush their political opponents that is the definition of terrorism in the current federal
[3:26:44.160 --> 3:26:49.280]  statutes so it fits the bill perfectly and it's not just a an outlier here or there this is their
[3:26:49.280 --> 3:26:53.600]  constant drumbeat you go to some of the more popular sites like it's going down and they'll
[3:26:53.600 --> 3:26:57.120]  defend what they do is well it's not a violation of the first amendment because the first amendment
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:27:01.440]  only applies to the government so we can go ahead and suppress free speech all we want so they're
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:05.040]  openly telling you it's what they're doing when they go out in the streets and they do it in a very
[3:27:05.040 --> 3:27:11.840]  coordinated way the black block is designed to shelter assailants they all dress the same and
[3:27:11.840 --> 3:27:16.240]  they wear a mask so that one person can jump out and hit somebody in the head with a byclock for
[3:27:16.240 --> 3:27:21.840]  example or club and then fade back into this big block of of identity identify identically dressed
[3:27:21.840 --> 3:27:27.200]  people who are difficult to tell one from another that's how they hide inside that big black block
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:34.080]  well jim thanks for calling appreciate you very much let's go to david alaska about the ice attacks
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:39.680]  and about president trump go ahead david uh yes uh first of all i've been trying to call for years
[3:27:39.680 --> 3:27:45.200]  and the first time i got through and if you could pass on to alex that a spoke chair in alaska
[3:27:45.200 --> 3:27:49.120]  appreciate reshipping those things to be shipped out here costs more than the product
[3:27:51.760 --> 3:27:56.880]  in terms of how you feel and how the last caller feels i'm going to play a little bit of double
[3:27:56.880 --> 3:28:02.240]  advocate and i thought that way at first but i think that president trump knows a lot more than
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:08.720]  what you do he's got a lot of sources of information and i think that he has to go through the process
[3:28:09.280 --> 3:28:14.720]  of dot the eyes and crossing the t's where he's got to get a a rock solid case into these people
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:19.280]  because they have so much money so many good attorneys etc he was also new to the government
[3:28:19.280 --> 3:28:23.520]  and didn't know how the system works so he started off slow and i think it's getting
[3:28:23.520 --> 3:28:29.440]  better and better and i think that with time uh which is running out of course i think that he
[3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:34.160]  will get these you know bad guys i think that we will see people go to prison i think that we will
[3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:39.200]  see uh things happen and get well well my concern is the time is running out in fact time's running
[3:28:39.200 --> 3:28:54.160]  out on this call so thanks for calling in we'll get you on the other side thank you when you have

[3:31:57.840 --> 3:32:01.680]  but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five
[3:32:01.680 --> 3:32:05.760]  six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would
[3:32:05.760 --> 3:32:09.440]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have
[3:32:09.440 --> 3:32:13.600]  doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey
[3:32:13.600 --> 3:32:17.440]  we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements
[3:32:17.440 --> 3:32:20.320]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the left always has
[3:32:20.320 --> 3:32:26.080]  headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements and he claims her supplements no under
[3:32:26.080 --> 3:32:31.760]  federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they
[3:32:31.760 --> 3:32:35.760]  have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by
[3:32:35.760 --> 3:32:40.080]  them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it
[3:32:40.080 --> 3:32:44.080]  and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[3:32:44.080 --> 3:32:49.680]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info or store dot com or
[3:32:49.680 --> 3:33:10.400]  triple 82533139 you're listening to the alex jones show live from austin texas broadcasting
[3:33:10.400 --> 3:33:21.120]  worldwide it's alex jones the sturt roads fooling in for alex jones i'm talking to david molaska and
[3:33:21.120 --> 3:33:26.720]  david was bringing up a point uh that the president's got a plan he's surrounded by good advisors
[3:33:26.720 --> 3:33:31.040]  david unfortunately the problem is as as alex has been saying for quite a long time and myself as
[3:33:31.040 --> 3:33:35.840]  well um president trump is surrounded by deep state functionaries who are leftovers from the
[3:33:35.840 --> 3:33:41.600]  obama administration or they've been rhinos inside the gop for many years this is a sad truth so my
[3:33:41.600 --> 3:33:46.880]  concern is is that you know we have clear violations of federal law clear violations of federal felony
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:50.960]  statutes against harboring illegal aliens or committing the conspiracy of aiding and betting
[3:33:50.960 --> 3:33:55.680]  illegal aliens you've got clear obvious terrorism being committed by antifa um in fact you know the
[3:33:55.680 --> 3:34:00.320]  definition of terrorism today in federal statutes they can bring that real quick i'll read it to you
[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:05.840]  but it just it just lays out that it's it's the use of force the threatened use of force to coerce
[3:34:05.840 --> 3:34:10.800]  a political population the people themselves or the government that's exactly what's going on today
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:15.120]  and so you know it'd be nice if there was a plan but they're running we're running out of time so
[3:34:15.120 --> 3:34:21.520]  what do you say to that dave well i i do agree with you but if i was to switch gears a little bit
[3:34:21.520 --> 3:34:27.120]  and talk about the pedophilia situation you talk about the massive amount of arrest that
[3:34:27.120 --> 3:34:32.640]  have happened since he's been in office and now this out of the clear blue with ebbstein and ebbstein
[3:34:32.640 --> 3:34:39.440]  you know was kind of tied in with the uh i think cia and planning democrats and republicans and i
[3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:44.720]  think that these people are coerced into voting and doing certain things because it a lot of
[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:50.080]  things these people do even like chief justice roberts it makes zero sense and that's because
[3:34:50.080 --> 3:34:55.520]  there's a big guillotine over their head and i think that you know trump is slowly building the
[3:34:55.520 --> 3:35:00.560]  blocks get these people out yeah he's getting bad advice from some people there's a lot of bad guys
[3:35:00.560 --> 3:35:06.560]  his life's in jeopardy every day uh but i think that um he's moving forward but that's why he's
[3:35:06.560 --> 3:35:12.720]  got to get elected in 2020 to finish cleaning the house well he but i think you're right i think
[3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:17.200]  i think it's certainly true i think it's all you know commonly held belief among the people on
[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:21.200]  the political right now but it's very clear that that's how they do it it's the same thing that
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:26.160]  jagger hoover did like that's why he he stayed in the fbi until he died he had dossiers and
[3:35:26.160 --> 3:35:30.800]  everybody that's long before the internet long before high tech so yeah i think you're correct
[3:35:30.800 --> 3:35:34.560]  that's the only way to explain what justice roberts has been doing or others that they have
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:39.280]  they have something over them so it's very that's very true problem is though is the you know the
[3:35:39.280 --> 3:35:43.920]  idea that well you know he's got to get reelected in order to keep cleaning house that's probably
[3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:49.360]  what he thinks but the problem is is that he will have the election stolen out from underneath him
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:53.520]  you know and i watched the tucker carlson interview he did where tucker is trying to warn him that
[3:35:53.520 --> 3:35:57.280]  look you know google's going to get you there they're they're they're planning on and you know
[3:35:57.280 --> 3:36:02.160]  they've been exposed by project veritas as plotting your your political demise they're
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:06.320]  out to get you and he said well i beat them before i'll beat them again the thing is you know that
[3:36:06.320 --> 3:36:10.800]  was three years ago and by the time it comes election time before years later they have will
[3:36:10.800 --> 3:36:16.240]  have made sure they fix the problems that allowed trump to be elected in the first place my concern
[3:36:16.240 --> 3:36:21.920]  is because once he takes decisive action now to suppress the the insurrection by the radical
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:26.160]  left in particular to stop their planned vote fraud i think he'll have the election stolen
[3:36:26.160 --> 3:36:30.000]  from underneath him and he'll the clock will run out that'll be that that'll be the end of it well
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:33.760]  thanks to you for calling appreciate your phone your phone call now we're going to go to andy from
[3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:39.120]  missouri who wants to talk about how nihilism is taking over in place of american values how you
[3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:43.760]  doing andy hey pretty good how about yourself steward doing great so what are your thoughts on
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:52.240]  that let's talk to you yeah so what i want to talk about is american values and how we're slowly
[3:36:52.240 --> 3:36:59.200]  and mainly exponentially starting to lose the basic core traits that we have as americans
[3:37:00.400 --> 3:37:07.920]  to nihilistic worldview we've seen this happen before i mean hell i mean predritch even talked
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:16.640]  about this in the 1800s prior to the fall of the soviets and and germans um and how whenever you
[3:37:16.640 --> 3:37:22.000]  give up your values and in this case he talked about christianity which i feel it's still the same
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:27.040]  because we're kind of behold out here in america um that when you give that up that the void is
[3:37:27.040 --> 3:37:33.680]  filled by nihilism and what happens is when you lose your culture and you lose your roots and
[3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:38.480]  these bad things creep in you know the previous caller just talked about pedophilia you know and
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:43.520]  that's always been around right but it hasn't been accepted and there's many things now that are
[3:37:43.520 --> 3:37:48.720]  accepted that wouldn't have been a couple of decades ago what was the name of that one of the
[3:37:48.720 --> 3:37:55.280]  the um the factor from the kgb was urie who was his last name for him it was named but what's
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:38:01.920]  the president of besmanov right urie besmanov warned about this you can find the video on youtube
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:05.840]  back from the i think the 80s where he talked about this is the plan that was the plan of the
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:11.120]  soviet union was to demoralize americans destroy you know make them ignorant of their own history
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:15.520]  destroy the religious foundation and christianity you know in a sense of morals destroy their
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:20.160]  patriotism and just you know and then flood them with drugs and of course back then a lot of folks
[3:38:20.160 --> 3:38:24.320]  dismissed that as a conspiracy theory that's exactly what's what's been done that's what's being
[3:38:24.320 --> 3:38:29.280]  done now by domestic enemies of the constitution on the far left they are attacking because they
[3:38:29.280 --> 3:38:35.440]  believe that you know in marx's theory which is like their religion they believe that that mankind
[3:38:35.440 --> 3:38:40.720]  is simply an animal that there's no real inherent um you know divine spark that there's no such thing
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:45.840]  as as natural rights that all these are just man-made constructs so a lot of them sincerely believe
[3:38:45.840 --> 3:38:49.520]  that you can make people into whatever you want them to be you know multiple genders or whatever
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:54.560]  you want but the other side of it is is it's also their way of undermining and attacking our society
[3:38:54.560 --> 3:39:00.000]  and when you tie in the radical islamists they also loved to see this happen to the united states
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:05.120]  and to the west they want to see the christian faith eroded and destroyed they want to see you
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:11.840]  know any any concepts of of a higher power and a higher obligation and duty disappear because for
[3:39:11.840 --> 3:39:16.880]  them of course they have this ultimate goal of a caliphate it's a thousand-year plan if it takes
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:22.960]  that long they're fine with that and the radical left is very similar a marxist you know a communist
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:29.040]  like someone in antifa for them it's like a religion they see this as as their life's purpose
[3:39:29.040 --> 3:39:35.840]  is to do a long march and fulfill the revolution and so it's like marx is their version of of a la
[3:39:35.840 --> 3:39:41.200]  it's marx is their god and lenin and stalin those are the those are the prophets and that's why you'll
[3:39:41.200 --> 3:39:46.880]  see you know malice running around with chairman mal tattoos and flags but they worship lenin and
[3:39:46.880 --> 3:39:51.840]  stalin and mal even if you point out all their their mass murder they'll explain it away as being
[3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:55.840]  somehow the west fault or they'll deny it even happened i recently got in an argument with a
[3:39:55.840 --> 3:40:00.080]  communist on twitter who said that all you're talking about when i pointed out that you know
[3:40:00.080 --> 3:40:05.040]  upwards of 100 million people were killed by stalin and by mal and he says well you know that was the
[3:40:05.040 --> 3:40:09.840]  war dead from war one and little war two that's that's why so many soviets died and i'm not talking
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:14.160]  about war dead i'm talking about killed by their own government so you know it's it's kind of sad
[3:40:14.160 --> 3:40:19.760]  but that's what their their goal is is they replace the religion of christianity and and belief in
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:24.880]  natural rights that's that dominated the west and they replace that with with allegiance to mal
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:30.000]  and marx as you know the wave of the future you know post history and then and then radicals lamas
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:34.320]  is of course love this which is why they they coddle and get in bed with the radical leftist
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:39.200]  because they both are in agreement on one thing the west must be destroyed the united states must
[3:40:39.200 --> 3:40:44.160]  be destroyed our constitution must be destroyed and of course i believe that the these lamas
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:48.400]  look at all these radical leftists as useful idiots who believe that there's somehow going to be on
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:52.480]  top and in the end it's going to be the islamists on top because they have the harder faith
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:55.760]  is to your point well thank you very much and for calling in appreciate that
[3:40:56.560 --> 3:41:02.240]  let's go to brian from california um brian you're saying we need to start the war now
[3:41:02.240 --> 3:41:07.440]  while we have presidential support please explain what you mean by that well because what's going
[3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:12.880]  to happen is the second we lose the election they're going to say oh you're not you're not
[3:41:12.880 --> 3:41:21.120]  accepting the results and the left is going to have their you know ability to to resist and then
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:25.280]  we're going to have our ability to resist it's better to do it now when we have presidential
[3:41:25.280 --> 3:41:31.040]  support because once somebody else gets in it's going to be troops turned on us and
[3:41:31.840 --> 3:41:35.360]  well this is something i've actually said myself a few times and i want to make things very clear
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:41.440]  though i don't want to see a civil war in this country it'd be horrific um but if we're going to
[3:41:41.440 --> 3:41:46.800]  have one of the left is going to force us to fight which is what it's looking like it's going to be
[3:41:46.800 --> 3:41:52.320]  that i i agree with you it's better than it start under president trump which is why but the way
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:57.280]  to do it though is if they're going to have it then let them be the ones that start it as my
[3:41:57.280 --> 3:42:01.920]  late friend mike vanabeuil he would always say you know no fort sumpters make sure that you're
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:05.920]  on the defensive and you keep the moral high ground so i think the way to do that is for
[3:42:05.920 --> 3:42:10.400]  trump to be proactive and use his powers his commander and chief his constitutional powers
[3:42:10.400 --> 3:42:15.200]  to suppress the insurrection by the radical left by by by by antifa he should deploy the
[3:42:15.200 --> 3:42:19.600]  national guard in the streets of portland for example um or anywhere else that antifa is
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:24.000]  rising up and threatening to kill isis he should have national guardsmen federalized into into
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:29.280]  federal um service and posted at those ice facilities and let them attack the national guard
[3:42:29.280 --> 3:42:34.800]  that's how you want to start off if you're gonna have a fight yes but you know that's not gonna
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:39.280]  happen but we'll see i mean we can encourage the president to step up and and do his duty under
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:47.040]  his oath right well i mean it's up to us it is up to us but i guess up to us to prod him to do his
[3:42:47.040 --> 3:42:50.720]  duty that's what i think so i'll talk about that after the break very much thank you thank you for
[3:42:50.720 --> 3:42:57.040]  calling in stand by it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:43:02.080]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[3:43:02.080 --> 3:43:06.880]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[3:43:06.880 --> 3:43:10.800]  that's not being funded by secrets foreign government it is completely independent of all
[3:43:10.800 --> 3:43:16.480]  that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:20.640]  press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[3:43:20.640 --> 3:43:25.360]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:28.960]  this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[3:43:28.960 --> 3:43:33.120]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[3:43:33.120 --> 3:43:38.400]  control and manipulate what news it views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and
[3:43:38.400 --> 3:43:43.360]  the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to
[3:43:43.360 --> 3:43:47.760]  the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[3:43:47.760 --> 3:43:52.160]  onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you

[3:46:53.760 --> 3:47:04.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:24.640 --> 3:47:26.720]  hi
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:37.680]  i won't get you get what i'm after until the day i die okay this is stewart road is filling in
[3:47:37.680 --> 3:47:41.360]  for alex jones and i'm talking to brian from california you're having a rather interesting
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:46.800]  conversation where brian says we need to start the war now we have presidential support one thing
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:47:53.120]  i want to stress is that we have to remember the founding father's example they maintain the moral
[3:47:53.120 --> 3:47:58.000]  high ground while they prepared for battle they did all they could through the legal mechanisms
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:03.840]  available to them to petition the king and to correct the course um but they also got themselves
[3:48:03.840 --> 3:48:08.080]  squirt away and got their act together and prepared the battle space and that's kind of what we have
[3:48:08.080 --> 3:48:15.440]  to do too and of course they gave us tools to use in the we have not been using primary among them
[3:48:15.440 --> 3:48:20.480]  is the president's power as commander in chief one to seal the border with troops to stop the flow
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:25.040]  the influx of illegal aliens in our country which is what he needs to do this is something that
[3:48:25.040 --> 3:48:28.880]  dr evan veer and i have been talking about for quite a long time but the other one is and this
[3:48:28.880 --> 3:48:34.000]  goes back to brian's point i think is he also has the authority to call for the militia and that
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:38.080]  includes us there's the own organized militia that's all of us who are not in the national guard
[3:48:38.080 --> 3:48:42.960]  and then there's a so-called organized militia and so president trump certainly could call us up
[3:48:42.960 --> 3:48:47.840]  to go and execute the laws of the union and suppress the insurrection by the radical left
[3:48:47.840 --> 3:48:52.160]  and to repel the invasion down on the border he could do you know all those three things by calling
[3:48:52.160 --> 3:48:58.400]  us up so i agree with brian it is up to us but i think the first goal or first duty that we have
[3:48:58.400 --> 3:49:04.080]  is to remind the president and urge him to use his full authority as commander in chief his full
[3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:07.840]  constitutional authority and that's about martial law martial law is nowhere in the
[3:49:07.840 --> 3:49:13.360]  constitution it's not constitutional i'm talking about what the constitution article one section
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:18.160]  eight talks about calling for the militia force to suppress insurrections repel invasions and
[3:49:18.160 --> 3:49:24.640]  execute the laws of the union including our laws against terrorism for example with antifa
[3:49:24.640 --> 3:49:31.200]  so brian what i would encourage you to focus on is our responsibility to step up now and a defend
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:35.360]  i think we should all be standing outside of ice centers standing in solidarity with them
[3:49:35.360 --> 3:49:39.440]  to show them our support defending our flag and and also protecting people who are being
[3:49:39.440 --> 3:49:43.520]  attacked by antifa that's a known brand or something that we have done for years and other groups
[3:49:43.520 --> 3:49:48.320]  was done as well three percenters proud boys etc i think we need to do more of that but we need to
[3:49:48.320 --> 3:49:52.160]  do that with with discipline and say okay we're going to respect their right even though they're
[3:49:52.160 --> 3:49:57.280]  you know anti-american communists they were right to protest and right to free speech but
[3:49:57.280 --> 3:50:01.680]  as soon as they cross the line and the physical force we will stop them we will use force to stop
[3:50:01.680 --> 3:50:06.320]  force if we have to i think that's the best tactic to take while we encourage the president to stand
[3:50:06.320 --> 3:50:11.040]  up and use his authority as commander-in-chief over the national guard by putting on the streets
[3:50:11.040 --> 3:50:16.640]  important for example and then if he has to um also calling us up as the militia what do you say to
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:23.920]  that brian i agree and let me slow down a little bit i'm a former marine former law enforcement
[3:50:23.920 --> 3:50:28.720]  i'm an oath keeper i met you at berkeley i just i have to rattle everything off because alex has
[3:50:28.720 --> 3:50:33.840]  been giving me much chance are you at berkeley yes i was at berkeley i was the one that was
[3:50:33.840 --> 3:50:39.360]  protecting uh petty bomb oh yeah okay now i remember you you're uh actually you're young
[3:50:39.360 --> 3:50:45.920]  hispanic male right nope nope little white guy okay you're you were there with with another
[3:50:45.920 --> 3:50:49.760]  there was another guy there was there was hispanic okay we're good to go well tell us a little just
[3:50:49.760 --> 3:50:56.720]  tell folks about that experience uh that was uh interesting um you know when they you know when
[3:50:56.720 --> 3:51:03.040]  they throw dumpsters at you and uh the very first explosion went off a foot in front of me and right
[3:51:03.040 --> 3:51:09.920]  between somebody's feet right in front of me that day uh i got hit by a lead pipe i got hit by two
[3:51:09.920 --> 3:51:16.800]  explosives uh you got hit by what he tried to hit their bike what you know you know they were throwing
[3:51:16.800 --> 3:51:22.640]  that the bombs that day right they're throwing the m80s right yeah yeah yeah i got hit by two of those
[3:51:24.160 --> 3:51:27.040]  and someone who chose a lead pipe i didn't even hear about that tell us about that
[3:51:27.040 --> 3:51:34.480]  yeah he he was uh uh a uh probably a 16 year old black male running around with like a uh you know it
[3:51:34.480 --> 3:51:40.000]  was probably like you know those pipes that you uh run conduit through there's about seven feet long
[3:51:40.000 --> 3:51:45.520]  and you like whipped it up and came right down on my collarbone almost broke it wow so you were one
[3:51:45.520 --> 3:51:52.800]  of the guys that were there out on the very front line that day yes i was up there with uh yeah all
[3:51:52.800 --> 3:51:56.400]  the you know the guys and they were throwing the dumpster around everything yeah right well thank you
[3:51:56.400 --> 3:52:00.720]  for being there appreciate you very much and how are things now are you still in berkeley
[3:52:02.080 --> 3:52:09.840]  i'm in richmond california right now and how are things there right now oh man california is going
[3:52:09.840 --> 3:52:17.200]  down and the second attack industry gets hammered by by trump hopefully and they collapse this area
[3:52:17.200 --> 3:52:22.800]  is going to descend into complete chaos because you're talking about the false economy of the
[3:52:22.800 --> 3:52:28.640]  bay area where you take the 49 other state tax taxes right grants the billions of dollars
[3:52:28.640 --> 3:52:35.120]  couldn't concentrate them all in the bay area once that goes away it's it's going to be complete
[3:52:35.120 --> 3:52:40.960]  mayhem here now i know a lot of folks who are patriot minded are starting to flee california
[3:52:40.960 --> 3:52:45.440]  there's a mass exodus is that something that you're thinking about doing is your position
[3:52:45.440 --> 3:52:52.640]  you're going to stay there and and take a stand uh i mean if i could flee i would i just don't
[3:52:52.640 --> 3:52:58.800]  have the resources now one reminder for a lot of the folks is that california is still about
[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:04.240]  what is it 35 or 40 percent conservative it's just that you've been tipped over on to the other side
[3:53:04.240 --> 3:53:09.920]  but there's still quite a few patriotic americans who live in california and we should not uh should
[3:53:09.920 --> 3:53:16.880]  not give up on them it's 60 percent it's 60 conservative here i mean the the greatest
[3:53:16.880 --> 3:53:25.360]  conservative president ever you know besides trump uh uh reagan came from here i i've been in seven
[3:53:25.360 --> 3:53:32.640]  militia all across california and let me just say they know how to deal with the bay area
[3:53:32.640 --> 3:53:38.320]  so you so do you think it's vote fraud that is that has allowed the democrats to flip california
[3:53:38.320 --> 3:53:45.200]  blue or what's what how do you explain that it's it's population uh condensation or condensing
[3:53:45.200 --> 3:53:51.360]  and with the voter fraud absolutely okay what are your final thoughts you want to you want to tell
[3:53:51.360 --> 3:53:55.520]  from from occupied territory in california any final thoughts you want to tell the folks out there
[3:53:57.040 --> 3:54:03.760]  uh yeah um alex you want to really make a lot of money when somebody donates
[3:54:04.400 --> 3:54:10.480]  a hundred two hundred five hundred a thousand dollars you send them a unique shirt and sticker
[3:54:10.480 --> 3:54:16.960]  they can put on their car that says i contributed this much you will get thousands of people to
[3:54:16.960 --> 3:54:23.040]  contribute to get that thousand like a like a top you can probably open what oh go ahead
[3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:29.760]  you know and i was saying here here's a great concept think of this you're you're you're selling
[3:54:29.760 --> 3:54:36.000]  tubes of toothpaste for five dollars and getting a dollar right what if you just opened the info
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:42.560]  wars bank interesting every single patriot that was removed from every single bank and they put
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:48.880]  ten thousand dollars into you you would have so much power to destroy them through your own power
[3:54:48.880 --> 3:54:54.480]  of the money that you have consolidated with the conservatives you would you wouldn't stop well
[3:54:55.520 --> 3:54:59.280]  interesting idea well thanks for calling in and you'd be safe out there god bless you
[3:54:59.280 --> 3:55:09.600]  okay let's go to carl from texas um carl go ahead thanks a lot uh just do it doing a great job
[3:55:10.800 --> 3:55:16.960]  the the products are are fantastic um i was in the arms of 30 years a little older man as you
[3:55:16.960 --> 3:55:22.560]  could imagine and without those products i wouldn't have the quality of life that i have so
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:26.880]  i really appreciate that awesome which ones which ones are you using right now
[3:55:26.880 --> 3:55:35.680]  well the bone broth is real good and uh i use uh you know the the fusion i mean i go through the
[3:55:35.680 --> 3:55:42.800]  list i mean i use most at most everything the the red pill is fantastic it's got the preglonon in
[3:55:42.800 --> 3:55:50.400]  it it helps the back and how old are you i'm 66 and you feel you feel your quality of life has
[3:55:50.400 --> 3:55:56.720]  gone up since you've been using these products oh yes absolutely good good to hear yeah would you
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:56:04.160]  want to call in about well you know the christians had a thing years ago that i was involved with
[3:56:04.160 --> 3:56:11.040]  us called promise keepers right what they would do is they would they contract uh sports arena and
[3:56:11.040 --> 3:56:16.560]  they invite christians to come a lot of churches were involved in that and they would send christians
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:23.360]  and they had a wonderful conference well i think info warriors and a lot of patriots don't have
[3:56:23.360 --> 3:56:28.960]  the venue to to go and and to meet like-minded people i mean just having a t-shirt and walking
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:35.200]  around town that that's not that's not good enough so my idea is is that if you could get the
[3:56:36.160 --> 3:56:41.760]  the old keepers the info lawyers and even you know the three percenters whatever
[3:56:42.320 --> 3:56:48.080]  patriot organizations that were vetted and wanted to participate you could have you could get a
[3:56:48.080 --> 3:56:55.120]  stadium and have people and you could you could even charge you know uh and have a large conference
[3:56:55.120 --> 3:57:01.200]  where where patriots can meet one another it could be like a movement and it's and something that uh
[3:57:02.400 --> 3:57:06.880]  plus you know you could use it as a mobilization effort where where people could really understand
[3:57:06.880 --> 3:57:12.000]  what your organizations are about how they could get involved that's a good that's a good idea we've
[3:57:12.000 --> 3:57:17.040]  been to the hear the washman conference um which has been in in dallas texas for a few years and
[3:57:17.040 --> 3:57:20.400]  other places in the country but sure that's actually a pretty good idea it'd be kind of
[3:57:20.400 --> 3:57:24.640]  nice to have an info warrior slash two percenter oath keeper conference thanks for thanks for the
[3:57:24.640 --> 3:57:30.640]  suggestion appreciate that very much god bless you okay till the end of the side we'll talk to

[3:57:49.520 --> 3:57:57.040]  harness science took to the skies and soared into the heavens because we will never forget
[3:57:57.040 --> 3:58:10.320]  that we are americans and the future belongs to us the future belongs to the brave the strong the

[3:58:35.920 --> 3:58:39.440]  full power damn the torpedoes go straight at him
[3:58:44.080 --> 3:58:46.800]  let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding
[3:58:46.800 --> 3:58:51.280]  hey alec yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people
[3:58:51.280 --> 3:58:55.840]  here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these
[3:58:55.840 --> 3:59:00.320]  wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because
[3:59:00.320 --> 3:59:04.560]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the
[3:59:04.560 --> 3:59:09.040]  approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[3:59:09.040 --> 3:59:12.880]  the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my
[3:59:12.880 --> 3:59:16.640]  friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alec is i know they're trying to shut
[3:59:16.640 --> 3:59:21.760]  you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80
[3:59:21.760 --> 3:59:25.840]  years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down
[3:59:25.840 --> 3:59:31.600]  no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself
[3:59:31.600 --> 3:59:35.760]  and many others who are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the info war and even
[3:59:35.760 --> 3:59:40.720]  if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
