[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:36.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.920 --> 00:45.440]  ladies and gentlemen here we are already the eighth day of April 2014 next
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.520]  week everybody gets to pay the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve via their
[00:50.520 --> 00:55.600]  collection agency set up the same year in 1913 the Federal Reserve you get to
[00:55.600 --> 01:00.640]  pay your quote income tax every red cent of it goes to national debt created by
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.080]  the globalist not even paying off the debt this is how you take the greatest
[01:05.080 --> 01:10.040]  creditor nation and make it the greatest debtor nation in world history and I've
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.160]  got reports here today where most people that thought they would retire when they
[01:14.160 --> 01:19.560]  hit 65 aren't the new retirement age is gonna be 77 years old which also just so
[01:19.560 --> 01:24.360]  happens to be the average year you die so you're not going to ever be getting
[01:24.360 --> 01:28.280]  that social security you're not gonna get any of it until we kick the global
[01:28.280 --> 01:32.840]  astound because they will create enough debt to always make the general public
[01:32.840 --> 01:39.120]  debtors it is a kleptocratic anti-free market system we've got a big stack of
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.200]  news on that front I will be getting to also Paul Watson reported on this
[01:43.200 --> 01:48.760]  yesterday it's in the news Jay Z's bling from whites or devils group addresses
[01:48.760 --> 01:54.000]  Illuminati and questions of other religions and of course they just do
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.120]  this to look mysterious and powerful and the rest of it the truth is the
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.800]  Illuminati was just a German death cult that was able to overthrow the French
[02:06.800 --> 02:10.720]  monarchs and set up the French Revolution tried to take over our
[02:10.720 --> 02:15.000]  revolution but failed and George Washington blocked it and it's just
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.560]  standard you know establishment peons trying to look like they're part of you
[02:21.560 --> 02:26.960]  know the the inner circle of the New World Order I will assure you that even
[02:26.960 --> 02:33.160]  groups like the Rolling Stones and the Beatles and certainly Jay Z are not in
[02:33.160 --> 02:38.520]  the inner circle or even in the real Illuminati there are lots of fake kind
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.840]  of outside groups that I mean I see these articles all the time where guys
[02:42.840 --> 02:47.080]  tell women I'm in the Illuminati have sex with me and I'll let you into it like
[02:47.080 --> 02:51.200]  that's a very popular pickup line it was reported on all over the press last year
[02:51.200 --> 02:58.240]  to tell women that you're that you're part of the secret Illuminati society
[02:58.240 --> 03:03.920]  and that the only way to experience true Valhalla is to jump in the sack with
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.280]  them and it's basically more of that in a society where everybody wants to feel
[03:08.280 --> 03:15.520]  important and powerful and even much of the power structure itself is enamored
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.800]  though with Hollywood I'm not saying Hollywood music doesn't have power but
[03:19.800 --> 03:26.280]  when you look at a Bill Clinton or George W. Bush Clinton especially like to
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.000]  hang around with Hollywood people Bill Clinton was only a mid-level minion of
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.240]  the globalist in fact if you go to DrudgeReport.com you can see a photo up
[03:34.240 --> 03:38.640]  there of Bush and Clinton together they've got that big fraudulent charity
[03:38.640 --> 03:43.600]  together and they're up there with Jerry Jones and they're also up there with
[03:43.600 --> 03:49.760]  Laura Bush and you see all the other narcissists around them so proud of
[03:49.760 --> 03:55.280]  the fact that they're sitting there with two presidents and that they're all on
[03:55.280 --> 04:01.520]  TV that those smiles on all those people's faces is the look of total
[04:01.520 --> 04:05.440]  mental illness and being the parrot that's sitting at the top of the tree I
[04:05.440 --> 04:12.960]  would be embarrassed to be sitting there with those criminals number one even
[04:12.960 --> 04:16.600]  if I was sitting there with famous people I admired it would be embarrassing to be
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.840]  the center of attention the whole issue is sometimes you've got to be the center
[04:22.840 --> 04:27.440]  of the attention to get things done but as you develop you're supposed to be
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.080]  narcissistic as a child to develop your own personality but that's supposed to
[04:32.080 --> 04:37.080]  fall away later with the ruling establishment they are a bunch of
[04:37.080 --> 04:44.480]  mindless narcissists themselves until you get to the very very technocratic top
[04:44.480 --> 04:48.720]  of people like Rosinski and David Rockefeller and folks they could care
[04:48.720 --> 04:52.960]  less about being in the limelight they want to creep around pulling the levers
[04:52.960 --> 04:57.760]  of social control that's what they crave real power not the reflection of it
[04:57.760 --> 05:02.480]  we'll be back the globalist social engineers are not just targeting us
[05:02.480 --> 05:07.040]  with propaganda they are manipulating our genetics we are being targeted at

[09:14.960 --> 09:19.200]  lot of courage that's why she's been demonized on so many fronts Cynthia
[09:19.200 --> 09:24.280]  McKinney will be joining us to talk about Russia to talk about the economy to
[09:24.280 --> 09:29.360]  talk about Obama and the real Cynthia McKinney is different than what the
[09:29.360 --> 09:33.840]  controlled right-wing press basically says about her doesn't mean I agree with
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.200]  her on everything I agree with on her about 80% of things but I know she's a
[09:37.200 --> 09:42.600]  real person I've met her I got the project censored awards years ago out
[09:42.600 --> 09:47.240]  in California in San Francisco and she was there also getting an award had a
[09:47.240 --> 09:51.200]  chance to hang out with her and have dinner a real person just like I don't
[09:51.200 --> 09:54.280]  totally agree with Jesse Ventura on every front but I know he's a real person
[09:54.280 --> 09:59.440]  so I admire that and I see how he's been demonized and so she's going to be
[09:59.440 --> 10:05.120]  joining us you can actually hear from Cynthia McKinney herself and why both
[10:05.120 --> 10:09.880]  the Democrat and Republican Party came after her she was replaced in her state
[10:09.880 --> 10:14.240]  of Georgia with the congressman that thinks that Guam and other islands are
[10:14.240 --> 10:18.800]  floating and then if you allow development hotels on one side it will
[10:18.800 --> 10:26.840]  cause the the the island to capsize you heard me right she she was basically
[10:26.840 --> 10:31.080]  removed and in the establishment both parties installed with massive funding
[10:31.080 --> 10:36.000]  and promotion a man who thinks islands are floating doesn't know that the tips
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.480]  of mountains I mean I know we're in a country where the government teaches
[10:40.480 --> 10:44.520]  two plus two equals five but ladies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you
[10:44.520 --> 10:50.520]  continents and islands are not floating now the continents technically are
[10:50.520 --> 10:55.280]  floating on lava so I guess in a way they are floating maybe he's right maybe
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.160]  I'm wrong maybe maybe two plus two does equal five or ten or whatever they say
[10:59.160 --> 11:08.160]  the point is we are live on this Tuesday 8th day of April 2014 and there is a
[11:08.160 --> 11:13.000]  huge amount of just incredibly important news from the economy to sagebrush
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.440]  rebellions blooming out in the west with new ruby ridge type situations that
[11:18.440 --> 11:23.280]  could unfold that's all up on info wars com we're going to be breaking it all
[11:23.280 --> 11:27.960]  down today but first off I just wanted to give thanks here on air today for a
[11:27.960 --> 11:32.720]  great crew the best crew I've ever had that's getting better and better and I
[11:32.720 --> 11:36.400]  think overall I'm getting more focused and more professional and just the
[11:36.400 --> 11:39.360]  entire team we've got here is a blessing from God I want to thank God for
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.560]  that and I want to thank my heavenly father for our listeners and supporters
[11:43.560 --> 11:47.000]  that don't stand behind us you stand right beside us and in front of us
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.120]  we're all in this together and this is really a off-the-chart important quest
[11:52.120 --> 11:57.920]  that we're all on together this is really a big deal and the fact that info
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.480]  wars is so prominent and it's been so rag tag but it still had this big of an
[12:02.480 --> 12:08.320]  effect is really awe-inspiring and that's why I'm so humbled because I don't
[12:08.320 --> 12:18.520]  feel like I live up to the incredible office that God has put me in and I just
[12:18.520 --> 12:24.440]  see our influence increasing by the millisecond and quite frankly it is a
[12:24.440 --> 12:31.000]  daunting task quite frankly it is the opposite of a narcissistic power trip to
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.360]  realize that the attacks will intensify the co-intel pro will intensify the
[12:35.360 --> 12:40.320]  cash-sunstein cognitive infiltration is going to intensify the fraud is going to
[12:40.320 --> 12:44.280]  intensify by the enemies at the highest levels of the global crime syndicate
[12:44.280 --> 12:49.240]  right down to the grassroots because we are over the target and we're getting
[12:49.240 --> 12:55.000]  the major flak because we have analyzed the enemy attack profile correctly we
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.160]  have documented their real program their real system their real philosophy
[13:01.160 --> 13:09.320]  their modus operandi and we are now decompartmentalizing the planet the
[13:09.320 --> 13:12.320]  planet's already gotten the point of being ready to decompartmentalize but
[13:12.320 --> 13:17.880]  like an enzyme a tiny amount of enzyme can cause a chain reaction in an entire
[13:17.880 --> 13:28.600]  system info wars I now recognize is an absolutely key key piece of data in the
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.920]  overall structure it is quite literally a key everything we've done the organic
[13:33.920 --> 13:39.200]  structure of this operation the fact that other people are compartmentalized
[13:39.200 --> 13:44.960]  and don't understand the larger system it's really a blessing to know that we
[13:44.960 --> 13:49.840]  do know the truth we do know the enemy program and the public more and more is
[13:49.840 --> 13:54.920]  prepared to listen to us and then see for themselves because it's just like
[13:54.920 --> 13:58.280]  they live you take the glasses off you don't see what's happening you put the
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.920]  glasses on you see the world for what it really is or the allegory of the
[14:01.920 --> 14:08.880]  matrix you take the red pill and the real world gets revealed you take the
[14:08.880 --> 14:13.040]  blue pill and you stay in wonderland well people are gonna be forced to take
[14:13.040 --> 14:17.880]  the red pill because this is the cycle of decadence and corruption that we're
[14:17.880 --> 14:25.600]  going into and human survival is now on the line our entire species future is
[14:25.600 --> 14:30.640]  now on the line and everyone instinctively can feel that and the
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.760]  establishment tries to take all that instinctive anxiety that people are
[14:34.760 --> 14:39.840]  feeling and they try to put it into support of the system the system says
[14:39.840 --> 14:43.920]  oh you're having anxiety here's pills or you're having anxiety go with the
[14:43.920 --> 14:49.000]  system or you're having anxiety by into the system or you're having anxiety by
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.360]  into these celebrities you're having anxiety by more into entertainment more
[14:53.360 --> 14:58.800]  into decadence more into being selfish more into being a liar more into being
[14:58.800 --> 15:04.880]  delusional there is a spirit of great delusion being poured out upon the land
[15:04.880 --> 15:08.080]  but at the same time for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
[15:08.080 --> 15:12.240]  to quotes Sir Isaac Newton and then later of course the great physicist
[15:12.240 --> 15:20.440]  Einstein Albert Einstein for this great reaction of evil for this great mountain
[15:20.440 --> 15:27.560]  of evil rising up out of the sea there is a huge counteraction happening and at
[15:27.560 --> 15:33.320]  the very highest levels of the system in propaganda entertainment government
[15:33.320 --> 15:39.480]  religion people really are now seeing that goodness is the way to go it's
[15:39.480 --> 15:43.600]  only when evil completely starts to take over that people realize that goodness
[15:43.600 --> 15:51.200]  is like a warm birth in a ship in the middle of a frozen sea of death when
[15:51.200 --> 15:56.320]  things are good in societies virtuous it can become its own tyranny to those
[15:56.320 --> 16:02.280]  that don't understand history and so the allure of rebellion and wickedness
[16:02.280 --> 16:09.000]  against good looks very sexy but once you're in the bondage of evil then you
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.480]  look back and see that liberty is actually a free country liberty is a
[16:15.480 --> 16:25.080]  oasis in a world of barbarism and dishonor honor and truthfulness is the
[16:25.080 --> 16:32.480]  very blood of a free safe and happy civilization and society and I see the
[16:32.480 --> 16:38.480]  amount of dishonor growing or the amount of people just completely
[16:38.480 --> 16:43.640]  disconnected from reality and hooked into entertainment and mindlessness and I
[16:43.640 --> 16:48.640]  really am concerned for these people because they have no idea the type of
[16:48.640 --> 16:53.160]  world they're going into I see so many well-meaning yuppies so many well-meaning
[16:53.160 --> 17:01.000]  professionals so many overall good people who are freaked out scared and
[17:01.000 --> 17:10.440]  grasping at different societal frauds different societal pipe dreams believing
[17:10.440 --> 17:14.280]  it will fulfill them if they can just be a rock star if they can just be a rap
[17:14.280 --> 17:18.920]  star if they could just be a movie star if they could just be a sports star as
[17:18.920 --> 17:25.440]  if those were the only avenues to success in life success in life is being
[17:25.440 --> 17:32.000]  fulfilled yourself in the act of creation the act of literature art raising
[17:32.000 --> 17:38.280]  children cooking a good meal having good friends having a good laugh believing
[17:38.280 --> 17:44.880]  in yourself that is what is going to fulfill you loving God loving justice
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.880]  is what is going to fulfill you not loving the completely narcissistic
[17:50.880 --> 18:01.720]  soulless completely empty folks that are a bunch of haughty pompous know-it-alls
[18:01.720 --> 18:05.960]  I mean you run into the country club types who stick their nose up in the
[18:05.960 --> 18:11.520]  ear to make you feel small so they feel good what incredible losers those
[18:11.520 --> 18:16.680]  people are completely scared completely freaked out about what's going on in the

[24:08.760 --> 24:13.360]  alright ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here back live let's get into the story
[24:13.360 --> 24:19.200]  from the Washington Free Beacon up on drudgereport.com and infowars.com
[24:19.200 --> 24:25.600]  Holder we want to explore gun tracking bracelets DOJ requesting 2 million for
[24:25.600 --> 24:29.240]  gun safety technology grants we're gonna play a clip of that in a moment and then
[24:29.240 --> 24:33.480]  dovetail it with another report the dealing with taser bracelets they want
[24:33.480 --> 24:36.680]  you to wear to be able to fly you heard me right Homeland Security is actually
[24:36.680 --> 24:41.200]  having meetings on that for at least two and a half years we broke the story back
[24:41.200 --> 24:49.480]  in 2012 coming next TSA electric shock bracelets but remember California just
[24:49.480 --> 24:53.640]  put out a business most manufacturers there because of micro stamping on the
[24:53.640 --> 24:58.480]  firing pins which basically makes them have to retool their entire factories
[24:58.480 --> 25:02.920]  and you're seeing the move towards biometric guns and and systems that
[25:02.920 --> 25:06.200]  they can electronically knock out and they're gonna try to make all the other
[25:06.200 --> 25:11.600]  guns obsolete and illegal so this is just outrageous but you know Holder's goal
[25:11.600 --> 25:18.320]  is civilian disarmament under the unideer UN treaty that says quote civilian
[25:18.320 --> 25:23.000]  ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.760]  that statement is totally true except for one word legitimate there is nothing
[25:27.760 --> 25:31.960]  legitimate about a power monopoly of the state unless your Dennis Rodman hanging
[25:31.960 --> 25:39.800]  out with that narcissistic degenerate sycophant Kim Jong-un Kim Jong-un I mean
[25:39.800 --> 25:44.680]  give me a break and again you see the narcissistic photos of Kim Jong-un and
[25:44.680 --> 25:48.760]  the video of him and Dennis Rodman and all the crazy sycophants staring and
[25:48.760 --> 25:53.680]  smiling to be with him on TV at the basketball court you could not pay me a
[25:53.680 --> 25:58.800]  billion dollars to go over there and hang around with Kim Jong-un actually I
[25:58.800 --> 26:03.040]  would take the billion and try to use it to overthrow the North Korean
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.760]  government the point is is that it's just ridiculous and folks I've been there
[26:08.760 --> 26:12.840]  I've been there in the bleachers with the coolest people in America and it's
[26:12.840 --> 26:18.000]  empty I just keep harping on that because even the dictator of North Korea
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.480]  is obsessed and so disconnected he thinks the wash up washed up a decade ago
[26:23.480 --> 26:32.920]  Dennis Rodman who sounds like Soros talking I mean he thinks that's cool
[26:32.920 --> 26:39.320]  ladies and gentlemen I've hung out with Carmen Electra I guess that's a little
[26:39.320 --> 26:44.320]  bit cooler but that wasn't too cool she was nice the whole point is ladies and
[26:44.320 --> 26:49.840]  gentlemen is that who cares who cares it's sick now let's go to the guy that
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.000]  wants your guns who wants to ban all the other guns and make you wear a
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.840]  biometric bracelet for your gun to work this is insane and they'll first make
[26:58.840 --> 27:03.160]  cops do it watch just like they put GPS in the cop cars first and it's gonna be
[27:03.160 --> 27:06.840]  everybody they first abuse the enforcers then they abuse everybody else
[27:06.840 --> 27:10.880]  because well I gotta do it you gotta do it this is how they're coming after the
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.440]  guns folks regulatorally outside of law here is the enemy of fast and furious
[27:16.440 --> 27:21.920]  Benghazi cover up everything this is the false flag master who covered up
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.000]  Oklahoma City in federal court documents here he is wanting you to wear a
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.320]  bracelet a meeting with a group of technology people and talked about how
[27:31.320 --> 27:36.040]  guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint
[27:36.040 --> 27:40.480]  identification the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might
[27:40.480 --> 27:46.960]  wear how guns can be used only by the person who was lawfully in possession
[27:46.960 --> 27:51.040]  of of the way smart guns it's those kinds of things that I think we want to
[27:51.040 --> 27:55.320]  try to just like smart meters and smart phones the whole tie your gun into the
[27:55.320 --> 28:01.360]  NSA basically that's it now let's go to the company that has had meetings with
[28:01.360 --> 28:04.120]  Homeland Security Homeland Security said in briefings were linked to in the
[28:04.120 --> 28:10.960]  article that they would like to adopt this the lampard less lethal ink taser
[28:10.960 --> 28:15.720]  bracelet to fly by the way I want to send man on the street out to ask people
[28:15.720 --> 28:19.720]  if they would wear a shock bracelet for everyone's safety for Obama I want to
[28:19.720 --> 28:25.200]  send the reporters out send out Macadoo send out maybe McBreen he's been with
[28:25.200 --> 28:28.440]  the graphics guy doesn't credible graphics but maybe McBreen should go out
[28:28.440 --> 28:31.320]  and ask folks about the telly taser bracelet fact that's it send McBreen
[28:31.320 --> 28:36.440]  out now let's go to part of this clip with the taser bracelet here it is by
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.280]  further equipping each bracelet with EMD technology the bracelets will allow
[28:41.280 --> 28:46.040]  crew members using radio frequency transmitters to quickly and effectively
[28:46.040 --> 28:51.720]  subdue hijackers the electro muscular disruption signal oh it's the attacker's
[28:51.720 --> 28:55.680]  central nervous system and will render even the most elite and aggressive
[28:55.680 --> 29:00.560]  terrorist completely immobile for several minutes this will allow the crew
[29:00.560 --> 29:07.400]  to subdue and handcuff that individual EMD technology is designed to incapacitate
[29:07.400 --> 29:12.320]  a target from a safe distance without causing permanent injury which means
[29:12.320 --> 29:18.360]  these criminals will survive and go to trial the bracelet would only be armed
[29:18.360 --> 29:25.040]  by someone on board upon confirmation that a takeover situation exists to a
[29:25.040 --> 29:29.320]  businessman on his way home to be reunited with his family or to a young
[29:29.320 --> 29:33.880]  family going south for a winter holiday wearing an EMDC we're gonna go to break

[35:10.720 --> 35:16.400]  pushing Catholic priests being murdered and churches being blown up on a daily
[35:16.400 --> 35:22.480]  basis there's new articles on that today out of Syria famed Jesuit priests
[35:22.480 --> 35:26.720]  abducted beaten and executed in Syria that's out of mclatchy this is a daily
[35:26.720 --> 35:34.120]  basis by Western funded US government funded al-Qaeda and then they want you
[35:34.120 --> 35:37.920]  to wear a taser bracelet because you might be al-Qaeda notice they said the
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.400]  terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom that's actually true the
[35:42.400 --> 35:46.480]  globalists have funded radical Islam they have protected radical Islam they
[35:46.480 --> 35:52.840]  have done all of this so that they can take over countries that are westernizing
[35:52.840 --> 35:55.800]  and that are a threat to globalist hegemony they could knock countries
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.200]  back to the Stone Age they could destroy multicultural multi-religious areas like
[36:00.200 --> 36:07.160]  Syria Egypt Libya you name it and put in Saudi Arabian psycho jihadis and by the
[36:07.160 --> 36:11.120]  way Paul Watson's been writing articles by the feminist groups are saying men
[36:11.120 --> 36:16.120]  shouldn't be able to be fathers and all sexes rape and saying the word bossy is
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.360]  evil and all this other stuff will not criticize Saudi Arabia where they
[36:20.360 --> 36:24.640]  execute women if they get caught driving basically and then I noticed
[36:24.640 --> 36:30.680]  radical Muslims on info wars.com saying how dare you demonize Islam by
[36:30.680 --> 36:35.480]  reporting on this listen I'm not Islamophobic I don't hate Muslims I'm
[36:35.480 --> 36:38.960]  against all these illegal wars I'm against turning al-Qaeda loose in all
[36:38.960 --> 36:45.200]  these countries and overthrowing them but Saudi Arabia is funding Hollywood it's
[36:45.200 --> 36:49.400]  funding the media it owns part of Fox News the government of Saudi Arabia does
[36:49.400 --> 36:55.680]  look it up they own part of CNN the Chinese government's influence on our
[36:55.680 --> 37:02.400]  media no one will criticize Saudi Arabia but they'll say if I like to wear the
[37:02.400 --> 37:10.320]  pants around the house I'm some kind of sexist pig well let me tell you something
[37:10.320 --> 37:13.960]  women like you to wear the pants men that's why most human get thrown to the
[37:13.960 --> 37:19.000]  curb the truth is everything they sell to women out there has been to destroy
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.760]  women and if men would start wearing the pants again in this country we wouldn't
[37:23.760 --> 37:28.400]  be slaves ruled by the government and the media and the propagandized brainwashed
[37:28.400 --> 37:36.560]  population men have absolutely turned the world over to the corrupt men that
[37:36.560 --> 37:41.320]  run the New World Order and believe me it's a man's world there's articles out
[37:41.320 --> 37:47.120]  about the worst payment inequity between men and women in the White House ever
[37:47.120 --> 37:55.240]  well of course who do you think runs the White House men it's all a bunch of
[37:55.240 --> 38:00.360]  talk to get men and women fighting with each other down at the grassroots level
[38:01.400 --> 38:06.960]  because there's a war on women a war on men a war on the family last month we
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.720]  had the war on men this month the magazine is the modern Marilyn the war on
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.200]  women next month's issue is the war on children and the family and you take
[38:15.200 --> 38:23.120]  these three magazines together you've got a 68 68 68 we're talking about almost a
[38:23.120 --> 38:33.840]  200-page book a 200-page book of the war on humanity scientifically big
[38:33.840 --> 38:38.560]  pharma this is like an alien species coming to the planet and putting
[38:38.560 --> 38:42.360]  clones down generationally to take over the government and now they're in
[38:42.360 --> 38:46.520]  control this is what an alien species would do if it wanted to quietly without
[38:46.520 --> 38:51.480]  a bunch of fuss exterminate humanity you would incrementally sterilize people you
[38:51.480 --> 38:54.920]  would incrementally soft kill the population you would dumb them down you
[38:54.920 --> 39:00.440]  would destroy their values you would domesticate you would annihilate and I'm
[39:00.440 --> 39:08.400]  not saying it's space aliens you know the watchers from from the kyber belt all
[39:08.400 --> 39:13.800]  I'm saying is that it might as well be that that's the level of what you're
[39:13.800 --> 39:19.920]  facing and you're designed as a human to face threats you're designed as a human
[39:19.920 --> 39:26.040]  to thrive when you're under attack and you recognize the enemy it makes you
[39:26.040 --> 39:28.960]  stronger Nietzsche was right that which does not kill you only makes you
[39:28.960 --> 39:35.040]  stronger if you're aware of the attack and persevere through it but if you
[39:35.040 --> 39:39.840]  adapt to the attack and give into it there's a bad type of adaptation and
[39:39.840 --> 39:43.560]  you you learn to live with the incremental slavery you will finally
[39:43.560 --> 39:50.520]  fade away and be destroyed so imagine in the land of the free in the home of
[39:50.520 --> 39:56.960]  the brave they want you to wear a bracelet to have a gun your smart meter
[39:56.960 --> 40:02.600]  put on forcibly by the state gouges you and surveils everything you do in your
[40:02.600 --> 40:09.120]  home on record on record along with everything else and and and then Homeland
[40:09.120 --> 40:13.920]  Security is still having meetings and are still studying making you wear a
[40:13.920 --> 40:20.560]  shock bracelet when you fly everyone men women and children and I guarantee if
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.680]  they announce it peer pressure half the public will go come on the terrorists
[40:24.680 --> 40:29.960]  head us on 9-11 let's do this no more problem with hijacking
[40:32.040 --> 40:36.320]  look at how we're held hostage by the fear and the trauma-based mind control of
[40:36.320 --> 40:41.320]  9-11 when the very same criminal interests that stage 9-11 are running
[40:41.320 --> 40:45.440]  the al-qaeda operations today and it's not even our government it is the
[40:45.440 --> 40:49.880]  criminal networks it's a fact it's now in the BBC
[40:49.880 --> 40:57.360]  cyhurst just came out in the New Yorker yesterday weeks after we did well four or
[40:57.360 --> 41:00.640]  five months after we broke it all last year but more of it happened two weeks
[41:00.640 --> 41:07.760]  ago turkey staged terror attacks and was planning more terror attacks to be able
[41:07.760 --> 41:14.040]  to have a full military assault on Syria they're caught between al-qaeda forces
[41:14.040 --> 41:18.320]  coming out of Iraq and then other jihadis they're bringing in and training
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.720]  right on the border and the Russians are there in a proxy war and again people
[41:22.720 --> 41:25.360]  say well why are you siding with the Russians I'm not siding with the Russians
[41:25.360 --> 41:29.080]  I'm siding with we don't start wars against innocent countries that didn't
[41:29.080 --> 41:35.120]  do anything with a proxy of al-qaeda it'd be bad enough if they were trying to
[41:35.120 --> 41:38.320]  start a war and overthrow Assad to actually put in liberty they our
[41:38.320 --> 41:41.480]  government hasn't tried to put in freedom-oriented regimes since the late
[41:41.480 --> 41:48.720]  1950s our government puts in dictatorships folks our government wants to
[41:48.720 --> 41:52.400]  bring down countries just like the globalists want to bring us down
[41:52.400 --> 41:58.200]  cyhurst US intelligence feared Turkish Syrian supply you can go to info wars
[41:58.200 --> 42:04.320]  dot com it's a new article and it links through to the New Yorker magazine
[42:04.320 --> 42:10.440]  where the current wrote an article about it yesterday headline cyhurst Turkey
[42:10.440 --> 42:16.520]  Saudi Arabia staged nerve gas attack and then we're plotting for the new ones
[42:16.520 --> 42:19.760]  with the defense minister recorded by the Russians they're jacking the phone
[42:19.760 --> 42:26.160]  lines as well and putting out their NSA stuff saying yeah we can stage this we
[42:26.160 --> 42:29.720]  can stage that hey let's not talk about this on the phone the other the army
[42:29.720 --> 42:34.560]  general says we can stage stuff we're good at that folks part of war is
[42:34.560 --> 42:39.000]  staging stuff I hate to have to tell you that but generally what you do is you
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.280]  send in an expeditionary force to draw out the enemy force to get intel knowing
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.840]  the gambit of the pond is going to be wiped out
[42:48.840 --> 42:53.120]  Seymour Hirsch reveals Turks and Saudis work together with Al Nuzar at a
[42:53.120 --> 42:59.160]  stage attack so that's what's going on this is totally illegitimate and you
[42:59.160 --> 43:02.640]  know what I don't care of a TSA person's ignorant or a cop's ignorant at the
[43:02.640 --> 43:05.320]  airport and wants to come over and ask me where I'm going what I'm doing like
[43:05.320 --> 43:08.680]  I'm a terrorist you're setting up domestic internal checkpoints to
[43:08.680 --> 43:13.120]  overthrow our republic and it's your family and your birthright as well this
[43:13.120 --> 43:17.080]  police states being set up police because they're going to take everyone's
[43:17.080 --> 43:20.600]  pension funds and they're going to devalue the stock market and they're going
[43:20.600 --> 43:24.520]  to impoverish this country if they can get away with it if they study the tea
[43:24.520 --> 43:30.360]  leaves and all the data that they're aggregating in the data mining and know
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.640]  that they won't be able to pull this off they won't do it exposing their plans
[43:34.640 --> 43:39.080]  exposing their mega false flag nuke attack plans which you now see Obama
[43:39.080 --> 43:41.800]  hyping as I told you he would do that means they're actually thinking about
[43:41.800 --> 43:45.760]  doing it I've been telling you that for five six years they start hyping nuke
[43:45.760 --> 43:50.680]  attacks on New York and not saying who's going to be behind it look out because
[43:50.680 --> 43:54.640]  that means they're looking at playing that card I'll guarantee you they got
[43:54.640 --> 43:58.400]  nukes already in place right now in most major cities and it in the Russians
[43:58.400 --> 44:02.440]  that have done it they've got some as well that's come out actually in their
[44:02.440 --> 44:06.240]  embassies and other facilities the word is they've been dismantled though under
[44:06.240 --> 44:11.560]  under treaties secret treaty the point is is that all hell is going to break
[44:11.560 --> 44:15.280]  loose government's not digging into bunkers and trying to take on gun owners
[44:15.280 --> 44:19.480]  for no reason they want to break this country once and for all they want to
[44:19.480 --> 44:23.880]  bring us down the globalist they have a score to settle with America let's go
[44:23.880 --> 44:28.800]  back to the taser bracelets that homeland security is looking at for you
[44:28.800 --> 44:32.720]  and your family to fly by further equipping each bracelet with emd
[44:32.720 --> 44:37.360]  technology the bracelets will allow crew members using radio frequency
[44:37.360 --> 44:43.040]  transmitters to quickly and effectively subdue hijackers the electro muscular
[44:43.040 --> 44:46.840]  disruption signal overrides the attacker's central nervous system and
[44:46.840 --> 44:51.400]  will render even the most elite and aggressive terrorist completely immobile
[44:51.400 --> 44:54.560]  for several minutes terrorist is someone who doesn't want to go to the camp to
[44:54.560 --> 45:01.280]  subdue and handcuff that individual emd technology is designed a wimp culture
[45:01.280 --> 45:06.440]  they think we would accept this without causing problems which means these
[45:06.440 --> 45:12.360]  criminals will survive and go to trial oh the bracelet goes right armed by
[45:12.360 --> 45:18.800]  someone on board upon confirmation that a takeover situation exists to a
[45:18.800 --> 45:23.080]  businessman on his way home to be reunited with his family or to a young

[45:41.200 --> 45:44.800]  flight without the additional I wonder if he called it safety bracelets most
[45:44.800 --> 45:52.040]  passengers would happily opt for the extra security of the emd safety bracelet
[45:52.560 --> 45:57.120]  the last line of defense well there you go as we break down that incredible

[54:45.560 --> 54:51.280]  Joshua Dave Ted Joe gonna get to all of it folks want to talk about the taser
[54:51.280 --> 54:54.880]  brace looks like I'll go to some calls here just a minute
[54:54.880 --> 55:01.680]  jacari brought this over earlier in the new X-Men movie coming out they
[55:01.680 --> 55:06.720]  describe it online they wear inhibitor collars so their mutant powers can't
[55:06.720 --> 55:09.640]  come out and they're told to show up and register with the government and then
[55:09.640 --> 55:13.760]  they put the collars on them so you see this in all the Hollywood movies I haven't
[55:13.760 --> 55:18.920]  seen Captain America yet but I intend to I mean I hear it's all about false flags
[55:18.920 --> 55:22.800]  and government staging terror attacks as a pretext to take over society and
[55:22.800 --> 55:26.400]  again I see that as positive people say that's predictive programming in the
[55:26.400 --> 55:29.720]  movies maybe the higher level technocrats are letting these movies
[55:29.720 --> 55:34.800]  come out because they rationalize it and say it's predictive programming but I
[55:34.800 --> 55:38.240]  happen to know some of the producers or some of these big films they're putting
[55:38.240 --> 55:44.120]  this out because they're against what's going on in society but the
[55:44.120 --> 55:49.360]  technocrats can be right maybe it does just acclimate us I don't know it's a
[55:49.360 --> 55:56.000]  sophisticated question again we're gonna get into what in the world's
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.680]  happening with the NASDAQ and so much in the next hour and this new standoff
[56:01.680 --> 56:08.200]  going on out in the bottom stocks are tumbling right now we're gonna give you
[56:08.200 --> 56:12.840]  all those numbers I go to CMBC for me I want to see those current numbers on
[56:12.840 --> 56:18.720]  that but right now let's go to Chris in New York Chris are you an extremist you
[56:18.720 --> 56:22.440]  don't want to wear a shock bracelet when you fly to prove you're not a terrorist
[56:22.440 --> 56:28.320]  I mean aren't you aren't you slave until proven slave aren't you guilty until
[56:28.320 --> 56:34.080]  proven guilty I mean in America don't you wear taser bracelets I mean North
[56:34.080 --> 56:38.280]  Korea if they could afford them would do that too why not
[56:38.280 --> 56:44.840]  well Alex I just want to say that I do believe it does acclimate and there's
[56:44.840 --> 56:50.760]  predictive programming then again the producers might be trying to warn you
[56:50.760 --> 56:58.840]  if with the power grab that the police has abused in their powers people need
[56:58.840 --> 57:04.720]  to stay just the first minute of the movie The Running Man where they have
[57:04.720 --> 57:09.280]  that red screen with white letters I mean we're living that almost right now I
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.720]  know Jumbotron saying remember kids October is bonus recruitment month
[57:14.720 --> 57:18.640]  report a family member and receive a double bonus they actually teach in
[57:18.640 --> 57:22.800]  schools nationwide with little credit cards tattle on your family and get the
[57:22.800 --> 57:36.000]  highest bonus well another thing the EMD technology ad that you just ran speaks
[57:36.000 --> 57:43.120]  about bringing the suspect to trial with the Patriot Act and the NDA Act
[57:43.120 --> 57:50.640]  basically nobody goes to trial what trial are they talking about no I know and
[57:50.640 --> 57:54.080]  then it's like oh we are secretly spying on our political enemies and the
[57:54.080 --> 57:58.680]  Associated Press and Fox News and Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and everybody else
[57:58.680 --> 58:03.960]  and you know the TSA has dossiers on us because we dare criticize them these
[58:03.960 --> 58:08.360]  people are flaming authoritarian nobodies who couldn't run a business
[58:08.360 --> 58:11.920]  couldn't get a normal job they just create government jobs and make
[58:11.920 --> 58:17.120]  themselves God and then they work for the criminal banks and offshore
[58:17.120 --> 58:23.960]  corporations that launder the money and run the aircraft all of it the
[58:23.960 --> 58:29.280]  rendition everything it is a pack of crooks when we come back I'm gonna play
[58:29.280 --> 58:32.400]  a clip from the running man and actually read you just said the red red on
[58:32.400 --> 58:36.840]  white screen we're gonna come back in the next hour and cover that because it
[58:36.840 --> 58:42.000]  does describe what America's become stay with us thank you for always on
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.920]  Twitter real auctions it's important that I got to Twitter late folks our
[58:45.920 --> 58:50.080]  Twitter's not very big I want to get it up to a million
[58:50.080 --> 58:54.520]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[58:54.520 --> 58:57.960]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water

[59:01.880 --> 59:05.600]  water it's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents my

[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.200]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.960]  Chris the caller at the end of the last hour brought up the beginning of Running
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.800]  Man which is based on a short story by the great Stephen King and it became a
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:42.480]  movie I think in 1984 fittingly was it 85 and in it there's Jumbotron saying
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.960]  report on your neighbors they don't have those in Walmarts on the streets
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.320]  there's checkpoints on the highways they produce fake newscasts blaming
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.720]  patriots for terror attacks the government staging now how did how did
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:01:00.360]  King know how to write a short story about something that actually came true
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:06.320]  because that's what other authoritarian governments do it's like if you see a
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.600]  bird up in a tree you go watch that bird it's about to take off and fly then it
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:16.480]  flies and someone goes how did you know those can fly that's what they do that's
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.880]  where this goes it's not a oh I think it's gonna be all right they've got
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:24.120]  secret death camps and secretly arrest people and and and and you know have the

[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.880]  do you think Al Sharpton works for I've said that many times he's a government
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.960]  operative I would say above that Ford Foundation but I guess just FBI but that
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:27.720]  was back when he was a young political race pimp I'll guarantee you he is on
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.760]  Ford Foundation or Carnegie Foundation payroll getting directives he's way
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.560]  above FBI
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:44.240]  what a treasure this broadcast is that we are not part of the system and we

[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:55.440]  much family that worked in special operations black ops CIA you name it
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.960]  and that they told me how evil and bad it was thank God because obviously I was
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.960]  approached many times by establishment people and media heads and others to go
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:08.480]  into the system and I said go to go into a system it's gonna destroy everybody's
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:16.360]  future never never never never but I know how this whole system works ladies

[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.760]  to come out and say that was wrong because there are attacks on whites going
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:53.680]  on all over this country poor stupid self-hating guilt-ridden trendy wimpy
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.920]  pathetic limp-risted castrated white men all over this country they think that's

[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:28.080]  well Ted Cruz the senator hailing from Texas has told jeb bush the neocon fake
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:34.880]  conservative that an act of love legalizing all the illegals because
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.280]  they're just trying to join their families will basically destroy this
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.360]  country and we have to have a rule of law I mean what a no-brainer nobody says
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:50.360]  you can have 30 million illegals and then legalize them and then not have their
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.880]  next wave legalized and I got to be honest if the illegals were voting and
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:02.920]  we're hardcore libertarians and pro gun I could care less that they got tans that
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.280]  they're mainly from Mexico 80% of the immigrants this country from Mexico can
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.520]  care less man I tell you I was thinking about this just yesterday I would elect
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.000]  an entire Congress of nothing but Mexicans right now if I could hit the
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.240]  button you know in fantasy land and and elect 500 and something Ron Paul's that
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.920]  had last names like like like Laredo or Sanchez I would do it I could care less
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:36.520]  it's the brains it's it's it's the it's the ideology it'd be like Germany I
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.880]  mean I'd take 80 million Germans that's all there is in the world I'd take 80
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.280]  million Germans right now except the average German socialist so I don't
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:50.920]  think I want the socialist ones and what about in World War two would you want
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.120]  80 million because they were 80 million then they 20 million Germans died not
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:01.320]  little escapade how how how fascism work out for you there I sure wouldn't want
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:08.680]  them over here I mean it's a fact folks that 90 plus percent of Chinese
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:15.800]  immigrants vote Democrat socialist to take guns it's a fact 90 plus percent
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:25.880]  pure research of immigrants who become citizens who are Hispanic vote hardcore
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.880]  extreme Democratic Party line man it's game over folks the Democratic Party now

[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.800]  would laugh at you if you said we're getting rid of the word bossy because
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:56.040]  women don't like it they say wild extreme things to see what they can get away
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:01.080]  with all over the country at Mall of America you name it they have jumbo
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.600]  trons outside we've shown you video this saying report suspicious activity
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:10.320]  report anyone with guns report anyone with marijuana hundreds of Walmart's
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.240]  have telescreens with the head of Homeland Security saying report hi I'm
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:20.320]  general Poletano and you see your homeland security that is the image of
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.360]  1984 is outdoor telescreens and TVs that are two-way tracking what you do and
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.920]  what you watch they now have those for at least a decade all the digital cable
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.480]  boxes all the TVOs track what you do so a caller called in and I'm going right
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:43.320]  back to your calls on this subject Ted Joe Joshua Dane Michael we're gonna get
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.120]  to all of you but now holders come out and says they want gun owners to wear
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.480]  bracelets and Homeland Security is having proposals for to make everybody
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.440]  wear shock bracelets the caller said the first part the scrolling screen like
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:03.560]  Star Wars at the beginning of Running Man written by Stephen King how did he
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:07.680]  write this in the late 70s and it was made into a movie in the mid 80s how did
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.440]  it all come true because that's what other countries already did what we're
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:17.680]  doing is how it's like you know you make pancakes you get the flour you get the
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.600]  eggs you get the butter you mix it all together or it's buttermilk pancakes
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.760]  use buttermilk I mean it's like how do you know you're frying eggs you're
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:31.920]  cracking egg you fry it how do you know a tyranny the police wear black
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.880]  uniforms there surveillance everywhere there's a snitch society they're
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.400]  changing laws to take your bank accounts they're demonizing people that want
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:47.440]  checks and balances let's go to the intro screen that I'll read for radio
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:53.480]  listeners from the Running Man here it is and you guys back it up you can play
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:13:04.200]  it with the intro audio too now again folks at the beginning of the movie you
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:12.080]  see mad dog Ben Richards come in and stage a terror attack on the city but
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:16.320]  the truth is the government stage the terror attack and blamed him and who
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:23.800]  they set up a right-wing cop the Running Man by the year 2017 the world
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.040]  economy has collapsed or right online for that food natural resources and oil
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.080]  are in short supply a police state divided into paramilitary zones rules
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:37.560]  with an iron hand be my region 10 folks 10 regions I'm in six television is
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.520]  controlled by the state and a statistic game show called the Running Man has
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.040]  become the most popular program in history all art music and communications
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.160]  are controlled and censored no dissent is tolerated yet a small resistance
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.480]  movement has managed to survive underground when high-tech gladiators
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.160]  are not enough to suppress the people's yearning for freedom more direct
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:13.240]  methods become necessary fools riot in progress let's go to some more of this
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:17.880]  Schwarzenegger as the hero when in truth he's a total fascist and supports all
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:29.840]  this
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:43.440]  food riot in progress approximately 1500 civilians no weapons evidence
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:49.080]  eliminate anything moving I said the crowd is unarmed a lot of women and
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.640]  children down there all they want is food for God's sake as you were Richard
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:59.040]  proceed with plan alpha all riders must be eliminated the hell with you I would
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.040]  not buy on helpless people aboard mission to turn back the base the kind of
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.400]  standards do you copy affirmative take command detain Richard's and receive his
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:19.120]  order delay that all right that's enough the whole point is they've already
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.440]  psychologically tested most of police now where they will follow that order
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.200]  paramilitary police and by the way they have a real plan the Marine Corps has
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:32.640]  in place that was declassified in 99 reclassified in 2000 the Marines actually
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.840]  visited and demanded before it got reclassified the Sunshine Project of
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:43.680]  proto WikiLeaks at UT and threatened them to remove it but then we're too
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:51.280]  dumb or lazy to not get it off the Google archive it's still on there the
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:57.280]  plan with helicopters that are now drone in underground facilities some of them
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:02.880]  are in above ground that open up copters launch with nerve gas now the part they
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:07.720]  got declassified was the opiate gas they plan to kill entire cities and that's
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:14.040]  what the drones are for and I'm not I'm not joking around here with you okay it's
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.760]  time for you to grow up criminals have taken over they're not going to give it
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.840]  up lightly only realizing they've taken over will change it most people in
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.920]  government are not bad but they're compartmentalized all right I said I'd
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.360]  go to your phone calls and I want to kid in Tennessee thanks for calling you're
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.360]  on the air you want to talk about the gun bracelets holder wants you to wear or
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:35.360]  or is it the taser bracelets that they were in the running man around their
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:45.200]  neck hey Alex I have no real problem with having a bracelet you know what's the
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.360]  big deal it will make all guns made before that obsolete and they'll claim
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.840]  they have to be turned in because they're not safe it's a de facto ban of
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.440]  400 million firearms made in the last 70 years that are in the United States
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.400]  alone and the biometric bracelet can be deactivated by the establishment as all
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.120]  new cars have kill switches already in their ignition to be activated by
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:10.320]  police cruiser or helicopter as of 2005 so what's the big deal with the
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:15.280]  bracelets what what I believe is people should be judged by their
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.200]  intelligence not by how much money they have not by the political party you get
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:25.640]  rid of all the people with IQs under 150 life would be wonderful you know
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.840]  there are a lot of garbage IQ test out there and I love people that talk about
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.120]  how high their IQs are I know people that supposedly have 160 IQs that can't
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:41.080]  balance their checkbooks so a lot of it is I think the IQ test is is is skewed
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:45.320]  because it doesn't get into street smarts doesn't get into common sense it
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.920]  doesn't get into discernment it doesn't get into six cents doesn't get into a
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.360]  lot of that and and and you just called him with a total eugenics statement
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:57.920]  you're saying kill everybody with under 150 IQ we'd probably have like two
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:03.760]  million people left if we got everybody with under 150 IQ in the US but
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:10.880]  yeah so you want to kill you want to kill you want to kill if we only had two
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.080]  million people left in the United States how many people would be left how many
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.760]  people want to be killed for for for there to be two million people left in
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:25.360]  the country I figure 30,000 maybe okay CC you got such a high IQ you don't know
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.960]  there's 350 million people she'd have to kill 313 you'd have to kill you'd have
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:37.840]  to kill 313 million people pardon you want to kill you don't sound like you
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:45.080]  have a very high IQ I got a 190 I got a 500 if you've got a 190 you get that out
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:50.680]  of a cracker but did you get that out of a cracker box no seven colleges okay
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:56.280]  uh-huh seven government I got a hundred degrees I got a I got 500 no I'm a high
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.520]  energy nuclear engineer theory let me ask you this should we band our hydrogen

[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:23.200]  that last caller saying he had seven degrees and was in men's and all that
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.680]  stuff was probably a real caller and that's what they teach at the government
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:34.320]  funded universities on average is that your geniuses everyone else's scum
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:37.920]  you're the elite you have to run everybody's life and then they go get
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.760]  government jobs or academic jobs I mean if you killed all the stupid people
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:48.640]  where would the government be and at the bottom of the liberal ideology is an
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.560]  exterminist ultra hitlerian control freak cult and when we come back in the
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:59.240]  next segment can we play the silent green piece you know that ties it in with
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:03.440]  Pepsi with its flavor testing being from dead babies and the fact that many of the
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.520]  top cosmetics fenced out of China into France and England are made it out of
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.840]  babies and there's a huge burgeoning global trade in baby flesh I mean that's
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.200]  all in the news and I did that video and it got over a hundred thousand views
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:20.360]  should have gotten 10 million views and people are in the comments going where's
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:25.040]  the proof I don't believe people are eating babies I mean it's like where's
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.960]  the proof China sells organs it's just completely admitted in a thousand
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:34.440]  publications China publicly advertises they sell the organs of political
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:40.560]  dissidents the State Department ten years ago criticized it then like five
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:47.720]  years ago they changed it and said that's a myth just total lies yes China
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.760]  still harvest organs from executed prisoners the Washington Post there's
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:56.600]  the mobile execution van I talk about that and people laugh at me I talk about
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.560]  geoengineering they laugh every time I talk about how the US government dead
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.520]  ended over a hundred hydrogen bombs and the atmosphere trying to blow out the
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:08.640]  atmosphere destroy the van Allen radiation belt or ignite the atmosphere or
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:15.400]  cause an EMP people go that's crazy Trinity is hosted by William Shatner's
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:21.800]  got the high-deaf footage of it you people just because you're ignorant of
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.920]  something doesn't mean let me tell you the elite the guys building those
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:31.720]  nuclear weapons have got hundred to sixty hundred seventy IQs for real but
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:37.400]  they're so crazy there's something about really high IQs that they found they're
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.120]  really stupid if it's a scientific type they're almost like autistic like I know
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.480]  some real geniuses I know one who's got over a hundred and seventy IQ certified
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:50.360]  and who literally came up with all sorts of
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.200]  mathematic equations for computers and help design fighter jets and everything
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.640]  else and I'm not going to get into it and they're so smart they can hardly talk
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:05.000]  to you of course I don't think that guy bumbling around was you know all he
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.920]  says is it's a whole cult of people with their with their mail order you know
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:14.040]  diploma saying how smart they are but when you get into that whole culture the
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.520]  whole academic culture it is just hate everyone else oh you're so elite and I'm
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:22.640]  I'm over generalizing but that's the mindset of people that would get on the
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.960]  news and say your kids belong to the state we know better than you well look
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.240]  at how you've been running society it's going to hell in a handbasket because
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:36.120]  you're swindling everything let's go to Joe in California then we'll go to
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:40.240]  Dane and others go ahead you're on the air Joe
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:49.320]  hello Alex hey oh yeah yeah well I'm not going to make any claims about being a
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:56.640]  genius but I do have a couple ideas first of all I mean if they have those
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.640]  bracelets they want everybody to wear and if somebody's retarded enough to put
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:06.240]  one of those things on are they all on the freight same frequency so if there
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.520]  is an issue the guy comes out and hits the button would obviously be massive
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:14.880]  malfunctions and they're out but the issue is land of the free home of the
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:21.160]  brave wearing a taser bracelet I mean this is pathetic and then the government
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:26.040]  is running the terrorists and they've been caught where's my apology from all
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:35.680]  the neocon talk show host well my other thought was if they want to start you
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.680]  putting bracelets on people what they should do is make everybody who is in
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.520]  government wear one of those bracelets and when their approval rating drops
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:50.760]  below 95% they get stunned yeah that's an intriguing idea well that is an
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:55.640]  American pastime that that when their approval rating drops below say 50% they
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.160]  get dropped into a vat of boiling a tar
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:06.560]  well anyway it was just an idea so well before they put fluoride in the water and
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:10.760]  gave us GMO that makes the rats fat and dumb and die you know people couldn't
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:15.000]  help it you pushed folks around they would rebel but now they've given us
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.680]  you're better living through chemicals like the movie Serenity where you know
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.280]  they I don't want to give away the whole movie but at the end they find out the
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:27.080]  government's been put in Prozac in the atmosphere and it's caused everybody
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:31.920]  99% of people to basically just collapse and die because they just quit living but
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:38.000]  then 1% turn into total psychopathic murdering killers and I mean that's
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.080]  basically what's happened there's even some studies out there where they admit
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.120]  that all this chemical stuff is actually giving rise to resistant humans but
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.520]  what do you think was gonna happen we'll be right back stay with us we're on the

[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:34.840]  sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity. The powdered flesh from
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:39.880]  dead babies some people believe they can cure disease. Because of its enormous
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:45.720]  popularity, Soil and Green is in short supply. Remember Tuesday is Soil and
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:51.360]  Green Day. The supply of Soil and Green has been exhausted. You must evacuate the
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:34:00.600]  area. The shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company are not
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:05.760]  allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring but we
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.560]  already know so enjoy the flavor. We're gonna get the real solution which is
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.320]  gonna be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes. I'm consistently
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:18.080]  pro-death I'm for assisted suicide I'm for regular
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.440]  zoos and I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving. Is spending a million
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.560]  dollars on that last three months of life for that patient would it be better
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:31.640]  not to lay off the those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off and medical
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:35.440]  cost but that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:41.480]  discussion. They told me to to say that they were sorry but that you had become
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:53.880]  unreliable. Is this the kind of society that you want to live in? Any kind of
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:57.280]  society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:02.120]  citizens. It will do it to its dissidents. That kind of society will also
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.600]  eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:11.640]  puzzlings and the collaborators who make that possible. This is nothing but a
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.600]  suicide cult.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:20.600]  The scoops are on their way. The scoops are on their way. I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:27.600]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life. You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.600]  We've got to stop them. Come on.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:39.600]  Soylent Green is people.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:47.600]  Next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food. You've got to tell them.
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:53.600]  Give not your children to the fires of Molek. We can pull up Leviticus on screen for
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.600]  folks. Leviticus 1821. Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molek
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:04.600]  for you must not profane the name of the Lord your God. That is the new
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:08.600]  international version, a new living translation. Do not permit any of your children to be
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:13.600]  offered as a sacrifice to Molek or you'll bring shame on the name of your God.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:19.600]  Where's the King James? There it is. And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:24.600]  the fire to Molek. Neither shalt thou profane the name of God.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:31.600]  That's pretty wild that using the Lord's name in vain is like next to sacrificing
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:36.600]  your children. But I guess it's about as common with 52 million, 54 million whatever is
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:40.600]  abortions in this country. Never take a million or two. It's like one man dies.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:46.600]  It's a tragedy, 10,000 died statistic. We're going to cover that with a special report
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:56.600]  on do flags at half mask, do flags at half masked insult the troops? I think it does.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  Now I'm going to explain why in just a moment. I mean, when Whitney Houston died,
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:08.600]  they had the flags at half mask nationally. It's incredible. We're going to be
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.600]  talking about that coming up because it just shows it's not about the flag being
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:18.600]  half masked. It's about how sentimentality becomes the replacement for actual real
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:24.600]  freedom or taking care of the troops. I'm going to explain that in a moment.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:28.600]  Dane in California, thanks for holding. Thanks for calling.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.600]  Alex, how are you doing? I'm doing all right, brother.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.600]  Well, I just want to switch it up real quick and say that I'm a trendy and I love
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.600]  the idea of the bracelets. As long as they're yellow, purple, red, you know what,
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.600]  any color of a rainbow, I'm good with it. You know why? Because I'm trendy.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:52.600]  I love Obama and he's my savior. And you like, you like Obamacare prices going up
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:57.600]  and you like death panels. I love Obamacare, Alex. It's the greatest thing
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.600]  everybody has healthcare for free and I get to keep my doctor.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:07.600]  And Obama never lies about anything because he is funny and he's just wonderful.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:12.600]  Well, I'm glad you're not racist and love him.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:18.600]  I'm sorry. I can't handle this guy anymore.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:24.600]  Is anybody not watching their television set and understanding this guy is a liar?
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.600]  He lies. He lies. He lies. He lies.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.600]  Racist, racist, racist.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.600]  Racist.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:35.600]  Yeah, you're right. Alex, I'm not a racist. I'm a trendy, okay?
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:42.600]  And I love my taser bracelet because it makes me feel safe and it's wonderful.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:46.600]  I think all men should have to wear the taser bracelet and submit to their wives,
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.600]  but only men to prove they're not sexes and then the wives sit there and zap it,
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:54.600]  but you won't wear the taser bracelet on your wrist.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.600]  Me and everybody else.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:59.600]  You'll wear it on your ankle. I'm sorry.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:07.600]  My ankle, both my bracelets around my neck, it'll make me feel good.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.600]  I don't know.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:13.600]  Well, that's what you do to prove you're not racist.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:14.600]  I love you, brother.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:18.600]  You know, I've been listening to you for years now and I'm a first-time caller
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:21.600]  and I just had to call and, you know, you got to have a little humor with this stuff
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.600]  and it's just out of bounds.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.600]  I mean, it's just constant. It never stops.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:33.600]  The lies never end. It's a never-ending pit of lies and deceit and devil-worshipping
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.600]  and you name it, pedophilia. These guys are criminal.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.600]  Well, that's what it is. Evil is seizing all of the major institutions.
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:45.600]  It happens in history. It's repeating and telling us good is bad.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.600]  Freedom is bad. The family is bad. Men are bad. Women are bad.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.600]  George Washington is bad. I mean, these are obvious.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:56.600]  Look at Al Sharpton. There's a photo of him on Drudge.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.600]  Detail, Sharpton was FBI mob snitch.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:04.600]  Well, I mean, look at him. Who would associate with a degenerate, disgusting person
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:09.600]  with that much horrible taste? I mean, look at that hair, folks.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:17.600]  He looks like just the epitome of a joke, of a fraud, of a scamster,
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:23.600]  of a stinking pile of crap, of a race-baiting FBI,
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:30.600]  COINTELPRO disinformation officer, just like Jesse Jackson,
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:36.600]  who on record brought out Martin Luther King to be shot and helped cover it up.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:40.600]  I mean, that's who these guys are. The only reason they haven't been killed
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.600]  is because they're playing ball with the system.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:51.600]  It's absolutely disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.600]  Really weird statements out of him, though.
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.600]  I'm a cat, not a rat, but I was fat.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:03.600]  Benny eggs, chin, fritzy, corky, and baldy dom.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:10.600]  That's almost as important as topless woman ransacks McDonald's, steals ice cream.
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:14.600]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:19.600]  Here's some of the stories up on infowars.com,
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:24.600]  and there are scores of them on the site.
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.600]  Man, I tell you, there are new bankers, suicides, and deaths, and murders every day.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.600]  CEO of Lichtenstein Bank. Oh, that's one of the big places that people park money.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:36.600]  Murdered in broad daylight. I mean, it's getting bad.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.600]  Cops snatches man's cell phone as he videos traffic stop.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  Says it could be a firearm. I'm going to play that later.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:46.600]  We have a riot in the Ukrainian parliament as they beat each other up.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.600]  I want to get to that.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.600]  Marriott, again, confirmed special event where Bilderberg's being held this year in Europe.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.600]  I'm going to send Watson bare minimum I might go.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.600]  Russia says U.S. mercenaries in eastern Ukraine. That's big.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.600]  I've got to cover this.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:05.600]  Red Dawn supporters rally to defend family-facing showdown with the feds.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:08.600]  Blags that have mass insults troops. I want to play that video in a moment.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:16.600]  And Eric Holder wants gun owners to wear smart gun bracelets.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:21.600]  You know what? I don't think I'm casting. I would cast him as...
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:29.600]  I would cast Al Sharpton as like a vampire that sucks children's hope out and destroys their future.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:32.600]  And then creates racial division.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:39.600]  I mean, now he looks like he's emaciated or something.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.600]  I shouldn't even be talking about Al Sharpton.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:49.600]  I mean, there's just no end to this guy reading off teleprompters.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:53.600]  There's a lawsuit out nursing home routinely hired strippers for elderly residents.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.600]  You know, see, they love that kind of quote corruption.
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.600]  They'll probably put all the people in jail or something.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:02.600]  Meanwhile, you know, if you're flying little kids out of Saudi Arabia,
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.600]  kidnapped out of their backyards, you get a medal.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:08.600]  Russia issues warning as Ukraine cracks down on protesters.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:12.600]  NATO warns against historic mistake that what's happening is they know.
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:17.600]  And I predicted that what will probably happen is Russia won't have taken more than just Crimea
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.600]  because the people are going to demand it and you're going to have a break now
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:27.600]  and ethnic cleansing on both sides will turn into a new Bosnia-Herzegovina.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.600]  And that's where all this is going.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:31.600]  And then they'll call it Russian aggression.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:36.600]  When the West started the fight over to the government and inflamed the sectarian divisions
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:47.600]  with at least five billion greenbacks, five million greenbacks, five billion greenbacks.
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.600]  Hard to even get my mind around that number in the last four or five years
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.600]  to stir all this up over there.
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.600]  That's on record.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:04.600]  I'm going to go to Michael and Dustin and Mike and Sean and others here in a moment.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:06.600]  But here is the report I mentioned.
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:11.600]  Then we've got Leon McAdiz report coming up as well on how big corporations are exempt from Obamacare,
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:17.600]  but you aren't, man on the street, very informative and very politically incorrect.
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:25.600]  So let's go ahead and go to my report. Alex Jones, flags at half mass are insult to troops.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:28.600]  We need to probably add on the YouTube are insult troops.
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:33.600]  Flags at half mass insult, because the headline on Info Wars was flags at half mass insult troops,
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:41.600]  which I guess you can use, but I think we should say flags at half mass insults are or are an insult to troops.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:46.600]  But here is that report from the Info Wars Nightly News last night.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:54.600]  In the wake of the tragic shooting at Fort Hood, Texas last week, Governor Rick Perry did what I expected him to do.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:45:04.600]  He came out and ordered the flags in the state of Texas flown at half massed, which on the surface seems like a nice thing to do.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:10.600]  But it was Joseph Stalin, one of history's greatest tyrants that said when one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:13.600]  When 10,000 die, it's a statistic.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:18.600]  22 veterans commit suicide every day, seven of them active duty.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:23.600]  That's a world record, even breaking the record that we saw at the end of Vietnam.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:29.600]  There's no discussion of that. They just throw more psychotropic drugs at them known to cause suicide.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:33.600]  They make them serve more and more deployments. They treat them like crap.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:37.600]  A lot of them are going bankrupt. They cut their pay. They screw them over.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:43.600]  But it's okay because Rick Perry put the flags at half mass, and then we all feel sorry for the dead.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:47.600]  The three dead, four of you count the shooter. 16 wounded.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:54.600]  When we've got 22 people killing themselves, seven, every single day, who are active duty.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:59.600]  Think about that. The flag makes us feel good, like we're doing something for the veterans.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:06.600]  It's sentimental. It's totally on the surface. Just like Obamacare. They say it's free. They say you can keep your doctor.
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:11.600]  You like your plan and your doctor. You can keep them. You'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.600]  If you like your plan, you keep your plan.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:18.600]  If you like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.600]  They say it's wonderful. All of its lies raises payroll taxes on poor people, gets rid of your doctor,
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:28.600]  doubles or triples prices, written by the big insurance companies, lets them lower the standard of care.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:36.600]  Doesn't matter. Obama loves you and wanted to give you something like Perry gave us a flag at half mass.
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:42.600]  And I'm not just attacking Rick Perry. He would be attacked if he didn't put the flag at half mass.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:48.600]  What does that say about us? We want to feel good about ourselves while not actually getting our hands dirty
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.600]  and finding out why the so-called volunteer army is killing itself.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:47:01.600]  The truth is, too many deployments, drugs known to cause suicide, sweeping it under the rug, veterans being treated like crap.
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:06.600]  All these Homeland Security reports saying veterans are the number one terror threat in the future,
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:10.600]  that the Tea Party is a threat, that evangelicals are a threat.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.600]  Simply put, the veterans are being treated like garbage and that's why they're committing suicide.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:22.600]  And so we need to stop treating them like garbage, not just pat them on the head or give the dog a bone by flying the flag at half mass.
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:33.600]  It really is absurd and it really illustrates how we've become a nation of Bessers, run by a culture of PR pitchmen.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:38.600]  In fact, they're getting rid of the White House press corps now. They're not even going to have regular press conferences.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:46.600]  And why should they? They can just have PR flags, put out the lies, and then the accomplice media, the lapdog press, will go along with it.
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:57.600]  So that's why every time I saw the flags this last weekend at half-mashed, it irritated me, because it reminded me of how not just the veterans,
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:04.600]  but foster children, anybody who's in government care or in government clutches, is treated like absolute garbage.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:14.600]  And how, as the government and Obamacare and the school lunch program federalize everything, more and more, I am a slave of this system, just as you are.
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:20.600]  And I want off this plantation. I don't want to see our veterans treated like crap.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.600]  I don't want to see the politicians exempt from all the things they do to us.
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:29.600]  I want to see them out there fighting for this empire if they think it's so great.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:34.600]  But we know the rich kids of Congress almost never go to war.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:43.600]  Alex Jones, signing off for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com. Now back to InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:52.600]  And again, folks, I will be hosting the Nightly News at least three or four nights a week, most of it, and you'll have special reports and guests.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:58.600]  And we're ready to move into the studio and turn it all on. I've just had a hundred other things going on, but that's getting very, very close.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:02.600]  We couldn't have built all of this without you being PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:05.600]  So we're going to take the InfoWars to the next level. We're doing it right now.
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:12.600]  It's 15 cents a day or $5.95 a month, or you can get a year membership and get three months free, and you get 11 memberships.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:22.600]  For the price of one, every membership can be used simultaneously by 11 people.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:27.600]  You can share username and passcode with friends and family. So share that, take advantage of that.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.600]  The site just gets better and better. All my films, so much more.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:34.600]  Become a PrisonPlanet.tv member today.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:38.600]  And we're moving away from PrisonPlanet.tv and the branding of it.
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:42.600]  I came up with that name years ago along with InfoWars. So I wanted to fight the PrisonPlanet.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:47.600]  It's going to be more and more just InfoWars news, but the URL will still be PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:51.600]  But we're going to have the URLs with InfoWars news and at InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:59.600]  As the main focus is, we've already got cable and TV, already downloading it every day and putting it on cable and TV systems.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.600]  We're just getting ready to put it up on satellite and deliver it to a bunch of other places.
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:06.600]  I've had a lot of unforeseen and expected things going on that have really taken up a lot of my time.
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.600]  We're moving forward on that. So thank you all for your support.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:13.600]  You can see it every night, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.600]  Then those of you that are members, pay it forward.
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:22.600]  Large portions of it are then put on YouTube and other platforms for free to wake up the general unwashed, uninformed masses.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:26.600]  So it's essential to fund the tip of the spear by your war bonds today.
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:27.600]  It's an incredible value.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:30.600]  I want to thank all of you that are members, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:36.600]  And don't forget, lastly, this hour was brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:39.600]  It's organic, great customer service, great preparedness.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:42.600]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:51:11.600]  They're phone numbers on the side as well.

[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:20.600]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:27.600]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:51.600]  Al Sharpton, Agent C-17 for the FBI, his mission to sow racial discord and divides in New York City.
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:54:20.600]  Mission accomplished. You're a faithful servant of evil, Al Sharpton. You've been rewarded with a TV show on a collapsing television network.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:34.600]  We're going to go back to your phone calls and then I've got the Leanne McAdoo report coming up in the next segment with her going out and pointing out that big businesses are exempt from Obamacare,
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:40.600]  but mom and pops aren't the ultimate form of discrimination. That's coming up. The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:43.600]  Right now, Michael in Texas, thanks for calling. You're on the air.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:45.600]  How are you, Alex?
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:46.600]  Good, brother.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:59.600]  My first time calling here. One thing I want to say is a guy with an IQ on the Eastmount calming down on that guy. That guy was a joke.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:17.600]  Another thing here in East Texas, I tell these people, I've been listening to you for about a year and I'm trying to spread the word what's going on. It's stuff I told them about and they don't have a clue.
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:25.600]  When I saw the FEMA camp, that's the one thing that got my blood going.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:34.600]  Of course, they're secretly spying on us without warrants. They're secretly narcotics trafficking. They're engaging in criminal activity and saying it's national security.
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:38.600]  Well, it's not national security. It's national criminality run by offshore interest.
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:47.600]  And under the Emergency Centers Establishment Act and under the civilian and mate labor camp program in Rex 84, anybody can look this up, declassified.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:56:02.600]  They have a secret archipelago of camps for us and our family. And these people mean business and they're training Homeland Security as a national secret police force to stage terror attacks and blaming on us and come after us.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:06.600]  They want to do this, folks. People have to admit it. Go ahead.
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:18.600]  I tell them, you know, I mean, I have a lot of guns myself. I mean, whatever. But anyway, you know, a year ago when all the ammo went up, everybody's freaking out. Oh, it's just to boost their autonomy.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:24.600]  It's just blah, blah, blah. They don't believe they bought 70 million rounds or whatever it was.
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:27.600]  That was one part. It's like 2.6 billion last time I checked.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:39.600]  Even mainline publications are saying why is there a federal arms race? All these agencies that were never armed or arming, they're spending hundreds of millions per Social Security Administration on blackwater type mercenaries.
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:45.600]  I don't people believe that. I mean, did they just watch CNN? Is that the problem?
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:53.600]  Well, the government can't believe the crimes it's gotten away with with a special interest. So they're digging in. I mean, they've already stolen trillions.
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:57.600]  I mean, I mean, they've taken over and they're now going to steal everything.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:05.600]  And they've got a bunch of people that think they're do gooders, you know, federal agents and people that are going to start the Civil War.
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:11.600]  And when the feds blow stuff up and blame it on us, the average feds not going to know their bosses did it.
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:20.600]  But because of fast and furious in Oklahoma City and Benghazi, people now know about false flags. So it's not going to be a cakewalk this time.
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:31.600]  I mean, in fact, it's just Obamacare. I mean, my girl graduated a master. She's a self-employed. She tried to get Obamacare.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:41.600]  She can afford normal insurance and she wouldn't give it to. But they'll go give it to someone sitting at home with five kids that doesn't work.
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.600]  Well, that's the goal. And because those people can vote and then it's game over.
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:56.600]  Now, once they put the authoritarianism in, all these people sitting on their butts are going to be on TV in the work camps with people going, oh, look at those slobs.
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:59.600]  You know, they'll have Friday night movies and rock bands will come play for them.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:03.600]  They advertise the camps in Germany and Russia as wonderful places.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:10.600]  And in the Emergency Centers Establishment Act, it talks about community groups and music and, you know, arts and crafts.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:16.600]  And just if you cause a problem, you're going to be taken to a special area.
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:20.600]  And of course, you're going to have to be reeducated, mainly men.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:26.600]  Because we need to be here for the ego trip of socialists to beat us up before they rape our lives.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:36.600]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:40.600]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:13.600]  This is not a low grade formula.

[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:03.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:08.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:12.600]  U.S. stocks rise up to three day loss.
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:17.600]  Earnings ahead.
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:19.600]  They've got all these reports on MSNBC.
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:22.600]  CNBC saying the stock market's not a hoax.
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:26.600]  Everything's fine.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:33.600]  One big reason you see the stock market still going up is all that QE money and all that inflationary money is following it.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:35.600]  I want to show TV viewers a photo.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:38.600]  Radio listeners can just go to New York Daily News and see it.
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:44.600]  Former presidents, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, spotted together at NCAA championship game.
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:50.600]  Because they now call Clinton Bubba and brother and he's a member of the family.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:55.600]  And I need to do a whole special report on this just to re-document it because it's all there.
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:04.600]  That when Bush was president, Herbert Walker, he met secretly 11 times with Bill Clinton a year into his term,
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:07.600]  a year and a half before Clinton was even really running.
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:14.600]  I mean, Mina Arkansas, the Bush's total gangsters, it is a sick joke.
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:21.600]  Clinton was the really fourth term of George Herbert Walker Bush,
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:25.600]  because Reagan got shot pretty quick, got given cold blood,
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:30.600]  they would sleeping pill him up and then hide him back up to go out and give a speech.
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.600]  So, I mean, most of Reagan's terms were George Herbert Walker Bush,
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:41.600]  Mr. CFR, Trilateral Commission, Federal Reserve, CIA, all of it.
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:44.600]  And then Clinton, they did that whole stage deal with Clinton.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:50.600]  They put Clinton in and now they've got that scam charity together where they spend the money on their private jets.
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.600]  I mean, it's just a total joke.
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:58.600]  It's just like Boehner, you know, won't repeal Obamacare, he'll just mess with it and act like he did something to confuse the public.
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:03.600]  That's why we're in trouble. Boehner plays golf with Obama and they hang out and scam everybody.
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:09.600]  And Clinton is CIA and that even came out of him in Hillary when they were in England.
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:12.600]  Even in the name of their section chief.
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:19.600]  And it's just a total joke. These are people that use the CIA to set up their own personal covert coup.
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:23.600]  But they're smarter than, like, you know, folks in third world countries, they don't just stay in power.
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:27.600]  They rotate in amongst the little inner group.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:33.600]  And so Obama got brought forward by the Clintons and now Hillary's back and it's like North Korea.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:38.600]  You know, you got the grandpa, you got Kim Jong-il, you got Kim Jong-un.
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:45.600]  And I guess they all like, you know, I guess they all like sports together.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:47.600]  Why not have Dennis Rodman there with them?
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:54.600]  It's just to say Clinton and Bush sat next to each other in the luxury box to the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones at AT&T Stadium Monday,
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:03:00.600]  laughing at their images were shown in the giant stadium view boards.
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:02.600]  I mean, what a joke.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:08.600]  Former President Bill Clinton initially took a back seat to his successor during the National Anthem at the NCAA game,
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:12.600]  but on the, it just goes on from there.
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:18.600]  But once the game began, Clinton and former President Bush gathered in the same row and sat next to each other in a luxury box
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:22.600]  along the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who gets the stadiums paid for by taxpayers.
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.600]  Man, all these rich people, these billionaires, get their money off us.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:31.600]  And then they're the ones always lobbying for higher taxes.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:35.600]  Warren Buffett, Jerry Jones, all of you, I hate you.
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:36.600]  You make me want to vomit.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:43.600]  I can't believe Jerry Jones has the same name my grandfather had.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:45.600]  It is just so obnoxious.
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:52.600]  They all just want to preen and sit and, you know, watch a game and have everyone get into it.
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:55.600]  And, oh my gosh, they're such big stars.
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:02.600]  A bunch of thieving, taxpayer-sucking elites.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:05.600]  Jerry Jones net worth $2.7 billion.
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:09.600]  Yeah, it wouldn't be that if he paid for his billion and a half dollar stadium.
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:12.600]  Or the stadium before that that was $800 million.
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:17.600]  But no, the suckers all paid for it and guaranteed his investment.
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:23.600]  So he can sit up there with those two criminals, George W. Bush and Clinton.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:27.600]  William Jefferson Clinton.
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:31.600]  And literally suck off of us because they're all tax exempt.
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:33.600]  You know when the taxes are going to get cut?
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:36.600]  When the elites stop being tax exempt.
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:37.600]  That's the real discrimination.
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.600]  Warren Buffett, all of them.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:42.600]  Cynthia McKinney's coming up to cover the waterfront with us.
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:44.600]  Your phone calls as well.
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:54.600]  Stay with us.

[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:55.600]  while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:06:00.600]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:04.600]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:09.600]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:16.600]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:23.600]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:25.600]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:30.600]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:34.600]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:38.600]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:51.600]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:55.600]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:59.600]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:02.600]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:07.600]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:09.600]  from cold toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:13.600]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:17.600]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:23.600]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:27.600]  Fluoride is in teats and coffees and water and breads and toothpaste.
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:31.600]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:34.600]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:22.600]  We are joined by former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, who's one of the most demonized people out there,
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:27.600]  because she upsets the entire political structure.
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:38.600]  And she joins us now to discuss the Ukraine, Syria, what's happening all over the world, what's happening with Obamacare.
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:46.600]  You know, as she has said many times, paraphrasing others, Obama isn't the lesser of two evils.
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:54.600]  He's the more effective of evils. Do you imagine if Bush would have gotten a third term and would have tried this type of stuff?
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:09:00.600]  The country to quote KRS-1 on this broadcast was on the verge of revolution.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:06.600]  Put Bush in a third term, he would have had a revolution.
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:10.600]  You put Obama in, everybody goes back to sleep.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:15.600]  And then he can launch wars, invade Africa with Africa, which I said in the Obama deception six years ago.
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:20.600]  We knew who his advisors were. We knew who was financing him.
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:24.600]  People say, well, then, should we have voted for John McCain? No.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:28.600]  It's like a Don King match. It's like, who do I bet on in this heavyweight championship?
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:34.600]  He owns both the fighters. You can bet your bottom dollar. It's rigged.
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:43.600]  He was rigging bookmaking 50 years ago and beating people to death.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:48.600]  So the answer is you don't bet on either pony.
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:58.600]  And it comes down to that. It comes down to getting past the political labels, getting past the football issues,
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:06.600]  that they passed back and forth, and getting down to the fact that we've been conquered by offshore mega banks that are engaging in divide and conquer and co-intel pro.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:13.600]  And Cass Sunstein's cognitive infiltration to make a sin fight with each other, black, white, old, young, north, south, east, west,
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:21.600]  while the power structure sets up a paramilitary force to go after their domestic enemies.
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:29.600]  And that's what's happening here is the ruling class wants to continue their predatory activity. And I wanted to get Cynthia McKinney's take on all these issues.
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:40.600]  But first off, I wanted to get her take on the armored vehicles, the 2.6 billion rounds of ammunition, homeland security training to take on gun owners
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:45.600]  and libertarians and constitutionalists and people, you know, anti-war folks.
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:54.600]  The whole list is anybody who's politically aware, has a conscience, whatever name you call yourself, if you're involved, if you don't want the NSA spying on you.
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:11:01.600]  They're now saying homeland security's for us. This is a classical tyrannical takeover in slow motion, but it's accelerating.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:11.600]  And the only way they could get it done is with Obama. And so that's why I point out that Obama has been so destructive because they can have people,
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:20.600]  like what was it, Agent C-17, Al Sharpton, who I know Cynthia McKinney knows, I want to get her take on this.
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:26.600]  We can have people like this gentleman who it's now coming out supposedly, you know, this FBI informant and all the rest of it.
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:36.600]  Well, look at what we heard about Jesse Jackson or any of, not just quote black leaders, other people, this whole government system of infiltrating out there.
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:42.600]  Cynthia, I've thrown out a shotgun effect of information run, Cynthia run.org.
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:47.600]  Folks don't want you to run for Congress again. And we'll talk about that later as well. Will you do it?
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:51.600]  But I just threw all that out there. What do you want to tackle first?
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:12:11.600]  Well, the system of informants, let's let's deal with that one first, because we don't know the Department of Homeland Security and you have reported this has recruited people from neighborhoods,
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:28.600]  not just from organizations and from corporations, but from neighborhoods, average ordinary folk to serve as informants to let, you know, this whole thing, if you see something, say something.
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:46.600]  Well, it comes from someplace. And what it comes from is having a whole new set of eyes. That's your friends eyes, your cohort in your organizations, your social and community organizations in your churches.
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:13:04.600]  You don't know who is who anymore, because one of the ways that the FBI used in COINTELPRO, the counterintelligence program to disrupt organizations was through the cultivation of informants.
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:16.600]  And eventually, as one friend of mine said in the Black Panther Party, there was there were more informants than there were members.
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:28.600]  And this is this is the embodiment of everything that we heard was happening in communist countries that the United States was supposedly against.
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:43.600]  So this whole informant cultivation, the I was against it was a voice vote that was taken for the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and I, you know, I was by myself again.
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:55.600]  But I did my voice vote against the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security that was in the International Relations Committee.
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:13.600]  The bottom line is that we don't need a Department of Homeland Security and I, you know, if I were back in Congress, maybe that's one of the first bills I introduced is to dismantle what has been constructed because the only purpose of Homeland Security.
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:19.600]  It's not that they have tried to tell us that our fellow Americans are enemies.
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:26.600]  So they're securing home from home. That's the first thing.
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:43.600]  Second thing with respect to President Obama. Well, you mentioned Obamacare, which, you know, I just think is I had a friend over here on March 30.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:55.600]  No, March 31. And so it was the last day, which of course they extended, but it was the last day.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:08.600]  And we don't know there hasn't been enough talk, in my opinion, on the IRS hammer that's going to come down on people who, for whatever reason, don't sign up.
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:16.600]  But first of all, when you go through the process, you have to give the government so much of your information.
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:26.600]  Now, you know, there was a time when I would have supported that and under different circumstances, I might support.
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:35.600]  But under the current circumstances, where I'm not really even going to get health care, what I'm going to get is health insurance.
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:46.600]  The other thing is that people are saying, oh, well, you know, my health insurance cost me zero. That is not correct.
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:57.600]  Because the subsidy is a government payment from the government of direct pipeline to the insurance companies.
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:07.600]  Now, the insurance companies are part of the problem. They stepped in between the patient and the health care.
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:13.600]  That's right. They want to control the quality of care, cut it back, jack up the price. They're the ones that wrote it.
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:21.600]  That's why the Republican leadership won't kill it. It's a big scam, just like Clinton and Bush together being best buddies.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:26.600]  That whole thing was staged. That's come out there all in the CIA. It's all a big scam.
[02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:32.600]  The insurance companies wrote it to rip everybody off. It's not even socialist health care. It's fascist health care.
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:44.600]  No, you're absolutely right. And my position is Medicare for all. Okay. Now, if I were going to get health care, that's one thing.
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:49.600]  Oh, I gotta say, that would have been so easy. You don't qualify. You're poor. You get Medicare.
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:17:01.600]  No, no, no, no, no. We got to give corporate welfare to the insurance companies that is just on its face 500 times worse than a limited solution of taking care of poor people.
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:06.600]  It absolutely is 500 times worse. You couldn't have said it better.
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:20.600]  And then this matter, getting back to Homeland Security and the cultivation of the informants, it appears that what's happening is through this Department of Homeland Security,
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:38.600]  we're reinstating COINTELPRO, the Counterintelligence Program, which when it became public, the excesses of the FBI and the activities of the CIA inside the United States were illegal.
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:50.600]  When that all became public, the public said, hey, no more. And we had courageous members of Congress who served on the Frank Church Committee.
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:18:00.600]  It was headed by Senator Frank Church, who exposed 90%, not all, but 90% of the cards.
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:10.600]  And they talked about what COINTELPRO, what the FBI had done against Dr. King, what the FBI had done against the anti-war movement.
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:25.600]  They talked about what they had done, what the CIA had done in targeted assassination. All of the cards were laid out so that the American people would have an idea of what their government was doing.
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:37.600]  Now we have the most secrecy, and this is coming from a president who said that there was going to be transparency introduced in government.
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:50.600]  So the whole thing is rotten. Now, what is it that we have to do, Alex, in order to cut out?
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:19:01.600]  We have to excise that part that's rotten and then try and rejuvenate it with healthy organisms.
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:18.600]  The healthy organisms, that's us. That's us. And so the first thing that we have to do is defend ourselves and make sure that the government doesn't encroach on us any more than it already has.
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:27.600]  I agree. Former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney is there, and we'll put her Facebook up on screen. What's the best way for people to find your Facebook, just type in Cynthia McKinney Facebook?
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:31.600]  Cynthia McKinney official, because there's about six or seven of them.
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:33.600]  I understand. It's the one with the sunflowers on it.
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:35.600]  That's right, the one with the sunflowers.
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:47.600]  All right, we'll be right back. Folks, we've got to identify this system as illegitimate first, point out it's criminal, and then we've got to get together and start saying no and have unity. That's what they're scared of.

[02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:09.600]  I said Obama sent a tornado to Oklahoma.
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:11.600]  Said no such thing.
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:17.600]  But they say I'm deeply racist and they don't even show a clip of me saying anything deeply racist.
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:19.600]  They show nothing.
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:23.600]  That's what they would do with her is just harass her, not let her in the Capitol.
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:25.600]  Act like she did something wrong.
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:28.600]  Just basic Cointel Pro garbage.
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:32.600]  They will do stuff like, you know, go to people's preachers.
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:38.600]  And most big preachers at mega churches are now FBI infregard assets on record.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:44.600]  They try to recruit every dentist my dad knows to spy on people and they tell them, you know, leave your husband or leave your wife.
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:46.600]  They have the persons politically active.
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:48.600]  The preachers tell them that.
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:50.600]  They've got most of the authority figures.
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:54.600]  The average authority figure gets approached by the FBI or the CIA and they go, I'm a secret agent.
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:56.600]  I get an infregard card.
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:24:58.600]  I get a clergy response team card.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:04.600]  And then you tell people, hey, most of these big mega church preachers are government agents now.
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:06.600]  And people just don't even believe it.
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:08.600]  Because well, that's not a free country.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:09.600]  That's not happening.
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:12.600]  Cynthia McKinney finishing up in the short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:15.600]  I'm going to get into what's happening around the world and where you see things going.
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.600]  The finishing up with what you were getting to about how to stop this.
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:23.600]  And I mean, you're a go getter.
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:24.600]  I think we need courage.
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:27.600]  Look what you did exposing the trillions missing at the Pentagon.
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:30.600]  Look at what you did exposing the government pedophile rings.
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:32.600]  Look at what you did exposing it all.
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.600]  They didn't even deny it when you brought it all up, but they look scared.
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:41.600]  And so they threw everything they had against you to kick you out of Congress to put a guy in there that thinks islands float.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:46.600]  You're so right.
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:48.600]  It's true.
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:49.600]  It is true.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:51.600]  It's surreal.
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:58.600]  And the thing that I would ask people to do is just before, please go to the polls and vote.
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:07.600]  But before you press the button for that person, that candidate, please know something about that candidate.
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:12.600]  And that is something that I believe too many people do.
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:15.600]  They are committed to voting or either they don't vote.
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:19.600]  And if they are committed to voting, then they don't know for whom to vote.
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:28.600]  So we've got to do a better job of putting the word out and getting the message out and grilling these candidates,
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:35.600]  grilling these people who want to be our representatives in power,
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:40.600]  whether it's the Congress or the state legislature or the city council or the school board.
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:42.600]  We've just got to do a better job.
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:47.600]  And the other thing I think that's important is that we've got to test ourselves.
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:52.600]  We have got to become courageous.
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:55.600]  And that means being fearless.
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:59.600]  That means conquering our fear, not necessarily being fearless.
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:02.600]  I won't say that, but conquering our fear.
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:13.600]  So for example, Alex, I have always been this, you know, sort of gun control type person until I saw the excesses.
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:17.600]  And I said, okay, I'm not in favor of gun control anymore.
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:19.600]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:29.600]  But, you know, that took a lot of courage to do that because that's totally new territory for somebody like me.
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:35.600]  Oh, that's sacrilege for a true liberal like Thomas Jefferson, a true Democrat.
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:37.600]  But nowadays, I mean, that's a sacrament.
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:40.600]  You don't say you're pro-gun, but you did that.
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:41.600]  You had the courage.
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  That's right. That's right.
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:46.600]  And, you know, I'm out here now.
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.600]  I'm out here, but I'm confident.
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:53.600]  I believe in my stance.
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:58.600]  And I know that the Founding Fathers put the Second Amendment in there for a reason.
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:05.600]  And it's probably because of things like the development of this infra-guard that you're talking about
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:09.600]  and the Department of Homeland Security and these purchases of ammunition
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:15.600]  on and on and on the obliteration of the Bill of Rights.
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:19.600]  The Constitution doesn't even look like itself any longer.
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:22.600]  And this is something that we've allowed to take place.
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:25.600]  Well said. This is a short segment, a long segment coming up.
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:28.600]  What do you want to get into first when we come back?
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:31.600]  Obviously, geopolitically, where things are going, I want to get into Ukraine.
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:34.600]  Your take on Venezuela, you've traveled there, I know.
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:39.600]  You've traveled to Libya, I want to look back. They now admit Libya is ten times worse than it was.
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:41.600]  A total disaster, as you showed it would be.
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:47.600]  But briefly, in one minute, what do you think Obama's legacy is going to be?
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:52.600]  Impotence. That's what I think.
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:54.600]  Rubber stamp.
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:58.600]  Rubber stamp.
[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:04.600]  The United States that has lost its way without leadership.
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:13.600]  Sort of runaway lack of leadership, lack of personality, lack of being.
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:17.600]  And I think people have to ask themselves,
[02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:20.600]  what does it mean to be a citizen of the United States now?
[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:24.600]  This is a question that we're going to have to answer for ourselves
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:26.600]  to be able to chart a way forward.
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:29.600]  We've got to look in the mirror, like V from Vendetta says.
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:32.600]  Cynthia McKinney, always a fireball of great ideas.
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:34.600]  We'll be right back with her straight ahead.
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:36.600]  See, this is Cynthia, they won't let you hear.
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:40.600]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:46.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:50.600]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself,
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:54.600]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:56.600]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:29:56.600 --> 02:30:00.600]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:02.600]  of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:06.600]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:07.600]  within their homes.
[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:10.600]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:14.600]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:17.600]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:19.600]  they're allergic to as well.
[02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:22.600]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me
[02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:27.600]  it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:29.600]  that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:34.600]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:38.600]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:40.600]  that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:50.600]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:53.600]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:56.600]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers
[02:30:56.600 --> 02:31:00.600]  that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds
[02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:01.600]  that the body needs.
[02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:04.600]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:08.600]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO
[02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:11.600]  organic super male vitality formula

[02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:03.600]  He aligns himself with the truth
[02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:06.600]  and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:13.600]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:18.600]  In the construction
[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:23.600]  In the fields of bodies burning
[02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:29.600]  As the war machine keeps turning
[02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:32.600]  Death and hatred to mankind
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:36.600]  Poisoning their brainwashed minds
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:41.600]  Official Cynthia McKinney at Facebook
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:46.600]  Holder claims vast amount of discretion in enforcing federal laws
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:51.600]  and Obama more than ever is acting as an executive branch dictatorship
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:53.600]  which they'll pass on to the Republicans.
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:57.600]  That's why the Republicans haven't really been trying to shoot any of this power grab down
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:02.600]  because the special interests that own both parties want authoritarianism.
[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:07.600]  Look at how the CIA in every case doesn't put in new good elected governments
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:12.600]  they put in dictatorships, they put in al-Qaeda
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:16.600]  they overthrow Ukraine and then Russia grabs a tiny part of it
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:20.600]  and they say Russia invaded. I'm not romanticizing Russia.
[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:23.600]  It's just the facts, folks.
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:27.600]  The US would NATO attack Russia in 888 in Georgia
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:33.600]  and seeing it in, that was a big learning experience for me that morning when I woke up
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:38.600]  my wife's like, look, Russia's attacked Georgia and I walk in at like 7.30 in the morning
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:41.600]  turn on the TV and CNN's reporting Russia has attacked Georgia.
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:45.600]  It took me two hours to look at foreign press and they later admitted it
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:49.600]  that they'd attacked Russian military bases on the border and killed everybody.
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:53.600]  Folks, that's dangerous media when they do stuff like that
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:58.600]  and I wanted to go back to Cynthia McKinney because I know she's very well traveled around the world
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:03.600]  we can pull up articles where they now admit in the Christian Science Monitor you name it
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:10.600]  that Libya is a hellhole compared to an Oasis that it was for the development of Africa.
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:14.600]  In the Coney 2012 scam they're now invading 8 different African countries for resources
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:20.600]  Africa is a con and look, you've got to have Obama as the front man to do it
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:24.600]  if Bush would have tried it no one would have ever gone along with this.
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:28.600]  Cynthia, I just threw out the waterfront on international situation.
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:30.600]  What do you want to get into first?
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:37.600]  Well, Ukraine demonstrates the purposeful destabilization policy of the United States
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:45.600]  and you're right to point out that these things are being done by fiat really.
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:50.600]  If you've got fiat money, you can government by fiat as well
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:55.600]  but you've got the death penalty for US citizens by executive order
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:00.600]  and you also got the death penalty for entire countries.
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:08.600]  That's what we are witnessing and so Ukraine might not ever be the same again.
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:12.600]  Look at the destruction that's going on in Syria.
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:19.600]  I was in Syria at the time that Assad granted the interview to Fox
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:25.600]  and Dennis Kucinich was there and there were bombs going up
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:28.600]  but I got some experience in that.
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:34.600]  But I noticed how some people were running and cringing and crouching
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:43.600]  and every time there was this big, thunderous jolt to the hotel that we were in
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:52.600]  but Syria is not going to be the same again for a very long time.
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:58.600]  So you can just go right down the line and you're pointing out that's the mission is destabilization.
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:04.600]  It's wreck the country, break it in three parts, turn al-Qaeda over to be in control
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:09.600]  and then lecture us to give our rights up all day because al-Qaeda is hiding under the desk.
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:16.600]  Now what I've done, you know that I've taken a break, a one hour break just so I could talk to you
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:23.600]  and then I'm going to turn immediately back to my PhD work and I'm working on Venezuela.
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:28.600]  One of the things that came out of WikiLeaks and I've gone through all of the documents,
[02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:37.600]  some 2200 documents on Hugo Chavez, greatly sanitized I have to say
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:44.600]  but I'm happy that we at least have these documents to look at whether they're sanitized or not
[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:48.600]  because they can't sanitize everything out of them.
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:55.600]  And this organization from the global intelligence files which were the strat for,
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:05.600]  which is right there in Texas, the strat for intelligence emails that were sent out,
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:12.600]  to discover that there's this whole sort of backwash of US policy.
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:18.600]  This is not anything new because it happened under the COINTELPRO program
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:25.600]  but it seems now to have been outsourced to these various shadowy organizations,
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:31.600]  Blackwater or whatever, you know, and then they do the dirty work
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:36.600]  still at the end of the day paid for by us taxpayers.
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:49.600]  So what I have discovered is that the up pour that helped in the destabilization of Serbia,
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:55.600]  which led then to the downfall of Milosevic and that's someone that I met.
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:39:03.600]  I met on that congressional delegation that was led by, well, it was a delegation
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:07.600]  that had members of Congress on it that was led by Hobro.
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:13.600]  And so we sat there and I had a chance to meet Milosevic
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:17.600]  and unfortunately, you know, this is the way our government seems to operate,
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:23.600]  is that you get these members of Congress who really don't know anything other
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:28.600]  than what they've been told by the very people who are creating the problem
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:36.600]  and then they go in and spout the same stuff without having done the background work.
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:39.600]  Well, anyway, Milosevic is brought down.
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:44.600]  This organization, up pour, establishes a relationship,
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:49.600]  the leadership of up pour establishes a relationship with the folks at Stratford
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:54.600]  before you know it, you've got the exact same thing happening.
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:56.600]  Now it's happening in Venezuela.
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:01.600]  So up pour has a playbook.
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:06.600]  And if we look at the playbook, then we can see it happening.
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:17.600]  We can see it being implemented in Ukraine, in Iran, in Libya, over and over and over again.
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:23.600]  So now the question that the people of the United States have to ask themselves
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:28.600]  is, is this what we want our government to do?
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:34.600]  Is this something that we are proud of as citizens of the United States?
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:41.600]  Is our government acting with our values as it acts in our name?
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:46.600]  And if the answer is no, then we have to do something about it.
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:50.600]  We have to resist. We have to find our courage.
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:57.600]  We have to find that courage, overcome the fear once we've informed ourselves
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:00.600]  and say, okay, we're going to do something different.
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:05.600]  And so that's why one of the things I really probably shouldn't say anything
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:10.600]  because I haven't, you know, sort of sourced this out yet.
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:12.600]  Finish codifying it all, yeah.
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:14.600]  Yeah, but this is my idea.
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:21.600]  My idea is they want us to maintain walls of separation
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:26.600]  among the people of the United States, among the people who are footing the bill.
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:30.600]  No, no, they admit divide and conquer. They admit divide and conquer. Yeah, that's the...
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:38.600]  So why not have some of us come together and go around the United States?
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:43.600]  Let's have someone from the extreme, extreme far right.
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:47.600]  They're telling me that the militia is my enemy.
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:50.600]  I don't know that that militia is my enemy.
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:53.600]  And I guarantee you if I talk to people who are a part of the militia,
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:59.600]  maybe we'll find out that there's at least some level at which we can work together.
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:01.600]  Oh, Cynthia, the real militia guaranteed...
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:04.600]  Listen, you right now agree with almost everything you're saying.
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:07.600]  And again, that's what the issue is. They want everybody scared to death.
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:12.600]  There's the Ron Paul Realty Party that was bullhorning Republicans and Democrats.
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:16.600]  Then the Republicans tried to take that over to get the Democrats to hate it,
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:18.600]  to create another divide and conquer. That failed.
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:23.600]  So now the Republican leadership with the Democrats has given money to kill the Realty Party.
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:29.600]  And then they don't want, quote, minorities to think they could be pro-gun or they could be pro-sovereignty.
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:32.600]  This is how they've done a number on everybody.
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:35.600]  And but we have pro-gun marches that have got everybody out there and we love it.
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:36.600]  And it scares the system.
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:38.600]  I'm briefly getting back to Stratford.
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:42.600]  We've been over there probably 10 times in the last decade trying to get an interview from these people.
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:44.600]  They always have their security guards throw us out.
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:45.600]  In fact, we ought to show that sometime.
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:51.600]  But the point is, is that Stratford, when the emails came out and we have it up on screen,
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:58.600]  wanted to show bin Laden body photos to shut up lunatics like Alex Jones and Glenn Beck saying it was fake.
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:05.600]  And then we track back people that it looks like are connected into them once all that comes out,
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:08.600]  trying to then say that I worked for them.
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:14.600]  So see, that's how sophisticated Cohen tell pro is, is that when it came out, they had operations that discredited us.
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:23.600]  Immediately, all these people started saying we were with them to smoke screen the fact that this CIA front group was coming after me.
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:25.600]  See how sophisticated that is?
[02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:27.600]  Well, it's very sophisticated.
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:31.600]  And that's why we have to be able to snuff it out and smell it out.
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:37.600]  And the only way we can know what's in the playbook is to study what's in the what's been in the playbook in the past.
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:44.600]  And this kind of they call it bad jacketing where they put out a lie that in fact,
[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:53.600]  a member of the American Indian movement, Anna May picked to I quash was murdered because they said that she wasn't an FBI informant.
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:58.600]  And all she was was a very promising leader for the American Indian movement.
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:43:59.600]  Amazing.
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:03.600]  Well, that's why Cass Sunstein at the White House said create infighting.
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:08.600]  And that's why anybody you see out there who isn't talking about issues, who isn't talking about freedom,
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:10.600]  who isn't talking about the basic bill of rights,
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:15.600]  but who's talking about infighting all day and attacking other people, you can bet your bottom dollar.
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:17.600]  They're the real operative.
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:19.600]  They're the real informant.
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:27.600]  Well, now that's why I decided that once I finished with this very intense work that I'm doing right now,
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:37.600]  I would like to reach out to four or five folks and then we just travel all different political persuasions.
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:45.600]  And we just travel around the country as a group and we have like town hall meetings where we talk.
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:57.600]  And I think that just by doing that, it will have an audience that is as diverse as the people who are on the panel.
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:01.600]  And then we just sit down and talk and we let our hearts open.
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:07.600]  So we're not concerned about, well, did I use the wrong word or did I say it the wrong way?
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:16.600]  All that political correctness stuff will be thrown out for the moment so that we can be honest with each other.
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:17.600]  Sure, well, that's all done.
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:22.600]  Just stifle real debate and to make everybody so scared of everybody and new political correctness,
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:27.600]  this modern thing is to overwrite what Martin Luther King came out with and was saying as common sense,
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:31.600]  judge people on the character of their deeds, their content and what they do, they stand for,
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:36.600]  for what's going on in their heart, soul and mind, not off what religion or color they are.
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:41.600]  Now they've taken a liberal movement, turned it on its head and made it all about what group are you in
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:46.600]  so that you cease to be an individual so you can't interface with other individuals.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:51.600]  You've now got to operate as a group and then you've got to operate with a leader telling you what to do.
[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:52.600]  That's exactly right.
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:59.600]  And as long as things are that way, then the same old folks stay in charge.
[02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:08.600]  There's one thing, Alex, that I've been immersed in Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, WikiLeaks, global intelligence files.
[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:18.600]  You know, I had another stalker and he was from Texas and I didn't know until I was into those global intelligence files
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:21.600]  that Stratford was in Texas.
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:33.600]  I'm just wondering, I just, you know, I'm just wondering, why is it that folk who come to me in ways that are unwanted by me
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:35.600]  seem to come from Texas?
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:42.600]  Well, I can tell you, Texas has been a just absolute hotbed of clandestine operations.
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:46.600]  It shows New Mexico and it's because a lot of the drugs are brought in here.
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:51.600]  Look at Arkansas and Mina, I mean, that's one of the big issues.
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:47:01.600]  Well, did you talk about, I know you talked about the Malaysian playing, but did you talk about the two sets of war games that were going on?
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:04.600]  There was Cope Tiger and Cobra Gold.
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:06.600]  Did you talk about them?
[02:47:06.600 --> 02:47:07.600]  Yes, I know.
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:10.600]  The whole thing's very suspicious and obviously there's a cover up.
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:11.600]  You've got a lot of sources.
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:13.600]  What do you think happened?
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:24.600]  Well, I don't know what happened, but I spoke to the former Chief of Staff, to the former Prime Minister in Malaysia.
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:26.600]  And this is what he said.
[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:36.600]  He said that instead of trying to figure out how this was done, he said we ought to, he's a lawyer as well.
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:43.600]  He said we need to focus on who is, he said, who is the main question?
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:48.600]  Who has the motive and the capability to disappear playing?
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:48:05.600]  He reminded me about the satellites, Diego Garcia, the NSA, and the improbability of losing an airplane when you've got war games going on in the region.
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:12.600]  The beginning before the disappearance and then after the disappearance.
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:18.600]  And, you know, there are not very many countries that do have that kind of a capability.
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:32.600]  Now, what he likes to put forward is this notion that the intelligence war that's going on between East and West,
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:39.600]  between the United States and the Five Eyes, and what China might have,
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:49.600]  and that the poor people on the plane are being held in the middle of this now,
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:55.600]  or the families and the people on the plane are in the middle of this great intelligence war
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:02.600]  as to who has the capability and who's going to disclose the capability that they have.
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:04.600]  That's what, that's his take on it.
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:05.600]  That's right.
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:09.600]  Who brought it down by remote control, which all these planes now have on board,
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:15.600]  and then it becomes a big, you know, blackmail by some party to reveal all this.
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:18.600]  Plus, you have a brain heist with all these top scientists on board.
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:20.600]  Cynthia, we've only got a few minutes left.
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:23.600]  It's always great to have you and I hope you'll come back more often.
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:25.600]  We can take some calls next time.
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:31.600]  Briefly, 6% approval rating for Congress in some polls, 9% and 10% in others.
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:33.600]  Almost everybody I know doesn't laugh at me anymore.
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:34.600]  They don't laugh at you.
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:35.600]  They say, yeah, we're in trouble.
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:36.600]  What do you do about it?
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:39.600]  As there's a total loss of confidence in the system,
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:45.600]  I don't think the police state's going to be able to protect the establishment.
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:48.600]  Um, I hope you're right.
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:49.600]  I hope you're right.
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:55.600]  And what is going to take is us being together and being able to communicate with one another.
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:02.600]  That's why your show is so important because you have people on there from all walks of life.
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:10.600]  And therefore you are providing a service for us to be able to communicate no matter where,
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:11.600]  what my background is.
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:14.600]  I feel the same as you on the second amendment.
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:17.600]  I feel the same as you on the bill of rights.
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:20.600]  I feel the same as you on the future of our country.
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:24.600]  I feel the same as you on what our country is currently doing,
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:28.600]  domestically, as well as to the rest of the world.
[02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:33.600]  So how can we magnify what you are able to bring?
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:34.600]  And what you've done.
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:38.600]  Cynthia McKinney, folks can check out your Facebook, official Cynthia McKinney.
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:39.600]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:41.600]  I look forward to talking to you again soon.
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:42.600]  Thank you.
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:43.600]  She's awesome.
[02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:47.600]  Leanne McAdoo's report, I promise you're going to get it coming up.
[02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:16.600]  Go to PrivacyLockdown.com.
[02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:48.600]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:53.600]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhog and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:56.600]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment,
[02:51:56.600 --> 02:51:59.600]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed,
[02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:02.600]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:06.600]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[02:52:06.600 --> 02:52:10.600]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:52:10.600 --> 02:52:16.600]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women.
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:19.600]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:25.600]  And that's why I stock MyPantry with high quality storeable foods from MyPatriot Supply.
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:27.600]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com.
[02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:36.600]  For special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:49.600]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:52:49.600 --> 02:52:51.600]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:52:51.600 --> 02:52:56.600]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers that lower our testosterone
[02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:59.600]  and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:03.600]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others,
[02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:10.600]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula
[02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:16.600]  sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:24.600]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:30.600]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:56.600]  They railed against the crown another ragtag band declaring independence.
[02:53:56.600 --> 02:54:02.600]  The enemy's technologies of manipulation are advanced, but if you're aware of how they operate,
[02:54:02.600 --> 02:54:05.600]  we can transcend it and have a future together.
[02:54:05.600 --> 02:54:08.600]  And as things get worse and worse, people will be looking for solutions.
[02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:14.600]  By the way, you've been hearing on the show more and more little excerpts from the 30 minute nightly news.

[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:21.600]  I mean, it's, when it goes on television, it's going to be very popular.
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:26.600]  It's already on some television systems out there, but it's SubscriberPrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:44.600]  The great reporters, myself, all of it.
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:51.600]  Here's Leigh Ann McAdoo's report on the streets of Austin, Texas yesterday.
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:52.600]  She shot it yesterday.
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:53.600]  It aired last night.
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:56.600]  This is the type of reporting you see every night.
[02:54:56.600 --> 02:54:58.600]  Sometimes taped to air, sometimes live.
[02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:01.600]  You're playing, you know, the tape clips on the nightly news.
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:05.600]  And of course we have expanded live coverage during elections and things like that as well.
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:07.600]  All the films are online and so much more.
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:09.600]  And you're supporting the very tip of the spear in free independent media.
[02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:11.600]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:15.600]  Here is Leigh Ann McAdoo's report on Obamacare.
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:19.600]  I'm standing on South Lamar in downtown Austin right in front of P. Terry's burger stand.
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:22.600]  P. Terry's is a very popular local business.
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:23.600]  People come here.
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:29.600]  They flock here because they are hungry for the organic, locally sourced beef and produce.
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:30.600]  It's non-GMO.
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:33.600]  They've really become successful on this platform.
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:39.600]  But in spite of all of that success, P. Terry's and other businesses across the nation are now facing a dilemma.
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:45.600]  Will they comply with Obamacare, meaning they're going to have to pay these hefty new insurance rates for their employees
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:48.600]  and pass the cost on to consumers?
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:52.600]  Or will they cut workers' hours so that they're only employing part-time workers?
[02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:58.600]  Or will they pay hefty fines for just not providing insurance to their employees at all?
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:06.600]  Meanwhile, right across the street, huge globalist corporations like McDonald's do not have to comply with the rules of Obamacare.
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:13.600]  They can continue providing subpar insurance to their employees and they won't have to pass the cost on to the consumer.
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:18.600]  Meaning they can continue to sell you fake plastic hamburgers for a dollar.
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:20.600]  Do you think that a law is a law?
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:25.600]  Like, if it's illegal for me to run a red light, shouldn't it be illegal for you to run a red light also?
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:26.600]  Yeah.
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:27.600]  Yes.
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:29.600]  So we're in consensus about that.
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:34.600]  Well, do you think it's right that Obamacare penalties don't apply to big corporations like McDonald's
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:41.600]  but across the street at P. Terry's, they're going to have to either pay hefty fines or cut back employee hours?
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:43.600]  I think that's wrong.
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:45.600]  I think that's wrong.
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:47.600]  No, that's horrible.
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:48.600]  I didn't know that.
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:55.600]  They don't have to comply with the law, meaning they can continue giving their employees really awful health insurance.
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:57:01.600]  But if they don't apply, what will happen if they don't apply with the law to them?
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:05.600]  Well, nothing is going to happen to them because they've got their buddies in Washington.
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:07.600]  It's the way it is these days, I guess, right?
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:08.600]  What are you going to do?
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:10.600]  What are we going to do?
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:14.600]  Vote and vote with your dollars.
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:21.600]  Would you pay an extra dollar to eat at McDonald's if you knew that it meant that they were giving their employees better insurance?
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:22.600]  No.
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:24.600]  I only eat there because it's a dollar.
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:32.600]  The money that is spent here, for the most part, stays here with the local employees,
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:40.600]  unlike a company like, say, a Home Depot or a Walmart that collects funds, collects money from the local economy,
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:42.600]  and then sucks it out.
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:45.600]  If you have enough money, you can pretty much get away with anything.
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:46.600]  Yeah.
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:53.600]  That seems to be the rich and the big corporations are definitely getting away with not paying their fair share.
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:55.600]  Anything.
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:57:56.600]  Murder.
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:57:59.600]  I mean, I've seen people have a lot of money get away with murder.
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:03.600]  It's going to be posted up on infowars.com.
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:09.600]  And the issue here is that the big corporations are exempt while they lobby for higher taxes on us.
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:14.600]  And they're going to keep doing that until we're all destitute if we don't make them go into the same laws.
[02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:15.600]  Okay?
[02:58:15.600 --> 02:58:16.600]  It's real simple.
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:20.600]  The full report is up on infowars.com and prisonpana.com.
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:23.600]  It'll be more tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:27.600]  At infowars.net we'll be back tomorrow on the radio, Lord willing.
[02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:28.600]  Pray for us.
[02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:29.600]  Pray for America.
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:30.600]  Pray for freedom.
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:31.600]  Great job of the crew.
[02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:32.600]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:51.600]  We're live.com today.
