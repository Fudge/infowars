[00:00.000 --> 00:18.960]  Tonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the nation, revitalizing
[00:18.960 --> 00:24.040]  our democracy, and winning the future for America.
[00:24.040 --> 00:32.440]  I stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day of my administration, 100 days since I
[00:32.440 --> 00:39.000]  took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.120]  we all did that was in crisis, the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since
[00:46.120 --> 00:53.480]  the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War, the worst
[00:53.480 --> 01:02.840]  attack on our republic since the Civil War, what a nightmare image of that corpse that
[01:02.840 --> 01:06.800]  looks like he's been tarted up with some makeup.
[01:06.800 --> 01:15.360]  Stephen Miller called it like watching paint on the old side of a barn, but it's far worse
[01:15.360 --> 01:20.040]  than that, it's watching him rot, it's like watching the soul of our country rot, it's
[01:20.040 --> 01:28.440]  like the portrait of Dorian Gray, simply out of control, and a total lie.
[01:28.440 --> 01:35.000]  We lost 750,000 people during the Civil War, another million died of their complications
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.040]  the next decade, it's estimated, of course, more than 60 million people died in World
[01:41.040 --> 01:45.200]  War II around the world.
[01:45.200 --> 01:49.440]  We all know about Vietnam, we all know about the Cold War, we all know about the issues
[01:49.440 --> 02:00.440]  that have unfolded, but the statement that the worst attack on our democracy whenever
[02:00.440 --> 02:09.160]  we're a republic since the Civil War is just asinine, in fact, that's soldiers that died,
[02:09.160 --> 02:13.080]  they don't have numbers on civilians that died, but it's estimated that millions died
[02:13.080 --> 02:21.200]  during Reconstruction, millions of people is a bigger threat to the country in a Civil
[02:21.200 --> 02:26.720]  War that almost ended the country, is a bigger threat than 400, 500 people going in the capital
[02:26.720 --> 02:31.040]  and maybe 20 of them having a fistfight with the police, and then one cop dies a few days
[02:31.040 --> 02:38.160]  later from injuries that were not sustained in the melee, but from a stroke.
[02:38.160 --> 02:43.040]  That's the reality, but my producer, Scott, made a great point, I kept asking myself,
[02:43.040 --> 02:49.840]  why are they calling it a joint address of Congress held on the same date as they hold
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.320]  State of the Unions, because they don't want a union, they want disunion, everything they
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.360]  do is about dissolving the republic, so they call it a joint address instead of the State
[02:59.360 --> 03:04.520]  of the Union because they want to destroy the union and the republic, and they can't
[03:04.520 --> 03:10.720]  do that if the people still associate America with either, excellent point by our producer
[03:10.720 --> 03:17.720]  Scott Bronson, and that's damn true, and everything he said in the speech telegraphed
[03:17.720 --> 03:31.000]  that, so the headline of the live show today is very telling, Biden disguises communism
[03:31.000 --> 03:41.080]  and globalism as democracy, but in truth, the mad howl of pure democracy, the French
[03:41.080 --> 03:44.760]  Revolution and other events we've seen that leads to so much death and destruction, really
[03:44.760 --> 03:52.680]  is where this is coming from, democracy elected Adolf Hitler, but Biden's even worse when
[03:52.680 --> 03:57.560]  it comes to his electoral history, he was not elected and the evidence is overwhelming,
[03:57.560 --> 04:04.360]  oh, but we hear, oh, national polls, 80 plus percent of people, 87%, 82%, oh, they loved
[04:04.360 --> 04:12.400]  it, they just love him, he's incredible, but all the online polls were 10 to 1, 8 to 1,
[04:12.400 --> 04:17.280]  5 to 1 votes against him, we're doing a little report on that for you coming up today, it's
[04:17.280 --> 04:26.240]  all gas, lighting, propaganda in your face, we're going to analyze what he said in his
[04:26.240 --> 04:29.720]  schizophrenic speech, because a lot of it was lifted from President Trump, from Stephen
[04:29.720 --> 04:35.160]  Miller that wrote the speeches, who's a patriot, a listener of the show, and we're just proud
[04:35.160 --> 04:42.160]  of our influence, your influence supporting us, and then the rest was dog whistles from
[04:42.160 --> 04:46.480]  the globalists and the communists for their takeover of the republic with those two witches
[04:46.480 --> 04:51.480]  wearing their stupid mask in the endless cult of humans are dirty, we're bad, wear the diapers
[04:51.480 --> 04:59.320]  on our faces, the symbol of continual medical dictatorship of this country, this entire
[04:59.320 --> 05:04.600]  new world order system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete, making you
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.480]  a domesticated animal they control, they want to censor you, they want to dump you down,
[05:09.480 --> 05:14.840]  they want to poison you, and they want to control your ability to take care of yourself,
[05:14.840 --> 05:19.840]  ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the info war more than ever, and you can do
[05:19.840 --> 05:24.720]  it while at the same time protecting yourself and your family and your neighbors, we have
[05:24.720 --> 05:29.800]  the biggest best storeable foods company in the world that has high quality food in huge

[06:12.920 --> 06:29.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:29.000 --> 06:37.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, it is April 29th, 2021, and what a difference from
[06:37.760 --> 06:44.640]  President Trump's last State of the Union in 2020 with a packed house full of heroes
[06:44.640 --> 06:52.080]  and patriots and veterans and American success stories, and in Rush Limbaugh there, getting
[06:52.080 --> 07:00.400]  that American freedom medal before he died from the first lady to a virtue signaling
[07:00.400 --> 07:10.680]  gallery with only the first puppet lady, the first zombie lady, and a few other people
[07:10.680 --> 07:16.240]  like the Vice President Nancy Pelosi wearing mummy mask behind them, I mean this is you
[07:16.240 --> 07:23.120]  wake up in a dystopic fever dream nightmare, and this is it, and the message is this is
[07:23.120 --> 07:28.000]  not the people's house, we know you don't like us, we know you protest everywhere, we
[07:28.000 --> 07:34.920]  know when big tech comes and lies to Congress that everybody gets in their face, and so
[07:34.920 --> 07:42.040]  now we're going to shut everything down, constant virtue signaling, and of course they have
[07:42.040 --> 07:47.280]  house and senate meetings all the time, and they're jam-packed in there, but for last
[07:47.280 --> 07:53.560]  night to show you how dangerous things are, the Kabuki Theater, they only had one-fifth
[07:53.560 --> 07:59.800]  of those who were in the Congress allowed to attend, who said that, who agreed to that
[07:59.800 --> 08:07.040]  as the rules of the house and the senate, this is just dictatorship on top of dictatorship
[08:07.040 --> 08:18.920]  all built on cult-like mindless obedience, and then Biden got into the meat of what
[08:18.920 --> 08:27.440]  he's doing, he would coat the poison pill of globalism and transhumanism and communism
[08:27.440 --> 08:31.760]  with quotes from Trump, quotes from Stephen Miller that wrote most of those speeches,
[08:31.760 --> 08:35.080]  the speeches were collaborative effort, Trump added quite a bit, but Miller at least half
[08:35.080 --> 08:44.200]  of it, Miller influencing Trump on Americanism not globalism will be our credo, and we see
[08:44.200 --> 08:49.000]  the numbers of national polls claiming, oh, it was a fabulous speech, everyone loved it,
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.760]  you don't look at the downvotes, they're 10 to 1, 5 to 1, 8 to 1, this guy is super
[08:54.760 --> 09:02.840]  unpopular, that is the reality, and no amount of gaslighting is ever going to change that,
[09:02.840 --> 09:07.240]  and I want to go over some of these nightmare clips, and we have a special guest joining
[09:07.240 --> 09:13.920]  us in the second hour to be talking about this more, Laura Chinn, great talk show host
[09:13.920 --> 09:21.440]  over at the Blaze, and then Dr. Jane Ruby is coming on to talk about in the third hour
[09:21.440 --> 09:26.640]  we're going to hit at the bottom of the hour, that is incredible, you've heard a lot about
[09:26.640 --> 09:32.320]  this even before the vaccine started, we told you about this 8 months ago, and then again
[09:32.320 --> 09:40.040]  6 months ago, but now it's big top stories, because people are getting sick that have
[09:40.040 --> 09:43.240]  been around people that have been vaccinated, and 80-year-old, 90-year-old women are having
[09:43.240 --> 09:48.200]  menstrual cycles, hadn't had them in 30, 40, 50 years, and people are getting fevers around
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.560]  people that have had the vaccine, and it's in the literature that it makes you contagious,
[09:52.560 --> 10:00.080]  shedding is just a fancy term for being contagious, kind of like it's street slang, you're going
[10:00.080 --> 10:05.960]  to shoot somebody to bust a cap in their ass, because the cap is what the hammer hits, the
[10:05.960 --> 10:11.200]  firing pin hits that shoots the bullet down the barrel that ignites the powder and shoots
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.960]  the bullet down the barrel called bust a cap in your ass, well when they say they're shedding
[10:16.960 --> 10:21.120]  it's like saying I'm going to bust a cap in your ass, that's the same thing as I'm contagious,
[10:21.120 --> 10:24.960]  I'm going to give you something worse than COVID-19, and we're going to show you directly
[10:24.960 --> 10:32.880]  from the documents in a report that just so happened to be completed today by the great,
[10:32.880 --> 10:37.360]  Greg Rees, and we're not a competition around here, we just love to celebrate success, he
[10:37.360 --> 10:41.960]  consistently now is getting about a million views per video, and the great part is there's
[10:41.960 --> 10:47.520]  no Alex Jones on them, and so people are repurposing them and posting them all over the internet,
[10:47.520 --> 10:52.880]  and in fact we're just putting out a version that is bug-free, so M4 doesn't even get credit,
[10:52.880 --> 10:56.720]  we don't even want the credit, we don't care, we just want to defeat the New World Order
[10:56.720 --> 11:04.200]  and their giant genocide operation, through their soft kill medical operation, so get
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.240]  the videos, edit them, share them, cut them down, expand them, do whatever you want, just
[11:08.240 --> 11:15.360]  use it all, the new video, vaccine shedding, causing miscarriages and blood clots in females,
[11:15.360 --> 11:23.320]  particularly in unvaccinated females, and it's a nice three and a half minute briefing,
[11:23.320 --> 11:26.440]  great to share, great to save lives, and if you put it on your Facebook, you put it on
[11:26.440 --> 11:30.760]  your Twitter, if you share it with your friends that found it on your email or text message,
[11:30.760 --> 11:38.400]  you will save lives, because this is definitely their big move right now, so we're going to
[11:38.400 --> 11:41.680]  go to break about four or five minutes, I'm going to come back and drill into the state
[11:41.680 --> 11:48.000]  of the global estate cover, the joint session, which they call the joint address instead
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.920]  of the state of the union, because they want to destroy the union and the republic, and
[11:52.920 --> 11:58.080]  they can't do that if people still associate America with either, that is coming up next
[11:58.080 --> 12:03.680]  segment, and then more on that in the second hour with Laura Chin, look at this nightmare
[12:03.680 --> 12:12.960]  cult we're in, wow, the Pelosi and the other puppet Kamala Harris with their damn mask
[12:12.960 --> 12:16.840]  on, they're never going to stop, and their cult followers are never going to pull the
[12:16.840 --> 12:20.760]  mask off, it's their cult of their criminal takeover, the symbol that they're dirty and
[12:20.760 --> 12:25.440]  they're bad, and they're a criminal gang, and it's the October Revolution 2.0, I mean
[12:25.440 --> 12:30.480]  they admit that's what this is, financed by the fabulously rich Rothschilds that funded
[12:30.480 --> 12:39.040]  the first, go around 100, and four years ago, we are in a lot of trouble, boys and girls,
[12:39.040 --> 12:46.640]  but look at the sacks of garbage they got to recruit to do this to us, now separately,
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.040]  people are ready to hear the truth now more than ever, and that's why if you spread the
[12:50.040 --> 12:56.920]  word about this broadcast, people are really ready to receive the truth, and I talked about
[12:56.920 --> 13:01.080]  the fact that we've been instrumental in really waking Tucker Carlson up, instrumental in
[13:01.080 --> 13:07.800]  influencing Rush Limbaugh, instrumental in influencing Sean Hannity, he's told us that,
[13:07.800 --> 13:11.960]  you've seen the Republicans come a long way, being radicalized as Americans, because we
[13:11.960 --> 13:16.760]  hit the bar bar first and covered agenda 21, agenda 2030 in the New World Order and the
[13:16.760 --> 13:21.480]  pedophile ranks, and now that's all entered the general vernacular, and people understand
[13:21.480 --> 13:26.440]  it's Americanism versus globalism, it's freedom versus slavery, that's why it's more important
[13:26.440 --> 13:32.840]  to never keep us on air, we make it easy, we're self-funded by viewers like you, and so that's
[13:32.840 --> 13:40.680]  why I am really, really encouraging listeners to go to infowarstore.com and get products
[13:40.680 --> 13:45.080]  that you absolutely desperately need, that are essential to your health and wellness,
[13:45.080 --> 13:50.920]  all the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals are in our wonderful product, vitamin
[13:50.920 --> 13:55.320]  mineral fusions, so it's liquid, so you absorb more of it than what you do with most capsules,
[13:55.880 --> 14:00.120]  or all capsules, it's got chemino acids for uploading it, and despite the fact it's closest
[14:00.120 --> 14:05.560]  selling out, it's still discounted at infowarstore.com, then vitamin D3, which is also in winter
[14:05.560 --> 14:10.840]  sun, at a higher dose is king, it's the big one you need for your immune system, all of them work
[14:10.840 --> 14:18.040]  in concert, it's available at infowarstore.com as well, also discounted, but back in stock is
[14:19.160 --> 14:23.240]  our ultimate turmeric formula, 95% of human oil, it's also a very good immune system, but also
[14:23.240 --> 14:31.240]  joints, and a lot of other parts of the body, anti-inflammatory support, flexibility support,
[14:31.240 --> 14:37.000]  and much more, it is 50% off, and so is vaso-beads, that's great for the heart, cardiovascular system,
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.320]  and the liver, creates the nitrous oxide in the blood, it's a great product, people love it,
[14:41.320 --> 14:47.880]  it's at infowarstore.com, also 50% off, but I can tell you, because we're so close to already not
[14:47.880 --> 14:54.280]  being able to have these products because of supply chain breakdowns, we are going to end the sale
[14:54.280 --> 15:00.760]  on body's ultimate turmeric formula on Tuesday, it'll be over, because it'll be, looks like,
[15:00.760 --> 15:05.080]  8 to 12 weeks if we're lucky, till more comes in, because we can't even get as much as we want,
[15:05.080 --> 15:11.240]  we got a limited order, so it'll go to 25% off starting next Tuesday, and that'll still probably
[15:11.240 --> 15:15.720]  sell out in a month, but we got a full price right now, and it would sell out before we got more in,
[15:15.720 --> 15:19.080]  but I want those of you on the fence who haven't experienced it to get it, because I believe
[15:19.080 --> 15:23.240]  you'll keep reordering it, it'll make your life a lot better, so body's ultimate turmeric formula
[15:23.240 --> 15:29.960]  available at infowarstore.com, or triple A 253-3139, it's a staple, we've been sold out for three,
[15:29.960 --> 15:33.080]  four, five months, at least I haven't had it at the house for three months, almost six months
[15:33.080 --> 15:37.640]  sold out, and I was like, man, and I got it some in last week, sort of gobbling it and
[15:37.640 --> 15:41.640]  inflammation, instantly went down to my face, everybody could see it, and that's just how
[15:41.640 --> 15:45.720]  powerful it is, it's how amazing it is, and how de-stressing it is at a metabolic level,
[15:45.720 --> 15:49.720]  so it's all available at infowarstore.com, oh, and two more things are close to selling out,
[15:49.720 --> 15:53.880]  they're still discounted, 40% off, that's rocket rest, and down and out, sleep aids,
[15:53.880 --> 16:02.440]  we'll be right back, stay with us. CNN has almost no viewers, the ADL is reviled and hated across
[16:02.440 --> 16:06.920]  the United States and the world as a pack of anti-free speech liars, but that doesn't mean
[16:06.920 --> 16:10.760]  that they don't have power, just like the Southern Poverty Law Center, that's just as bad, they
[16:10.760 --> 16:15.560]  represent the globalist, the big power structure, that wants authoritarianism, and backs communist
[16:15.560 --> 16:20.600]  China and its death camps, and they back bringing those similar systems here to America, and they've
[16:20.600 --> 16:26.520]  even officially called the ADL for my arrest for my speech, and for Mark Zuckerberg to be arrested
[16:26.520 --> 16:31.400]  for free speech as well, these are very, very dangerous times, they don't want us to be on air,
[16:31.400 --> 16:36.840]  you funding our operation is critical, you make it easy at infowarstore.com with amazing products
[16:36.840 --> 16:42.280]  like water filtration, air filtration, non-geoma heirloom seats, t-shirts, books, films, and now

[16:46.280 --> 16:51.880]  formula, vaso beets, prostaguard, alpha power, and more, back in stock, and it keeps us on air,
[16:51.880 --> 16:53.240]  despite what the pirates want.
[16:53.240 --> 17:04.840]  Randy Dewright, Randy Dewright, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[17:04.840 --> 17:10.440]  Challenge, first of all, let me say, I love your products, I am a granny, and for all the
[17:10.440 --> 17:15.400]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with
[17:15.400 --> 17:21.320]  sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called, but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[17:21.320 --> 17:28.920]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually, people think I'm 55 years old, and I was already
[17:28.920 --> 17:33.240]  taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do,
[17:33.240 --> 17:37.320]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started taking it, I mean,
[17:37.320 --> 17:43.160]  it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you
[17:43.160 --> 17:48.920]  know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on
[17:48.920 --> 17:55.400]  derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[17:55.400 --> 18:15.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:25.400 --> 18:41.880]  And who are you, my friend? Who are you?
[18:55.800 --> 19:03.880]  What's live?
[19:05.240 --> 19:11.880]  Biden announces communist globalist agenda disguised as democracy in a dress to Congress.
[19:11.880 --> 19:20.040]  What if I say I'm not like the others? What if I say I'm not just another one in your place?
[19:20.040 --> 19:26.200]  You're the pretenders. What if I say I will never say that? All right, let's get into it right now,
[19:26.200 --> 19:33.720]  my friends. This was a declaration of war against what's left of the free market economy by the
[19:33.720 --> 19:38.440]  big mega banks, by big tech that are using lockdowns and shutdowns to consolidate control.
[19:38.440 --> 19:44.280]  After they bankrupt you, after they destroy what you've got to be self-sufficient and well
[19:44.280 --> 19:50.680]  off and upwardly mobile, they then offer you a tiny life raft the size of a postage stamp,
[19:50.680 --> 19:55.480]  so that as you sink into oblivion, you won't be angry at them, and they can cast themselves
[19:57.000 --> 20:05.240]  as the hero. They call it the joint address, even though for the entire history of this country,
[20:05.240 --> 20:12.040]  it's been the State of the Union. Instead, they called it the joint address instead of the State
[20:12.040 --> 20:16.600]  of the Union because they want to destroy the Union and Republic, and they can't do that if people
[20:16.600 --> 20:28.200]  still associate America with either. But if they can say we're a pure democracy, well a 51% vote to
[20:28.200 --> 20:31.960]  say whites are inherently bad and they've got to pay taxes because they're white, they've got to pay
[20:31.960 --> 20:37.640]  special fines, well then it happens. Or a 51% say black people are inherently bad and they've got
[20:37.640 --> 20:42.920]  to pay taxes because they're black extra, it happens. Well in a republic you have set rules
[20:44.680 --> 20:50.440]  that you can't get around so the minority's protected as well as the majority. So the big
[20:50.440 --> 20:56.200]  popular state is protected just like the rural state. That's how the country got formed, it's
[20:56.200 --> 21:00.600]  how we came together, it's how we created checks and balances, but he got up there in the biggest
[21:00.600 --> 21:06.280]  lie I've seen out of his mouth. That's saying a lie. And repeated what Chuck E. Schumer said and what
[21:09.000 --> 21:15.400]  Nancy Pelosi said, and that's that this was the biggest attack since the Civil War. They also
[21:15.400 --> 21:20.440]  said since Pearl Harbor and since 9-11. All three of those things have been said, but he just now
[21:20.440 --> 21:25.880]  says, hey, it's bigger than 9-11. It's bigger than Pearl Harbor, it's bigger than World War II,
[21:25.880 --> 21:32.040]  it's bigger than Korea, Vietnam, World War I where 20-something million people died, close to a
[21:32.040 --> 21:42.680]  million Americans. 700 plus thousand died the Civil War. And they're saying that this is the
[21:42.680 --> 21:49.160]  biggest thing since the Civil War. Wow, what a lie. Four dead citizens and one dead cop from a stroke
[21:49.160 --> 21:55.880]  in what would be in normal riots after a basketball championship or hockey championship or soccer
[21:55.880 --> 22:01.080]  championship. We have blip on the radar screen, but it was the capitol that got overrun, so it's
[22:01.080 --> 22:05.400]  the end of the world and they show those big crowds outside as if that army was there to do it.
[22:05.400 --> 22:10.280]  Because they do fear that if we ever have to go and take a republic back, say for them, if they
[22:10.280 --> 22:14.920]  put Gigi Ping as the president, the media would tell you about him. I say he's not, if he's not
[22:14.920 --> 22:29.000]  elected. So let's go ahead, ladies and gentlemen, and talk about the reality here. And let's hear it
[22:29.000 --> 22:37.480]  from the zombie in chief's mouth, the undead, reanimated corpse, the skeleton, the mummy they've
[22:37.480 --> 22:49.080]  put rosy cheek makeup on. Here he is putting out the big lie that this was the biggest attack on
[22:49.080 --> 22:57.000]  America since the Civil War. And inherited a nation we all did that was in crisis. The worst
[22:57.000 --> 23:03.720]  pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on
[23:03.720 --> 23:11.560]  our democracy since the Civil War. No, you're the biggest attack on our republic, buddy boy,
[23:11.560 --> 23:18.120]  with your mob rule, globalist funded democracy. So it's all about redefining things right now.
[23:18.120 --> 23:27.720]  Now let's go ahead and let's go to the next clip. This is Joe Biden saying the biggest threat is
[23:27.720 --> 23:33.480]  white supremacy to that democracy. So he's saying white people are the number one threat to America.
[23:33.480 --> 23:39.160]  Here is the puppet attack on agent dividing and conquering. The threat is above way beyond
[23:39.160 --> 23:44.520]  Afghanistan. Those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee,
[23:44.520 --> 23:49.560]  defense committees, you know, well, we have to remain vigilant against the threats the United
[23:49.560 --> 23:56.840]  States wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in
[23:56.840 --> 24:03.480]  Africa, the Middle East and beyond. And we won't ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined
[24:03.480 --> 24:09.880]  to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today. White supremacy is terrorism.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.440]  We're not going to ignore that either. My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together
[24:17.320 --> 24:23.080]  to heal the soul of this nation. You know, I put out the headline today that he disguised his
[24:23.080 --> 24:28.040]  communism and globalism as democracy. And that's a true headline, but it's not strong enough.
[24:28.040 --> 24:36.120]  I'm going to go change it during the break. The puppet president declares what Saki's already
[24:36.120 --> 24:40.600]  said, and the Pentagon's already said, and the Secretary of Defense has said that supporting
[24:40.600 --> 24:45.720]  Trump, supporting America, existing supporting borders, supporting capitalism is white supremacism.
[24:45.720 --> 24:49.000]  I'm a white supremacist. Dr. Carlson's a white supremacist. They say it everywhere.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.680]  So he said, being a white supremacist is terrorism. So even if you were a white supremacist, that's
[24:54.680 --> 24:58.520]  not terrorism. There's plenty of black supremacist, Hispanic supremacists. You know, tribalism's
[24:58.520 --> 25:01.560]  out there. People have the right to do what they want. And in this climate, I expect to see more
[25:01.560 --> 25:06.840]  of it. I don't defend it. It's a way to divide and conquer it. But no, terrorism is actually
[25:06.840 --> 25:10.280]  murdering somebody, blowing something up like Antifa and BLM has been doing.
[25:12.920 --> 25:17.160]  A riot at the Capitol is not terrorism. But still, it's not good. It shouldn't have happened.
[25:17.160 --> 25:22.600]  But notice he says, white supremacism is terrorism. So anybody they define as a white
[25:22.600 --> 25:30.200]  supremacist on a no-fly list like Nick Fuentes, or you're picked up by the police and they say
[25:30.200 --> 25:34.280]  we want to use the CIA and the FBI. What did the ranking Republican intelligence committee say?
[25:35.320 --> 25:39.160]  Nunes, a few weeks ago, he said, they're preparing to use the intelligence community against
[25:39.160 --> 25:43.960]  Americans and Godowners. They are starting a civil war, the final end of the country.
[25:43.960 --> 25:48.760]  But you go, that'll destroy the country. That's the global plan. They're there to wreck the country,
[25:48.760 --> 25:54.760]  run us up on the rocks. They're wreckers. It's their plan. And here he is then using the UN
[25:54.760 --> 25:59.880]  slogan, build back better, which means world government rate reset. And he goes, that's not
[25:59.880 --> 26:05.640]  even enough. We need to do more than build back better. I mean, wow, here it is. We can't stop now.
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.680]  We're in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century. We're at a
[26:12.680 --> 26:18.200]  great inflection point in history. We have to do more than just build back better.
[26:18.200 --> 26:23.880]  To build back, we have to build back better. We have to compete more strenuously than we
[26:23.880 --> 26:28.040]  are. We're going to come back and pull the full clip. Ladies and gentlemen, the entire great reset
[26:28.040 --> 26:32.600]  is about shutting down Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Canada, the US, and any other former
[26:32.600 --> 26:37.800]  British Commonwealth countries to move everything to China and bankrupt us. Everything is a wet
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.280]  blanket. Everything is cut off the pipelines. Everything is shut off the factories. They
[26:42.280 --> 26:46.120]  were being totally shut off right now. They won't be gas for a third of the country this
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.920]  summer. They're announcing food prices will be 76% higher within six months. I've got it all
[26:50.920 --> 26:57.000]  coming up. We are under total globalist assault. America is under attack. I'm not going to sit
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.800]  here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full versus that. If you're
[27:03.800 --> 27:11.560]  paying attention, you know, we've done together. But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really
[27:11.560 --> 27:16.120]  up in their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[27:16.840 --> 27:22.120]  They're trying to shutter and silence a human resistance. So now is the time to understand
[27:22.120 --> 27:25.640]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate. Everything you warned your
[27:25.640 --> 27:30.120]  friends and family about is about to be true. So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[27:30.760 --> 27:36.440]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't. But it's up to all of us
[27:36.440 --> 27:43.800]  to not let them silence any of us. We have the power. But the sun is setting on humanity and
[27:43.800 --> 27:49.560]  setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long
[27:49.560 --> 27:52.680]  dark night doesn't come. So be the polar bears you are.
[27:56.920 --> 28:01.800]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses,
[28:01.800 --> 28:06.680]  the third world dies. We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving
[28:06.680 --> 28:12.760]  parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.480]  the third world and really hurt the first world. Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all
[28:17.480 --> 28:21.800]  over the United States. That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that
[28:21.800 --> 28:26.760]  could barely get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down. Plus the Keystone Pipeline
[28:26.760 --> 28:32.200]  has been shut down along with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.920]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.480]  to be a total slave. The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed until you
[28:41.480 --> 28:46.520]  wake up. This is a globalist chai-com takeover. Gregory said you have no hope. They're announcing
[28:46.520 --> 28:51.880]  that there will be less than two thirds of the gas needed this summer. So they told you that
[28:51.880 --> 28:57.560]  you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family. The scientific
[28:57.560 --> 29:03.000]  dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.360]  operational. The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover,
[29:08.360 --> 29:13.000]  their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.480]  have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it on.
[29:17.480 --> 29:21.960]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[29:21.960 --> 29:26.120]  we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[29:26.120 --> 29:30.920]  So prayer is essential. Research is essential. Getting prepared is essential and warning others
[29:30.920 --> 29:36.120]  is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting Info Wars by buying high-quality
[29:36.120 --> 29:40.120]  products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family
[29:40.120 --> 29:47.480]  and they're also funding our operation. InfoWarsStore.com. InfoWarsStore.com is incredible. A lot of

[29:57.160 --> 30:00.840]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[30:03.640 --> 30:08.520]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world of God.
[30:08.520 --> 30:13.640]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[30:14.200 --> 30:20.520]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[30:20.520 --> 30:25.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is in hand.
[30:25.720 --> 30:30.040]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to figure
[30:30.040 --> 30:33.880]  the world. It is the blueprint for the great reset. It is in-game blueprint for global
[30:33.880 --> 30:38.760]  enslavement available right now at InfoWarsStore.com with a zero country code meaning you can make
[30:38.760 --> 30:44.520]  copies of it anywhere in the world. I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at InfoWarsStore.com.
[30:44.520 --> 30:49.240]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it and if you take that action, I demand you tell
[30:49.240 --> 30:53.000]  others you've given a copy too that they make copies and share it as well. That will trigger
[30:53.000 --> 31:04.440]  distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[31:23.000 --> 31:32.360]  Oh, we're going over the mountain now, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:33.080 --> 31:38.040]  I think I've been over the mountain and then over some other mountains and over again and then back
[31:38.040 --> 31:46.600]  again. They're in back again. Let me just explain something to those first right now and then I'm
[31:46.600 --> 31:51.560]  going to hit this huge news. It's also huge. I've decided that all work and no play makes
[31:51.560 --> 31:56.760]  Jack a little boy so I actually took off Saturday and Sunday 90%. I still did some research. I
[31:56.760 --> 32:05.160]  couldn't help it but I spent 14 hours a day with my youngest daughter and my oldest daughter and
[32:05.160 --> 32:11.800]  my son came over and visited some too and so that was very refreshing and then last night
[32:11.800 --> 32:20.600]  I probably worked until about six or so and I made the decision yesterday. I said I'm so sick of
[32:20.600 --> 32:25.960]  Biden. I'm not going to watch this joint session thing, this abomination. I said I'll just read
[32:25.960 --> 32:32.440]  the transcript in the morning. So I watched Angry Birds with my daughter. Angry Birds too is pretty
[32:32.440 --> 32:40.520]  funny and that is more research and I went to bed at about 10 o'clock at night and then I got up at
[32:40.520 --> 32:48.520]  430 in the morning and I went to infowars.com and I went to Gateway Pundit and I went to CNN.
[32:48.520 --> 32:54.360]  I went to Fox News. I mean I went to Twitter. I've scanned over what he said and did and then now
[32:54.360 --> 32:58.920]  that I came in this morning and started watching the boil down clips that got me like 20 plus of
[32:58.920 --> 33:07.000]  them, almost no one is even getting what Biden really said. Almost no one is getting what Biden
[33:07.000 --> 33:16.120]  really said. He declared that they are officially going to use the intelligence agencies like
[33:16.120 --> 33:20.280]  we're in Afghanistan or Iraq on the American people and that they're bringing troops home
[33:20.920 --> 33:25.640]  for gun owners and conservatives. That's how they define white supremacists. So when you
[33:25.640 --> 33:31.880]  know the definitions and how they operate then he also said that you shouldn't have to have a job
[33:31.880 --> 33:36.440]  to get a paycheck so they're going to call universal income a paycheck. They're redefining
[33:36.440 --> 33:45.880]  everything right now and the clips go on and on and on and on and so he's a daughter in puppet
[33:45.880 --> 33:51.640]  but the people that wrote this they go America's back, freedom's back, we are democracies back
[33:51.640 --> 33:55.880]  when they're the ones overthrowing our republic in due process and engage in political purges. So
[33:55.880 --> 34:00.200]  it was I'm your friend America's here. We're America's we're here to help by getting rid of
[34:00.200 --> 34:03.880]  the borders and bankrupting your currency and tagging your guns and declaring white people
[34:03.880 --> 34:09.560]  are inherently bad. I mean the Bolsheviks funded by the big banks are making their move just like
[34:09.560 --> 34:20.280]  they did in Russia in 1917, 1918 and that's it and they've said that. I mean these people are
[34:21.400 --> 34:29.080]  absolute total monsters and their plan is to break the country and make us totally poor
[34:29.080 --> 34:35.080]  and controlled forever and there's so many cowards out there that know this is going on and keep
[34:35.080 --> 34:41.000]  them their head down well that's the reason we're going to lose everything. I mean this is just
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.840]  this is disastrous. Trump wasn't perfect but man I tell you you know why they're going after him
[34:46.840 --> 34:51.080]  they let him know that if he kept preparing to run for office he kept trying to control the
[34:51.080 --> 34:55.400]  republican party if he went out and did rallies around the country and if he said the election
[34:55.400 --> 35:00.520]  was a fraud which is his right to do the evidence overwhelming it was that they would start the
[35:00.520 --> 35:12.760]  indictment of Rudy Giuliani and then Trump Jr and then of course everybody else and it makes me
[35:12.760 --> 35:21.160]  admire Trump really more than ever. I know he's quote out of power so it's out of season to admire
[35:21.160 --> 35:27.080]  Trump and supporting but he's definitely the lion in winter and he's a symbol of the republic
[35:27.080 --> 35:32.760]  still strong still ready to fight but outnumbered overwhelmed and and just the lions alone surrounded
[35:32.760 --> 35:39.800]  by a bunch of cowards. I know the American people are ready to stand up I know you're upset but but
[35:39.800 --> 35:46.760]  when it comes to leadership DeSantis is good Jim Jordan is good Devin Nunes is good I mean you
[35:46.760 --> 35:52.840]  know Rand Paul is good Ted Cruz but but still they behave as if it's business as usual to a great
[35:52.840 --> 36:00.120]  extent we're under a world government takeover and so I hadn't seen that clip till they played I'd
[36:00.120 --> 36:04.520]  read the little transcript but only part of it brazil you know the white supremacism is the biggest
[36:04.520 --> 36:09.080]  threat in america and then when I heard what he said he goes just being a white supremacist
[36:09.080 --> 36:14.520]  terrorism well they define everyone is that they define me that is I mean it's I trend on twitter
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.480]  every week sometimes number one as a white supremacist it's like their religion white
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.960]  supremacist white supremacist white supremacist they just say it like abracadabra abracadabra
[36:23.960 --> 36:30.200]  open sesame and that's their legal excuse they believe to come set me up and throw me in irons
[36:30.200 --> 36:34.920]  and then the and then the fbi gets a little lollipop from chuckie schumer and the adl and you've got
[36:36.520 --> 36:42.440]  super creepy Sasha Cohen Sasha Barak Owen on tv saying I need to be arrested
[36:44.120 --> 36:47.720]  I mean they have adl meetings on tv where Alex Jones
[36:47.720 --> 36:52.760]  needs to be taken off the air when you do arrest people like him and mark zuckerberg and he doesn't
[36:52.760 --> 36:58.040]  let us run facebook and a month later they handed facebook over to the head of the adl

[37:04.680 --> 37:12.920]  ever seen the style on her hitler is uh the democratic party and there they are saying
[37:12.920 --> 37:18.600]  you're the bad man and we're gonna get you and I talked to other big national talk show hosts
[37:18.600 --> 37:23.400]  and they're all getting death threats and and being attacked and having their families attacked

[37:29.080 --> 37:34.600]  we became decadent we got mesmerized by television entertainment and by the time all the you know
[37:34.600 --> 37:38.840]  tough guy businessmen that just play golf all day and only care about themselves and think
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.320]  caring about the country you're stupid and it's a global system they're about to lose everything
[37:43.320 --> 37:48.680]  and their whole birthright and their wealth because the globalists are planning on bringing this
[37:48.680 --> 37:56.040]  country to its damn knees they want a mass purge they want death in the streets they want a big
[37:56.040 --> 38:04.280]  bloody civil war to hurdle the whole planet into a new dark age and people say why would they do
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.240]  this because it's the will of evil people they like to wreck countries they like to burn things
[38:09.240 --> 38:13.480]  down they like to murder people they like to stomp around in black uniforms and dominate
[38:14.200 --> 38:19.480]  and and when you're a methad devil worshipper college professor that you know by day spews

[38:23.880 --> 38:30.440]  you are worshipped by the FBI because they know that that is the foot soldiers for their takeover
[38:30.440 --> 38:35.160]  there's just dirty lawyers that want to carve the country up with the justice department
[38:36.200 --> 38:43.560]  we're weak soft people now we don't have value in ourselves our ancestors now and so we are
[38:43.560 --> 38:51.720]  in deep trouble now i said i'd get into the big shedding news the contagion news uh and there's
[38:51.720 --> 38:55.400]  a lot of it the special report i said this segment i'll do it next segment and then
[38:55.400 --> 39:02.040]  then when laura chin of the blaze a really smart lady um we will dissect biden's speech
[39:02.760 --> 39:09.320]  and we will break down what it really means uh but it's all there universal incomes being pro
[39:09.320 --> 39:13.640]  america you're a white supremacist you've got to renounce america or we'll call you a white
[39:13.640 --> 39:17.560]  supremacist and if we call you that no judge no jury you're on no fly list you can't have
[39:17.560 --> 39:22.520]  bank accounts you can't have jobs and we're gonna basically arrest you next first they demonize you
[39:22.520 --> 39:25.880]  take you off the internet then they take your banking then they make you homeless then they
[39:25.880 --> 39:31.720]  tell your family kick them out of the house or we're going to take your credit away and then
[39:31.720 --> 39:36.120]  you're thrown on the street then you're picked up and taken to a facility where they chain you up
[39:36.120 --> 39:41.640]  and a five or six potbellied anti-foot pedophiles come in and rape you before they kill you and
[39:41.640 --> 39:46.840]  their main mission is to get you and rape the folks i'm not kidding okay they all lust and dream
[39:46.840 --> 39:52.920]  they said i've had anything to tell me 20 years ago so we take over we're communists we're gonna
[39:52.920 --> 39:59.320]  rape and kill you and they're just soft weak people but they've got the Rothschilds and the
[39:59.320 --> 40:05.480]  Rockefellers behind them and they want a blood meal on you they know you're good they know you're

[40:15.240 --> 40:19.720]  coming and we've been preparing and warning people and i know in my heart we will defeat them
[40:20.280 --> 40:24.920]  but it's going to be horrible we're going to have nurenberg trials they're going to get trials
[40:25.720 --> 40:29.160]  we're not going to rape them and kill them in a dungeon we're going to give them trials and
[40:29.160 --> 40:33.480]  they're going to have to go to president those that lead this are going to have to be executed
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.680]  but that's that's not our job to do at this point they're going to launch their attacks it's coming
[40:39.880 --> 40:43.480]  just like the bolster revolution just like hitler just like the malice but now it's here
[40:43.480 --> 40:49.080]  it's here now judgment day is here you're going to feel the full rate of bill gates and the satan
[40:49.080 --> 40:51.640]  system all right we'll come back with a key intel stay with us
[40:55.960 --> 41:02.120]  i recently ran an ad where we played a cavalry bugle call in the background and i made the point
[41:02.120 --> 41:07.160]  today the cavalry is here but it's really true listeners are incredible and we're able to keep
[41:07.160 --> 41:12.200]  these great products in stock we were able to fund ourselves uh last year and actually dig
[41:12.200 --> 41:17.320]  ourselves someone out of a hole that we've been in because i expanded so much for the 2020 election
[41:17.960 --> 41:22.360]  but thanks to you we're still on air but now because of the shutdown in production and because
[41:22.360 --> 41:26.920]  of slowdowns with the whole covid lockdowns with supply chain a lot of our best selling products

[45:38.520 --> 45:46.120]  just for the state of the union that he's renamed the joint session just to exercise their power
[45:46.120 --> 45:50.840]  and they have house rules making house members wear masks even when they speak and they just
[45:50.840 --> 45:57.960]  follow the cult rules because fauci's god and who funds fauci bill gates again i'm alex jones
[45:57.960 --> 46:01.560]  your host thank you for joining us uh we talked about this last year we talked about it the
[46:01.560 --> 46:07.400]  medical literature we had scientists and medical doctors on we had virologists on we played many
[46:07.400 --> 46:11.720]  clips of other top virologists assigned the same the same thing that this mrna vaccine is not a
[46:11.720 --> 46:17.560]  vaccine the virus vector vaccine is not a classic vaccine either and it goes in and reprograms the
[46:17.560 --> 46:25.480]  cells to produce what the outside programming RNA tells it to do and that that causes shedding
[46:26.200 --> 46:31.880]  well shedding is a nice word for being contagious so overhead shot please we have this nice little
[46:31.880 --> 46:40.520]  folder here for you on shedding this is a small little portion for you and now it's big news
[46:40.520 --> 46:50.120]  because all over the world women who are 70 80 90 who haven't had a menstrual cycle in decades
[46:53.480 --> 47:00.680]  are now having their menstrual cycles again and women that are 20 30 40 are suddenly
[47:00.680 --> 47:04.840]  having them all the time or not having them and they're having miscarriages and it's being reported
[47:04.840 --> 47:11.880]  mainline scientist chicago tribune uh it it's it's happening in canada it's happening in germany
[47:11.880 --> 47:17.880]  it's happening in australia well i thought i'd play this new greg rich report that's a featured
[47:17.880 --> 47:24.920]  video at band dot video and i'd like to see this report get 10 million views our biggest uh
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.000]  report's gotten six million at band dot video i really want to break that record i'd like to see
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.120]  you go to band dot video right now and send this to everybody you know man woman and child and say
[47:34.120 --> 47:41.720]  check it out share it this is important this is lifesaving evidence is overwhelming that these
[47:41.720 --> 47:48.520]  mRNA vaccines are reprogramming the cells they admit to create super viruses that are now actually
[47:48.520 --> 47:54.040]  going to start killing people and they'll claim it's a new covid variant what a genius plan for
[47:54.040 --> 47:59.480]  their bio weapon because you see viruses always mutate become less lethal and then sometimes
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.640]  they mutate and become more lethal but then they again become less lethal but if you can put
[48:03.640 --> 48:09.160]  a virus that's already lethal but mutates a lot but but weak into a body it's gonna then
[48:09.160 --> 48:15.720]  program quote the same protein and put out the virus the rna at a much larger level and that's
[48:15.720 --> 48:20.600]  just one way it can do it and then you get a bunch of variants that will actually kill people that
[48:20.600 --> 48:26.200]  have never come in contact with anything like it so they turn you into a biological weapons machine
[48:27.160 --> 48:32.360]  what a genius plan by the globalist so before we play greg rich's report here's a few headlines
[48:32.360 --> 48:38.920]  this one is out of the new scientist a year and a half ago we now have the technology to develop
[48:38.920 --> 48:45.080]  vaccines that spread themselves and that's what they first did with the h1n1 flu vaccine they
[48:45.080 --> 48:51.080]  had quote a simulant the year before it was actually h1n1 that they spread it in they actually came
[48:51.080 --> 48:58.520]  out in the literature wow the boldness of that and then you have all these horrible medical problems
[48:58.520 --> 49:03.160]  oh you don't want to take it guess what you're going to take it it's live it programs the body
[49:04.200 --> 49:09.480]  here's even your precious mpr COVID-19 vaccines could add fuel to evolution of coronavirus
[49:09.480 --> 49:19.000]  mutations February 10th of this year here's the Pfizer report saying that it can jump into
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.200]  breastfeeding women and if you take the Moderna shot or the Pfizer shot or any of the mRNAs
[49:24.200 --> 49:29.480]  it can jump into a woman and stop her breastfeeding and even hurt the baby
[49:31.240 --> 49:43.320]  here it is right here pf 073020 for a vnd162 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines protocol c4591001
[49:44.360 --> 49:51.800]  and then you can read all about it for yourself by intallation of the skin from shedding from those
[49:51.800 --> 50:01.960]  that have had the mRNA vaccine and it goes on to say that it can spread to pregnant or breastfeeding
[50:01.960 --> 50:11.800]  women so let's continue scientific studies showing shedding of the vaccinator overhead shot please
[50:11.800 --> 50:21.720]  case of vaccine associated measles five weeks post immunization british columbia canada
[50:21.720 --> 50:28.120]  october 2013 major medical journal outbreak of measles among persons with prior evidence of
[50:28.120 --> 50:35.160]  immunity new york's another big study and then it goes on from their detection of measles with RNA
[50:35.160 --> 50:40.840]  and urine specimens for vaccinated recipients people are getting shingles they're getting
[50:40.840 --> 50:46.840]  herpes now from the mRNA vaccines comparison of the safety vaccines virus shedding and
[50:46.840 --> 50:51.720]  immuno efficiency of influenza vaccines and it goes on to talk about all those different types
[50:51.720 --> 50:57.960]  of vaccines giving it to you sibling transmission of vaccine derived rotavirus associated with
[50:57.960 --> 51:04.520]  rotavirus that goes on nature medicine engineering attenuated virus vaccines by controlling
[51:04.520 --> 51:11.880]  replication fidelity on and on and on okay so there's that because when people complain or
[51:11.880 --> 51:16.680]  women complain or you die or your father dies or mother dies or you get sterile they'll just
[51:16.680 --> 51:19.880]  laugh at you and say it's a conspiracy theory thinking you're too stupid to have the facts
[51:19.880 --> 51:25.240]  but you can share this quick report that we're about to air at man dot video and shove it down
[51:25.240 --> 51:31.240]  Bill Gates's throat so fight back we have the truth the people perish for lack of knowledge
[51:31.240 --> 51:37.880]  the report is at band dot video it is your mission to share it now and tell others to share it now
[51:37.880 --> 51:44.760]  fight back with information war vaccine shedding causing miscarriages and blood clots in unvaccinated
[51:44.760 --> 51:49.960]  females particularly on attack on our females again the globalist say they love blacks they're
[51:49.960 --> 51:54.440]  attacking the blacks they say they love women they're attacking the women anyone they say they love
[51:54.440 --> 52:04.120]  they want to kill here it is according to a recent Israeli study Pfizer's vaccine is 40
[52:04.120 --> 52:11.720]  times more deadly for old people than the actual COVID-19 virus and deaths began skyrocketing in
[52:11.720 --> 52:20.360]  Vietnam and Cambodia once the vaccine was administered to the public by all accounts the cure and
[52:20.360 --> 52:27.880]  experimental mRNA gene therapy is far deadlier than the so-called asymptomatic disease which
[52:27.880 --> 52:34.120]  amounts to the common cold despite the fact that the u.s federal government deliberately poisoned
[52:34.120 --> 52:40.920]  the alcohol supply during prohibition killing at least 10,000 people infected thousands of
[52:40.920 --> 52:47.720]  children with the polio vaccine in 1955 leaving hundreds with paralysis and killing almost a
[52:47.720 --> 52:54.280]  dozen infected millions of Americans with simian virus from contaminated polio vaccines
[52:55.320 --> 53:01.400]  and aggressively pushed highly addictive opioids on Americans while diligently securing the afghan
[53:01.400 --> 53:10.360]  poppy fields with our u.s troops despite a dreadful history of death injury and lies millions of people
[53:10.360 --> 53:16.920]  are somehow willing to line up for the latest experimental shot from big pharma but not only
[53:16.920 --> 53:22.920]  is the vaccine causing death and injury to the vaccinated the vaccinated seem to be shedding
[53:22.920 --> 53:30.280]  something terrible to the unvaccinated and big brother does not want you to know about it if
[53:30.280 --> 53:36.920]  you google search mRNA vaccine shedding all you will find are articles claiming that such a thing
[53:36.920 --> 53:43.800]  is a conspiracy theory as if we are all stupid but if you specify for anything published prior to
[53:43.800 --> 53:51.720]  say 2017 you will find a different story right at the top studies show that vaccinated individuals
[53:51.720 --> 53:57.560]  spread disease sources several scientific studies showing how vaccinated individuals
[53:57.560 --> 54:05.000]  can shed the virus for months and infect the unvaccinated and in their very own vaccine trials
[54:05.000 --> 54:11.000]  Pfizer was concerned about shedding in particular they were concerned about pregnant women being
[54:11.000 --> 54:19.000]  exposed to vaccinated test subjects by inhalation or skin contact after a young woman posted on
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.200]  instagram how her menstrual cycles were affected after coming into contact with a person who had
[54:24.200 --> 54:30.360]  recently been vaccinated she was inundated with hundreds of messages from other women who have
[54:30.360 --> 54:37.400]  experienced the same her account has been deleted several times by instagram for sharing these stores
[54:37.400 --> 54:45.000]  women who have bled for weeks after being in contact with the vaccinated women bleeding from
[54:45.000 --> 54:52.440]  their eyes women who have bled so badly they needed blood transfusions several women having
[54:52.440 --> 55:00.840]  miscarriages and girls as young as one year old bleeding from their vaginas these personal
[55:00.840 --> 55:08.840]  accounts are banned and censored from the public and now president joe biden is announcing that
[55:08.840 --> 55:16.360]  fully vaccinated people can go outdoors without a mask it seems that the worst is yet to come
[55:17.480 --> 55:22.680]  for info wars dot com this is greg rees they are now launching the bio attack by the way it was
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.920]  hundreds of times what they told you where they initially gave people bolio on purpose they told
[55:26.920 --> 55:30.920]  my grandmother that she was given it by accident but that's how she got it and was paralyzed
[55:32.280 --> 55:35.880]  but they've threatened to kill me for bringing this information but no matter we're all dead

[58:28.360 --> 58:32.920]  dr jane ruby joining us to get it out dangerous these vaccines are and what she's been seeing but
[58:32.920 --> 58:39.960]  lauren chen is coming up to go over biden's state of the union it was incredible of course we're
[58:39.960 --> 58:44.360]  not supposed to call us to the union it's a joint address because we're not a union it's all about
[58:44.360 --> 58:51.000]  divide in congress coming up let's put back on screen um the report that greg reese did just
[58:51.000 --> 58:55.400]  went live at bandot video uh that you know his video is now customarily about a million views
[58:55.400 --> 59:01.720]  this one needs a hundred million views because we said all this six eight months ago we we read to
[59:01.720 --> 59:07.800]  you from the top e you advisory boards wolf king ludarg the former had also uh mr yadan of
[59:07.800 --> 59:14.760]  fizer chief scientist that the literature shows that these things program the m r and a vaccine
[59:14.760 --> 59:25.000]  program the cells the mitochondria to basically create proteins that then the body that has an
[59:25.000 --> 59:31.080]  autoimmune response to them will attack the uterus will attack uh the ovaries but will also attack
[59:31.080 --> 59:35.720]  the brain will attack the testicles will attack a lot of areas but these proteins that are in
[59:35.720 --> 59:39.720]  this particular virus are very close to these other fast-growing proteins where you grow
[59:40.360 --> 59:45.240]  sperm uh where where women grow the lining each month inside their uterus so the zygote can
[59:45.240 --> 59:50.840]  implant and form uh with the placenta and that's what we said back in december when the scientists
[59:50.840 --> 59:55.960]  came out with their emergency injunction to the eu saying don't authorize these experimental vaccines
[59:55.960 --> 1:00:01.000]  because now they admit some of what's in them we believe it'll attack the uterus we believe and
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:06.120]  now what do you see all over the news even chicago tribune 85 nine-year-old women having
[1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:09.560]  menstrual cycles ladies and gentlemen well and the young women having them but continuous
[1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:14.920]  bleeding because it's scarring the uterus and it's in the news you can pull it up oh doctors say
[1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:21.240]  if your lymph nodes swell or your uterus swells and you get a ultrasound doctors don't do emergency
[1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:28.120]  surgery those tumors aren't bad those are just fibroids growing they're not malignant they're
[1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:32.360]  benign but when they cover the surface of the uterus you're never going to be able to get pregnant
[1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:37.320]  i'm not a woman but i've i've got four children and i know all about it and i worked as a large
[1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:41.800]  animal vet but i don't have degrees in it like the scientists but i can read what they write
[1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:47.480]  ladies and gentlemen and i know and so women particularly are flipping out i'd be flipping
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:53.560]  out as well so this is a targeting a depopulation operation gee a super villain that says he wants
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:59.160]  to depopulate you whose dad ran plant parenthood who says there's too many people has released a
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:06.280]  gene therapy that doesn't protect you from the common cold COVID-19 no it sterilizes you it
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:09.800]  reduces your fertility and the idiots will get more and more of the shots till you're fully
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:16.920]  sterilized you know my dad's got a lake and he's got a small lake and he wanted to get rid of the
[1:01:18.760 --> 1:01:22.120]  water vines that are growing in it because he wants to be able to swim in it so he went to
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:28.440]  the texas program they've got and they've got a type of a carp that you just put a little bit of a
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:36.280]  chemical in when they're babies and then it's it or when the adults are laying eggs and the
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:43.320]  fertilizing them and it causes them to be double chromosome so they're sterile so just one chemical
[1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:47.160]  that the state of texas puts in with carp does that my dad just went and got a hundred of them
[1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:53.400]  free and put them in his glorified pond but that's that's one chemical that they put in there
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:00.040]  what can you do with the biological that goes in and reprograms the body so that is
[1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:05.720]  all coming up and people are freaking out you say well bill gates won't get away with this well
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:10.040]  I've been saying that since we learned of this last year but see they're going to launch something
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:15.880]  bigger that will overshadow this and corporate media is going to gaslight hundreds and hundreds
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:19.800]  of women we know of including medical doctors that are talking about this in their practices
[1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:24.440]  that are seeing this are being banned off facebook twitter youtube i mean women who've been on their
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:28.680]  years have businesses they say hey i had a miscarriage or hey i'm bleeding everywhere this is
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:33.080]  our my mother's 80 years old she's having menstrual cycles again because she had a
[1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:36.200]  vaccine or she's around somebody that had it they're like nope you can't say that bloop
[1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:41.400]  that's the total control to see if they can hold us underwater and literally rape us with bill
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:46.440]  gates biological weapon so we're going to shift gears into the state of the union that was unbelievable
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:49.960]  that is all coming up that's why they're suppressing the doctors and scientists to keep
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:58.040]  from the truth of this genocide the scientific dictatorship that i've been warning you about
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:04.040]  for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational the globalists are out of the open
[1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:09.480]  with their planetary depopulation takeover their robot takeover but the good news is we've been
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:13.880]  working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:19.320]  ready for this to be able to find it off humanity is strong we're incredible and we're aware of the
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:23.880]  attack that's happening we have a real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance we will
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:28.600]  defeat it so prayer is essential research is essential getting prepared is essential and
[1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:34.200]  warning others is absolutely essential and at the same time supporting info wars by buying high

[1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:37.560]  speech with uh biden so i want to go over that with her first thank you so much for joining
[1:05:37.560 --> 1:05:41.880]  us lauren great to have you here i like thank you so much for having me it's great to be back
[1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:45.160]  what do you want to tackle first as we asked you what do you want to talk about you said
[1:05:45.160 --> 1:05:51.320]  this speech was incredible there's so much in this what strikes you as the most interesting
[1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:56.200]  well i think the overall impression that i got is that when it comes to the government
[1:05:56.200 --> 1:06:02.120]  joe biden and his administration think it's it's their job to just take care of the american people
[1:06:02.120 --> 1:06:07.080]  as some sort of mother hen figure if you look at everything he said regarding their jobs plan
[1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:12.760]  well he wants government funded jobs if he wants free college for everybody of course we know free
[1:06:12.760 --> 1:06:19.000]  means taxpayer funded he wants to expand things like medicare and medicaid keeping people on
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:24.120]  government programs and it's just the polar opposite of the vision of for america that people
[1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:28.280]  like president trump were putting forward where people were able to provide for themselves and be
[1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:33.400]  successful on their own merits fast forward to joe biden's america and now it seems like everybody
[1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:39.480]  is just going to be a protectorate of the state it's scary stuff i totally agree that the big
[1:06:39.480 --> 1:06:45.880]  takeaway is advertising communism but with a bunch of steven miller written lines from
[1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:49.720]  trump's past state of the unions i mean because a lot of these were word for word what trump would
[1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:55.480]  say but then he would add to it universal income statements or race war statements he would he would
[1:06:55.480 --> 1:07:00.280]  act like i'm from america i'm here to help we're back everything's great after the left just tried
[1:07:00.280 --> 1:07:04.760]  to shut the country down for the last year now they're blaming that on trump and claiming a chicken
[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:11.080]  every pot no definitely and i was frustrated to see that joe biden after only a hundred days in
[1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:15.320]  office is trying to take credit for a lot of the previous administration successes we're talking
[1:07:15.320 --> 1:07:19.960]  about the vaccine which liberal media when trump said we're going to get it done and get it distributed
[1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:24.120]  they said that it was impossible now that it's happening they want to take credit for it and
[1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:29.720]  we also see that after trump had these amazing economic successes we're talking record low
[1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:36.600]  unemployment rates for black people women hispanic people wages were rising then covet comes along
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:41.960]  all of these democrat governors shut their states down causes a recession of course and you know
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:46.040]  once once joe biden got elected president though it seems like a lot of people on the left started
[1:07:46.040 --> 1:07:51.800]  to ease up on covet and now joe biden is trying to take success for or trying to take credit for
[1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:58.200]  the fact that the economy is once again recovering after yeah they removed all of these regulations
[1:07:58.200 --> 1:08:03.080]  and restrictions it's like that's not you creating jobs or helping the economy that's
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:08.840]  simply you being less oppressive to the american people uh what was also frustrating is that he
[1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:14.360]  claimed the fact that uh companies like amazon have done better over the past year is the result
[1:08:14.360 --> 1:08:20.760]  of trickle down economics uh capitalist in any sense of the word i don't think so this is purely
[1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:25.720]  the result of these big government uh sanctions that have nothing to do with what capitalism
[1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:30.760]  and free markets are actually i totally agree lauren and for me it sounded like he's fully embraced
[1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:36.520]  bernie sanders a lot of this was bernie sanders platform but just dressed up with an american
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:42.280]  flag oh definitely and you you saw that he tried to i think appeal to the moderates by saying oh i
[1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:46.840]  have disagreements with other democrats i think you should be able to be a millionaire and a billionaire
[1:08:46.840 --> 1:08:51.800]  well guess what he said that in reference to the fact that he's going to raise taxes make america
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:57.880]  less competitive and we also saw him throw in a couple jabs at china president shijing ping
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:03.800]  i think he's trying to overcorrect for the whole beijing biden scandal that we've seen unfolding
[1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:09.000]  with his son as well hunter biden oh i totally agree after he went on two weeks into office and
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.920]  said we should let china invade hong kong basically let him take him to taiwan let him
[1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:18.520]  keep wiggers and death camps and and and buddhas and christians that really hurt him in the world's
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:23.560]  eyes so i agree totally overcorrected in fact i bet ggp and we know basically controls him
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:27.720]  probably said hey it's a little obvious you can get a couple you know blows in so they don't know
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:33.240]  you're an agent you and swallow as well no for sure and what what strikes me is that if trump had
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:38.600]  said just a fraction of what biden ended up saying last night in his attempt to overcorrect
[1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:42.760]  the media would be all over him at accusing him of being racist xenophobic and essentially
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:48.120]  trying to start another war but because it's biden i guess we're just gonna remain quiet we also
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:53.320]  saw him stealing some of uh trump's america first or by american rhetoric in regard to yeah we're
[1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:57.000]  going to buy american these are going to be american jobs brah brah brah brah brah brah
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.200]  when trump tried that same line he was called uh racist and divisive but but trump also got
[1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:07.400]  energy prices way down basically cut in half so that's why we could have factories again it's
[1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:11.000]  why we could have jobs again because we've got to have cheap energy or we can't compete with anybody
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:17.240]  you're right and that's a key difference between how trump was trying to approach job creation versus
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:21.960]  biden trump wanted to get the business environment friendly enough where entrepreneurs small business
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:26.920]  owners could employ people and could make people's lives better from the ground up meanwhile you
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:32.360]  turn to biden his plan for american job creation really is just let the government hire all these
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:37.000]  people well who do you think is going to be paying the salaries of these jobs i hope the american
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:40.280]  people are smart enough to realize that it essentially just means they're going to have to be
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:45.240]  paying through their tax dollars to employ their neighbors and that's not real growth that's not
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:52.040]  real job creation that's just i mean on its way to a social estate lauren chen we've got a few minutes
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:55.480]  three four minutes to break but but i want to get into a lot of topics with you but let me just
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:11:02.440]  raise some of these firsts we'll come back and play these clips he had this big whopper where he
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:07.320]  says that the attack on the capital was the biggest most destructive thing in america
[1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:12.200]  since the civil war i mean that is just the preposterous joke level that he did a careful
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:16.680]  definition that the southern property law center and others do that white supremacism if you're white
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:21.160]  supremacist or terrorist but then they label everybody as a terrorist so now i guess tucker
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:25.320]  carlson myself were all terrorists and they're going to use the cia and army on us i mean where
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:31.640]  is the aclu this is just outrageous declarations and then cnn's like democracies back the police
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:37.400]  states over when it was trump trying to dial back the police state and then he uses a un thing about
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:42.600]  build back better that means the great reset it goes on and this was crazy if you know what the
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:48.520]  dog whistles are to the globalist and the communist oh definitely i think this entire speech essentially
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:53.480]  was one huge dog whistle to the globalist and when you look at uh what was the thing that you
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:58.120]  mentioned the whole build back better thing i mean we've seen time and time again people overseas
[1:11:58.120 --> 1:12:04.440]  in the un in the uk using the same phrase and same slogan and it really is i think terrifying
[1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:08.760]  and i think when you look at joe biden and his entire administration really they're they're trying
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:15.160]  to present a moderate face on what are essentially aoc and bernie sanders full on socialist policies
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:21.000]  it's it's socialism with a mask of capitalism but that doesn't make it any better you're absolutely
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.960]  right let's go ahead and play the clip of him saying the un slogan here it is
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:36.360]  we can't stop now we're in competition with china and other countries to win the 21st century
[1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:42.840]  we're at a great inflection point in history we have to do more than just build back better
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:48.840]  to build back have to build back better we have to compete more strenuously than we have
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:57.000]  throughout our history you think about it public investment in infrastructure has literally
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.920]  transformed what she's not doing what only six percent goes to roads that's the first usually
[1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:05.880]  infrastructure is 90 percent roads and ports and things it's all communism and sex changes and
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:10.680]  the rest of it and the big thing is build back better means agenda 21 is in 2030 officially
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:16.520]  great reset meaning the west cuts its power and china and india and mexico don't lauren chin
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:23.000]  no and i think if you're actually familiar with things like actual climate science which
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.760]  he's trying to present this as the guys that are oh we need to fight against climate change
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:30.520]  therefore we're going to invest in all of this green energy it's really just a way to make
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:36.200]  america less competitive while like you said india china the biggest global competitors
[1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:41.480]  do nothing of the sort and i don't know if you also caught but later on in the speech he referenced
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:46.760]  the fact that oh china thinks that democracy is not viable because autocracy gets things done so
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:53.400]  much faster that sounds almost like a compliment to me i thought the same thing let's play that clip
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:14:01.080]  when we come back we'll be right back folks stay with us i recently ran an ad where we
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:06.360]  played a cavalry bugle call the background and i made the point that hey the cavalry is here

[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:14.840]  and we were just talking about joe biden and we were talking about the bazaar event last night
[1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:20.840]  he called a joint address let's address that pun intended why do you think he called it a joint
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:25.640]  address when throughout history we've had state of the union's first written reports of people
[1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:29.480]  like towards washington later presidents would come and you know once we had a bigger capital
[1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:33.000]  and actually address them why do you think they're not calling it a state of the union but a joint
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:38.120]  address i was confused about that too when i mean really if you look at exactly what the
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:42.840]  content of the speech was the timing and everything it is a state of the union i think they were
[1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:48.840]  perhaps trying to downplay the significance of this i i every time that i see biden get
[1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:55.160]  up on stage and give a speech i am waiting for some sort of awful flub or just mistake in general
[1:16:55.160 --> 1:17:00.520]  he was surprisingly coherent last night though but i do think that the administration was not trying
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:05.720]  to hype this up they've kept biden relatively under wraps so i i think they knew they couldn't
[1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:11.320]  avoid getting him in front of congress at some point so i think maybe their play was to try to
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:16.520]  make it seem less significant to get fewer viewers and i think it was definitely successful
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:20.360]  overall you know the number of people that watch this which should have been a big deal
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:24.680]  paled in comparison to even just the number of people who are live streaming for example
[1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:31.720]  president trump's recent speech at cpaq earlier this year so i i mean i guess it's it's just
[1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:37.000]  trying to say hey look i'll swear uh definitely don't pay attention to our president who might
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:41.640]  well go off on what was that name of that the leg hair guy i don't know he says a lot of stuff
[1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:49.000]  i want to go to the thing we talked about earlier because it's just so amazing here is president
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:54.440]  joe biden referring to january 6 capital riot as the worst attack on american democracy when we're
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:58.360]  republic we'll talk about this week the republic the democracy with you in a moment here's what
[1:17:58.360 --> 1:18:06.360]  he said last night and inherited a nation we all did that was in crisis the worst pandemic in a
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:13.560]  century the worst economic crisis since the great depression the worst attack on our democracy
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:22.920]  since the civil war so world war two hitler the cold war millions of dead tens of millions
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:29.320]  around the world world war one uh korea vietnam uh this is the biggest thing since the civil war
[1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:34.600]  lauren well yeah and that's especially strange to hear from him considering they're still trying
[1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:39.400]  to peddle the idea that trump was first selected in 2016 due to russian interference they haven't
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:44.920]  given up on that yet if that is true wouldn't that have been even a bigger deal by their own
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:50.040]  standards it's just very hypocritical and i'm sure you've noticed in the amount of times that they
[1:18:50.040 --> 1:18:54.360]  are trying to invoke democracy lately which is really just mob rule as the founding fathers
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:19:00.360]  understood um they they are more than willing at this point to throw people's individual rights
[1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:04.840]  under the bus in the name of whatever the majority wants and we actually saw that
[1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:10.600]  in this speech itself when joe biden tried to argue that uh was it amendments to the constitution
[1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:18.840]  are not absolute i was shocked i don't know how you felt about that now you're absolutely right
[1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:24.040]  what do you think we as the people should do about that well i think the first thing is that you
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:28.680]  need to get people like joe biden out of office because there are some politicians out there we
[1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:33.720]  see ronda santis who are standing up for individual liberties standing up for people's rights to bear
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:39.000]  arms and also for free speech but if you have people like joe biden in office and highest office
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:44.120]  in the land federal government which is increasing its reach and scope every single day yeah they're
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:48.760]  saying that right now the second amendment is not absolute but how long until they're saying that the
[1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:55.000]  first amendment is not absolute either we're already seeing a big tech as you know better than anybody
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:00.760]  creeping uh with its censorship how long until a federal government you know spearheaded by people
[1:20:00.760 --> 1:20:05.720]  like aoc who's already trying to say facebook is not doing enough to censor white supremacists
[1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:09.800]  how long until it's the federal government that's censoring people not just big tech that's what
[1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:15.960]  i'm concerned about unless people act now and be active in in politics then there's going to be a
[1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:21.000]  time where it's too late to fight back i agree with you i want to talk about this now and when we
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:24.680]  come back from break this is going to take some time for me it's all about definitions and we've
[1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:31.240]  seen sake come out about 90 days ago when when when he just gotten into office or stole his land
[1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:36.920]  office and he had her say and then he said and the secretary defense said our main mission is
[1:20:36.920 --> 1:20:40.920]  white supremacist and the fbi said the main mission is white supremacist are the biggest threat not
[1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:46.840]  al-qaeda not isis not china not anything now last night in this address he says we'll play the clip
[1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:52.280]  next segment that they are the main threats white supremacist and that white supremacist are terrorists
[1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:55.640]  now i don't like white supremacist or black supremacist or spanish supremacist or any of those
[1:20:55.640 --> 1:20:59.800]  groups but the idea that they just called you that well even if it was a white supremacist
[1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:03.560]  that's their right as long as they don't hurt anybody but to say if we say you're a white
[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:09.160]  supremacist you're now a terrorist and the fbi has said we're going to disrupt the uh
[1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:13.560]  tea party we're going to disrupt the trump movement we're going to disrupt the election fraud movement
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:17.320]  we're going to disrupt the populist movement i mean this is really a declaration of war against
[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:24.600]  populace by labeling us terrorist by calling us white supremacist i mean he's really doing it
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:32.040]  in a so-called joint session uh joint address no you're right and what i think people are so
[1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:36.040]  quick to forget now because they don't want to be called white supremacist themselves is that
[1:21:36.040 --> 1:21:40.680]  i don't like white supremacist at all i'm no fan of any racial supremacy movement and you know we
[1:21:40.680 --> 1:21:47.480]  agree on that but it should still not be illegal to be racist to be a jerk to be you know just a
[1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:52.200]  bad person that shouldn't be worthy of getting you thrown into jail or on an fbi watch list
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:57.160]  and then you add to the fact that we are living in a time where even president donald sump himself
[1:21:57.160 --> 1:22:02.120]  for our president he's called white supremacist people like ted cruz are called white supremacists
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:06.520]  they have shifted the oars and windows so far left that literally if you're anyone who is voted
[1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:11.960]  republican at any point in your life you're liable to be called a white supremacist and that's why
[1:22:11.960 --> 1:22:17.560]  if it looks nonsensical when they call tucker carlson a white supremacist leader or when they
[1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:22.520]  call donald trump that or myself or anybody that's that's a nationalist or a patriot because they
[1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:27.160]  intend to outlaw us they intend to hunt us down they intend to put us in prison all of this by
[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:32.200]  extension they've said they want to arrest anybody that was even at the capital not in the capital
[1:22:32.200 --> 1:22:36.600]  that they're visiting people comes but even go to the capital who were down the road at the main
[1:22:36.600 --> 1:22:42.360]  event with trumpete ellipse right and i mean what we're seeing you mentioned nick fuentes earlier
[1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:48.040]  we are seeing the gradual actually not so gradual escalation of attempts to deep person people
[1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:53.000]  who they disagree with and that's not acceptable and i'm ashamed to see how many conservatives
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.800]  have said oh well you know they were kind of asking for weren't they no no they were not and if
[1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:03.560]  those mainstream gops with their uh i guess jelly spines think that they're going to be exempt from
[1:23:03.560 --> 1:23:09.640]  the less crusade against uh wrong things and they're wrong all right we're going to go to break
[1:23:09.640 --> 1:23:13.560]  we've got a longer segment coming up i want to go through these clips and i've got like 15 of them
[1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:16.920]  i hope we have time to go through them all but there was one other clip you were mentioning
[1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:21.560]  before the break i meant to get to and then i forgot what the clip was you were talking about
[1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:26.280]  uh what was the clip that you were asking me to play because we've got it in the list uh was it
[1:23:26.280 --> 1:23:33.000]  maybe the uh no amendment is absolute or or no the autocracy that was it saying you know china
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:37.800]  thinks they're better because they're basically a dictatorship or an autocratic autocracy but
[1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:42.360]  we'll show them democracy works when all they've been doing is mimicking china just like jester

[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:46.760]  mass murder in history here he is a few years ago praising dictatorship and then we'll play
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:56.200]  joe biden's clip last night the level of of admiration i actually have for china um because
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:29:02.840]  their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:07.640]  and say we need to go green as fast as we need to start you know investing in solar i'll be there
[1:29:07.640 --> 1:29:12.280]  as a flexibility that i know steven harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could
[1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:17.960]  do everything he wanted uh okay so now here's biden last night saying hey you're autocrats which
[1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:24.280]  means an autocracy a a dictatorship like a technocracy autocracy is predate what you call
[1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:29.480]  a technocracy uh so bureaucrats running your life he says oh but you know we're going to
[1:29:29.480 --> 1:29:33.880]  defeat you with our democracy where all they're trying to do is divide and conquer our country
[1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:43.720]  here it is tonight i come to talk about crisis and opportunity about rebuilding the nation revitalizing
[1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:53.880]  our democracy and winning the future for america i stand here tonight one day shy of the 100th day
[1:29:53.880 --> 1:29:59.880]  of my administration 100 days since i took the oath of office and lifted my hand off
[1:29:59.880 --> 1:30:06.360]  so there you go that's exactly what you were just talking about um what do you think's
[1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:10.360]  going to be happening to biden he's obviously seen how he can barely talk
[1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:17.400]  how do you see this train wreck unfolding well i think what's been interesting watching the first
[1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:22.680]  couple months of his administration is that when it was president trump everyone was focused on
[1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:27.160]  president trump himself what he was saying what he was posting etc etc with the biden
[1:30:27.160 --> 1:30:33.320]  administration we talk way more about uh jen sake or kamala harris than we actually do
[1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:38.040]  biden himself but i think that's because all of us kind of understand there's this implicit agreement
[1:30:38.040 --> 1:30:44.040]  that yeah biden himself is not the one who is calling the shots here he is like you said a puppet
[1:30:44.040 --> 1:30:48.840]  i think after i don't think he's gonna last two terms i mean i i hopefully would like to see a
[1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:53.480]  republican office the next time around but even if that doesn't happen it's not going to be biden
[1:30:53.480 --> 1:30:59.080]  there's just no way they can continue to uh weekend at bernie's uh you know his his humility
[1:30:59.080 --> 1:31:04.520]  through another four years after that but what when what's really frustrating is that democrats
[1:31:04.520 --> 1:31:09.800]  we have seen since president trump has been in office that they are willing to do whatever it takes
[1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:14.600]  to get more power which we see them talking about abolishing the electrical electoral college
[1:31:15.160 --> 1:31:20.040]  nancy polosius talked about lowering the voting age until 16 now they're trying to pack the supreme
[1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:25.320]  court um they will do whatever it takes to get more control and so it's no surprise to hear them
[1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:30.520]  talk so favorably about autocracy because they can i mean wax poetic about democracy all they want
[1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:34.920]  but i think at the end of the day we all know that if there was a way for them to have absolute power
[1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:40.680]  and be able to push whatever agenda that they want through they would take it i talked about this
[1:31:40.680 --> 1:31:46.760]  clip earlier but here's biden talking about white supremacy being the number one threat
[1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:51.880]  and saying that the cia and the pentagon say so so i'm supposed to have the cia and the pentagon
[1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:56.600]  talking about the american people that's authoritarianism that's all the red flags but
[1:31:56.600 --> 1:32:01.720]  plus the numbers have come out it's totally not even true until you define america first
[1:32:01.720 --> 1:32:07.800]  controlling our borders capitalism all of that as white supremacy which they call everything white
[1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:12.920]  supremacy now that you know they call science white supremacy they call mathematics white
[1:32:12.920 --> 1:32:18.360]  supremacy they call spelling too i mean speak of that before i play this clip because he's really
[1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:23.320]  defining people that have american values as white supremacist and then saying that means you're
[1:32:23.320 --> 1:32:29.480]  a terrorist it's it's it's just he's declared war on america no he essentially has i mean for half
[1:32:29.480 --> 1:32:34.920]  of the people out there i would say even more than they actually the left in general biden
[1:32:34.920 --> 1:32:39.640]  specifically they think that your views are important and they think that you are potentially
[1:32:39.640 --> 1:32:44.840]  dangerous because of the values that over i mean hundreds of years have just been considered
[1:32:44.840 --> 1:32:50.840]  traditional american values and conservatism um they've tried to paint uh this whole narrative
[1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:55.720]  that people who are at the capital and even not the ones who are you know actually storming into
[1:32:55.720 --> 1:33:00.760]  the building but just your everyday protesters that they are dangerous which is completely insane
[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:05.960]  considering the fact that again we've had last year a summer of love we've seen blm riots protesters
[1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:12.600]  and antifa uh do untold damage not just property damage but also inflicting violent harm on other
[1:33:12.600 --> 1:33:17.880]  people they're saying nothing about that while trying to paint people like nick fuentes as the
[1:33:17.880 --> 1:33:23.640]  devil really they expect the american people to buy that i hope they don't i want to go through more
[1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:30.200]  of these clips but what about liz cheney we'll show the clip in a moment but liz cheney running
[1:33:30.200 --> 1:33:37.240]  down the aisle almost tripping herself that's not social distancing to to shake the mummy's
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:41.880]  hand and this is who the republicans are trying to claim is the new leader who's now running the
[1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:47.480]  republican leadership conferences and it's who running strategy conferences and trump's not in
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:34:00.280]  trump's not invited just absolutely insane here's the club
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:07.480]  oh my god this makes me just just want to vomit this is all so sick
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:12.120]  what do you make of the system trying to push the incredibly unpopular
[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:19.960]  uh tentacle of dick cheney warmonger uh on the american people well we saw president trump
[1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:25.960]  declare war on the swamp and as we all should have expected the swamp declared war on him right
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:31.720]  back so we see people like liz cheney uh people like mit romney as well like when he was still in
[1:34:31.720 --> 1:34:38.200]  office to absolutely turn on any principles they claim to have because of a personal vendetta
[1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:42.760]  against president trump i mean we look at the lincoln project that whole entire group of
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:48.680]  losers and sexual harassment enablers it's really just gross and i think if we look at the republican
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:53.320]  party right now there is a very clear divide between people who actually are america first
[1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:59.560]  patriots and nationalists versus the establishment swamp gop who for i mean decades now has been
[1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:03.960]  more than happy just going along with the status quo and not really doing anything to actually
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:09.800]  advance conservatism and what frustrates me to no end are people like liz cheney who have
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:16.520]  done absolutely nothing to accomplish supposedly republican goals talking down to people like
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:21.080]  president trump to people who are supportive of the america first movement because what they
[1:35:21.080 --> 1:35:25.240]  don't like their rhetoric well at least they're effective at least they're getting things done
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:30.120]  unlike uh you know the cheneys and the bushes of the world who've actually i think done more than
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:36.200]  anyone else to harm the conservative movement that's right let's play a little clip of uh biden
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:40.120]  basically making fun of american gun owners when it's one of the fundamental
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:45.080]  rights of this country it's how the war started that led to our independence in 1776 was the
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:50.440]  uncomplicated election in concord there's no possible justification for having a hundred rounds
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:51.960]  in a weapon
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:36:01.160]  what do you think dear learn kevlar's best well then why do you need it to wage why do you need
[1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:05.640]  bodyguards and fences and barricades and armored vehicles because you're an elected tyrant and we
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:12.840]  have our guns protect ourselves from you let's play another clip your take on that lauren well i
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:18.040]  think conservatives republicans anyone who cares about the second amendment needs to stop buying
[1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:23.160]  into the left-wing talking point that guns are just for hunting no that is not what the second
[1:36:23.160 --> 1:36:28.440]  amendment talks about nowhere on it does it say we need guns in order to go shoot dears that's not
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:33.560]  what it's for it is explicitly to protect against a tyrannical government so i mean frankly if in
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:39.240]  response to that i i want republicans people who care about gun rights to say no it's not for dears
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:44.360]  it's to keep people like you who seem to be power hungry in track and it's just to ensure that people
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:49.640]  have the ability to defend themselves from any threats both foreign and domestic that's right
[1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:54.600]  lauren kin is amazing final segment with her i watch her all the time i'm getting into my trouble
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:37:01.640]  for me saying that i'm up here working on a thursday night in mid april 2021 and i just want to say

[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:38.840]  look as negative as all of this gets humanity goes through cycles over and over again and we're
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:43.560]  going through a cycle of decadence and corruption the difference is in the middle ages or in other
[1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:48.280]  times establishments would get corrupt things would just fall apart and then people will just go back
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:53.240]  to live in the woods for a while then redevelop your civilization society again now we've got
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:57.640]  nuclear weapons now we've got particle beams now we've got biological weapons and now we've
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:04.680]  got propaganda and we've got the psych psychological systems being hired by big tech and by corporations
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:10.600]  to get away with dumbing down the public so they're more easily controlled but then that only adds the
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:18.200]  overall instability in the end so i see this whole situation hurtling towards a real crisis in the

[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:15.640]  still run the republican party which is great they began raiding juliani the word is they're
[1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:21.720]  going to try to raid uh donald trump jr next that makes me admire trump more that they told him if
[1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:25.160]  you don't go away we're going to come after you criminally and he's not going away that makes
[1:43:25.160 --> 1:43:31.160]  me admire trump even more i feel the same way and if i if i look at essentially the hole that has
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:36.600]  been left in the republican party without his strong leadership i i do think it leaves the door
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:41.320]  open for people like the chinese and the romneys to take in and really subvert the america first
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:45.800]  movement and uh you know a lot of the progress that donald trump has made in trying to shift
[1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:51.160]  the national discourse to something that actually resembles conservatism talking about things that
[1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:55.800]  people really care about like immigration um like like doing things trying to bring back
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:44:02.040]  manufacturing jobs that's what i i care about my only concern with a potential 2024 run is that
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:08.360]  donald trump despite a house fry he is you know he he is getting uh up there in years and of course
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:12.840]  you also have people like ronda santis who i really want to say in florida because i'm
[1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:18.280]  i'm moving there with my family and i want him to save for us but he would i think would be a great
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:23.960]  contender if donald trump feels that uh you know he he can't continue uh to lead the republican party
[1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:29.000]  to kind of maybe take over and we've already seen reports of them to having meetings and i i hope
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.560]  that they're getting along and actually in an ideal world i would love to see a trump de santis
[1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:39.640]  ticket in 2024 what do you think of that i love to see it just really a good guy very level very
[1:44:39.640 --> 1:44:44.360]  serious and and he just cuts through their bs here's a few more of the bizarre clubs
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:57.400]  from last night's uh i forget what biden calls it a joint address instead of state of the union
[1:44:57.400 --> 1:45:07.560]  with regard to russia i know a concern some of you but i made very clear to prudin
[1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:17.560]  that we're not going to seek escalation excuse me escalation i mean you talk about choking this
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:22.440]  is a disaster i mean i i don't like the democrats i hate the globals but it's even embarrassing for
[1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:27.480]  me because he's not the president he clearly stole the election but he's there he represents us and
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:33.880]  he is an embarrassment oh absolutely and it's funny because when trump was president the media
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:39.240]  would focus and zero in on any little thing he said any little typo on twitter meanwhile it seems
[1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:44.040]  like joe biden has trouble getting his actual words out and they're just quiet about it although i
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:49.240]  did say uh a podcast i hosted to my friend nomo larky that they must have given him the good
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:55.560]  atter all last night because despite the the uh the few flubs he had he was still better prepared
[1:45:55.560 --> 1:46:01.640]  and more uh more polished than i think i've seen him in quite a bit but regarding russia i mean
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:06.520]  he can say that he's not seeking escalation but he absolutely his administration absolutely is
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:11.640]  escalating things with russia he recently put out an executive order that essentially is trying to
[1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:17.400]  you know prevent russian uh people who are not even the russian government but any any organization
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:21.560]  that is linked to the russian government from doing things like conducting business in the united
[1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:26.600]  states and uh i mean we know that russia is a convenient bogeyman for the biden administration
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:31.720]  because they can appear tough on uh foreign relations without seeming racist but i do worry
[1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:37.880]  about the uh the escalation that we are seeing here's another weird line from last night's speech
[1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:50.600]  the most radical line tonight was when joe biden said we the people is the government
[1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:58.120]  no joe you seriously misunderstand the constitution we the people is not the government we are not a
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:04.280]  country of dictators in washington running the people we the people is the people damn it who
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:09.000]  were in charge of the government whose freedom you're taking away whose liberty you're stripping
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:17.400]  away and it showed the arrogance of the hard left that they think that it last time so why
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:25.000]  he is the state is what he said and he's we the people i mean holy cow that was radical and and
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:30.840]  that's where where today's democrats are in closing lauren chand what else are you mainly
[1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:36.680]  focused on right now that's that's a and then b the exodus out of the blue states and blue cities
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:41.720]  the the collapsing ratings for all the woke sports for all the entertainment shows
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:46.440]  but the grammy's the emmy's the oscars a 25 percent of what it was just a few years ago for the
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:52.440]  oscars i mean they're in free fall trying to tell us that we're in free fall but really populism
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:57.080]  and americanism and the love of liberty seems to be exploding all around the world so what's
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:02.200]  front and center for you what else are you watching on your radar and then just your take on this
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:07.800]  paradox of they claim it's over for us the populist when we're super popular they're having to suppress
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:13.160]  us because people want freedom uh they're obviously the tyrants and then biden's up there talking
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:19.640]  about how trump was basically a dictator this is preposterous no it is and increasingly what i am
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:25.720]  focused on i'm sad to say this one of the only peaceful way for ways forward that i can see is
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:32.040]  as michael malice calls it a national divorce i i honestly do believe in compromise i'm a firm
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:36.520]  conservative but i'm i'm willing to work with people of different political opinions but if we
[1:48:36.520 --> 1:48:42.440]  look at the leftist and globalist right now they are not willing to let other people live their
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:46.920]  lives however they want you can say that oh that's fine they can do whatever i'll just be over here
[1:48:46.920 --> 1:48:52.200]  in texas or florida or any other red state but the sad truth is that these people will not leave
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:56.760]  you alone you can try to retreat from the cities which i still encourage people to do but at the
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:49:01.880]  end of the day they are still going to try to control every aspect of your life uh including
[1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:07.320]  what your children learn in schools what you're able to call each other i don't know how we can
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:13.160]  continue to live side by side with people who are so keen on oppressing us and taking away
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:19.400]  every single individual liberty that we have and i maybe this is too cynical of me but more and more
[1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:25.000]  i i want to look at okay how how can the people who do believe in liberty and freedom how can we
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:30.200]  sort of shore up our numbers somewhere like texas or florida just to ensure that at least there are
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:36.280]  some strongholds and bastions of freedom left in the country because more and more i'm just worried
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:40.600]  the way things are going we're being conquered it's a it's a it's a takeover because these
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:45.400]  these globalists feel inadequate they literally want to mount america's head on the wall they want
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:50.600]  that big victory the power the money the glory when they can just find jesus christ and have it all
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:54.040]  right there lauren shin i really appreciate you joining us and i appreciate all the great points

[1:53:09.080 --> 1:53:15.320]  had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted
[1:53:15.320 --> 1:53:22.360]  to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse
[1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:30.040]  nine then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all
[1:53:30.040 --> 1:53:36.520]  nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:41.400]  hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the
[1:53:41.400 --> 1:53:46.280]  founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created

[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:45.400]  predicted all of this what it means to have biden say anybody that's basically pro america pro trump
[1:54:45.400 --> 1:54:49.560]  is a white supremacist and we're going to use the pentagon and we're going to use the military on
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:57.480]  you i mean this is this is incredibly illegal and it's incredibly dangerous and so all of that
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:55:03.080]  is coming up uh in the fourth hour today ahead of the vaunted out of the park the show's always
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:07.480]  been good man am i glad we got oh and shroy are working here five years ago in the last three years
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:11.080]  hosting his own show he has just been knocking out of the park with the war room so is harris
[1:55:11.080 --> 1:55:17.080]  smith weekday mornings uh with american journal we've got some excerpts of that coming up as well
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:22.360]  in the fourth hour uh but let's go to this very important report that's at bandot video from greg
[1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:33.240]  reese on well here it is according to a recent israeli study phyzer's vaccine is 40 times more
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:40.680]  deadly for old people than the actual covet 19 virus and deaths began skyrocketing in vietnam
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:48.760]  and cambodia once the vaccine was administered to the public by all accounts the cure and
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:56.280]  experimental mrna gene therapy is far deadlier than the so-called asymptomatic disease which
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:56:02.520]  amounts to the common cold despite the fact that the u.s federal government deliberately poisoned
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:09.880]  the alcohol supply during prohibition killing at least 10 000 people infected thousands of children
[1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:16.440]  with the polio vaccine in 1955 leaving hundreds with paralysis and killing almost a dozen
[1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:24.600]  infected millions of americans with simian virus from contaminated polio vaccines and aggressively
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:30.680]  pushed highly addictive opioids on americans while diligently securing the afghan poppy fields
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:38.760]  with our u.s troops despite a dreadful history of death injury and lies millions of people
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:45.320]  are somehow willing to line up for the latest experimental shot from big pharma but not only
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:51.320]  is the vaccine causing death and injury to the vaccinated the vaccinated seem to be shedding
[1:56:51.320 --> 1:56:58.680]  something terrible to the unvaccinated and big brother does not want you to know about it if
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:05.320]  you google search mrna vaccine shedding all you will find are articles claiming that such a thing
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:12.040]  is a conspiracy theory as if we are all stupid but if you specify for anything published prior
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:19.560]  to say 2017 you will find a different story right at the top studies show that vaccinated
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:25.000]  individuals spread disease sources several scientific studies showing how vaccinated
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:31.960]  individuals can shed the virus for months and infect the unvaccinated and in their very own
[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:38.760]  vaccine trials phaser was concerned about shedding in particular they were concerned about pregnant
[1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:46.840]  women being exposed to vaccinated test subjects by inhalation or skin contact after a young woman
[1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:52.360]  posted on instagram how her menstrual cycles were affected after coming into contact with a person
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:58.600]  who had recently been vaccinated she was inundated with hundreds of messages from other women who
[1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:05.240]  have experienced the same her account has been deleted several times by instagram for sharing
[1:58:05.240 --> 1:58:11.320]  these stories women who have bled for weeks after being in contact with the vaccinated
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:18.520]  women bleeding from their eyes women who have bled so badly they needed blood transfusions
[1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:28.600]  several women having miscarriages and girls as young as one year old bleeding from their vaginas
[1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:36.120]  these personal accounts are banned and censored from the public and now president joe biden is
[1:58:36.120 --> 1:58:44.040]  announcing that fully vaccinated people can go outdoors without a mask it seems that the worst
[1:58:44.040 --> 1:58:52.280]  is yet to come for info wars dot com this is greg rees we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen
[1:58:55.480 --> 1:59:00.440]  the scientific dictatorship that i've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[1:59:00.440 --> 1:59:06.520]  for beta testing to operational the globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation
[1:59:06.520 --> 1:59:11.400]  takeover their robot takeover but the good news is we've been working and you've been working
[1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:15.640]  and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to
[1:59:15.640 --> 1:59:20.920]  find it on humanity is strong we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:25.720]  we have a real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance we will defeat it so prayer is
[1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:30.680]  essential research is essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely

[2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:26.760]  a nurse or just a mother or father or a virologist or a chemist or an engineer or a school teacher
[2:00:26.760 --> 2:00:32.680]  or a farmer or a lawyer that if we're not agreeing with the un and dr falchi and whatever
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:38.280]  bulgates says we're not allowed to have speech online if we take a vaccine and get paralyzed
[2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:42.840]  they're going to censor the local newscast if women get vaccinated and have convulsions or
[2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:49.480]  suddenly start bleeding or growing tumors in the uterus they get censored is a giant exercise
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:54.840]  in suppression and we know it's an unapproved vaccine we know it's experimental we know it's
[2:00:54.840 --> 2:01:00.120]  secret the top scientists that had a first look at it warned us prestigious scientists and said
[2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:05.960]  it's going to attack women's uteruses and now that's pouring out in the news media look at these

[2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:47.720]  going on in dc the climate therein what you talk about the new media in the war to censor us how
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:52.920]  you see this unfolding so doc thanks for joining us it's great to have you here thank you alex my
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:58.680]  pleasure what do you want to start first i just threw out a lot of things there sure uh why did
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:06.360]  we start with my recent uh ban from facebook where i actually uh was was accused of violating their
[2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:11.400]  their policies and their standards of which they don't even explain what those are but it was because
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:18.440]  i posted a very important connection uh people have to understand that the reason these healthy
[2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:24.840]  viable treatments we have like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin these are these are tried and true
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:30.360]  many years of safety and they have efficacy they're approved by the fda finally figured out why they've
[2:04:30.360 --> 2:04:37.240]  been banned and bashed alex and that's because uh what what people don't know is because if they
[2:04:37.240 --> 2:04:43.560]  didn't bash them they wouldn't be able to create this uh emergency use authorization that everyone
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:50.840]  is talking about and if you look at the fda site themselves they explain that the ability to uh
[2:04:50.840 --> 2:04:59.240]  authorize on an emergency basis a medical device or a drug is actually stipulated by statute they're
[2:04:59.240 --> 2:05:05.240]  violating their own laws and let me just quote for you they say that one of the requirements
[2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:12.600]  uh to get an emergency youth authorization is that quote there are no adequate approved and
[2:05:12.600 --> 2:05:19.880]  available alternatives i was banned from facebook because they told me that was a lie it's not a
[2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:25.400]  lie uh everyone knows from frontline doctors dr samon golden countless thousands of other
[2:05:25.400 --> 2:05:31.160]  doctors across the united states who are being honest and true to their hypocritical of causing
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:37.560]  no harm that we do have safe reliable treatments and and beyond that alex we're talking about a
[2:05:37.560 --> 2:05:44.520]  flu with an almost 100 recovery rate with no treatment it's absolutely insane and so that's
[2:05:44.520 --> 2:05:50.440]  why i was banned yesterday for 24 hours i've never been banned before in 10 years on facebook i'm
[2:05:50.440 --> 2:05:57.320]  surprised i haven't but but that was the reason i saw your interview on red voice media you were
[2:05:57.320 --> 2:06:02.920]  uh breaking it down so well uh they're scared of how you articulate this plus it's an admitted
[2:06:02.920 --> 2:06:08.280]  fact that if they admit ivermectin or they admit hydroxychloroquine or even zinc out of a d3c is
[2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:14.360]  on record even on the nih website i showed this last year and again earlier this year it may still
[2:06:14.360 --> 2:06:20.360]  be up there probably is about zinc and about d3 it said on the nih website that try to check it out
[2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:26.120]  guys i just that it's essential to the mitochondria and if you don't have it viral infections can kill
[2:06:26.120 --> 2:06:31.800]  you so they admit it's basically a natural treatment but they don't want any hope and as you said it
[2:06:31.800 --> 2:06:38.680]  triggers the emergency law that there's no other approved treatment or provable treatment then we
[2:06:38.680 --> 2:06:42.760]  can do experiments on you with gene therapy which they couldn't get approved for 10 years that's
[2:06:42.760 --> 2:06:48.200]  really what this is all about that's absolutely right and i'll tell you you know it's been shoved
[2:06:48.200 --> 2:06:54.360]  down our throats now for months that um oh over 500 000 americans have died you have to take this
[2:06:54.360 --> 2:07:00.440]  pandemic seriously well first of all by definition we don't have a pandemic anymore and secondly the
[2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:07.880]  outrageous part of this whole thing is that 500 000 americans did not have to die if they had
[2:07:07.880 --> 2:07:14.120]  access to hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin i don't know if you're aware of this but last march 2020
[2:07:14.120 --> 2:07:19.400]  i actually came down with covid i had a positive test i did have flu like symptoms for several
[2:07:19.400 --> 2:07:25.320]  weeks i was told by a very respected primary physician in arlington virginia that i would
[2:07:25.320 --> 2:07:32.680]  have to just tough it out and he was talking to me as a fellow medical uh professional and i
[2:07:32.680 --> 2:07:37.400]  queried him on it and said what do you mean why don't you give me the hdq you know i'm positive
[2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:42.440]  and he said we don't do that unless uh people are in the icu and he was very nervous about it
[2:07:42.440 --> 2:07:47.560]  and i said well why would you wait till i i was that serious and that's sick to give me those
[2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:54.120]  medications i went on to study and do some research i found that all of the democrat governors
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:08:00.600]  were blocking access to hydroxychloroquine by using their their state departments of health
[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:06.680]  they hold medical and nursing and pharmacy licensure in their hands and they were essentially
[2:08:06.680 --> 2:08:13.320]  threatening that if these doctors nurses and pharmacists dispensed or prescribed the this
[2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:19.640]  safe cure for for for covid they would essentially lose their license and other would be what you're
[2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:23.480]  saying is so massive this is all admitted this is what you're being banned on facebook for
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:28.120]  that you have governors like quomo playing doctor ordering sick patients into nursing homes where
[2:08:28.120 --> 2:08:31.960]  you got most of the death then trying to cover it up and then all over the country democrats
[2:08:31.960 --> 2:08:37.160]  playing doctors saying you may not give hydroxychloroquine you may not give ivermectin which you just
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:42.600]  said was a death sentence so they use their licensure to come in and keep doctors from doing what
[2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:48.040]  was already approved already on the shelf literally killing people to keep big pharma hysteria going
[2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:54.440]  so they can ram through their mrna getting pig testing on us absolutely right and the sad thing
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:09:04.520]  about this alex is that physicians know nurses know we all know that it's a lie on the cdc website
[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:10.520]  you can all go look at it yourselves it claims it uses the term safe and effective for these
[2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:16.280]  these experimental injections and you can only claim that something is effective and safe if
[2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:21.480]  you have completed human trials or what we call clinical trials to the very end and as you well
[2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:28.360]  know these trials for all four of these injections are not going to be completed until 2023 uh and
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:34.440]  so and there's another issue uh which we can talk about in a little bit uh of informed consent
[2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:39.560]  there's a huge scandal around the lack of and i want to talk to your list the doc say there you
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:44.280]  are hitting all the key points but anybody i've heard just laying out reminding me how this is so
[2:09:44.280 --> 2:09:49.320]  criminal how it's all a hoax claiming that that that that that that it's safe and effective it's
[2:09:49.320 --> 2:09:59.720]  just a giant criminal operation stay with us cnn has almost no viewers the adl is reviled and hated
[2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:04.520]  across the united states in the world as a pack of anti-free speech liars but that doesn't mean
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:08.920]  that they don't have power just like the southern property law center that's just as bad they represent
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:13.880]  the globalist the big power structure that wants authoritarianism and backs common as china and its
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:18.920]  death camps and they back bringing those similar systems here to america and they've even officially
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:25.000]  called the adl for my arrest for my speech and for mark zuckerberg to be arrested for free speech as
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:30.120]  well these are very very dangerous times they don't want us to be on air you funding our operation

[2:10:54.520 --> 2:10:58.920]  again i don't like to lecture people i'm a very private person but because of the globalist
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:03.800]  their attack on humanity i've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and we've
[2:11:03.800 --> 2:11:09.160]  given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of god and i know some of our listeners
[2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:12.920]  get mad when i talk about god all day but just give me a break the satanism's out in the open
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:17.960]  i've always been a christian but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:21.960]  and i get it a lot of you've been turned off by big churches a lot of you've been turned off by the
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:28.440]  corrupt priest class system and i get it me too believe me i'm one of them but it's that relationship
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:35.800]  with god and just god's universe that god created that is so essential and and god created the universe
[2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:39.880]  for us to have communion with god through and to have life and so that's what info wars is

[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:44.360]  right author bill meger it's true we all know it's true but she's reminding us of the last 14
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:48.120]  months what we've gone through and what's currently happening and they just hope we forget about all
[2:12:48.120 --> 2:12:56.280]  the crimes bill gates the big five pharma going out quietly buying off all the major health
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:02.200]  services of the world except for russia and a few others teaming up with china to fair monger
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:08.120]  coming with big tech censoring everybody telling the truth having governors and other leaders around
[2:13:08.120 --> 2:13:15.640]  the world block known treatments that were having 99 success rates to jack up death numbers sending
[2:13:15.640 --> 2:13:21.240]  infected people into nursing homes knowing that would cause mass death to jack up numbers putting
[2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:25.080]  people on ventilators instead of giving them treatments that they knew were helping medical
[2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:30.600]  doctors in texas that run major facilities say oh we give them uh in inhalable steroids 100
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:37.880]  recovery in hours to not immune response no can't do that either uh just diabolical organized
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:43.400]  corporate evil and that's big pharma and the un taking over the planet and then bringing in their
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:48.920]  systems who died and made bill gates god now he wants to block the sun out i mean i used to tell
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:52.360]  people 10 years ago that he was behind the geoengineering i had the documents people
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:57.000]  could believe it now he's on tv going i'm spraying stuff out of the jet engines it's added the fuel
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:03.160]  here's the patent and i'm gonna make the aid i mean that it's now all there they are taking over
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:08.600]  they're playing god they treat us like children and pat us on the head and say oh you know don't
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:14.440]  ask questions it's safe and effective no one's been hurt meanwhile it's all a lie so and and
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:18.920]  they're not giving people real consent or they're not telling them the law that they're lying to
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:25.240]  everybody it's all coercion so get more into that into that more dr jane ruby and in the
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:28.920]  shorter segment longer segment i want you to then drill into how you think we strike back
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:32.600]  against this and how we how we counter but you were getting into some other areas of their
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:39.400]  fraud as we hit the break sure happy to do it alex i wanted to talk a little bit about the
[2:14:39.400 --> 2:14:44.120]  issue of informed consent because many people are throwing that term around i've been in
[2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:49.160]  pharmaceutical drug development for almost 20 years i've actually written informed consents
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:54.840]  they're usually very lengthy documents and here's the key about them in order to get your study
[2:14:54.840 --> 2:15:01.240]  approved to be able to implement it uh on to human beings you have to have what's called an irb
[2:15:01.240 --> 2:15:07.800]  institutional review board stamp on that form that form has certain minimum requirements
[2:15:07.800 --> 2:15:13.720]  you have to disclose every possible risk associated that you're aware of any benefits that might come
[2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:19.640]  out of it and if you lie later your names on the line you're gonna go to prison absolutely and these
[2:15:19.640 --> 2:15:25.080]  irbs are federally registered so when they put that stamp on it they're they're actually putting
[2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:30.200]  their names and reputations on here's the point of the story i have been offering at like in the
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:34.600]  spirit of andrew break bar when he was offering thousands of dollars for that proof of tape
[2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:41.880]  i've been offering i'm up to five thousand dollars for anybody to show me a bona fide irb stamped
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:48.920]  informed consent for any of these four experimental injections nobody can prove i've gone to that's
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:52.920]  right they're not telling people this is experimental and you opt into this even if they give an
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:57.160]  emergency authorization you've got to give the consent that you know it's experimental like
[2:15:57.160 --> 2:16:01.480]  when you go in for experimental gene therapy experimental surgery you've got to sign off on it
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:09.720]  absolutely since the nuremberg trials and the code of the 10 codes that came out after that
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:15.320]  to protect human subjects from the very thing we are being subjected to every day with these four
[2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:21.560]  injections it's just unbelievable please continue because i interrupted you explain this this is
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:27.720]  nuremberg code tenebra convention since 1946 this is international law u.s law and they're just
[2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:36.360]  bulldozing it they're bulldozing it they're there no one can show me an irb stamped informed consent
[2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:42.680]  now irbs fit in either universities or there are some private ones like western or sterling
[2:16:43.240 --> 2:16:48.440]  i've written many of them i've submitted them to institutional boards for their approval they
[2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:52.520]  often come back they want more information they want to know how we're going to protect
[2:16:52.520 --> 2:16:58.520]  potentially pregnant women children things like that what this is just steamrolling ahead
[2:16:58.520 --> 2:17:04.280]  they're now talking about giving this these experimental injections to children this this
[2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:12.440]  is blowing my mind and nobody can produce for me uh an irb stamped informed consent when people are
[2:17:12.440 --> 2:17:17.560]  going to say grocery stores or drug stores or wherever they're going community centers
[2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:22.920]  they're getting from what i can tell so far at what's called a checklist and there are a couple of
[2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:28.920]  negative you know things that might say well you might get a rash you might have some flu symptoms
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:35.320]  they're not telling people about things like shedding they're not telling people about why
[2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:43.880]  people are having bleeding like like really paradoxic situations blood clots at the same
[2:17:43.880 --> 2:17:49.320]  time that they're bleeding out in other parts of their body very difficult things for for physicians
[2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:55.160]  and icu's to manage because it's just it's just a red you know alarm going off in the body and
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:17:59.640]  that's what's happening for a lot of people getting these injections i don't call them vaccines alex
[2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:04.280]  because by definition they're not they don't confer immunity they that's right their master
[2:18:04.280 --> 2:18:10.760]  rating is just a classic vaccine what i mean they're a gene therapy aren't they they get in i'll
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:16.360]  give you the sort of the the the visual they get into every cell in your body they hijack some of
[2:18:16.360 --> 2:18:22.360]  the dna material they also damage your mitochondria which if everybody remembers from high school
[2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:26.600]  those are your powerhouses that's what gives you energy that's why weeks and months later a lot of
[2:18:26.600 --> 2:18:32.760]  people after these injections never recover from severe fatigue but they hijack your dna and they
[2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:39.240]  replicate the spike protein the problem alex is that a lot of the protein materials the building
[2:18:39.240 --> 2:18:45.640]  blocks in that replicated spike protein is recognized in other parts of your body they're
[2:18:45.640 --> 2:18:50.840]  they're part of what you have creates a placenta now you can make the connection to a miscarriage
[2:18:50.840 --> 2:18:57.560]  and many other similar amino acid chains in your body there is a disaster coming alex on a freight
[2:18:57.560 --> 2:19:04.600]  train and you see all these uh sheriff's deputies and people that think they're out helping with
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:08.760]  the classical vaccine that can still have its own problems but this is totally different they don't
[2:19:08.760 --> 2:19:13.480]  know they're in all involved in a mass crime how do you think bill gates thinks he's going to get
[2:19:13.480 --> 2:19:18.200]  away with this i mean these globalists because obviously this is a depopulation soft kill um
[2:19:18.200 --> 2:19:21.800]  sterilization operation just like garters who got connected to the same thing with women's
[2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:25.560]  infertility i mean how are they going to get away with this because i mean people are really waking
[2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:32.040]  up well primarily they're getting away with that through obfuscation just just you know gas
[2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:38.600]  lighting and and and blurring everything and you know encouraging people to to question themselves
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:46.440]  and buying off probably lots of physicians and cdc officials and who officials to create confusion
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:51.400]  so that people think well maybe it's not so bad maybe it's not as dangerous as you know dr
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:56.360]  jane or alex or his guests say or yeah but but that's that's that's the way they're getting away
[2:19:56.360 --> 2:20:00.600]  with it and by the time well then why are they buy exactly why are they violating the law then
[2:20:00.600 --> 2:20:05.560]  why are they lying to people and why have hundreds of influencers on facebook twitter and other
[2:20:05.560 --> 2:20:09.720]  places gone public and so they were offered up to ten thousand dollars a piece five thousand
[2:20:09.720 --> 2:20:13.800]  three thousand dollars to say they had the vaccine and it was great even if they didn't
[2:20:13.800 --> 2:20:22.920]  money talks and i'm ashamed to say it but we we now have the collision of medicine and politics
[2:20:22.920 --> 2:20:28.200]  we've never had this before and you've been over that target for many months now well you're
[2:20:28.760 --> 2:20:33.160]  dr jane ruby i listen i saw you uh on some of the shows you've done i've seen your show we're
[2:20:33.160 --> 2:20:36.040]  just so glad you're there please stay there i'm gonna try to come back and just give you the
[2:20:36.040 --> 2:20:40.360]  floor to talk about where we go with this and more warnings because i don't have people like you on
[2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:44.280]  team humanity we're going to win folks call everybody you know tell them tune in now later
[2:20:44.280 --> 2:20:48.920]  once this is archived at bandot video share it this is life-saving information stay with us

[2:21:04.840 --> 2:21:12.360]  tell you this the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all
[2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:17.160]  independent forms of media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so
[2:21:17.720 --> 2:21:22.520]  now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been pretty inaccurate
[2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:26.680]  everything you warned your friends and family about it's about to be true so it's now that your
[2:21:26.680 --> 2:21:33.240]  credibility is way up the power structure should have silenced those of us that they can't but it's
[2:21:33.240 --> 2:21:41.000]  up to all of us to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:47.240]  and setting on free speech we have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long

[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:29.320]  and the viewers ensemble cast on the internet and a lot of tv stations and cable stations as well
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:38.600]  now if you sit back and you look at all this if if bill gates and the eugenesis the depopulationist
[2:25:38.600 --> 2:25:42.360]  that have even been in the wall street journal 15 years ago saying we meet in secret and talk
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:47.320]  about world government and depopulation just type in billionaires meet the secret talk about
[2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:51.960]  overpopulation and they say we're setting up world government to carry out depopulation bill gates
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:57.720]  says that publicly but if they try to get the military or corporations to fly around with
[2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:03.160]  drones or whatever and just spray you that would be openly illegal and they would go to president
[2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:06.760]  people in their own organization will blow the whistle on them but if they package something
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:11.800]  is one thing when it's really another bring it out roll it out during hysteria get people to sign
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:18.920]  on to it get governments to sign on to it get media to sign on to it get parents to sign on
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:24.920]  to it get pastors to sign on to it now they're going to have stock on syndrome when the illnesses
[2:26:24.920 --> 2:26:30.360]  and the miscarriages and the deaths and the tumors start and they're going to make excuses for it
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:35.640]  and in all the videos oh look this woman got paralyzed neck down she goes i still would do it
[2:26:35.640 --> 2:26:41.960]  again it's great for everyone we just need more funding to make vaccines safer and that's how the
[2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:48.040]  psychology works and so now it's like human sacrifice every culture every ancient culture at
[2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:52.760]  one time or another had human sacrifice usually right before the society collapses and people would
[2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:58.760]  bring their children mothers would and throw them into a fire or let their hearts be cut out or let
[2:26:58.760 --> 2:27:03.640]  them you know have their heads chopped off because a lot of times the high priest would demand a child
[2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:09.880]  that was to prove their fealty to the controlling psychologist of the day the mind controllers
[2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:15.640]  the cult so you can get people to kill their own children and that's basically where this is already
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:23.560]  going so dr jane ruby's very impressive lady dr jane ruby dot com author filmmaker talk show host
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:27.800]  find all our information at dr jane ruby dot com and she's written a book i look for a reading
[2:27:27.800 --> 2:27:32.040]  about how the wave is unstoppable as long as all the great people like you and her and others
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:36.760]  just start speaking out doesn't matter how well spoken or how badly spoke it doesn't matter just
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:42.120]  tell the truth document is going to change the world they cannot stop the signal so i just kind
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:46.200]  of stated how this operation works can you elaborate on that and then all the other great
[2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:50.920]  points you want to make because i mean you've really been nailing it for people to understand
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:57.000]  how premeditated this is i'd love to hear your view on how we counter it sure alex let me spend
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:02.280]  a moment just talking a little bit about safety and what that really means i don't think people are
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:08.360]  aware or i don't think they're taking seriously the point i made earlier about the fact that these
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:14.360]  trials are still ongoing why is that important first of all in sars one when they attempted to
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:20.120]  develop a vaccine they did preclinical studies which is petri dishes and animals and in the animal
[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:27.800]  sections all the animals die across species that's a huge safety signal that would halt any development
[2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:33.480]  program that i've ever been aware of in my career let's just elaborate on that normally if you have
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:38.440]  a hundred monkeys and two die they probably wouldn't approve the drug or the vaccine you're talking about
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:43.480]  in ferret studies and others a hundred percent die in mRNA vaccines and then that's why they
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:48.520]  skipped animal testing this time this is insane sorry i'm interrupting no not at all you've hit
[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:54.040]  you hit that one on the head the thing is that these animal models uh they they don't live as
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:28:59.720]  long as obviously they have shorter lifespans so you get to see the damage earlier but so so in
[2:28:59.720 --> 2:29:06.200]  these trials these four companies that we're dealing with right now shockingly they were allowed to
[2:29:06.200 --> 2:29:14.040]  bypass uh phase phase uh i'm sorry uh animal trials preclinical phases that's unheard of
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:21.160]  secondly uh the the reason they're rushing the the distribution of these injections is because
[2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:26.440]  my feeling is they can't afford to wait till the trial is over because they will have so many
[2:29:26.440 --> 2:29:32.840]  signals safety signals uh of side effects uh deaths uh accumulated that they could never
[2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:39.080]  justify and the fda would have egg on their face would never be able to justify a full-on fda
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:43.320]  approval so it's very important for people to understand you're tripping over yourselves
[2:29:43.320 --> 2:29:49.480]  to get this these injections and the trials haven't even finished yet you are the trial
[2:29:49.480 --> 2:29:54.600]  very very dangerous i i think it's important for people to know that and i suspect alex alexa
[2:29:54.600 --> 2:30:01.320]  that's why people are not getting true bonafide informed consents because if they had to
[2:30:02.040 --> 2:30:07.080]  stamp put their stamp of approval on an informed consent they would require all of that disclosure
[2:30:07.080 --> 2:30:14.120]  and nobody in their right mind would take it if they took the time to read the informed consent
[2:30:14.120 --> 2:30:17.320]  you're absolutely right i'm just sitting here watching you on my big tv over here when they cut to me
[2:30:17.320 --> 2:30:23.080]  because you're so dead on why do you think the globalist went with something this bold i don't
[2:30:23.080 --> 2:30:27.160]  see how they get away with this i mean everything that top sign is like wolf king woodhog and others
[2:30:27.160 --> 2:30:31.960]  warned about eight nine months ago has now come true dr sherry tenpenny is warned of this
[2:30:31.960 --> 2:30:40.200]  warned of the shedding and now it's happening i mean this is crazy dr tenpenny has done an
[2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:48.280]  amazing job in explaining what this injection what this material actually does in your body
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:55.400]  she has explained a little more elaborately than i i did earlier of what this is this is forcing
[2:30:55.400 --> 2:31:04.600]  your body to make a replicate repeat the spike protein that you see on the outside of this whatever
[2:31:04.600 --> 2:31:10.920]  this viral material is that they're injecting into you and and like i said earlier it's hijacking your
[2:31:10.920 --> 2:31:18.600]  own dna this means you you are undergoing a permanent transformation of your genetic material
[2:31:18.600 --> 2:31:24.200]  you will pass that on to your children and grandchildren this is irreversible you can't
[2:31:24.200 --> 2:31:29.800]  get it out of your body you know we used to talk about traditional vaccines are do have some toxic
[2:31:29.800 --> 2:31:34.360]  properties to them some of them have done in the past but you could always you know
[2:31:34.360 --> 2:31:40.200]  keelate them off you could you could do things to detoxify yourself there is no way to reverse
[2:31:41.080 --> 2:31:47.800]  this material in your body and so my hashtag over and over again alex has been just wait
[2:31:47.800 --> 2:31:54.680]  you have nothing to lose by waiting don't jump in the fray and and that's right they are stampeding
[2:31:54.680 --> 2:32:01.080]  people into this like they're selling time shares in in hell uh cnn wrote a very deceptive article
[2:32:01.080 --> 2:32:06.040]  the other day they said 60 of people have been vaccinated or planned to be in the us but it was
[2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:13.160]  only like 15 to 20 really they were just saying or 60 may get vaccinated it looks like though record
[2:32:13.160 --> 2:32:17.880]  levels of people are refusing this suddenly all these big vaccine centers are empty and having
[2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:24.760]  to shut down what are the numbers you've got uh i've i've actually been getting um i i i opened
[2:32:24.760 --> 2:32:31.160]  up a proton male dr jane ruby a proton to have people safely report some things that are happening
[2:32:31.160 --> 2:32:36.520]  and the intimidation they're experiencing for example the biggest thing that's happening is people
[2:32:36.520 --> 2:32:43.320]  are being forced in their employment yet to get the vaccine to either stay at work come back to work
[2:32:43.880 --> 2:32:49.640]  come back to work in person and i think this is a very very dangerous slippery slope i'm not sure
[2:32:49.640 --> 2:32:56.120]  how it'll play out in the courts uh i i i just want people to wait i also want them to heed
[2:32:56.120 --> 2:33:02.120]  you know a lot of the warnings that you've given them push back ask more research more find out
[2:33:02.120 --> 2:33:07.000]  don't trust dr jane ruby go look at these things they're all out there in the public domain if you
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:13.800]  can dig through the cdc and who and fauci lies and smokescreen you will get so there's a lot of
[2:33:13.800 --> 2:33:18.440]  truthful material out there oh my goodness everything fauci says changes constantly and the
[2:33:18.440 --> 2:33:23.320]  guys the complete liar who's heavily invested in the vaccines and basically ran the wuhan lab
[2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:29.960]  absolutely uh you know that that level for biosafety lab i have no idea what it's doing
[2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:35.560]  uh in the middle of a country that wants to take the rest of the world out uh that that's a serious
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:40.280]  problem i know you've addressed that many many times it really concerns me a fauci besides being
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:46.760]  an md i mean he's he's never treated any of these patients if you look at his track record across
[2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:51.960]  the sars one uh you know you would you would think he was a totally different person it's it's
[2:33:51.960 --> 2:33:56.840]  you know dr fauci and mr hide so i think he's a very dangerous individual i'll probably get
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:34:03.160]  in trouble more for saying that but look i have i have family i have people i love i have children
[2:34:03.160 --> 2:34:11.480]  and grandchildren i don't want this garbage this poison in our world wow we've got one more segment

[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:07.240]  liars but that doesn't mean that they don't have power just like the southern prairie loss center
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:12.440]  that's just as bad they represent the globalist the big power structure that wants authoritarianism
[2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:17.160]  and backs communist china and its death camps and they back bringing those similar systems here to
[2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:23.000]  america and they've even officially called the adl for my arrest for my speech and for mark

[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:23.960]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide i'm alex jones your host codder jane ruby's
[2:39:23.960 --> 2:39:29.640]  our guest all right matt bracken does a great job on thursday's host of the fourth hour former
[2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:35.800]  navy seal best-selling author predicted so much of what's unfolding right now i sometimes co-host
[2:39:35.800 --> 2:39:39.720]  with him and i'm deciding today to do a few segments with him uh coming up because
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:48.760]  biden came out in the so-called joint address in congress and want to say save the union
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:56.840]  and said anybody we define as a white supremacist is now a terrorist and we're going to use the cia in
[2:39:56.840 --> 2:40:01.160]  the military and that fits into the fbi and cia statements of the pentagon statements about the
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:05.880]  main enemy being white supremacist in america meaning half the population this this this is
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:11.000]  the communist takeover and it's absolutely out of control it's totally insane but it's what sake
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:15.320]  and all of them have said and deba nunez a ranking republican on the house intelligence committee
[2:40:15.320 --> 2:40:19.000]  said it two weeks ago he said no they're having hearings in closed session about their main enemy
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:24.760]  being us so they always heard about marshal law and mass arrest plans i remember nick stanman's
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:28.040]  a white supremacist and all this because he you know because the racist people got in his face
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:34.200]  this is all coming to a head and i want to know how we stop it peacefully because things are boiling
[2:40:34.200 --> 2:40:41.640]  down to crises and really the end of the republic and that also ties into the bloomberg global
[2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:49.800]  analysis of agris spot index shows the biggest food price increase in modern history now happening
[2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:53.640]  and it's already in the raw material level it's going to telegraph the next few months to your
[2:40:53.640 --> 2:41:00.040]  table worldwide that signals massive unrest last time it even had half an increase this big we had
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:05.480]  the air of spring which the globalist road towards islamic takeover of much of africa and the middle
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:10.840]  east and parts of central asia that's coming up as well that's why bill gauge is mine up on the farm
[2:41:10.840 --> 2:41:15.160]  land so this is serious stuff i don't just start with the strongest stuff up at the front of the
[2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:22.360]  show i i just it's all important at all times together and my guts never wrong the older i
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:26.840]  get the more i learn to follow my intuition i intellectually study constantly but my gut is
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:31.160]  get out of the city get out of the city get prepared get ready this is a full assault they're not just
[2:41:31.160 --> 2:41:36.120]  hitting us with a gmo frankins system the changes are very dna and it's already maiming and killing
[2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:41.560]  people in mass and testing to see how much they can kill us it's all a test they're now saying that
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:46.200]  people that are pro america are terrorists that that's why they're calling black commentators that
[2:41:46.200 --> 2:41:51.640]  that are pro america white supremacist and uncle tom's uh like the black senator you know that you
[2:41:51.640 --> 2:41:55.720]  know that gave the rebuttal last night they're calling him horrible names this is a real takeover
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:42:00.360]  folks by mega banks by the elites it's really scary dr jane ruby i want you to be able to finish
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:04.760]  up on the whole covet thing and all of that and also you cover stuff happening in dc you see what's
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:08.280]  happening in the country just your general view of the state of the world right now i'd love to
[2:42:08.280 --> 2:42:15.960]  pick your brain about that well just to address that uh really quickly uh you know i i still have
[2:42:15.960 --> 2:42:21.160]  a lot of connections i was in dc for 10 years i did make an escape to palm beach a few months ago
[2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:26.840]  uh because simply not just for the great weather but you know because this freedom was was still
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:31.240]  available here and i think that a lot of people are starting to do that i i heed your warning
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:36.360]  about getting out of the cities i think people should do i've had some went to a very private
[2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:42.040]  security briefing here in bokeh at a private home with some some names of people who drove down to
[2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:47.320]  keep under the radar uh from dc these are very respected people you would recognize their names
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:52.920]  uh the good guys and they told us that we are essentially in the middle of a marxist coup this
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:42:57.560]  whole covet thing the vaccine everything we're talking about and we're trying to educate people on
[2:42:57.560 --> 2:43:02.840]  is actually part as you well know alex part and parcel of the the whole operation uh and
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:07.720]  then we have a very short window of time to turn things around uh and and one of them is to to prep
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:13.560]  and they did coincidentally mention that in the second quarter of this year probably late in the
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:18.520]  quarter that that there were things that were going to happen that would affect supplies and that
[2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:24.120]  people should for stock up on six to twelve months that include your medications if you're on any
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:29.640]  prescription meds pay it yourself for the rest of the year things like that so um i so i wanted to
[2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:35.240]  just you know affirm what what i've heard on my end uh the people i i've left behind in dc who are
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:41.160]  political operatives activists you know many of them they've been on your show uh they are very
[2:43:41.160 --> 2:43:46.520]  depressed uh on one level because they they do know that this is real and that this is happening
[2:43:46.520 --> 2:43:53.320]  um and so maybe that leads a little bit to uh your question to me around what what can people do
[2:43:53.320 --> 2:43:59.160]  what should we be doing going forward maybe from my perspective uh i would say that you need to
[2:43:59.160 --> 2:44:04.680]  continue to educate yourself through shows like this many shows there's still a lot of information
[2:44:04.680 --> 2:44:09.640]  even though it's being censored that you can find on the internet you need to push back on the
[2:44:09.640 --> 2:44:14.280]  medical officials the school officials uh that have already been infiltrated by the way by the
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:19.720]  democrats radical muslims have infiltrated school boards local areas we've got to reclaim
[2:44:19.720 --> 2:44:24.920]  those positions those elections um you got to push back on those and and the biggest thing i would
[2:44:24.920 --> 2:44:31.400]  say alex is we've got to protect the children the the children you know are are the future there's
[2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:39.480]  no reason on earth why why this these injectables these experimental injections should be anywhere
[2:44:39.480 --> 2:44:46.520]  near children they will 100 uh chance of recovery number one they don't spread it uh and they should
[2:44:46.520 --> 2:44:54.920]  not have their dna modified uh this this is really a a a big red this is a genetic takeover by bill
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:45:00.040]  gates and the globalists and i mean there's jellyfish gene and the whole genome of a dead boy
[2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:05.160]  in the fizer shot and then a chimpanzee genome in the in one of the other ones i mean this is and
[2:45:05.160 --> 2:45:11.480]  then they won't tell you why it's in there they say oh that's proprietary that's secret no and and
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:16.920]  that's not allowed alex that should have been disclosed if you could get your hands on an
[2:45:16.920 --> 2:45:22.280]  irb stamped informed consent well think about six month old babies they don't have any consent
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:27.640]  that's now being done to them this is pure evil man it is pure evil especially babies
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:34.760]  of women of childbearing age and alex i suspect just just from my um just from my medical education
[2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:41.240]  i have a feeling that the common denominator is the protein sequences in these spike proteins
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:46.760]  that are are being that that these injections are forcing your cells to replicate there's
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:51.800]  something in that sequence in that pattern that is it is connected to the rest of your body and
[2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:57.800]  that's what is what we all will do another set it's associated with the brain the uterus the
[2:45:57.800 --> 2:46:03.080]  placenta a lot of other fast growing proteins and they can either cut those off attack those or grow
[2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:09.560]  them causing brain fog you name it i mean this is a this is a bio weapon it is definitely a bio
[2:46:09.560 --> 2:46:15.720]  weapon uh regardless of where it it came out of um well the next team is the bio weapon exactly
[2:46:16.600 --> 2:46:22.200]  it absolutely is and it's the gift that's going to keep giving to the globalists because now
[2:46:22.200 --> 2:46:28.680]  we're seeing uh you see some information coming out today more and more about the potential
[2:46:28.680 --> 2:46:34.680]  for people who have been vaccinated to be shedding something and we don't know what yet
[2:46:34.680 --> 2:46:39.000]  that is affecting other people's menstrual cycles other people's blood clotting
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:44.680]  cascade absolutely listen doctor i'm really impressed with you i've seen other shows you're

[2:50:53.800 --> 2:50:59.480]  billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world it causes a chain reaction
[2:50:59.480 --> 2:51:04.200]  that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world well now you're hearing
[2:51:04.200 --> 2:51:08.600]  about gas shortages all over the united states that's because the companies and the systems and
[2:51:08.600 --> 2:51:13.400]  the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:17.880]  plus the keystone pipelines have been shut down along with other pipelines the left is now blowing

[2:51:33.720 --> 2:51:38.760]  they're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer
[2:51:38.760 --> 2:51:43.160]  so they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family

[2:51:54.280 --> 2:52:00.760]  i remember when i remember i remember when i lost my mind

[2:52:07.320 --> 2:52:12.280]  that bracket joins us next segment and boy we're gonna cover key intel i hope you stay with us
[2:52:12.280 --> 2:52:17.400]  let me tell everybody you know tune in now you are the power you are everything when you take
[2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:21.880]  action you're able to tune in right now the most critical information ever might declare an open
[2:52:21.880 --> 2:52:28.440]  war against the american people it is insane it just it was a cherry on top for me that's coming up
[2:52:30.200 --> 2:52:33.160]  rob do came to me this morning and he said have you noticed
[2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:43.400]  that the media is saying that biden had the most popular state of the union ever 85 percent loved
[2:52:43.400 --> 2:52:48.600]  it but that all the comments on facebook twitter youtube you name it were two to one five to one
[2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:55.000]  ten to one or more against biden and it's also come out that youtube is adjusted on the white
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:53:01.960]  house channel last time i checked 60 plus million dislikes to likes they used to call that engaging
[2:53:03.160 --> 2:53:12.760]  in fraud so here is cbs news posted in yahoo finance 85 percent of viewers
[2:53:12.760 --> 2:53:20.600]  approve of biden's address to congress look at this headline we're gonna go through this video
[2:53:20.600 --> 2:53:28.360]  this in a moment and then place it right next to other polls and and and and other people's
[2:53:28.360 --> 2:53:35.320]  votes online showing unanimously people absolutely hated it but oh don't worry the fake news media
[2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:40.360]  wants to shut down the independent media because they don't want their gas lighting to be challenged
[2:53:40.360 --> 2:53:46.680]  so let's go ahead and roll this video of cbs news trying to gaslight us and say that 85 percent of
[2:53:46.680 --> 2:53:51.880]  people like to speech and like biden the most popular man in world history according to them
[2:53:51.880 --> 2:53:57.320]  here it is we have to do more than just build back better to build back have to build back better
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:54:03.560]  how have americans been responding to the president's address hey there elaine you all
[2:54:03.560 --> 2:54:08.600]  were talking about the president's polling in the last segment so that was a very nice segue here
[2:54:08.600 --> 2:54:14.360]  uh because we have some new polling what we did was we talked to we talked to a sample
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:20.040]  representative sample of the audience nationwide who watched the speech and they liked what they
[2:54:20.040 --> 2:54:26.680]  heard they're 85 percent approving of the speech now i've got to add right off the bat here that
[2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:33.800]  as is typical with presidential speeches a lot of his own partisans made up the bulk of the audience
[2:54:33.800 --> 2:54:39.880]  so this audience was majority democrats watching it you know for context back when president
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:44.440]  trump was giving speeches a lot of republicans watched those so that's you got to know that
[2:54:44.440 --> 2:54:50.760]  behind these numbers but that said the audience said that they liked what they heard and then
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:55.080]  how did they describe it well this is a word we found in other polling and again in this one
[2:54:55.080 --> 2:55:01.400]  people using to describe joe biden presidential uh tearing in this case they thought the speech
[2:55:01.400 --> 2:55:05.080]  and many thought the speech was inspiring and then this one folks have been talking about
[2:55:05.080 --> 2:55:12.040]  where his plans you know big uh where the things that people wanted and this word bold was used by
[2:55:12.040 --> 2:55:17.640]  80 percent of the audience too so to that extent our advice mark if you want to go back to this in
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:21.720]  a minute what they do is they have an allowed group in their focus group that they give these
[2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:27.240]  little clicker machines for the internet and then when they give the people they know like biden
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:31.560]  you know quote a half of them are moderates and then you know the quarter republican and
[2:55:31.560 --> 2:55:35.960]  the quarter democrat wink wink they're they're all democrats and then they just hand them
[2:55:35.960 --> 2:55:41.480]  oh look the the independent group all loves it that's how the clown world works let's continue
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:52.520]  80 percent of the audience too so to that extent he kind of hit his mark if he wanted to convey
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:57.960]  bold it seems like he did elaine interesting well what did people make Anthony of the tone of
[2:55:57.960 --> 2:56:05.000]  president biden's speech did they feel he was unifying in his remarks uh yes that also came
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:10.680]  up we also did see unifying and of course that's been one of his campaign promises right to be
[2:56:10.680 --> 2:56:16.840]  unifying to the country to reach out to be bipartisan we've seen in the national polling
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:24.680]  that led up to this people did think that he was reaching out to republicans that is what you call
[2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:28.680]  massive gaslighting we're going to post this report to band on video uh here's just a small
[2:56:28.680 --> 2:56:35.960]  sampling of what he did last night in regard to russia i know a concern some of you but i made
[2:56:35.960 --> 2:56:42.840]  very clear to prudent that we're not going to seek us actually excuse me escalation

[2:58:41.800 --> 2:58:47.960]  is taking over but let me walk you through this and i know i've talked a lot about this
[2:58:47.960 --> 2:58:54.120]  but i wanted to really burn in for everybody that they've crossed the rubicon and for those
[2:58:54.120 --> 2:59:02.760]  that don't know 2040 something years ago julia seizer had been in germania and gulf for 15 years
[2:59:02.760 --> 2:59:08.200]  or whatever he was the biggest conqueror the romans had ever had and they had a rule if if if
[2:59:08.200 --> 2:59:16.520]  if members of the senate or generals brought troops across the rubicon into italy and into
[2:59:16.520 --> 2:59:22.280]  roam it was treason they'd be killed well when you cross the rubicon with your troops it means
[2:59:22.280 --> 2:59:28.440]  you're about to take everybody over it doesn't matter what they do a war is happening now when i
[2:59:28.440 --> 2:59:33.080]  saw this this morning because i didn't watch it last night i got to stop the 18 hour a day stuff
[2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:40.440]  was i just go crazy but i i watched it this morning when i saw him say what we're about to play
[2:59:40.440 --> 2:59:48.680]  we're getting that bracket's take on this al qaeda is not the issue isis isn't the issue open
[2:59:48.680 --> 2:59:54.040]  borders isn't the issue it's terrorists in america who are white supremacists and if you're a white
[2:59:54.040 --> 2:59:58.680]  supremacist you're a terrorist now even if you're a white supremacist that's your right to do it
[2:59:58.680 --> 3:00:06.760]  black supremacist you name it that's your right but they called anybody right of moussey tongue
[3:00:06.760 --> 3:00:11.320]  a white supremacist i'm called it everybody's called it tucker carlson's called it but by
[3:00:11.320 --> 3:00:17.320]  mainstream news it's a dehumanization so punch a nazi well you're a nazi i'm gonna punch you
[3:00:17.320 --> 3:00:22.440]  i'm gonna come to your house i'm antifa kill nazis they're captain america we're red skull
[3:00:22.440 --> 3:00:27.640]  even though george sorrell's actually helped the nazis and so they've had the u.s intelligence
[3:00:27.640 --> 3:00:32.680]  agencies the cia the pentagon the secretary of defense all say along with the justice department
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:37.320]  and the fbi we're gonna break up trump networks we're gonna break up networks claiming election
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:45.960]  fraud we're gonna break up the organizations out there like the oathkeepers and and we're
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:51.080]  going to disrupt their networks and that means put you on the fly list taking your bank accounts
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:55.960]  even people that didn't even go to the capital or go into it but we're on the ellipse to hear the
[3:00:55.960 --> 3:01:04.920]  president speak you're bad too so this is crossing the rubicon in spades then he says in the speech
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:12.040]  just like sake said months ago when they first got in at the press secretary we are using the
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:18.280]  intelligence agencies to go after the trump people and then they define it not as wanting to load
[3:01:18.280 --> 3:01:25.640]  a truck bomb up and kill people no but just terrorism and is wrong by anybody black lives
[3:01:25.640 --> 3:01:28.840]  matter and anti-full and they're doing it burning down police stations shooting cops
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:37.320]  but they said if you're a white supremacist and that's if they say you are so it's on and then
[3:01:37.320 --> 3:01:40.680]  deba nunez was in closed hearings two weeks ago he said that's all they're talking about they're
[3:01:40.680 --> 3:01:45.400]  talking about iran they're not even talking about china they're talking about al qaeda al nazar isis
[3:01:45.400 --> 3:01:56.440]  they're talking about the nr a oh the nr a's being called terrorist so this is it ladies and
[3:01:56.440 --> 3:02:00.680]  gentlemen and new york's trying to take down their attorney general the the nr a they want to
[3:02:00.680 --> 3:02:06.680]  criminally charge them because they flew around on some private jets you can ride around in a golden
[3:02:06.680 --> 3:02:11.080]  jet if you keep my second amendment i mean the point is is that that's where this is so
[3:02:11.080 --> 3:02:15.800]  so clearly they're going to have a summer of rage every time a cop does something even halfway
[3:02:15.800 --> 3:02:19.720]  questionable they're going to burn cities down and that's going to be the cover for what i'll cover
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:29.160]  after matt bracken comments on this and that is overhead shot please one bank warns soaring
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:33.960]  food prices will lead to social unrest zero hedge info wars dot com here's the bloomberg

[3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:33.000]  small operators went out of business and went bankrupt and all the new regulations and they
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:39.400]  shut down multiple pipelines coming this summer gas stations running out of gas cnn celebrates it
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:43.720]  this will lower your carbon footprint oh you thought you'd get out and go somewhere too late
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:50.520]  all the liberals love staying at home watching netflix all the schools were closed everything else
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:56.760]  you're going to live under a bridge now hyper inflation ladies and gentlemen so they're going
[3:03:56.760 --> 3:04:03.480]  to pincer attack us with civil unrest saying it's white supremacists have leftist white groups
[3:04:03.480 --> 3:04:08.360]  lead groups of black people to burn down cities then if you oppose it anyway you're a white supremacist
[3:04:08.360 --> 3:04:11.880]  and then they bring in the fbi and the police they're taking over the police departments
[3:04:12.600 --> 3:04:15.880]  in some jurisdictions they've lost a third of their police they're just putting communists in
[3:04:15.880 --> 3:04:21.800]  there fast-tracking them uh they're hiring illegal aliens as police this is the final takeover i
[3:04:21.800 --> 3:04:25.720]  thought it was just a beta test they were going to normalize their dictatorship no they're moving
[3:04:25.720 --> 3:04:29.160]  ahead just like the bolsheviks did because they know they don't have full control of the country
[3:04:29.160 --> 3:04:35.880]  they have a beachhead in dc just like the bolsheviks did for 15 years in moscow and some of the other
[3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:40.840]  cities that they had there in the western area of russia so joining us is matt bracken former navy
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:45.080]  seal great author researcher enemies foreign domestic dot com got three minutes to break you've
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:49.800]  heard my synopsis uh do you agree with me is there any doubt i mean this is it
[3:04:49.800 --> 3:04:56.600]  i think they're going for broke there's no there's no question they have this window
[3:04:57.160 --> 3:05:03.400]  where they've got a a puppet you know i i i never say biden says anymore or you know because
[3:05:03.400 --> 3:05:09.240]  biden doesn't know what he's saying he could read the uh you know the telephone book he wouldn't
[3:05:09.240 --> 3:05:15.400]  know the difference so it's whoever is writing his teleprompter speech is running our country
[3:05:15.400 --> 3:05:20.840]  and we don't even know who that is maybe it's obama through the earpiece like he said last
[3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:27.480]  november he would like to do via susan rice that's plausible but we don't know who's running the
[3:05:27.480 --> 3:05:34.520]  country but they're globalists this is this is the full push for communism you know the the total
[3:05:34.520 --> 3:05:40.920]  budget when you add up the regular budget plus the green new deal slash infrastructure you know the
[3:05:40.920 --> 3:05:49.320]  uh medicare for medic for all kindergarten to college this is communism you know 11 trillion
[3:05:49.320 --> 3:05:55.480]  dollars is what they're talking about that's 11 000 billion dollars that's 11 million million
[3:05:55.480 --> 3:06:00.600]  dollars this is going to be hyperinflation and let's be clear they're taking it while it still
[3:06:00.600 --> 3:06:06.520]  has value in buying foreign stocks buying mining companies buying raw land uh buying
[3:06:06.520 --> 3:06:12.200]  weapon stocks medical stocks they're buying villas in switzerland they plan to end the us folks i mean
[3:06:12.200 --> 3:06:18.200]  they are literally economically devastating us and in the short term very short term like in
[3:06:18.200 --> 3:06:25.000]  weimar germany there might be a sugar high but this this hyperinflation is now built in but unlike
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:30.280]  weimar germany there won't be wheelbarrows full of money you know you physically had to take money
[3:06:30.280 --> 3:06:37.320]  to the to the uh food store to try to find a loaf of bread you know the this time it'll just be loaded
[3:06:37.320 --> 3:06:43.960]  on to ebt cards and you won't know if your neighbor who's a good comrade maybe the algorithm is saying
[3:06:43.960 --> 3:06:49.560]  good comrades get double digits and that's exactly what the soviets did people that were good little
[3:06:49.560 --> 3:06:56.200]  soviets they got double triple their rations other people got nine and and this is going to
[3:06:56.200 --> 3:07:02.360]  lead to massive resentment you know when you're at walmart and you know you see the welfare mama
[3:07:02.360 --> 3:07:08.920]  loading up the stakes because she got you know triple uh digital books it's going to lead to
[3:07:08.920 --> 3:07:13.160]  tremendous resentment i think that and by the way they admit those digital books can only go to
[3:07:13.160 --> 3:07:18.520]  certain companies even within a store the university is already saying you can't leave for the semester
[3:07:18.520 --> 3:07:25.160]  and you only can spend money at stores we say this is a total planned economy and only on products
[3:07:25.160 --> 3:07:32.120]  that we say if you try to you try to buy unauthorized things like uh like ammunition or gun magazines
[3:07:32.120 --> 3:07:36.840]  it's going to just say decline god this is gonna blow sky high stay there mad bragging this is it
[3:07:36.840 --> 3:07:44.600]  folks i thought we had time it's that they're making their move my god and i look at all the dumb
[3:07:44.600 --> 3:07:48.520]  commies that can't even wipe their ass they're gonna be in the worst position during this we'll be right
[3:07:48.520 --> 3:08:01.560]  back it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful
[3:08:02.760 --> 3:08:10.040]  is known as the builder bird could their objective be world domination for thousands of years their
[3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:17.000]  dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:23.400]  80 percent of humanity is in hand the globalist fear this film made 14 years ago it is the blueprint
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:27.320]  for their plan to figure with the world it is the blueprint for the great reset it is in game
[3:08:27.320 --> 3:08:31.960]  blueprint for global enslavement available right now at info or store dot com with a zero country
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:36.600]  code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world i strongly suggest you get the film
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:41.720]  in game at info or store dot com i strongly suggest you make copies and share it and if you take that
[3:08:41.720 --> 3:08:46.440]  action i demand you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well
[3:08:46.440 --> 3:08:50.920]  that will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped
[3:08:55.400 --> 3:08:59.160]  granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air go ahead
[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:04.680]  challenge first of all let me say i'd love your products i am a granny and um for all the
[3:09:04.680 --> 3:09:09.720]  seniors citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with
[3:09:09.720 --> 3:09:15.640]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[3:09:15.640 --> 3:09:23.240]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already
[3:09:23.240 --> 3:09:27.880]  taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because
[3:09:27.880 --> 3:09:32.360]  i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it i mean it doesn't happen
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:38.680]  immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket
[3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:44.680]  this is working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you
[3:09:44.680 --> 3:09:49.720]  know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[3:09:54.120 --> 3:10:00.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:10:00.600 --> 3:10:08.600]  you
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:13.000]  throughout history you've never picked up a world history almanac
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:17.400]  it's hundreds different versions different versions of history but they're 500 pages a
[3:10:17.400 --> 3:10:22.200]  thousand pages long i've probably read for seeing scan through 30 or 40 of them alive
[3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:26.440]  i was a kid i used to love to get them at different libraries we go to different libraries
[3:10:26.440 --> 3:10:32.200]  and each page was a whole country a whole history a whole period and it was constant wars and
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:37.640]  subterfuge and takeovers and king's ordering the first born children killed and human sacrifices
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:44.200]  and vikings taking over and plundering and the Aztecs chopping people's hearts out that's why
[3:10:44.200 --> 3:10:48.920]  history was so fascinating to me it was way better in the comic books and so now it's happening here
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:55.880]  hardcore criminals using psychological warfare matt bracken sir with us uh he's been predicting
[3:10:55.880 --> 3:11:04.120]  all this he's been laying it out in articles and in books he's written and here it is on infowars.com
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:10.680]  the bloomberg agri spot index the highest has ever been since it was created 76 food increase in
[3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:16.840]  just the next six months that's at the baseline from the farms right now that is a massive increase
[3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:21.880]  that will guarantee they're saying huge civil unrest alone but they're not going to blame it
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:26.600]  on the big banks and on inflation and on the federal reserve and the Rothschilds everybody no no no
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:31.800]  it's going to be black lives matter when a cop does something halfway questionable when a black
[3:11:31.800 --> 3:11:36.520]  guy charges a cop with a knife down the cop shoots him the media is like hey it's a white guy
[3:11:36.520 --> 3:11:40.760]  it's a cover for the collapse they want to scapegoat black people and white people
[3:11:42.040 --> 3:11:45.880]  we've got to see through this and then you've got of course bill gates tells you you shouldn't
[3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:52.520]  known land you shouldn't have farm remember uh what did uh bloomberg say a few years ago he goes
[3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:57.080]  only idiots farm all he does put a seed in the ground it's so easy oh yeah right it's so easy
[3:11:57.080 --> 3:12:03.240]  bill gates buying up a huge amount of farmland while great reset tells america's future it's not
[3:12:03.240 --> 3:12:09.720]  in private property he's the biggest farm owner here in the united states now they know what they're
[3:12:09.720 --> 3:12:17.080]  doing don't they mad virgin yeah the the great reset is the same as is exactly the same as
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:24.040]  communism 2.0 it's they've just coming they're coming at it with a different public relations
[3:12:24.040 --> 3:12:29.560]  angle but the outcome is going to be exactly the same there people think that communism
[3:12:30.360 --> 3:12:36.040]  in in the Soviet Union for example everybody was poor everybody was equal but miserable
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:41.720]  that's not true there was a class called the nomenclatura class uh that they're like the
[3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:48.280]  named comrades they they they um shopped in special stores where you had to use a special
[3:12:48.280 --> 3:12:53.400]  currency called a gold certificate ruble or well it was in the spanish civil war he was a socialist
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:56.920]  fought with the communist and that's why he later wrote 1944 he said the comics were as bad as the
[3:12:56.920 --> 3:13:03.240]  facts are worse he said they would go to special hotels with caviar and cream and high-end hookers
[3:13:03.240 --> 3:13:07.320]  and and party all day and he's like the peasants are dying fighting the nazis they're like screw
[3:13:07.320 --> 3:13:13.160]  you let's bring some hookers that's what they do sorry go ahead it's great for if you're you know
[3:13:13.160 --> 3:13:18.920]  it's like the old melbrook's movie it's great to be king you know when when the rest of the society
[3:13:18.920 --> 3:13:24.840]  is reduced is reduced to being you know peasants that are fighting for a living dumpster diving
[3:13:24.840 --> 3:13:31.080]  you know picking up you know scrap food wherever they can this is actually great for the members
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:36.920]  of the elite they can just cruise around spot a pretty girl send an agent out like uh saddam
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:42.280]  used to do and say hey you know you're going to get a big chance here to come up to the castle
[3:13:42.280 --> 3:13:46.920]  this could you know this could lift you out of the uh and you're being too nice you're being too nice
[3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:50.920]  tens of millions starved to death just in the first decade of the bolshevik takeover so people
[3:13:50.920 --> 3:13:57.400]  are lucky to eat out of dumpsters and people did starve to death and at the time there was very
[3:13:57.400 --> 3:14:01.560]  little photography but there are black and white pictures you can see of you know dead
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:07.480]  children in the street just snow covered people were literally starving a difference now is
[3:14:07.480 --> 3:14:14.520]  that we have new media people with the ability to to record video and transmit it this is a
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:19.560]  two-edged sword obviously the you know the anytime that they can get a police shooting they can use
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:26.440]  it to whip up racial anger sometimes the video goes you know will exonerate the cop like the
[3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:31.320]  stabbing in uh the nearest stabbing in columbus so there are some differences between now and
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:35.880]  a hundred years ago the speed that information can be gotten out so this is they're getting
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:41.720]  ready you will never have me anymore you will eat bugs you will drink sewage water they're telling
[3:14:41.720 --> 3:14:48.680]  us this is a utopia yeah i don't think they'll be eating bugs you know something tells me that
[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:54.600]  the that the Gulfstream jet crowd is not going to be eating bugs and but they are going to have
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:59.880]  you know the the best parts of the world will just be for the elites the peasants will be on
[3:14:59.880 --> 3:15:06.440]  semi lockdown forever i watched the last hour with dr ruby that was great and and from the
[3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:12.040]  medical perspective she's spot on but there's like a social control mechanism too they've got
[3:15:12.040 --> 3:15:18.360]  to get the vaccinations up to say 90 percent then they can really crack down on the dissidents
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:22.520]  and they're going to start associating the dissidents with any any new outbreaks will
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:28.200]  be blamed on the vaccine refuse next and who will be you know the same as the the white
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:32.600]  and that's why we've got to get very aggressive like tucker carlson non-violently but they're
[3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:37.160]  trying to bully us we've got to say no to the school boards no to the politicians and get
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:41.240]  people in like the santas that are going to hold the line hanging on the offense against this mass
[3:15:41.240 --> 3:15:46.920]  cult and i'm not i'm not trying to take us back to the vaccine from the last hour which i recommend
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:53.480]  that show but here in jackson villanston the news some of the giant vaccination sites there they
[3:15:53.480 --> 3:16:01.800]  were going from 1200 vaccinations a day at these sites down to 30 now people are the word is getting
[3:16:01.800 --> 3:16:08.360]  out the the sheep that stampeded to get their vaccines they were the early adapters they were
[3:16:08.360 --> 3:16:13.480]  the you know the ones that are wearing triple masks you know outrunning um they've already
[3:16:13.480 --> 3:16:18.600]  gotten their vaccines those of us with more sense who have studied this some more they're
[3:16:18.600 --> 3:16:24.280]  they're hitting a wall probably less than 50 vaccinated so this man i totally agree with
[3:16:24.280 --> 3:16:27.960]  you they're trying to suppress the numbers i've got the numbers it's less than 20 of taking it
[3:16:28.520 --> 3:16:33.800]  that's why the scene of headlines are oh uh you know 60 of taking it or planned to but the actual
[3:16:33.800 --> 3:16:38.920]  number a few weeks ago was at 15 so i'm guessing it's about 20 there's a mass awakening happening
[3:16:38.920 --> 3:16:45.080]  right now that's got a really pissed the globalist off and and this is part of the biggest brainwashing
[3:16:45.080 --> 3:16:51.320]  effort i've ever seen in my life going back to watching walter kronkite you know vietnam era
[3:16:51.880 --> 3:16:56.680]  when they were doing it turned out he was a globalist he hid that fact you know he was the
[3:16:56.680 --> 3:17:03.080]  most trusted man in america after he retires from cbs it turns out he was a president of the world
[3:17:03.080 --> 3:17:08.440]  federalist society which is like a you know secret davis world economic forum i have the video of
[3:17:08.440 --> 3:17:13.320]  him saying that he sits at the right end of the devil and wants world government but all the way
[3:17:13.320 --> 3:17:18.440]  back then i've been studying brainwashing and that was when there were only a couple channels i've
[3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:25.720]  never seen anything like this vaccination push this is very soviet you know the local news you've
[3:17:25.720 --> 3:17:30.600]  seen these things occasionally where you think it's your local news reporter but it's really a
[3:17:30.600 --> 3:17:36.600]  syndicate of stations and they're all reading the exact same script about the vaccines and
[3:17:36.600 --> 3:17:43.320]  everybody needs to take it but pushing it on children to me is so evil doing this dna modification
[3:17:43.320 --> 3:17:50.440]  on children and inserting this spike protein into their into their dna i mean this is an extremely
[3:17:50.440 --> 3:17:55.800]  diabolical and evil scheme that they're unleashing i mean it's almost and it means and it means
[3:17:55.800 --> 3:17:59.400]  they're going for broke they wouldn't have pulled something that's going to cause this much death
[3:17:59.400 --> 3:18:04.040]  and carnage if they weren't planning something bigger that's so horrible we forget about what
[3:18:04.040 --> 3:18:12.200]  already happened and the the wuhan lab is almost is almost like an analogy or or a um a parallel for
[3:18:12.200 --> 3:18:19.480]  the entire situation here we have our corporate medical pharma interests financing this research
[3:18:19.480 --> 3:18:24.920]  in communist china and that's what we're seeing so they have plausible denominated merger explain
[3:18:24.920 --> 3:18:28.120]  that we come back and then i'm gonna hit one more thing and have you take over and i want you to
[3:18:28.120 --> 3:18:32.200]  join me anytime you want on the main show that the fourth hour just because in the other hour
[3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:36.200]  i'd like to get you on as a guest to pick your brain about this matt bracken i've got one more
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:39.560]  point to hit that we're going to hand the baton to matt bracken the other side then the war room
[3:18:39.560 --> 3:18:52.120]  with old shroyer is coming up in about 32 minutes from now you know listeners calling to the show
[3:18:52.120 --> 3:18:58.600]  and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there and i beg you for support

[3:19:59.640 --> 3:20:04.120]  all this stupidity wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay
[3:20:04.120 --> 3:20:11.480]  i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense

[3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:23.720]  brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now
[3:20:23.720 --> 3:20:31.880]  this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you
[3:20:31.880 --> 3:20:38.600]  shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray
[3:20:38.600 --> 3:20:44.200]  one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's
[3:20:44.200 --> 3:20:48.360]  name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it
[3:20:48.360 --> 3:20:54.520]  because god created this country the scientific dictatorship that i've been warning you about
[3:20:54.520 --> 3:21:00.440]  for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational the globalists are out on the open

[3:21:15.640 --> 3:21:20.280]  the attack that's happening we have a real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance we will
[3:21:20.280 --> 3:21:25.000]  defeat it so prayer is essential research is essential getting prepared is essential and

[3:23:40.440 --> 3:23:46.840]  radio listeners i want to encourage everybody to go read this article for yourself that's
[3:23:46.840 --> 3:23:56.600]  on info wars dot com one bank warns soaring food prices will lead to social unrest
[3:23:58.440 --> 3:24:03.880]  and it shows 75 76 food increases now already starting and that's going to cost
[3:24:03.880 --> 3:24:07.000]  a little rest of problems what have i been telling you for months here you need to get
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:12.920]  high quality shortable foods and i want to explain something here i don't promote things just because
[3:24:12.920 --> 3:24:19.960]  i make money off of them i go out and promote things that i'm personally doing that i'm personally
[3:24:19.960 --> 3:24:25.960]  using so it's a win-win like going back eight years ago i thought that gold was going to be
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:29.800]  artificially driven down i told people buy it for years they double triple their money i started
[3:24:29.800 --> 3:24:33.000]  telling folks let's get out of gold probably because they're an artificially impressive
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:37.720]  and silver people got mad at me but it was true and most of my listeners cashed in and ended up
[3:24:37.720 --> 3:24:42.840]  saving their their their profit the last couple years i've said inflation's back they're having
[3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:48.840]  trouble suppressing gold and silver i'd get back in it it's back up but food is the smartest thing
[3:24:48.840 --> 3:24:54.680]  water filtration firearms friends family a bug out plan these are things that are essential
[3:24:54.680 --> 3:24:58.520]  for everyone as hard as i fight here against the globalists i don't have a lot of time to do that
[3:24:58.520 --> 3:25:03.400]  but i've been doing it more myself uh you know putting in the water well get the tractor planting
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:09.160]  garden putting a trailer you know out the middle of nowhere uh because that's where this world's
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:15.560]  going folks and that's how serious it is that that they really want a prolonged year long two
[3:25:15.560 --> 3:25:20.920]  year three year lockdown with real bio weapons released and in real riots to make us fall to
[3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:27.000]  our knees so i hope we can short circuit this i hope cooler heads prevail i hope the republicans
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:31.560]  wake up and say no but them they're mainly can you know bullied now lynn chaney all of them are
[3:25:31.560 --> 3:25:35.800]  the leaders of the party now uh and and and and they're said they're going to go along with a biden
[3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:40.760]  and let him engage in election fraud supreme court's rolling over or they'll pack the court well
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:44.760]  they're already packed and they're already controlled so i would go to info or store.com

[3:26:09.560 --> 3:26:14.360]  and they're probably gonna have price increases in the future but i said i'm your biggest seller

[3:27:17.720 --> 3:27:23.000]  this situation and what we can do and boy have you been proven right my friend well first of all
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:30.760]  just listening to that spot i have to i have to take my hat off and salute you you know talk about
[3:27:30.760 --> 3:27:36.840]  turning uh lemons into lemonade high quality lemonade the best you know that they've been
[3:27:36.840 --> 3:27:42.840]  gunning for you for years really for decades but they've been ramping it up so hard in the last
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:48.760]  couple of years and being thrown off a youtube and thrown out of you know conventional social media
[3:27:48.760 --> 3:27:55.880]  you had to build your entire vertically and horizontally integrated system completely
[3:27:56.440 --> 3:28:02.440]  putting everything you know under your own control so you wouldn't wind up like parlor
[3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:09.800]  you know with amazon servers yanking the rug out so this is really a model for people to follow
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:15.720]  you know in in my own little way you know with my own little book book empire i try to do the
[3:28:15.720 --> 3:28:22.840]  same thing i try to be as independent as i can because if if you're relying on you know corporations
[3:28:22.840 --> 3:28:29.080]  or bureaucracies that in the end hate your guts and would just as soon see you put on a box car
[3:28:29.640 --> 3:28:35.560]  then you're either going to have to um you know run into the wilderness like some post apocalyptic
[3:28:35.560 --> 3:28:41.240]  mad max scenario where you've got nothing you know you just what you can carry on your back and
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:48.360]  that's it or you're going to have to bend the knee and and knuckle under and and just be a good
[3:28:48.360 --> 3:28:55.160]  soviet citizen and hope to fly under the radar but flying under the radar is increasingly it's
[3:28:55.160 --> 3:29:02.760]  not going to work because you know unfortunately our demographics are now becoming our our
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:10.360]  bad comrad id card that we can't hide you know we can't hide the fact that you know we're over
[3:29:10.360 --> 3:29:17.240]  50 that where we come from a jodeo christian background that we are come from you know our
[3:29:17.240 --> 3:29:25.240]  ancestors came from europe these are all now marks of the oppressor and the society at large is being
[3:29:25.240 --> 3:29:32.200]  given permission to just come at us there's only one group left where you can just make jokes
[3:29:32.200 --> 3:29:41.160]  uh slur slander uh criticize and it's us we probably take that account put on no fly list
[3:29:42.200 --> 3:29:48.920]  yeah put on a no fly list no reason given you're just a bad comrad who do i see about that well
[3:29:48.920 --> 3:29:53.480]  go look at that how about that guy in the blue jacket down there he doesn't know anything either
[3:29:53.480 --> 3:29:58.200]  you've just been you've just been put you know the mark of cane has been put on you and you're
[3:29:58.200 --> 3:30:06.040]  just increasingly going to be um be hammered so i i don't look for any help or solutions coming
[3:30:06.040 --> 3:30:12.280]  from the national level from uh from the republican party they're you know even the best of the
[3:30:12.280 --> 3:30:19.160]  senators you know the ted cruises the rand pauls they're in an arena like the roman coliseum
[3:30:19.160 --> 3:30:23.800]  where at you know they've got a little tiny trident and spear but they're surrounded by lions
[3:30:23.800 --> 3:30:29.560]  they really can't do change the game at all the the only thing that you can do is get away from
[3:30:29.560 --> 3:30:35.960]  the blue states get away from the blue cities and to this to the extent that politics is going to
[3:30:35.960 --> 3:30:42.760]  work at all you've got to support local politicians that are going to fight back and and not literally
[3:30:42.760 --> 3:30:49.800]  at like a state secession level like you know 1861 but the way that the way that governor ron
[3:30:49.800 --> 3:30:55.000]  disantis is doing it they're passing in florida we're passing a bill that's going to make
[3:30:55.640 --> 3:31:02.520]  any vaccine laws null and void any corporations that try to do vaccine mandatory vaccine laws
[3:31:02.520 --> 3:31:07.160]  those corporations aren't going to be able to do business in florida you know he's also taking
[3:31:07.160 --> 3:31:12.520]  on big tech you know with um penalties that at this point may be the you know the small
[3:31:12.520 --> 3:31:17.800]  change to the googles of the world but they're going to be penalized for banning conservatives
[3:31:17.800 --> 3:31:24.600]  you know and and down the line they're trying at a local level for example of it they have these
[3:31:24.600 --> 3:31:29.880]  anti riot laws that they're passing in florida where if you're trapped by people illegally
[3:31:29.880 --> 3:31:34.920]  blocking the streets and you feel you know threatened or endangered you don't have to
[3:31:34.920 --> 3:31:40.600]  just sit there and you know while while your car windshield is bashed out you can drive to safety
[3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:47.320]  so to the extent possible move away from the blue hives you know it's predictable it's going to be
[3:31:47.320 --> 3:31:54.120]  worse you know when this american breakup happens it's going to be much worse the closer you are to
[3:31:54.120 --> 3:32:00.600]  the big blue hives what i call the democrat vote harvesting plantations that's the only thing that
[3:32:00.600 --> 3:32:05.320]  those cities are good for now that's why they're bringing in the illegals they're just trying to
[3:32:05.320 --> 3:32:12.040]  change the demographics import more welfare votes that is the democrat game and they're completely
[3:32:12.040 --> 3:32:18.440]  going for broke like alex has been saying this is not a dress rehearsal this is not like let's see
[3:32:18.440 --> 3:32:24.280]  how far we can go but have a plan b just in case it looks like the republicans are going to win in
[3:32:24.280 --> 3:32:32.840]  2022 the democrats are pulling out the stops they are acting as if the 2022 election is either never
[3:32:32.840 --> 3:32:38.840]  going to happen or if it happens it's going to be totally rigged by then so it won't matter
[3:32:38.840 --> 3:32:43.640]  so if you're just hoping for a political bailout i think that's a lost hope and
[3:32:43.640 --> 3:32:49.320]  i'm going to continue this on the segment on the other side because it's going to get bad folks real
[3:32:49.320 --> 3:33:09.960]  bad the answer to 1984 is 1776 info wars has been banned arrested
[3:33:09.960 --> 3:33:21.160]  attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here
[3:33:21.160 --> 3:33:31.800]  go to band dot video download the videos and share support the information war at infowarstore.com
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:40.600]  and never give up the fight

[3:33:54.520 --> 3:33:59.720]  collapses the third world dies we have such a complex civilization with so many billions of
[3:33:59.720 --> 3:34:05.560]  moving parts that when you shut down the first world it causes a chain reaction that will
[3:34:05.560 --> 3:34:10.200]  devastate the third world and really hurt the first world well now you're hearing about gas
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:14.920]  shortages all over the united states that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers
[3:34:14.920 --> 3:34:19.240]  that could barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down plus the
[3:34:19.240 --> 3:34:24.280]  keystone pipeline's been shut down along with other pipelines the left is now blowing up dams
[3:34:24.280 --> 3:34:29.640]  across the u.s. we're being shut down our coal power plants are off as well ladies and gentlemen
[3:34:29.640 --> 3:34:34.360]  prepare to be a total slave the third world is imploding as well the borders have been removed
[3:34:34.360 --> 3:34:39.400]  until you wake up this is a globalist chai com takeover great reset you have no hope they're
[3:34:39.400 --> 3:34:45.160]  announcing that there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer so they told you that
[3:34:45.160 --> 3:34:48.600]  you're under lockdown one way or another and cnn laughed at you and your family
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:54.760]  ha ha ha last week i had a caller to my radio slash tv transmission
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:34:59.560]  and he said to me he said alex there's all these facts all these numbers of vaccines
[3:34:59.560 --> 3:35:04.280]  being recalled and people dying from it and people getting sick how do i reach out to my

[3:36:00.680 --> 3:36:04.520]  mean that they don't have power just like the southern prairie law center that's just as bad
[3:36:04.520 --> 3:36:08.840]  they represent the globalist the big power structure that wants authoritarianism and
[3:36:08.840 --> 3:36:13.400]  back's common as china and its death camps and they back bringing those similar systems here to
[3:36:13.400 --> 3:36:19.720]  america and they've even officially called the adl for my arrest for my speech and for mark zuckerberg
[3:36:19.720 --> 3:36:24.760]  to be arrested for free speech as well these are very very dangerous times they don't want us to be

[3:36:46.440 --> 3:37:10.280]  the tyrants want you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:37:24.200 --> 3:37:31.400]  you know that you can get my um you can get my novels from anazon unfortunately they are the big
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:37.640]  gorilla but you can also get them for me if you look at my website you can find out how to get them
[3:37:37.640 --> 3:37:45.800]  and i'll sign them whereas jeff bezos he probably won't not that you'd want his signature something
[3:37:45.800 --> 3:37:53.160]  that that um people who have survived these these social cataclysms they all say the same thing you
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:59.480]  can't have enough food whether it's venezuela today or or the balkans during the nineties
[3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:05.400]  people think that this will just be over in a few weeks and and uh you know just a couple
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:10.360]  extra meals tucked away here and there and i'll be able to get through it this is not true you're
[3:38:10.360 --> 3:38:16.920]  going to need a lot more food than you think so laying away the uh you know the products from
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:24.440]  the infowars stores is going to be very important and and not only that water filtration very important
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:31.960]  there are going to be times when when uh the the water system breaks down this is also very predictable
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:37.960]  when your local water system breaks down it doesn't mean it's just shut like you have it could but i
[3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:43.720]  mean generally it doesn't mean you've seen your last shower and that's it until you know the end of
[3:38:43.720 --> 3:38:50.520]  uh the end of time what's very common you'll be put on water hours or there will be periods where
[3:38:51.080 --> 3:38:57.480]  there's some strife or conflict happening upstream and for a while the water system is down until
[3:38:57.480 --> 3:39:03.080]  your favorite warlords take over again and get it running again but there will be a period where
[3:39:03.080 --> 3:39:09.960]  there's brown crud coming out of the tap not the beautiful sparkling fluoridated water that we
[3:39:09.960 --> 3:39:16.200]  americans are so privileged to enjoy kind of sarcastic there don't take me the wrong way
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:22.760]  but i mean the the safe drinking water you're used to might not be available 24 seven you might be
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:28.920]  filling bathtubs during that hour or two when the water comes on and it's going to be nasty
[3:39:28.920 --> 3:39:34.680]  you're going to need water filtration very important to get a water filtration system now
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:41.720]  just because the water is running from your tap it's not necessarily going to be safe the the
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:46.440]  water the water power authorities they're not going to have the kind of chemicals and filters
[3:39:46.440 --> 3:39:51.880]  available they'll just be putting water through and saying you know hey we can't assure you that it's
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:58.680]  safe do your best boil it if you have electricity or gas to heat it with everybody's going to be
[3:39:58.680 --> 3:40:04.600]  out of the the same chemicals at the big level and at the small level we're seeing it now not
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:10.440]  just with food supply getting you know getting problematic if you look at at home depot what's
[3:40:10.440 --> 3:40:16.360]  going on with lumber lumber is used in almost every kind of home construction so just as the
[3:40:16.360 --> 3:40:23.000]  economy starts to take off with the end of lockdowns and housing is starting to take off
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:28.680]  all the sudden prices are going to be doubling because the price of lumber is just going through
[3:40:28.680 --> 3:40:34.280]  the roof you know and not just lumber so you're seeing it in these in these um uh
[3:40:35.480 --> 3:40:40.760]  you know early simple supply chain things but eventually it's going to be food on the shelf
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:47.400]  so I can't emphasize enough you're going to need not only you know to protect yourself physically
[3:40:47.400 --> 3:40:52.440]  but you're going to need to be able to purify your water and have enough food to get through
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:40:56.840]  these hard times you will not have enough food no matter how much you buy you're going to wish
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:06.520]  you had more okay now in the I would just like to say about where we're going is not a dry run
[3:41:06.520 --> 3:41:13.160]  this is not a dress rehearsal the American Bolsheviks are completely going for broke this time
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:18.920]  they have not only are crossing the Rubicon they are blowing up the bridge behind them
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:26.520]  they are acting as if there is no chance of a republican comeback you know this and
[3:41:26.520 --> 3:41:32.520]  some other indications of this are pushing the vaccines on the children this is an
[3:41:32.520 --> 3:41:41.160]  experimental vaccine not fully tested only put it put out under an emergency use use authorization
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:48.040]  when when there are bad consequences coming in the next couple of years if they were worried
[3:41:48.040 --> 3:41:53.640]  about the republicans taking over they would understand there could be trials there could be
[3:41:53.640 --> 3:42:01.480]  you know the worst consequences for the people that pushed this this vaccine across the population
[3:42:01.480 --> 3:42:07.000]  including the children the fact that they're not worried about this tells me that they have blown
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:14.200]  up the bridge they are going ahead come hell or high water another indication of this is the coming
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:23.400]  hyperinflation they're not stupid they know printing or digitally printing 11 trillion
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:31.720]  dollars you know 11 million million dollars is never going to work nobody's going to buy our
[3:42:31.720 --> 3:42:38.760]  bonds the american dollar is has completely lost its value as the world's reserve currency it's
[3:42:38.760 --> 3:42:45.480]  going to be no different than than a venezuelan peso or a german weimar reich you know deutsmark
[3:42:46.040 --> 3:42:52.600]  completely worthless so they're knowingly blowing up the economic system and like the
[3:42:52.600 --> 3:42:59.960]  bolsheviks before them they have an out for this they're they have a group of scapegoats they're
[3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:06.120]  going to blame so they're going to blow up the economic system intentionally and then they're
[3:43:06.120 --> 3:43:13.560]  going to turn and blame it on the conservative white extremists who just wouldn't get with the
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:21.000]  program you know who just refused to see the advantages of globalist socialism and we're
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:27.160]  doing everything they could to hinder and and sabotage the progress this is what's this is
[3:43:27.160 --> 3:43:35.320]  what's happening one one description for this is anarcho tyranny you blow up a society and then
[3:43:35.320 --> 3:43:42.120]  you blame a scapegoat you have an excuse to turn the country into a police state meanwhile
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:49.160]  you're purging the police of honorable veterans they're getting out because they see nobody's got
[3:43:49.160 --> 3:43:55.320]  their back they're quitting in droves do you really think there are going to be no police no
[3:43:55.320 --> 3:44:01.560]  there the police are going to be like the thugs that you see in the movie clockwork orange the
[3:44:01.560 --> 3:44:08.040]  former gangbanger criminals are going to be given badges and they're going to be they're going to
[3:44:08.040 --> 3:44:16.040]  know who the enemy is so don't be surprised next year when you see former antifa and blm thugs
[3:44:16.040 --> 3:44:23.720]  wearing a badge and you know who their enemy is going to be it's you this is coming they're
[3:44:23.720 --> 3:44:31.320]  also doing the same exact thing in the military they're purging the military they're fast tracking
[3:44:31.880 --> 3:44:40.920]  woke minority sexual minorities as well they're fast tracking anybody with a grudge against
[3:44:40.920 --> 3:44:48.040]  america they're they're telling patriots get the hell out we don't want you you're a white extremist
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:54.200]  well the message is being heard loud and clear at the top level of the military the generals who
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:44:59.880]  don't go along with this are just shutting their mouth keeping their head down and counting the
[3:44:59.880 --> 3:45:06.120]  days until they can retire and collect their pension there's no courage among them there's
[3:45:06.120 --> 3:45:13.560]  nobody standing up now in france we are seeing a little glimmer of hope where a retired general of
[3:45:13.560 --> 3:45:20.120]  a retired french foreign legion paratroop general had about a hundred other senior officers sign a
[3:45:20.120 --> 3:45:26.200]  letter saying that france was being destroyed and they weren't just going to sit by calmly
[3:45:26.200 --> 3:45:33.320]  and watch france destroyed by this globalist push we need to see something like that in america
[3:45:33.320 --> 3:45:40.600]  because the country we love it's just being wrecked intentionally and and you can just see it coming
[3:45:40.600 --> 3:45:47.080]  in front of you now owens going to be coming on at the top of the hour and i can't wait to see the
[3:45:47.080 --> 3:45:53.880]  show he's always ready he's always loaded for bear and like alex said he's the greatest asset
[3:45:53.880 --> 3:46:00.200]  outside of alex i think that info wars has to go ahead take it away thank you for those kind
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:05.240]  words and you know matt i think anybody who's serious about what we're dealing with right now
[3:46:05.240 --> 3:46:10.680]  knows that yeah food emergency food supplies you know precious metals if you want to try
[3:46:10.680 --> 3:46:15.640]  to protect whatever savings you have that's not tied up in assets i mean that's how real it is
[3:46:15.640 --> 3:46:20.600]  it's sad that this is what we have to think about in america it's sad that this is what we have to
[3:46:20.600 --> 3:46:25.080]  do to get prepared in the united states of america but this is the reality of the situation
[3:46:25.080 --> 3:46:29.880]  and last night's biden what they're calling a joint address who's really a state of the union
[3:46:29.880 --> 3:46:35.080]  they just decided to change the name of it matt so that was obviously strategic maybe that's why
[3:46:35.080 --> 3:46:40.840]  barely 10 million people even watched on television the lowest rated state of the union in modern
[3:46:40.840 --> 3:46:45.880]  history and maybe that's why nobody was tuning in on the internet later either this is the man
[3:46:45.880 --> 3:46:50.760]  that allegedly received 81 million votes but i guess when you think about it matt when they
[3:46:50.760 --> 3:46:56.040]  steal an election in broad daylight i guess this is what follows right i mean this is the totalitarianism
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:47:01.640]  that follows inevitably throughout history so i'm going to be covering that and we're also
[3:47:01.640 --> 3:47:07.240]  loaded with guests joe hoff on the election audit uh tom pappard as a breaking news story he's going
[3:47:07.240 --> 3:47:11.640]  to have for us that's going to be coming up on national file and then norm paddus constitutional
[3:47:11.640 --> 3:47:15.560]  expert is going to talk about the indefinite detention of trump supporters that's happening
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:22.360]  right now what a shame and you know they're not hiding it when they're not hiding it that tells
[3:47:22.360 --> 3:47:28.280]  you everything you need to know you know for for example mary mccord the x department of justice
[3:47:28.280 --> 3:47:33.640]  head of the national security division she's now gone to the faiza court this is literally
[3:47:33.640 --> 3:47:52.120]  announcing that the fox is guarding the henhouse they're not hiding it
