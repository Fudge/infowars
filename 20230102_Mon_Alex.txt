[00:00.000 --> 00:28.200]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is the Alex Jones show.
[00:28.200 --> 00:35.880]  It is infowars.com, live on air in the year 2023.
[00:35.880 --> 00:39.160]  So why don't you suck on that globalists?
[00:39.160 --> 00:43.880]  Why don't you suck on that deep state 2023?
[00:43.880 --> 00:50.480]  Another year on air, another year of victory, another year where we refuse to give up.
[00:50.480 --> 00:56.800]  We refuse to back down and we refuse to be slaves in a corporate world government leading
[00:56.800 --> 01:05.560]  the charge against it is us, you, me, the crew, Alex Jones, the great guests, everybody.
[01:05.560 --> 01:08.240]  That's why we are here.
[01:08.240 --> 01:12.680]  And even though I don't get too hyped about the flipping of the calendar, another sunrise,
[01:12.680 --> 01:17.200]  another sunset, it does represent new potential.
[01:17.200 --> 01:27.720]  It does represent new beginnings and it offers sometimes hope in times of treachery.
[01:27.720 --> 01:33.720]  And isn't that what we've been going through all the treacherous treatment by our government?
[01:33.720 --> 01:40.400]  Now let me just say, as a quick programming note here, we have an absolutely loaded transmission.
[01:40.400 --> 01:46.120]  Now Alex Jones is joining us on the other side of this break.
[01:46.120 --> 01:52.040]  It is after all the Alex Jones show and we will be hearing a message from Alex on the
[01:52.040 --> 02:01.480]  other side of this break and throughout the day, specifically a New Year's themed message.
[02:01.480 --> 02:09.240]  Because after all, do you think the deep state, the globalists, the Democrats, the national
[02:09.240 --> 02:16.760]  crime syndicate with big tech and the Democrat party, do you think they had infowars still
[02:16.760 --> 02:21.520]  being on the air as part of their problems to deal with in the year 2023?
[02:21.520 --> 02:25.320]  No, I think they thought we'd be shut down a long time ago.
[02:25.320 --> 02:32.520]  But thanks to you in the audience, thanks to God above, we are still here.
[02:32.520 --> 02:38.560]  Now having said that, we are going to be covering a ton of news today.
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.720]  I mean, there is just so much news today that I'm going to be here for seven hours covering
[02:43.720 --> 02:47.680]  all of it and I will not be short of news to cover.
[02:47.680 --> 02:52.000]  I will be able to fill seven hours easily and of course the great jailed Salente is
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.880]  going to be joining us as well.
[02:53.880 --> 02:55.840]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[02:55.840 --> 03:01.560]  We have an in studio guest today and that is Jeff Younger and we've been following the
[03:01.560 --> 03:11.960]  story here in Texas for years now where the Texas Supreme Court is basically saying you
[03:11.960 --> 03:14.600]  cannot protect your son.
[03:14.600 --> 03:24.680]  It could be a daughter, but you cannot protect your child from the trans kid agenda and you
[03:24.680 --> 03:35.280]  cannot take control of your child's life when they're still young so that they can't be
[03:35.280 --> 03:44.280]  forced into chemically altering them with hormone therapies or even physically altering
[03:44.280 --> 03:49.040]  them with the trans kids surgeries.
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.440]  Now Jeff is going to be in studio at one o'clock explaining the recent Texas Supreme Court
[03:54.440 --> 04:04.680]  decision, but you wonder does the idea of trans kids make it through another year?
[04:04.680 --> 04:06.360]  Is that absolute insanity?
[04:06.360 --> 04:13.520]  Is that absolute madness make it through another calendar year or is 2023 the year we finally
[04:13.520 --> 04:20.400]  start to swing the pendulum back to common sense and its trans kids is recognized for
[04:20.400 --> 04:21.400]  what it is.
[04:21.400 --> 04:29.840]  It's child abuse and it's the complete mutilation is what it is.
[04:29.840 --> 04:36.280]  It's not trans kids, it's child abuse, it's genital mutilation of kids.
[04:36.280 --> 04:41.360]  Does that make it through another calendar year, that absolute insanity?
[04:41.360 --> 04:48.520]  So that's all coming up, but on the other side it's Alex Jones first New Year's message
[04:48.520 --> 04:54.640]  to the InfoWars audience and then all the news, all the guests as we hear at InfoWars
[04:54.640 --> 04:57.720]  kick off what is said to be another epic year.
[04:57.720 --> 05:04.760]  You want to beat the New World Order, you want to stop their globalist agenda, well
[05:04.760 --> 05:10.000]  so do I and I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.600]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.

[05:56.920 --> 06:23.760]  the action.
[06:23.760 --> 06:28.120]  Welcome to the year 2023, an absolutely critical time for humanity.
[06:28.120 --> 06:34.680]  We are at a juncture and we are deciding the future course of our species right now.
[06:34.680 --> 06:38.960]  Last year was an incredibly dangerous year obviously with the war starting in Ukraine
[06:38.960 --> 06:45.000]  and the global economy beginning to collapse but it was also a very powerful year for humanity's
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.640]  understanding of the way the world really works and the mass awakening and of course
[06:48.640 --> 06:53.360]  I'm talking about the fact that all of us that refused the shot all of us that pointed
[06:53.360 --> 06:57.840]  out that in a taxed immune system all of us that showed the scientific evidence that was
[06:57.840 --> 07:04.440]  connected to microcarditis and blood clots have been totally vindicated and now even
[07:04.440 --> 07:09.560]  members of the CDC and NIH and others are coming out being forced to admit that.
[07:09.560 --> 07:15.440]  Now the sad part about that is they are still moving forward attempting to give these shots
[07:15.440 --> 07:19.360]  to six month olds and up they're trying to make a mandatory in school they're trying
[07:19.360 --> 07:23.600]  to make everybody that visits the United States take the shots before they can get here we're
[07:23.600 --> 07:27.120]  the only country in the world now still doing that we're the only country in the world that
[07:27.120 --> 07:31.840]  gives these shots to six month olds and up and they're also trying to give it now to
[07:31.840 --> 07:32.840]  newborns.
[07:32.840 --> 07:37.400]  So we've got a lot of work ahead of us here when we deal with medical freedom and our
[07:37.400 --> 07:43.080]  bodily autonomy but regardless we had major breakthroughs and the whole enemy propaganda
[07:43.080 --> 07:48.960]  system and the federal control of big tech and everything they threw at us was not enough
[07:48.960 --> 07:53.000]  to suppress the truth from getting out and it's been our viewers and listeners that have
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.800]  been at the very very tip of the spear with that fight and it's been my broadcast to the
[07:56.800 --> 08:01.640]  grace of God was able to have some of these top scientists on first to magnify their voices
[08:01.640 --> 08:07.520]  so that now in the year 2023 we have a real chance of bringing these Joseph Mingola 2.0's
[08:07.520 --> 08:11.720]  like Anthony Fauci to justice through the court system with our criminal investigations that
[08:11.720 --> 08:16.560]  have now been launched in Florida the Germany's launching a criminal investigation and a lot
[08:16.560 --> 08:20.640]  more is happening so I just want to say I really appreciate all of you out there and
[08:20.640 --> 08:24.120]  the hard work you've done to tell the truth and I want to encourage you all to redouble
[08:24.120 --> 08:27.720]  your efforts so they're going to try to bring back more force injections more lockdowns
[08:27.720 --> 08:28.720]  and more.
[08:28.720 --> 08:32.720]  Again thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all at infowars.com tomorrow's news
[08:32.720 --> 08:33.720]  today.
[08:33.720 --> 08:45.520]  All right Alex Jones message entering 2023 humanity is winning we are winning but winning
[08:45.520 --> 08:53.160]  does come at a cost does it not and we'll discuss what that looks like today but let
[08:53.160 --> 08:56.280]  me just tell you what we have coming up as far as news coverage is concerned again we
[08:56.280 --> 09:01.600]  are expecting to hear more from Alex before the end of the transmission I've got a bunch
[09:01.600 --> 09:12.000]  of political news where it appears the narrative or the main plot that the media wants us talking
[09:12.000 --> 09:20.160]  about is and I think there is a general interest there obviously and that's this debate between
[09:20.160 --> 09:26.880]  Trump and DeSantis that's where I saw most of the focus over the holiday season and then
[09:26.880 --> 09:34.040]  leading into today's transmission Trump DeSantis Trump DeSantis you've got the Trump loyalists
[09:34.040 --> 09:41.080]  who I think are acting on their own I mean I don't know of Trump giving out any commands
[09:41.080 --> 09:46.680]  or operating any of these we'll call it internet hit teams to be going after DeSantis digging
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.480]  into his past digging into videos from 10 20 years ago saying see DeSantis is the bad
[09:52.480 --> 09:57.760]  guy you need to be supporting Trump I don't think Trump is orchestrating that but certainly
[09:57.760 --> 10:06.280]  that is the main thrust of the political debate right now when it should be what's about to
[10:06.280 --> 10:10.680]  happen with the speaker vote tomorrow.
[10:10.680 --> 10:15.920]  So I'm going to be discussing those two things the Trump DeSantis issue and then which to
[10:15.920 --> 10:22.800]  me is a non issue right now it shouldn't even be on the table it should be what is going
[10:22.800 --> 10:29.680]  to happen with the vote tomorrow for speaker of the house now that has gotten a little
[10:29.680 --> 10:34.800]  nasty behind the scenes I will tell you it has gotten nasty behind the scenes so I'll
[10:34.800 --> 10:42.160]  tell you what's going on with that so we'll have those political news stories covered
[10:42.160 --> 10:52.400]  today as well and I think what people are going to have to admit to themselves if they've
[10:52.400 --> 11:03.840]  still been in denial about it for all these years this idea this concept that somehow
[11:03.840 --> 11:13.760]  self government has failed and self government is something of the past a relic you can't
[11:13.760 --> 11:23.520]  be trusted you a pesky human you a little peon you a little surf you a little indentured
[11:23.520 --> 11:30.880]  servant you just you just can't handle the complexities of life anymore you can't handle
[11:30.880 --> 11:38.360]  the new technologies and so we need the government infrastructure built now so that oh well you're
[11:38.360 --> 11:42.160]  not even going to be driving a car in ten years and you're certainly not going to be
[11:42.160 --> 11:49.480]  traveling and people are starting to finally scratch their heads and say hey why with these
[11:49.480 --> 11:54.600]  omnibus spending bills and all these other legislative sessions why do they keep bringing
[11:54.600 --> 12:02.840]  up these concepts of this smart grid system the internet of things where now the government
[12:02.840 --> 12:06.920]  has control and they can turn my car off and now the government has control and they can
[12:06.920 --> 12:13.720]  turn my air conditioning or my heating off oh and you know where it goes from here don't
[12:13.720 --> 12:21.840]  you it's all smart now they can get on your phone they can control your phone they can
[12:21.840 --> 12:26.200]  control your thermostat they can control your car you know they have the new smart locks
[12:26.200 --> 12:31.120]  now to the lock on your house is a connected to the internet they can control that lock
[12:31.120 --> 12:34.720]  they need to send the feds in they don't even need to worry about bringing in a battering
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.960]  ram just hit the internet unlock button and then your doors unlocked oh they're coming
[12:39.960 --> 12:44.480]  right in and so people are seeing this and they're hearing it they're starting to see
[12:44.480 --> 12:52.600]  the bigger picture with the man-made climate change BS and they're saying well now wait
[12:52.600 --> 13:02.280]  a second I'm all for saving the planet I'm I want to be a good Samaritan to planet earth
[13:02.280 --> 13:12.040]  but now hold on a second I also want to be free and so these stories have been out there
[13:12.040 --> 13:19.200]  forever about the kill switch in the cars and there've probably been four or five bills
[13:19.200 --> 13:23.920]  passed that include the kill switch in the cars so they already have the legislation
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.800]  it's just a matter of bringing it to practice and they want to normalize it first they want
[13:28.800 --> 13:32.960]  to get you used to the idea they don't want you to hop in your car tomorrow have the government
[13:32.960 --> 13:38.320]  turn it off and then you're like what the heck slowly roll it out slowly introduce it
[13:38.320 --> 13:43.160]  it's kind of with the whole your engine automatically turns off and on now when you stop and start
[13:43.160 --> 13:49.440]  your car it's obnoxious it's just this idea that everything that's worked has to be changed
[13:49.440 --> 13:57.280]  so let's make it work not so well so that when we change it people aren't so upset so
[13:57.280 --> 14:06.960]  we'll be discussing that today I think the big story for 2023 though and I'm starting
[14:06.960 --> 14:14.360]  to see the signs of this coming fast coming fast it might take a month but I think the
[14:14.360 --> 14:22.640]  real story for 2023 is going to be economic collapse and devastation and people have been
[14:22.640 --> 14:29.600]  treading water financially for so long since COVID expecting some relief expecting things
[14:29.600 --> 14:35.280]  to get better no actually post COVID and post Biden the market really still has not corrected
[14:35.280 --> 14:44.640]  itself folks I think the market corrects itself in 2023 and if you thought it was bad in 2022
[14:44.640 --> 14:53.040]  I hate to tell you it's going to be a lot worse in 2023 it's going to be bad grocery
[14:53.040 --> 15:00.440]  bills energy bills gas prices and that that that'll be a story in and of itself that's
[15:00.440 --> 15:08.000]  not going to be what wallops you that's not going to be what wallops you and some of the
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.880]  luxuries that people have been used to being able to afford you're not going to be able
[15:12.880 --> 15:19.920]  to afford them anymore subscriptions memberships prices are going to go up you're going to cancel
[15:19.920 --> 15:30.120]  them and people are going to sit back and they're going to say what happened five years
[15:30.120 --> 15:37.640]  ago I was saving money five years ago I had a savings account that I could consistently
[15:37.640 --> 15:45.400]  put money into I was looking to buy assets houses cars making business investments that's
[15:45.400 --> 15:51.280]  all gone folks and if people think that's going to correct itself and be better in 2023 I'm
[15:51.280 --> 15:56.960]  sorry you've got another thing coming now I think 23 is going to be the year where people
[15:56.960 --> 16:02.520]  realize what's been done to us economically there is a war on for your mind your mind
[16:02.520 --> 16:09.040]  is a battlefield this is an information war info wars popularized those terms more than
[16:09.040 --> 16:15.400]  two decades ago and today whether it's Donald Trump or governor de santis or dr robert malone
[16:15.400 --> 16:20.880]  they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized because we understand the
[16:20.880 --> 16:25.120]  enemy's operations and we know how to beat them but we can't do it without funding and

[18:29.640 --> 18:35.880]  names. And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other

[19:16.120 --> 19:21.400]  rose hips should be your next purchase from the M4Wars store. The rose hips contained within are
[19:21.400 --> 19:27.800]  a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals
[19:27.800 --> 19:33.400]  found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteo
[19:33.400 --> 19:38.920]  arthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc
[19:38.920 --> 19:44.280]  themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense
[19:44.280 --> 19:49.160]  and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both is often
[19:49.160 --> 19:54.600]  inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to
[19:54.600 --> 20:02.760]  check it out at m4warstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie. Leading a frontal assault
[20:02.760 --> 20:18.680]  on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.680 --> 20:36.520]  We have not yet seen the post COVID post Biden market correction. I think we see it in 2023
[20:36.520 --> 20:44.200]  and people are in for a rude awakening. That's not to be pessimistic because America's been through
[20:44.200 --> 20:51.880]  worse financially, economically speaking. So we can recover from that. The challenge is going to be
[20:51.880 --> 20:59.320]  getting people to understand why the have nots or the haves and have nots have a greater divide
[20:59.320 --> 21:03.320]  between them. Why your grocery bill just keeps going up and up and up and up and up and up up.
[21:03.320 --> 21:07.800]  Why your energy bill keeps going up and up and up and up and up. That's in the story. I want to
[21:07.800 --> 21:15.800]  focus on some political news right now. The big debate, the big topic should be the speaker vote
[21:15.800 --> 21:23.400]  tomorrow and we're not getting enough of that. Instead, we're getting the typical Trump nominating
[21:23.400 --> 21:29.720]  the discussion and we're having the Trump to Santas debate. The Trump to Santas debate two years
[21:29.720 --> 21:38.200]  ahead of schedule. DeSantis hasn't even announced that he's running. I don't think, at least I
[21:38.200 --> 21:43.880]  don't have any direct knowledge of Trump launching this initiative for Trump's top loyalists to be
[21:43.880 --> 21:50.040]  going after Ron DeSantis so hardcore right now, but I don't really like it. I'll be honest with you.
[21:50.040 --> 21:55.640]  I don't like it because it's ahead of schedule and the real conversation we should be having is
[21:55.640 --> 22:02.520]  Kevin McCarthy or someone else for Speaker of the House and that vote is tomorrow. But here's some
[22:02.520 --> 22:09.480]  of the stuff. So like I said, it's the political commentary that is really dominating right now
[22:09.480 --> 22:14.600]  is Trump versus DeSantis. All the Trump loyalists are out telling you how bad DeSantis is with
[22:14.600 --> 22:20.440]  that, how bad he is with that and this and the other thing. Sharing video clips like an interview
[22:20.440 --> 22:27.080]  from like 10 years ago, DeSantis says that Bush was the most inspirational person you've met
[22:27.080 --> 22:33.400]  is like, look, see, oh DeSantis, he can't be trusted. He said he was inspired by Bush.
[22:33.400 --> 22:41.080]  He's doing an interview, a stand up interview. There was no planning for this. Someone just
[22:41.080 --> 22:45.320]  asked, oh, he doesn't know you can hear. He's like, oh boy, that's really tough to say. I don't know,
[22:45.320 --> 22:50.360]  but I mean, I didn't meet a President Bush, so I guess I'll say President Bush. It's like, oh, see,
[22:50.360 --> 22:57.400]  he can't be trusted. It's like, really? I mean, that's your barometer? Donald Trump who gave money
[22:57.400 --> 23:04.120]  to the Clintons? Donald Trump who was at events with Epstein and Maxwell? Again, I'm not, I don't
[23:04.120 --> 23:08.120]  sit here and say, oh, look, Donald Trump gave money to the Clintons. Look, Donald Trump was with
[23:08.120 --> 23:14.440]  Maxwell and Epstein. No, because it's ridiculous. I'm about policy. I'm about results. But oh,
[23:14.440 --> 23:19.320]  this, this hemming and hawing from the Trump loyalists just has me sick. Oh my gosh, DeSantis
[23:19.320 --> 23:27.480]  said he was inspired by Bush. Oh, oh, oh, that's, that's how purists you are now. Oh, I see Trump
[23:27.480 --> 23:33.400]  supporters are purists now. Okay. But that's neither here nor there. That's just the political
[23:33.400 --> 23:39.560]  commentary that I hope Trump is not unintentionally distracting from the real debate, which is who
[23:39.560 --> 23:43.720]  should be the Speaker of the House. I don't see this coming from Trump, but maybe it is Trump.
[23:43.720 --> 23:48.680]  Maybe a Trump is telling people go out and attack DeSantis, go out and help me do something for me.
[23:48.680 --> 23:54.280]  My campaign is dying before it's even off the ground. And to me, I see Trump reeling right now.
[23:54.280 --> 24:02.680]  I have to be honest. Trump, it wasn't my fault. Trump blames GOP's handling of abortion for midterm
[24:02.680 --> 24:07.560]  losses. To me, this is just Trump flailing. And I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's the
[24:07.560 --> 24:13.320]  social media censorship that has him upset because he doesn't get near the reaction or
[24:13.320 --> 24:20.520]  response from a truth social post than he did on Twitter. I don't know if he's just desperate for
[24:20.520 --> 24:26.520]  air and he's just dying for TV interviews or what. I just don't understand this at all.
[24:26.520 --> 24:29.560]  It just seems like he's flailing quite frankly from my perspective.
[24:31.240 --> 24:37.240]  But this is just ludicrous because Donald, you even know that this is not completely accurate.
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.120]  Here was the statement. It wasn't my fault that the Republicans didn't live up to expectations
[24:42.120 --> 24:49.480]  in the midterms. It was the abortion issue poorly handled by many Republicans, especially
[24:49.480 --> 24:56.040]  those that firmly insisted on no exceptions, even in the case of rape, incest, or life of the mother
[24:56.040 --> 25:02.040]  that lost large numbers of voters. Why is he even offering this commentary right now? Again,
[25:02.040 --> 25:07.480]  to me, it's just a guy flailing, desperate for attention almost. The people that pushed so hard
[25:07.480 --> 25:13.000]  for decades against abortion got their wish from the U.S. Supreme Court and then just plain
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.400]  disappeared not to be seen again plus Mitch McConnell stupid money. No, see, Trump, that's
[25:17.400 --> 25:26.600]  what it is. You got screwed by Mitch McConnell and we all know what happened in Maricopa County
[25:26.600 --> 25:32.200]  and we all know what happened in Georgia, not just in the last midterm elections, but in 2020
[25:32.200 --> 25:38.200]  as well. So to sit here now and say, oh, see, this is like the Republicans blaming you.
[25:39.160 --> 25:44.120]  This is like the Republicans blaming Trump for the 2022 midterm losses. That's like Trump blaming
[25:44.120 --> 25:52.520]  the abortion issue for the midterm loss. Both are inaccurate, wildly, but there it is. There's
[25:52.520 --> 25:59.080]  your Republican leadership flailing in the wind, flopping around, desperate, desperate for some
[25:59.080 --> 26:04.440]  sort of traction. And then the real debate, which is who should be the speaker of the house? Now,
[26:06.600 --> 26:12.760]  just moments ago, Dan Bishop, who's one of the good guys in Congress,
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.880]  puts this out. He says, why didn't we get Kevin McCarthy's proposed rules package at
[26:19.880 --> 26:28.120]  least 72 hours in advance? And so that has people concerned that the rules that Kevin McCarthy are
[26:28.120 --> 26:34.120]  going, that Kevin McCarthy is going to be enforcing if he becomes speaker of the house are not going
[26:34.120 --> 26:40.440]  to be what the, I don't know what you would call it, the Trump wing of the Republicans,
[26:40.440 --> 26:45.160]  the America first Republicans, the common sense Republicans, the non deep state Republicans,
[26:46.200 --> 26:55.240]  the anti establishment Republicans, they want to see those rules. McCarthy still lacks vote to win
[26:55.240 --> 27:00.360]  speakership. At least eight conservatives claim the house requires a radical departure of the
[27:00.360 --> 27:07.960]  status quo. Yeah, that's pretty accurate. But so this is getting a little nasty behind the scenes.
[27:07.960 --> 27:12.440]  I'm going to tell you, it's getting a little nasty. And I'm actually glad quite frankly,
[27:13.240 --> 27:18.360]  I'm glad that we have Republicans that are taking something that seriously finally,
[27:18.360 --> 27:25.160]  and understanding that we are in a life or death battle for the future of this country.
[27:29.320 --> 27:37.800]  So you have newt gingrich going on TV. And I like newt. But I got to disagree with them here.
[27:38.600 --> 27:43.640]  Calling those trying to stop McCarthy from becoming the speaker, Kamikaze's will sink
[27:43.640 --> 27:49.000]  the whole Republican party. Newt loses it over anti McCarthy holdouts. But see, I think that that is
[27:49.720 --> 27:53.480]  hyperbolic because the whole Republican party's already been sank.
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.400]  Sink the Republican party. It's at the bottom of the ocean, newt. What do you mean sink? How can I
[27:59.400 --> 28:04.760]  sink the Republican party? It's anchored to the bottom of the deep state. It's anchored to the
[28:04.760 --> 28:12.280]  bottom of the swamp. And I'm, I'm going to believe that Kevin McCarthy is going to be the one that
[28:12.280 --> 28:22.200]  lifts the Republican party out of the swamp. Is that a joke? Are you kidding me? No, no, no, no, no.
[28:24.120 --> 28:28.120]  Stopping McCarthy from becoming speaker of the house is not going to sink the Republican party.
[28:28.120 --> 28:34.200]  The Republican party has already been sunk by the likes of Mitch McConnell, who wants McCarthy to
[28:34.200 --> 28:41.000]  be the speaker. Incoming Republican Anna Paulina Luna says House member threatened her for not
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.920]  supporting McCarthy. I'm telling you, it's getting nasty. And I might know who this is. I'll tell you
[28:46.920 --> 28:53.640]  who I think it is coming up on the other side. But I got to tell you, if McCarthy gets the speaker
[28:53.640 --> 28:57.880]  of the house vote tomorrow, I am going to lose a lot of faith that we're going to see much change.
[28:59.880 --> 29:03.640]  You want to beat the new world order? You want to stop their globalist agenda? Well,
[29:03.640 --> 29:08.840]  so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist,

[29:13.240 --> 29:19.640]  I can't do it without your support. And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[29:20.200 --> 29:24.280]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to
[29:24.280 --> 29:29.160]  back down. And I'll never give up, but I could give out. So please keep me on the field. Keep me on

[32:59.560 --> 33:17.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.440 --> 33:27.240]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[33:27.240 --> 33:36.760]  so does he. Live from the Info Wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones and now your host Owen Troyer.
[33:38.120 --> 33:46.840]  Yeah, I'm very unmoved. I'm very uninspired by a 10-year-old video of Ron DeSantis talking
[33:46.840 --> 33:53.160]  about Bush, completely uninterested. It means nothing to me. Donald Trump flopping and flailing
[33:53.160 --> 34:00.680]  about saying, oh abortion is why we lost in the midterms. Give me a break. I'm more disgusted by
[34:00.680 --> 34:08.120]  that than I am of an old DeSantis video. Besides, folks, I've done this stuff before. You're at an
[34:08.120 --> 34:12.440]  event, whatever, you do a stand-up interview, it's off the cuff, you're not prepared, you say something,
[34:12.440 --> 34:17.800]  maybe you regret, maybe you didn't mean it. It happens. It's like this new documentary just came
[34:17.800 --> 34:24.360]  out from Andrew Calligan, I think is his name. I've met him before, he's a nice guy, but I wouldn't
[34:24.360 --> 34:30.680]  say he does gotcha interviews, but his interviewing style is a little off-putting at times and they
[34:30.680 --> 34:36.280]  did an interview of me and it made his new HBO film and people are like, wow, look what Troyer
[34:36.280 --> 34:41.800]  said here. He's like, oh, he doesn't look so smart. It's like, yeah, I had just had a 15-hour day
[34:41.800 --> 34:49.720]  and he comes up and asks me for an interview at one o'clock in the morning, but yeah, I'm a little
[34:49.720 --> 34:52.840]  out of it at that time. I mean, I was nice enough to give it to him. I thought he was nice enough
[34:52.840 --> 35:00.360]  to even ask, so okay. But that's my point is, no, I'm completely unmoved by Ron DeSantis saying he
[35:00.360 --> 35:05.480]  was inspired by George Bush 10 or 15 years ago, means nothing to me. No, I'm more upset that
[35:05.480 --> 35:09.240]  Donald Trump won't come out against the vaccines that have killed tens of thousands of people
[35:09.240 --> 35:15.560]  and he keeps telling you how great they are. That's more moving to me than an old stand-up
[35:15.560 --> 35:18.760]  interview off the cuff from Ron DeSantis. But let's get back to the debate because
[35:18.760 --> 35:25.480]  it shouldn't be about Trump and DeSantis. And quite frankly, if Trump thinks making the debate
[35:25.480 --> 35:32.440]  about him and DeSantis is helping him, he's wrong. The real debate should be who's going to be the
[35:32.440 --> 35:36.200]  Speaker of the House. Now, the problem is it's really only Matt Gaetz or Kevin McCarthy as far
[35:36.200 --> 35:42.920]  as I can tell. But who do you think Ana Paulina Luna, freshman Congresswoman in Florida is talking
[35:42.920 --> 35:48.520]  about when she says a House member threatened her for not supporting Kevin McCarthy? Now,
[35:48.520 --> 35:54.040]  I'm going to, I'm going to tell you an unpopular opinion here. But I bet it was Marjorie Taylor
[35:54.040 --> 36:01.960]  Green. I bet it was Marjorie Taylor Green. And let me be clear, I like Marjorie Taylor Green.
[36:01.960 --> 36:05.800]  I disagree with her on the Kevin McCarthy speakership, but I still like her. I still
[36:05.800 --> 36:09.320]  think she's one of the good guys. There's going to be people I like that are the good guys in
[36:09.320 --> 36:15.640]  Congress that I'm not going to agree with all the time on. And that's fine. Matt Gaetz, Americans
[36:15.640 --> 36:21.000]  want an honest and hardworking Speaker of the House, not Kevin McCarthy. Boy, I think that sums it up.
[36:23.480 --> 36:30.040]  I look at it as, why are we going to go with something that is a known loser?
[36:30.040 --> 36:41.880]  There's no, what is the potential from Kevin McCarthy? Oh, there is none. He's already had a
[36:41.880 --> 36:50.680]  position of leadership. He failed us. But that's the problem. If it's McDaniel, McConnell, and
[36:50.680 --> 37:00.600]  McCarthy for another two years, nothing will change for you politically with your representation,
[37:00.600 --> 37:06.680]  with your leadership in the Republican Party. Nothing will change. And that's the problem.
[37:09.720 --> 37:18.680]  So if I was a betting man, I'd bet you Kevin McCarthy becomes Speaker tomorrow. However,
[37:18.680 --> 37:27.000]  there is major nastiness behind the scenes. I don't think it's going to be smooth. I think the
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.480]  holdouts are going to continue to hold out and they're going to raise hell. And I hope that they do.
[37:35.400 --> 37:41.000]  Because the whole argument they're going to say is, well, now you're sabotaging McCarthy. Now you're
[37:41.000 --> 37:47.960]  sabotaging Republican leadership. What? McCarthy sabotaged himself. Republican leadership sabotaged
[37:47.960 --> 37:57.400]  us. Sabotaging Republican leadership. Oh, no, they've done so much for me. What will I do without
[37:57.400 --> 38:08.600]  the Republican leadership of Kevin McCarthy going to bat for me every day? So I don't expect anything
[38:08.600 --> 38:14.360]  to change there. And that'll be our first reminder of the deep state is still in control.
[38:14.360 --> 38:20.600]  When McCarthy becomes Speaker of the House tomorrow, but the holdouts are going to continue to hold
[38:20.600 --> 38:28.120]  out. I don't mind this rift in the Republican Party either because it has to happen. Either we're
[38:28.120 --> 38:34.680]  going to get representation from the people, for the people, by the people, or we're going to continue
[38:34.680 --> 38:41.240]  to get swamp creatures like McConnell and McCarthy. And I'm not interested in that. That does nothing
[38:41.240 --> 38:48.280]  for me. Oh, don't sabotage Republican leadership in the House. Well, it's not going to make any
[38:48.280 --> 38:57.640]  difference whether I do or don't. Except maybe if we do have a holdout, maybe if we do criticize
[38:57.640 --> 39:03.240]  the Republican leadership, maybe if we do make it a miserable ride for Kevin McCarthy, maybe then
[39:03.240 --> 39:09.160]  we could get some change here in the future. Maybe then we could have some leadership that
[39:09.160 --> 39:14.280]  actually reflects what we the voter and we the people want to see reflected in DC.
[39:17.320 --> 39:24.040]  I have no faith in Kevin McCarthy to restore that. Then there's Mitch McConnell. But there's no
[39:24.040 --> 39:30.600]  surprises here. In your face, Mitch McConnell to host Joe Biden at infrastructure bill celebration
[39:30.600 --> 39:38.920]  in Kentucky the day after GOP takes major House victory. So McConnell going to be rubbing elbows
[39:38.920 --> 39:45.640]  with Biden. That's nice to know. McConnell just wants you to know where he stands. And so Biden,
[39:45.640 --> 39:49.560]  I think, is still on vacation in the Bahamas. We'll have more news coming up on that later.
[39:50.200 --> 39:56.120]  He had the omnibus bill flown into the Bahamas, 1500 miles. He's saving climate change.
[39:56.120 --> 40:01.720]  He flew a bill 1500 miles to the Bahamas so he could sign it. The only thing missing was
[40:01.720 --> 40:09.720]  Sam Bankman freed. But don't worry, the money was laundered. $1.7 trillion signed by Biden supposedly
[40:09.720 --> 40:14.520]  in the Bahamas flown thousands of miles because he's fighting climate change.
[40:15.400 --> 40:18.440]  And he's never been to the southern border either. But he's going to be in Kentucky
[40:19.160 --> 40:23.240]  rubbing elbows with Mitch McConnell because Mitch McConnell just wants to piss on your face
[40:23.240 --> 40:28.520]  and let you know who he really stands for. And that's not you, the American people. That's Joe Biden
[40:28.520 --> 40:36.600]  and the Democrat Party. And then there is Joe Biden. Now, this is not a secret. This has been
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.560]  well known for years, but there's another book coming out about it. New book claims Joe Biden
[40:41.560 --> 40:48.520]  refuses to speak freely around his Secret Service agents because they're white southerners. Paranoid,
[40:48.520 --> 40:56.200]  they'll leak embarrassing information. Well, that's a nice funny shot at white southerners
[40:56.200 --> 41:02.040]  that I'm sure I have no doubt that he took, but it really has nothing to do with their
[41:02.040 --> 41:06.360]  skin color. It really has nothing to do with where they're from. And it has everything to do with
[41:06.360 --> 41:15.960]  the fact that Joe Biden is a disgusting creep and a corrupt politician. And it's been well known the
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.720]  disregard or disrespect or disgust even that Secret Service has felt for Biden
[41:21.720 --> 41:27.080]  after they had to cancel parties like birthday parties because the Bidens would show up and
[41:27.080 --> 41:32.200]  groped their wives and girlfriends. Yeah. So there's always been an issue with Secret Service
[41:32.920 --> 41:39.480]  and the Biden family. It's not exactly a all around good relationship.
[41:40.760 --> 41:47.240]  But I think really the concern is that the Secret Service probably knows better than anybody,
[41:47.240 --> 41:56.360]  the true state of Joe Biden, but they are loyal government employees. And I think we could probably
[41:56.360 --> 42:00.760]  all be grateful for that. I don't want the Secret Service to stand down just because they don't
[42:00.760 --> 42:07.080]  like the president. I want them to keep doing their job even if I can't stand the guy. And so they do,
[42:07.080 --> 42:17.480]  but you wonder if that damn isn't going to break. Don't you? Don't you wonder? Again,
[42:17.480 --> 42:23.000]  Secret Service workers may be the most loyal in the government, but you just wonder if something
[42:23.640 --> 42:29.880]  may give, especially if more details start to emerge about potential disrespect that Joe Biden
[42:29.880 --> 42:35.160]  might have towards Secret Service. Maybe one of them decides to give a little behind the scenes
[42:35.160 --> 42:43.800]  on what Joe Biden's life is like. I don't know, trips to the bathroom, the diapers, what happens
[42:43.800 --> 42:49.800]  at his beachfront property when he goes on vacation every weekend, all of the family members that are
[42:49.800 --> 42:55.720]  living at the White House. There's a lot that they can tell. And I don't think Joe and his family
[42:55.720 --> 42:59.640]  would like them telling it. Of course, they're not, but they could and that scares them.
[42:59.640 --> 43:05.480]  There is a war on for your mind. Your mind is a battlefield. This is an information war.
[43:06.200 --> 43:12.920]  Info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago. And today, whether it's Donald Trump
[43:12.920 --> 43:20.120]  or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized
[43:20.120 --> 43:25.000]  because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them. But we can't do it without
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.640]  funding. And we make it easy to fund with great products and power you and your immune system
[43:29.640 --> 43:33.880]  and your family as well. You can also make straight donations at info wars.com,
[43:33.880 --> 43:38.200]  clicking on the big red banner, a one time or recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[43:38.200 --> 43:42.040]  We're non violent. But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.760]  keep us on air, you are literally non violently politically punching the new world order in the
[43:46.760 --> 43:51.960]  nose, punching their lies in the nose. We are going to defeat the new world order. We're going
[43:51.960 --> 43:57.240]  over the top right now as a critical juncture. So please go to info war store.com and donate now,
[43:57.240 --> 44:03.560]  donate now, donate now, donate now. Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones,
[44:03.560 --> 44:08.760]  needs to support info wars and banned video. You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise
[44:08.760 --> 44:14.360]  you. I'm going to do that right now. Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry. You
[44:14.360 --> 44:19.400]  guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez,
[44:19.400 --> 44:24.440]  how many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones,
[44:24.440 --> 44:28.760]  including myself. I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because
[44:28.760 --> 44:33.400]  of this platform. And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't
[44:33.400 --> 44:38.600]  for Alex Jones. I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim cast the
[44:38.600 --> 44:45.560]  super Tim cast IRL. Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and banned video for granted
[44:45.560 --> 44:50.280]  because you don't know what you have until it's gone. We need to support free speech systems
[44:50.280 --> 44:54.920]  right now. So go check out the store, go support their store, go support info wars,
[44:54.920 --> 44:57.720]  leave a donation right now. Don't wait until they're gone.
[45:01.560 --> 45:08.200]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from nowhere
[45:08.920 --> 45:14.200]  to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world. We are engaging the
[45:14.200 --> 45:20.200]  globalist at point blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've
[45:20.200 --> 45:25.400]  persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for wars are the real reason you've
[45:25.400 --> 45:31.080]  had the success. We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order
[45:31.080 --> 45:38.680]  you've ever had. We are now entering the final mile of the marathon. And that's why today it's
[45:38.680 --> 45:43.160]  more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue the
[45:43.160 --> 45:49.240]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them. God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you.
[45:49.240 --> 45:54.120]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[45:54.120 --> 45:59.000]  great is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.

[47:58.040 --> 48:03.960]  the real red pill plus that is back in stock and 50% off right now at infowarstore.com. But
[48:03.960 --> 48:11.160]  I want to just tell you two supplements that were game changers for me over this holiday break.
[48:12.360 --> 48:20.440]  And one I have to tell you about is vitamin mineral fusion. Now I've got a canister right here on the
[48:20.440 --> 48:29.880]  desk and I can sit here and read from the label all the ingredients where you're getting more than
[48:29.880 --> 48:38.680]  100% your daily value of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12.
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.520]  You even got some vitamin K in there. I mean, it just goes on and on and on with all the great
[48:44.520 --> 48:50.280]  stuff, the magnesium. By the way, magnesium was like a top trend on Twitter today. People just
[48:50.280 --> 48:56.840]  figuring out finally how serious magnesium is to help with your immune system and so many other
[48:56.840 --> 49:02.360]  enzymatic functions. That's why we also sell fizzy magnesium. But why am I telling you about
[49:02.360 --> 49:08.520]  vitamin mineral fusion? Because there's a little bug going around Texas. A couple people on the
[49:08.520 --> 49:15.480]  crew got it. A couple friends of mine got it. And I happened to get it as well, of course,
[49:15.480 --> 49:20.040]  right over the holiday season. Luckily, I was already time off, so it didn't really interfere
[49:20.040 --> 49:27.080]  too much of the business workings around here. But I got it and it was pretty much in and out.
[49:28.120 --> 49:36.120]  And I didn't really get too sick, barely had a fever, a little achiness, a little fatigue. But
[49:36.120 --> 49:42.360]  48 hours, come and gone, wasn't that bad. And I think that's because my immune system was prepared
[49:43.320 --> 49:47.560]  because of all the supplements I take, quite frankly, from infowarstore.com, but specifically
[49:47.560 --> 49:53.640]  vitamin mineral fusion. And what I do is as soon as I feel something, like sometimes you can kind
[49:53.640 --> 49:58.200]  of feel something coming on, I double up on the vitamin mineral fusion, I double up on the supplements,
[49:58.200 --> 50:04.680]  and then I'm usually good to go. So it didn't hit me that bad. Little soreness, little achiness,
[50:04.680 --> 50:09.880]  a little fatigue, maybe a minor fever. But all things considered, about 48 hours,
[50:09.880 --> 50:15.880]  wasn't too stressful. Hell, I probably even would have come into work had I not already had the
[50:15.880 --> 50:22.680]  scheduled time off. But that's how you can deal with this stuff. And just to trace it back to
[50:22.680 --> 50:29.000]  COVID again, they want you unhealthy. They want your immune system depleted. So when you get hit
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.440]  with these viruses, they can cause you to live in fear and then control you. We want you to be
[50:34.440 --> 50:40.120]  empowered by having a healthy body. We want you to be empowered by having a strong immune system.
[50:40.120 --> 50:46.200]  That's why we sell supplements to do that at infowarstore.com. And then one other one,
[50:49.720 --> 50:57.480]  I went out on New Year's Eve, like I'm sure many of you did as well. And so didn't get the most
[50:57.480 --> 51:03.240]  sleep on New Year's Eve, we'll just say. So wanted to do some serious catching up last night.
[51:03.240 --> 51:10.200]  And it was probably right at or just after midnight, I took a swig from the down and
[51:10.200 --> 51:20.040]  out sleep support supplement at infowarstore.com. And man, let me tell you down and out. Good night.
[51:21.000 --> 51:26.520]  Man, did I have a good night sleep last night? And it was definitely thanks to down and out
[51:26.520 --> 51:33.080]  sleep support at infowarstore.com. And you know, it was so refreshing. The sleep was so
[51:33.080 --> 51:41.720]  deep last night when I woke up this morning, it was like no, no lethargic. Like I wasn't waiting
[51:41.720 --> 51:46.280]  to get the energy. It was like, I slept so well. It was like, boom, as soon as I got up ready to go.
[51:46.920 --> 51:50.680]  So I'm telling you for a good night's sleep, folks, down and out liquid sleep support,
[51:50.680 --> 51:56.440]  it's 25% off right now at infowarstore.com. So we made it into another calendar year.
[51:56.440 --> 52:02.200]  We hope to do it again. And your support at infowarstore.com will be paramount in
[52:02.200 --> 52:09.400]  accomplishing that goal. All right. Okay, let's get some of these other political news stories
[52:09.400 --> 52:16.200]  off the desk here. Democrat Senator Amy Klobuchar calls for regulations on social media companies
[52:16.200 --> 52:23.480]  for misinformation and disinformation. Of course, I'll translate that for you. Democrat Senator Amy
[52:23.480 --> 52:31.880]  Klobuchar calls for government control over the internet. And that's what it's really all about
[52:31.880 --> 52:38.440]  isn't it? And I will tell you this. And I'm going to be covering another story on the
[52:38.440 --> 52:45.560]  war room later today regarding this. I think the plan is already in place on how they're going
[52:45.560 --> 52:50.440]  to roll this out. They've already got their marketing plan ready to go. They've already got
[52:50.440 --> 52:55.560]  their celebrity voices and faces ready to go. They've already drummed up all the hatred against
[52:55.560 --> 52:59.400]  Elon Musk. They've already tried to normalize the internet censorship while denying they're
[52:59.400 --> 53:06.440]  engaged in it. Oh, we don't have a department of misinformation. And then while they lied, they did.
[53:09.080 --> 53:17.640]  So this is all about getting government control over the internet. And the practical application
[53:17.640 --> 53:22.760]  for your understanding is that there's not going to be free speech anymore on the internet. You're
[53:22.760 --> 53:28.920]  not going to be able to criticize a COVID vaccine. You're not going to be able to report on the
[53:28.920 --> 53:34.600]  origin story of COVID in a lab, which by the way, we've got more evidence on that. Anthony Fauci
[53:34.600 --> 53:42.360]  knew exactly what he was doing. Again, that's coming up later though. I do expect probably by
[53:42.360 --> 53:51.160]  this summer, if not the spring, you're going to see a full on rolled out plan on the Democrat
[53:51.160 --> 53:56.680]  party internet takeover. Of course, they'll use the guys of the federal government or the FBI or
[53:56.680 --> 54:00.280]  the White House, whatever it is. No, it's the Democrats and they're running the whole thing.
[54:00.280 --> 54:06.120]  We all know that. The agents of Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum, the agents of the
[54:06.120 --> 54:12.920]  Communist Chinese. And I would expect by summer for sure, if not by spring, you're going to see
[54:12.920 --> 54:17.800]  this rolled out. They're going to be doing hearings. They're going to have internet celebrities telling
[54:17.800 --> 54:24.600]  you why it needs to be like this. They're going to try to obfuscate the real story and they're
[54:24.600 --> 54:29.800]  going to say, well, what about internet bullying or what about leaking hacked materials and all
[54:29.800 --> 54:35.480]  this other stuff to distract so that you say, oh, yeah, that's a good thing when that's not what
[54:35.480 --> 54:40.680]  this is about at all. It's not what this is about at all. It's kind of like with the FBI
[54:42.520 --> 54:48.520]  wanting all this access to spy on you and getting it. And then you had the attack
[54:48.520 --> 54:55.240]  in New York City on New Year's Eve, a radical man running around with a machete. Oh, and what
[54:55.240 --> 55:02.120]  what happens? It turns out he was on an FBI wanted list and an FBI watch list as a known
[55:02.120 --> 55:09.080]  violent jihadist. And they let him go off and have the attack who injured three police officers
[55:09.640 --> 55:16.120]  because they're not using the power they've been given to stop criminals. They're going to use the
[55:16.120 --> 55:23.720]  power they're given to stop you. They want to use this power to spy on their enemies and
[55:23.720 --> 55:28.600]  politically destroy and censor their enemies. It's not about stopping crime. It's not building a
[55:28.600 --> 55:36.920]  stronger union. It's all about control for them. So I will tell you this, I again, expect to see
[55:36.920 --> 55:42.040]  something by the spring, definitely by the summer, the Democrats are going to roll out a whole,
[55:42.040 --> 55:48.360]  it's going to be a whole presentation and they're going to have internet celebrities and they're
[55:48.360 --> 55:57.400]  going to have it's going to be a huge marketing push. And of course, in the interim, they're going
[55:57.400 --> 56:04.760]  to try to devastate Twitter as much as possible between now and then, because they know that
[56:04.760 --> 56:12.680]  Twitter is going to be the only place that may not oblige by the new government regulations to
[56:12.680 --> 56:18.280]  have the government basically running the company and everybody else be hands off. And that's
[56:18.280 --> 56:22.360]  ultimately what did happen at Twitter. That's what was upsetting Jack Dorsey. That's what we're
[56:22.360 --> 56:27.160]  finding out in these Twitter files. So the government's already been running the operation.
[56:27.800 --> 56:31.480]  They just want to make it legal now and they just want to make it the precedent now.
[56:31.480 --> 56:39.880]  But get ready. Get ready for a major push for total state control over these social media
[56:39.880 --> 56:49.080]  companies by the end of this calendar year. And it's going to be not your normal political
[56:49.080 --> 56:54.120]  football that they're going to be tossing around and punting around. This is going to be like a
[56:54.120 --> 57:00.360]  Super Bowl halftime show level display wanting you to buy into it thinking it's so great when
[57:00.360 --> 57:06.040]  really it's just propaganda. And now people are realizing this with the out of us bill where it's
[57:06.040 --> 57:12.040]  like the fourth or fifth time they've done this big brother will watch you drive disgusting infrastructure
[57:12.040 --> 57:19.160]  bill installs kill switches in all new vehicles turns America into a police state. So this is what
[57:19.160 --> 57:25.160]  the government does. They say you can't start you can't make a new car unless it's electric.
[57:25.160 --> 57:31.480]  You can't make a new car unless it has the auto engine kill switch. It's kind of like how you
[57:31.480 --> 57:37.160]  already have your vehicles. Folks you understand that this is a plan. OK. You know why your vehicle
[57:37.160 --> 57:43.320]  has the automatic engine turn off when you stop your car. It's because ultimately it was going to
[57:43.320 --> 57:48.200]  be used for this. You don't think that was government pressure. Well now you know why they
[57:48.200 --> 57:55.320]  did it. You want to beat the new world order. You want to stop their globalist agenda. So do I. And I've been the most
[57:55.320 --> 58:00.600]  effective individual in the fight against the globalist and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[58:01.160 --> 58:07.480]  But ladies and gentlemen I can't do it without their support. And the good news is we're only under
[58:07.480 --> 58:12.520]  about two hundred thousand dollars a month. The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on
[58:12.520 --> 58:17.000]  every front but I'm not going to back down and I'll never give up but I could give out. So please
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.840]  keep me on the field. Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products

[58:56.040 --> 59:01.880]  the electromagnetics the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.

[59:48.280 --> 01:00:04.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:20.520]  You know I've got these clips and it's just every time Joe Biden speaks now this is why
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:27.160]  they have been hiding him he must be deteriorating fast because you don't really see much of him
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:33.080]  anymore you notice that you didn't see or hear much from Joe Biden in this last month have you
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.920]  that's because every time he speaks he either just says something that is just an outright lie
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.760]  that he just made up on the spot or he makes outrageous statements like claiming he was appointed
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:52.360]  to the Naval Academy in 1965 during a speech to graduates but it's just like I mean I could play
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:01:01.160]  these clips of Biden have no idea what he's saying all day long. Biden is not the real president
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:11.240]  who is running the show. Biden on vacation with his family in the Bahamas has the omnibus bill
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:25.880]  flown down so he can sign it to stop climate change oh okay I see I see but that's your president
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:34.600]  and of course the University of Delaware Biden graduated in 1965 so it's not possible for him
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:43.640]  to have been appointed there after he graduated it's Joe Biden he just lies on the spot is what he
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:51.000]  does now there's an interesting story here that I don't take too much out of but I think there's
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.560]  a story behind the story incoming Democrat congresswoman is married to DACA recipient
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:04.760]  who could face deportation if dream act doesn't pass so obviously we know where she's gonna stand
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:11.240]  on that bill now I don't really take too much of an issue here because
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.760]  I mean it's not like she got anything out of marrying a DACA recipient I don't know maybe
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:24.360]  she gets some free money or something so maybe there is something there but my point is this is
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:35.640]  how interests in politics works she has a direct interest in protecting DACA because she's married
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:43.240]  to a DACA recipient well that may be innocent enough but when you think about all the different
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:52.440]  loyalties that your politicians have none of them are to you none of them are to you
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:03:01.160]  they're too the highest bidder the biggest donor what will win them political favor in DC what will
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:09.560]  win them social favor in DC in New York and the east coast so okay you're married to a DACA
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:14.920]  recipient that's going to influence your vote no doubt maybe that's innocent enough but what about
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:21.640]  those that take money from big pharma and then promote the vaccine what about those that take
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:30.520]  money from planned parenthood and then promote abortion I mean that's how this works don't you
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:40.680]  know and I've got another story on that coming up later but so okay innocent enough you're married
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:48.360]  to a DACA recipient that's going to influence your vote but it's the loyalty that's the story
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:55.000]  here she's loyal to her husband she doesn't want to see him get deported certainly she's going to
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:02.760]  vote to protect DACA but what about a politician funded by I don't know a company like Pfizer maybe
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.080]  AstraZeneca Moderna what if what if they're getting money
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:17.560]  and then they promote a vaccine and well it comes out this vaccine is not really working as intended
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:23.720]  and is actually having negative consequences do you think they're going to come out and say so
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.680]  now or do you think they're going to continue to protect their own interests
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:41.080]  and their own donors so yeah okay a DACA recipient being married to one may influence your approach
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:49.000]  towards legislation and hearings regarding that that's innocent enough what about all the money
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.520]  these crooked politicians take from big pharma and big tech and Planned Parenthood that's the real
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:03.480]  story where do their loyalties lie there is a war on for your mind your mind is a battlefield
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:10.920]  this is an information war info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today

[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:23.080]  that info wars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them

[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:14.360]  broadcasting live from the un stronghold austin texas you're listening to the alex

[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:37.800]  you're not interested to hear gerald solente get the fourth hour today because i think
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:45.800]  we're about to experience a real market correction post covid post biden that we really haven't seen
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:54.280]  yet and america and its citizens in the world really have been treading water financially for
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:07:01.720]  years now and they've been thrown some some buoys and some some light vests by the government in
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:07.720]  different ways but that's all coming to an end and the expectation is that we're through it now
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:14.840]  things are going to get back to normal quite the contrary folks quite the contrary because
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:21.400]  here's the thing the supply chain never caught up the only the one the one good news is because
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:28.920]  biden botched up the gas deals so badly with saudi arabia and minnesota that we actually may get some
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:33.880]  some lower gas prices coming up at least lower than they have been because they accidentally
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:39.000]  double dipped and made deals with saudi arabia and minnesota in his complete incompetence and
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.760]  desperation but aside from that you're already seeing the interest rates go up oh wow the price
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.680]  of that the price of that house i've been looking at just went down by a hundred thousand dollars
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:57.560]  wow now's the time to buy then you get that interest rate hit and that price never actually went down
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:04.120]  did it oh sure the price you're going to make an offer with is certainly going to be lower but
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:09.000]  you're still going to pay that higher price just now in the interest rates but that's just one
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.720]  aspect so oh forget about forget about buying that asset now that you're going to need to take out
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:21.560]  a loan on because you're not going to want to pay those interest rates but then there's the supply
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:29.720]  chain issue the supply chain never got caught up it's still at a deficit if you would say
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:38.680]  where if you need here's an example i'm somebody that purchases electronic equipment and i have
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:46.440]  for years about five years ago really about 10 to five years ago in the electronics department
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:53.480]  let's say prices were going down dramatically you probably notice this tv prices computer prices
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:09:02.680]  laptops monitors all of the stuff just going down you could buy a nice big they got the 4k tvs now
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:10.440]  you could buy a nice big 4k smart tv 300 400 bucks be like 50 inches that same tv is now
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:16.920]  going to cost you 800 900 maybe even a thousand dollars why is that because the supply chain
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:23.240]  hasn't caught up they don't have the chips they don't have the manufacturing plus it's a volatile
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:29.640]  situation in china in taiwan and well the whole thing could go could put and then china could
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:36.440]  have come complete control over that which would only make it worse energy prices your energy prices
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:41.720]  are not going to go down they're going to go up and actually what's happening is
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:49.720]  the consumer price index has not caught up to the producer price index well that's going to
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:55.640]  happen in 2023 that's why you're going to see the higher grocery bills that's why everything
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:05.000]  is going to be more expensive and now because of these new green energy policies your energy
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.840]  bill is even going to go up higher because the government has forced the power company's hands
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:17.480]  into making a full scarcity of energy by saying you can't use coal or you can't use natural gas
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:22.440]  and then they have the power grid failure in texas and they say wow look at stupid texas
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:27.240]  look at the stupid republicans they can't even keep the power grid on no the democrats shut it down
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:33.320]  when you shut off the coal and the natural gas so you literally the democrats literally shut your
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:39.640]  power off they literally cut your supply and then they say ha ha you have no power supply you fools
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:48.200]  but it's going to be everything folks i'm telling you your membership to your country club to your
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:56.920]  gym to your subscription internet tv service streaming service it's all going up the market
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:03.720]  is finally going to correct itself except not the way people think everything is about to get more
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:12.520]  expensive biden economy biden wiped out 10 trillion dollars of americans wealth 2022
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:18.840]  saw worst bond and equity losses since 1871 yet now this is all going to start catching up
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:27.320]  up democrats to increase taxes in 2023 during highest inflation in 40 years and worst bond
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.840]  stock equity losses since 1871 they're going to increase the taxes because guess what i got
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:37.800]  news for you things are more expensive for the government too and they're not going to take
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:45.000]  a pay cut and they're not going to ramp down their spending no no no no no no they're just
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.600]  going to make you pay more so oh guess what consumer price index is going to go up again
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.840]  now your taxes are going to go up again oh
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:05.160]  but i thought we were through the worst of it no no no no no you're going to find the worst of it
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:13.400]  is ahead get ready for the rich session from wall street journal and i would translate this story to
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:20.200]  you the divide between the haves and the have nots is going to become more apparent than ever
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:27.560]  many people are just going to make a decision that we're just not going out to have a nice dinner
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:35.240]  anymore or you know i feel grateful i'm i feel fortunate i feel blessed where even though
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.680]  pretty much last year really for two years now you've been watching your
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.120]  grocery bills slowly go up for many you may have even seen it double
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.200]  and i feel blessed because i i go to the grocery store i see that my bill is double what it was
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.680]  four or five years ago but i say you know what i'm lucky i can still afford to get
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:02.520]  you know for juicy steaks from the grocery store where other people are going to say you know what
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:08.760]  i can't do the steak anymore i'm going to have to get fish or something else the divide between the
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:14.360]  haves and the have nots is going to increase and that's what the story is really about the rich
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:20.280]  session one third of world economy expected to be in recession in 2023 says imf chief
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:27.640]  it's all by design but don't worry they'll still be getting paid treasuries post biggest annual
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:39.320]  loss ever as inflation takes toll so the real the real pain i think from covid and biden has
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:45.080]  really not even hit yet i think i think that's going to be the story for 2023 everybody's expecting
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:52.040]  kind of these economic numbers where we really saw that was a big story for 2021 with the inflation
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:14:00.520]  the consumer price index the supply chain shortages i think that comes back in 2023
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.640]  because people are looking for a little breathing room and they're thinking things
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:12.920]  going to get more back to normal and it's actually going to do the exact opposite so
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:23.480]  now i'm curious to see if jerald salente agrees as he will be hosting the fourth hour today
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.400]  i think he'll be echoing something along those lines and and here's an example
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.760]  and this is a this is kind of it was already going that way but it's just it's just the
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:47.560]  perfect example of cutting tv's tough trajectory quarterly pay tv subscriber growth rate and so
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:15:02.760]  tv subscriptions dropped off six percent just a round number here six percent in 2022 now again
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:09.560]  it's been trending that way but people are needing to make cuts and one of the first
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:16.280]  things people cut in their budget is television or cable television especially these days it
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:23.240]  costs you an arm and a leg just to have cable tv internet every month so this is just going to

[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:06.760]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:13.560]  so
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:34.680]  anthony fauci is a liar and a crook now we have so much overwhelming evidence of this
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:43.240]  it's you're drowning in it and i've never seen this before but let's recall that anthony fauci
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:49.880]  has denied on multiple occasions knowing anything about gain of function research it's like a foreign
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:53.160]  language him he's never even heard a gain of function i don't even know what is what is that
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:58.920]  i've ever heard of that when asked about it by rand paul he just is in total denial he's just
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:06.680]  completely confused what it even means when asked about it but we are about to get the
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:13.720]  second round of fauci files released via twitter elon musk's uh announcement of that coming
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:20.520]  later this week but it's funny for a guy who claims to have no idea about gain of function
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:24.760]  research never heard of it doesn't even know what it is he's not involved in any of it
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:33.400]  that's strange coming from a guy here on january 29th 2018 talking about that exact thing
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:41.080]  anyway so let me just go on about nih lifts funding pause on gain of function research
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:46.280]  oh let me explain this a little pause it let's just reintroduce this clip for you
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:58.520]  with a little more context this dirt bag
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:03.720]  who do you like who do you like talking about anthony fauci more donald tropper ronda santis
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:15.880]  ronda santis says he wants to throw that elf off a bridge anyway so it was 2014 when this
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:21.000]  gain of function research that was highly questionable and scrutinized was shut down
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:32.040]  specifically at a lab in north carolina and it was made illegal and so fauci and obama just
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:39.800]  basically offshored it for lack of a better term and just sent the research to china and then
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:47.960]  china took it over with us government funding in a military lab well when this all came out
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:52.360]  anthony fauci said he's never heard of it he doesn't fund gain of function he's not he
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:23:00.440]  don't even know what gain of function is he has no idea but then again here he is talking about
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:09.880]  gain of function in 2018 anyway so let me just go on about nyh lifts funding pause on gain of
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:15.640]  function research let me explain this a little because whenever this comes out there's always
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:23.000]  the pushing back and forth from the press so like nyh now is going to do dangerous research no
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:30.200]  positive matter of fact oh oh there's always concerns when the nyh does this dangerous research
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:38.680]  and then what does it say right there on the screen on his own slide it says framework
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:47.240]  for guiding funding decisions about proposed research involving enhanced potential pandemic
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:53.960]  pathogens the very stuff he says he has no idea what it is he's never even heard a gain of function
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:24:00.520]  research here he is i mean folks this is again it's it's the austin power scene like uh i don't
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:05.400]  know what a sweetest penis and larger pump is and the guy's like here's your picture with it he's
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:10.600]  like i swear i don't know what a sweetest sweetest penis and larger pump is here's your receipt for
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:15.640]  it i don't i've never seen the sweetest penis and larger pump i don't know what it is here's a book
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:22.200]  you wrote about it it's just i don't know gain of function research oh really here's you bragging
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:27.400]  about it i've never even heard of gain of function research here's you doing a presentation on it
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:32.120]  we've never done gain of function research here's your signature on the funding
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:49.800]  ah ah but even on the thing it says potential pandemic pathogens and then the very pathogen
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:55.400]  they were working with is the pathogen that caused the pandemic and Fauci just says i've never even
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:03.080]  heard of this but we have the receipts fouchy i don't know what this is baby this sort of thing
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:11.880]  ate my bag baby one book anthony fouchy and gain of function research with covet 19 ah
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:19.480]  but let's go back to the slide i mean here he is in the slides in the presentation telling you
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:26.840]  about gain of function go ahead opposite so a framework has been now established to guide
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:35.160]  funding decisions on proposed research that might be anticipated to create transfer or use enhanced
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:41.000]  potential pandemic pathogens and he's literally talking about everybody has to have a neat little
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:50.200]  name to it this is called p3co so if you hear about p3co it's potential pandemic preparedness
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:58.760]  care and oversight now why is this convenient from everything else now pause it again oh how
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:06.360]  convenient look at a timeline of events here donald trump gets elected and then a month later
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:13.640]  anthony fouchy comes out and says trump will experience a pandemic when he's present boy
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:20.200]  how did fouchy predict that he must have a crystal ball no he has the viruses in a lab that he soups
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:25.240]  up and then releases to the world and then he brags about it so in 2017 fouchy says trump's
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:35.560]  going to experience a pandemic in 2018 fouchy releases funds to do research into pandemic pathogens
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:44.280]  in china funds it does the presentation shows you the slides and then boom in the election
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:51.960]  year 2020 here comes that pathogenic pandemic that fouchy said was going to happen but then
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:57.480]  denied he was involved in researching even though we have all the videos and the receipts
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:06.840]  with his face with his voice with his signature boy i'd say there is a reason to investigate
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:14.280]  anthony fouchy for being directly involved in the covet 19 pandemic but what does he do he gets
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:26.920]  awards for being such a good corrupt eugenicist in the u.s. government and he expects to just
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:33.160]  ride off into the sunset and he probably will because that's how corrupt our country is but
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:40.440]  there you go so again next time you hear anthony fouchy well i don't know i don't know i've never
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:44.600]  heard of gain a function i don't know anything about gain a function i certainly never funded
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:52.920]  any gain a function i don't even know what a gain a function is ah swedish made penis and
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:28:00.520]  larger pump baby i don't know anything about this baby it's not my bag baby it's not my bag baby
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:07.720]  gain a function reason i don't know any i've never even heard of this oh not my bag baby
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:18.600]  no it's it's it is your bag baby so what is the next round of twitter files on fouchy
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:25.480]  going to show us the fouchy files elon musk teaches release of bombshell fouchy files

[01:32:54.520 --> 01:33:01.320]  keep info wars alive because in the process you're keeping american liberty alive leading a frontal
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:20.680]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones you found it the tip of the spear
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:34.040]  it is the alex jones show with owen shroyer
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:48.120]  but i think it's fair to think that the story or the conclusion of anthony fowchee's career
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:57.400]  is going to be an indicator of whether or not we can actually have any hopes to clean up corruption
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:03.080]  government corruption specifically in this country because what fowchee did is so egregious so
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:13.160]  blatant so obvious and if we can't even get justice there it's gonna be hard to find hope
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:20.120]  that we can get justice anywhere with such an obvious case we'll see what comes of the
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.800]  next drop of fowchee files i suppose maybe elon musk is waiting for the next house to get sworn
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:34.680]  in hoping that the republicans there may actually have some interest in an investigation so i expect
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:39.400]  that to be the big news story perhaps wednesday thursday or even friday depending on when they
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:47.400]  decide to release that uh some other news here though in the in the health spectrum far left
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:53.240]  health advocacy group the people's cdc calls for continued mask mandates
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:03.400]  you see this is what the left does the totalitarian control freak left a far left group calling
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:10.280]  itself the people's cdc has called for more radical coronavirus policies like indefinite mask
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:16.600]  mandates and social distancing charging that america's relaxed pandemic policies stem from a
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:22.200]  here we go racist eugenics impulse behold into corporate interests
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:31.080]  i mean it's just it's just the reverse reality you know you need to do exactly what big pharmaceutical
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:36.360]  companies say and what big government says who's funded by the big pharmaceutical companies
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.360]  that's the people's cdc telling you that
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.360]  so okay
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:51.640]  behold into corporate interests that's forcing the vaccine on people
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:58.600]  you're now beholden by corporate interests claiming you're fighting corporate interests
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:02.760]  how do these people even you know their brains are broken
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:11.640]  their brains are broken liberalism is a mental disease we are the people's cdc
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:19.240]  and we're sick of corporate eugenics in big government and big pharma okay well what are
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:24.040]  you guys into we think we need more mask and vaccine mandates wait i thought you said you
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.440]  were against big government in big corporations telling us what to do we are so take your
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:38.520]  vaccine and wear your mask what that's your left but see it's all about control that's what it is
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:43.560]  they loved telling you to wear that mask they loved telling you to social distance they loved
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:49.560]  having that control over you they didn't mind this whole idea of cutting off your nose despite your
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:55.240]  face they like it they like living miserable lives they will suffer they will cut off their
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:37:02.520]  nose despite their own face as long as it spikes you too they're liberals kamala harris requiring
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:08.600]  covid tests for anyone over two years old to participate in senate swearing in photos that's
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:17.400]  so nice and loving of her yeah she's so open and caring imagine being such an arrogant bitch
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:24.040]  imagine thinking you are so much better than everyone else you can't you can't reach a level
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.440]  of uberus like that you can't reach a level of arrogance like kamala harris has reached
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.480]  very few can even reach it it's the obama level where after you finish taking hillary in the
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:37.960]  toilet you get on all four knees and go down into the toilet bowl with your nose and take a deep breath
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.920]  tell everyone how good it smells so you can't take a photo with kamala harris unless you get a
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:51.720]  covid test that is just despicable can't say i'm surprised modus mouse co-founder and drummer
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:38:00.600]  jeremiah green dead at 45 now here's here's the problem because anytime now where there's a sudden
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.480]  death or a celebrity dies people obviously question was the individual vaccinated now
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:12.360]  this individual had been diagnosed with cancer and so i was discussing this two weeks ago with some
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:19.160]  other stories where somebody takes the vaccine is told they have cancer a month or two later and
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.440]  then dies within two years from that cancer we know about the myocarditis we know about the
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:29.480]  heart attacks we know about the blood clots we know about the neurological problems cancer was
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:35.640]  also a side effect listed in the vaccine side effects a less prominent one obviously but it was
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:41.080]  there but we don't really talk about that do we so i don't know if that's the story with jeremiah
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:49.640]  green but it's a fair question i think to ask knowing that is another one of the side effects
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:54.520]  that they don't want you to know about and that they hid from the public while promoting this
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:02.200]  deadly vaccine california and new york now require all private insurance plans to fully
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:07.960]  cover abortion if they offer maternity care coverage now you understand that this is fascism right
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:15.080]  right and once you've seen how this all works with the with the money laundering that they do
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.240]  you don't even really have to it doesn't take much it's a it's as soon as you see it you know it
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:28.040]  so let me explain how this works this is the definition of fascism this is the definition
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:39.000]  of money laundry here's how it goes the government democrats and republicans take your taxpayer dollars
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.560]  so they tax you and they take that money and then what do they do they give it to planned parenthood
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:52.360]  i don't remember the guys see if you can find an annual number that planned parenthood gets
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:59.560]  from the government i think it's like 500 million a year or something probably more than that
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.400]  but see if you guys can find that annual number that planned parenthood receives from the federal
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:09.080]  government so the government takes your tax dollars gives it to planned parenthood and then
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:16.600]  planned parenthood turns around and gives it to the democrat party 99 percent of planned
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:21.240]  parenthood political donations have been to democrats and of course democrats are the ones
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:28.440]  promoting abortion so well of course planned parenthood is going to be funding the democrat
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:38.360]  party they're keeping planned parenthood in business talk about eugenics so the democrats tax you
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:44.680]  they give your tax dollars to planned parenthood then they receive political donations from planned
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:51.960]  parenthood see they have just stolen from you but planned parenthood is the middleman so there you
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:58.280]  go yeah uh uh just over 500 million a year annually from the government goes to planned
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:05.960]  parenthood so that's direct direct theft from you to planned parenthood back to the democrats
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:09.560]  you see how that cycle works because you can plug in the next search and pull it up
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:15.560]  99 percent of planned parenthood political donations go to democrats so the democrats
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:19.240]  take your tax dollars give them the planned parenthood and then planned parenthood gives
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:26.760]  them right back to the democrats and then they do the cycle every year the definition of fascism
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:33.800]  the definition of money laundering and it just happens year after year and they say well
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:42.920]  well this is if you just offer maternity care coverage well yeah you don't think insurance
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.600]  providers are offering maternity care coverage as if that's some sort of a special thing no
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:54.760]  all these private insurance companies now are going to be forced to cover abortion
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:05.080]  that's what this is about so it just all this does is keep the giant racketeering operation
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:09.480]  going you scratch my back i scratch yours that's how it works with planned parenthood and the
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:18.040]  democrats and meanwhile you're paying for the whole thing yeah they spent 45 million dollars in the
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:28.520]  2020 cycle uh towards democrats spent at planned parenthood to elect democrats so oh i see i see
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:37.240]  oh oh oh we're gonna make you we're gonna now write bills because abortion is not getting the money in
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:43.480]  like it used to so now we're gonna write bills democrats gonna write bills forcing insurance
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:49.000]  companies to fund planned parenthood where they're now having shortages because people aren't killing
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.840]  their babies anymore it's democrats don't they sound like a lovely group of people look there's

[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:38.120]  gut wrencher it's a real uh it's a real heart stopper at times so we'll be discussing that
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:47.400]  uh a couple other stories here today and you know guys i'm gonna send you something here
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:52.760]  quickly if you could print it for me before the end of the break because it ties into this january
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:52:01.320]  sixth news that uh i'm about to get into and it really just shows how trump was surrounded by
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:07.240]  a bunch of losers at the end of the day in his white house so hey i'll be critical of trump
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:10.920]  when he deserves it i'll defend trump when he deserves it trump was surrounded by losers
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:16.520]  and we're learning more about that now one uh girl in particular i'll explain but um
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:23.000]  if you guys can just print me that tweet whenever you get it radicalized times square attacker was
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.600]  on fbi watch list and so why didn't the fbi do anything about 19 year old trevor bickford
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:36.360]  who injured three police officers with a machete in times square who was on the fbi
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:41.080]  watch list as a radicalized potential threat to danger well because the fbi is not concerned
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:45.080]  about stopping dangerous individuals from harming people they're more concerned about doing the
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:51.160]  bidding of the republic excuse me of the democrat party and the january sixth committee going after
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:56.360]  trump supporters and all of the january sixth defendants that's their main goal that's their
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:00.760]  main agenda so yeah sure a terrorist gets out new york city stabs and people hurt some cops
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:05.880]  who cares they're going after innocent people that stood in the grass on january sixth suspect
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:11.000]  converted to jihadism before new year's eve machete attack on new york police department
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:22.440]  times square now if this story would have been in the news 10 years ago 20 years ago it would have
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:29.720]  been the number one story and it would have been all about islamic jihadism but because that's no
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:37.480]  longer the flavor of the month now the flavor of the month is right-wing radicalism they don't
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:47.160]  care about a story like this now i don't care whether the guy was islamic or a nazi skinhead
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:54.040]  or anything he's clearly a deranged lunatic went out to kill cops and the fbi maybe could have stopped
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:54:00.360]  it i mean you can have that debate of what can they do but we know what they're not doing and we
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:05.960]  know what they are doing and they're not stopping violent terrorists and they are arresting innocent
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:11.720]  men and women who had nothing to do with any violence on january sixth and then you deal with
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:20.680]  the ray epps craziness and this thing i you know i honestly i struggled to even report this to you
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:26.760]  to you because it's so insane it makes so little sense i don't even know how to present it to you
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:33.720]  in a way that does make sense so i'll just read the stories here pro trump protester ray epps
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:40.360]  pro trump protester ray epps isn't that convenient told january sixth committee crazy conspiracy
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:47.800]  theories tore apart his life and then in other stories i'm telling you it's so whacked out i
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:54.120]  don't even know how to explain it there's stories going on the internet right now that say
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:03.000]  how ray epps admits to his son that he's a federal provocateur
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:14.280]  that was aiding in the events of january sixth but then he says oh i had nothing to do with it
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:21.160]  it and i have nothing to do with the fbi and i didn't even know anything was happening that day
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:26.360]  really well then why are you in multiple videos saying you're going to go into the capital and
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:33.320]  and promoting to other people to do just that on january fifth and on january sixth how come
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:36.520]  you were on the fbi watch list and then taken off the fbi's list
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:45.240]  but see oh he can say on the record he helped orchestrate it
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:50.680]  and he was part of it and then he can go in front of the january sixth committee and say
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:53.560]  i had nothing to do with it i didn't even know anything was going on that day and they say
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:56:02.440]  yep that's what we're going to run with and then he says that his life has been torn apart by these
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:07.800]  crazy conspirators wait a second ray still to this day you're the only person i've ever seen
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:11.960]  in any videos encouraging people to go into the capital except maybe jaden x
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:19.640]  and but he actually did get arrested and charged i i don't know the latest with his account but
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:21.880]  you didn't he did
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:29.880]  oh but your life is being torn apart not the innocent people who have had
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:35.320]  hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal bills not people who've actually been arrested
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:41.160]  not innocent people who've been locked up and tortured there's a new book that's about to come out
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:47.800]  from a january sixth prisoner that's going to be highlighting the torment and the torture of their
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:55.720]  everyday lives but no it's ray epps who still walks free and can live his life he's the one that's
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:01.960]  being victimized by the january sixth scrutiny give me a break but here's the book i'm discussing
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.560]  january sixth book released first hand testimony of harrowing tragedy from the january sixthers
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:11.560]  living at the american gulag chronicles letters from prison
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:18.200]  so that's already out there but ray epps is the one that's suffering now
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:27.880]  i i wasn't even gonna cover this today but i'm out of time in this segment so i may just bury it
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:33.800]  but when you realize the type of people that trump had working for him you realize why
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:40.840]  everything went down the way it did and some of the latest comments that we've seen revealed in
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:48.920]  text messages from the likes of hope picks show me why there was never really any hope there is

[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:51.960]  receipts the total proof now and it'll become once again the same question of is anybody going to be
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:01:02.920]  punished for these massive crimes against humanity now quickly so whole picks who is probably hired
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:07.480]  because of her looks let's just call it what it is i'll be the controversial one to say it
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.240]  you know what it's fine people get hired for their looks all the time doesn't mean they're
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:16.920]  incompetent or can't do their job and good looking people get hired it's it's just a fact but
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:23.320]  but when you see some of these texts being revealed now you realize why donald trump's
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:30.360]  presidency was set for failure because he had a bunch of losers surrounding him
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:39.080]  and i'm going to try to explain this psychology here this is a text hope picks post january
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:47.880]  6 text revealed quote all of us who didn't have jobs lined up will be perpetually unemployed i'm
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:55.480]  so mad and upset we all look like domestic terrorists now this made us unemployable untouchable god
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:02:04.360]  i'm so f-ing mad so imagine here's hope picks who takes a job working for the greatest president
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:13.560]  in modern american history and she is upset because the lies told about donald trump and the lies told
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:20.680]  about trump supporters are going to negatively impact her oh poor hope oh i feel so sorry for
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:25.480]  you hope i mean i'm sure you but you are arrested for false claims right too yeah no you weren't
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:30.600]  oh and she's upset because now she looks like a domestic terrorist oh people are lying about you
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:39.080]  hope wow people are lying about hope and she's that upset her and she's mad because she didn't have a
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:44.840]  job lined up so she decided to throw trump under the bus hoping that she could have a job i guess
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:52.360]  hope doesn't have enough merit to get a job oh you're gonna be perpetually unemployed and so
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:56.360]  i'd do anything i'll throw trump under the bus i'll cooperate with the january 6 committee just
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:04.600]  anything to save myself we're unemployable no if you're unemployable you were unemployable before them
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:12.600]  but so she's mad not at the media that lies not at the democrats that lie not at the people that
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:19.800]  are actually trying to destroy her but instead the people that are on the same boat that her
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:25.800]  enemies are trying to sink and she's mad imagine you're on the titanic sinking and this woman is like
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:34.600]  what's gonna happen to me but what about me i don't even know how to swim i can't swim i don't
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:47.160]  have a life jacket pathetic pathetic so it shows you two things and i'm just i i'm not picking on
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:52.440]  whole pics here this is probably an example of many others is my guess that's why i'm using this
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:58.360]  as the example we just have all these text from her so it shows two things it shows that the people
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:03.800]  trump brought in really never had any idea what they were involved in totally clueless again this
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:09.480]  is a situation where they just wanted the prestige they wanted the access they they they wanted that
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:14.280]  for themselves whole pics didn't get in this because she cares about the country clearly she
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:21.320]  got in this because she cares about herself and my guess is this is just one example of dozens if
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:27.720]  not most of trump's appointees and cabinet members they didn't understand the fight they didn't want
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:33.160]  the fight and as soon as things got a little rough and tumble they throw their hands in the air and
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:42.680]  say i'm the victim what about me oh poor whole pics it must be so hard to be whole pics guys i
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:48.360]  can't even imagine it she's worried that she's gonna be perpetually unemployed and is unemployable
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:53.640]  but she's not mad at the people that caused all that no she's mad at donald trump and the trump
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:57.160]  supporters because she thinks throwing them under the bus maybe we'll get her another job
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:03.000]  you want to beat the new world order you want to stop their globalist agenda well so do i

[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:45.800]  and this story from texas should concern especially parents out there with how much
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:51.080]  say you have over your child's future texas supreme court rules against father seeking
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:57.480]  to prevent chemical castration of his son via gender bending hormones the supreme court of texas
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:03.560]  denied my mandamus effectively terminating my parental rights my children are now subject to
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:09.560]  being chemically castrated in california texas is an empire of child abuse led by texas judges
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:14.440]  the texas supreme court ruled against a father who petitioned to prevent his ex-wife from taking
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:19.080]  his seven-year-old son to california for hormone treatments that amount to chemical castration
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:27.240]  that father is james young excuse me jeff younger and he joins me now and so jeff just i know this
[02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:35.080]  has been a a years-long struggle for you and your family and so for a lot of new audience members
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:40.040]  they've probably heard about okay the trans kids you can take them to california and the doctors
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:44.680]  will chop them up there but they won't do it in texas but this has been a long backstory for you
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:50.200]  it's been a years it's been a year's struggle to get to this point lay out the backstory
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:55.240]  so that people get a better idea of what led to this decision and what it means so it's been eight
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:08:01.560]  solid years of litigation when my son turned two my ex-wife tried to transition to a girl
[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:05.480]  while i was still married to her and we were still living together and when i told her that she
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:11.400]  couldn't do that she filed for divorce forced me out of the house she's a pediatrician she used
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:17.880]  to practice in capel texas and she used a lot of her knowledge medical knowledge uh to get me
[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:23.640]  out of the house and away from my kids and at three years old i took the first iphone video
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:28.760]  i had ever taken and it was my son telling me that he thought he was a girl and i asked him why
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:34.440]  and he said well mommy's says i'm a girl and then i realized that she was cross dressing him
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:40.600]  she was telling him he had a girl's brain and a boy's body um that she had she had began to present
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:46.680]  him to the world as a girl and so forth and and to your understanding these were not original
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:52.600]  thoughts of your sons but coming from your wife at the time your ex-wife yeah i mean you know
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:58.040]  an 18 an 18 month old child two-year-old child just doesn't have any notion of these things they don't
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.280]  they don't think that they're uh they have a girl's brain that that's that's the type of thing a
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:09.080]  pediatrician would think um so what what happened was she began to really push this much harder
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:14.200]  till eventually she enrolled him in school as a girl in capel public schools he went to pinkerton
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:18.760]  elementary in capel texas people get real mad at me because i named names you know i'll learn that
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:23.800]  from alex name names tell people who these what's really going on in these places so you went to
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:29.160]  pinkerton elementary i would take him to school and boys clothes and this teacher would give him
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:33.000]  a dress to wear and change them into a dress and they'd make him use the girl's restroom and there
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:39.400]  was a period of time there up to about six years old where he was always a little unsure like because
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:45.400]  the teacher the principal the lunch lady the librarian the the police officer at school
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:50.600]  they were all telling him he was a girl and why was that because they decided to just go with the
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:56.920]  mom whatever the mom wanted so this was the mother basically getting in touch making communications
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:01.400]  with the school saying i need everybody to have my back here yes in fact that dress was given to
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:07.720]  the teacher by and georgias my son's mother so that he could be changed in it surreptitiously
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:12.440]  without my knowledge i found this out about a year later i filed grievances with the school the school
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:17.800]  found that that didn't that didn't um violate any of my parental rights amazing you know when
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:23.080]  you go through the school grievance process and so eventually this culminated into a big trial
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:29.480]  when my sons were eight and twenty nineteen and we brought in the world's experts from both sides
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:35.640]  of the issues and just so people know again though you had twins twins so twins um and
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:41.960]  your wife decided one of the twin boys she wanted to be a girl for whatever the reason was maybe
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:45.800]  she wish she had a daughter but that's how it went that's right and just to be clear also like
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:51.320]  she actually enrolled him into a gender clinic to be transitioned okay i had to stop that with
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:56.360]  the psychiatrist i talked to a panel of six psychiatrists and got that all stopped um she
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:03.080]  took him to a uh a married lesbian psychologist and she recommended that he go to another gender
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:08.440]  clinic for quote the medical side of treatment it's in his pediatric record and this is all from
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:14.520]  the ages of two to six two to six it's in his pediatric records that at five years old the
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:20.920]  pediatrician and my ex-wife were talking about chemically castrating him at age nine so this
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:26.520]  culminates in a trial um the top experts in the world on this issue come this little courtroom
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:33.720]  in dowes county um i deposed their experts and the depositions were absolutely devastating
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:37.560]  and they didn't even put their experts on they didn't want to get their experts in front of the jury
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:43.080]  um i one of the persons that i deposed was yohanna olson kennedy she runs one of the largest
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:47.720]  gender clinic for children in america in l.a county where my children now live i bet she makes
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:51.480]  good money doing that it makes millions and millions of dollars must be nice and a lot of it
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:56.600]  subsidized by california by the way it's taxpayer money must be really nice yep and i asked her
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:03.080]  bluntly uh how do you medically justify cutting off healthy body parts from children and she said
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:07.720]  well if they're causing psychological distress they're not healthy and i said thank you i'm
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:13.240]  going to put that from the jury and they didn't put her on so i won that trial i got 50 50 custody
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:19.480]  and no child support they the one proviso was i had to go to a counselor and i had to cover
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:24.200]  nine things with a counselor things like unconditional love of your children recognizing
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:28.200]  the signs of bullying the typical things that they would order in a divorce as if you weren't the one
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:34.760]  already doing i know i know so in a transparently corrupt proceeding the most powerful law family
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:41.160]  law firm in texas coons fuller uh transpin it absolutely transparently corrupt proceeding
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:47.320]  recused the judge that made that ruling against them uh gave me a judge in the 301st district
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:53.720]  court her name is mary brown i call her bloody mary brown uh bloody mary brown uh refused to
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:58.760]  implement the court order giving me 50 50 custody and no child support and through a series of
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:04.760]  temporary orders uh was able to strip me of all of my parental rights to the point where i had
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:10.920]  supervised possession less possession time than convicted pedophiles and they would not let me
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:15.640]  take my son out of address at these supervised possessions forcing me to abuse my son in order
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:21.240]  to see him so i refuse to obey those conditions and instead wrote my son letters and have been
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:27.160]  attempting legal action to change that and what happened was the judge had carefully set up
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:33.880]  orders that allowed my ex-wife to move to california and the previous orders that
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:40.120]  stripped me of my parental rights were carefully constructed based on california law so all of
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:45.000]  those orders prohibit me from talking to my son meeting with my son i i don't know the address
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:50.120]  of my son so i can't write them letters now if you don't have contact with your child for a year
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:55.480]  in california you lose your parental rights they can terminate them without without your consent
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:01.720]  so this judge created the conditions where i can't have any of those contacts required by california
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:08.280]  law and then allowed my ex to move to california well it sounds to me that this is basically
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:14.520]  them saying you had you had day in court you had your day in court and there was a trial and let's
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:18.440]  say it went fairly enough well they didn't like the result so they just flipped the table over and
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:21.480]  said nope we're going to do it again and we're going to make sure we win this time we're going to
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:27.400]  make sure the ref is in our back pocket that's exactly right and um that's one of the huge problems
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:32.360]  that people don't know about family court in every other court whether it's criminal or civil
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:37.960]  once you get a final judgment you're done like you can appeal but you can't go back and get a
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:43.320]  second bite at the apple at that trial but in family courts the trial court lawyers have figured
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:48.760]  out mechanisms using temporary orders to keep that alive i have i've been under constant litigation
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:53.720]  for nine years i've never lived under a final order despite having three trials and three final
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:58.040]  orders i've never lived under them i've lived under temporary orders and just so you know
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:03.960]  you know i had to i had to uber here and i there's a credit card receipt for that that uber receipt
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:09.160]  will be scrutinized by opposing counsel because i have to turn over every single expenditure
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:13.880]  over to them because i'm under these temporary orders right so i don't have any financial
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:19.160]  privacy nothing everything every aspect of my life is scrutinized because of this stuff and so
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:22.200]  now they're just trying to run the clock out on you is what it sounds like they're trying to do
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:29.720]  so the concept here was they wanted to get her to california right before senate bill 107 took
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:35.240]  effect on the first of january and that's what's in this mandate this uh this the subject of this
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:39.080]  ruling by the supreme court so let's get to that on the other side of this break folks you've just

[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:24.520]  so i'm learning more about this from jeff yunger in between the brakes and it's just
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:30.200]  it's crazy because i don't want to get off the topic because i want to get to where we're at
[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:37.960]  today with the supreme court ruling but it's like my goodness the aspect of you having to fight the
[02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:43.960]  entire establishment the aspect of this has now gone beyond the scope of just your family now it's
[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:47.720]  just a whole there's a whole activist wing that you're having to go against they don't have your
[02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:52.520]  kids interest in mind they have their own interest in mind and so there's all kinds of questions
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:56.760]  that i have for you but let's just get back to the story as it is with the update here
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:03.480]  so talk about the supreme court ruling that has you in studio with us today so here's the here's
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:10.120]  the genesis of this she uh she moved to la county in california that's all i know i'm not allowed
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:15.720]  to know where where my children are where they go to school or anything and senate bill 107 takes
[02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:21.560]  effect was going to take effect on the first of january so i was seeking relief from the supreme
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:27.640]  court to get my children back to texas before that law went into effect it's a transgender sanctuary
[02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:34.360]  bill and what it says is that california will not cooperate with any state that doesn't provide
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:39.320]  affirming uh what they call gender affirming healthcare which is the opposite of what it's
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:45.960]  called yes exactly it's it's actually mutilating children yeah so what what it means is california
[02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:54.040]  will not obey subpoenas from texas courts they will not extradite if a court calls for someone's
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:22:01.240]  arrest they will not obey restraining orders or temporary orders or court orders which would
[02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:09.320]  prevent you know gender affirming healthcare it also sets up gender affirming healthcare i'm using
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:14.920]  california's terms as what's called a confidential healthcare they have a status there of confidential
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:20.200]  healthcare so one of the weird things about california it's also an abortion sanctuary state
[02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:24.200]  if you're 12 years old you can consent to an abortion in california without your parents even
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:29.320]  knowing about it because it's considered a confidential healthcare and has a special status
[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:33.480]  as a medical procedure yeah i won't be long till you're be 12 year old will be the age of consent
[02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:37.720]  in california that's right well we know what san francisco is trying to do there yeah the bills
[02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:43.480]  they've introduced so you know uh now the same thing with with these procedures children will be able
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:51.160]  to consent without their parents can consent further judges in in california can do things that
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:57.080]  texas judges can't do a california judge can order a child transitioned with neither parent
[02:22:57.080 --> 02:23:01.880]  consenting if they consider it in the best interests of the child so there are a whole
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:07.640]  host of problems that happen and now she is under an injunction she's not allowed she's under court
[02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:15.160]  order she cannot chemically castrate my son or do any surgical procedures to him okay but how am i
[02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:20.760]  supposed to enforce that injunction after the passage of senate bill 107 in california especially
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:25.960]  if they run the clock out on you and you're not allowed to speak to your son for a year that's
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:33.320]  right that's another thing the the temporary orders that were passed by bloody mary brown and the
[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:39.880]  301st judicial district court in texas bloody mary brown carefully crafted these temporary orders
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:45.880]  to prevent me from satisfying california's contact rules to maintain your parental rights
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:53.880]  so if i follow bloody mary brown's rulings and orders i will inevitably lose my parental rights
[02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:59.000]  in california and i'll have an involuntary involuntary termination of those rights so this
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:03.960]  was carefully set up by the court to take my parental rights in california and it's also
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:10.920]  carefully set up by the court to allow my ex-wife miss georgias to transition my son with no recourse
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:16.120]  this is like a jigsaw trap from the movie saw yeah it's like okay if you want to be free you're
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:20.520]  gonna have to walk through a bed of nails or you know a bunch of cutting cutting wire or something
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:25.080]  that's right so i went to the supreme court of texas because it was an emergency i didn't even
[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:29.880]  go to the appeals court because i didn't have time i went to the supreme court and said
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:35.960]  they're sending my son to a transgender sanctuary state she has tried to transition my son in the
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:41.720]  past that makes her a risk of doing this in california where i have no recourse to enforce
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:46.760]  this but the supreme court strongly disagreed with me and said nope we write california's law
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:52.360]  and despite what the california legislative council says um you can still enforce this
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:57.160]  injunction and what they mean by that is quite sophisticated this is the kind of thing a sophist
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:03.960]  would say sure we can enforce it in texas we can for example call for the return of the children
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:08.600]  we can for example hold miss georgia listen contempt and and jail her if she doesn't follow
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:13.800]  these orders the problem is california won't send her back they're in sanctuary now and they won't
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:20.840]  send my children back so the supreme court really engaged in some tremendous sophistry here to pretend
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:26.600]  that i can enforce this injunction and under california law which i cannot now since the january
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:30.520]  first is passed yeah it sounds like they just want to wipe their hands of the issue that well
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:35.560]  here's the thing i became a political problem for important people in the political establishment
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:42.360]  here right um we know we have a in the republican party there's a civil war between the donor class
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:47.160]  and the voters the voters are conservative voters traditional conservative voters and want
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:52.600]  traditional values in the platform the donors are northeastern liberals and they they don't
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:57.640]  want those traditional values in the platform and what happens is the establishment tries to please
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:03.160]  both so i'm a thorn in their side because until they get rid of me in this state the political
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:10.360]  issue of child transitions is never going to go away but now governor abit you know the homosexual
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:15.960]  acts activists date felon who's the speaker of the house in texas these people can now say hey
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:19.960]  that's california issue it's over in california it's not our issue anymore and the supreme court
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:25.000]  plays duplicity with that because the supreme court is saying well it's still a texas court issue
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:29.320]  and you can still enforce it even though you can never get your kids back over here and they can
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:33.400]  still transition them and then you know because i've noticed this too at the local level not to
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:40.760]  get off topic but the texas gop needs to have a split with the gop at the national level because
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:45.400]  there's a complete conflict of interest there because what i've noticed is at the local level
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:50.440]  you have a lot of these guys they're you know local leaders the republican party that they
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:57.240]  they're not really interested in being a leader per se they're interested in having a nice cushy
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:02.840]  job and having a ladder that they can climb to hopefully get to a nice government position
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:06.680]  or even be a representative maybe something like that and so that's what i've noticed so they're
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:10.040]  not going to press back against the republican establishment they're not going to press back
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:16.120]  against the national gop because they want to be you know they want to coddle to them they want to
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:21.240]  they want to beg for some scraps and keep these most of these jobs are just worthless they work
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:25.720]  like three days a week maybe do a td interview hundred percent and but they represent a lot of
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:30.440]  power remember these are people you know you know uh we complained about nichy and kind of his
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:35.080]  approach but nichy had this really awesome way of looking at things he said let's don't look at what
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:39.960]  the good someone's pursuing let's ask what kind of person would want that good what kind of person
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:44.120]  would want to be in control and empower over other people and you can get a sense of their
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:49.160]  personalities so the game they want to play is they want all that donor money you like to give
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:54.120]  them power and let them move up but they want to please the conservative base so here's the typical
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:58.280]  thing that happens in texas that republican voters just fall for every single time every
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:03.000]  election cycle they're going to propose for example this coming session all kinds of conservative
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:09.240]  bills and those conservatives bills magically will never have time to get to the floor and they'll
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:13.480]  pound their chest about how great the bill is oh absolutely and it just never comes to the floor
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:18.040]  to get about just didn't have time but they can make dr pepper the drink of texas and they can do
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:22.760]  all this other stuff and name bridges but they can't get these conservative bills to a vote so
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:27.320]  what what's really happening is they're killing their own bills behind the scenes in committee
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:35.080]  like they kill their own bills every person i talked to that gets yeah interested or invested
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:38.520]  at the local level tells me that exact same thing they didn't even let me get to that level they
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:41.880]  basically banned me from all their events kicked me out of all their events they didn't even want me
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:46.680]  sniffing around that i already smelled it believe me uh so we're going to be right back here with
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:51.640]  jeff younger i do have some other questions as far as the situation is concerned but you have to

[02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:32.520]  host owin shroyer all right a couple other big issues here with jeff yunger in studio and
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:39.960]  i want to start with the one issue here which is as i wrote down in my notes here
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:47.480]  where are the reinforcements and you were explaining this to me in the break how the the
[02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:53.640]  liberal left activists know because republicans put let's say republicans will put a line in the
[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:57.880]  sand and they won't cross it right liberals won't do that they may put a line in the sand
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:01.880]  but they'll cross it it means nothing yeah so but the republicans and conservatives
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:05.080]  they'll put a line in the sand they won't cross it and so you were explaining to me
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:09.720]  how they have that line in regards to family courts and how the liberals have taken advantage of
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:14.360]  that yeah um none of the conservative uh legal foundations will enter family court
[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:19.880]  and the left has known this for a long time if you recall how how do we get gay marriage
[02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:25.160]  they got a family court in california califf cal another family court in a different federal
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:29.560]  district and got them to disagree and then took it up to the supreme court they went into family
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:35.080]  court to make that law happen okay they know that our guys are not in family court you know when
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:40.760]  i filed this this mandamus this petition for mandamus with the supreme court i had to do it
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:46.520]  as a pro se litigate i had to write my own appellate brief to the supreme court of texas think
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:51.800]  about that for a second just a father trying to protect his kid this is what it takes i could
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:56.120]  not get a return call from any conservative appellate lawyer in this state they will not
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:35:03.800]  touch this case so we have a real issue with uh our our lawyers and our billionaires are just
[02:35:03.800 --> 02:35:08.760]  not stepping up to the plate meanwhile the liberals they know this so it's like a goblin fest yeah
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:12.920]  it's like if the goblins know i don't know let's say there's a goblin smasher okay yes well the
[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:17.160]  god they the goblins know the goblin smasher is not coming here so guess where they all hang out
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:23.160]  that's right and it has attracted some of the worst of the left into family court and so
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:29.000]  you know they see the ability to set precedent for example this supreme court decision on my case
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:35.720]  means that any texas court now can authorize a child to be moved into a transgender sanctuary
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:40.120]  state and so this is the key so let's get into why because here it is this is not
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.560]  look the left is anti-family i don't have to sit here and convince you of that
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:47.560]  the leftist activists they don't care about your son they don't care about your wife they
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:52.440]  couldn't care less what they care about is the result of this case being the precedent setting
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:59.000]  case that's right i think the early on they keyed into this case because of one specific fact
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:06.040]  my son only presents as a girl with his mother with me and everybody else he's always presented
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.800]  as a boy and i think the calculus that they went through was if we can get this boy we can get any
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:17.640]  child we want and they wanted that to be locked into the law and they're using this case to make
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:23.400]  that happen so now they've got it locked into the law that you know if you violate gag orders
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:28.760]  and talk about you know your son being transitioned you can lose all your parental rights if you run
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:34.440]  for political office and you don't follow the restrictions that a judge puts on your political
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:38.280]  speech which is the which they did they tried to stop me from running for office by putting on
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:42.920]  a gag order which restricted me from talking about political topics around transgenderism
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:46.680]  i didn't follow any of those orders and they restricted my my parental rights
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:52.360]  now they're now they've reached the point where now okay texas you've got this attorney general
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:57.080]  opinion which says this is child abuse you may pass a law making these procedures child abuse
[02:36:57.080 --> 02:37:04.920]  that's ken paxton yeah but now any court in texas can you know export a child to a transgender
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:11.640]  sanctuary state and again just just to re-emphasize that it was the judge in this case that let your
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:17.960]  wife take the sons your sons to california she let that happen judge mary brown wrote an affirmative
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:26.040]  order allowing her to move to california after a year long campaign of stripping my parental rights
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:31.240]  to remove all of my ability to follow california's law for contacting your children
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:37.560]  setting me up for termination of parental rights this was set up over 18 months to terminate my
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:45.000]  parental rights by a judge when was the last time you spoke to your sons july of last year
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:50.040]  and what provoked that was and this is the reason i got supervised visitation
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:56.760]  and my son was seeing a court appointed counselor her her name is um susan fletcher uh she was
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:00.760]  an abbot appointee she was on the red flag commission who where they were trying to restrict
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:05.720]  our gun rights based on the psychologist finding she was a psychologist on that on that commission
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:10.040]  appointed by abbot you think it's an accident i got an abbot appointee as my son psychologist i
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:15.480]  don't think so so she's she refused to see my son when he came from my home because when he comes
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:20.520]  from my home is just a normal boy she would only see my son when he came from my ex-wife's home
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:26.440]  when he came as a girl so finally i got possession time in my july summer visitation for a month
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:31.800]  and she had to take my son for two visits during that month and my son flat out told her that he
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:36.040]  didn't want to wear a dress to school and he wants to be a boy she threw him out of the office
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:43.480]  initiated a cps investigation against me produced a report and would not present it with my lawyer
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:48.440]  president and then wrote a letter to the court and never told the court that my son wanted to be a boy
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:56.040]  but said that i i was uh forcing my son to take recordings in in her uh in her office
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:00.840]  and on that basis they gave me supervised visitation so my son asked to be a boy
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:06.520]  and i'm the bad guy you know i don't think you would ever uh and these are my words but you
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:11.400]  know i don't i don't know if a parent would ever wish his son to be obstinate or rebellious at such
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:16.680]  a young age but man uh if i was in your shoes that might be my last hope is that my son is going
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:22.360]  to be an obstinate rebel to these people because it might be the only hope you have left i mean
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:28.120]  i'm just thinking if they don't even let him make up his mind that just shows you it's not about him
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:32.360]  it's never about him and i you know and listen i really didn't push my son i'll tell you what
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:38.680]  i did with my son it's very simple i just showed my son how awesome it is to be a man so we joined
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:44.040]  a boxing gym and my son's learned it doesn't matter if you win your sparring matches it
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:49.400]  doesn't matter if you put in the work everybody respects you if you put in the work if you don't
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:55.320]  put in the work nobody respects you in a boxing gym right you learn humility in a boxing gym you
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:40:01.000]  don't talk smack in a smacking gym it's a good way to get beat down right my son's son's learned
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:06.280]  masculine culture is awesome and they loved it i took them hunting i taught them how to be self
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:11.320]  sufficient you know in my home i didn't even have rules i said look your job is to be reasonable
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:16.760]  with people right i'm not going to set any rules be reasonable with people your room doesn't have
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:21.880]  to be perfectly clean it should just never rise to my attention right and we also had the no mistake
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:26.920]  rule if you make a mistake but you fix it it's not a mistake no punishment no no consequences
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:31.800]  whatsoever so my son's learned very quickly to just take care of themselves and be reasonable
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:37.880]  with people and they loved masculine culture and thrived and i knew that if i had my son 50 50
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:42.920]  and exposed him to masculine culture he'd reject a female identity and he did that in one month
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:47.800]  and on the basis of him rejecting a female identity that took my kids away from me
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:53.320]  well and again that just shows you the agenda here is just targeting your son and and they just
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:58.680]  want a percent they want to overwhelm his own natural instincts they want to overwhelm your your
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:03.000]  instincts as a father and and this is their act of dominance over you this is what the left does
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.320]  it's an act of dominance and it's an act of torture and it's to just say doesn't matter what's common
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:12.120]  sense doesn't matter what sanity we dominate you we own you we're controlling you and i think that's
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:17.560]  why all these activists are in on this case so i mean again you haven't spoken to your sons in
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:22.040]  more than half a year so i mean i imagine that there's a lot of questions that you have i mean
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:25.800]  what about them i mean they are they talking to one another do you know that what about
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:31.160]  influence from the other twin brother that's not being uh told he's gonna be a girl what about you
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:36.760]  know about any of that i've i've written over a hundred pages of letters to my sons and i have no
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:43.320]  idea if they're getting them uh in some sense they're written to their future selves older
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:50.280]  selves looking back on this traumatic incident in their lives um and in some sense it's written to
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:56.840]  ten-year-old boys right um and some of those letters have been actually thrown back at me in
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:01.560]  court and used as evidence against me in court one of them and this is a great example of this
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:07.320]  what you're at and as an answer to your question one of them i talk about the problem is that we
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:15.080]  are being separated by effeminacy in our culture and that that your job right now as boys is to
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:21.640]  avoid effeminacy at all costs while simultaneously being obedient to your mother and that you have
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:28.600]  to recognize that these effeminate forces have a lot of power over you right now but when you grow
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:35.080]  up they won't and this was presented at court as evidence that somehow i hate women oh yeah you're
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:40.280]  misogynist oh yeah absolutely as somehow that i was training my sons to go against their mom and all
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:46.440]  this stuff i also said that the people that have done this to you will ultimately pay and they took
[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:51.080]  that as a threat well and that's the see now you're getting into the i think that that's what fear
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:55.240]  that's what is really they're afraid of as well because they know they're the ones coming in the
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:43:02.600]  crimes we'll be right back there is a war on for your mind your mind is a battlefield this is an

[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:18.360]  vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:26.440]  what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:32.360]  produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3

[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:24.920]  you know i can't even imagine you probably didn't think that fatherhood would be like this
[02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:31.400]  but yet ultimately this is what fatherhood is all about it's it's it's fighting for your kids and
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:37.720]  their future no matter the cost and to me that's you're just you're just fully exemplifying that
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:40.840]  there's so much more to talk about your final segment with jeff i don't know if we want to get
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:46.440]  into date feeling and and people need to know about this guy in texas uh we can continue now with
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:52.760]  the precedent setting case that this is because i think that that's the that that's the big story
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:58.200]  here to me it just so happens that it's you you just happen to be that guy you were the one in
[02:47:58.200 --> 02:48:04.120]  the 300 million that is having to deal with this with your twin boys and so now this is the precedent
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:11.320]  setting case you're trying to warn americans here's what's going on and overall all all things
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:17.480]  considered you know all the juggling act that you have to do here where do you look at the interest
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:22.360]  here the human interest the american interest how much is there how much interest is there for
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:30.040]  common sense protect the kids or do you feel completely overwhelmed by it so it's interesting
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:37.800]  i find that the the people that i talk to even democrats don't believe we should do this to kids
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:44.840]  even protrans people don't believe we should do this to kids this is elites pushing this and these
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:49.480]  elites have taken over professional bodies like the american psychological association like the
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:56.520]  texas psychological association and have started to push this an example here if you bring a child
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:04.280]  who for example is uncomfortable with their gender a psychologist in texas cannot help that child
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:08.680]  identify with their biological sex they consider that reparative therapy and that's against their
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:15.240]  rules a psychologist can only help your child to become transgender so the last place you should
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:21.080]  ever take a child who's got discomfort with their gender or their social roles as a boy or a girl
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:26.520]  the last place you should take them as a psychologist right but remember these psychologists are
[02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:32.280]  testifying in court and so they're making law in the court because there's two kinds of law there's
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:37.480]  statutory law right and then there's case law and case law is binding a statutory law so when
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:42.520]  they make these cases like this the supreme court case that i had to go through this is binding law
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:47.160]  on the courts this is binding precedent on the courts and then anybody whether it's a judge or a
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:53.720]  lawyer or any in the jury now they have this it's like a safety net where they just say well yeah
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:59.320]  i don't like what they're doing to kids but not my fault that's right that's right you know we we
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:03.160]  have this precedent from the supreme court which says they can go and have you know into places
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:08.840]  where these harmful procedures are routinely given to children by courts against their parents wishes
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:13.720]  but the supreme court says it's okay and every lawyer in texas now can use this case it's it's
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:19.560]  just crazy to watch how this works and then to see people's compliance and you know you you sit back
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:24.040]  and you look at human history you know everybody likes to talk about after world war two obviously
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:28.040]  with the nazis and they say how do somebody like that how does somebody like hitler get so much
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:32.040]  control how does somebody get so much influence when you're watching it you're witnessing it
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:37.000]  most of the time it's people that just don't want to get involved it's people that don't want to
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:40.840]  become obstacles they just want to put their hands in the air and at the end of the day say hey it's
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:46.760]  not my fault yeah it's the whole system is designed to make you very uncomfortable it's what i call
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:53.080]  a reverse tyranny and our worst here any is one where we don't actually put you in a gulag
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:58.760]  put you in a gulag instead we make you very comfortable and very secure and when we want you
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:03.640]  to do something we selectively remove that security to get you to act the way we want and we can
[02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:08.840]  threaten you with removal of material security anytime we want this is just a mechanism for them
[02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:12.840]  for them to threaten families with removal of their children yep and that's what they've done
[02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:18.040]  this particular court in dallas county with judge mary brown she's a committed radical leftist this
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:22.200]  judge just decided she didn't want my son's raised by a conservative and she wasn't gonna allow it
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:26.360]  to the point where she'll let him go to california became like he castrated and that's what i was
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:31.880]  saying earlier where it is cutting off the nose despite the face as they do this all the time
[02:51:31.880 --> 02:51:36.440]  the liberals these days will cut off their ear their nose they'll gouge their eyes out if it
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:41.480]  spikes their face as long as it spikes you too yes as long as you're spited that's right you
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:45.080]  know there there's a there's sure i'm blind and i can't hear and i don't have a nose or a mouth
[02:51:45.080 --> 02:51:50.200]  anymore but i made your life living hell didn't i now there's there's an old greek proverb that
[02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:56.760]  two guys got into a feud and they uh they had both harmed each other and the punishment imposed
[02:51:57.320 --> 02:52:02.200]  by the by the wise king was that they both be blinded right they both suffered from this
[02:52:02.200 --> 02:52:06.280]  and the left is perfectly happy with that yeah both blind were equal yep and they're perfectly
[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:11.080]  okay with that it doesn't bother them at all and it's just a shame that you're witnessing this
[02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:17.320]  play out in the legal process here's one of my the questions that continues to come into my head
[02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:22.360]  just trying to sort through this and make sense of it is you know what is the motive here i mean is
[02:52:22.360 --> 02:52:28.760]  it money is it access i think about if i go for the worst motive i say they want access to kids i
[02:52:28.760 --> 02:52:33.400]  mean that's what the you have perverts that want access to kids that's that's like the maybe the
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:37.960]  worst darkest potential motive but i think it's there and then the most obvious one is money
[02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:43.160]  right i mean these trans surgeries are not cheap the chemical the chemicals and the drugs are not
[02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:47.240]  cheap plus you've got a customer for the rest of their life so they're going to be giving you money
[02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:51.960]  so there's the obvious motive of money and then there's maybe the less obvious more sorted motive
[02:52:51.960 --> 02:52:57.640]  of they want access to these kids yeah the lupron which is the puberty blockers the most expensive
[02:52:57.640 --> 02:53:02.760]  drug in the world oh wow yeah um and it's a main one place in israel it's made there and it's the
[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:08.280]  most expensive drug in the world um the the other thing is once a child uh goes on these
[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:12.840]  puberty blockers and cross-exhormones they have a lot the average lifetime income stream is four
[02:53:12.840 --> 02:53:17.720]  million dollars to these clinics so if you've got three thousand kids you can imagine how much
[02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:23.320]  money is at stake there you're talking billions of dollars in this country alone um and but i
[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:28.840]  think there's an ideological reason you know i think the reason obama made the transgender
[02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:33.640]  procedures and made entrance companies pay for it right which encouraged hospitals to open up
[02:53:33.640 --> 02:53:39.480]  the clinics which created a market for it um and now you see that market you see it's huge it's huge
[02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:45.320]  now but this is the thing they monetize it to make the market grow that's that's why they do it but
[02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:50.920]  i think there's an ideological reason here fundamentally they know that the middle class
[02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:57.400]  in europe and america have to be broken they can't get their reverse tyranny why is claus schwaab
[02:53:57.400 --> 02:54:03.640]  said you will own nothing and be happy right they can't get that reverse tyranny with the middle
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:08.360]  class because these middle classes still believe in things like free speech they still believe
[02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:11.720]  that they should be able to raise their children the way they want and as long as you have a large
[02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:16.440]  middle class it can't be dominated it cannot be dominated and because it represents the majority
[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:22.680]  of voters as well right so that there's a there's an attempt to undermine the traditional family to
[02:54:22.680 --> 02:54:27.880]  undermine the political power of the middle class to create a reverse tyranny and i believe that is
[02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:32.920]  the basic agenda of the globalist towards the family transgenderism is one that's particularly
[02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:38.680]  potent because if you look at the diagnostic criteria to be transgendered for a child to be
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:43.880]  transgendered it just means that they do some girly stuff if you read the it's they just do some
[02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:50.200]  girly stuff and you can be transgendered and it allows a subjective psychologist to take away
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:55.640]  parental rights almost at will which is of course absurd you know and i think about your your twin
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:00.360]  boys now you said they're nine years old right they're 10 now 10 now and so i think about it
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:05.560]  but i remember and i hated this as a kid but it happened a couple of times i was probably like
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:09.880]  four or five years old and i had some older cousins or female cousins and they like to
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:14.040]  play with barbie dolls and do dress up and you know what they may grab a little three-year-old
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:17.880]  Owen and say hey you're gonna be part of our wedding ceremony and you're gonna you're gonna
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:21.960]  wear this tr or something and i'm gonna go in there you know i don't want to do that no they're
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:27.240]  older cousins it's funny to them whatever oh so oh so mom comes down and sees the the cousins
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:33.960]  using me for their princess you know movie theater wedding thing transit oh i'm trans now like that's
[02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:38.840]  just i mean that's completely absurd but okay getting beyond that they're of the age now too
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:44.120]  where i mean i'd say probably definitely by the time you're 10 maybe by the time you're about six i
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:49.400]  remember by the time i was in and through kindergarten it was like i i knew what i liked i knew what i
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:53.640]  liked i started playing sports i started riding bikes street hockey i was reading sports illustrated
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:57.080]  like you know that you know you kind of figure out what you're into what you like sure especially
[02:55:57.080 --> 02:56:02.440]  by the time you're 10 years old so i mean what do you think is going on right now as your boys are
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:09.720]  discovering their identities but yet also maybe feeling pressure not to be that i think my ex-wife
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:17.640]  is using her medical and psychological knowledge to carefully condition my son's experiences
[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:23.160]  to push them towards certain leftist ideas and leftist identities james in particular
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:28.040]  you know james's outright told counselors they've said well why do you dress as a girl at your mom's
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:34.120]  house but not your dad's and he said mommy doesn't love me if i'm not a girl so there's a deep seated
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:39.800]  can you know operant conditioning that has happened with james um so i'm hoping that
[02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:45.720]  my you know the few years that i was able to expose him to masculine culture and to see why it's so
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:51.960]  great to be a man i'm hoping that that will overcome it even in my absence or maybe also you
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:56.920]  know your your other twin boy just being into that as well i mean i had a couple i actually had a
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:00.680]  couple friends that were twin brothers one was triplet brothers and i'd hang out with them we
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:06.920]  all did the same thing we were all into the same things sure absolutely yeah jude um i name it at
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:12.840]  the brothers of jesus james and jude you know um jude has a has a particular issue with the moral
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:20.040]  question because he knows his his brother's not a girl and uh he came to me asked me well when
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:25.320]  am i supposed to lie about it when am i supposed to tell the truth about it and for him it's become
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:31.400]  a moral quandary that i don't think his mother is going to do a good job helping himself well like i
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:38.120]  said my words not yours it but uh i would probably be hoping that my two boys turn out to be very
[02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:44.040]  obstinate i hope so too and uh maybe that can be the best chance you have for them to come out of
[02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:49.720]  this all right jeff junger thank you so much thank you you want to beat the new world order you want to

[03:20:42.920 --> 03:20:50.600]  ahead i want to give you some information on some of the top trends for 2023 and one of them is going
[03:20:50.600 --> 03:21:03.160]  to be a economic calamity and a market meltdown you go back to our trends journal about a month
[03:21:03.160 --> 03:21:16.200]  ago we said if there's not a Santa Claus rally when the markets reopen on january third you're
[03:21:16.200 --> 03:21:22.440]  going to start seeing a big decline in equities now there are a number of sides to different
[03:21:22.440 --> 03:21:32.840]  stories so again there are a lot of wildcards and when you look for example following the last 40
[03:21:34.360 --> 03:21:43.160]  midterm elections the s and p 500 went up over 15 percent for the first 12 months
[03:21:44.360 --> 03:21:50.440]  but this time it's a different scenario because the whole market situation was
[03:21:50.440 --> 03:21:58.520]  artificially pumped up with zero and negative interest rate policies in the united states europe
[03:21:58.520 --> 03:22:05.640]  and around the world and governments pumped in countless trillions of dollars they all did this
[03:22:05.640 --> 03:22:11.480]  to fight the coven war the people did everything that they were told because they were given free
[03:22:11.480 --> 03:22:19.160]  money businesses got free money it was it was a game they artificially boosted everything now you
[03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:26.520]  go back i'm only speaking about the facts you had the fed head clown mr. own power
[03:22:28.280 --> 03:22:37.880]  and janet yellen screaming that inflation was only temporary and then transitory going back two
[03:22:37.880 --> 03:22:45.880]  years ago wrote about it in details as they were saying it and then now they're saying that inflation
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:54.680]  was caused by supply chain disruptions you know there she is miss fatia bluetooth we're the same age
[03:22:54.680 --> 03:23:04.600]  marona me who wouldn't be dating you baby cakes maron anyway they swat they put out the crap out
[03:23:04.600 --> 03:23:13.240]  there that it was only temporary and transitory and transgendatory to be proper they either
[03:23:13.240 --> 03:23:17.640]  were lying or knew it was a fact but they did this to artificially keep propping up the equity
[03:23:17.640 --> 03:23:24.120]  markets as they destroyed the global economy and china of course has done its role in it too they're
[03:23:24.120 --> 03:23:29.720]  in a disaster hit you know the businesses that have been destroyed in china with the zero lock
[03:23:29.720 --> 03:23:34.280]  i'm not coming back by the way the streets are dead i went out new year's eve to a party
[03:23:35.320 --> 03:23:42.520]  and i came back a little after 12 and i screwed 28 from woodstock to here which is the major
[03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:50.760]  artery going out through there i counted five cars i remember back in the day 12 o'clock at night the
[03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:59.960]  roads were packed people party it's dead all over they sucked a joy out of life so going back to the
[03:23:59.960 --> 03:24:07.640]  markets here's the deal the markets are going to crash and there's going to be an economic calamity
[03:24:07.640 --> 03:24:16.920]  if because i can't nobody could tell you the yes or no about it if the federal reserve
[03:24:17.960 --> 03:24:25.080]  when they have their meeting and then on february first they come out and say how much they're
[03:24:25.080 --> 03:24:33.320]  going to raise interest rates even if they raise them 25 basis points that will be
[03:24:33.320 --> 03:24:41.560]  enough to keep sinking the equity markets and the economy now let's go back to the story on
[03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:47.080]  the whole picture all of these private equity groups and all of these hedge funds that bought
[03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:53.960]  up all of these businesses merger and acquisition activity was at the highest rate ever in 2021
[03:24:53.960 --> 03:24:59.320]  because at all this cheap money now those businesses are going down they got to pay the
[03:24:59.320 --> 03:25:07.080]  loans on this oh and interest rates went up now you got to pay more on your variable rate loans oh
[03:25:07.080 --> 03:25:13.480]  and by the way as interest rates go up the united states says it's what 31 trillion dollar debt bubble
[03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:19.240]  oh and now you got to pay more on your debt
[03:25:22.680 --> 03:25:28.760]  now let's go back to what happened to the equity markets it was the worst downturn since
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:37.000]  the panic of 08 2008 and by the way the trends research institute which is the publisher of the
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:50.120]  trends journal our company took out a domain name panic of 08 in 2007 you're seeing the nasdaq down
[03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:58.920]  33 percent deep in bear territory s and p 500 just hanging on a thread 19 percent down bear territories
[03:25:58.920 --> 03:26:08.120]  20 the the dows down almost 9 percent and then you go around the world and you look at the at the
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:15.720]  broad indexes they're down like 18 percent now with interest rates going up the cheap money
[03:26:15.720 --> 03:26:22.120]  supplies stopping this thing's going to go down big and then the biggest bust is going to be
[03:26:23.960 --> 03:26:31.000]  in the office business office commercial sector you're looking at places like boston
[03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:38.840]  with an office occupancy rate of 40 percent you're looking on average in the united states at best
[03:26:38.840 --> 03:26:49.400]  50 percent now leases are coming up the work at home trend is real and it's going to continue
[03:26:50.520 --> 03:26:55.160]  when people will lock down they say to themselves holy christ i'm getting up at five in the morning
[03:26:55.160 --> 03:26:59.240]  to drive an hour and a half to work get an hour hour and a half back i'm not going to do that
[03:26:59.240 --> 03:27:05.400]  anymore and now when business is going down the people have commercial business uh offices
[03:27:05.400 --> 03:27:11.800]  hey i don't need all this space i could save myself a lot of money you are going to see a
[03:27:11.800 --> 03:27:18.920]  collapse in the office building sector commercial buildings unprecedented oh and all those businesses
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:30.520]  that depended on communities see you later gone finito we are in for the worst crash ever but again
[03:27:30.520 --> 03:27:40.040]  you cannot predict the wild card that might be played and the wild card is this just as they
[03:27:40.040 --> 03:27:50.200]  did it under trump when the markets were crashing in december of 2018 trump pushed powell the fed
[03:27:50.200 --> 03:27:58.360]  head to lower interest rates and he did that artificially popped the market back up so will
[03:27:58.360 --> 03:28:07.320]  there be pressure from washington and from the gamblers on the street to pressure the feds
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:22.360]  not to raise interest rates so according to fact set the word on the street is the fed may begin
[03:28:22.360 --> 03:28:33.320]  may begin lowering interest rates this year so when they lower interest rates boom inflation
[03:28:33.320 --> 03:28:41.720]  goes up and guess what so too to gold prices and silver prices that's what we're trying to do
[03:28:41.720 --> 03:28:49.000]  giving you the big picture to help you prepare prevail and prosper but we're telling you very

[03:49:18.920 --> 03:49:28.360]  1963 just about five months before they assassinated him today should total war break out no matter how
[03:49:28.360 --> 03:49:36.200]  our two countries meaning the united states and soviet union will be no matter how our two countries
[03:49:36.200 --> 03:49:42.760]  will be the primary targets meaning soviet union united states it is an ironic but accurate fact
[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:49.160]  that the two strongest powers are the two and the most danger of devastation
[03:49:49.160 --> 03:50:03.960]  all we have built all we have worked for would be destroyed in the first 24 hours

[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:41.960]  we're going to perish but people have no idea about this and all they do is they believe the

[03:50:59.320 --> 03:51:06.440]  two and i mentioned that they tell us that world war one began when they assassinated
[03:51:06.440 --> 03:51:11.880]  archduke ferdan at sarajevo like what's an archduke and where's a sarajevo who cares
[03:51:11.880 --> 03:51:16.280]  was building up to that because they could keep doing mission creep just like they're doing with
[03:51:16.280 --> 03:51:22.200]  the united states having quote advisors in ukraine not making that up that's in the mouth of
[03:51:22.200 --> 03:51:27.080]  loyto austin our secretary of defense whose last job was sitting on rathion's board of directors
[03:51:27.080 --> 03:51:33.880]  the second largest defense contract so it's mission creep and the united states advisors are
[03:51:33.880 --> 03:51:37.800]  showing the ukranians how to use our weapons which means they're firing them basically
[03:51:38.760 --> 03:51:43.800]  shooting at the russian so anyway it's mission creep it doesn't happen automatically so i and
