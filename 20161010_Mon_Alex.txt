[00:00.000 --> 00:28.320]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:28.320 --> 00:34.400]  It's Monday, October 10th, 2016, the world is watching.
[00:34.400 --> 00:40.120]  Trump has climbed back from the edge of destruction with a devastating victory.
[00:40.120 --> 00:45.480]  Three against one, the planet is watching as the United States attempts to pull out of
[00:45.480 --> 00:50.560]  the new world order and global government and reestablish self-determination.
[00:50.560 --> 00:55.120]  This is the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:55.120 --> 01:01.000]  I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.
[01:01.000 --> 01:09.400]  But if I win, I am going to instruct my Attorney General to get a special prosecutor to look
[01:09.400 --> 01:15.520]  into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.
[01:15.520 --> 01:19.920]  There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.
[01:19.920 --> 01:24.940]  When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.
[01:24.940 --> 01:30.360]  In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.
[01:30.360 --> 01:35.680]  There has never been anything like this, where emails and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena,
[01:35.680 --> 01:41.800]  and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them
[01:41.800 --> 01:45.480]  or bleach them, as you would say, a very expensive process.
[01:45.480 --> 01:48.800]  So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you
[01:48.800 --> 01:54.920]  know what, people have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what
[01:54.920 --> 01:59.160]  you've done, and it's a disgrace, and honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[01:59.160 --> 02:05.080]  You know, it is, it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.920]  is not in charge of the law in our country, because you're being jailed.
[02:09.920 --> 02:10.920]  Secretary Clinton.
[02:10.920 --> 02:11.920]  Being jailed.
[02:11.920 --> 02:14.600]  Yes, that man needs to be president.
[02:14.600 --> 02:21.920]  Federal leadership absolutely has her in the target sites, and now is pulling the trigger.
[02:21.920 --> 02:26.800]  This is an incredible time to be alive, and I am so glad to be here.
[02:26.800 --> 02:29.120]  We're going to play tons of the debate.
[02:29.120 --> 02:33.560]  If he would have done this in the first one, he'd be 20 points ahead, not just 10 points
[02:33.560 --> 02:35.160]  ahead in the real polls.
[02:35.160 --> 02:37.360]  They know there's a landslide coming.
[02:37.360 --> 02:43.240]  They know Bill Clinton's sex crimes are coming out, the rape settlements, they're desperate,
[02:43.240 --> 02:47.520]  they are going to bring out incredible hoaxes.
[02:47.520 --> 02:50.600]  They're going to hire women to say Trump raped him.
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.000]  Never a history of this in 40-plus years.
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.000]  Longer than that.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.200]  I mean, the guy's 70, so he's been above 20, you know, for a long time, 50 years.
[03:01.200 --> 03:02.200]  Never.
[03:02.200 --> 03:04.040]  Women say he spoils the living daylights out of him.
[03:04.040 --> 03:08.000]  In the so-called dirty talk tape, he's trying to lavish the woman with gifts.
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.520]  In fact, that's what they say, Trump avalanches women with jewelry and everything else, and
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.440]  then if they're ever mean to him or treating bad, he's gone like that.
[03:19.440 --> 03:26.560]  You treat Donald Trump bad, it's a well-known MO, he's gone, gone.
[03:26.560 --> 03:32.360]  And I'm here to tell you, locker room talk, listen, once these criminals that sold us
[03:32.360 --> 03:38.000]  off the Communist Chinese and funded the radical jihadis and opened our borders and engaged
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.400]  in every crime you can imagine, like creating derivatives, getting rid of Glass-Steagall,
[03:42.400 --> 03:46.520]  starting all these illegal wars, putting more hardcore sanctions on than even Herbert Walker
[03:46.520 --> 03:52.080]  Bush did and killing over a half million children, they admit that.
[03:52.080 --> 03:56.920]  That's the real crime here and saying it's a good price to pay.
[03:56.920 --> 04:02.800]  Once they're in trouble for selling blood filled with AIDS and HIV, HIV that causes
[04:02.800 --> 04:06.840]  AIDS and hepatitis, I mean, the crimes go on and on, it makes the head spin.
[04:06.840 --> 04:12.600]  Once she ever got in trouble for that, then we could take Donald Trump to the woodshed
[04:12.600 --> 04:15.040]  for shooting his mouth off.
[04:15.040 --> 04:18.160]  I've talked to people that know Donald Trump very well, not just Roger Stone, but other
[04:18.160 --> 04:25.960]  folks in Hollywood and famous actors, and yes, I've talked to a very famous model that
[04:25.960 --> 04:28.000]  was going to stop right there.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.080]  And they said, if anyone knew how straight-laced Donald Trump was, it would make their head
[04:32.080 --> 04:33.080]  spin.
[04:33.080 --> 04:34.520]  That's him like a little kid trying to act cool.
[04:34.520 --> 04:39.800]  The guy is so straight-laced, he eats like a half gallon of ice cream every night.
[04:39.800 --> 04:40.800]  He's like a little kid.
[04:40.800 --> 04:41.800]  Okay.
[04:41.800 --> 04:46.960]  I mean, he's very smart, but it's just, I'm saying this stuff, Trump probably doesn't
[04:46.960 --> 04:47.960]  want out there.
[04:47.960 --> 04:52.520]  The point is, is that he's Mr. Good Boy.
[04:52.520 --> 04:53.520]  Okay.
[04:53.520 --> 04:56.040]  And that's why he sounded like a 14-year-old.
[04:56.040 --> 04:57.040]  We'll be back.
[04:57.040 --> 04:58.040]  It's epic.
[04:58.040 --> 04:59.040]  Stay with us.
[04:59.040 --> 05:07.760]  Hillary Clinton has been caught in yet another staged fake town hall event as she takes questions
[05:07.760 --> 05:11.040]  from a child actor in Harvard, Pennsylvania.
[05:11.040 --> 05:15.240]  The mainstream media immediately picked up the clip and aired the footage nationwide.
[05:15.240 --> 05:16.240]  Hi, Madam Secretary.
[05:16.240 --> 05:19.240]  I'm Brennan, and I'm 15 years old.
[05:19.240 --> 05:23.400]  At my school, body image is a really big issue for girls my age.
[05:23.400 --> 05:27.600]  I see with my own eyes the damage Donald Trump does when he talks about women and how they
[05:27.600 --> 05:28.600]  look.
[05:28.600 --> 05:32.120]  As the first female president, how would you undo some of that damage?
[05:32.120 --> 05:37.600]  But they failed to make the connection that the 15-year-old girl is a child actor named
[05:37.600 --> 05:44.080]  Brennan Leach, whose father is a state senator and staunch reporter of Hillary's campaign.
[05:44.080 --> 05:48.760]  She's also appeared in political ads for her father featuring Bill Clinton.
[05:48.760 --> 05:51.480]  He seems like a great guy.
[05:51.480 --> 05:53.800]  I wouldn't let my daughter near that guy.
[05:53.800 --> 06:21.880]  And you can see more reports right now at infowars.com.
[06:21.880 --> 06:51.040]  And you can see more reports right now at infowarsteam.com.
[06:51.040 --> 06:55.920]  Many people call into my radio show and tell me how young Jebedy and the products at infowarsteam.com

[07:27.720 --> 07:29.200]  The app is brand new.
[07:29.200 --> 07:32.720]  This is the first release, and it was completely built from the ground up.
[07:32.720 --> 07:36.440]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[07:36.440 --> 07:40.280]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces
[07:40.280 --> 07:44.560]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment
[07:44.560 --> 07:45.560]  agendas.
[07:45.560 --> 07:50.480]  But infowars live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.
[07:50.480 --> 07:55.800]  So download infowars live today at infowars.com and learn what's really going on instead of
[07:55.800 --> 08:22.200]  being spoon-fed lies by the mainstream media.
[08:22.200 --> 08:27.920]  I have never been more sure about my gut that Donald Trump is the man to rally the people
[08:27.920 --> 08:32.640]  who try to restore this republic.
[08:32.640 --> 08:37.000]  And quite frankly, behind the scenes, I have gotten very aggressive in the last week.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.960]  And you've seen the videos I've put out, and I have basically sent the message, and I know
[08:42.960 --> 08:48.840]  the listeners have as well, to some of the Trump camp that stop telling him to wear gloves,
[08:48.840 --> 08:50.560]  stop telling him to sit there and take it.
[08:50.560 --> 08:53.320]  And I know he's been told that.
[08:53.320 --> 08:57.000]  And you saw Donald Trump last night, he tore the living hell out of Hillary.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.320]  And he did it just right.
[09:00.320 --> 09:03.480]  That's why they tried to spin the whole thing and say he was looming behind her, standing
[09:03.480 --> 09:10.800]  by his chair, and then she would get in front, and then they would say, look, he's a bully.
[09:10.800 --> 09:12.080]  That's all over the news.
[09:12.080 --> 09:18.240]  This is how they take this huge victory and try to turn into that he's this bully of women.
[09:18.240 --> 09:25.360]  And Hillary Clinton represented a known pedophile who raped and put a 12-year-old girl in a
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.880]  coma for five days.
[09:28.880 --> 09:33.000]  When Hillary Clinton has been caught on two tapes laughing about it, saying she knew he
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.760]  was guilty, when she pushes partial birth abortion of eight-month-old babies, when she pushes
[09:39.760 --> 09:45.520]  funding jihadis and stays in the same hotel room with a woman who's a jihadi, whose mother
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.080]  is the top pusher of general immunization.
[09:49.080 --> 09:53.400]  And she funds jihadis worldwide, murdering Christians by the hundreds of thousands.
[09:53.400 --> 09:59.360]  She is a architect of Syria, an architect of the fall apart in Iraq and the destabilization.
[09:59.360 --> 10:00.360]  That's their plan.
[10:00.360 --> 10:03.080]  An architect of Libya.
[10:03.080 --> 10:06.720]  The plan is deindustrialization, dehumanization.
[10:06.720 --> 10:11.840]  Take secular countries, overthrow it, depopulate them, put jihadis in charge of them.
[10:11.840 --> 10:17.560]  See, I'm not, quote, Islamophobic of some people that are not radical, extreme, orthodox
[10:17.560 --> 10:19.640]  Wahhabist.
[10:19.640 --> 10:23.800]  But I have to fight Islam now because it's run by Wahhabist.
[10:23.800 --> 10:25.200]  It's satanic.
[10:25.200 --> 10:27.840]  They chop up people and make prisoners eat them.
[10:27.840 --> 10:33.360]  They put five-year-old girls in sex slavery and we're being invaded by it.
[10:33.360 --> 10:39.520]  This weekend when I was shooting a video up on an overlook on 360 over the famous 360 bridge,
[10:39.520 --> 10:43.320]  there were a bunch of guys and I could tell they were from Saudi Arabia and they were
[10:43.320 --> 10:49.080]  all running around, jabbering in Arabic, going, look Alex Jones, and they would try to get
[10:49.080 --> 10:52.520]  the camera shot and cut into what I was doing.
[10:52.520 --> 10:54.920]  And at a certain point I said, why don't you just get the hell out of the country?
[10:54.920 --> 10:55.920]  I was there with Zimmerman.
[10:55.920 --> 10:58.360]  So just get the hell out of here if you don't like it.
[10:58.360 --> 10:59.880]  You don't think I don't know what you're doing?
[10:59.880 --> 11:00.880]  They all kind of backed off.
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.040]  It's like, yeah, I'm done playing games, okay?
[11:05.040 --> 11:07.320]  I'm done.
[11:07.320 --> 11:09.560]  Kill your hand.
[11:09.560 --> 11:10.560]  You're looking for trouble?
[11:10.560 --> 11:11.560]  You got it.
[11:11.560 --> 11:12.560]  Obama?
[11:12.560 --> 11:13.560]  Hillary?
[11:13.560 --> 11:14.560]  Bill Clinton?
[11:14.560 --> 11:15.560]  You're looking for trouble.
[11:15.560 --> 11:16.560]  You got it.
[11:16.560 --> 11:17.560]  You understand?
[11:17.560 --> 11:18.560]  You got it.
[11:18.560 --> 11:19.560]  I can only be pushed so far.
[11:19.560 --> 11:20.560]  It's got red hot, man.
[11:20.560 --> 11:21.560]  It's got angry.
[11:21.560 --> 11:22.560]  Going back to that hilltop.
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.600]  Because it went off for like 20 minutes and I'm trying to interfere with the shot.
[11:28.600 --> 11:29.600]  Zimmerman was there.
[11:29.600 --> 11:30.600]  He saw it.
[11:30.600 --> 11:34.880]  I just kind of turned around and looked at him and I said, if your damn country's so
[11:34.880 --> 11:37.480]  good, why don't you go the hell back to it, man?
[11:37.480 --> 11:42.240]  You want to come conquer me with all those people who have this arrogance and I'm tired
[11:42.240 --> 11:44.760]  of it and I'm fed up.
[11:44.760 --> 11:53.640]  But I thought of how similar radical jihadis are and slimy, how they're just like liberals.
[11:53.640 --> 11:57.840]  They're all fake and how they're intellectual and they're smart and they just have this
[11:57.840 --> 11:58.840]  fake arrogance.
[11:58.840 --> 12:04.080]  I'm so sick of people that have arrogance but don't have anything behind it.
[12:04.080 --> 12:09.760]  They got big, giant 14 foot around cowboy hats and they've never seen a cow.
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.080]  They're all hat and no cattle and that's what this whole new world order is about.
[12:14.080 --> 12:15.080]  Hillary Clinton.
[12:15.080 --> 12:16.080]  Bill Clinton.
[12:16.080 --> 12:17.080]  Go to drudgerport.com.
[12:17.080 --> 12:19.160]  He's like to our story, top story.
[12:19.160 --> 12:24.080]  New WikiLeaks email, Clinton campaign, insider's fear, Bill's sex life could sink Hillary.
[12:24.080 --> 12:25.080]  Yeah, no kidding.
[12:25.080 --> 12:29.080]  I'll tell you a little sink, Hillary.
[12:29.080 --> 12:33.000]  Is Donald Trump breaking the hoax and he did it last night, breaking the matrix?
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.080]  Look at Bill Clinton right there, if you're a TV viewer, radio listeners, you all saw
[12:36.080 --> 12:37.080]  him last night.
[12:37.080 --> 12:38.080]  I want to slow that down.
[12:38.080 --> 12:39.480]  I want to get the actual video.
[12:39.480 --> 12:40.480]  We have it in HD in there.
[12:40.480 --> 12:41.480]  It's all over the web.
[12:41.480 --> 12:48.680]  I want to slow that down to where it's basically a frame every second or so.
[12:48.680 --> 12:53.880]  I want to just slow it down until like a one minute video of him just over like three seconds.
[12:53.880 --> 12:59.960]  Just slowly to see the demon, the big intimidator, the guy that beats women, bites women, assaults
[12:59.960 --> 13:00.960]  women.
[13:00.960 --> 13:06.360]  Because he's got to have it, an animal.
[13:06.360 --> 13:10.800]  And that is the Trump campaign ad, is that monster and his enabler.
[13:10.800 --> 13:13.720]  He's not homosexual.
[13:13.720 --> 13:17.400]  Hillary isn't his beard for men.
[13:17.400 --> 13:19.480]  Hillary is his beard.
[13:19.480 --> 13:22.000]  Hillary's got pregnant with lesser Hubble.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.360]  That's well known.
[13:24.360 --> 13:30.240]  She's there to cover for him and she always has, and that's why she's the boss.
[13:30.240 --> 13:33.560]  Because he's the drug addict, he's the one that doesn't work, he's the one that's got
[13:33.560 --> 13:39.520]  to have up to 10 women a day on average, he's the one taking ecstasy and cocaine and methamphetamine
[13:39.520 --> 13:41.020]  for decades.
[13:41.020 --> 13:44.360]  He's the drug addict and she can't stand him.
[13:44.360 --> 13:45.360]  That's why she didn't defend him.
[13:45.360 --> 13:49.040]  But let me tell you something, you look at that monster as a country, we're going to
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.840]  put that back in the White House and give me a break.
[13:53.840 --> 13:58.400]  All right, let me break down what happened last night from my view.
[13:58.400 --> 13:59.400]  We're going to open the phones up today.
[13:59.400 --> 14:02.400]  I really want to take a lot of your calls on the debate, I don't have what this says,
[14:02.400 --> 14:03.400]  but listen to me.
[14:03.400 --> 14:10.680]  I had family call me, I had people come up to me on the street this weekend, I got emails,
[14:10.680 --> 14:21.120]  I had crew, people despondent saying, oh my gosh, this locker room talk, it's over.
[14:21.120 --> 14:26.120]  11 years old, taken out of context, it's a Bush nephew.
[14:26.120 --> 14:32.040]  All things clearly a setup and that's all you've got.
[14:32.040 --> 14:37.200]  I mean, I'm a pretty straightforward righteous guy on average, but I talk about how I'm a
[14:37.200 --> 14:38.200]  sinner.
[14:38.200 --> 14:43.320]  Sometimes just out of the blue, I'll say something really mean to a family member, sometimes
[14:43.320 --> 14:48.840]  I'll catch myself saying something really nasty, just out of the blue, really vulgar.
[14:48.840 --> 14:54.840]  And that's why I say even people that are good-hearted aren't perfect, but I mean, this
[14:54.840 --> 15:00.520]  is his crime, I'm not a super hot woman, he can tell it's all edited, he goes, oh, then
[15:00.520 --> 15:01.520]  I found out she was married.
[15:01.520 --> 15:03.240]  That was clearly all out of context.
[15:03.240 --> 15:06.040]  I've experienced people cutting my audio and moving it around.
[15:06.040 --> 15:07.040]  You can hear it.
[15:07.040 --> 15:11.560]  In fact, I want to take the raw audio that first aired, the Washington Post put out,
[15:11.560 --> 15:15.080]  and I want to show people on a graph, you can, because I hear it.
[15:15.080 --> 15:16.080]  I mean, I'm an audio editor.
[15:16.080 --> 15:19.960]  I've been doing this myself for 25 years, not to distort just cutting stuff out.
[15:19.960 --> 15:25.440]  I heard the points where it was being edited, and the background noise was different, different
[15:25.440 --> 15:29.320]  oscillations of the bus, different things happening.
[15:29.320 --> 15:32.280]  Part of that was recorded when the bus wasn't even moving, then part of it was recorded
[15:32.280 --> 15:33.280]  when it is.
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.240]  You can tell he was baiting him in the whole time, and then moving it around once they
[15:38.240 --> 15:40.440]  released it to make it sound like he was saying he was going after her.
[15:40.440 --> 15:43.920]  No, he learned she's married, and then backs off of it.
[15:43.920 --> 15:45.560]  But Trump didn't even defend it.
[15:45.560 --> 15:46.800]  He knew the public wouldn't get that.
[15:46.800 --> 15:49.840]  He just said, okay, I apologize, locker room talk, let's move forward.
[15:49.840 --> 15:54.080]  Just like when he's on Howard Stern to pitch his hotels and things, because Howard Stern
[15:54.080 --> 15:57.040]  has a gigantic show, especially back when he was going on it.
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.080]  I mean, it was reaching 30 million people a week sometimes, on top of folks that go
[16:01.080 --> 16:06.320]  to casinos and go to hotels, and I'm not defending any of it, but imagine, Stern's asking him
[16:06.320 --> 16:08.160]  all these questions, he does that when I come on.
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.760]  He does this to everybody, and Trump's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[16:12.760 --> 16:13.760]  let's get back to this.
[16:13.760 --> 16:18.400]  Yeah, yeah, okay, maybe Iraq's okay, you know, three years after we're already in there.
[16:18.400 --> 16:20.240]  Sure, we had the Iraq war.
[16:20.240 --> 16:23.880]  He was on Fox, CNN, you name it, we've played the tapes, saying it's a bad idea, we shouldn't
[16:23.880 --> 16:24.880]  do it.
[16:24.880 --> 16:27.480]  Once we were in there, he said, well, I'm not going to knock back the troops.
[16:27.480 --> 16:30.560]  I thought it was a bad idea, but okay, now we can't just leave the place, because it's
[16:30.560 --> 16:32.240]  going to fall apart like it happened.
[16:32.240 --> 16:36.760]  The guy's really smart, and he listens to top generals.
[16:36.760 --> 16:41.160]  So we've got Hillary's potting mouth and all the things she's been caught doing.
[16:41.160 --> 16:46.320]  Just get that effing dog out of my way, said Secret Service K9 Handler.
[16:46.320 --> 16:47.640]  Where is the GD flag?
[16:47.640 --> 16:53.720]  I want the GD effing flag up every morning at Effing Sunrise, Hillary's staff and Arkansas
[16:53.720 --> 16:54.720]  governor's mansion.
[16:54.720 --> 16:55.720]  These are all famous quotes.
[16:55.720 --> 16:59.720]  I've had a lot of these Secret Service, I've talked to two separate Blackwater people,
[16:59.720 --> 17:03.440]  because once I talked to one, I talked to another, I just brought it up and he goes,
[17:03.440 --> 17:06.800]  yeah, no, I've done details for her when she was in the Middle East, and yeah, she would
[17:06.800 --> 17:10.640]  constantly flip out and cuss everybody out, and they bring a dog into her quarters to
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.600]  check, say somebody planted a bomb, she'd go, what the eff is that dog, get that effing
[17:14.600 --> 17:20.720]  and blow up for like 15 minutes screaming, and you talk to somebody else and I go, how
[17:20.720 --> 17:21.720]  did Hillary use to act?
[17:21.720 --> 17:26.920]  Oh, she'd blow up and scream and act crazy, or she'd go into a trance and just sit there
[17:26.920 --> 17:30.720]  for like an hour while they were driving, just looking down and she was a robot.
[17:30.720 --> 17:35.480]  I mean, I probably could get these guys on the air, I mean, they're so sick of her.
[17:35.480 --> 17:38.560]  People call her Blackwater, that's the most evil organization in the world, Blackwater
[17:38.560 --> 17:43.000]  got blamed, and I was even guilty of some of this at the time, for every other mercenary
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.880]  group, including super cheap ones that hire like minimum wage people that aren't even
[17:46.880 --> 17:52.240]  soldiers, literally, out of England is one of the worst groups, and then they got blamed
[17:52.240 --> 17:57.840]  for all other contractors, kind of like Google becomes the name of search engines, you don't
[17:57.840 --> 18:01.240]  say search engines, you say Google, you say mercenaries, you say Blackwater, and I'm
[18:01.240 --> 18:03.880]  certainly not defending prints and some of the stuff that went on.
[18:03.880 --> 18:07.680]  My point is just talking to the Blackwater people I've run into and others, they talk
[18:07.680 --> 18:13.200]  about, because that's who protected the diplomatic details, people like Secretary of State Clinton,
[18:13.200 --> 18:16.400]  she is a fricking monster, and it's well documented.
[18:16.400 --> 18:20.960]  So she's up there, how dare you, you're so despicable, you're so horrible, what you
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.200]  said about women, oh my gosh, I can't believe children are hearing this, and the first question
[18:25.200 --> 18:31.760]  set it up, the Black teacher, she goes, are we going to have appropriate things for tonight,
[18:31.760 --> 18:37.760]  or are you both going to be appropriate people, and Cooper goes, excellent, point, what about
[18:37.760 --> 18:41.800]  your uncoothness, what about your badness to set it all up for Hillary, and notice Stone,
[18:41.800 --> 18:46.880]  had this from a top Democrat, said, when Hillary moves over acting like she's going to shake
[18:46.880 --> 18:51.040]  hands, when Trump extends it, they're not going to shake hands, and notice, Hillary
[18:51.040 --> 18:56.520]  walks up to Trump, he doesn't extend his hand, so she doesn't go there, because it's
[18:56.520 --> 19:01.040]  like that high school joke, or that junior high joke, or middle school joke, where you
[19:01.040 --> 19:05.680]  extend your hand, and then comb your hair with it, and don't shake the person's hand
[19:05.680 --> 19:11.360]  as an act of disrespect, so Trump kept his hand back, she didn't extend her, she came
[19:11.360 --> 19:17.280]  over, we need to get that video, it's at the very start, she came over, wanting him to
[19:17.280 --> 19:23.520]  do it, but it didn't happen, because it was a setup, so they went to plan two, first he
[19:23.520 --> 19:27.840]  was going to ask Hillary, why didn't you shake his hand, well because of what he did to women,
[19:27.840 --> 19:32.600]  I'm a great woman and my daughter, blah blah blah, we're going to skip this break, sorry
[19:32.600 --> 19:38.440]  I forgot to tell you, so much is happening, so much is going on, so much is unfolding,
[19:38.440 --> 19:43.680]  this is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful time to be alive, they are going to pull out
[19:43.680 --> 19:48.160]  all the stops against Trump, but I want to caution everybody, we go up in a motion, we
[19:48.160 --> 19:51.840]  go down in a motion, I go back to everybody so freaked out earlier in the week, it's the
[19:51.840 --> 19:55.040]  most important thing I'm going to say today, out of a whole field of things we're going
[19:55.040 --> 19:59.440]  to cover, the clips we're going to play, and the calls we're going to take, that you have
[19:59.440 --> 20:04.720]  to, I don't mean my audience, but the general public, libertarians, conservatives, patriots,
[20:04.720 --> 20:08.960]  you have to remember when the mainstream media says all the republicans are leaving Trump,
[20:08.960 --> 20:12.960]  Trump's collapsing, Trump's going to resign, Trump's going to give in, it's the end of
[20:12.960 --> 20:18.640]  Trump, they're running a giant perception hoax, now I know you know that, but people
[20:18.640 --> 20:26.080]  still, who are weak minded, buy into it, you've got to explain to them, are you your own person,
[20:26.080 --> 20:29.360]  or do you just go with which way you think the wind's blowing, because the mainstream
[20:29.360 --> 20:35.600]  media doesn't control which way the wind blows, unless you buy into the fraud, and look at it,
[20:35.600 --> 20:42.800]  look at it, take the lemons and turn them to lemonade, the guy made some immature kind of
[20:42.800 --> 20:50.560]  goofy washbush stuff, we all know probably half the guys we talk to, when you're hanging out,
[20:50.560 --> 20:57.840]  say some more stuff, it's just kind of goofy, I just kind of ignore it and move on, I mean I don't
[20:57.840 --> 21:02.000]  really tell people how I eat steaks, I just eat steaks, you know what I mean, so I don't really
[21:02.000 --> 21:09.440]  get into the whole how sausage is made or whatever, but a lot of guys do, and they tell
[21:09.440 --> 21:17.360]  stories, it's like sea stories or fish stories, it's hunting, you know imaginary birds, what's that
[21:18.400 --> 21:23.760]  type of hunting, everybody always tells the kid that hadn't gone hunting, the deck of mountain,
[21:23.760 --> 21:27.760]  the field, or the woods, they say here's a bag, and you run around, you catch the snipe, and then
[21:27.760 --> 21:33.600]  about two hours later, he realizes everybody's run off, and then you tell him, you know, pull back
[21:33.600 --> 21:39.680]  up in the truck, hey buddy, you know, these type of birds don't exist, or it's similar to that,
[21:39.680 --> 21:44.800]  but I'm not going to get caught in that anymore, all I'm saying is, Hillary's an international war
[21:44.800 --> 21:50.480]  criminal involved in every crime, money laundering, funding jihadis, representing child molesters,
[21:50.480 --> 21:55.440]  protecting Bill Clinton's rape and abuse, it goes on and on, he is like a character out of a
[21:55.440 --> 22:01.200]  science fiction horror movie, who's some grave digger or grave robber, he's like the big evil
[22:01.200 --> 22:05.040]  guy that, you know, grabs the kids out of the car, that are kissing in the back seat in the
[22:05.040 --> 22:10.000]  horror movie, and drags them off to, you know, chop them up inside some underground morgue,
[22:10.000 --> 22:18.640]  I mean, I would cast him as a top killer, ghoul, or somebody that an alien's taken over, I mean,
[22:18.640 --> 22:23.760]  look at him, he is the most ghoulish, evil-looking person I've probably ever seen, except for Tim
[22:23.760 --> 22:29.840]  Kane, who looks like a child molester, I'm not saying he's a child molester, but if I was going
[22:29.840 --> 22:35.040]  to cast someone in Hollywood as a creepy guy that goes around and tries to pick kids up, you know,
[22:35.040 --> 22:41.760]  with a creeper astro van, white creeper van, that says free candy and puppies,
[22:45.600 --> 22:51.280]  that's who I would pick, I mean, these are manifestly creepy people, and then you look at
[22:51.280 --> 22:56.560]  Bill Clinton, he's got the whole background, he's got the whole MO, he's got it all, he's got it in
[22:56.560 --> 23:01.520]  spades, flying around on the Lolita Express, 20 plus trips, I kept saying 16 is 20 plus trips,
[23:02.560 --> 23:08.240]  round trips to the pedophile island, flying out on the pedophile plane to the Middle East to meet
[23:08.240 --> 23:15.040]  with a top chic who's in the news as reportedly having harems of boys and girls, I mean, it's well
[23:15.040 --> 23:20.000]  known in some of those Muslim countries, folks, that you're a good-looking woman, and you land,
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.840]  and you walk out of the mall, you're grabbed, you're thrown in the back of a car, because the
[23:23.840 --> 23:28.400]  Sultan, you know, some random Sultan, there's hundreds of them per country, thousands of princes,
[23:28.960 --> 23:34.560]  like Saudi Arabia, you're gone, and you don't ever get seen again, and listen, maybe your family has
[23:34.560 --> 23:38.560]  some money and finds out what's going on and tries to go to the US Embassy, they say, listen,
[23:38.560 --> 23:44.480]  your daughter's gone, she's in a slave pit, okay, that's who Hillary gets hundreds of millions
[23:44.480 --> 23:51.920]  of dollars from, that's who these people are, and so as I told you, there's a dossier out,
[23:51.920 --> 23:56.000]  and it's going to be coming out today, the next few days, where they have Jane Doe's unannounced
[23:56.000 --> 24:03.680]  people and witnesses that are called Jane Doe's and Tiffany Doe's, claiming 22 years ago, Trump,
[24:05.280 --> 24:15.840]  who barely even knew Epstein, raped a teenager, all of it, Jane Doe, Tiffany Doe, this Doe,
[24:15.840 --> 24:22.160]  that Doe, the person that delivered the teenager is the witness in secret given immunity, and it's
[24:22.160 --> 24:28.960]  a judge appointed by Obama in 2011 in the district Hillary Clinton was a US senator,
[24:31.120 --> 24:36.960]  I mean, this is unbelievable, so listen, Trump did the right thing, he came out of the gates,
[24:36.960 --> 24:42.080]  he tore her apart, he told it like it was, the media was never going to leave him alone,
[24:42.080 --> 24:45.280]  they're never going to stop cheating, they're never going to be sweet to him if he just plays
[24:45.280 --> 24:51.280]  along, that's all a hoax, and any advisors telling Trump that are wrong, Trump, you exploded in the
[24:51.280 --> 24:57.200]  polls, Frank once and others said he's not seen basically in his modern political career, someone's
[24:57.200 --> 25:03.360]  numbers spike with focus groups like they did, you went straight up like a Saturn rocket, okay,
[25:05.280 --> 25:09.440]  because everyone hates Hillary, the Democrats hate Hillary, they're all scared of her,
[25:09.440 --> 25:13.120]  they're tired of her, they know how creepy she is, they know how evil she is, they know she's
[25:13.120 --> 25:19.360]  falling down every 20, 30 minutes, and look at the email on dredgerport.com, very top story,
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.960]  New WikiLeaks email Clinton campaign insiders fear Bill Clinton's sex life could sink Hillary,
[25:26.000 --> 25:33.120]  they should shut the hell up about this, Podesta told them, that's in the New WikiLeaks email
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.520]  dump released today, reveals that some Hillary campaign insiders are petrified that Bill Clinton's
[25:37.520 --> 25:43.040]  shorted sexual past could severely damage Hillary's chances, yes, that's why they've cooked it all up
[25:43.040 --> 25:48.720]  throwing on Trump. Oh, this woman was so beautiful, I wanted to take her and buy her furniture, I
[25:48.720 --> 25:55.280]  wanted to date her, oh my gosh, she's so beautiful, oh that's horrible, meanwhile, yes, I'm going to
[25:55.280 --> 26:02.640]  meet with a Sultan now on the pedophile plate, oh, to get $2 million, oh yes, oh yes, oh, Hillary
[26:02.640 --> 26:07.600]  represents pedophiles, these are like demons, unless she's giggling and snickering about it,
[26:07.600 --> 26:12.080]  the revelation is a particular note because it dovetails with Donald Trump holding a press
[26:12.080 --> 26:16.080]  conference yesterday before the debate with three of Bill Clinton's sexual abuse victims
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.880]  and others he jumped on, the email which is marked confidential was sent to the Clinton
[26:22.880 --> 26:28.640]  campaign, Chairman John Podesta by prominent left-wing journalist Brent Bodowski, it includes
[26:28.640 --> 26:33.360]  details of his exchange with someone in the media who told him that there are people close to
[26:33.360 --> 26:40.480]  Clinton's who say William Jefferson Clinton's sex life could be damaging to her, folks, he
[26:40.480 --> 26:46.160]  jumps on women in front of Democrats in ballrooms, he's a total maniac,
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.040]  total maniac, he makes Casanova or Charlie Sheen or
[26:56.160 --> 27:00.640]  the famous guy that played Don Juan, no, who's the famous guy that played,
[27:01.280 --> 27:06.320]  who was the biggest womanizer ever, they said back in those 30s and 40s in Hollywood, no,
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.120]  Errol Flynn, those are women that wanted it though because, you know, it's Errol Flynn,
[27:13.120 --> 27:16.560]  no, no, not with Bill Clinton, man, he will attack you in a second,
[27:19.840 --> 27:24.240]  so it goes on from there, then he's told to basically shut up about it and not talk about it,
[27:25.200 --> 27:28.880]  it's here they aren't scrabbling around trying to cover it up and like just shut up about it,
[27:28.880 --> 27:37.440]  just don't talk about it, so Bill Clinton's on a big power trip, I love the New Ben Garrison
[27:37.440 --> 27:44.080]  cartoon, it's on the bottom right hand corner of info wars.com, the debate souvenir is Hillary
[27:44.080 --> 27:51.680]  Clinton 2017 for prison, and don't you love how the meme that you, the listeners created,
[27:51.680 --> 27:56.960]  sure, we created the first image, we put the idea out, we promulgated Hillary for prison 2016,
[27:56.960 --> 28:02.560]  but now is the year it's long on the tooth, just three months left, little less than three months,
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.720]  you pushed, lock her up, you pushed, put her in prison, you pushed, she was a criminal because
[28:08.720 --> 28:14.320]  she is, and the shoe fits, and now it's out there, and all she can do now is with Homeland
[28:14.320 --> 28:19.520]  Security show the election, if we don't buy the media hoax that he's dropping out, we've seen
[28:19.520 --> 28:23.120]  the last year three times, where they all say he's dropping out, there's an intervention,
[28:23.120 --> 28:27.760]  it's over, the whole party turned against him, and then the who's who of Republican neocons,
[28:27.760 --> 28:32.640]  who all need to be unelected, who were against him before and said you couldn't vote for him,
[28:32.640 --> 28:39.840]  and said they'd ignore you at the convention in Cleveland, all of that got ignored, you figured
[28:39.840 --> 28:46.720]  it out, not once, but twice, now the third time they come out with 28 days out, and they're telling
[28:46.720 --> 28:52.960]  you it's all over because he had some racy talk, oh my gosh, and he went on Howard Stern when he
[28:52.960 --> 28:58.640]  knew he was on there and had racy talk, yes, he's never hidden that he sometimes has racy talk
[28:58.640 --> 29:03.360]  when talking to other guys, I don't want to say it's a cliche of New Yorkers, but you hear a lot
[29:03.360 --> 29:06.960]  of it down here in Texas, you hear some of it in California, you hear some, but I mean, you know,
[29:06.960 --> 29:10.960]  in the kind of the deep south, you hear a lot of talk like that, men don't generally do that,
[29:12.160 --> 29:17.280]  I'm not knocking New Yorkers, I love them, but I'll be in New York at a press deal or whatever at
[29:17.280 --> 29:22.320]  dinner, and people are like, look at her, boy, I'd like to get a piece of that, oh, I'd do anything
[29:22.320 --> 29:26.800]  for her, I mean, that's kind of what goes on, it's kind of funny, big deal, show,
[29:28.480 --> 29:32.080]  defending pedophiles, you know we're guilty, hanging out with sultans that are reportedly
[29:32.080 --> 29:36.880]  pedophiles, flying around on pedophile planes, settling rape cases, oh, that's no big deal,
[29:36.880 --> 29:40.560]  on and on and on, selling us out to jihadis that are running around, murdering women in mass,
[29:40.560 --> 29:45.200]  how to play a bunch of clips, go through it all and chart the path to victory, straight ahead,
[29:45.200 --> 29:49.120]  ladies and gentlemen, but don't let the media hoax you, don't let them mind control you,
[29:49.120 --> 29:56.400]  we're on the march, the empire's on the run, alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.480 --> 30:06.000]  drug raid, 81 year old margaret holcomb was minding her own business in her humble home
[30:06.000 --> 30:11.280]  with her son, when all of the sudden she was part of a full blown drug raid, this wasn't a
[30:11.280 --> 30:17.120]  wrongful raid on an incorrect address, as we've seen in the past, no, no, they caught a fish with
[30:17.120 --> 30:23.520]  this one, literally one fish, after all, margaret had one marijuana plant growing in her backyard
[30:23.520 --> 30:30.400]  garden, get the choppers, get the national guard, take this woman down, the joint raid between the
[30:30.400 --> 30:36.160]  national guard and the massachusetts state police, which also included a military helicopter, was
[30:36.160 --> 30:42.960]  successful and they were able to take down the one marijuana plant, a job well done boys, now
[30:42.960 --> 30:48.320]  margaret will have to find a nice legal pharmaceutical to ease her arthritis and glaucoma,

[32:59.000 --> 33:28.000]  It's Monday, October 10th, 2016, only 28 days left as the world watches the people of the United States attempt to break away from the new world war and global governance, this is self determination 1776 in the year 2016.
[33:30.000 --> 33:53.000]  Donald Trump was channeling the info war last night, obviously we have the right side feed for everybody that didn't want to hear my commentary over line Hillary but they were three against one so I said listen it's two against three, the Cavalry's here on that broadcast some people wanted to hear me screaming over them.
[33:53.000 --> 34:00.000]  One thing we should do is fade her down a little bit when I am talking over because it is kind of grating that's not the cruise fault I should have directed them to do that.
[34:00.000 --> 34:17.000]  But I want to just say something before I get into all the big news here in these clips, the crew, when they were hosting and then when they were hosting after I left at 10 o'clock or so they did another hour and a half was the best radio slash TV I've ever seen on politics.
[34:17.000 --> 34:27.000]  I mean, you've got all these other pundits following talking points from the parties and groups and media combines. Many of them getting direct emails from Hillary on what to say what to do.
[34:27.000 --> 34:43.000]  Comedians, movie stars, anchors, it's all come out in WikiLeaks. So good job WikiLeaks, starting to put some good meat out. I was wrong to go off half cocked, I'm not in the position of Sange's in, I get it, I want to win, I'm tired of these people, he's a smart guy, I genuinely apologize.
[34:43.000 --> 34:54.000]  But he did, I mean, I have the excuse, I am sorry, but I have the excuse that you kept saying it was coming out, you kept saying it would get her indicted.
[34:54.000 --> 35:04.000]  And then you implied it was going to be that day, so I'm up at four in the morning and I'm watching, you know, these boring WikiLeaks reporters, I'm sorry, I got angry.
[35:04.000 --> 35:15.000]  But you have redeemed yourself, thank you WikiLeaks, more, more information, we need more. This woman's dangerous, she wants to launch war with Russia, she said she wants to, these people are out of control.
[35:15.000 --> 35:26.000]  And that's why I'm getting such high level leaks, because Democrats close to Hillary now realize she's mentally ill, she's vicious, she's hateful, she's getting worse.
[35:26.000 --> 35:34.000]  And they are just telling me there's a feeling of doom, a feeling of being in Hitler's bunker was one quote.
[35:34.000 --> 35:45.000]  And we don't know what to do, because this is our job, it's everybody we know, it's like we're in the mafia, and there's just a feeling of doom.
[35:45.000 --> 35:52.000]  And I feel it too, just watching, I mean, that's why I can't sleep with 28 days out.
[35:52.000 --> 35:58.000]  But the crew did an absolutely amazing job, and Trump hit her with everything.
[35:58.000 --> 36:11.000]  I mean, I've said in videos I posted Saturday, I said, he's got to come out and say, how dare you, you're despicable, covering up for the rape of a 12 year old that you represented in Bill settling sexual assault cases.
[36:11.000 --> 36:25.000]  How dare you say my locker room talk, word for word, my locker room talk is a big deal when you've done all these horrible things.
[36:25.000 --> 36:33.000]  And Trump came out and did exactly that, and not because he got it from me, but because he gets it and he understands.
[36:33.000 --> 36:46.000]  And I'm not going to sit there on Friday when everybody's panicking, abandon ship, we're all dead, it's over, oh my God, the mainstream media said it's over, his wife's going to leave him, Pence is going to leave him, it's over.
[36:46.000 --> 36:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've discovered secret Howard Stern tapes, oh, we've got him now, it's live on the radio.
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.000]  Stuff he said 15 years ago, 20 years ago.
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.000]  When you go on Stern, it's a giant audience, people say, why'd you go on that potty mouth show?
[37:04.000 --> 37:16.000]  Because I'm not saying I'm Christ, but you know, Christ went into where the prostitutes were, the money changers, the tax collectors, because he wasn't trying to get the Pharisees, he was trying to get the general public.
[37:16.000 --> 37:24.000]  I've gone on Stern and his subnetworks many times because we get big listeners from it.
[37:24.000 --> 37:36.000]  All the time I see people on the street, I never knew my name until I heard you on Stern, I heard you on Stern, I woke up, I want my friends up, it changed my whole life, I got off Prozac, blah, blah, blah.
[37:36.000 --> 37:46.000]  I've probably had 500 people come up to me and say they learned about the show from Howard Stern, probably more, it's like almost every time I go out in public, somebody comes over about Howard Stern, it's a big show.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  He goes on there, you sit there where Stern goes, so would you first have sex, so would you do this, so would you do that?
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  I'm a real person, I'm not hiding, I'm like 12 years old.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  Oh, you were abused? No, she was 16, I loved it.
[37:58.000 --> 38:10.000]  And it's not because I'm a pottymouth, that's the tell-all show, sure I'll go on there, but I said after five minutes of that I said, now let's move on to fluoride in the water, let's move on to how the fish are becoming sterile, while the sperm's becoming sterile.
[38:10.000 --> 38:19.000]  He's laughing the whole time, but I'm waking people up, millions of them.
[38:19.000 --> 38:36.000]  And I was told later, higher-ups said, Stern rarely, as people tell him, don't have folks on, I was told, people said, man, we had the highest ratings, he said it the next week, he said, we had the highest listenership and the highest positive response to Alex of any guest we've ever had, 86% positive.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  They had a poll, they said, I've never seen anything like it.
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.000]  Did you ever be back on Stern himself? No, they put me on their sub-channels and then they said, yeah, we've been gotten crackdowns on that, we're not, can't have you on anymore.
[38:46.000 --> 38:53.000]  That's fine. The point is, the enemy didn't want me on there because I was having a big effect.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  Other big shows get bucked when I come on.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  They have to put their jobs on the line to have me on.
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.000]  George Norrie's done that. It's got a lot of courage.
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.000]  And when I'm on there, executives are watching, looking for one mistake to burn him.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  There's some good people there too, but there's a takeover in the media.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  There's a takeover in Talk Radio Happens, a takeover at Fox.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  I told you, I know all the inside baseball, I can't say a lot of it here on air.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  I know the savage stuff, I know the clear channel stuff, I know the cumulus stuff.
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  Basically, I know it all, okay? And it's bad, okay?
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  We run our own operation here. That's what they cannot stand.
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.000]  GCN is just our satellite provider. God bless them, they're great folks.
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  But it's mom and pop.
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  And I don't want to get into myself anymore, but we're all interconnected.
[39:43.000 --> 39:51.000]  You're interconnected. And I have to let you, the audience, know what we're going through, what we're dealing with.
[39:51.000 --> 39:57.000]  If something horrible comes out and Trump comes out and agrees he did it,
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.000]  I will then weigh it. But there's, I'm never a lesser of two evils person.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  But with Hillary, there's not even the same universe.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  I mean, she is an abject psychopathic demon from hell
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  that as soon as she gets into power is going to try to destroy the planet.
[40:10.000 --> 40:16.000]  I'm sure of that. And people around her say she's so dark now and so evil and so possessed
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  that they are having nightmares. They're freaking out.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  Folks, let me just tell you something. If Mitty wants to go with this, that's fine.
[40:23.000 --> 40:30.000]  There are dozens of videos and photos of Obama having flies land on him indoors at all times of year
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  and he'll be next to 100 people and no one has flies on him.
[40:33.000 --> 40:40.000]  Hillary reportedly, I mean, I was told people around her that they think she's demon possessed.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say it. Okay, they said they're scared.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  That's why when I see her when kids are by her, I actually get scared myself for the child.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  I mean, use that big rubber face and that, I mean, this woman is dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:54.000 --> 41:05.000]  I'm telling you, she is a demon. This is biblical. She's going to launch a nuclear war.
[41:05.000 --> 41:11.000]  The Russians are scared of her. By the way, when people are scared of you and they have nuclear weapons,
[41:11.000 --> 41:21.000]  you have a big war. When you're scared, you fight. When you're a man, you don't crawl in the hole
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  and stick your butt out the other end so the wolf can eat it. You fight.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  And I'm going to tell the Democrats something and all the trendies, all the rest of you.
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  You've lived on the guts of your ancestors. You've lived off what was built before.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  You don't appreciate anything. You're pseudo-intellectuals that think you know everything.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  I've been around you. You are despicably sad and pathetic people.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  I'm going to consider and kiss your ass.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  If you want to redeem yourself, then admit Donald Trump's right.
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  Admit he's a lion with a bunch of jackals attacking him and hyenas. Stand up for what's right.
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.000]  Admit the entire power structure you claim you're not part of is against him.
[41:55.000 --> 42:02.000]  And then ask yourself why you want to be part of this delusion club, the delusionites, the delusionals,
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.000]  where you think you're a winner and you think everything's okay because you said so.
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.000]  You're living in your own world. I know I'm right.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  And this is a fight against the hoax machine. It's a fight against the mainstream media.
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  It's a fight against globalism. It's a fight against all the corruption we've seen.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  The Republican Party establishment, the Bushes, the mass graves, the dead children, the sanctions, the wars.
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  I mean, Trump last night was so genuine. You can tell you got down to real Trump last night
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  when she's like, you're with the Russians. He goes, I don't even know the Russians.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  I have nothing to do with the Russians. But why would we want to have a war with them?
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  They're not doing anything to us. We need you to link up and defeat radical Islam with them.
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  And she's the one launching the modern jihad. She knows full well, here he is.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  Trying to stop World War III. Hillary and her people are trying to start a war with Russia.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  They admit they are. They're trying to overthrow it internally.
[42:57.000 --> 43:03.000]  The Soros's group. It's on record. And there's this guy going, yeah.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  Yeah, okay. Yeah, I don't want to have war with Russians. I mean, I work for them.
[43:06.000 --> 43:12.000]  What's your problem? You're a despicable person.
[43:12.000 --> 43:17.000]  She sleeps in the same room with that creepy weirdo woman.
[43:17.000 --> 43:24.000]  Uma Abedin, whose mother wears a hood over her head and writes top articles in the world
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  promoting, cutting women's genitals off. What the hell?
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  That woman number one's ugly and evil. But imagine if you're like, oh, what does your mom do?
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.000]  Oh, she's a top genital mutilation pusher. I'd be like, whoa, you're, get the hell away from me.
[43:39.000 --> 43:47.000]  Again, the Hillary's into like creepy, weird, sick stuff, man.
[43:47.000 --> 43:53.000]  Just disgusting with flies all over, big, fat, stinking, imagine how bad she smells, man.
[43:53.000 --> 44:02.000]  I'm told her and Obama just stink, stink, stink, stink. You can't wash that evil off, man.
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.000]  I'm told there's a rotten smell around Hillary. I'm not kidding. People say, they say the folks,
[44:07.000 --> 44:13.000]  I've been told this by high up folks. They say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[44:13.000 --> 44:18.000]  I never said this because the media go crazy with it, but I've talked to people that are in protective details.
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.000]  I mean, they're scared of her and they say, listen, she's a frickin' demon and she stinks.
[44:23.000 --> 44:30.000]  And so does Obama. I go like, what? Sulfur. They smell like hell.
[44:30.000 --> 44:36.000]  I mean, I hate to go down this road, folks, but I'm telling you, we're dealing with demons here.
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  All right? Look at what they do. They go out of their way to do evil things.
[44:39.000 --> 44:48.000]  They keep babies alive and sell their body parts. They involve themselves in every form of wickedness you can imagine.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  But it's not like flies are landing on them a few times.
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  I mean, if I'm out in the woods doing coverage, sometimes a fly will land.
[44:54.000 --> 45:00.000]  We're talking about in the middle of events, in the middle of the White House, in the middle of luncheons in Germany.
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  No one else has flies on them and there's just flies landing all over them.
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.000]  Okay, I'm going to stop there. I'm going to use these clips because these are epic clips.
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.000]  I need to get to them.
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  There is so much unfolding.
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.000]  We're going to get a whole bunch of clips here in just a moment, but we do have Trump on Russia right now.
[45:20.000 --> 45:24.000]  Let's start with some of the clips. Since I mentioned that one, let's just start there.
[45:24.000 --> 45:32.000]  I don't know, Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together as an example, but I don't know, Putin.
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.000]  But I notice anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say, the Russians, the Russians, you don't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  Maybe there is no hacking, but they always blame Russia.
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia, I know nothing about Russia.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.
[45:51.000 --> 45:56.000]  I don't deal there. I have no businesses that have no loans from Russia. I don't know, Putin.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  I think it would be great if we got along with Russia.
[46:00.000 --> 46:06.000]  There you go. Russia has two and a half military bases.
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  By that, they have one place they're able to fuel with ships, but it's not a base.
[46:09.000 --> 46:15.000]  So I think two and a half because you can argue three or two. I went and looked into it. There's two and a half.
[46:15.000 --> 46:22.000]  The U.S. has 200 plus permanent bases, several hundred other sub bases, and over 700.
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.000]  They still call them cooling stations, but it's where they get fuel and supply.
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  We're over a thousand bases at that point.
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  Russia is not expansionist. Sorry.
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.000]  You know who is China because they've been given the deal worldwide on basically all economic activity.
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.000]  Panama Canal, all the deepwater ports, 97% of Earth minerals.
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  You don't think we couldn't be getting those? They've been given them.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  It's a global deal. It's admitted. They're allowed to have tariffs on us.
[46:51.000 --> 46:57.000]  Higher corporate tax to make sure, I mean lower corporate tax to keep us high, to screw us.
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.000]  This is globalism. This is their deal. This is economic warfare by the corporate elite.
[47:02.000 --> 47:08.000]  Trump wants to end that. And you fools, and I'm not talking to our audience, but the people that make jokes,
[47:08.000 --> 47:16.000]  you know, you know you've bet on pure evil. You know that you're wrong.
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  Now, I'm going to get to some more of these clips.
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  I want to go back to the first one because I've got like 15 of them. They're so amazing.
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  Then we'll open the phones up and take your phone calls.
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  Trump threatens to prosecute Clinton. She's going to be in jail.
[47:28.000 --> 47:38.000]  Trump steamrolls Bill Clinton's past behavior with women, CNN caught coaching, undercover voter panel.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  We've got so much coming up. But before I do that, we need to refuel this operation.
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  You heard me skip a break earlier. That's expensive, but I'm just so on fire.
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  We're going to end the Hill River prison shirts in 28 days. Everybody else can still make them or whatever.
[47:51.000 --> 47:59.000]  These are the originals. They're 1995. We need to make, you know, the 15 bucks off this to fund this operation.
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  The reporters, the crew, the crew we had there covering it. This is very expensive.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  We run this from Texas. I couldn't do this if I was in New York or LA.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  I mean, we'd be a third of the size. By God's blessing, we ended up here.
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  That's where I'm from and we're able to do it. It's all worked organically.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  But we need to make some serious money around here to fund these operations.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  We need to get a lot of money in here. So everybody, you already got a shirt, get another one.
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  There's a war. You know it. You know where the tip of the spear.
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.000]  You know, we are the now, the national talking point memo against the new world order along with Drudge.
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.000]  It's drudging in full wars are the tip of the spear. Everybody else is right behind us.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  Believe me, I want them to get bigger than us, man. I don't like being the main target.
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  We have another limited edition. Don't tread on me with a Gadgeton snake wrapped around Hillary on the back.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  It says lock her up. That's a limited edition. We're only doing this run of them.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  They're almost sold out by the way.
[48:44.000 --> 48:52.000]  We've got the DNA force, 23% off amazing with the bio qq, the bio pqq, the coq 10, all of it.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  The ultimate formula. Amazing discount right now.
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  We also have our new probiotic biome defense. We have 25 million live culture bottle.
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.000]  That is half the price of the one that's 50 million per pill.
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.000]  And this comes with a cold pack with it. This is the highest quality.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  There are competing nutraceuticals sold by doctors. They're not prescriptions, but doctors sell them that are 100, 150 bucks.
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  There are some brands that aren't even as good at Whole Foods for $80, 90, $100.
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  So we have this for what $40 and for 60 something dollars.
[49:23.000 --> 49:32.000]  Very expensive for us to produce. The profit we make funds this operation in full wars life.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.000]  And I'm going to tell you something else. Our radio crew, our TV crew, our writers, our reporters,
[49:37.000 --> 49:44.000]  our backup people that run this operation. They've been working on salary 18 hours a day.
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.000]  And I say volunteer if you want, I'm going to work 18 hours a day, six, seven days a week until this is over.
[49:50.000 --> 49:57.000]  And you know what? I come up here sometimes at like three o'clock on a Saturday and people are already here fighting and working without me.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  And they don't even want the money, but a lot of them aren't paid that much because we don't have that big a budget.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  I want to give them a big bonus.
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  I know a lot of you want a bonus too. This economy is in trouble, but you're funding fighting back to get our republic.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  Believe me, he cuts taxes by 50% like he's about to do.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  Economy is going to explode.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  More receipts are going to come in. They're going to make more money too.
[50:17.000 --> 50:21.000]  He does some simple things. Boom time is coming. Boom time.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  We need to get the ball across the goal line.
[50:24.000 --> 50:30.000]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, recall toll free 888-253-3139.
[50:30.000 --> 50:35.000]  We have Biotru Selenium. I was getting really tired of being on air five hours last night.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  I didn't pop a brain force. They work great, but it keeps me up at night.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  I popped a Biotru Selenium and an hour later was just incredible energy.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  Selenium is electrochemical. It's one of the key things in the body. You die without it.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  It's one of the biggest game changers out there.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  We have the purest form from mustard seed, totally organic over the top.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.000]  It will knock you into the next level. I mean, it's incredible. Get that to infowarslife.com. We'll be back.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  Stop burying items underground or wrapping them in aluminum foil.

[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  Dr. Lara Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  He also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells.
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  He discovered the one prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency.
[52:11.000 --> 52:18.000]  Dr. Joanna Budwig built upon the work of Dr. Warburg and discovered how to feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency.
[52:18.000 --> 52:26.000]  She found that it was a sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would become emulsified and more readily absorbed.
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.000]  Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of the body.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality, zero oxidation, undamaged seed oils.
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  The results on these seed oils alone are amazing.
[52:40.000 --> 52:50.000]  In fact, our life force enhanced one-world-way protein powder that is much higher in the sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is and you have a winning combination to confer health and energy like never before.

[53:44.000 --> 53:51.000]  Oil spills, air pressure is never at the store. What are you going to do when a zombie's at your door?
[53:51.000 --> 53:59.000]  New manna, new manna, run organically. America made just for you. Food stores all love to eat. Yum!
[54:03.000 --> 54:11.000]  We're back. You know, I had a former national delegate of the Democrats on when 96 was at the DNC in Illinois in Chicago.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  He was a fellow that took over the Tim Kaine event and did the best job screaming,
[54:15.000 --> 54:23.000]  Bill Clinton's a rapist and wearing the shirt. And he described Hillary on the internal video screens to the people screaming,
[54:23.000 --> 54:30.000]  F-U and go to hell and all this stuff. I mean, she does this reportedly constantly. She's totally psychotic.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  I was just told something by the IT folks. We have a new upgraded digital phone system.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  It tells us how many calls we get and how many busy signals.
[54:36.000 --> 54:47.000]  And obviously it's folks trying back over and over again. 23,000 calls last night when we opened the phones up at like 10 o'clock at night central.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  CJ, tell us about this.
[54:49.000 --> 54:59.000]  So basically the new system is able to answer calls and instead of giving somebody a busy tone and putting them on hold,
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.000]  they get a busy tone automatically and don't clog up a phone system.
[55:03.000 --> 55:08.000]  So although we were only able to take a couple dozen calls, we got 23,000.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  I think it was roughly 14,000 an hour.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  And by the way, they were the best callers I ever heard.
[55:12.000 --> 55:18.000]  Daytime callers had to be half asleep or a lot of times out of work or take the day off and have nights off.
[55:18.000 --> 55:24.000]  Or they're making beer or whatever. But we have some great callers here in the day, but we always get better ones at night.
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.000]  And that's why I really should just say first time callers and get folks on who aren't just waiting to the second I send the number and call in
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  because the callers were so amazing last night. I mean, I'm telling you, I was so proud.
[55:34.000 --> 55:40.000]  And I left here after doing six hours at 1030 and I was driving home and I just sat there in the parking lot at my house
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  because my kids were already asleep for an hour listening to you guys.
[55:43.000 --> 55:49.000]  And it was just so seamless, so on target, so smart, so original, so on target.
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  I love you guys. I love this crew. I love our reporters.
[55:52.000 --> 55:58.000]  I didn't usually talk like this. We've had some decent crews, but this is the crew. I love you. You understand that?
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  Yes, we can fill love.
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  Oh man, this is awesome. I mean, we're making history. We're doing the right thing.
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  I'm so blessed that God put me in this position and that I'm not evil like the Clintons. I feel sorry for the folks.
[56:10.000 --> 56:15.000]  They are so evil. It is such an honor to be fighting these people. I am so blessed.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  I just, it's amazing to me. It really is amazing that we've come this far. God's promise is so incredible.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  And I'm so thankful for all of you.
[56:23.000 --> 56:29.000]  Donald Trump has a good heart. It's so evident when he could just say he hates Russia and they put him in office.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  But he's like, I don't want to attack people that didn't do stuff to us.
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  Russia does one thing. He'll go after him.
[56:35.000 --> 56:42.000]  The globalists are starting wars. They're evil. They're putting radical Islamics in to kill Christians and others.
[56:42.000 --> 56:49.000]  They're bad people. They're demonic. The devil and the Bible is known as the Lord of the Flies.
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  Okay, I've got all these clips and I just have been so excited to the sour. I haven't got to a lot of them.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  Let's, let's, let's in the shower with the way I started it. And then we're going to come back and play clip after clip.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  Give the phone number out. Take your phone calls.
[57:01.000 --> 57:09.000]  But this, this was an epic moment and folks, they're going to show up with women on TV.
[57:09.000 --> 57:15.000]  And it'll be so obvious. They'll even work for the Clintons or something. It's like this judge, you know, put in by Obama.
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  Openly supported by the Clintons in Clinton's district in New York.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  And then now he's letting people with Jane Doe's say that he, one lady that he raped her 22 years ago.
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  I mean, it's going to get worse than that folks. It's going to get worse than that because these are evil people.
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  I have to accuse him of what they've done. They know Trump was getting ready to expose the Epstein stuff.
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.000]  They know that was the battle plan and stone told him a year ago, do it now because they're going to cook it up on you.
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  Even though you've only been to one of his parties during the day and we're there 30 minutes.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  He's talked about this a year ago. You've got to do this.
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.000]  Donald, he said, oh, they won't do that. Yes, they are. He just can't believe they're doing this.
[57:55.000 --> 58:00.000]  But now he's taking the gloves off because he has to.
[58:00.000 --> 58:07.000]  So get ready folks that they may kill him too. And how are you going to feel when you've been talking about about Donald Trump when he's in so much danger?
[58:07.000 --> 58:12.000]  So when we come back, I've got like 15 clips. We're going to play them all. We're going to talk about them.
[58:12.000 --> 58:17.000]  We're going to break it down. But now is the time to pray for Donald Trump.
[58:17.000 --> 58:21.000]  Now is the time to donate. Now is the time to spread the word, but more important than donating.
[58:21.000 --> 58:28.000]  Talk to your friends and family if you're in one of these 10 battleground states, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Colorado, places like that.
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.000]  Because they're not going to try to steal them in states where it's obvious, but they're going to engage in election fraud.
[58:33.000 --> 58:39.000]  We have to let everybody know Donald Trump's going to win by a landslide. Look for the steal. Stay with us. We'll be back.
[58:39.000 --> 58:49.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:09.000 --> 59:14.000]  The election systems have now developed alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home or office.
[59:14.000 --> 59:20.000]  You owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[59:20.000 --> 59:28.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[59:28.000 --> 59:34.000]  The general public doesn't. The alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[59:34.000 --> 59:40.000]  None of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[59:40.000 --> 59:44.000]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[59:44.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's alex jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  When you experience providence in your life and you have a dream that really upsets you as a waking dream,
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  special dreams, and then a month later what you saw in the dream happens exactly as you were in the dream.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  You know there's a lot going on in this universe, don't you? You've all had those type of events.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  But I look at my life and all the things that happened to me, the good, the bad, the ugly, it was all building what I've done for 20 plus years on the air,
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  all of it building towards the time we're in, all the skills, all the background, all of it clicking right when it was needed in God's plan.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  It's so humbling to be associated with all you the listeners and to be in this fight.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  It brings tears of joy to my eyes and I'm somebody that didn't even use to cry at my grandparents' funerals.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  And now the energy level is so high. It's amazing.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  I think they're going to try to kill Trump or they're going to have an assassination attempt on Hillary in the next week or two.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  All hell's going to break loose. Get ready. If she gets in, she's going to watch a war with Russia for sure. She is demonic.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  And everybody can feel it, including Democrats that are around her.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  And if anybody's got self-preservation instincts in them, if you've got any spirit left in you folks, you've got to know Hillary Clinton and the Bush Clinton crime machine must be stopped.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  That's why I've told her the gloves are off, brass knuckles are on. I know that all that matters is I throw myself every ounce of energy, every ounce of my will, all my blood, all my treasure, my family, everything.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  I put it all on the line and I ask God to carry us the rest of it.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  Everything I am, everything I'll ever be.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  I want to set our wills against these people. That's what God wants you to do, is to set your will against them and never surrender, never give up, never back down.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  I look at the public. They're starting to wake up. Do you know the media lies? You know they twist. You know they create these petty events. They think you're small and stupid.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  And then still people somewhat buy into it. Not as much, but now if they do everything they can and do it just right, they're able to still kind of hoax a little bit.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  And then Trump, only when he's desperate, does the right thing and goes into the fray.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  We have to go like one of the most famous Samurais. I put this all the time. You pull it up, the way of the Samurai is desperate.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Please print me off that, please. And the arena. I want to read those. I just hang them on the wall. And it doesn't mean desperate like you're afraid.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  A coward thinks desperateness is like hiding and pissing on yourself. Desperateness is just completely turning loose.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  And that might mean total precision. That might mean out of control, berserking. It just means getting in your center and just saying, I'm not thinking about it. I'm doing it.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  I'm not thinking about, I'm going to kick your ass. I'm going to beat your brains out. It's happening now.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  We're going to run over evil. And there's going to be other fights. But I'm telling you, these churches have been run by the globalists for a long time.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  They've taught you to stand down. They've taught you it's the end of the world.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  It might be. The point is, God's not going to recognize you if you don't stand up against evil now and hide out in these demonic churches.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  I can't go in these big churches. I'm a sensitive person. And I got the Willys. Everybody does in the Roman Coliseum. I got the Willys in the Vatican.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  I get worse Willys in these big mainline churches that I got in the Coliseum at Rome.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  That's because most of these big preachers you see are globalist agents and they hold a satanic office.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  It's one thing to be evil, but when you pose as a man of Christ and you aren't, it's the most demonic thing there is.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Donald Trump never claims to be perfect, never claims. Are you Christians? Yes, I like God.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  But it's private with him. And then he's ashamed of things he does. So he doesn't want to say it. I see all of them.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Compare these people to talk about how good they are all day and they're screwing kids at night.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Let me tell you, a lot of these big preachers in your town, they're raping kids at night and they're in satanic covens. You need to know that.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  These big mega churches are Satan. They're devil worshiping pits. We'll be back.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  With fewer than 30 days to go before the US presidential election, the Revolution underway in America mirrors the referendum that happened a few months ago in Great Britain, led by Nigel Farage.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  This referendum led by Donald Trump is a war waged against Wall Street, the globalist and the political elites in this country.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  Farage recently weighed in on Trump saying that his remarks that stirred up such a fuss this week were nothing more than alpha male boasting and pointed out that his American counterpart isn't running to be Pope.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  Americans need a leader, a fighter, one that stands up like Trump did last night and historically took off the gloves when attacking Clinton.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  On one line, we'll go down in history from last night's debate, Trump called out Clinton on her law-breaking and said that if he were president, she'd be in jail.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  America's Brexit is in full force and it's up to the American people to exercise the same strength our British counterparts did and no longer act as puppets for the globalist agenda.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  Hi, yeah, first of all, I want to say, secret 12, act 2, supermale, brain force, prostigar, silver bullet. I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work. Buy info.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  Thank you, brother.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  Welcome to the Infowar.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Infowar at the same time.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Cascio FX, Nation Iodine.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  All right. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  What products are you taking?
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Everything from supermale to brain force to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  Number one, when you choose Autoship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for Autoship
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  because we hold back a surplus for Autoship customers.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  Just go to infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on Autoship
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new Autoship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  10% off on Autoship. Win, win, win at infowarslife.com.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for Autoship.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  Lines fall on my facing hands. Lines fall from the ups and downs.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  All right, I'm going to discipline myself now and get to all these clips.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  Then your phone calls.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  Steve Pachett wants to pop in. He always has important things to say.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  I don't know his view on the debate last night.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  I'll suspect he's going to say devastating victory.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  And what we should see constantly from Trump.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Trump was misadvised and I'm not going to attack people that advise him. I know who did it.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  Through back channels that Hillary wasn't going to attack him and play nice.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  And because he wanted to honor members of his family, Trump was nice in the first debate and it was a giant miscalculation.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  Gloves are off. Brass knuckles are on. He knows he's been betrayed. He knows they're coming for him.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  He tried to not go in the gutter. He is going to absolutely battleax them now.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  And we have to, too.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  That's why we started the Hillary for president lock her up movement.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  It's why we're doing the whole rape movement and why people have them under siege.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  There were Bill Clinton is a rapist wanted Bill Clinton rapist signs all over the event.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  I'm going to have a bunch of PDFs made by my crew and put it on a Bill Clinton rape page on him for words.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  You can download our PDFs we're making using the epic iconic image of him threateningly looking at the rape victims sitting to him near him in the audience.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  There's one thing to have him with the image stone may which is fine Bill Clinton smiling.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  No, we're going to have him when he has his rapist eyes bulging out.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Can we put him big behind me from drugs report and info wars?
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  Can we blow this up a little behind me because that's what I want.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  That's the iconic image. That's what he did.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  We're slowing it down right now.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  We have some other angles to have him and Hillary freaking out during it and Hillary's response.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  We're going to put them side by side.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  This image tells of 10 million words.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  So that's all coming up.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  But I was talking about desperateness.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  Not the way people think of desperateness like cowardly desperateness.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  But the desperateness of a woman picking up a 2,000 pound car off her baby.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  It's been seen by police firefighters who name it.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  It's been documented.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  It's been caught on tape.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  We all have a governor. We suppress it.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  In times like these get rid of the governor.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  Control yourself but focus those tidal energies God gave you.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  Lord Noshogi said the way of the samurai is desperateness.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  10 men or more cannot kill such a man.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Common sense will not accomplish great things.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  Simply becoming insane and desperate is the way of the samurai.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  If one uses discrimination he will fall behind.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  One needs neither loyalty nor devotion but simply to become desperate in the way.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Loyalty and devotion are of themselves within desperation.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  I'm a loyal person.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  I'm a real person.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  I'm desperate.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  The enemy knows it.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  Why she calls me dark art because I'm the opposite.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  I'm so loving.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  She knows I have no fear of her because I am loving.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  I am good.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  I know evil when I see it.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  And I know Hillary is desperate and afraid in her own way.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  But she's so into herself her desperateness doesn't give her power.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Desperateness to yourself is weakness.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Desperateness to defend the weak is chivalry.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  But you don't know that do you?
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  You claim you have the moral high ground all day and you love everyone so much
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  when you're horrible pig people that steal furniture and plates from the White House
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  and who think you're God, you're not.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  You're not humble.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  The devil sticking a big fat apple in your mouth right now and firing up that furnace.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  And when God gives the word, you're going to get slid right in there.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Face first.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  So enjoy.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  It's your party.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  You set it up.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  It's your tree.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  You're sitting in it.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Enjoy.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  Eternity's big and it's endless.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  It's filled with people like you who want to be together.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  That's all hell is.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  People like you want to be together.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and start with the clips.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  Let's begin at the beginning.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Trump threatens to prosecute Clinton at the end says you need to be in jail.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  This is beyond historical because it's so true.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  It's devastating.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  It's what everybody already knows.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  And he's just signaling the truth for everyone and they can't stop the signal.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  It's amazing.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Here it is.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it and I hate to say it.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  There has never been anything like it and we're going to have a special prosecutor.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  When I speak, I go out and speak the people of this country are furious.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  In my opinion, the people that have been long term workers at the FBI are furious.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  There has never been anything like this where emails and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails and then you acid wash them
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  or bleach them as you would say a very expensive process.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  So we're going to get a special prosecutor and we're going to look into it because you know what?
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  People have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you have done
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  and it's a disgrace and honestly you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  You know, it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  is not in charge of the law in our country.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  Oh, you need to be in charge because you've got such a great temperament.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  Now we have Trump getting into Bill Clinton's past behavior when Hillary has the nerve
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  to bring up to him that he had some locker room taught
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  that's obviously highly edited as well.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  This is incredible. So we'll play that club.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, Trump says the campaign has changed him.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  When did that happen?
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  So Mr. Trump, let me add to that when you walked off that bus at age 59,
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  And you have two minutes for this.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  That was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  and certainly I'm not proud of it but that was something that happened.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words and his was action.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  His was what he's done to women, there's never been anybody in the history of politics
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  So you can say any way you want to say it but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  One of the women who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old was raped at 12.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  Her client, she represented, got him off and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions,
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  laughing at the girl who was raped.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  So don't tell me about words.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  Put her in a coma.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  Absolutely, I apologize for those words.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  I have daughters.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  But it is things that people say.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago,
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  I think it's disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  And then he goes on, there's another extra little jiblet, but this is powerful.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  And he can get even more serious now, but notice I was freaking out five minutes into it.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  He was letting Hillary attack, attack, attack.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  It was staged up with Cooper, first stage question about morals.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  He wasn't doing anything.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  He was apologizing, but he let him just keep attacking.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  They did three rounds of attacks and I was just screaming, attack, attack, attack.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  And I knew I was right about Trump.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  I know he's not a shill.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  And I was like, how can my instinct, my gut be wrong?
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  I'm going to skip this break coming up.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  I got so upset and then boom, he did it just right.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  Which again, I was questioning him.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  I need to learn that I don't know everything.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  All of us do.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  That if my gut tells me he's, he's, he's, God's with him and my gut tells me I need to be with Trump,
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  that he's going to do the right thing.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  My gut tells me, folks, if my gut ever tells me to turn against Trump, I'll turn against him.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  My gut's never wrong.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  Your gut's not wrong either, folks, just go with it.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  But God gave it to you.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  Your brain communicates with you when you're not listening.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  The subconscious has the nerves right to your guts and then that's the bigger part of your brain.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  That's a hundred, 200 times more powerful and it knows.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  That's where your soul's at too.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Donald's great escape.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  Trump keeps his campaign alive with barnstorming comeback after confronting Hillary with four of Clinton's sex victims
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  and she fails to nail him over sleazy tape scandal.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  Sleazy.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  Talk about wanting to buy a woman a bunch of furniture.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  It's all edited.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  He goes, oh, and then she was married.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  You can tell that was early on why you couldn't go out with her.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  It's clearly edited.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  We need to take that waveform, the original show, folks, because I know I can hear it.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  How the background noise goes up and down.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  See, if you're in a bus and it's not edited, it's just going to be one continual deal.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  But I'm not going to get obsessed with that.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  There's just so much happening right now.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  This is so huge.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  Let's go to another clip here.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  Let's go ahead and play, because this is important.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  Let's go ahead and play.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  I've got so many of these clips.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  I don't know where to go here.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  Let's go.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  Clinton and moderators gang up on Trump.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  He calls them out.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  And then we have a Trump campaign video they put out pointing this out.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  But let's go ahead and play Clinton and the moderators.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  Look, we play on this work.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  They got Cooper and Rat teamed up on him.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  I'm helping Donald, okay?
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  I'd like to know.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  Why are you going to other stuff and just have to feed?
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  But they're three-hands-one.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  It's two against three now.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  Jim Carpoy says the question.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  Nice to.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  One on three.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  There you go.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  Donald gets it.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  One on three.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  Boom, baby.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  Two against three.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Yes.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  It is not affordable.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  Americanism, not globalism.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  There was a lot of that last night where I'd say something he said right after.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  Talk about things.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  I mean, obviously he didn't talk to me.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  This isn't coming.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  His responses last night are all his.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  And then they're with me.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Anyways, let's go ahead and go to the next clip here.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  This is what the campaign put out.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  Showing how they were all ganged up on him to prove this.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  Here it is.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  Mr. Stevens.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  Six.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  I mean, I think we should be allowed to.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  No.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  Mr. Trump, we're going to go on.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  This is about the audience.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Please go.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  Allow her to respond, please.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  Personally, what do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  I think Aleppo is a disaster humanitarian.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  What do you think will happen if it falls?
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  How stupid is our country?
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  There are sometimes reasons the military does that.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  Psychological warfare.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  I can't think of any.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  I can't think of any.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  It might be to help get the billions out.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  We're getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  We have to move on.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  Secretary Clinton, you can respond when we've got more time.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  We want to give the audience a chance here.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Mr. Trump, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  Secretary Clinton, you can respond.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  We have to move on to an audience question.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  Mr. Trump, I want to get on this.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  I just want to just one thing.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Every $15,000.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  Please allow her to respond.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  No, it hasn't.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  It hasn't.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  And it hasn't been finished.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  He got less time.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  Interrupted him like 100 times.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  It's nice to, one on three.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  There you go.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  And so with our feed, I'm going to sit here and just point out, she's liar.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  I don't avoid taxes.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  She's all these secret bank accounts.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  Warren Buffett is the biggest beneficiary.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  His company got $438 billion.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  That's the McClatchy headline.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  That was years ago.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  It's more now.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  He personally got $20 billion that he then puts in a tax exempt fund and then takes the
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  money back out.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  Then he says to people that don't know how finance works, I'm a rich guy and I don't
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  pay enough taxes, raise taxes on rich people.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  He means people making $50,000 or more now.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  Oh yeah, Hillary wants to raise it on middle-class folks and blue-collar people.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  I see people not being able to pay for gas, buy their kids food and tennis shoes.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  It pisses me off.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  I want prosperity.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  These people admit they want to make you poor.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  That's their plan.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  That's why I hate them.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  If I'm in a cafeteria because I like going to blue-collar places like Lubies and I see
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  old ladies in there that are scrimping and can't buy food, I don't like to make a big
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  deal out, but I go to the front and pay for their food and I start crying because 10 years
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  ago, people were able to buy themselves food.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  God, these people are so evil.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  Why can't America wake up and beat them?
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  Donald Trump's not perfect, but he doesn't want to hurt you and your family.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  Hillary and Obama want to make you poor and pathetic.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  We have all their white papers.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  They hate you.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  They hate prosperity.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  They hate God.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  They hate children and goddamn them to hell.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  We're going to find the lever to beat these people and they're going to be beaten.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  Excuse me.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  I just get so emotional.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  Look at her sharp face.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  Have a look at her with that demon face.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  That's a freaking demon.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  We're going to have President Linda Blair people and I'm not going to go along with it.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  Excuse me.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Let's go to a clip of David Knight breaking down the honest Abe.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  He said what he wanted about Abraham Lincoln.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  He was neurotic about owning nothing.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  He was into all sorts of weird stuff and never lying.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  But he would talk to one group from their perspective and other group.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  That's not lying.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  Hillary's caught in emails talking about lying to people.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  She turns that into honest Abe Lincoln.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  Who was the opposite of her?
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  He was a spiritualist.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  He was into weird Rosa Crucian stuff.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  He was owned basically nothing.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  When he died, he had a comb and one cup and a knife and a fork in two suits.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Abraham Lincoln is the polar opposite of Hillary Clinton scrounging, buying crap,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  having rotting mansions everywhere.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Abraham Lincoln grew up in a one room log cabin.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  You grew up as the daughter of the Chicago mob boss.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  Oh yeah, you didn't know that.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  It's well known.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  The horror media won't tell you.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  Let's play this clip.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  Look, now she's blaming.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  She got caught in a total lie.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  And she said things, WikiLeaks, that just came out.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  And she lied.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  Now she's blaming the lie on the late great Abraham Lincoln.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  That's one that I haven't.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Okay, honest Abe.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  Honest Abe never lied.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  That's the good thing.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  That's a big, big difference.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  We're talking about some difference.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Yeah, that was really a good example of Donald Trump really hitting his stride.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  And of course, that was a question where they asked him, I ask her, rather, about her statement saying,
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  well, you know, I've got a private policy position, then I have a public policy position.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  In other words, I've got two different ones and I lie to the public.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  I didn't really tell them what's really on my mind.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  And you know, first she tried to spend it in a number of ways.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  She said, well, I think that's strategic and it's presidential.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  And then of course, she did what she always does when she's in deep trouble.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  She pivots to the Ruskies.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  She goes on and starts talking about the Ruskies.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  But Donald Trump didn't let her off.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  He came back.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  Oh, she also threw in a thing about, well, I was just referring to something that Abraham Lincoln did.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  And Steven Spielberg wrote about.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  He came back and he said, okay, so you're saying that honest Abe lied to the public.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  I thought it was a great rhetorical flourish.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  Absolutely a good example of Donald Trump in command of this debate.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  From infowars.com.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  I'm David Knight.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  Yeah, they follow those special reports during the live debate.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Let's back that up because I want to point out something about mind control.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  That's our old studio.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  We've loaded images in there that are about three years old.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  We need to put new ones in, but we show the TSA searching people without warrants.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  We show Nazi Germany doing it.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  And I've had mainstream reporters the last couple of years, twice that we're here.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  I don't even have them here anymore.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  I wouldn't have time for it.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  They can make it whatever they want.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  Being interviewing me in there because I kind of office out of that radio room.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  That's kind of my office.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  That's the room I like to get real cold in there and it's nice and padded walls and you
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  can't hear anything and it's a good place to think.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  That's kind of my office.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  So I'll be interviewing there and they'll go, excuse me, what's the Nazi thing right
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  there?
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  And because there's a bunch of those showing, you know, the globalist and homeland security
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  like Nazis because they are.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  I mean, the 68 gun control act was taken from the Nuremberg trials.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  It was the, you know, Nazi gun control thing from the Weimar Republic that previously dated
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  the Nazis, but they codified it.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  And twice, I just remembered that they've said, what's that Nazi stuff?
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  Or would you want to explain this?
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  And I look at them and I go, I'm not going to explain that to you.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Make it up if I'm a Nazi, if you want.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Oh, really?
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  And I go, one's the TSA searching somebody.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  One is the Nazis.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  Do you understand, dumbass?
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  That's what I'm going to have.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  And they get it.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  They just want to score a point.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  They just want to be able to say I'm a Nazi.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  This is how they have no morals.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  That's one of my blind spots.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  I just have to get in their mindset where they don't care about real stuff.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  They just want to find some leverage.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  They're the high ground.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  They're the liberals.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  No, they're not.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  They're the fascist.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  And the Republican Party is just as bad and they're all against Trump.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  Duh.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  I mean, it was like I was up there after I had the Muslims confronting me up on this
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  hilltop shooting a video Saturday titled Donald Trump must attack or drop out.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  Thank God he got it and attacked.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  And then this guy walks over and goes, I don't watch your show.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  Let's get his wife.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  He's like, are you a Christian?
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  And there's this thing where these fake Christians always, are you a Christian?
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  And I'm like, well, I don't pray up on the mountain top.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  I just do broadcasts from it.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  I'm not like the Pharisees and then they're going, well, you're a Christian.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  You don't know in the Bible and the New Testament Christ is all about the people that tell you
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  what they are and how perfect they are all day and how much they love God and how they
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  don't commit sins and how they don't do anything and blah, blah, blah.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  How wonderful they are.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  And then Christ beats them with whips.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  He goes, oh, so are you?
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  I go, my God, you didn't even understand what I just said.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  You're a pseudo intellectual that wants to come over to me.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  And I mean, Zimmerman was there.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  I was, I was, you know, I was fit to be taught.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  I just yelled at the Muslims and I yelled at the six, seven Muslims.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  I just said, look, you're bugging your ass out of that tough, hopping around with your
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  shirts off.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  Your damn country so much, get back to it.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  Oh, you're not laughing now, are you?
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Because I'm done.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  I'm through.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  You people want to shoot your mouths off and start wars that you can't back up.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  Now you want World War III.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  I'm not going to stand here and take it.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  And neither are the American people.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  Excuse me.
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  Let me just plug now.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  I'm just going to get out of here.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  I'm just going to get the rest of the break.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  We need to get funding.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  We have the very best nutraceuticals anybody can get.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  I thought everybody wanted to put out the best stuff.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  Most people just want to put out a bunch of crap, do a bunch of marketing and have
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  naked chicks dancing around to sell it to you in bikinis or whatever.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  We got the best selenium.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  We got the best essential oils combined for lung cleanse.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  We've got the best DNA force.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  Bio PQQ, CoQ10 all over the other formula.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  We got 23% off on that.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  We got the new probiotic, which we believe is the very best out there.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:41.600]  has the whole industry freaking out,
[1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:43.560]  bomb defense available, infowarslive.com,
[1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:45.520]  infowarsstore.com, find the operation,
[1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:46.640]  you've got a guarantee for me,
[1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:49.680]  I will rampage against the enemy.
[1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:53.520]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:53.520 --> 1:29:56.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:56.540 --> 1:30:01.540]  The U.S. presidential election, the revolution underway
[1:30:05.600 --> 1:30:07.980]  in America mirrors the referendum that happened
[1:30:07.980 --> 1:30:09.520]  a few months ago in Great Britain,
[1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:11.160]  led by Nigel Farage.
[1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:13.160]  This referendum led by Donald Trump
[1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:15.400]  is a war waged against Wall Street,
[1:30:15.400 --> 1:30:18.320]  the globalist and the political elites in this country.
[1:30:18.320 --> 1:30:20.320]  Farage recently weighed in on Trump saying
[1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:22.800]  that his remarks that stirred up such a fuss this week
[1:30:22.800 --> 1:30:24.880]  were nothing more than alpha male boasting
[1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:27.000]  and pointed out that his American counterpart
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:28.600]  isn't running to be Pope.
[1:30:28.600 --> 1:30:30.680]  Americans need a leader, a fighter,
[1:30:30.680 --> 1:30:32.880]  one that stands up like Trump did last night
[1:30:32.880 --> 1:30:34.600]  and historically took off the gloves
[1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:36.040]  when attacking Clinton.
[1:30:36.040 --> 1:30:37.980]  The one line that will go down in history
[1:30:37.980 --> 1:30:40.320]  from last night's debate, Trump called out Clinton
[1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:43.040]  on her law breaking and said that if he were president,
[1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:44.240]  she'd be in jail.
[1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:46.320]  America's Brexit is in full force
[1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:48.680]  and it's up to the American people to exercise
[1:30:48.680 --> 1:30:51.160]  the same strength our British counterparts did
[1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:54.040]  and no longer act as puppets for the globalist agenda.
[1:30:54.040 --> 1:30:57.160]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for infowars.com.
[1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:01.880]  We're selling a product, DNA Force,
[1:31:01.880 --> 1:31:06.640]  that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:08.240]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you
[1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:09.840]  to develop DNA Force for us.
[1:31:09.840 --> 1:31:11.760]  It's been something that I've been working on
[1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:13.400]  for a long time, Alex, because I think
[1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:15.440]  it's very, very important.
[1:31:15.440 --> 1:31:18.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates,
[1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:21.560]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[1:31:21.560 --> 1:31:24.800]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:26.520]  But when it runs out, you start dying.
[1:31:26.520 --> 1:31:29.440]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175
[1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:30.760]  different clinical trials.
[1:31:30.760 --> 1:31:33.760]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[1:31:33.760 --> 1:31:35.400]  It works like an antioxidant.
[1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:38.840]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:41.440]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[1:31:41.440 --> 1:31:42.520]  It's in powder form.
[1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:45.280]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[1:31:45.280 --> 1:31:46.120]  I take this.
[1:31:46.120 --> 1:31:47.920]  This is the product that I take.
[1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:50.720]  infowarslife.com, and the profit we make.
[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:51.560]  We fight the globalists.
[1:31:51.560 --> 1:31:52.600]  We fight the New World Order.

[1:31:59.960 --> 1:32:02.000]  Brain Force, it's completely different.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:03.200]  Try a bottle of it.
[1:32:03.200 --> 1:32:07.920]  Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20-plus hours.
[1:32:07.920 --> 1:32:09.000]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:09.960]  I'd been working all day.
[1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:12.440]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[1:32:12.440 --> 1:32:14.440]  I get in here at 8.30.
[1:32:14.440 --> 1:32:15.760]  I was kind of run down.
[1:32:15.760 --> 1:32:17.680]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:20.000]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:21.440]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:22.400]  I popped two of them.
[1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:24.760]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing.
[1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:26.840]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:28.200]  Got four and a half stars.
[1:32:28.200 --> 1:32:29.480]  People really love it.
[1:32:29.480 --> 1:32:30.160]  Read about it.
[1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:32.800]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites
[1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:34.800]  give it such high praise, because it really
[1:32:34.800 --> 1:32:37.920]  does have the best organic-based systems that
[1:32:37.920 --> 1:32:39.200]  will blow your socks off.
[1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:41.000]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:43.560]  But I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:45.920]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[1:32:45.920 --> 1:32:47.200]  Took three hours of sleep.
[1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:49.680]  Got up, took two more Brain Force, and came in.
[1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:53.280]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products
[1:32:53.280 --> 1:33:10.880]  at infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:14.120]  It's Monday, October 10, 2016.
[1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:17.200]  Only 28 days left as the world watches
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:19.240]  the people of the United States attempt
[1:33:19.240 --> 1:33:22.480]  to break away from the new World War and global governance.
[1:33:22.480 --> 1:33:27.520]  This is self-determination, 1776, in the year 2016.
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:44.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:46.480]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:48.440]  And at the start of the next hour,
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:50.840]  I'm going to launch another contest
[1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:53.360]  to hang posters around the country.
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:55.440]  And whoever does the best job shooting video of it,
[1:33:55.440 --> 1:33:59.400]  putting it on YouTube, posting it in legal and lawful areas,
[1:33:59.400 --> 1:34:01.840]  physically posting it, then shooting video, posting it.
[1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:02.960]  So that goes viral.
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:05.960]  Handing them out, Sky Banners, whatever's legal and lawful,
[1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:08.680]  projecting Bill Clinton's a rapist on the side of a wall,
[1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:11.000]  Hillary's a traitor, Benghazi, whatever.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:12.440]  We'll get $5,000.
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:15.320]  But we're only running it until next Friday.
[1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:16.360]  We don't have a lot of time.
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:17.520]  So get your videos in.
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:19.240]  Everybody's going to be a winner.
[1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:21.320]  I wrote checks Friday, I'm writing more checks for folks
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:23.960]  that confront Bill Clinton on his sexual crimes pass,
[1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:25.880]  $1,000 for having the shirt on,
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:28.120]  for five seconds or more on TV, clearly visible,
[1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:29.720]  5,000 if you have the shirt on,
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:34.440]  or the image of Bill exposing his rape history,
[1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:36.480]  and then also get it audibly, repeatedly
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:38.280]  out on national television.
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:39.760]  But again, it just makes it fun
[1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:41.520]  to have the prize, to have the bounty.
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:43.960]  I'm doing that so Clinton knows where it's coming from.
[1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:45.360]  I'm doing that because metaphysically,
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:50.320]  I need to stand on the bridge against the borough.
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:52.640]  I have to physically put myself in the game
[1:34:52.640 --> 1:34:53.760]  to get the profits.
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:56.560]  And your whole life's a ritual, folks.
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:34:58.240]  Your whole life's a spiritual war.
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:00.320]  Your whole life, that's what this is.
[1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:01.880]  These are the secrets.
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:03.280]  You have to put skin in the game.
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:06.080]  You have to have the will like Donald Trump
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:08.400]  has to be the man in the arena.
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:10.200]  We can all question over and over again,
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:13.000]  but he's our champion fighting pure evil.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:16.080]  He's clearly for real.
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:16.920]  He's not perfect.
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:18.240]  He never said he was.
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:20.360]  If he just said he was perfect,
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:21.520]  then I had a problem.
[1:35:21.520 --> 1:35:23.040]  He said, you know who I am?
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:24.440]  He did that on live radio.
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:26.440]  He said, oh, we found this Howard Stern.
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:29.600]  Oh my gosh, oh, who'd you think you signed on to?
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:30.840]  He doesn't want war with the Russians.
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:31.840]  He wants you to be prosperous.
[1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:32.680]  He loves God.
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:35.160]  And he's proven it by his actions.
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:36.400]  King David had his best friend killed
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:37.720]  so he could have his wife.
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:39.160]  But he later repented.
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:40.000]  And God knew it was real.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:41.680]  He said, that's a man from my own heart right there.
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:44.960]  Did Donald Trump kill somebody's husband to get the woman?
[1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:47.320]  I don't think we got real questions here.
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:49.400]  We're dealing with, do we?
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:51.160]  Who have real discernment and can see
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:53.040]  you judge a tree by its fruits?
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:54.640]  The Clintons are a poison tree.
[1:35:56.600 --> 1:35:59.040]  So we're going to get the video slowed down
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:01.200]  frame by frame by frame.
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:03.480]  And the response of Hillary Clinton,
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:04.960]  I need it by the day, guys, or I can do it.
[1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:06.040]  I'll take a 10 minute break.
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:06.880]  I'll get the video.
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:09.440]  I can slow down and appear because I need it.
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:11.680]  And I need to put it out iconically
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:15.440]  with that video tells a million words.
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:17.280]  Bill Clinton has a history of sexual abuse.
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:18.120]  He needs to be exposed.
[1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:19.760]  We must use a psychotic image.
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:22.360]  We must hit the forewinds with it.
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:23.840]  We must hammer the enemy
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:25.520]  because they could stage a war.
[1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:27.120]  They could release a bio weapon.
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:28.200]  They could do anything.
[1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:29.200]  They could detonate a nuke,
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:30.840]  the missing nukes from West Texas.
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:32.040]  They could do anything.
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:34.120]  The sky's the limit with these creeps.
[1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:35.400]  That's why we need the Secret Service
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:38.360]  and the government people, everybody watching them.
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:40.600]  If you see them start to move with criminal activities,
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:41.720]  call 911.
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:43.560]  I'm serious.
[1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:45.080]  Just like when the nukes were getting taken off,
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:45.920]  you know, the Air Force base,
[1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:47.480]  we got contacted by the police.
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:49.800]  Yes, I've just said who the source is
[1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:51.600]  because they later figured out who it was.
[1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:52.600]  It's the base police.
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:57.120]  There's so much going on.
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:36:58.080]  I mean, who do the police call?
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:36:59.240]  They know they call us
[1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:01.680]  because they know we'll tell the truth.
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:04.200]  They know the government's got this whole NSA thing.
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:05.440]  They've got the threat fusion centers.
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:07.120]  They're dialed in.
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:09.280]  I don't like the fact I'm being spied on,
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:10.280]  but the people in the government know
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:11.520]  I'm working 18 hours a day.
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:12.360]  I'm real.
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:13.200]  I love America.
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:14.040]  I love freedom.
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:14.880]  I love God.
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:15.720]  I'm fighting.
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:16.560]  I'm real.
[1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:18.600]  And it's self-preservation people.
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:20.880]  We can't let pure evil take over.
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:22.120]  We've got two different graphics.
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:22.960]  I'm gonna show them right now,
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:24.600]  but we're gonna launch this next hour.
[1:37:24.600 --> 1:37:25.440]  One's posterized.
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:26.600]  One's just the image.
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:28.520]  Raping America since 1993.
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:29.520]  I mean, he's been doing it longer,
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:32.080]  but he's been raping America as El Presidente.
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:36.560]  I'm gonna put them on screen for TV viewers
[1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:37.400]  for the next hour.
[1:37:37.400 --> 1:37:39.160]  We're gonna put an article up with the new initiative.
[1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:40.160]  I don't want to call it a contest.
[1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:43.360]  It's an initiative for the people to practice taking action
[1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:46.640]  and to take the globalist on.
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:49.840]  That's what this comes down to.
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:54.840]  Infowars.com is the tip of the spear.
[1:37:54.840 --> 1:37:56.040]  We need your prayers and support
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:37:57.840]  because so much is happening, obviously,
[1:37:57.840 --> 1:37:58.680]  so much is unfolding.
[1:37:58.680 --> 1:37:59.760]  I wanna play a couple more clips
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:00.600]  and we're going to our guests.
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:01.440]  I'm gonna give the phone number out
[1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:02.360]  and start taking your calls.
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:03.480]  In fact, I'll do that now.
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:05.680]  On the debate, what you think Trump did,
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:07.120]  how you think they're gonna strike back?
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:08.800]  All things Trump, all things America,
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:09.880]  all things the Brexit,
[1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:12.120]  all things escaping the New World Order.
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:12.960]  That's the topic.
[1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:14.000]  It's a big, giant area.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:15.400]  That's what we're discussing.
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:19.120]  800-259-9231.
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  800-2599-231 is the number.
[1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:26.320]  800-2599-231.
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.680]  We had 23,000 calls last night that tried to get in.
[1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:31.760]  23,000, people aren't gonna believe that.
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:34.040]  We ought to show our digital record to show people that.
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:36.800]  I mean, look, even national shows beg for calls.
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:38.200]  CNN has to beg for calls.
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:40.880]  We get 23,000.
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:42.280]  That's probably 5,000 people calling over.
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:43.240]  Number again, the point is,
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:44.960]  it just shows how huge this broadcast is.
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:47.560]  We had close to a million on our own streams.
[1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:49.560]  Was it 300, 400,000 on the YouTube streams,
[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:50.680]  a bunch of other streams?
[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:51.520]  AM and FM stations.
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:52.360]  And I'm not bragging,
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:53.920]  but the point is mainstream media claims
[1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:55.000]  they're the end-all, be-all.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  They're the little man behind the curtain.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:01.960]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:06.600]  I'm gonna play a few more of these clips.
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:12.600]  Let's play this clip where CNN got caught coaching
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:20.160]  the so-called focus group that they were gonna bring in
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:21.880]  and then CNN got caught coaching.
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:24.400]  I mean, it was so clear with that first black lady,
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:27.160]  asked the question that, oh, the moral,
[1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:29.040]  how are you gonna act for our children?
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:30.960]  That it was setting it up for Cooper to be able to go,
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:32.320]  oh yeah, what about moral?
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:33.880]  Since he said that,
[1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:35.760]  because again, they were gonna have Hillary
[1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:36.720]  not shake his hand.
[1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:38.560]  And then once that happened,
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:39.880]  he was gonna say, why didn't you shake his hand?
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:42.400]  Like he's not attacking, you know, straight out.
[1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:44.320]  He's fair and balanced,
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:45.200]  but it blew up in their face
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:47.000]  because he didn't try to shake her hand.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:48.960]  So that's more inside baseball,
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:51.600]  but here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:56.320]  America's great, all right, so I wanna ask you,
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:39:58.600]  what was it about Hillary Clinton's argument
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:00.280]  that resonated with you
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:03.280]  following Donald Trump's defense of the video?
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:05.720]  She stated that America's already great.
[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:07.280]  And I tend to agree with that,
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:09.280]  though we are slow in progressing,
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:10.800]  number varies, we are progressing,
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:12.400]  we need to continue the momentum.
[1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:16.760]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:20.840]  I have another clip I want to get to
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:22.440]  but it's important that deals
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:24.200]  with a whole host of these issues.
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:27.160]  And that's the CNN panel.
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:28.880]  Hillary did not defend Bill.
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:31.800]  This is very important because what can she say?
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:33.400]  He has settled rape cases.
[1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:35.160]  He has settled assault cases.
[1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:36.680]  He is a sex addict.
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:37.760]  He is a drug addict.
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:39.160]  He is completely mentally ill.
[1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:40.400]  No one respects him now.
[1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:41.800]  Obama's like, get on the plane.
[1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:42.640]  What's your problem?
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:44.600]  Come on, you know, for five minutes.
[1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:47.080]  I mean, this guy is in his own world.
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:48.960]  He's looking at people like a psychopath,
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:52.160]  anger at everybody. So let's go ahead
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:54.360]  and get to this piece.
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:56.720]  CNN panel, Hillary did not defend Bill.
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:00.720]  He gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:03.680]  He gets to decide what he wants to talk about
[1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:05.600]  instead of answering people's questions,
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:09.720]  talking about laying out the plans that we have
[1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:14.720]  that we think can make a better life in a better country.
[1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:15.960]  That's his choice.
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:18.280]  When I hear something like that,
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:22.240]  I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama,
[1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:23.520]  advised us all.
[1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:26.640]  When they go low, you go high.
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:32.240]  She got some applause for that line,
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:35.720]  but I didn't hear a robust vote of confidence,
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:38.480]  a defense of her husband in that response
[1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:40.880]  because he really went after Bill Clinton.
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:42.680]  Hillary Clinton didn't mention Bill Clinton's behavior
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:43.520]  or actions at all.
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:44.680]  She didn't defend her husband at all.
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:46.680]  She just went after, more or less, Donald Trump.
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:47.880]  It's not just saying you're trying to go back
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:49.280]  and we're talking about you here.
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:50.280]  A couple of points.
[1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:53.440]  Now, I'm gonna spend a few minutes with this gentleman
[1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:55.280]  and then start going to your phone calls.
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:00.160]  We open the phones up, 800-25-99-231.
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:05.720]  Micah Phemia is one of the folks
[1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:08.000]  that's gotten on national TV,
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.120]  exposing Bill Clinton right.
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:11.240]  We're gonna talk to him here in just a moment.
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:13.040]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:14.680]  New music out and of course, great throwback
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:15.520]  for his day music.
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:16.480]  By the way, he doesn't age.
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:17.320]  No, he doesn't.
[1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:18.160]  He looks great.
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:19.720]  We're all gonna rickroll.
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:20.560]  Exactly.
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:23.200]  A lot to get to in this half hour.
[1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:24.760]  Now, again, is that as spectacular
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:26.360]  as the fellow screaming for two minutes,
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:27.760]  Bill Clinton's a rapist and being grabbed
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:28.600]  and holding on to the fence?
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:30.440]  No, or a guy climbing over, doesn't matter.
[1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:31.520]  It's just as important.
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:33.040]  He went out, he took the initiative,
[1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:35.360]  he took action, he got it out there, 1,000 bucks.
[1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:37.360]  But I'm guessing he didn't do it with 1,000 bucks.
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:38.840]  That just makes it more fun.
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:42.240]  So we've had this happen 14 times, I know of.
[1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:44.760]  And what we're doing is exposing
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:46.160]  that they've been raping America,
[1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:49.600]  physically, economically, militarily.
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:51.240]  They're the authors of almost everything we've dealt with.
[1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:54.000]  They are the special interest point persons
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.760]  controlling the multinational takeover of this country.
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:42:58.920]  So Micah has micafemia.com.
[1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:03.120]  Micah is M-I-C-A-H-F-E-M-I-A.com.
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:04.280]  So we're gonna learn who this guy is,
[1:43:04.280 --> 1:43:05.800]  one of these other great activists we've been having on.
[1:43:05.800 --> 1:43:07.120]  We'll get the lady on soon.
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:08.800]  So as we can, who also had the rape shirt
[1:43:08.800 --> 1:43:10.520]  and all those other great folks, this is so exciting.
[1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:13.480]  And you keep wondering when's the next one gonna pop up?
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:15.480]  Wanna thank Drudge for linking to all these two
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:17.280]  and helping give it more legs.
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:19.440]  We're all in this together trying to save the Republic.
[1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:21.480]  So Micah, thanks for coming on today.
[1:43:21.480 --> 1:43:22.920]  Hey, my pleasure.
[1:43:22.920 --> 1:43:24.280]  It's an honor, honestly.
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:28.360]  When I heard the call, when you made the call,
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:30.480]  I mean, it was just crystal clear.
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:32.440]  This was for me to do.
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:34.600]  I mean, it wasn't about the money exactly like you said.
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:37.480]  It was about being able to exercise free speech.
[1:43:37.480 --> 1:43:40.560]  And I live here in New York in a sea of liberals
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:42.880]  and trendies, and it's really hard to be a patriot sometimes,
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:45.120]  but I knew Rockefeller, Schenner.
[1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:48.000]  I mean, they feed live every day.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.720]  So I kind of went in incognito
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:53.320]  and I gave myself a whole back story
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:58.320]  and I walked up to the guys and asked how much tickets were
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:00.680]  and knowing that I could just walk in
[1:44:00.680 --> 1:44:03.800]  and have my sign already made up.
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:07.760]  And it was just a quick, simple one, two fold here.
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:10.080]  And they had no idea, you know,
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:12.320]  and I wedged my way right in there
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:14.000]  and I aligned myself with the truth.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  And watching last night, Trump with some of the women,
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:22.400]  I mean, that's why I did it.
[1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:26.560]  It's for them, it's for giving these people a voice
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:28.400]  that are just being shut down.
[1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:31.160]  I mean, that's not America, but it is, sadly.
[1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:33.520]  And they can't stop it all.
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:37.840]  So if I made some NBC executive his pants a little,
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:41.040]  then, you know, I'm happy with that.
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:42.400]  Well, Michael, we have to use the term.
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:43.880]  It's like when I talk about pirate radio,
[1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:45.560]  people that have micros call them, they go,
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:46.920]  hey, man, it's micro radio.
[1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:48.480]  It's not referring to commercial stations.
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:50.040]  Why are you calling it the establishment name?
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:52.720]  Because the public doesn't know what a micro FM is.
[1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:55.320]  I have to say, pirate radio is really micro FM
[1:44:55.320 --> 1:44:56.360]  and it's blah, blah, blah.
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:44:58.240]  So we have to say liberal,
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:00.240]  but you seem kind of like an artist type smart guy.
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:01.520]  A lot of, you know, equipment stuff
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:03.120]  in the background for radio listeners.
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:05.240]  I mean, I'm guessing you sound like an artist.
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:06.800]  You seem like a smart guy.
[1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:07.720]  I mean, I'm a liberal.
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:08.960]  I like oil paintings.
[1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:10.000]  I like red wine.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:11.600]  I like classical music.
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:13.320]  I like to go see a play.
[1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:15.280]  I can also, if I got to, beat the hell out of somebody
[1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:16.720]  in a parking lot if I had to defend myself,
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:18.560]  but also like, you know, riding horses
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:20.840]  and also like eating barbecue.
[1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:21.960]  But I like looking at the stars.
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:24.680]  I mean, you know, it's like this corner on the market
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:26.000]  by these fake people,
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:27.920]  because they support the Democrats, they're good.
[1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:29.640]  The whole Republican establishment hates Trump.
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:30.920]  I hate them too.
[1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:32.840]  I mean, I hate the Republicans.
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:34.200]  I'm a liberal.
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:36.600]  I'm pro-human and I'm sick of them
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:38.560]  being able to even have the mantle
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:39.720]  of someone that's liberal.
[1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:42.400]  Liberal is cutting my taxes in half.
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:43.240]  What Trump's gonna do.
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:45.920]  I'm gonna hire so many people, it's gonna be crazy.
[1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:47.040]  Yeah, well, absolutely.
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:49.520]  I mean, I'm completely liberal in my heart.
[1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:51.240]  And as an artist, you know,
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:54.600]  that's the true liberation that we want is freedom
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:56.960]  and freedom to go out and be able to speak.
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:00.280]  And, you know, it's with information
[1:46:00.280 --> 1:46:01.360]  that we're gonna win this thing.
[1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:05.040]  And I feel like right now, Trump after last night's
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:07.600]  just destroying of Hillary.
[1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:09.720]  Anyone that watched that has to know
[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:14.720]  that the national consciousness is figuring out
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:17.000]  what is actually going on.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:21.160]  And it makes me feel like we gotta go to the next phase.
[1:46:21.160 --> 1:46:22.720]  They're gonna definitely steal this
[1:46:22.720 --> 1:46:25.160]  and try to steal this because they know they can't win it
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:27.760]  because when you listen to someone's heart,
[1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:29.680]  you can tell if they're telling the truth or not.
[1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:31.120]  I mean, I was trained as an actor
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:35.760]  and I learned that it's all from within.
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:37.640]  It doesn't matter what the words are.
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:38.960]  The way to be an actor is actually
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:40.680]  tell the truth and become that person
[1:46:40.680 --> 1:46:42.080]  and not be an actor.
[1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:43.240]  Exactly.
[1:46:43.240 --> 1:46:46.680]  When you can tell when that child actor, you know,
[1:46:46.680 --> 1:46:47.720]  she did a pretty good job.
[1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:49.120]  She should get a Disney role or something.
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:52.880]  But when she said, I see with my own eyes,
[1:46:52.880 --> 1:46:55.120]  that line right there was just a pure lie
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:57.520]  because you didn't see, you didn't know you were a prop
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:47:00.120]  in that game and it's a good sign,
[1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:02.040]  I think because they are desperate.
[1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:05.480]  And the look on Bill Clinton's face says it all.
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:07.520]  I mean, that really is it.
[1:47:07.520 --> 1:47:08.360]  They're scared.
[1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:13.120]  And when that last guy said, it's undisputable,
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:14.360]  that you're a rapist, I mean,
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:16.840]  that freeze frame was just incredible.
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:19.280]  He knows that it's coming.
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:20.160]  I mean, it's beautiful.
[1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:21.640]  It really is beautiful.
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:23.840]  I'm telling you a slowed down five second image
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:26.560]  of his eyes slowly wheeling in slow motion
[1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:28.040]  and then cutting to those women
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:30.240]  is gonna be a devastating 10 second video.
[1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:32.680]  Yeah, that's it.
[1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:34.560]  And anyway, we can get the word out.
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:37.080]  I mean, when you live in a city
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:40.160]  with millions of people coming and going, you know,
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:42.600]  I'm definitely gonna put that reward money
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:44.200]  towards some bumper stickers
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:46.800]  and gotta get a little selenium for myself.
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:48.440]  But you know, it's going right back in
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:51.160]  and I feel like there's no time.
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:55.520]  If you really believe in what's going on right now,
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:58.240]  you can't be passive about it
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:47:59.720]  and you can't not be emotional about it.
[1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:02.280]  And some people are turned off by getting angry
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:04.080]  or getting too excited or getting too emotional.
[1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:07.680]  And I feel like if that's holding you back,
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:12.240]  then you might as well just go back to sleep, you know?
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:13.080]  Absolutely.
[1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:14.960]  Being alive is bouncing off the walls.
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:16.120]  This is what humans were always like.
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:17.920]  They taught us just to kind of watch TV
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:19.880]  and just fade into the distance
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:21.240]  and just become these minions.
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:24.080]  But with a weird lady, with a clown head,
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:26.200]  with a shark face like the Joker,
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:29.040]  I mean, she could literally be a Marvel comic character,
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:32.160]  a bad guy, and I just don't get her constituents.
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:35.080]  I mean, Trump is obviously the real deal,
[1:48:35.080 --> 1:48:37.960]  the real, you know, goofball in ways like we all are,
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:40.240]  but he's gone through all this hell.
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:41.720]  We put him there to do this
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:44.400]  and I'm gonna hold his feet to the fire.
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:45.520]  I don't like some of the things he does,
[1:48:45.520 --> 1:48:47.400]  but that's part of how he's real.
[1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:49.120]  The difference is with Hillary, it is an act.
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:50.720]  I thought people that know Trump well,
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:52.040]  there's not an act with Trump.
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:54.200]  This is the real deal.
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:55.400]  No, absolutely.
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:58.120]  And anyone that actually watched the debate can see that.
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:48:59.280]  If you're reading the papers
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:00.600]  and they're saying Hillary won,
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:02.560]  and I mean, I was watching CNN,
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:04.840]  or I had CNN's website up last night,
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:07.320]  and they had all these talking points that were anti-Trump
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:08.640]  that they were reporting on
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:11.200]  that weren't even discussed yet in the debate.
[1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:13.560]  Like, it was, like, they spilled out their attack.
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:15.760]  Oh, by the way, they got caught again,
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:19.840]  double sampling, or right at double, it wasn't quite double.
[1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:22.280]  More Democrats than Republicans in the poll
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:23.160]  and then Hillary wins.
[1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:26.120]  I mean, what's crazy is they think we're so dumb,
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:27.520]  they admit it's rigged.
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:31.320]  I mean, it'd be like, again, it's a horse race.
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:33.720]  It's a mile horse race, there's seven horses.
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:36.760]  Her horse is allowed to be a half mile ahead
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:38.800]  when they open the gates, and then they admit,
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:40.800]  in our race, we allowed this, you know,
[1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:43.560]  Sally Sue or whatever the name of the nag is,
[1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:46.080]  we allowed her to be halfway ahead when the gates open,
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:49.480]  or ND 500, we let this race car driver
[1:49:49.480 --> 1:49:52.560]  be 250 miles ahead, or let's be tentatively,
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:55.400]  it wasn't quite double, 200 miles ahead in the ND 500,
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:57.880]  and then he won by 100 miles.
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:00.520]  Well, you gave them 200 miles, it means he lost by 100.
[1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:03.400]  I mean, it's the insult that they double sample,
[1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:04.720]  or almost double sample.
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:07.040]  I mean, how the hell do they do that?
[1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:09.680]  Well, it's right in our face,
[1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:11.760]  and that's why they love it,
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:14.400]  is because they think they're getting away with it,
[1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:17.560]  but, you know, if you put it on a scale,
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:19.560]  I mean, this is the stuff they're throwing at Trump,
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:22.120]  right now, this, in the last 30 days,
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:24.160]  this is the worst that they can come up with,
[1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:25.320]  I mean, that's a great saying,
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:26.960]  I don't, you know, there's a lot of things,
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:30.280]  he is a man, and I feel like, you know,
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:34.080]  if you put, you know, a scale of what she's done,
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:37.760]  the murder, the actual rape, it's-
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:40.120]  The jihadis, she's worse than a James Bond villain,
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:42.120]  I mean, she's like an epic real villain,
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:44.680]  with a league of doom, a legion of doom,
[1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:46.280]  with George Soros and the Saudis,
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:48.560]  and the Chinese communists, and the creepy pope,
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:51.640]  and it's just, it's like, what in the world?
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:54.280]  All against Trump, how could you not be for him?
[1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:55.720]  We'll be back with more,
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:50:56.560]  and then we're going to your phone call,
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:50:58.800]  stay there gentlemen, amazing patriot.
[1:51:00.440 --> 1:51:01.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson
[1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:03.640]  of the Genesis Communications Network.
[1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:06.360]  Over the 30 plus years I've been in finance,
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:07.920]  I can see that the world economy
[1:51:07.920 --> 1:51:09.720]  is now at a critical point.
[1:51:09.720 --> 1:51:12.040]  Unlimited money creation and runaway debt
[1:51:12.040 --> 1:51:14.760]  could trigger a collapse of the financial system.
[1:51:14.760 --> 1:51:16.640]  It's imperative that you protect yourself
[1:51:16.640 --> 1:51:19.680]  in case of hyperinflation or even deflation.
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:21.480]  Investment rarities has put together
[1:51:21.480 --> 1:51:24.400]  a survival bag of 200 silver quarters.
[1:51:24.400 --> 1:51:28.760]  These 90% silver quarters are dated 1964 and earlier.
[1:51:28.760 --> 1:51:31.080]  Each quarter is worth almost $5.
[1:51:31.080 --> 1:51:33.360]  If a quarter has already reached $5,
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:35.240]  the trend is obviously on your side.
[1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:38.040]  These survival bags sell for 8.95 delivered.
[1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:41.920]  Call 800-328-1860 to order today.
[1:51:41.920 --> 1:51:44.240]  Not only can these quarters be used for barter
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:46.440]  in a brief period of hyperinflation,
[1:51:46.440 --> 1:51:49.880]  they have the potential to appreciate five to 10 times.
[1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:52.480]  Call 800-328-1860.
[1:51:52.480 --> 1:51:54.520]  Get one for each member of your family.

[1:52:02.840 --> 1:52:04.200]  but growing scientific evidence

[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.240]  associated with exposure to EMF radiation
[1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:09.480]  emitted from these devices.

[1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:57.120]  American man, food storage, I love to eat.
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:52:57.960]  Yum!
[1:52:59.720 --> 1:53:02.360]  Today, I became a biophoton woman.
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:05.160]  I put a tablespoon of the Andreas five-seat oil
[1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:07.320]  in my morning one-world-way drink,
[1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:10.000]  and was still happy and energized at 3 p.m.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.760]  Normally, I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day,
[1:53:12.760 --> 1:53:15.440]  but today, I felt energy and very clear.
[1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:17.800]  My friend at the farmer's market asked what I was on.
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:19.360]  She said, my eyes look bright,
[1:53:19.360 --> 1:53:22.240]  and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon.
[1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:24.120]  I told her there was a magical oil
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:26.600]  that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy
[1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:27.800]  as if I were a plant.
[1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:29.480]  She said, I want some.
[1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:32.000]  A second one-world-way shake with the oil
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:33.800]  when I got home took me to bedtime
[1:53:33.800 --> 1:53:36.280]  with that wonderful, abundant energy.
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:38.280]  I couldn't believe how much I got done
[1:53:38.280 --> 1:53:39.600]  and how great I felt.
[1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:41.320]  The combination of one-world-way
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:44.200]  and five-seat oil produced a significant health event
[1:53:44.200 --> 1:53:46.720]  in my life, the time that makes you feel you've been
[1:53:46.720 --> 1:53:50.160]  given your life back with a bonus, and I'm 64.
[1:53:50.160 --> 1:53:53.560]  Five-seat oil in one-world-way for your fantastic health.
[1:53:53.560 --> 1:53:58.560]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit sacredseedoils.com.
[1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:05.920]  Our forces are hitting the enemy hard.
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:08.320]  The 10 guys' secret weapons.
[1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:11.400]  We've got 28 days, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:15.200]  We know the horse we put in the fight.
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:17.160]  We know he's a man, he's not perfect.
[1:54:17.160 --> 1:54:19.520]  He never hit any of it.
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:20.960]  We found Howard Stern interviews.
[1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:22.720]  You found the secret interviews.
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:24.480]  My enemies do that too.
[1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:27.600]  They go, we found a tape where Alex Jones admits
[1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:30.960]  he's had family, and it's the CIA.
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:33.160]  We've got him now, and it's like my show,
[1:54:33.160 --> 1:54:35.640]  me saying it on air, and how horrible it is,
[1:54:35.640 --> 1:54:39.880]  and how horrible they told me it was.
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:44.760]  I mean, it's like there's all these mentally deficient
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:47.880]  people, I'm not being mean, who make up whatever they want,
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:50.240]  and then they call me a conspiracy theorist.
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:51.640]  We put airplanes in the sky saying,
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:52.640]  Hillary's for prison.
[1:54:52.640 --> 1:54:54.880]  We put driving billboards all over the place.
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:56.600]  We had the Secret Service high-fying us,
[1:54:56.600 --> 1:54:58.400]  and I was like, don't do that, you're gonna get in trouble.
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:54:59.600]  They're like, oh, we don't care.
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:00.920]  She's a Chinese agent.
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:04.000]  They've never acted like that.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:07.600]  They told us she's having convulsions and falling down.
[1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:08.920]  We were finding a video.
[1:55:08.920 --> 1:55:12.000]  They took it off CNN where she starts to do it last night.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:13.960]  And then she falls down weeks after I tell you,
[1:55:13.960 --> 1:55:15.200]  because it's real.
[1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:21.000]  We really do know Hillary's attack plan on Trump.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:22.800]  We really knew that she was planning to not shake
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:23.640]  his hand last night.
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:24.800]  Notice it didn't happen.
[1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:26.960]  She didn't extend it, because Trump didn't extend it.
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:27.800]  He knew.
[1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:30.880]  I mean, we're in the fight.
[1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:32.920]  Hillary's attacking us.
[1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:33.760]  You are in the fight.
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:34.600]  You're the listeners.
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:35.440]  You're the power.
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:36.920]  You're everything.
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:39.840]  This gentleman, Micah Femia, they're in New York,
[1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:43.920]  going out, putting the sign up, getting it on the news
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:45.520]  on one of the biggest, highest-rated shows.
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:47.200]  They still have big ratings on those morning shows.
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:49.280]  Five, six, seven million viewers.
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:52.000]  All of that is having a giant effect.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:53.720]  All of it is freaking them out.
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:56.320]  And you notice, Trump said, hey, lock you up.
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:55:59.400]  Hillary for President asked General Flynn,
[1:55:59.400 --> 1:56:00.400]  should she be put in prison?
[1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:01.760]  Yeah, Hillary for President, she's a criminal.
[1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:03.400]  She's involved with Al Qaeda.
[1:56:03.400 --> 1:56:05.960]  Folks, she expanded Al Qaeda.
[1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:07.360]  It was 20-something countries a month ago.
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:08.200]  It's 30-plus.
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:10.000]  There's a global jihad right now.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:11.280]  I'm not against the average Muslim.
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:12.440]  They're people that are just trying to live in peace.
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:15.560]  But the big, mean, gangster Islamists
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:18.560]  by Saudi Arabia's funding are taking over.
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:19.960]  So I was against the wars in the Middle East.
[1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:22.200]  I was against going and doing those bad things, those people.
[1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:24.880]  And the secular countries like Iraq, to put radicals in.
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:27.760]  Now that radicals are in, we have to oppose that.
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:29.840]  They're gonna bring them in and let them attack us
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:30.880]  and then take our freedoms.
[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:32.160]  No, you're not.
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:33.520]  I'm not submitting.
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:34.760]  I'm not a Muslim.
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:37.200]  I'm a Christian.
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:40.320]  I'm an American.
[1:56:41.440 --> 1:56:42.440]  I'm a patriot.
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:46.120]  And I will never submit to you.
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:46.960]  Going back to our guests,
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:47.800]  we're gonna start the next hour.
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:48.640]  We're gonna write the calls.
[1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:53.640]  Micahfema.com, other great points you wanna add, my friend.
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:57.040]  Yeah, it's Femiya too, by the way.
[1:56:57.040 --> 1:56:58.680]  I never actually correct you originally.
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:56:59.520]  I apologize.
[1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:00.640]  I always pronounce everything right.
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:01.720]  How do you say it?
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:02.840]  It's Femiya.
[1:57:02.840 --> 1:57:04.840]  Femiya, like family.
[1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:06.960]  Exactly, exactly like family.
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:09.120]  All right, I know a little bit of Latin,
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:10.200]  but then I always say it wrong.
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:12.200]  So it doesn't mean family in Italian?
[1:57:12.200 --> 1:57:13.760]  It does.
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:14.840]  It actually...
[1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:17.520]  So see, I can't say it right, but I know what it means.
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:18.360]  Exactly.
[1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:19.200]  That's how my brain works.
[1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:20.040]  I'm a weirdo.
[1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:20.880]  Go ahead, sorry.
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:21.840]  Femiya, Femiya, Femiya.
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:24.800]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, you go ahead.
[1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:28.080]  No, I actually lived above a couple of people
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:30.400]  that were refugees from Yemen.
[1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:32.680]  And it was spectacular.
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:35.720]  One time, we thought we saw something in their apartment
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:38.880]  and it took about five hours for the cops
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:42.320]  to finally go and check things out.
[1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:45.240]  They interviewed me for five hours instead of them.
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:47.880]  And it was like two minutes.
[1:57:47.880 --> 1:57:50.680]  And I'm thinking this is how we're set up right now.
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:53.400]  I mean, what if something really was going on?
[1:57:53.400 --> 1:57:55.840]  And I had seen some very sketchy behavior going on
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:57:58.080]  and I ended up moving out of that apartment,
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:00.360]  but it's real to me here.
[1:58:00.360 --> 1:58:04.160]  And I feel like everyone needs a cold shower.
[1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:06.240]  We got to wake up the whole body here.
[1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:07.080]  And that's what...
[1:58:07.080 --> 1:58:07.920]  You know what, I talked to her.
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:08.760]  I want to give you five more minutes
[1:58:08.760 --> 1:58:09.600]  because you're a really interesting guy.
[1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:11.120]  Then I promised one to all the callers,
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:12.800]  but we have Micah Femiya.
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:13.920]  Get it right that time?
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:14.760]  Got it.
[1:58:14.760 --> 1:58:15.600]  Okay, good.
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:18.360]  Micahfemiya.com, F-E-M-I-A.com.
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:19.200]  We're going to break right down.
[1:58:19.200 --> 1:58:20.200]  Please don't forget, I barely plugged.
[1:58:20.200 --> 1:58:21.120]  You mentioned the selenium.
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:22.480]  We have the bio, true selenium.
[1:58:22.480 --> 1:58:23.600]  The very best for mustard seed.
[1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:26.720]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:28.120]  We have 23% off DNA force.
[1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:29.120]  It's about to end in a few days.
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:30.360]  That's our flagship product,
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:31.840]  the Biome Defense Probiotic.
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:32.800]  The Hiller for Prison shirt
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:34.680]  is about to end 28 days to get that.
[1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:36.760]  And the new Don't Tread on Me Hillery shirt,
[1:58:36.760 --> 1:58:38.480]  lock her up, limited edition,
[1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:40.400]  Made in America, InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:42.400]  Back in 70 to finish up with him.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:44.920]  Then more clips, but first year calls.
[1:58:44.920 --> 1:58:47.200]  Stay with us, two hours left in transmission.
[1:58:47.200 --> 1:58:52.040]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here,
[1:58:52.040 --> 1:58:53.240]  host of The Bright Side.
[1:58:53.240 --> 1:58:54.120]  And as many of you know,
[1:58:54.120 --> 1:58:56.000]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:57.080]  and stay healthy.
[1:58:57.080 --> 1:58:59.120]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:00.600]  Despite spending trillions of dollars
[1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:03.360]  in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man,
[1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:04.840]  woman and child in this country.
[1:59:04.840 --> 1:59:07.080]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease
[1:59:07.080 --> 1:59:09.280]  and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:10.640]  One out of three or four people
[1:59:10.640 --> 1:59:12.200]  is dealing with some kind of health challenge
[1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:14.120]  and everyone knows at least one person
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:15.840]  with a degenerative disease.
[1:59:15.840 --> 1:59:17.400]  If you're dealing with a health challenge

[1:59:18.680 --> 1:59:19.920]  your vigor and longevity,

[2:00:01.320 --> 2:00:03.320]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[2:00:03.320 --> 2:00:06.320]  Micah Emile, Texas.
[2:00:06.320 --> 2:00:08.320]  In.
[2:00:08.320 --> 2:00:10.320]  Always obsessed on names of them wrong.
[2:00:10.320 --> 2:00:11.320]  Amin.

[2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:21.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:26.320]  All right, Micah.
[2:00:26.320 --> 2:00:27.320]  Amin is our guest.
[2:00:27.320 --> 2:00:29.320]  Micahfema.com.
[2:00:29.320 --> 2:00:30.320]  Emile.
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:31.320]  And we're going to go to your phone calls
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:33.320]  right after this short segment.
[2:00:33.320 --> 2:00:35.320]  Bunch of other clips, a ton of other news.
[2:00:35.320 --> 2:00:37.320]  I forgot to even get into what he mentioned.
[2:00:37.320 --> 2:00:39.320]  CNN rigged the latest poll again.
[2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:42.320]  But what does your gut tell you
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:44.320]  about dirty tricks the next 28 days,
[2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:45.320]  where we're going?
[2:00:45.320 --> 2:00:47.320]  Obviously, we're going to throw everything they can
[2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:49.320]  against us if Trump gets in too.
[2:00:49.320 --> 2:00:52.320]  But we can't just submit and put Hillary in.
[2:00:52.320 --> 2:00:55.320]  She's clearly trying to start something with Russia.
[2:00:55.320 --> 2:00:56.320]  It's ugly.
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:01.320]  It's something that we have to just keep cracking at those eggs.
[2:01:01.320 --> 2:01:03.320]  I mean, I feel like they're trying to boil everyone up
[2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:05.320]  and we got to keep cracking at them, you know,
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:08.320]  small cracks, big cracks before they get hard boiled.
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:10.320]  Otherwise, it's too late.
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:14.320]  And, you know, I know my sign wasn't the most heroic.
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:15.320]  I got in and out peacefully.
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:16.320]  And it was funny.
[2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:17.320]  I even went back.
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:20.320]  If you watch the footage, there's some blurry signs
[2:01:20.320 --> 2:01:22.320]  because it wasn't close up behind Savannah.
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:23.320]  What's her name?
[2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:26.320]  But, you know, these people are blind to it.
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:27.320]  I was holding up a sign and said,
[2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:28.320]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:32.320]  And they didn't even care.
[2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:35.320]  I mean, it was like clockwork walking out of there.
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:37.320]  And I feel like this is biblical.
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:41.320]  I mean, this is, the Trump ends their sounding.
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:43.320]  Honestly, whoever said that last night, I mean,
[2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:44.320]  I thought of that too.
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:48.320]  It's, you know, the flies are trying to get in to Hillary.
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:49.320]  She's pure evil.
[2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:54.320]  And if we don't, if you're not actively trying to wake up,
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:56.320]  at least the people that you love and your family,
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:01:57.320]  and that's where it starts,
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:01:59.320]  you have to have these conversations, the hard ones,
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:04.320]  even though, you know, you think that they're so close minded,
[2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:08.320]  you have to keep chipping away and cracking away at it.
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:10.320]  Otherwise, you're just giving up yourself.
[2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:13.320]  And, and I don't know, I just can't stand by and do that.
[2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:14.320]  And that's why I love it.
[2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:15.320]  I agree with you.
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:16.320]  And that's why I've gotten so emotional.
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:18.320]  I mean, I'm very cold about my analysis,
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:20.320]  but I, the history, what's happening,
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:22.320]  realizing what's coming, if she wins,
[2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:25.320]  this is all a manifestation of global resistance to tyranny,
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:26.320]  the Briggs at Russia.
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:27.320]  And what's happening here?
[2:02:27.320 --> 2:02:28.320]  Right.
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:29.320]  Right.
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:32.320]  And I feel bad for, you know, Hillary's granddaughter.
[2:02:32.320 --> 2:02:33.320]  I mean, she's an actual person.
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:37.320]  And, and, and this is just, it's pure evil.
[2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:40.320]  And it's like, God's working through you.
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:42.320]  And that's why I've always wanted to thank you.
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:43.320]  And I know you don't like to be thanked,
[2:02:43.320 --> 2:02:45.320]  but I want to thank God right now for working through you
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:47.320]  and through your team as a vessel.
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:49.320]  And if I could be anything, you know,
[2:02:49.320 --> 2:02:52.320]  a little cog in the wheel, like I'm going to keep going.
[2:02:52.320 --> 2:02:55.320]  And, and I know that anyone out there,
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:56.320]  they just have to make the decision.
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:02:58.320]  I mean, people told me not to do it.
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:02.320]  People told me they doubted if it was even going to be a real thing.
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:03.320]  And I'm like, are you kidding me?
[2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:05.320]  Alex Jones is a man of his word.
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:07.320]  And you obviously don't know him like that.
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:09.320]  And this is going down.
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:10.320]  I can do it.
[2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:11.320]  And it's all about mentality.
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:12.320]  And if we have to just,
[2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:15.320]  we have to stay in that positive mentality that this is it.
[2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:17.320]  This is the only chance that we get.
[2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:20.320]  Donald Trump is our only way out of this mess.
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:23.320]  And if it goes to Hillary, it's done.
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:25.320]  And that really is how drastic we have to think.
[2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:27.320]  And everyone needs to get out there.
[2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:31.320]  We need to organize and we need to figure out how to do things
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:32.320]  with members.
[2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:34.320]  I mean, I didn't have anyone else to go with that.
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:35.320]  Yeah.
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:37.320]  I could have had a bullhorn if someone would have, you know,
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:39.320]  passed it over the fence easily, but sure.
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:41.320]  Well, we've had a hundred thousand dollar contest before
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:43.320]  and people couldn't believe it when the check actually came.
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:45.320]  They got on air and they went on their own sky.
[2:03:45.320 --> 2:03:47.320]  They go, look, it came last week.
[2:03:47.320 --> 2:03:48.320]  We were doing mock checks.
[2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:50.320]  They don't want me to actually sign real checks with, you know,
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:51.320]  the numbers on them on air.
[2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:54.320]  And I was like, well, some of these guys are getting $5,000 checks.
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:55.320]  This isn't rights in the back.
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:57.320]  So I've actually got to get to that when I say checks in the mail.
[2:03:57.320 --> 2:03:58.320]  I've got to get to it.
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:03:59.320]  But it isn't about that.
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:02.320]  It's about taking action and about the little people are really
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:05.320]  the big people and doing it and create the excitement,
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:07.320]  the electricity that money's involved.
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:10.320]  I've had a lot of contests where it's not even money's involved.
[2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:12.320]  Those are some of the biggest we have, but I'm going to have a
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:15.320]  $5,000 contest on putting up, you know, different signs about
[2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:19.320]  Bill Clinton and about Hillary and Benghazi because it's about
[2:04:19.320 --> 2:04:23.320]  people getting the idea that even if they shut down the media,
[2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:27.320]  we can go out and we can do things in public that have an even
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:28.320]  bigger effect.
[2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:29.320]  All right.
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:31.320]  Well, Micah, Famiya, thank you so much.
[2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:34.320]  Micahfamiya.com will obviously talk to you again soon.
[2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:35.320]  And hey, do it again.
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:36.320]  Oh, I should have added.
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:38.320]  You can win repeatedly.
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:41.320]  Go get it or just keep doing it over and over again.
[2:04:41.320 --> 2:04:42.320]  Great job.
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:43.320]  Plenty more shows.
[2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:44.320]  Great job, my friend.
[2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:46.320]  And look, at the time I'm stumbling through this because
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:47.320]  I'm tired at the time.
[2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:48.320]  I'm just doing my best job I can.
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:50.320]  I appreciate the listeners and the viewers.
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:52.320]  Your phone calls are three minutes away.
[2:04:52.320 --> 2:04:53.320]  I'm going directly to you.
[2:04:53.320 --> 2:04:54.320]  More clips and a lot more.
[2:04:54.320 --> 2:05:00.320]  Stay with us.
[2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:03.320]  George Soros isn't happy with Russian President Vladimir Putin
[2:05:03.320 --> 2:05:06.320]  for his, quote, heinous crimes against humanity in Syria.
[2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:10.320]  Soros said the world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe
[2:05:10.320 --> 2:05:13.320]  of historic proportions and it's being perpetuated by the
[2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:14.320]  president of Russia.
[2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:15.320]  Oh, really?
[2:05:15.320 --> 2:05:18.320]  Well, the war awards continue to Soros to ledge that Russian
[2:05:18.320 --> 2:05:21.320]  aircraft is targeting civilians in Aleppo to assist Syrian
[2:05:21.320 --> 2:05:22.320]  forces on the ground.
[2:05:22.320 --> 2:05:26.320]  Aleppo, as we know, is a known ISIS stronghold and the Russians
[2:05:26.320 --> 2:05:29.320]  at the invitation of the sovereign government of Syria have
[2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:31.320]  launched a bombing campaign against ISIS.
[2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:34.320]  The Russians successfully retook the ancient city of
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:37.320]  Palmyra from the Islamic State, something we failed to do.
[2:05:37.320 --> 2:05:40.320]  Symbolically, of course, the recapture of Palmyra means that
[2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:43.320]  there are defenders of civilization over barbarism.
[2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:44.320]  We just have words.
[2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:47.320]  Where was Soros in the 1990s when Madeleine Albright
[2:05:47.320 --> 2:05:51.320]  stressed the human collateral damage of 500,000 Iraqi children
[2:05:51.320 --> 2:05:53.320]  was, quote, worth it to us?
[2:05:53.320 --> 2:05:56.320]  We must question why he suddenly cares so much now.
[2:05:56.320 --> 2:06:21.320]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:06:26.320 --> 2:06:51.320]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:06:51.320 --> 2:07:03.320]  Infowars is proud to announce the official Infowars Live app
[2:07:03.320 --> 2:07:05.320]  available now for iPhone and Android.

[2:07:28.320 --> 2:07:31.320]  This is the first release, and it was completely built
[2:07:31.320 --> 2:07:32.320]  from the ground up.
[2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:34.320]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks
[2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:36.320]  attempting to deceive you.
[2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:38.320]  In short, the major media is being covertly manipulated
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:40.320]  by well-financed political forces who are trying
[2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:42.320]  to sway public opinion in a natural direction
[2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:44.320]  that only serves establishment agendas.
[2:07:44.320 --> 2:07:47.320]  But Infowars Live is the solution to the controlled press
[2:07:47.320 --> 2:07:49.320]  that is rapidly losing influence.
[2:07:49.320 --> 2:07:53.320]  So download Infowars Live today at Infowars.com
[2:07:53.320 --> 2:07:55.320]  and learn what's really going on instead of being
[2:07:55.320 --> 2:08:18.320]  spoon-fed lies by the mainstream media.
[2:08:25.320 --> 2:08:36.320]  All right, I'm going right to your phone calls
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:38.320]  after I play this clip.
[2:08:38.320 --> 2:08:40.320]  I'm going to play this clip several more times
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:42.320]  for the show's over because it's so important.
[2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:43.320]  I've already played it once.
[2:08:43.320 --> 2:08:48.320]  This is when they bring up 11-year-old edited tape
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:51.320]  talking about some really gorgeous woman, you know,
[2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:52.320]  and the fact that, oh, but she was married
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:53.320]  so he couldn't date her.
[2:08:53.320 --> 2:08:55.320]  Clearly saying that.
[2:08:55.320 --> 2:08:56.320]  But it doesn't matter.
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:08:58.320]  He never claimed to be an angel.
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:08:59.320]  We found Howard Stern.
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:02.320]  It's a secret guy named Howard Stern.
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:05.320]  He has a secret show and we caught this secret thing,
[2:09:05.320 --> 2:09:07.320]  you know, him being asked dirty questions
[2:09:07.320 --> 2:09:10.320]  and responding to it.
[2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:11.320]  That's what you do.
[2:09:11.320 --> 2:09:12.320]  You go on the first show, you plug what you're doing,
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:13.320]  you talk about your issues,
[2:09:13.320 --> 2:09:15.320]  and then he asks you dirty questions.
[2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:16.320]  You go, okay, yes, I guess.
[2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:17.320]  Oh, yeah, all right, okay, whatever.
[2:09:17.320 --> 2:09:19.320]  That's what he does.
[2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:21.320]  Okay, all right, back to my hotel.
[2:09:21.320 --> 2:09:23.320]  Or back to my golf course.
[2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:25.320]  Or back to where I am on politics.
[2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:26.320]  The point is he went out of his way
[2:09:26.320 --> 2:09:30.320]  when it was popular to attack Iraq in 2003
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:32.320]  to go on Fox and CNN.
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:33.320]  We have the clips we played.
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:34.320]  I'm not gonna play them again.
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:36.320]  You see the media go again last night.
[2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:38.320]  You never said you were against the Iraq war.
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:40.320]  I forgot that part.
[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:41.320]  Yes, he did.
[2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:45.320]  And it's wrong to lie about it.
[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:48.320]  But again, they got Howard Stern 2006,
[2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:50.320]  three years after it starts.
[2:09:50.320 --> 2:09:51.320]  He didn't want to talk about it.
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:55.320]  So he's just like, yeah, okay, yeah, whatever.
[2:09:55.320 --> 2:09:57.320]  I mean, people walk to me in restaurants all the time.
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:09:58.320]  And I'm tired.
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:09:59.320]  It's like nine o'clock at night.
[2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:00.320]  And I'm just eating.
[2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:01.320]  And they're asking political questions.
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:03.320]  I'm like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:06.320]  Oh my gosh, Alex said, oh, yeah, whatever.
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:07.320]  This is the games they play.
[2:10:07.320 --> 2:10:09.320]  We know where Trump stands.
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:10.320]  We know what he's for.
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:13.320]  But this is what got Bill Clinton so unhappy
[2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:15.320]  and got him to flip out.
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:19.320]  Here is the video of Trump finally fighting back,
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:21.320]  five minutes into the debate,
[2:10:21.320 --> 2:10:22.320]  and then already hit him three times
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:25.320]  with how much he hated women for his statement.
[2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:28.320]  Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook,
[2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:31.320]  Trump says the campaign has changed him.
[2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:33.320]  When did that happen?
[2:10:33.320 --> 2:10:35.320]  So Mr. Trump, let me add to that.
[2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:38.320]  When you walked off that bus at age 59,
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:40.320]  were you a different man
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:44.320]  or did that behavior continue until just recently?
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:46.320]  And you have two minutes for this.
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:49.320]  I told you that was locker room talk.
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:51.320]  I'm not proud of it.
[2:10:51.320 --> 2:10:54.320]  I am a person who has great respect for people,
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:57.320]  for my family, for the people of this country.
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:10:58.320]  Good pause.
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:10:59.320]  And certainly I'm not proud of it.
[2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:00.320]  Back in about five seconds.
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:01.320]  Hillary's like, good.
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:02.320]  He's not fighting back.
[2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:03.320]  She's all secure.
[2:11:03.320 --> 2:11:04.320]  Good.
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:06.320]  He's going to let me just attack him.
[2:11:06.320 --> 2:11:07.320]  Good.
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:08.320]  We've got control of him.
[2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:09.320]  I can't believe he doesn't understand how weak I am.
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:10.320]  Good.
[2:11:10.320 --> 2:11:11.320]  He's under my control.
[2:11:11.320 --> 2:11:12.320]  Good.
[2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:13.320]  Yeah.
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:15.320]  But then he just hits her.
[2:11:15.320 --> 2:11:16.320]  And she doesn't like it.
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:18.320]  We were getting the clip, CNN pulled it.
[2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:20.320]  She starts going from another camera angle I saw.
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:21.320]  I saw it on Facebook.
[2:11:21.320 --> 2:11:22.320]  So did do.
[2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:23.320]  And when they're out there trying to find it,
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:26.320]  she starts going, ooh, like she's having another seizure.
[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:30.320]  But Clinton, Bill, the serial rapist,
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:32.320]  he really freaks here at us.
[2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:35.320]  I am a person who has great respect for people,
[2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:38.320]  for my family, for the people of this country.
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:40.320]  And certainly I'm not proud of it.
[2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:43.320]  But that was something that happened.
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:48.320]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words,
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:51.320]  and his was action, his was what he's done to women.
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:54.320]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:57.320]  in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:00.320]  So you can say any way you want to say it.
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:03.320]  But Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[2:12:03.320 --> 2:12:06.320]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:10.320]  and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:15.320]  One of the women who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old
[2:12:15.320 --> 2:12:18.320]  was raped at 12.
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:21.320]  Her client, she represented, got him off,
[2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:24.320]  and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions,
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:26.320]  laughing at the girl who was raped.
[2:12:26.320 --> 2:12:30.320]  Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight.
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:33.320]  So don't tell me about words.
[2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:37.320]  I am absolutely, I apologize for those words.
[2:12:37.320 --> 2:12:41.320]  But it is things that people say.
[2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:44.320]  But what President Clinton did, he was impeached.
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:47.320]  He lost his license to practice law.
[2:12:47.320 --> 2:12:52.320]  He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women,
[2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:55.320]  Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
[2:12:55.320 --> 2:13:00.320]  And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that,
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:04.320]  and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago,
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:07.320]  I think it's disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:09.320]  if you want to know the truth.
[2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:10.320]  Absolutely.
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:12.320]  He goes on to say she should be put in jail.
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:13.320]  She's clearly a criminal.
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:15.320]  And Bill Clinton could not stand it.
[2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:18.320]  We're getting the video slowed down of him
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:20.320]  in that epic point where he totally flips out.
[2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:22.320]  And it's going to be a major meme we put out.
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:24.320]  It's a major weapon against these people.
[2:13:24.320 --> 2:13:28.320]  And then cut to the women that he's looking at right across the aisle,
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:29.320]  a bunch of his victims.
[2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:31.320]  He can't stand the fact that they've killed their dogs.
[2:13:31.320 --> 2:13:32.320]  They've killed their cats.
[2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:33.320]  They've threatened their family.
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:34.320]  They've had their mortgages taken.
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:36.320]  They've got them fired from jobs.
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:39.320]  He's harassed them for years and they just won't back down.
[2:13:39.320 --> 2:13:43.320]  He can't stand the fact that he's killed so many people
[2:13:43.320 --> 2:13:45.320]  that some people murdered and folks just don't care.
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:47.320]  They're still fighting.
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:49.320]  It's going to be a good day.
[2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:54.320]  It's going to be a good day when I can go to Bill Clinton's grave
[2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:56.320]  and look at it and know justice has been done.
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:13:59.320]  I'm not going to piss on his grave because I don't...
[2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:00.320]  He's a failure.
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:01.320]  I'm sad for him.
[2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:03.320]  He's a very, very wicked, evil person.
[2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:05.320]  He's the type of traitor the global has lifted up
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:09.320]  because he was so empty and so evil and would betray this nation.
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:11.320]  What's got him so scared of Trump?
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:12.320]  They've smelled his spirit.
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:14.320]  They don't like it.
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:16.320]  He hates con artists.
[2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:17.320]  He hates scammers.
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:20.320]  He hates seeing this country run down a rat hole.
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:25.320]  And he is worldly.
[2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:27.320]  I mean, wanting to be wealthy, wanting to be powerful,
[2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:28.320]  but that's not a sin in and of itself.
[2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:34.320]  It can turn into something bad, but he's the ghost of Christmas present.
[2:14:34.320 --> 2:14:36.320]  Prosperity.
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:40.320]  You want to get into an allegory from fiction.
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:45.320]  And they don't like that.
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:49.320]  Let's go ahead.
[2:14:49.320 --> 2:14:51.320]  We've got Lamar, Josh, Dan, Don, Dan.
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:55.320]  Let's go ahead and go to Josh in Pennsylvania and then we'll go to Lamar.
[2:14:55.320 --> 2:14:58.320]  You're on the air, Josh.
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:14:59.320]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:02.320]  Oh, man, I'm, I'm super fired up to the point.
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:03.320]  I can hardly stand it.
[2:15:03.320 --> 2:15:05.320]  I mean, it was great to see that comeback.
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:08.320]  If he stays on the attack for 28 days and just doesn't apologize for anything
[2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:10.320]  and just hammers the hell out of them, he's going to win.
[2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:11.320]  They'll try to steal it.
[2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:13.320]  And I think that'll blow up in their face too.
[2:15:13.320 --> 2:15:14.320]  What do you think?
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:15.320]  Brother, he killed it.
[2:15:15.320 --> 2:15:18.320]  I mean, he, he was, he was exactly what we need.
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:21.320]  There was two points I wanted to say about what happened last night.
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:26.320]  One, uh, when she, you know, she continues to make these negative disparaging remarks
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:27.320]  saying that he's a racist, he's a racist.
[2:15:27.320 --> 2:15:30.320]  I really want him to make the connection of her.
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:31.320]  Could he get it in the first?
[2:15:31.320 --> 2:15:32.320]  Robert Byrd.
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:33.320]  Bring up these.
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:36.320]  Well, but yeah, the super printed remark and then correlate that directly into the
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:38.320]  prison senses that her and her husband helped.
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:40.320]  And the blood selling the age blood.
[2:15:40.320 --> 2:15:41.320]  That's not been brought up.
[2:15:41.320 --> 2:15:42.320]  Yes.
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:43.320]  Yeah, I agree.
[2:15:43.320 --> 2:15:44.320]  I agree.
[2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:45.320]  Those are two things that he needs to kind of focus on.
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:50.320]  And the other thing, you know, my own personal experience, I fought a 10 year fight with
[2:15:50.320 --> 2:15:54.320]  the federal government, but working for a company for six months, it was a housing
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:15:56.320]  market, a mortgage fraud thing.
[2:15:56.320 --> 2:15:59.320]  That being said, after fighting them, I worked for them for six months.
[2:15:59.320 --> 2:16:03.320]  After fighting the government for almost 10 years, I finally had to plead because if I
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:05.320]  didn't plead, they were coming at it for 14 years.
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:07.320]  And it's exactly what he said.
[2:16:07.320 --> 2:16:11.320]  A fifth, if somebody would have done a fifth of what she did, they'd end up in federal
[2:16:11.320 --> 2:16:12.320]  prison.
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:13.320]  My probation.
[2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:14.320]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:17.320]  The average apartment manager routinely has unlead security threatening to arrest him for
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:18.320]  no reason.
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:22.320]  The laws where they can selectively enforce them where nothing's legal, but then they
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:24.320]  let insiders do whatever they want.
[2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:27.320]  And the last thing I want to also talk about too is about the race relations.
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:31.320]  So, you know, my best friend, who and I were both in federal prison together, he's African
[2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:32.320]  American.
[2:16:32.320 --> 2:16:33.320]  Let me tell you.
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:36.320]  Yeah, you just say that you don't really have any black friends that you just say that
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:37.320]  because you're so racist.
[2:16:37.320 --> 2:16:42.320]  Well, that leftist though, they can be liberal and then their, their black friends are real.
[2:16:42.320 --> 2:16:46.320]  Well, the irony is that this is the true racism.
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:50.600]  I've seen more and more, and it's so proliferated in the African American community is African
[2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:52.560]  Americans against other African Americans.
[2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:53.560]  And that's the truth.
[2:16:53.560 --> 2:16:55.320]  And that's something that doesn't want to be brought up because it's.
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:16:56.320]  Yeah.
[2:16:56.320 --> 2:16:57.920]  Why do you think it's an epidemic of black on black crime?
[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:02.040]  I mean, it's, it's been bad for 50 years, but it's really exploding.
[2:17:02.040 --> 2:17:06.560]  I think so much of it also has a lot to do with the way, the media, the way pop culture
[2:17:06.560 --> 2:17:11.320]  is, you know, they, they focus the attention on if you're not a thug or a gangster or doing
[2:17:11.320 --> 2:17:15.320]  something of, of some illegal aspect or being involved in sports, but you're not really
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:16.320]  black.
[2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:17.320]  And that to me is, is absolutely absurd.
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:19.320]  If you're articulate, you're intelligent, you choose.
[2:17:19.320 --> 2:17:20.320]  I don't know.
[2:17:20.320 --> 2:17:23.320]  Have you ever seen crabs at the beach, you catch a bunch of crabs and they don't attack
[2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:24.320]  each other.
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:25.320]  So one tries to get out.
[2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:26.320]  It's the weirdest thing.
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:29.600]  I don't care what crab species it is, when one tries to climb out, they come over and
[2:17:29.600 --> 2:17:30.600]  grab them.
[2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:31.600]  It's amazing.
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:32.600]  And it's horrible.
[2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:38.960]  Look, I, I watched it, my, again, my friend, he, he would get it all the time telling him
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:42.440]  that, you know, he's Uncle Tom, he's whitewashed and his response would be like, why?
[2:17:42.440 --> 2:17:46.720]  Because I chose to not be associated with this, this, this concept of what quote unquote
[2:17:46.720 --> 2:17:47.720]  black America is.
[2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:49.440]  So again, I leave you with that, Alex.
[2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:50.440]  Thank you so much.
[2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:55.120]  Again, by the way, the team that you put together, you know, David Knight, Leanne McAdoo, you
[2:17:55.120 --> 2:17:57.600]  know, Owen Jordan, all these guys, I've been listening to you.
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:18:01.440]  You woke me up in 2006, right before I got indicted, which is ironic.
[2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:04.120]  And I got to tell you, the team you put together is absolutely fantastic.
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:05.120]  Well, I mentioned a team.
[2:18:05.120 --> 2:18:10.480]  I mean, Ashley Beckford's black, you know, her answers are from Africa, she's a human.
[2:18:10.480 --> 2:18:13.920]  He began in these terms, that's the left creates it all about terms, opposite Martin Luther
[2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:14.920]  King.
[2:18:14.920 --> 2:18:17.760]  She goes out and just mildly asked questions about Hillary, white people, you name it,
[2:18:17.760 --> 2:18:19.160]  scream, you're an Uncle Tom.
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:20.440]  They're the big racist.
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:24.240]  And they get off on the fact that they're liberal so they can say whatever they want.
[2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:27.160]  You know, it's like gay people, you know, you're a faggot, you're a queer, you're a
[2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:28.160]  blah, blah, blah.
[2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:29.160]  Anybody else says that it's bad.
[2:18:29.160 --> 2:18:34.240]  And it just perpetuates this whole thing when all they are is actually racist, operating
[2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:37.360]  in a racist world, but saying they're good.
[2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:38.600]  I mean, it's actually crazy.
[2:18:38.600 --> 2:18:41.320]  It's, it's, it's, it's nuts.
[2:18:41.320 --> 2:18:45.200]  Everything we're seeing right now, every, I listen to NPR and it disgusts me because
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:49.160]  this must be nationally public radio and all I hear is embashing Trump.
[2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:54.720]  All they're doing is pushing the race, white privilege, this, you know, it's, it's unbelievable
[2:18:54.720 --> 2:18:56.520]  to be nonstop race baiting that.
[2:18:56.520 --> 2:18:57.520]  Oh yeah.
[2:18:57.520 --> 2:18:59.480]  All they care about is thinking they're in the winning team.
[2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:00.840]  All right, brother.
[2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:01.840]  Great call.
[2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:02.840]  Appreciate your call.
[2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:04.840]  Let's talk to, you know, we're talking about the debate last night.
[2:19:04.840 --> 2:19:06.240]  How'd you think it went?
[2:19:06.240 --> 2:19:07.640]  What's the next dirty trick to come?
[2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:12.800]  Is everybody still in the hoax of Friday that, oh my God, 11 year old tape with some
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:14.920]  raising dogs over.
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:19.000]  This is Donald Trump.
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:20.800]  He's been married to three supermodels.
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:25.320]  He's got a whole bunch of kids.
[2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:26.320]  He doesn't drink.
[2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:27.320]  He doesn't smoke.
[2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:35.520]  He eats big, juicy rib eye steaks and ice cream and eats milkshakes and plays golf and
[2:19:35.520 --> 2:19:36.520]  likes women.
[2:19:36.520 --> 2:19:39.160]  So Bill Clinton likes to rape women.
[2:19:39.160 --> 2:19:40.400]  He likes women.
[2:19:40.400 --> 2:19:43.960]  Hillary likes women, but that's okay that she's in the hotel room with them, Abadian
[2:19:43.960 --> 2:19:45.800]  and she's more tail than toilet seat.
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:46.800]  That's all right.
[2:19:46.800 --> 2:19:51.800]  It's just that Donald Trump is a, you know, I mean, it's, it's hypocrisy.
[2:19:51.800 --> 2:19:52.800]  Okay.
[2:19:52.800 --> 2:19:53.800]  Make him stand down.
[2:19:53.800 --> 2:19:54.800]  Hillary needs to be arrested.
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:20:00.360]  I tell you what, you arrest Hillary, you charge her, then I'll say Trump's a bad guy.
[2:20:00.360 --> 2:20:01.800]  This guy has a speeding ticket.
[2:20:01.800 --> 2:20:05.960]  Donald Trump, this person murdered people, arrest the speeding ticket guy.
[2:20:05.960 --> 2:20:09.240]  It's just insanity.
[2:20:09.240 --> 2:20:10.240]  Lamar and Tennessee.
[2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:11.240]  Thanks for calling.
[2:20:11.240 --> 2:20:12.240]  Hey, Alex.
[2:20:12.240 --> 2:20:15.240]  Good to talk to you again.
[2:20:15.240 --> 2:20:16.240]  Yeah.
[2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:20.320]  I mean, I really wasn't going to vote for Trump and, you know, and not because of all
[2:20:20.320 --> 2:20:25.320]  the typical nonsense that you hear people say that he's a racist and his taxes and all
[2:20:25.320 --> 2:20:26.720]  this kind of ridiculous stuff.
[2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:27.720]  But that he's too liberal?
[2:20:27.720 --> 2:20:28.720]  Was it because he's too liberal?
[2:20:28.720 --> 2:20:30.720]  Because that, I mean, that could be true.
[2:20:30.720 --> 2:20:31.720]  No.
[2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:35.720]  I mean, I'm very libertarian and I feel like he could have eased it.
[2:20:35.720 --> 2:20:40.880]  He easily won this election by tweaking his campaign a little bit and really preaching
[2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:45.880]  about adhering to the Constitution and all the things I wanted to hear, I was, I was
[2:20:45.880 --> 2:20:48.080]  never quite hearing out of him.
[2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:49.080]  And so I was...
[2:20:49.080 --> 2:20:50.920]  Well, I mean, he did say a lot of that in fairness.
[2:20:50.920 --> 2:20:52.080]  The media didn't cover it.
[2:20:52.080 --> 2:20:54.960]  I've seen incredible things he said that never get on the news.
[2:20:54.960 --> 2:20:57.240]  So in fairness, have you been following his speeches?
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:20:58.240]  Yeah.
[2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:01.880]  I mean, I listened to him a lot and I don't agree with him on, I still, I don't agree
[2:21:01.880 --> 2:21:04.600]  with him on a lot of things, you know, like Edward Snowden and every...
[2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:05.800]  I agree with you there.
[2:21:05.800 --> 2:21:06.800]  I agree.
[2:21:06.800 --> 2:21:09.600]  He shouldn't be talking about the torture, but it's also then good that he's so honest
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:10.600]  about it.
[2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:11.600]  He's like, we're doing it.
[2:21:11.600 --> 2:21:12.600]  They're terrorists.
[2:21:12.600 --> 2:21:13.600]  You know, he needs to change that.
[2:21:13.600 --> 2:21:14.600]  I agree.
[2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:15.600]  Yeah.
[2:21:15.600 --> 2:21:22.040]  And so, you know, I was looking, always, always looking for some kind of a cue or signal,
[2:21:22.040 --> 2:21:25.760]  you know, to say, okay, is this guy really his own man?
[2:21:25.760 --> 2:21:30.840]  Is he really going to follow through at least with the things we can agree on?
[2:21:30.840 --> 2:21:38.520]  And when he, on live national TV in the middle of the debate, went against his own running
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:42.760]  mate, you know, Mike Pence, I personally was not that happy that he picked.
[2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:45.080]  I was looking for somebody older, more edgy and...
[2:21:45.080 --> 2:21:46.080]  But I don't think that's...
[2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:48.560]  You like the fact he said we don't even have war with Russia?
[2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:49.560]  Exactly.
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:50.560]  Exactly.
[2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:51.560]  100%...
[2:21:51.560 --> 2:21:52.560]  No, listen, listen, listen, listen.
[2:21:52.560 --> 2:21:54.760]  Listen, he's got problems and he's very picketed, okay?
[2:21:54.760 --> 2:21:55.760]  That's why they hate him.
[2:21:55.760 --> 2:21:56.760]  He's for real.
[2:21:56.760 --> 2:21:59.800]  Now, he has some views that I think are wrong, but he thinks are right.
[2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:01.600]  Let me tell you, he's for real, man.
[2:22:01.600 --> 2:22:02.760]  He wants to make us prosperous.
[2:22:02.760 --> 2:22:04.680]  He doesn't want to attack people that aren't our enemies.
[2:22:04.680 --> 2:22:07.320]  He has a real sense of justice, okay?
[2:22:07.320 --> 2:22:08.720]  And that's why they're so scared of him, bro.
[2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:09.720]  So I'm glad you're seeing that.
[2:22:09.720 --> 2:22:10.720]  Go ahead.
[2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:15.440]  Yeah, anybody that falls for this thing about Russia, I mean, you really got to be simple-minded.
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:16.440]  You're the most gullible.
[2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:20.120]  I mean, this whole thing about Russia is, is manipulating our elected...
[2:22:20.120 --> 2:22:23.400]  Yeah, no, I mean, Russia in the 50s was trying to take us over.
[2:22:23.400 --> 2:22:26.000]  Russia is falling apart.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:27.720]  They're trying to become free market.
[2:22:27.720 --> 2:22:30.480]  They're promoting Christianity and having kids.
[2:22:30.480 --> 2:22:34.600]  They're the opposite of the leftist globalist system, and that's why the leftists hate him.
[2:22:34.600 --> 2:22:41.360]  Yeah, and I think now that he's done that, he's kind of put himself in the box.
[2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:42.600]  He can't go back on that one.
[2:22:42.600 --> 2:22:45.120]  I mean, he threw his running mate on top of it.
[2:22:45.120 --> 2:22:48.760]  Well, let me tell you, if the Russians pull anything, and there's different camps, they
[2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:52.400]  may do something, you know, some military provocation Putin doesn't know about.
[2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:55.280]  There's lots of sabotage.
[2:22:55.280 --> 2:22:57.960]  Trump will get angry, and we'll do it, and we'll go with his generals.
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:23:00.600]  The good news is, he's got the best generals there are advising.
[2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:01.600]  He's not an idiot.
[2:23:01.600 --> 2:23:02.600]  He's an executive.
[2:23:02.600 --> 2:23:03.600]  He goes, gets the top people.
[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:06.640]  I mean, let's say, Trump's going to change the world if he gets in.
[2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:08.320]  They're probably going to kill him.
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:11.320]  And so I'm glad you're starting to, I mean, when I'm getting there as Lamar, you weren't
[2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:13.000]  going to be for Trump, but now you are.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:14.880]  Right, definitely not.
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:19.320]  I was not, and I only am because of this one thing that gives me a little bit of that.
[2:23:19.320 --> 2:23:20.320]  And that's enough, isn't it?
[2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:21.320]  Not having World War III.
[2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:22.320]  God bless you.
[2:23:22.320 --> 2:23:23.320]  I appreciate your...
[2:23:23.320 --> 2:23:24.320]  Absolutely.
[2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:28.680]  That are reasonable people, top liberal professors that, you know, head up the Russian studies
[2:23:28.680 --> 2:23:30.920]  through it and say, we need Trump.
[2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:32.160]  This guy's good.
[2:23:32.160 --> 2:23:39.440]  I mean, the neocons that run Obama and Hillary are crazy people.
[2:23:39.440 --> 2:23:43.880]  The guy they followed out of Chicago Business School was a Nazi, and man, that's what gets
[2:23:43.880 --> 2:23:44.880]  really weird.
[2:23:44.880 --> 2:23:47.800]  Like, some of these guys are like Jewish, Russians, and stuff that were Trotsky guys.
[2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:52.880]  Then there's like weird Nazis, and then this weird Nazi guy, Spear, and they're over there
[2:23:52.880 --> 2:23:56.840]  at Chicago Business Center, and justifies the mean Machiavellian, and they're just...
[2:23:56.840 --> 2:24:01.600]  These students went to this and just got whacked out, man, and so much of our problems come
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:04.200]  out of this.
[2:24:04.200 --> 2:24:11.920]  I mean, you mix Nazism with Communism, and then weird Jewish socialism, I mean, it's
[2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:14.400]  just nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty.
[2:24:14.400 --> 2:24:17.360]  And of course, there are a lot of neocons that aren't Jews, because all you're saying
[2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:21.600]  is the fact that it's a Jewish contingent of weirdo-Nazis, and then that's what I'm saying.
[2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:22.600]  It's so weird.
[2:24:22.600 --> 2:24:27.440]  It's like George Soros, he made his first, you know, hundred million robbing Jews for
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:28.440]  the Nazis.
[2:24:28.440 --> 2:24:33.920]  It's like the worst, it's just, it's just, and I have liberal Jews go, well, he had
[2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:36.920]  to or they'd kill him, and I'm like, I'm not gonna, somebody said, we're gonna kill you
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:39.320]  if you don't say, go kill Mexicans.
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:42.400]  I'd say, well, pull the freaking trigger, dumbass, ain't doing it.
[2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:46.360]  You know, it's this idea of like, he was gonna, no he wasn't, he went, his dab is involved
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:47.360]  with him.
[2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:51.120]  He was a piece of crap, he could have gotten out of the country.
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:55.800]  I mean, George Soros is a monster.
[2:24:55.800 --> 2:24:58.480]  Dan in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:02.600]  Hey, Alex, good long-term subscriber, first-time caller.
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:04.440]  Thank you for the support, brother.
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:06.600]  Yeah, you've got to always have.
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:12.320]  Listen, I just want to preface this by saying, you know, I'm a non-Christian, but I saw something
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:16.000]  today that was forwarded to me that I just had to share with you, and it's a prophetic
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:17.800]  picture of Donald Trump.
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:24.200]  And this minister's talking about being, saw a little blurb on Trump being the 45th President
[2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:27.080]  of the United States, which he would be.
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:30.240]  And he was called to read Isaiah 45.
[2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:36.320]  And the funny thing about Isaiah 45 is it references Cyrus, who is a heathen king, anointed
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:40.800]  by God to protect the Jews and rebuild Jerusalem.
[2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:44.320]  Who does that remind you of?
[2:25:44.320 --> 2:25:50.080]  Trump is no preacher, but he may be just an anointed guy that's going to disrupt this
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:51.080]  whole thing.
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:52.080]  I totally agree.
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:53.080]  No, that's what my, that's it.
[2:25:53.080 --> 2:25:55.280]  That's it.
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:25:57.800]  That is exactly how, that is exactly how the universe works.
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:01.400]  I mean, I've experienced this, this, I mean, because you consider it say, I hate these
[2:26:01.400 --> 2:26:03.440]  preachers, I hate these fake religious people.
[2:26:03.440 --> 2:26:04.640]  Of course it's bull.
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:06.800]  But then there's weird stuff in the universe going on.
[2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:08.120]  I've experienced it.
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:09.120]  God's real.
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:11.600]  It's, it's, it's, it's, whatever you want to call it, there's providence.
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:12.600]  There's, it's energy.
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:17.560]  It's, it's, it's a will and, and that's, I mean, you look at like, Revelation talks
[2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:19.720]  about the Trump and all of it.
[2:26:19.720 --> 2:26:23.800]  It's very, very biblical, but, but, but I haven't seen that.
[2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:24.800]  Let's pull up.
[2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:26.000]  What is this particular graphic?
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.400]  What, what's the name of us we can pull up for folks?
[2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:32.480]  Well, the article was on charisma dot charisma news dot com.
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:38.960]  It was forwarded to me by my son who's in a pastor and the thing just stood out of me
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:44.400]  when it said a prophetic picture of Donald Trump and it, when you read what it says,
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:50.880]  how, how, uh, Isaiah, uh, 150 years before Cyrus's birth declared through the prophet
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:56.600]  Isaiah that a foreign man and non-June names, Cyrus would be anointed shepherd of his people
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:00.880]  and rebuild Jerusalem beginning in the first day with the house of the Lord.
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:05.840]  I read through this and I go again, I'm not a Christian, but I think a prophecy is, uh,
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:11.160]  fascinating and if you don't keep your eyes and ears open, you're not going to hear things
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:15.840]  that just might be a guy's, let's pull up as I have 45 on TV if we can.
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:16.840]  There it is.
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:20.040]  Prophecy God sent Donald Trump to wage war against destructive spirits.
[2:27:20.040 --> 2:27:21.400]  You scroll down and that's it.
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:22.400]  He wants to build.
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:23.400]  But they get it.
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:25.640]  He wants to build.
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:27.120]  He wants to be prosperous.
[2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:28.920]  That's what God gives you.
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:31.600]  That's the fruits and he's not perfect.
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:34.440]  The enemy wants to tear us down and then rule us.
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:37.840]  Let's put it back on screen for Isaiah and I'll go back to you, but I want to read this
[2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:40.320]  because since you mentioned it, can we put that back on screen?
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:41.480]  Thanks guys.
[2:27:41.480 --> 2:27:42.480]  It goes on.
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:43.480]  Uh, and yeah, there it is.
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:44.480]  Absolutely.
[2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:45.480]  Isaiah 45.
[2:27:45.480 --> 2:27:46.480]  That is really wild.
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:47.480]  Isn't it?
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:54.080]  I, you know, I figured God can use any tool he wants to use and so I just, I saw this
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:57.360]  and the first thing I thought of as I was listening this morning, I got a call.
[2:27:57.360 --> 2:27:58.360]  I got a call.
[2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:01.920]  Our brother down there in Texas and get there, but you say you don't, you're not a Christian.
[2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:06.080]  I mean, I would say I don't believe in this religious system, but I believe in Christ.
[2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:12.280]  Well, I, again, I'm, I'm, I'm a nonbeliever, but I always have my eyes and ears open because
[2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:16.360]  you know, sir, what happens if you say have a dream and then a month later, the exact dream
[2:28:16.360 --> 2:28:17.360]  comes true?
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:18.360]  There you go.
[2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:21.520]  But have you ever had that experience?
[2:28:21.520 --> 2:28:27.840]  I have had that experience where I feel like I'm being talked to, uh, and, and, and again,
[2:28:27.840 --> 2:28:30.880]  I, I question it, uh, where's that coming from?
[2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:35.360]  I know, but I mean, a lot of people, I've had dreams, okay, where a hundred percent
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:36.480]  it comes true.
[2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:41.480]  And when it's happening, like I had a dream a month or so before, I was like, this weird
[2:28:41.480 --> 2:28:46.120]  dream of this guy with a pink and green striped polo shirt, and I'm walking around this building.
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:47.920]  I don't know why I'm there.
[2:28:47.920 --> 2:28:52.280]  And then he comes out and mugs me, attacks me.
[2:28:52.280 --> 2:28:55.720]  And then as it happened, it was just so surreal.
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:28:57.160]  And I've had those dreams over and over again.
[2:28:57.160 --> 2:28:58.280]  I mean, I've told people this.
[2:28:58.280 --> 2:28:59.280]  I had dreams.
[2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:00.280]  They built the World Trade Center.
[2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:01.280]  I didn't say that on air at the time.
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:03.440]  I said, they're going to build the World Trade Center and blame it a lot and launch this
[2:29:03.440 --> 2:29:04.960]  big war on July 25th.
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:05.960]  It's, I mean, it's on video.
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:06.960]  It's on YouTube.
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:09.800]  And, you know, I kept having dreams of the towers collapsing and blowing up.
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:12.480]  I didn't tell anybody that, but my wife at the time, and she's like, what, they're going
[2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:13.480]  to blow the towers up.
[2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:14.480]  And I went on air and said it.
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:15.480]  I said, they're going to blow the towers up.
[2:29:15.480 --> 2:29:18.080]  But I mean, I, I saw that, you know, so what, what's going on?
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:24.280]  Let me tell you, there's a lot going on in the books, uh, to quote, uh, William Shakespeare.
[2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:26.960]  I forget it's like a Horatio or one of those.
[2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:31.880]  They kind of repeated master and commander, like as soon as they throw the guy's body
[2:29:31.880 --> 2:29:35.040]  overboard and he's dead, all the bad luck ends and the, and the wind comes back and
[2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:37.560]  they say, whoa, he goes, he goes, he says, the doctor, match her.
[2:29:37.560 --> 2:29:42.480]  And he goes, yeah, a lot of stuff in the world, it in your books, buddy, we'll be back.
[2:29:42.480 --> 2:29:48.800]  I think what Dr. Pachinic said last time, then he's quoting Bismarck, God loves, but
[2:29:48.800 --> 2:29:54.280]  we'll, we'll quote when we come back on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones
[2:29:54.280 --> 2:30:02.920]  and the GCN radio network George Soros isn't happy with Russian president
[2:30:02.920 --> 2:30:06.920]  Vladimir Putin for his quote, heinous crimes against humanity in Syria.
[2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:12.120]  Soros said, the world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe of historic proportions and it's
[2:30:12.120 --> 2:30:14.400]  being perpetuated by the president of Russia.
[2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:15.400]  Oh, really?
[2:30:15.400 --> 2:30:19.760]  Well, the war awards continued as Soros alleged that Russian aircraft is targeting civilians
[2:30:19.760 --> 2:30:22.680]  in Aleppo to assist Syrian forces on the ground.
[2:30:22.680 --> 2:30:27.880]  Aleppo, as we know, is a known ISIS stronghold and the Russians at the invitation of the
[2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:32.320]  sovereign government of Syria have launched a bombing campaign against ISIS.
[2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:36.600]  The Russians successfully retook the ancient city of Palmyra from the Islamic State, something
[2:30:36.600 --> 2:30:38.160]  we failed to do.
[2:30:38.160 --> 2:30:41.880]  Symbolically, of course, the recapture of Palmyra means that there are defenders of
[2:30:41.880 --> 2:30:43.920]  civilization over barbarism.
[2:30:43.920 --> 2:30:45.160]  We just have words.
[2:30:45.160 --> 2:30:49.640]  Where was Soros in the 1990s when Madeleine Albright stressed the human collateral damage
[2:30:49.640 --> 2:30:53.760]  of 500,000 Iraqi children was, quote, worth it to us?
[2:30:53.760 --> 2:30:56.520]  We must question why he suddenly cares so much now.
[2:30:56.520 --> 2:31:00.280]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:01.720]  Clean pure drinking water.
[2:31:01.720 --> 2:31:03.240]  You can't survive without it.
[2:31:03.240 --> 2:31:04.360]  But where do you get it?
[2:31:04.360 --> 2:31:09.360]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is

[2:33:08.080 --> 2:33:14.240]  That's our theme of the day, October 10th, 2016.
[2:33:14.240 --> 2:33:19.440]  Only 28 days left as the world watches the people of the United States attempt to break
[2:33:19.440 --> 2:33:22.480]  away from the new World War and global governance.
[2:33:22.480 --> 2:33:30.840]  This is self-determination, 1776 in the year 2016.
[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:32.680]  Raping America's is 93.
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:37.120]  We're up to $30,000 now and paying out the folks that have raided Clinton events.
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:40.720]  Paying Bill Clinton's or rapist wearing a rake shirt available at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:33:40.720 --> 2:33:43.840]  Now, we're not going to sell enough of the shirt probably to pay off the deal.
[2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:44.840]  I don't care.
[2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:49.480]  I'm all-in spending everything I've got, all our reserves against the enemy right now.
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:52.760]  Promote nationalism and sovereignty and liberty worldwide.
[2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:55.040]  I am all-in committed at every level.
[2:33:55.040 --> 2:34:00.440]  I promise we'll finish up with Mike, Don, Steve, and Dan with Dr. Pachennick.
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:04.680]  We'll go five minutes the next hour and then hand the baton to David Knight with more highlights
[2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:05.680]  from last night.
[2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:08.320]  We're going to talk to Pachennick here just a moment, but before I go any further, there
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:09.320]  is a new WikiLeaks.
[2:34:09.320 --> 2:34:14.080]  In fact, I accidentally left it in my office dealing with dead bodies.
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:17.800]  I was told Biggs was bringing it over, so so much is happening.
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:20.680]  There's also a new WikiLeaks, so just have them bring it to me again.
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:21.680]  It's not here.
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:22.680]  Thanks.
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:28.920]  New WikiLeaks emails, Clinton campaign insiders, fears Bill's sex life could sink Hillary and
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:32.560]  they're in there talking about covering it up, the rapes, all the rest of it.
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:36.000]  That's why they're preparing all this to go after Trump.
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:39.440]  By the way, I've done investigations into Trump with women that he was formerly known
[2:34:39.440 --> 2:34:40.440]  to be with.
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:42.720]  I'm just going to be honest before I endorse him over here ago.
[2:34:42.720 --> 2:34:43.880]  And I talked to Hollywood folks.
[2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:45.880]  He's very straight-laced.
[2:34:45.880 --> 2:34:52.640]  He's a one-woman man and he is super conservative privately.
[2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:56.480]  And then when he's around liberals and stuff, he'll kind of do some of this jocular talk.
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:34:58.160]  But he's really listened to it.
[2:34:58.160 --> 2:34:59.160]  I thought he was really beautiful.
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:00.960]  I wanted to take her and buy her furniture.
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:04.760]  That's how he thinks he gets women, not putting Trump down, but it sounds a little amateurish
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:05.760]  for me.
[2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:12.600]  They turn this into this giant, ridiculous garbage when Hillary is helping pedophiles
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:14.440]  cover up their rape of 12-year-olds.
[2:35:14.440 --> 2:35:16.520]  She admits she knew he was guilty.
[2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:26.000]  Funding jihadis, all the sexual crimes, Bill Clinton, with the rapes being settled.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:30.160]  We're pouring through the latest WikiLeaks that came out today, so look for more in the
[2:35:30.160 --> 2:35:35.560]  next few hours from Boyman Thall and others.
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:37.640]  It talks about a lot of bodies being buried.
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:40.360]  Now, does that signify literal bodies?
[2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:41.520]  Well, yeah.
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:46.160]  Or metaphoric bodies, things that are hidden.
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:47.160]  I'm not going to blame her.
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:48.160]  This is, I want to go to Pachinic.
[2:35:48.160 --> 2:35:49.160]  I want to go to your calls.
[2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:51.640]  But we're illicit-supported.
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:56.320]  We developed a bio-true, and that's a term I came up with, not a scientist, but a scientist
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:36:01.800]  saying, no, this is the most bioavailable mustard seed processed in a cold format, not
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:04.240]  heated up, not adulterated.
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:07.160]  It's just, it's ridiculously strong.
[2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:08.160]  I'll be honest.
[2:36:08.160 --> 2:36:09.160]  I'm just going to be honest.
[2:36:09.160 --> 2:36:10.160]  Everybody loves brain force.
[2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:12.000]  It sells more than this.
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.120]  To each man, his own.
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:16.280]  One man's poisons, another person's ambrosia.
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:17.440]  I like brain force.
[2:36:17.440 --> 2:36:18.440]  It's great.
[2:36:18.440 --> 2:36:21.600]  It's got some stuff that's, you know, prescription in Europe.
[2:36:21.600 --> 2:36:22.600]  It's amazing.
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:23.600]  It's healthy.
[2:36:23.600 --> 2:36:24.600]  It's great.
[2:36:24.600 --> 2:36:28.800]  I don't like it as much, and it makes me a little irritable.
[2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:31.760]  Selenium is this trace element involved in electrochemical activities in the brain and
[2:36:31.760 --> 2:36:32.760]  all their cells.
[2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:33.760]  You die without it.
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:36.680]  Most people are heavily deficient in it.
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:38.960]  Last night I was exhausted after being on air five, six hours.
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:39.960]  I had to go another hour.
[2:36:39.960 --> 2:36:41.960]  I went, oh yeah, don't drink coffee.
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:45.240]  I'm going to drink coffee now, pretty much, maybe once a week, if I'm having breakfast
[2:36:45.240 --> 2:36:46.240]  for the flavor.
[2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:48.560]  I take selenium.
[2:36:48.560 --> 2:36:54.000]  So it's kind of, for me, in my physiology, in my biology, my metabolic system better
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:58.240]  than our new tropic brain force, but not to each person on their own, but super mild
[2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:03.200]  vitality, the bio-trystallineum, 23% off DNA force with the bio-PQQ, the CoQ, Tenant
[2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:10.680]  More, infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, the Coltel 3, 888-253-3139.
[2:37:10.680 --> 2:37:13.160]  And we're going to end the Hillary for Prison shirt because, you know, it's a great idea
[2:37:13.160 --> 2:37:14.440]  we launched over a year ago.
[2:37:14.440 --> 2:37:15.440]  It's a huge meme.
[2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:16.640]  Trump brought it up last night.
[2:37:16.640 --> 2:37:17.640]  It's great.
[2:37:17.640 --> 2:37:19.200]  I just, all good things come to an end.
[2:37:19.200 --> 2:37:20.200]  Everybody else is copying it.
[2:37:20.200 --> 2:37:21.200]  That's fine.
[2:37:21.200 --> 2:37:26.920]  It's original with the red infowars on the shoulder and the legalizedfreedomonthebackinfowars.com.
[2:37:26.920 --> 2:37:30.160]  Get it today and the profit we make will fund the operation.
[2:37:30.160 --> 2:37:31.160]  We need the funding.
[2:37:31.160 --> 2:37:32.280]  Thank you all for your support.
[2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:33.560]  You see what we're doing.
[2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:34.560]  Thank you for your prayers.
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:38.440]  There isn't a better place to put your support in.
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:39.440]  I don't say that arrogantly.
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:40.440]  I say that humbly.
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:44.720]  I cannot believe we are the most effective force out there other than DrudgeReport.com.
[2:37:44.720 --> 2:37:47.360]  I wish there was 10 other groups more effective.
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:50.000]  It is a creepy feeling, but it's also very good.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:54.840]  You know, frankly, as a man, I put it all on the line, the ballrogs coming across the
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:56.400]  bridge, I don't care.
[2:37:56.400 --> 2:37:57.960]  It's actually, I'm really alive.
[2:37:57.960 --> 2:38:01.600]  I feel guilty if they do something to me for my kids, but just what, I'm all in.
[2:38:01.600 --> 2:38:02.600]  It's done.
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:03.600]  It's done.
[2:38:03.600 --> 2:38:04.600]  I'm going next level attack.
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:05.840]  I'm not pulling any punches.
[2:38:05.840 --> 2:38:10.080]  I'm going my gut, my research, my heart, my intellect, and I'm just all in.
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:14.400]  That's why you see we're even more aggressive now, because I am a madman now, 18 hours
[2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:15.400]  a day.
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:16.400]  I am not stopping.
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:18.800]  I'm going all the way right through this election, no matter what happens, the fight
[2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:19.800]  is on.
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:24.320]  So call it all, allwarchlifes.com and fourstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:31.300]  You can feel the spirit of liberty and renaissance in America rising and liberty is rising worldwide.
[2:38:31.300 --> 2:38:34.560]  The evil is rising as well against it, but it is an epic kind of alive.
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:37.520]  I love it when michellick wants to come on because I'm just trying to get him on.
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:40.900]  Former head of psychological warfare for the state department, he'll have positions at
[2:38:40.900 --> 2:38:42.080]  the state department or for other agencies.
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:44.360]  Help found was general boyc and Delta force.
[2:38:44.360 --> 2:38:48.080]  Bestselling author, Tom Clancy's co writer and was the main source and positive character
[2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:50.320]  Jack Ryan over through countries, blah, blah, blah.
[2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:51.400]  We need to go into all that.
[2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:52.320]  People know he's a smart guy.
[2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:54.480]  They've seen how much he talked about come true.
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:56.080]  I'll tell you, he wasn't really a real popular guest
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:57.640]  15 years ago.
[2:38:57.640 --> 2:38:58.840]  He's like CFR and stuff.
[2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:00.920]  He's out of that now, but people didn't get it.
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:02.440]  Now they really love and listen to it
[2:39:02.440 --> 2:39:04.520]  because they get, he really knows what he's talking about.
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:05.600]  So we don't have a lot of time.
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:07.040]  I got callers I promised we'll go to,
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:08.960]  but just to just stalt a snapshot.
[2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:10.240]  I don't know your view yet.
[2:39:10.240 --> 2:39:11.680]  SteveBachennick.com.
[2:39:11.680 --> 2:39:13.760]  What, we'll put your Twitter up as well.
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:14.960]  What was your view on last night?
[2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:17.720]  I think he was himself, he was devastating.
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:19.160]  It was perfectly done.
[2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:20.280]  I'm afraid they're gonna kill him.
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:21.520]  I mean, this is beautiful.
[2:39:21.520 --> 2:39:24.680]  Well, let me just say thanks for allowing me to come on again.
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:27.040]  I'm fighting with you and the people,
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:29.880]  but I thought it was brilliant.
[2:39:29.880 --> 2:39:32.600]  This was exactly what I was waiting for.
[2:39:32.600 --> 2:39:36.680]  I have to thank Steve Brennan and Josh Kushner
[2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:39.600]  for doing the most brilliant psychological operation.
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:42.840]  I've seen in a long time putting the four women there
[2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:46.000]  before the debate, putting them while he,
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:49.920]  during the debate, and Trump was on the offense.
[2:39:49.920 --> 2:39:52.440]  He was polite, he was direct,
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:55.400]  and he clearly stated what the issues were.
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:56.240]  He was like a surgeon,
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:39:57.400]  because I know you're a doctor.
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:39:59.640]  That's correct, it was a surgical strike,
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:02.880]  irrespective of all the nonsense about
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:05.680]  the comments afterwards, which were nonsensical.
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:10.320]  What Trump was providing was the voice for our revolution,
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:13.280]  which is far greater than the Republican Party.
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:16.000]  And as I've said repeatedly, over a year and a half,
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:18.360]  the Republican Party is finished.
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:19.960]  It's not relevant.
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:23.680]  We who have fought from the day one since 9-11
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:26.360]  and created the Tea Party that helped you
[2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:27.600]  with the Alex Jones show,
[2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:31.480]  have now a spokesperson for that revolution.
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:33.480]  That revolution will continue.
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:35.160]  He indicted Hillary.
[2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:37.840]  He said, you're going to prison, he was right.
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:39.480]  She is going to prison.
[2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:43.320]  Ironically, call me if the FBI, the only success
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:47.480]  he's ever had, besides destroying the FBI,
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:49.400]  destroying the Department of Justice,
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:52.360]  was to indict and convict Martha Stewart
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:55.200]  for obstruction of justice and lying.
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:40:56.360]  Can you believe that?
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:40:58.880]  But he couldn't do that for Hillary Clinton.
[2:40:58.880 --> 2:41:02.280]  Trump brought out the fact that the,
[2:41:02.280 --> 2:41:07.160]  what's the name, John Brennan, the DNI,
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:09.720]  Loretta Lynch, of the Attorney General,
[2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:11.240]  the entire system.
[2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:13.360]  He brought up Hillary supporting rapists.
[2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:15.040]  He brought up how they're working with ISIS.
[2:41:15.040 --> 2:41:16.200]  He just, he was-
[2:41:16.200 --> 2:41:18.320]  Well, he enumerated the whole thing
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:21.040]  and the liberal press cannot handle it.
[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:23.440]  But I want to go back a little bit before,
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:27.720]  Bill Clinton, if there is a history
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:31.920]  in the Democratic Party of fornication in the White House,
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:33.800]  let's start with LBJ,
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:36.640]  who continuously seduced a group of women.
[2:41:36.640 --> 2:41:37.800]  We're a candidate.
[2:41:37.800 --> 2:41:38.680]  Well, well, wait.
[2:41:38.680 --> 2:41:40.800]  Before that, more importantly,
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:44.160]  because LBJ seduced Doris Kearns Goodwin,
[2:41:44.160 --> 2:41:47.200]  this beloved historian of the left wing
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:50.240]  who continuously writes about Lincoln.
[2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:53.840]  Then you have JFK, who was an Addison's disease,
[2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:56.240]  had amphetamines, vitamins,
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:41:59.720]  and shots on a daily basis was not a good lover.
[2:41:59.720 --> 2:42:02.800]  Repeatedly had women in the White House.
[2:42:02.800 --> 2:42:04.960]  And let me quote Colin Powell,
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:07.160]  General Colin Powell, who said
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:10.040]  that Hillary is a disaster with hubris.
[2:42:10.040 --> 2:42:13.400]  No matter what she touches, it always gets screwed up.
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:16.320]  And he then added, excuse my language,
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:19.160]  and her husband's continuously dicking women
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:20.560]  in their household.
[2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:21.400]  That's Colin Powell.
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:22.760]  Well, also, I mean, it's confirmed
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:24.520]  by everybody, Secret Service, FBI,
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:26.800]  Blackwater folks, special forces that have guarded her.
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:28.880]  They said she blows up constantly.
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:30.720]  We're talking carpet chewing,
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:32.560]  gilks screaming, yelling over nothing.
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:36.000]  She's, as a psychiatrist, what is these blow-ups?
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:36.840]  She is sick.
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:39.480]  As a psychiatrist, I have said repeatedly,
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:42.360]  and as a neurologist, she has Parkinsonism.
[2:42:42.360 --> 2:42:46.280]  She cannot run for the presidency of the United States.
[2:42:46.280 --> 2:42:50.240]  I, again, compel her doctor, who was a disaster,
[2:42:50.240 --> 2:42:53.600]  and her diagnosis, and Columbia Physician Surgeon,
[2:42:53.600 --> 2:42:56.240]  to release the information to show
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:42:57.800]  that she has Parkinsonism.
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:42:59.400]  You could see yesterday.
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:01.800]  She continuously smiled, looked up.
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:02.640]  She had to sit down.
[2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:03.600]  She had to, I forgot that.
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:04.440]  She had to sit down, basically.
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:07.080]  She had to sit down, but remember the same man
[2:43:07.080 --> 2:43:11.160]  who ends up as the CIA guy to fix her panel,
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:13.200]  was there at the end all the time.
[2:43:13.200 --> 2:43:15.240]  She has to read her answers.
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:19.720]  She could not handle an active, vigorous campaign.
[2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:21.040]  She has not flown.
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:22.240]  She cannot fly.
[2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:25.960]  She cannot really exert any energy
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:27.160]  throughout an eight-hour day.
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:28.000]  Exactly.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.200]  She's gonna be off for 20 days, they announced last week.
[2:43:30.200 --> 2:43:32.120]  We're like, fifth, we're like five in.
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:34.600]  You know, this is a crime,
[2:43:34.600 --> 2:43:37.160]  and this is where the FBI individuals
[2:43:37.160 --> 2:43:40.600]  have to break out, the CIA has to break out,
[2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:43.120]  the military officers have to break out.
[2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:45.400]  Exactly, now is the time to start disregarding
[2:43:45.400 --> 2:43:47.280]  this criminal group that's hijacked the country.
[2:43:47.280 --> 2:43:49.920]  If you're an American, this is not mutiny.
[2:43:49.920 --> 2:43:52.280]  We have to stop going with these people.
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:53.800]  No, this is not mutiny at all.
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:43:56.880]  This is a real revolution in a way
[2:43:56.880 --> 2:43:59.400]  that we haven't seen since 1776,
[2:43:59.400 --> 2:44:03.480]  because corruption has permeated the Republican Party
[2:44:03.480 --> 2:44:07.640]  through this defeat in significant man, Paul Ryan,
[2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:09.440]  and the other man, Frank and Coff.
[2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:10.280]  It was so-
[2:44:10.280 --> 2:44:11.840]  Isn't that an endorsement of Trump
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:15.280]  that he has these horrible neocons and these nobodies
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:17.720]  and these sycophants of the establishment against him?
[2:44:17.720 --> 2:44:18.760]  That's a good thing.
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:21.520]  I think it's brilliant because what he has done
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:25.480]  is to recapitulate the fact that all these neocons,
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:29.000]  the Wolfowitz, the Pearls, the Steve Hadley,
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:32.160]  the John Bolton's, none of whom served in our military,
[2:44:32.160 --> 2:44:35.880]  all of whom avoided our service in Vietnam,
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:39.840]  nevertheless, under the auspices of the Israeli Mossad,
[2:44:39.840 --> 2:44:43.240]  have come to the United States with dual citizenship,
[2:44:43.240 --> 2:44:47.800]  including Murdoch, Giuliani's right-hand prosecutor,
[2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:50.400]  and created a 9-11 standout.
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:53.320]  This is still the effect of what happened
[2:44:53.320 --> 2:44:56.520]  when America realized, thanks to you and others,
[2:44:56.520 --> 2:44:59.880]  that we had our own government kill our own people.
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:01.400]  This is the aftermath.
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:05.560]  But the Republican Party is so stupid, so inept,
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:07.560]  that they can't put a handle around it.
[2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:09.360]  They didn't realize they knew what was going on.
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:10.200]  I agree.
[2:45:10.200 --> 2:45:11.560]  Okay, so we've done forced modem on this.
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:14.040]  How do you expect them, with 27 and a half days,
[2:45:14.040 --> 2:45:16.040]  to strike back a false flag?
[2:45:16.040 --> 2:45:16.880]  They try to kill him?
[2:45:16.880 --> 2:45:19.120]  A fake false flag on Hillary?
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:21.800]  More fake lawsuits with Jane does?
[2:45:21.800 --> 2:45:23.600]  Yeah, they can try whatever false flag.
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:24.880]  It's now irrelevant.
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:27.000]  Hillary's not even relevant anymore.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:28.960]  She is sick and capable of-
[2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:30.000]  But she is relevant,
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:32.080]  that they would try to put that walking corpse in,
[2:45:32.080 --> 2:45:33.920]  shows how arrogant the establishment is.
[2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:36.200]  Well, they can put whatever corpse they want,
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:37.800]  but Trump will blow it out.
[2:45:37.800 --> 2:45:40.840]  Now I understand that he really does understand
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:44.720]  psychological warfare, and he is effectively using it,
[2:45:44.720 --> 2:45:45.560]  and will continue-
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:46.400]  Well, let me give you the news then.
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:47.240]  You may not know this,
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:48.080]  you probably do with your sources.
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:51.080]  I've confirmed, he got convinced by family,
[2:45:51.080 --> 2:45:52.240]  the Clintons lied to them and said,
[2:45:52.240 --> 2:45:54.760]  let's play nice, let's not go there.
[2:45:54.760 --> 2:45:56.920]  That's why he did that at the last debate.
[2:45:56.920 --> 2:45:58.200]  Now he understands,
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:00.480]  and he's told some of his family that meanwhile,
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:01.320]  it shows he's a good guy,
[2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:02.160]  it listens to his family,
[2:46:02.160 --> 2:46:03.000]  but it's also kind of a bad thing.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.480]  He just said, look, sit down, watch what I do.
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:06.960]  So now we're seeing Trump be Trump,
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:08.520]  and he needs to just stay that way.
[2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:09.760]  That's exactly right.
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:12.320]  And I think Kushner and I think Bannon
[2:46:12.320 --> 2:46:13.680]  have done a brilliant job,
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:15.360]  and Ms. Conway as well,
[2:46:15.360 --> 2:46:18.240]  of steering him right to the right direction.
[2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:21.360]  And now the American public has to understand,
[2:46:21.360 --> 2:46:23.480]  this is not about a person,
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:27.280]  this is not about a personality as much as it is,
[2:46:27.280 --> 2:46:29.480]  about a dynamic that exactly-
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:30.600]  Exactly, he's a figurehead.
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:32.600]  It's the old establishment, we know they're bad.
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:34.280]  Doesn't matter what they throw at Trump now,
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:35.560]  he's our figurehead.
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:36.520]  That's correct.
[2:46:36.520 --> 2:46:39.360]  He is the articulation of what you and I
[2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:41.200]  and many of others have said,
[2:46:41.200 --> 2:46:43.360]  we are tired, we're sick of it,
[2:46:43.360 --> 2:46:46.760]  we no longer wanna follow what this country
[2:46:46.760 --> 2:46:48.480]  has been doing and what the leaders,
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:52.800]  you have Obama, CIA, a bred infant,
[2:46:52.800 --> 2:46:55.360]  Clinton, another CIA bred infant,
[2:46:56.480 --> 2:46:59.640]  Bush Jr., a disaster, another CIA.
[2:46:59.640 --> 2:47:01.800]  This is the end of the CIA
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:05.960]  and its capability to insert into our presidency
[2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:09.240]  the people that they've nurtured and created.
[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:11.960]  In turn, we have Michael Flynn
[2:47:11.960 --> 2:47:14.600]  of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:16.200]  and she has on the other hand,
[2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:19.120]  somebody not as capable, Michael Hayden.
[2:47:19.120 --> 2:47:21.240]  But now we have a confrontation
[2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:23.040]  between the civilian intelligence
[2:47:23.040 --> 2:47:24.760]  and the military intelligence,
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:26.960]  which is what I've said for a long time.
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:30.200]  It's time that our military intelligence took over,
[2:47:30.200 --> 2:47:33.840]  did not follow the precepts of an incompetent
[2:47:33.840 --> 2:47:36.440]  Catholics in action or CIA
[2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:40.560]  and just put our country into a steady stream
[2:47:40.560 --> 2:47:41.600]  of effectiveness.
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:44.040]  I still go back to General Eisenhower.
[2:47:44.040 --> 2:47:47.440]  It was Eisenhower who, as a general said,
[2:47:47.440 --> 2:47:50.400]  beware of the military industrial complex.
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:54.280]  It was Eisenhower who went to Korea and stopped a war
[2:47:54.280 --> 2:47:56.360]  that Truman, a Democrat, created.
[2:47:56.360 --> 2:47:59.560]  It was Eisenhower who warned of a potential war.
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:01.600]  And who tried to fix race relations
[2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:04.480]  which the Democrats then seized on and weaponized.
[2:48:04.480 --> 2:48:05.320]  Correct.
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:08.000]  Now the fact that Hillary's using Putin
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  as a false emblem of nastiness
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:16.640]  and bitterness is the fact that she is in that.
[2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:19.040]  She has always been in that, the Secretary of State.
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:20.400]  I agree, but let's go back to Eisenhower
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:23.520]  because it seems like everything good came out of him
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:24.680]  and we saw shadows of it.
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:28.360]  Like he stabilized Iraq, Egypt, put in groups
[2:48:28.360 --> 2:48:31.240]  that were secular, and then the CIA changes its policy
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:33.240]  and overthrows those to put jihadis in
[2:48:33.240 --> 2:48:34.400]  to destabilize it all.
[2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:35.560]  I guess they have some place to bomb.
[2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:36.400]  Is that correct?
[2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:38.240]  That is absolutely correct.
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:42.760]  Eisenhower warned America of the CIA's
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:44.760]  detrimental force to our country.
[2:48:44.760 --> 2:48:49.720]  He warned Alan Dulles and he reprimanded him
[2:48:49.720 --> 2:48:51.000]  and the other individuals
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:53.320]  because he had General Biddle Smith
[2:48:53.320 --> 2:48:56.280]  and he had created his own psychological operations
[2:48:56.280 --> 2:49:00.160]  within the White House which he kept away from the CIA.
[2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:03.240]  He didn't like the work, he didn't like who they were.
[2:49:03.240 --> 2:49:06.560]  He himself was exactly what America was.
[2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:10.520]  Midwestern, modest, not grandiose,
[2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:12.840]  in no way was he interested in money.
[2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:15.440]  He was 59 years old when he was a colonel
[2:49:15.440 --> 2:49:18.040]  under Douglas MacArthur, one of the biggest pains
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:21.240]  in the ass that we've ever had as a general
[2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:25.160]  and he effectively led a war in Europe.
[2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:27.080]  He then returned to become president
[2:49:27.080 --> 2:49:30.520]  of Columbia University, not the head of a company,
[2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:32.840]  not the head of some corporation,
[2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:36.120]  didn't take money at $600,000 a shot
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:38.240]  the way Hillary did or bill
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:41.600]  and went on to become president of the United States.
[2:49:41.600 --> 2:49:43.800]  He had Nixon, Nixon had shortfalls
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:45.880]  but having worked with him, I've got to tell you,
[2:49:45.880 --> 2:49:47.640]  he was a brilliant man
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:50.200]  and considering they call him Tricky Dick,
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:52.120]  in comparison to Hillary,
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:54.040]  he was only missing 18 minutes
[2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:56.600]  versus Hillary's 32,000 email.
[2:49:56.600 --> 2:49:57.800]  That's right, all right.
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:49:58.760]  I'm gonna come back and take a few calls
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:50:00.200]  in two final silvers, you can write a shock on this.
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:01.840]  I appreciate you being here, Dr. Buchanan
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:03.240]  and the day of the night's taken over.
[2:50:03.240 --> 2:50:05.480]  I wanna know these calls but we're about to go to break.
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:06.920]  Let me just ask you this quick.
[2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:08.600]  They're gonna strike back though
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:11.040]  and they run these hoaxes that he's gotta step down.
[2:50:11.040 --> 2:50:13.000]  How do we get the public not to buy into that?
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.800]  Because they avoid it and just continuously support them
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:20.120]  and listen to you and work on what we need to do for ourselves.
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:22.040]  But you're really confident we're gonna be able to beat them?
[2:50:22.040 --> 2:50:23.120]  I mean, I know he's gonna win
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:23.960]  but they're gonna try to steal.
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:24.800]  We can beat them.
[2:50:24.800 --> 2:50:26.680]  The next 30 days is very important
[2:50:26.680 --> 2:50:29.800]  because remember, 30 days in 21st century
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:31.760]  is an accelerated period of time.
[2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:34.400]  I want the people to go out to vote,
[2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:37.280]  to watch the electoral booth
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:39.880]  and to keep on supporting him.
[2:50:39.880 --> 2:50:41.160]  She is finished.
[2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:44.840]  She's physically and mentally not capable of traveling,
[2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:45.880]  not capable of anything.
[2:50:45.880 --> 2:50:47.080]  No, I understand, I understand
[2:50:47.080 --> 2:50:48.080]  but the elite are so arrogant
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:49.320]  they're gonna try to just steal it and put her in there.
[2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:50.760]  What happens if they try to steal it?
[2:50:50.760 --> 2:50:51.640]  When we come back?
[2:50:51.640 --> 2:50:53.040]  I mean, Trump's gonna fight it obviously
[2:50:53.040 --> 2:50:55.880]  but seeing it has openly fake polls
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:50:58.000]  where they have almost double sampling for Democrats.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:50:59.640]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[2:51:00.600 --> 2:51:01.840]  What would your life be like
[2:51:01.840 --> 2:51:04.400]  if you woke up each morning with new vitality,
[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:06.160]  feeling better than you have in years
[2:51:06.160 --> 2:51:08.320]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,
[2:51:08.320 --> 2:51:09.360]  blood sugar levels
[2:51:09.360 --> 2:51:11.480]  and had a sense of wellbeing overall?
[2:51:11.480 --> 2:51:13.400]  There's something that is changing thousands
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:15.600]  of people's lives and you could be one of them.
[2:51:15.600 --> 2:51:17.720]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:20.600]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract
[2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:23.400]  talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[2:51:23.400 --> 2:51:26.080]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract
[2:51:26.080 --> 2:51:28.520]  is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins,
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:31.560]  minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients
[2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:33.320]  so the body will heal itself.
[2:51:33.320 --> 2:51:35.320]  And yes, the body does have the ability
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:37.960]  to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[2:51:37.960 --> 2:51:39.800]  clean and unclog the arteries.
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:43.120]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:45.160]  so the body is an amazing thing.
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:46.600]  It simply needs some help
[2:51:46.600 --> 2:51:48.400]  so it has the tools to heal itself.
[2:51:48.400 --> 2:51:50.840]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.640]  Today, I became a biophoton woman.
[2:52:02.640 --> 2:52:05.400]  I put a tablespoon of the Andreas five seed oil
[2:52:05.400 --> 2:52:07.560]  in my morning one-world-way drink
[2:52:07.560 --> 2:52:10.240]  and was still happy and energized at 3 p.m.
[2:52:10.240 --> 2:52:13.000]  Normally I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:15.680]  but today I felt energy and very clear.
[2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:18.040]  My friend at the farmers market asked what I was on.
[2:52:18.040 --> 2:52:19.600]  She said my eyes look bright
[2:52:19.600 --> 2:52:22.480]  and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon.
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:24.320]  I told her there was a magical oil
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:26.840]  that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy
[2:52:26.840 --> 2:52:28.040]  as if I were a plant.
[2:52:28.040 --> 2:52:29.720]  She said, I want some.
[2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:32.280]  The second one-world-way shake with the oil
[2:52:32.280 --> 2:52:34.080]  when I got home took me to bedtime
[2:52:34.080 --> 2:52:36.560]  with that wonderful, abundant energy.
[2:52:36.560 --> 2:52:38.560]  I couldn't believe how much I got done
[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:39.880]  and how great I felt.
[2:52:39.880 --> 2:52:42.520]  The combination of one-world-way and five seed oil
[2:52:42.520 --> 2:52:45.520]  produced a significant health event in my life,
[2:52:45.520 --> 2:52:47.080]  the kind that makes you feel these things,
[2:52:47.080 --> 2:52:50.520]  giving your life back with a bonus and I'm 64.
[2:52:50.520 --> 2:52:53.880]  Five seed oil in one-world-way for your fantastic health.

[2:52:59.680 --> 2:53:01.120]  Empower your health and wealth
[2:53:01.120 --> 2:53:03.360]  while supporting the shows you love on GCN.
[2:53:03.360 --> 2:53:04.600]  I'm doing just that.
[2:53:04.600 --> 2:53:06.080]  G'day, I'm Jamele Bookaboo.
[2:53:06.080 --> 2:53:07.680]  I heard Dr. Wallach on GCN.
[2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:09.920]  Now my wife and I support our five children
[2:53:09.920 --> 2:53:11.680]  and do what we love with young Jevity.
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:13.400]  For information on how you can do the same
[2:53:13.400 --> 2:53:16.080]  and get free training, go to teamg'day.com.
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:19.480]  That T-E-A-M-G-D-A-Y.com.
[2:53:19.480 --> 2:53:23.000]  Call me now on 808-436-5025.
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:23.840]  That's me, Jamele.
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:27.600]  Call me now 808-436-5025.
[2:53:27.600 --> 2:53:29.320]  Aloha!
[2:53:29.320 --> 2:53:30.560]  In these uncertain times,
[2:53:30.560 --> 2:53:32.720]  it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method
[2:53:32.720 --> 2:53:34.120]  to cook food and boil water.
[2:53:34.120 --> 2:53:36.920]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove
[2:53:36.920 --> 2:53:38.520]  or cooking over an open fire,
[2:53:38.520 --> 2:53:40.040]  then there's a much better way.
[2:53:40.040 --> 2:53:41.320]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove
[2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:43.280]  is a biomass-burning cooking stove
[2:53:43.280 --> 2:53:45.520]  that only requires small quantities of sticks
[2:53:45.520 --> 2:53:46.520]  and twigs for fuel.
[2:53:46.520 --> 2:53:48.400]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use,
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:50.600]  smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable.
[2:53:50.600 --> 2:53:52.640]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves
[2:53:52.640 --> 2:53:55.160]  and fire starters made right here in the USA,
[2:53:55.160 --> 2:53:56.840]  go to minutemanstove.com.
[2:53:56.840 --> 2:53:58.920]  That's minutemanstove.com.
[2:54:00.360 --> 2:54:07.040]  All right, Don and Mike, I'm going to you.
[2:54:07.040 --> 2:54:08.760]  Dr. Steve Pachennick of StevePachennick.com
[2:54:08.760 --> 2:54:10.080]  is our guest.
[2:54:10.080 --> 2:54:11.360]  And let's put his Twitter up on the screens
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:12.400]  and plug that too.
[2:54:12.400 --> 2:54:14.000]  I'm on ShowsThemFullWars.com.
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:15.760]  This is a huge town to be alive.
[2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:16.960]  This is real.
[2:54:16.960 --> 2:54:18.320]  I'm not been excited about other elections
[2:54:18.320 --> 2:54:20.240]  because it's just two wings on the same bird.
[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:21.360]  This is different.
[2:54:21.360 --> 2:54:23.680]  It's seismic, it's global, it's important.
[2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:25.520]  We need new management.
[2:54:25.520 --> 2:54:28.320]  This isn't even about parties or anything.
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:30.520]  This is about a corrupt elite disconnected
[2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:31.600]  smoking their own dope.
[2:54:31.600 --> 2:54:33.840]  But briefly in 30 seconds, Dr. Pachennick,
[2:54:33.840 --> 2:54:35.200]  I understand you're putting a good face on.
[2:54:35.200 --> 2:54:36.040]  I agree.
[2:54:36.040 --> 2:54:37.000]  We're in very positive waters.
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:38.800]  The general public needs confidence.
[2:54:38.800 --> 2:54:40.960]  They get roped into these stampede like lemmings.
[2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:44.240]  But for our listeners who you know
[2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:47.320]  aren't your average duck, they understand what's going on.
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:49.920]  I mean, I really want to know from your perspective
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:51.240]  how you think they're going to strike back.
[2:54:51.240 --> 2:54:53.920]  I mean, I get the fact trying to run this sick crazy woman
[2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:55.480]  just shows they shouldn't be in office.
[2:54:55.480 --> 2:54:58.000]  But at the same time, they're still gonna try this.
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:54:59.520]  They're still gonna run this thing.
[2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:00.560]  They're still gonna try to steal it.
[2:55:00.560 --> 2:55:02.080]  So what do we do?
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:04.080]  Well, what we do is number one,
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:07.280]  I would love to see the honorable men and women
[2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:10.920]  of the FBI who've been compromised by corrupt boss,
[2:55:10.920 --> 2:55:13.920]  James Comey, to come out on their own
[2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:16.880]  and basically state that they no longer believe
[2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:18.360]  in their leader and that he's not.
[2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:20.240]  Imagine a press conference if a hundred of them
[2:55:20.240 --> 2:55:22.360]  stood together, you couldn't fire them all, it'd be over.
[2:55:22.360 --> 2:55:23.600]  Well, that's my point.
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:26.640]  And it's time for the American citizen
[2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:28.720]  who works for the CIA for the-
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:30.600]  Exactly, why do you and I have to be the ones
[2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:31.600]  hanging our ass out here?
[2:55:31.600 --> 2:55:32.840]  And I'm not bragging that we're heroes,
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:35.520]  but where is that survival instinct?
[2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:37.320]  You and I, it's very simple.
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:39.200]  You and I don't have a pension.
[2:55:39.200 --> 2:55:41.640]  We're not guaranteed our livelihood.
[2:55:41.640 --> 2:55:44.840]  You and I know that we have to hustle every day
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:45.880]  for our living.
[2:55:45.880 --> 2:55:48.440]  We don't have a guaranteed life cycle,
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:52.120]  but the FBI individual thinks that he or she
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:55.560]  is going to be given, gonna be taken care of
[2:55:55.560 --> 2:55:57.440]  for their whole life, get a pension.
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:55:58.280]  It's just not gonna happen.
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:00.440]  But you said it, they are discrediting it
[2:56:00.440 --> 2:56:01.760]  with a mortal wound.
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:03.240]  They can't put this back together again
[2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:04.560]  unless they turn against it.
[2:56:04.560 --> 2:56:07.720]  Well, they have to, there's no other alternative.
[2:56:07.720 --> 2:56:11.040]  And I know many of the FBI career officers
[2:56:11.040 --> 2:56:12.400]  and they have to remember,
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:15.120]  James Comey was never an FBI agent.
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:17.400]  He was never a special agent.
[2:56:17.400 --> 2:56:19.320]  He's a political prosecutor.
[2:56:19.320 --> 2:56:20.480]  And he was a lawyer.
[2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:22.480]  And he was a compromised lawyer,
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:25.920]  with along with Sandy Berger and Cheryl Mills
[2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:27.760]  and all the other.
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:29.120]  But you're right, the next 28 days,
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:31.000]  we need people now to do the right things, folks.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:31.840]  That's correct.
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:34.480]  The first thing I would say, I'd like the FBI people
[2:56:34.480 --> 2:56:38.360]  to walk out and say, look, we no longer can support Comey.
[2:56:38.360 --> 2:56:41.000]  There are those in the CIA who can say the same thing
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:42.480]  about John Brennan.
[2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:45.320]  There are those in the military who could say, look,
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:47.640]  we're standing up for what we believe in,
[2:56:47.640 --> 2:56:49.640]  but they can defy orders.
[2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:53.200]  If the orders and the people are incompetent or corrupt,
[2:56:53.200 --> 2:56:56.280]  there is an obligation in the Constitution
[2:56:56.280 --> 2:56:57.600]  for us to fight the men.
[2:56:57.600 --> 2:56:58.760]  And so the Declaration of Independence,
[2:56:58.760 --> 2:56:59.840]  you're right, Don in Texas,
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:02.600]  you're on the air with Dr. Steve Petrenik, go ahead.
[2:57:02.600 --> 2:57:04.080]  Hey, Alex, it's finally,
[2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:05.880]  it's good to finally be able to talk to you.
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:09.120]  Hey, you termed Hillary the walking corpse.
[2:57:09.120 --> 2:57:13.560]  In fact, well, I saw that fly clawed all over her face.
[2:57:13.560 --> 2:57:16.800]  The first thing that came to mind was rotting demon flesh.
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:17.640]  I mean, I've been saying,
[2:57:17.640 --> 2:57:19.080]  she's like a reanimated corpse for a while.
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:20.480]  I don't know what drugs they got her on.
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:21.920]  That's a good question for Petrenik.
[2:57:21.920 --> 2:57:24.240]  How could she be not able to even be in public for a while
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:25.720]  and do okay at these debates?
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:28.560]  She has to rest for weeks and weeks as a physician.
[2:57:28.560 --> 2:57:29.400]  What are they doing?
[2:57:29.400 --> 2:57:31.920]  There's another issue that you brought out a long time ago.
[2:57:31.920 --> 2:57:35.120]  And I think that she may be receiving blood transfusions,
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:37.280]  which has been known in the past
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:40.040]  to revive certain people for a certain amount of time.
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:42.680]  But if you looked at her at the end of the debate,
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:43.920]  she was very tired.
[2:57:43.920 --> 2:57:45.400]  She was having to sit down.
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:47.200]  There was a few minutes when we've got clips coming up
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:48.440]  where she kind of blocks out.
[2:57:48.440 --> 2:57:49.280]  Correct.
[2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:52.480]  And then that CIA operative who's their lawyer,
[2:57:52.480 --> 2:57:54.440]  so to speak, but he worked in Africa
[2:57:54.440 --> 2:57:58.600]  and elsewhere comes in and picks out her notes.
[2:57:58.600 --> 2:58:00.320]  It's the same guy you see all the time.
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:01.160]  Absolutely.
[2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:02.000]  Great point, Dr. Petrenik.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:02.840]  Don, go ahead.
[2:58:02.840 --> 2:58:03.680]  Anything else?
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:05.280]  Yeah, it's like she's a pile of dead flesh.
[2:58:05.280 --> 2:58:06.840]  In that post-debate interview,
[2:58:06.840 --> 2:58:08.480]  she looked like she had about had it.
[2:58:08.480 --> 2:58:10.800]  Her eyes were bugged out and going in different directions.
[2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:14.760]  And I mean, she, I think she reached a limit of her drugs.
[2:58:14.760 --> 2:58:15.600]  Yeah.
[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:16.600]  It just shows the hubris.
[2:58:16.600 --> 2:58:17.960]  Why didn't they get a better candidate?
[2:58:17.960 --> 2:58:19.360]  Because it's her turn.
[2:58:19.360 --> 2:58:21.080]  It's her turn, Dr. Petrenik, isn't it?
[2:58:21.080 --> 2:58:22.360]  So we have to run a corpse.
[2:58:22.360 --> 2:58:24.960]  Well, the point is that she's so ruthless
[2:58:24.960 --> 2:58:26.840]  and the machinery is so corrupt
[2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:29.840]  that they've compromised everybody in the government,
[2:58:29.840 --> 2:58:32.280]  including Colmy, Loretta Land.
[2:58:32.280 --> 2:58:33.400]  Yeah, they're their own worst enemy.
[2:58:33.400 --> 2:58:34.240]  They don't get it.
[2:58:34.240 --> 2:58:35.160]  I mean, at the end of the day,
[2:58:35.160 --> 2:58:36.400]  they're the ones bringing them down.
[2:58:36.400 --> 2:58:37.960]  We just want to stop nuclear war.
[2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:38.800]  Thank you, Don.
[2:58:38.800 --> 2:58:40.800]  Thank you, Dr. Petrenik, and others who call 70 Seconds
[2:58:40.800 --> 2:58:41.640]  with Dr. Petrenik.
[2:58:41.640 --> 2:58:43.360]  Then we've got David Dike coming in.
[2:58:43.360 --> 2:58:44.200]  Get ready.
[2:58:44.200 --> 2:58:46.960]  Again, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[2:58:49.960 --> 2:58:51.880]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[2:58:51.880 --> 2:58:53.840]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[2:58:53.840 --> 2:58:56.800]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[2:58:56.800 --> 2:58:59.680]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:02.880]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[2:59:02.880 --> 2:59:05.240]  The same team based right here in America
[2:59:05.240 --> 2:59:08.240]  that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water
[2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:12.080]  filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:13.440]  Whether it's your home or office,
[2:59:13.440 --> 2:59:16.320]  you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family,
[2:59:16.320 --> 2:59:19.640]  your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[2:59:19.640 --> 2:59:22.320]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[2:59:22.320 --> 2:59:24.760]  while themselves doing things that mitigate
[2:59:24.760 --> 2:59:27.680]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[2:59:27.680 --> 2:59:29.840]  The general public doesn't.
[2:59:29.840 --> 2:59:33.720]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:59:33.720 --> 2:59:36.400]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:37.320]  incredibly clean.
[2:59:37.320 --> 2:59:39.080]  This is a system I'm personally putting in
[2:59:39.080 --> 2:59:42.000]  throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:44.000]  that didn't do as good a job.
[2:59:44.000 --> 2:59:47.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today,
[2:59:47.000 --> 2:59:48.400]  and then fullwarstore.com.
[2:59:52.520 --> 2:59:55.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:59:55.520 --> 3:00:06.520]  The world, the world is a dangerous place, not because of evil,
[3:00:06.520 --> 3:00:10.520]  but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[3:00:10.520 --> 3:00:13.520]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:15.520]  you are the resistance.
[3:00:15.520 --> 3:00:17.520]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil,
[3:00:17.520 --> 3:00:21.520]  but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[3:00:21.520 --> 3:00:25.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:25.520 --> 3:00:29.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:31.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:36.520 --> 3:00:38.520]  This is biblical. This is historical.
[3:00:38.520 --> 3:00:43.520]  This is stuff of legends you're seeing right now.
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:45.520]  We've never had greater opportunities.
[3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:46.520]  We've never been in greater peril.
[3:00:46.520 --> 3:00:49.520]  The best of times, the worst of times is the tale of two cities.
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:52.520]  And it's you that will dictate the future.
[3:00:52.520 --> 3:00:54.520]  The individual.
[3:00:57.520 --> 3:00:59.520]  Let's go ahead and take a few more phone calls.
[3:00:59.520 --> 3:01:01.520]  I'm going to play a special clip that's slowed down
[3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:04.520]  of Quentin, looking like a crazy person.
[3:01:04.520 --> 3:01:06.520]  He is a crazy, old, creepy man, but this image,
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:07.520]  we're going to put it out everywhere.
[3:01:07.520 --> 3:01:09.520]  It's going to be very powerful against the enemy.
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:10.520]  So get ready.
[3:01:10.520 --> 3:01:12.520]  infowarstore.com is the coordinates.
[3:01:12.520 --> 3:01:13.520]  It'll be up in the next few hours.
[3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:16.520]  You'll see it first here of your TV viewer in a few minutes.
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:19.520]  Right now, Dr. Buchanis are guessing a few calls.
[3:01:19.520 --> 3:01:21.520]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[3:01:21.520 --> 3:01:23.520]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:26.520]  Yeah, hi, Alex. I appreciate all you're doing for the Republic.
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:29.520]  Have you ever read George Washington's vision?
[3:01:29.520 --> 3:01:31.520]  Yes, I have.
[3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:32.520]  Please don't thank me, though.
[3:01:32.520 --> 3:01:34.520]  I'm bailing water. We're in the same boat, brother.
[3:01:34.520 --> 3:01:35.520]  I just keep explaining.
[3:01:35.520 --> 3:01:37.520]  The reason they don't thank me is this is survival.
[3:01:37.520 --> 3:01:39.520]  So thank you for being, being awake.
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:41.520]  I'll say that, but that's why they don't thank me.
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:44.520]  We're in a survival war here.
[3:01:44.520 --> 3:01:45.520]  I know.
[3:01:45.520 --> 3:01:49.520]  I don't want to be in North Korea run by crazy Hillary with a big rubber head.
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:52.520]  Yeah, you know, the last vision, though, it's, you know,
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:54.520]  the whole world comes against the United States.
[3:01:54.520 --> 3:01:57.520]  It means we don't go along with the globalist, you know, that.
[3:01:57.520 --> 3:02:01.520]  So I think that means Trump's going to get in there because we're not going along with.
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:02.520]  No, I agree.
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:08.520]  The world's destiny, as the prophet said, stands and will fall or stand with the United States.
[3:02:08.520 --> 3:02:09.520]  I think the specifics of the call.
[3:02:09.520 --> 3:02:10.520]  I looked it up.
[3:02:10.520 --> 3:02:14.520]  It was from Bismarck that what God loves, you know,
[3:02:14.520 --> 3:02:17.520]  the Bronx children in the United States of America.
[3:02:17.520 --> 3:02:19.520]  That's correct.
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:20.520]  We will survive.
[3:02:20.520 --> 3:02:26.520]  I mean, we are so unique in the, in the world that we have an ability to change very quickly
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:32.520]  and ability to change our leadership and still continue as an effective republic.
[3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:36.520]  No other country can do that.
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:37.520]  Why are they so obsessed?
[3:02:37.520 --> 3:02:39.520]  I mean, I know you helped bring down the Soviet Union.
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:40.520]  They've got their own problems.
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:44.520]  But Russia seems much less problem than China.
[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:45.520]  Why is there an obsession with Russia?
[3:02:45.520 --> 3:02:49.520]  Is that because the neocons, the roots of that got kicked out of Russia?
[3:02:49.520 --> 3:02:50.520]  Yes.
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:55.520]  I mean, the neocons who really had, have never accomplished anything except destroy their
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:02:56.520]  own country.
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:03:02.520]  They've never created a treaty like Jimmy Carter at Camp David accord and Bush senior.
[3:03:02.520 --> 3:03:04.520]  We had a Cambodia peace conference.
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:06.520]  They have accomplished nothing.
[3:03:06.520 --> 3:03:11.520]  It's a Victoria Hewland and her husband and a bunch of the Jewish neocons and others have
[3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:16.520]  thought that they could have put Israel in the middle of the map and make it a dominant
[3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:17.520]  power.
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:18.520]  That's not going to happen.
[3:03:18.520 --> 3:03:22.520]  Israel has been, will continue to be a strategic liability for the United States.
[3:03:22.520 --> 3:03:28.520]  We will support it to the extent we can, but our major concerns are in East Asia and
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:31.520]  Southeast Asia and now Indian Pakistan are fighting.
[3:03:31.520 --> 3:03:32.520]  So we have much.
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:33.520]  Oh yeah.
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:34.520]  That's flaring up.
[3:03:34.520 --> 3:03:35.520]  Is that a big concern?
[3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:40.520]  That is a major, major concern because that's two nuclear countries that are really.
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:41.520]  Let me ask you this.
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:44.520]  You knew five more minutes the next hour and finished your calls, but let me start asking
[3:03:44.520 --> 3:03:45.520]  the question now.
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:50.520]  Why is it historically that geopolitically everything heats up at once lines up because
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:54.520]  it's like, I know it's all connected, but it almost just seems like it's a cycle and
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:57.520]  we just do it because all over the world, all hell's breaking loose.
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:03:58.520]  Well, why?
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:00.520]  Well, I think he hit it on the head.
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:04.520]  We are interconnected, but we're not interconnected as people thought.
[3:04:04.520 --> 3:04:10.520]  We're interconnected because the vacuum of powers cuts right across the world when we
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:13.520]  are no longer have an effective leadership like Obama.
[3:04:13.520 --> 3:04:14.520]  Let's face it.
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:19.520]  The United States has been dominant in the brain and when our brain dies, the world dies.
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:21.520]  Well, we haven't been effective.
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:27.520]  I mean, under Condoleezza Rice, we had a disastrous foreign policy under Hillary Clinton.
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:31.520]  We had a disastrous foreign policy under Obama.
[3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:35.520]  We had done nothing but apologize for things that I don't even understand.
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:37.520]  You don't go to Laos and say, we're sorry.
[3:04:37.520 --> 3:04:43.520]  What you do is you continue to develop your own capabilities, but we don't have a leader
[3:04:43.520 --> 3:04:45.520]  who sees us this week all this ass-kissing.
[3:04:45.520 --> 3:04:47.520]  I mean, that's one on one.
[3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:49.520]  Let's come back and talk about that with Dr. Pachining.
[3:04:49.520 --> 3:04:52.520]  Straight ahead, finish a few more calls and hand the baton to David Knight.
[3:04:52.520 --> 3:05:04.520]  The show's info wars dot com with fewer than 30 days to go before the US presidential election.
[3:05:04.520 --> 3:05:08.520]  The revolution underway in America mirrors the referendum that happened a few months ago
[3:05:08.520 --> 3:05:10.520]  in Great Britain led by Nigel Farage.
[3:05:10.520 --> 3:05:17.520]  This referendum led by Donald Trump is a war waged against Wall Street, the globalist and the political elites in this country.
[3:05:17.520 --> 3:05:22.520]  Farage recently weighed in on Trump's saying that his remarks that stirred up such a fuss this week
[3:05:22.520 --> 3:05:27.520]  were nothing more than alpha male boasting and pointed out that his American counterpart isn't running to be Pope.
[3:05:27.520 --> 3:05:32.520]  Americans need a leader, a fighter, one that stands up like Trump did last night
[3:05:32.520 --> 3:05:35.520]  and historically took off the gloves when attacking Clinton.
[3:05:35.520 --> 3:05:38.520]  The one line that will go down in history from last night's debate,
[3:05:38.520 --> 3:05:43.520]  Trump called out Clinton on her law-breaking and said that if he were president, she'd be in jail.
[3:05:43.520 --> 3:05:48.520]  America's Brexit is in full force and it's up to the American people to exercise the same strength
[3:05:48.520 --> 3:05:53.520]  our British counterparts did and no longer act as puppets for the globalist agenda.
[3:05:53.520 --> 3:05:59.520]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for info wars dot com.
[3:05:59.520 --> 3:06:05.520]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[3:06:05.520 --> 3:06:09.520]  about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[3:06:09.520 --> 3:06:14.520]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[3:06:14.520 --> 3:06:20.520]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[3:06:20.520 --> 3:06:24.520]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[3:06:24.520 --> 3:06:26.520]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[3:06:26.520 --> 3:06:30.520]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[3:06:30.520 --> 3:06:33.520]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[3:06:33.520 --> 3:06:38.520]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.

[3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:32.520]  That's what binds us together no matter where we're from or what color we are. We love the true diversity of competition. We love free association.
[3:08:32.520 --> 3:08:43.520]  We love private property and family and freedom of religion. To not practice it or to practice it, we just believe in freedom and a bunch of weirdos telling us how to talk and how to live.
[3:08:43.520 --> 3:08:54.520]  It's a bunch of spoiled, rotten, crazy academia and media people and social engineers who just are so delusional and never lived in the real world, they think this dog's hunting.
[3:08:54.520 --> 3:09:01.520]  All they've done is created a bunch of mental midgets that are their minions, but those are the people that were susceptible to it.
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:06.520]  They've just created a giant group of people that absolutely hate their guts and are building alternate economies right now.
[3:09:06.520 --> 3:09:12.520]  And they hate every other system they can't control. Russia, you name it. It's a very, very dangerous situation.
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:17.520]  We'll take a few final calls from Dr. Pechenik here and then play the special clip and he leaves and go to David Knight.
[3:09:17.520 --> 3:09:28.520]  Going back to Dr. Pechenik, I was asking the question before the break about, I mean, while you heard the question, where do you think this is all going?
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:32.520]  Well, I think this is going towards a very positive outcome.
[3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:37.520]  Number one, it's going to get rid of the Republican Party as it is and should not be.
[3:09:37.520 --> 3:09:47.520]  Number two, it's going to focus in on the corruption of the White House, on the Clinton Foundation, on the people who are involved with the Clinton Democratic Party.
[3:09:47.520 --> 3:09:54.520]  And it's breaking up the entire system in a way that we don't have to go into violence. We don't have to go into chaos.
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:10:03.520]  And I find it a very constructive revolution, which is Trump Revolution. And I think it's being led by very responsible people.
[3:10:03.520 --> 3:10:09.520]  Which I should add, I've got to admire people who created the Internet in the 60s and 70s knowing they were giving it to the government.
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:19.520]  It's a spy system that would actually be a two-way time bomb, knowing, as I'm now researching deeply, that they knew that the elites would take it for one reason and it was actually something completely different.
[3:10:19.520 --> 3:10:30.520]  And the foresight that, yes, we were going to this decadent cycle, but despite that, putting it into information war would have us be the most advanced country in the world to defeat other corrupt nations,
[3:10:30.520 --> 3:10:34.520]  but also defeat our own elite. Talk about some geniuses back then.
[3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:47.520]  Well, let me be very specific. In 1973 at MIT when I was getting my PhD in political science, one of the things that I was trained by the DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Project Agency,
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:52.520]  and other intelligence groups in 1973 was the Internet and social media.
[3:10:52.520 --> 3:10:55.520]  And by the way, my dad was in that too. It's pretty amazing.
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:11:02.520]  But the Internet and social media, so forget Zuckerberg, forget Gates and all that nonsense in Silicon Valley.
[3:11:02.520 --> 3:11:17.520]  This was already developed by DARPA. This was already developed by intelligence agencies, and they were using it at that time and understood that it would be a major force in terms of taking down regimes and changing our own regime.
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:25.520]  And they understood that because I was already trained by Ithiel de Sola, Pollution Pai, and others with respect to regime change.
[3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:28.520]  And that was one of the things that we used later on.
[3:11:28.520 --> 3:11:38.520]  So the geniuses in America are really incredible, and there are those who speak against us like Gates, and there are those who speak with us like Paul Field.
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:50.520]  Let me ask this question. How could guys in the 50s, 70s envision this whole future world, build it, release it, and it's done so well? I mean, are there still people coming up like that because it's amazing?
[3:11:50.520 --> 3:12:02.520]  In some ways, yes, in some way, no. But the basic premise, if you have to remember one thing, is the fact that we had a lot of science fiction writers, Rod and Barry, Asimov,
[3:12:02.520 --> 3:12:14.520]  who predicted that this would occur in my own books on the Clancy franchise. I started to write 20 years ago about cyber nation, cyber control, cyber terrorism, and nobody understood that.
[3:12:14.520 --> 3:12:19.520]  Sure, you've been a total visionary in expanding technical and asimov. He predicted in the 40s, not just the whole robot system.
[3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:23.520]  He predicted the future, computers predicting the future, which is now here.
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:28.520]  Correct. And that's the genius that we do have in the United States.
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:41.520]  If you leave us alone and let us do what we do best and don't co-opt us with money or with the politics, and basically we can do very well and we will continue to do well. We do have that capability.
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:44.520]  Why is America so special? Because it truly is diverse.
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:57.520]  Well, it's not only diverse, but we have really more freedom than anybody realizes. We don't total our people and we allow everybody to come to their fullest potential, despite what is said.
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:13:07.520]  And that's why it's a purposeful, politically correct attack to go after our real diversity and not coddling and claim that coddling is freedom to create a stagnant system. It's a huge crime.
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:21.520]  Well, it is. I mean, I call it the fascism of the left. I mean, when Hillary Clinton says to gather together and she repeats lies and attacks Alex Jones and me and attacks us for Sandy Hook, which we knew was a false flag.
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:34.520]  And even the fact that 9-11 was an inside job, she's just repeating what Herman Gehring and Gerbil said in Germany and Nazi. She's nothing more than a spokesperson for the fascist left.
[3:13:34.520 --> 3:13:37.520]  And there is an equal amount of fascism on the left.
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:42.520]  Sure, both. Well, I want to take a few calls and let you go as long as you're busy and I need to go to bed at night, but let me just say this.
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:50.520]  Clearly they're going to try to fill the election. I said they'd do it, now they're federalizing it. Everybody should still vote to be on record to make it a landslide.
[3:13:50.520 --> 3:13:55.520]  I think the, oh, I'm going to all the hundreds of reasons, but just a approximation.
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:14:05.520]  If they try to steal it, it's the biggest mistake they ever made. And then that way leads madness. I mean, if they're, and I know there's good people, and there used to be a person, other governments, good, blah, blah, blah.
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:13.520]  I've just learned statistically, people in government are more awake than the general public, on average, and not saying they're great people, but it's like there's innovators on average are more awake than anybody.
[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:20.520]  But it seems like governments had a front row seat of the corruption, so we shouldn't make it our enemy. They want to create a civil war with the George Soros.
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:27.520]  We want to bypass that, but they will try to steal the election. What are your final concerns about that? Or do you agree or disagree?
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:36.520]  Because I just know they're so full of humorous, so full of hutzpah, bravada, that they're going to try it. I mean, we know they are. What do they have to lose? They're going to do it.
[3:14:36.520 --> 3:14:49.520]  Well, they have everything to lose. They will try to denigrate again Trump, and they will try to denigrate you and me and others involved, and it will not work.
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:57.520]  What will happen is, basically, they're in the process of hurting themselves. They're in a spiral of self-destruction.
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:07.520]  She was in that spiral from the very beginning when she never disavowed the activities of her husband, who was a total jerk, and really was ineffectual.
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:17.520]  And that spiral of self-destruction will continue. Now she's physically and mentally incapable, so someone has to take over. It won't be Bill Clinton. It'll be Podesta.
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:32.520]  Which shows this elite is incompetent that they would put a corpse forward. I keep going back to that. This is a total indictment on the Democratic Party and the establishment, and I guess they shouldn't have a crazy old Nazi collaborator at 87 running it.
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:50.520]  Well, they put up their choice. It's not an issue anymore of Democrats versus Republicans. It's an issue very much of the American public wants a revolution that's effective, constructive, and lets us to continue to be the predominant power in the world without attacking Iraq, Syria.
[3:15:50.520 --> 3:15:54.520]  Oh, can you imagine when Trump cuts taxes by half? Oh my God.
[3:15:54.520 --> 3:16:10.520]  Well, you know, self-destructiveness is something that we can change by throwing them out, and we can't change the behavior. I mean, you see the nonsensical points that she makes. You see how the entire media is corrupted and co-opted.
[3:16:10.520 --> 3:16:25.520]  Remember, the Zookers who have to run CNN and the other cable companies have lost their audience. You have, as you said before, and I know a far bigger audience, but we fund these cable companies because of the fees we put.
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:44.520]  I'm about to say, I'm not bragging. It's surreal to know that we had 2.5 million viewers last night just off streams and it's growing. It's surreal to know we had 24,000 phone calls to try to call in. And I look at CNN's ratings. So I don't get this paradigm because I still psychologically, you're a psychiatrist, feel like CNN's bigger than me, even though they're not.
[3:16:44.520 --> 3:16:50.520]  And I don't understand it. It's kind of like you finally see your dad, he's shorter than you, but he still looks bigger than you. I don't know how to explain that.
[3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:58.520]  Well, what it is is the paradox of contention. They think that they can pull all kinds of fast tricks when, in fact, they're hurting themselves.
[3:16:58.520 --> 3:17:12.520]  Let me give you an example. The very opening of that whole debate with Francis Cup, his nonsensical statement, and then bringing out a Singaporean student to talk about democracy was absurd.
[3:17:12.520 --> 3:17:23.520]  Singapore, under Lee Kuan Yew, whom I knew and I worked with, is the most repressive society in Asia. It is effective, but it is a demagoguery.
[3:17:23.520 --> 3:17:30.520]  And to put him there as a symbol of democracy was an absurd statement.
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:42.520]  That's a joke. Isn't Singapore a British, the totalitarian test?
[3:17:42.520 --> 3:17:52.520]  Well, it was, but Singapore left and Lee Kuan Yew, who was studied at Oxford, got a PhD, initially became a communist, made it into a highly repressive...
[3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:55.520]  No, I know. They call him the Dean of the Island and everything.
[3:17:55.520 --> 3:18:05.520]  Correct. I mean, he is a highly honorable individual, but he is total repression. So to put a Singaporean student there to represent democracy is an oxymoron.
[3:18:05.520 --> 3:18:14.520]  I was about to say, but that's the problem. As soon as he goes, he's an honorable guy, runs a technocracy, and so, yeah, low crime overall, but it's a total tyranny.
[3:18:14.520 --> 3:18:20.520]  But a good tyranny, in that it was run by a good guy, as soon as he leaves, it degenerates.
[3:18:20.520 --> 3:18:31.520]  That's correct, but it shows you the stupidity of the presidential commission, the fact that neither one of the examiners, Anderson Cooper, questioned it.
[3:18:31.520 --> 3:18:39.520]  It showed you that Frank Sinop had no idea of what he was doing, and it showed you the University of Washington had no idea of what they were doing.
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:50.520]  So once again, ignorance is prevalent in our academia, in our media, and in our candidates, and Trump is learning, and he's a fast learner.
[3:18:50.520 --> 3:18:55.520]  And the minute he picks that up, he hits them, and that's what people can't tolerate.
[3:18:55.520 --> 3:19:10.520]  So they envy him because he was able to achieve a wealth at the risk of his own well-being. I mean, you don't get to build billions of dollars of net worth on the basis of somebody giving you millions.
[3:19:10.520 --> 3:19:22.520]  You can still throw that away. That's not even relevant. He never gave up, and you can see he keeps on going on flight, after flight, after flight, to town, after town, whereas Hillary can't do anything.
[3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:27.520]  She's totally incapacitated. And it shows how the media goes along with it, and they wonder why their ratings drop and drop.
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:33.520]  They don't, it's just like, it's watching Lemmings go off the edge of a cliff. Let's take a few calls on where Pachennic goes.
[3:19:33.520 --> 3:19:39.520]  I gotta go to David here. We're skipping this break. Michael Louisiana, you're on the air worldwide with Dr. Steve Pachennic.
[3:19:39.520 --> 3:19:58.520]  Yeah, listen, I don't know if you caught this, but last night when Trump was saying that Hillary and Obama won't say anything about radical Islamist terrorists, when she was during her response, she called it radical jihadist terror.
[3:19:58.520 --> 3:20:02.520]  And then right after that, she said it has nothing to do with Islam.
[3:20:02.520 --> 3:20:09.520]  I know I saw that. Meanwhile, they're saying it's bad that he tweeted she is a criminal, saying she is now sexist to say someone's a woman.
[3:20:09.520 --> 3:20:16.520]  This is total assault on language. Dr. Pachennic, what is this attack on language? I mean, obviously it's to create total mental illness.
[3:20:16.520 --> 3:20:24.520]  It's a distraction, but basically it's the beginning of trying to create thought control. You know, George Orwell warned us of it.
[3:20:24.520 --> 3:20:26.520]  Sure, reducing language then.
[3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:27.520]  I'm sorry?
[3:20:27.520 --> 3:20:29.520]  So it's 1984. It's reducing language.
[3:20:29.520 --> 3:20:39.520]  Yeah, it's reducing language to basically the ability for them to control what we say and how we say it. It's nonsensical. It's not even relevant. It's academic foolishness.
[3:20:39.520 --> 3:20:43.520]  I agree. So it shows how delusional they are. This would actually work.
[3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:53.520]  Oh, absolutely. But it gives a lot of academicians, you know, salaries and it gives the president something to say or do other than the fact he's wasting our money and time.
[3:20:53.520 --> 3:21:01.520]  Sure, but how do we sit around the boardroom and go, let's attack language and reduce it down to nothing so we destroy civilization? I mean, these people are reprobate.
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:11.520]  Well, they don't know the history of World War II. What it shows is the complete ignorance of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Obama and the neocons in terms of what happened during World War II.
[3:21:11.520 --> 3:21:25.520]  They claim they understand that these neocon Jews are as stupid as they come. And unfortunately, they came from my university Cornell, which produced Steve Hadley, Paul Wolfowitz, Sandy Bergen and Fukuyama, all morons.
[3:21:25.520 --> 3:21:36.520]  Well, I think the main prime mover, whether, you know, they be neocons or whatever they are, is they are arrogant. These people like float around in this self delusion.
[3:21:36.520 --> 3:21:46.520]  They have no job. They're not able to do what you or I or the ordinary American is able to do to go out, make a living on their own and create an asset. They've never created an asset.
[3:21:46.520 --> 3:22:00.520]  All they can do is become sick offense in Washington, D.C., get a pension from something, tank the Rand Corporation, the Brookings Institute, which is a joke run by Stroke Talbot, the man who cleaned up Bill Clinton.
[3:22:00.520 --> 3:22:06.520]  He was his cleaner and a CIA operative. I mean, these are not very bright people.
[3:22:06.520 --> 3:22:09.520]  That's right. You show that Talbot was the handler of Hillary and Bill, I guess, in England.
[3:22:09.520 --> 3:22:18.520]  Exactly. He was the one who said, oh, no, Myrna was not a problem. Bill Clinton was not a problem. He's totally complicit. All collusive agents.
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:24.520]  Well, I read, tell me this is accurate, that when they sent the Clintons into Russia, they were like some of the worst agents ever.
[3:22:24.520 --> 3:22:34.520]  Well, Bill Clinton never showed up at Oxford. He was on a Fulbright scholarship. He went in and he was supposed to monitor anti-war protests or protestors, and he was totally a disaster.
[3:22:34.520 --> 3:22:45.520]  But the agency doesn't really care whether you're effective. What they care about is that you have the profile like Bill Clinton, no father, mother was a prostitute, and you had a father figure.
[3:22:45.520 --> 3:22:57.520]  He had nothing with Obama, no father or father, Kenya, but the real issue is his mother that they never talked about. She's a CIA operative, maternal grandmother, CIA, maternal grandfather, CIA.
[3:22:57.520 --> 3:23:06.520]  He's a product of the CIA, mulatto mixture who was brought out with no accomplishment, no future, and no capability to do anything.
[3:23:06.520 --> 3:23:14.520]  So what they were interested was control. They didn't really, the CIA has no capability to think strategically or act strategically.
[3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:17.520]  They just further their own aims.
[3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:26.520]  Well, you got John Brennan, you got Doolin, you've got all kinds of pathetic individuals who really were ineffectual in intelligence.
[3:23:26.520 --> 3:23:35.520]  Eisenhower said it, a whole bunch of our generals have said it. I've said it repeatedly. I oversaw them in terms of military intelligence.
[3:23:35.520 --> 3:23:39.520]  They were pathetic, yet they co-opted our military to do so come.
[3:23:39.520 --> 3:23:45.520]  I know, I can't believe they're taking over the military. Angie in Alaska, you're on the air with Dr. Steve Picenic, go ahead.
[3:23:45.520 --> 3:23:53.520]  Yes, Dr. Picenic, I agree with you that the American people, we do want a revolution. We want a revolution against our crony government.
[3:23:53.520 --> 3:23:57.520]  We want a revolution against them putting us into wars that we don't want.
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:05.520]  We want to revolt and have jobs instead of them making us lose our jobs with the EPA and all their bureaucratic BS.
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:15.520]  Sure. And I really think that last night's debate was fantastic. I think that for anybody who's ever been a victim of sexual violence,
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:21.520]  I think that Donald Trump probably stood up for more women last night than I've ever seen anybody do.
[3:24:21.520 --> 3:24:24.520]  Well, let me tell you, I've never endorsed a candidate like this and gotten behind him.
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:28.520]  And before I did, because I don't like the casinos and stuff, I really did some snooping.
[3:24:28.520 --> 3:24:33.520]  I made some phone calls, I did some stuff, and if Trump does anything, he spoils the daylights out of women.
[3:24:33.520 --> 3:24:37.520]  So he's a rapist like I'm an Easter Bunny.
[3:24:37.520 --> 3:24:41.520]  Yeah, I thought it was phenomenal that he stood up for those women.
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:46.520]  And if anybody's even seen the videos, it's deplorable what the Clintons have done to these women.
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:53.520]  And our senators up here, they're like, this weekend they were saying, they're not going to support Donald Trump.
[3:24:53.520 --> 3:24:54.520]  He needs to stand down.
[3:24:54.520 --> 3:24:58.520]  Does that go to the arrogance? Bill Clinton is settling rape cases.
[3:24:58.520 --> 3:25:04.520]  Hillary covers up, she represents pedophiles, and they're bitching at him about some secret edited,
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:08.520]  racy tape put out by a Bush, and Jerry Falwell Jr.'s come out instead.
[3:25:08.520 --> 3:25:12.520]  He thinks the Republicans leaked it. Of course him leaving the show is fake.
[3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:16.520]  Of course Bush did this. Of course it's edited. You can hear the damn tape.
[3:25:16.520 --> 3:25:19.520]  Now, you can tell Trump's advisors said, listen, they'll never believe it's edited.
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:23.520]  Just say you're sorry. The damn thing is edited. They're asking him questions.
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:29.520]  Dr. Buchanig. I think what you said, Madam, is correct. And I think what you need to do,
[3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:39.520]  and your colleagues, and your state is to put your representatives on notice to explain to you and to everybody else,
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:46.520]  what in fact are they accomplishing? What in fact have they done other than go to meetings and talk a lot?
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:51.520]  I find, and I've treated many congressmen and senators, I find they do nothing.
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:54.520]  I find that they spend years just talking about themselves.
[3:25:54.520 --> 3:25:59.520]  They're not visionaries. The elite hire a bunch of yes men. We need visionaries again.
[3:25:59.520 --> 3:26:06.520]  Well, I'm not sure we even need congressional representatives and senators because I think what this person, you've pointed out very clearly.
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:14.520]  All they really do is basically talk and talk down to somebody, but as a constituent, I want to know what my representative does.
[3:26:14.520 --> 3:26:20.520]  And I'm not very impressed on either side, but I am impressed that it cost us a lot of money.
[3:26:20.520 --> 3:26:24.520]  Well said. Dr. Buchanig, folks really love you on the show. It's crazy. You've been on 15 years.
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:30.520]  Well, I love to be on your show and I admire what you've done. I know, Alex, you don't like it, but you have been in the forefront,
[3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:32.520]  and that is important, Alex.
[3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:33.520]  Well, I can't help it.
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:39.520]  We cannot have done this. I'm being very frank. You know, when I had Steve Quayle and then you guys,
[3:26:39.520 --> 3:26:45.520]  I mean, it's been a huge effort on behalf of a lot of people, but you've kept on going.
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:49.520]  And whatever vitamins you're taking, please keep on doing it.
[3:26:49.520 --> 3:26:52.520]  Well, God bless you, brother. We'll talk to you soon. We appreciate your work.
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:54.520]  You can bless the audience.
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:26:59.520]  Thank you. All right. I'm out of time. I got collars and cameras. I got to go. I got meetings and I got a sick family member.
[3:26:59.520 --> 3:27:04.520]  I got to go deal with it. So a lot going on. I want to go out to break with this clip.
[3:27:04.520 --> 3:27:09.520]  This is something they put together. We're going to go put this out as a viral video with just a shorter gif of it.
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:14.520]  But this is Clinton with the creepy eyes, but in slow motion, it's even worse with Trump and slow motion talking to him.
[3:27:14.520 --> 3:27:16.520]  It's epic. Let's start rolling it.
[3:27:16.520 --> 3:27:25.520]  But Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[3:27:25.520 --> 3:27:33.520]  One of the women who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old was raped at 12.
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:41.520]  Her client, she represented, got him off and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:48.520]  Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight. So don't tell me about words.
[3:27:48.520 --> 3:27:56.520]  I am absolutely, I apologize for those words, but it is things that people say.
[3:27:56.520 --> 3:28:02.520]  But what President Clinton did, he was impeached. He lost his license to practice law.
[3:28:02.520 --> 3:28:10.520]  He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:19.520]  And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that, and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago,
[3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:25.520]  I think it's disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth.
[3:28:25.520 --> 3:28:36.520]  Her client, she represented, got him off and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.
[3:28:36.520 --> 3:28:45.520]  But what President Clinton did, he was impeached. He lost his license to practice law.
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:57.520]  He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
[3:28:57.520 --> 3:29:10.520]  And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that, and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago.
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:16.520]  And again, we have it slowed down to where he turns his eyes and looks. I just want to come back with, that was the clip I wanted.
[3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:20.520]  But that is important to see. It's important to understand that.
[3:29:20.520 --> 3:29:26.520]  It's important to really just slow that down and see Bill Clinton in the crosshairs there because nobody ever stands up against these people.
[3:29:26.520 --> 3:29:31.520]  And we are doing an infowars.com. We'll come back and introduce you every night and get out of here.
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:35.520]  But this is a very big time to be alive. And one of my own today, I'm on Selenium.
[3:29:35.520 --> 3:29:38.520]  Super Mel Vitality NX2 that I put in my water this morning.
[3:29:38.520 --> 3:29:42.520]  That supports the broadcast. You really want these hypocriticals. You owe it to yourself to have these supplements.
[3:29:42.520 --> 3:29:48.520]  infowarslife.com. It's a win-win. It funds the operation. And they are really good.
[3:29:48.520 --> 3:29:59.520]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:59.520 --> 3:30:06.520]  George Soros isn't happy with Russian President Vladimir Putin for his, quote, heinous crimes against humanity in Syria.
[3:30:06.520 --> 3:30:13.520]  Soros said, the world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe of historic proportions and it's being perpetuated by the president of Russia.
[3:30:13.520 --> 3:30:21.520]  Oh, really? Well, the war awards continue to Soros allege that Russian aircraft is targeting civilians in Aleppo to assist Syrian forces on the ground.
[3:30:21.520 --> 3:30:31.520]  Aleppo, as we know, is a known ISIS stronghold. And the Russians at the invitation of the sovereign government of Syria have launched a bombing campaign against ISIS.
[3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:37.520]  The Russians successfully retook the ancient city of Palmyra from the Islamic State, something we failed to do.
[3:30:37.520 --> 3:30:44.520]  Symbolically, of course, the recapture of Palmyra means that there are defenders of civilization over barbarism. We just have words.
[3:30:44.520 --> 3:30:53.520]  Where was Soros in the 1990s when Madeline Albright stressed the human collateral damage of 500,000 Iraqi children was, quote, worth it to us?
[3:30:53.520 --> 3:30:59.520]  We must question why he suddenly cares so much now. I'm Margaret Hell reporting for infowars.com.
[3:30:59.520 --> 3:31:06.520]  More than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[3:31:06.520 --> 3:31:15.520]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[3:31:15.520 --> 3:31:22.520]  and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water. They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[3:31:22.520 --> 3:31:29.520]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[3:31:29.520 --> 3:31:42.520]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[3:31:42.520 --> 3:31:44.520]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[3:31:44.520 --> 3:31:50.520]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:27.520]  Hills are filled with fire.
[3:33:27.520 --> 3:33:30.520]  Hills are filled with fire.
[3:33:30.520 --> 3:33:33.520]  If they say I never loved you.
[3:33:33.520 --> 3:33:38.520]  If they say I never loved you.
[3:33:38.520 --> 3:33:42.520]  You know they are a liar.
[3:33:42.520 --> 3:33:44.520]  Driving down your freeway.
[3:33:44.520 --> 3:33:47.520]  Driving down your freeway.
[3:33:47.520 --> 3:33:50.520]  Hills and valleys roll.
[3:33:50.520 --> 3:33:52.520]  Midnight alleys roam.
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:56.520]  The cops in cars, the topless bars.
[3:33:56.520 --> 3:33:59.520]  Cops in cars, the topless bars.
[3:33:59.520 --> 3:34:01.520]  Never saw a woman.
[3:34:01.520 --> 3:34:03.520]  So alone.
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:05.520]  So alone.
[3:34:05.520 --> 3:34:07.520]  So alone.
[3:34:07.520 --> 3:34:09.520]  So alone.
[3:34:09.520 --> 3:34:11.520]  So alone.
[3:34:11.520 --> 3:34:13.520]  So alone.
[3:34:13.520 --> 3:34:15.520]  Motel money.
[3:34:15.520 --> 3:34:17.520]  Motel money.
[3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:19.520]  Murder madness.
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:21.520]  I know it.
[3:34:21.520 --> 3:34:25.520]  There ain't no more to glad you said that.
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:30.520]  I know what I'm going to be listening to on the freeway today.
[3:34:30.520 --> 3:34:33.520]  It's a Mojo Rising.
[3:34:33.520 --> 3:34:36.520]  All right, I'm going to have a petal for David and I appreciate the great job we did last night.
[3:34:36.520 --> 3:34:39.520]  The crew got an A+, I gave them a 97 last night.
[3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:44.520]  I got a B+, a little while during the broadcast.
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:46.520]  Should have told him to fade audio down on his screaming over Hillary.
[3:34:46.520 --> 3:34:48.520]  There's a difference, I did six hours.
[3:34:48.520 --> 3:34:52.400]  I'm the guy in the Iran is stumbling around with a bunch of arrows sticking out of me.
[3:34:52.400 --> 3:34:53.900]  So it's okay.
[3:34:53.900 --> 3:34:54.900]  But the crew is amazing.
[3:34:54.900 --> 3:34:55.900]  They did a great job.
[3:34:55.900 --> 3:34:58.100]  I'll hand the baton to David Knight.
[3:34:58.100 --> 3:34:59.100]  Here's the bottom line.
[3:34:59.100 --> 3:35:02.820]  The hoax, the big, Trump didn't say, I'm Mr. Goody two shoes.
[3:35:02.820 --> 3:35:03.820]  Oh my God.
[3:35:03.820 --> 3:35:05.180]  He said, I want to fight the globalist.
[3:35:05.180 --> 3:35:06.820]  I want to better trade deals.
[3:35:06.820 --> 3:35:08.340]  I want to cut taxes.
[3:35:08.340 --> 3:35:10.820]  We know the old crime families there.
[3:35:10.820 --> 3:35:11.820]  I'm not going to defend Trump.
[3:35:11.820 --> 3:35:16.500]  He goes sideways when he gets in office, but they're going to be after him day one.
[3:35:16.500 --> 3:35:20.860]  But buying into some hoax and it's all over, some edited tape, the bushes put out, even
[3:35:20.860 --> 3:35:22.900]  Jerry Falwell Jr. sees through it.
[3:35:22.900 --> 3:35:23.900]  That's up on info wars.com.
[3:35:23.900 --> 3:35:24.900]  We got new WikiLeaks.
[3:35:24.900 --> 3:35:27.140]  I'm talking about dead bodies and buried bodies.
[3:35:27.140 --> 3:35:30.820]  I mean, this is, thank God, WikiLeaks is putting this out.
[3:35:30.820 --> 3:35:31.820]  Just see through it.
[3:35:31.820 --> 3:35:36.180]  Now, if Hillary's in prison and they're all in trouble and stuff's better, we got a better
[3:35:36.180 --> 3:35:38.020]  candidate and Trump's doing bad stuff.
[3:35:38.020 --> 3:35:39.020]  Okay, Trump, you're in trouble.
[3:35:39.020 --> 3:35:41.020]  But I mean, it's a joke.
[3:35:41.020 --> 3:35:45.580]  Can you imagine if Trump had represented a child rapist that knew the person was guilty
[3:35:45.580 --> 3:35:50.340]  or they put a fort, a 12 year old girl in a coma, what they do to him or if he was on
[3:35:50.340 --> 3:35:51.340]  Epstein's plane.
[3:35:51.340 --> 3:35:56.660]  I mean, it's ridiculous, the hypocrisy and thank goodness that's all blowing away.
[3:35:56.660 --> 3:36:00.740]  The third time they say he's going to resign, step down or Republicans are against him.
[3:36:00.740 --> 3:36:03.460]  Don't let these Republicans creep back and support him again.
[3:36:03.460 --> 3:36:07.700]  You guys should, everybody that came out against Trump is public enemy number one should have
[3:36:07.700 --> 3:36:09.820]  recalls and should be removed.
[3:36:09.820 --> 3:36:12.420]  You pieces of trash.
[3:36:12.420 --> 3:36:16.860]  David Knight from the radio studio takes over, Nally News Tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[3:36:16.860 --> 3:36:20.420]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. before the next house takes over.
[3:36:20.420 --> 3:36:24.140]  If you're watching this transmission, history just happened.
[3:36:24.140 --> 3:36:30.260]  Trump took the gloves off in one big time despite the fact it was three against one.
[3:36:30.260 --> 3:36:31.260]  David Knight.
[3:36:31.260 --> 3:36:32.260]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:36:32.260 --> 3:36:37.820]  You know, I was just looking at this article from Geraldo Rivera saying, I've got tapes
[3:36:37.820 --> 3:36:42.140]  of embarrassing statements from Donald Trump putting this out here and I want to remind
[3:36:42.140 --> 3:36:46.220]  you of where Geraldo Rivera is coming from.
[3:36:46.220 --> 3:36:48.300]  You know, this guy is someone who just recently-
[3:36:48.300 --> 3:36:49.780]  This is Al Capone's vault.
[3:36:49.780 --> 3:36:50.780]  Yeah.
[3:36:50.780 --> 3:36:55.620]  He found him in Al Capone's vault, yeah, that was his famous episode before.
[3:36:55.620 --> 3:36:59.860]  But one of the things that he's gotten a lot of flack for recently, and maybe he's trying
[3:36:59.860 --> 3:37:06.180]  to inoculate himself from criticism because he supported Roger Ailes and he came out and
[3:37:06.180 --> 3:37:10.900]  he said, well, after he supported Roger Ailes and after Roger Ailes left, he said, I want
[3:37:10.900 --> 3:37:13.780]  to apologize for having supported him.
[3:37:13.780 --> 3:37:17.900]  And Juanita Broderick said, too little, too late.
[3:37:17.900 --> 3:37:21.980]  The same thing you did to the women Ailes abused is what you continue to do to the women
[3:37:21.980 --> 3:37:24.820]  that Bill Clinton abused, Geraldo Rivera.
[3:37:24.820 --> 3:37:29.820]  She said, not long ago, when my name was brought up during a Fox panel discussion, you said
[3:37:29.820 --> 3:37:34.380]  it made you, quote, throw up in your mouth to hear the name Juanita Broderick.
[3:37:34.380 --> 3:37:36.060]  That was the reaction that Geraldo Rivera had.
[3:37:36.060 --> 3:37:41.420]  She said, shame on you, Geraldo Rivera, you're disgusting, apology, not accepted.
[3:37:41.420 --> 3:37:46.580]  And now he's throwing out the idea, hey, I've got some stuff that I want to dump on Trump.
[3:37:46.580 --> 3:37:48.780]  Okay, what is his mission here?
[3:37:48.780 --> 3:37:52.060]  Is Geraldo trying to, again, inoculate himself?
[3:37:52.060 --> 3:37:55.580]  Has he got an agenda that he wants to purify America's speech?
[3:37:55.580 --> 3:38:00.740]  Does he want to make the White House pure, clean up the media, clean up television, clean
[3:38:00.740 --> 3:38:01.740]  up film?
[3:38:01.740 --> 3:38:02.740]  No.
[3:38:02.740 --> 3:38:09.780]  He opposes Donald Trump on policy, but this is the method he chooses to attack him, just
[3:38:09.780 --> 3:38:12.460]  as the Bushes use that method to attack him.
[3:38:12.460 --> 3:38:15.300]  And now Billy Bush has been suspended by NBC.
[3:38:15.300 --> 3:38:16.300]  Why?
[3:38:16.300 --> 3:38:19.260]  Because NBC was going to release this stuff, Billy Bush couldn't wait.
[3:38:19.260 --> 3:38:22.180]  He was working with the Clintons, and when all of this stuff that we're going to talk
[3:38:22.180 --> 3:38:26.580]  about here in just a couple of moments here that came out with Podesta's emails, very damaging
[3:38:26.580 --> 3:38:30.340]  stuff, they had to come up with something to distract you.
[3:38:30.340 --> 3:38:32.720]  They needed a red herring.
[3:38:32.720 --> 3:38:39.540]  After that, a red herring, when the Fox hounds were on the trail of the Fox, they would have
[3:38:39.540 --> 3:38:43.860]  the people that didn't like Fox hunting in England come out with stinky fish with red
[3:38:43.860 --> 3:38:48.420]  herrings and run them over the trail of the Fox when he runs by to throw the hounds off
[3:38:48.420 --> 3:38:49.420]  of the scent.
[3:38:49.420 --> 3:38:54.980]  And that's precisely what Billy Bush did for Hillary Clinton.
[3:38:54.980 --> 3:38:56.540]  They all worked together, folks.
[3:38:56.540 --> 3:39:00.980]  I thought it was pretty amazing to see how the media was coming out against Donald Trump
[3:39:00.980 --> 3:39:01.980]  yesterday.
[3:39:01.980 --> 3:39:04.380]  Think of the way Politico spun it yesterday.
[3:39:04.380 --> 3:39:09.020]  This is the conventional wisdom of the pundits yesterday before the debate.
[3:39:09.020 --> 3:39:10.500]  This was yesterday afternoon.
[3:39:10.500 --> 3:39:16.220]  Politico, Glenn Thrush says, Trump isn't merely facing an uphill battle last night.
[3:39:16.220 --> 3:39:19.220]  He said, or the widespread perception he's not up to the job, or even that he's too
[3:39:19.220 --> 3:39:20.620]  unlikable to get elected.
[3:39:20.620 --> 3:39:26.340]  No, he's having to grapple with all of these problems at once, while cloaked in disgrace,
[3:39:26.340 --> 3:39:30.340]  coping with an unprecedented defection of more than two dozen Republican former supporters
[3:39:30.340 --> 3:39:34.540]  who feel that endorsing him has become a moral transgression.
[3:39:34.540 --> 3:39:37.340]  Making a big issue out of nothing.
[3:39:37.340 --> 3:39:39.660]  That was what the red herring was about, folks.
[3:39:39.660 --> 3:39:40.940]  They were trying to throw this away.
[3:39:40.940 --> 3:39:43.860]  You understand, this is about the policy issues.
[3:39:43.860 --> 3:39:46.100]  They try to make it about something else.
[3:39:46.100 --> 3:39:50.100]  They try to make it about something that they do all the time.
[3:39:50.100 --> 3:39:55.620]  The very people who give us this pottymouth culture, this over-sexualized culture, the
[3:39:55.620 --> 3:40:01.100]  very websites that have soft-core porn or hardcore porn all over the website, they have
[3:40:01.100 --> 3:40:03.620]  a problem with what he had to say.
[3:40:03.620 --> 3:40:08.860]  Yeah, it's the society we live in, unfortunately, it's the society we live in, but what hypocrisy
[3:40:08.860 --> 3:40:09.860]  for these people.
[3:40:09.860 --> 3:40:14.620]  As I said last night, it was like Matt Damien, who makes all of his money doing films about
[3:40:14.620 --> 3:40:20.380]  born, Jason Bourne and guns, coming out to try to shut down guns.
[3:40:20.380 --> 3:40:22.220]  But Trump really was the man in the arena.
[3:40:22.220 --> 3:40:27.860]  He rose to the occasion last night, but even after that, we see Bob Schieffer, the former
[3:40:27.860 --> 3:40:32.140]  face-the-nation host, saying, I am disgusted with this.
[3:40:32.140 --> 3:40:36.180]  This was disgraceful what happened last night when Donald Trump won.
[3:40:36.180 --> 3:40:41.380]  When Donald Trump did the unprecedented and brought out these women who were victims of
[3:40:41.380 --> 3:40:46.340]  Bill Clinton to emphasize the fact that we're not talking about consensual sex with Bill
[3:40:46.340 --> 3:40:47.340]  Clinton.
[3:40:47.340 --> 3:40:48.540]  It was never about that.
[3:40:48.540 --> 3:40:52.500]  The media made it about that 20-some-odd years ago.
[3:40:52.500 --> 3:40:54.620]  They made it about Monica Lewinsky.
[3:40:54.620 --> 3:40:56.100]  They made it about Jennifer Flowers.
[3:40:56.100 --> 3:41:00.500]  They didn't want to talk about Juanita Broderick and those issues.
[3:41:00.500 --> 3:41:01.780]  They didn't want to talk about the rape.
[3:41:01.780 --> 3:41:03.380]  They wanted to say, well, he's having an affairs.
[3:41:03.380 --> 3:41:04.380]  And guess what?
[3:41:04.380 --> 3:41:08.180]  All the people who were shaking their heads and going tisk, tisk, tisk about what Donald
[3:41:08.180 --> 3:41:13.820]  Trump said, and I'm not defending his comments about trying to commit adultery.
[3:41:13.820 --> 3:41:17.900]  But these same people saw it as a badge of honor for Bill Clinton.
[3:41:17.900 --> 3:41:22.540]  He became even more popular with the very Democrats who are now criticizing Donald
[3:41:22.540 --> 3:41:23.540]  Trump.
[3:41:23.540 --> 3:41:27.620]  But here's what Bob Schieffer said last night because he was so distraught about the fact
[3:41:27.620 --> 3:41:33.540]  that Donald Trump turned this around, went on the offensive, and made some great points.
[3:41:33.540 --> 3:41:35.700]  So Bob Schieffer says, this is disgraceful.
[3:41:35.700 --> 3:41:40.780]  He says, here we're marching in women into the hall who are supposed to have some relationship
[3:41:40.780 --> 3:41:42.780]  with one of the candidate's spouses.
[3:41:42.780 --> 3:41:44.300]  What's that supposed to prove?
[3:41:44.300 --> 3:41:50.460]  Well, it proves that Hillary Clinton has, from the very beginning of her career, thrown
[3:41:50.460 --> 3:41:53.660]  women under the bus for her career.
[3:41:53.660 --> 3:41:57.940]  Just as she did that 12-year-old girl, threw her under the bus, laughed about how she got
[3:41:57.940 --> 3:42:02.620]  this rapist of a 12-year-old girl off the hook on a technicality.
[3:42:02.620 --> 3:42:08.020]  And she has done that for Bill Clinton time and again and again and again.
[3:42:08.020 --> 3:42:09.940]  And so Donald Trump brought those women in.
[3:42:09.940 --> 3:42:15.060]  And to remind people, this is not about consensual sex, this is about rape.
[3:42:15.060 --> 3:42:18.740]  And it is about the woman who covers for the rapist.
[3:42:18.740 --> 3:42:22.820]  The woman who throws the women under the bus and says, vote for me because I'm a woman.
[3:42:22.820 --> 3:42:23.820]  I'm all about women.
[3:42:23.820 --> 3:42:24.820]  Yeah, right.
[3:42:24.820 --> 3:42:26.980]  But he says, listen to what he had to say.
[3:42:26.980 --> 3:42:30.380]  They're supposed to have had some relationship?
[3:42:30.380 --> 3:42:31.860]  See how Bob Schieffer spends that?
[3:42:31.860 --> 3:42:33.300]  They're still selling that.
[3:42:33.300 --> 3:42:38.780]  These women are supposed to have had some relationship with the spouse of a candidate?
[3:42:38.780 --> 3:42:40.220]  Not a liar.
[3:42:40.220 --> 3:42:43.620]  What a, you know, Bob Schieffer, you are a disgrace.
[3:42:43.620 --> 3:42:47.980]  You and CBS and NBC and the rest of these people who have their hidden agenda, who are
[3:42:47.980 --> 3:42:53.540]  rigging this, you're a bunch of liars, crooks and thieves, absolutely amazing what they
[3:42:53.540 --> 3:42:54.540]  did.
[3:42:54.540 --> 3:42:57.220]  Donald Trump nailed Hillary Clinton last night.
[3:42:57.220 --> 3:43:01.580]  She came out and she said, well, I'm not happy with Citizens United.
[3:43:01.580 --> 3:43:05.060]  That Supreme Court decision that says political speech is free speech.
[3:43:05.060 --> 3:43:10.580]  She may not like it that people with a lot of money jump into this thing, but that truly
[3:43:10.580 --> 3:43:11.740]  is free speech.
[3:43:11.740 --> 3:43:18.300]  I know one of the people who was involved in Citizens United and it wasn't simply about
[3:43:18.300 --> 3:43:19.300]  big money.
[3:43:19.300 --> 3:43:24.100]  Understand, the big guys know how to navigate the rules.
[3:43:24.100 --> 3:43:26.220]  They know how to navigate the FEC.
[3:43:26.220 --> 3:43:30.260]  They know how to give millions of dollars to the candidate that they want to give money
[3:43:30.260 --> 3:43:31.260]  to.
[3:43:31.260 --> 3:43:32.260]  No question about that.
[3:43:32.260 --> 3:43:37.780]  Because the small guys, they get trapped like Dinesh D'Souza, who didn't understand the
[3:43:37.780 --> 3:43:38.780]  rules.
[3:43:38.780 --> 3:43:42.980]  Dinesh D'Souza could have easily given $25,000 to his college friend.
[3:43:42.980 --> 3:43:47.020]  If he had gone through a super PAC, he could have created a super PAC, filed the paperwork
[3:43:47.020 --> 3:43:48.660]  with the FEC and so forth and so on.
[3:43:48.660 --> 3:43:51.620]  These other people are giving millions of dollars to these candidates and get away with
[3:43:51.620 --> 3:43:52.620]  it.
[3:43:52.620 --> 3:43:53.620]  Don't have a problem with it.
[3:43:53.620 --> 3:43:59.900]  See, the rich people will always find a way covertly, criminally, or whatever they need
[3:43:59.900 --> 3:44:06.500]  to do, but they'll invent a legal structure that nobody else can do to give this money.
[3:44:06.500 --> 3:44:11.100]  So what Citizens United did was it was about some people in Montana who were being shut
[3:44:11.100 --> 3:44:14.740]  down, not able to exercise their freedom of speech.
[3:44:14.740 --> 3:44:17.660]  It was a citizen advocacy group.
[3:44:17.660 --> 3:44:20.140]  And I know one of the people that was involved in that.
[3:44:20.140 --> 3:44:22.220]  And I agree with what was done with that.
[3:44:22.220 --> 3:44:25.980]  Now, people look at this and say, well, it's freed up big money from corporations.
[3:44:25.980 --> 3:44:27.940]  They're like, you don't understand.
[3:44:27.940 --> 3:44:30.900]  The corporations are free to put their money through as they wish.
[3:44:30.900 --> 3:44:35.820]  They will find a way to get that through the laws or for the little gnats.
[3:44:35.820 --> 3:44:39.740]  The big bees will go through those spider webs with no problem whatsoever.
[3:44:39.740 --> 3:44:42.220]  And so that's really what Citizens United was about.
[3:44:42.220 --> 3:44:44.780]  But okay, you want to complain about Citizens United, Hillary?
[3:44:44.780 --> 3:44:48.100]  Donald Trump challenged Hillary Clinton to spend her own money.
[3:44:48.100 --> 3:44:51.900]  This was Washington Times on her presidential campaign on Sunday saying it would give her
[3:44:51.900 --> 3:44:54.540]  some independence from her donors.
[3:44:54.540 --> 3:44:59.700]  Clinton had blasted the Citizens United court decision that opened the door to groups spending
[3:44:59.700 --> 3:45:02.940]  unlimited money to get a message out on elections.
[3:45:02.940 --> 3:45:07.340]  She said she would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn that ruling.
[3:45:07.340 --> 3:45:09.580]  And so Donald Trump called her on her bluff.
[3:45:09.580 --> 3:45:12.100]  He says, hey, you don't have to wait for that.
[3:45:12.100 --> 3:45:13.300]  You can spend your own money.
[3:45:13.300 --> 3:45:16.740]  You don't have to be beholden to Wall Street.
[3:45:16.740 --> 3:45:20.380]  You don't have to give those quarter of a million dollar speeches and do them over and
[3:45:20.380 --> 3:45:21.380]  over again.
[3:45:21.380 --> 3:45:24.860]  You have $222 million talking to bankers on Wall Street.
[3:45:24.860 --> 3:45:25.860]  You can use your own money.
[3:45:25.860 --> 3:45:30.300]  You've made a lot of money with those speeches, so you don't have to rely on Citizens United.
[3:45:30.300 --> 3:45:31.700]  Go ahead and do it, Hillary.
[3:45:31.700 --> 3:45:32.700]  He called her bluff.
[3:45:32.700 --> 3:45:36.660]  He came out and said, well, I'm going to spend up to $100 million on my own money on the
[3:45:36.660 --> 3:45:37.660]  campaign.
[3:45:37.660 --> 3:45:39.660]  So he challenged her to spend $30 million.
[3:45:39.660 --> 3:45:41.980]  Why don't you spend $30 million, Hillary?
[3:45:41.980 --> 3:45:48.220]  Out of the $250 million, you and your husband have gotten from Wall Street speeches.
[3:45:48.220 --> 3:45:50.900]  He says, why don't you put some money in?
[3:45:50.900 --> 3:45:51.900]  That's what?
[3:45:51.900 --> 3:45:53.460]  Hillary didn't say anything.
[3:45:53.460 --> 3:45:56.060]  That was a key thing last night.
[3:45:56.060 --> 3:46:01.460]  When Donald Trump finally turned, he got tired of people attacking him again and again and
[3:46:01.460 --> 3:46:06.300]  again on this stuff that was released by the Bushes for the Clintons.
[3:46:06.300 --> 3:46:07.300]  He got tired of it.
[3:46:07.300 --> 3:46:08.820]  First they came up with a questioner.
[3:46:08.820 --> 3:46:09.820]  That was enough.
[3:46:09.820 --> 3:46:12.620]  So then Anderson Cooper comes out, then Hillary Clinton comes and then they hit him again.
[3:46:12.620 --> 3:46:13.900]  And it's like, okay, you know what?
[3:46:13.900 --> 3:46:16.020]  All right, let's tell you what this is really about.
[3:46:16.020 --> 3:46:19.780]  And then at that point, he took over the debate and he was in control.
[3:46:19.780 --> 3:46:24.860]  And when he called Hillary Clinton out on what she had done with the emails, she had
[3:46:24.860 --> 3:46:27.220]  absolutely nothing to say.
[3:46:27.220 --> 3:46:32.060]  She had this stammering, repetitive statement about, well, fact checking, fact checking,
[3:46:32.060 --> 3:46:33.060]  fact checking.
[3:46:33.060 --> 3:46:35.300]  Go to my website and you will see what the facts are.
[3:46:35.300 --> 3:46:36.860]  Read my version of the facts.
[3:46:36.860 --> 3:46:38.940]  I fact check all this stuff about the emails.
[3:46:38.940 --> 3:46:41.260]  We know what's going on with the emails, Hillary.
[3:46:41.260 --> 3:46:44.220]  We don't need to go see your spend on your website.
[3:46:44.220 --> 3:46:45.780]  We know precisely what's there.
[3:46:45.780 --> 3:46:49.420]  She finished up by saying, and I don't like the character of somebody like Donald Trump
[3:46:49.420 --> 3:46:54.060]  boy, sure, good thing that we don't have Donald Trump as somebody with his character
[3:46:54.060 --> 3:46:55.060]  as president.
[3:46:55.060 --> 3:46:57.700]  He says, yeah, because you'd be in jail.
[3:46:57.700 --> 3:47:00.940]  And that didn't get any better for her the rest of the time through.
[3:47:00.940 --> 3:47:06.260]  Now, when we look at these emails, and I think this is the real story, this is why they came
[3:47:06.260 --> 3:47:11.300]  out with this garbage from the Bushes, from Billy Bush.
[3:47:11.300 --> 3:47:14.300]  They didn't want you to see what Hillary Clinton was talking about.
[3:47:14.300 --> 3:47:20.900]  One of the things that has bothered me since the 90s was how she got away with cattle gates.
[3:47:20.900 --> 3:47:26.020]  And as I said yesterday on the broadcast, it was a classic sting moment.
[3:47:26.020 --> 3:47:30.700]  Remember the sting with Robert Redford and Paul Newman?
[3:47:30.700 --> 3:47:35.900]  The way they got the guy that they were taking down was to set up the celebrity hoax where
[3:47:35.900 --> 3:47:38.340]  they go to a place where there's a horse race that's being broadcast.
[3:47:38.340 --> 3:47:42.180]  So it's a real horse race, but they delay it a little while.
[3:47:42.180 --> 3:47:46.340]  So they know how to lay the bets off, and they trick this guy because they know they
[3:47:46.340 --> 3:47:50.380]  got like a five to 10 minute delay on who the winner was.
[3:47:50.380 --> 3:47:52.100]  And that's how they take this guy down.
[3:47:52.100 --> 3:47:54.260]  That's what Hillary Clinton did with cattle gate.
[3:47:54.260 --> 3:47:55.460]  You got to understand that.
[3:47:55.460 --> 3:47:59.220]  So she goes to a bunch of Wall Street hedge fund managers, and she says, you know, it's
[3:47:59.220 --> 3:48:02.380]  always been a little bit risky for me to come and speak to a group that's committed to the
[3:48:02.380 --> 3:48:06.620]  futures market because, and there's a few knowing laughs, she says, she acknowledges,
[3:48:06.620 --> 3:48:07.620]  hi, you guys are chuckling.
[3:48:07.620 --> 3:48:08.620]  Yeah, you know what?
[3:48:08.620 --> 3:48:12.180]  She goes over on those schmucks, the voters, the American public.
[3:48:12.180 --> 3:48:15.700]  She says, many years ago, I actually traded in the futures market.
[3:48:15.700 --> 3:48:20.740]  I worked with a group of like-minded friends and associates who traded in pork bellies
[3:48:20.740 --> 3:48:23.820]  and cotton and other such things, and I did pretty well.
[3:48:23.820 --> 3:48:27.460]  I invested about $1,000, and I traded up to about $100,000.
[3:48:27.460 --> 3:48:31.700]  She did that in a very short period of time, and then she was done because that's the way
[3:48:31.700 --> 3:48:36.060]  Hillary Clinton laundered her money in the 1990s.
[3:48:36.060 --> 3:48:40.980]  She's got a squeaky clean little tax return that's been prepared for her by the law firm
[3:48:40.980 --> 3:48:45.740]  that Comey and Loretta Lynch used to work for, or at least to do her taxes, you realize,
[3:48:45.740 --> 3:48:46.740]  okay?
[3:48:46.740 --> 3:48:48.620]  That's why they're not going to prosecute her.
[3:48:48.620 --> 3:48:52.660]  These people are her minions from way back, but she has these squeaky clean little tax
[3:48:52.660 --> 3:48:55.980]  returns, but she does things like Cattlegate.
[3:48:55.980 --> 3:48:58.300]  She does things like the Clinton Foundation.
[3:48:58.300 --> 3:48:59.660]  That's where the big money is.
[3:48:59.660 --> 3:49:01.820]  That's where she rolls this stuff out, okay?
[3:49:01.820 --> 3:49:07.740]  Now, the biggest thing, and we keep coming back to this, I think, is her dream.
[3:49:07.740 --> 3:49:09.620]  Her dream that she told the bankers.
[3:49:09.620 --> 3:49:14.300]  My dream, she said, and of course, her dream, folks, is your nightmare.
[3:49:14.300 --> 3:49:20.980]  A hemispheric common market with open borders and a future with energy that's green and
[3:49:20.980 --> 3:49:23.660]  sustainable as we can get it, and we all get rich.
[3:49:23.660 --> 3:49:26.020]  No, she will get rich.
[3:49:26.020 --> 3:49:30.660]  You will be locked into the cities into an agenda 21 existence.
[3:49:30.660 --> 3:49:31.660]  That is the dream they have.
[3:49:31.660 --> 3:49:36.500]  They're taking down our countries, creating, and that's what the NAFTA trade agreement
[3:49:36.500 --> 3:49:37.500]  was about.
[3:49:37.500 --> 3:49:39.100]  That's what the European Union is about.
[3:49:39.100 --> 3:49:46.060]  It's about creating a political, they create the euro, they create the NAFTA trade agreement.
[3:49:46.060 --> 3:49:47.660]  They do this economically.
[3:49:47.660 --> 3:49:48.900]  They create an economic union.
[3:49:48.900 --> 3:49:52.500]  That's what they're doing now, the transatlantic, trans-Pacific partnerships.
[3:49:52.500 --> 3:49:58.660]  They're creating economic structures that will then be used to create economic disaster,
[3:49:58.660 --> 3:50:00.140]  to put political pressure on.
[3:50:00.140 --> 3:50:05.180]  As we saw the problems with the euro, we heard all last year.
[3:50:05.180 --> 3:50:08.260]  The only way we're going to solve this is with greater political consolidation.
[3:50:08.260 --> 3:50:12.620]  And of course, there's been a couple of things that have come out over the weekend, and we
[3:50:12.620 --> 3:50:19.540]  can see how this agenda 21 UN agenda is going to be put on us.
[3:50:19.540 --> 3:50:24.820]  Understand, these folks have for the longest time had a goal of between, and the years
[3:50:24.820 --> 3:50:28.820]  have always been, 2020, 2025, or 2030.
[3:50:28.820 --> 3:50:32.780]  They're always talking about that's when everything is going to happen.
[3:50:32.780 --> 3:50:34.660]  What is the future going to look like for you?
[3:50:34.660 --> 3:50:37.340]  I'm going to tell you when we come back what that's going to look like.
[3:50:37.340 --> 3:50:43.100]  We've got European governments right now saying they're going to ban all internal combustion
[3:50:43.100 --> 3:50:44.100]  engines.
[3:50:44.100 --> 3:50:46.500]  They're going to ban drivers from the roads.
[3:50:46.500 --> 3:50:49.500]  They're going to take control of our transportation.
[3:50:49.500 --> 3:50:50.500]  We'll be right back.
[3:50:50.500 --> 3:51:01.500]  Stay with us.
[3:51:01.500 --> 3:51:02.500]  Extendivite.
[3:51:02.500 --> 3:51:07.860]  A seven herb combination of garlic, cayenne, hotthorn, bilberry, ginko bloba, balearion,
[3:51:07.860 --> 3:51:09.580]  and milk thistle.
[3:51:09.580 --> 3:51:13.500]  Extendivite is designed to strengthen the heart and arteries and help the body heal
[3:51:13.500 --> 3:51:14.500]  itself.
[3:51:14.500 --> 3:51:18.860]  Doctors are not able to explain the improvements they're seeing in their patients' health
[3:51:18.860 --> 3:51:20.980]  who are taking Extendivite.
[3:51:20.980 --> 3:51:25.540]  People who once needed more pills are now taking less and getting better.
[3:51:25.540 --> 3:51:30.460]  Due to the unexplainable improvements in their patients' health, more doctors are calling
[3:51:30.460 --> 3:51:33.340]  to order Extendivite for themselves.
[3:51:33.340 --> 3:51:36.420]  Help Extendivite make your doctor a believer.

[3:53:00.180 --> 3:53:03.820]  Dr. Waddle Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe.
[3:53:03.820 --> 3:53:06.620]  He also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells.
[3:53:06.620 --> 3:53:10.380]  He discovered the one prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency.
[3:53:10.380 --> 3:53:14.820]  Dr. Joanna Budwig, built upon the work of Dr. Warburg, had discovered how to feed the
[3:53:14.820 --> 3:53:17.620]  cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency.
[3:53:17.620 --> 3:53:21.300]  She found that it was a sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax
[3:53:21.300 --> 3:53:25.500]  oil that the flax oil would become emulsified and more readily absorbed.
[3:53:25.500 --> 3:53:29.460]  Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of
[3:53:29.460 --> 3:53:30.460]  the body.
[3:53:30.460 --> 3:53:34.220]  Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality, zero
[3:53:34.220 --> 3:53:36.540]  oxidation, undamaged seed oils.
[3:53:36.540 --> 3:53:39.220]  The results on these seed oils alone are amazing.
[3:53:39.220 --> 3:53:43.180]  Now add our life force enhanced one-world-way protein powder that is much higher in the
[3:53:43.180 --> 3:53:47.940]  sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is and you have a winning combination to confer
[3:53:47.940 --> 3:53:50.140]  health and energy like never before.

[3:53:55.980 --> 3:54:16.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, I'm going to give you a picture of
[3:54:16.500 --> 3:54:17.500]  the future.
[3:54:17.500 --> 3:54:22.860]  Hillary Clinton's dream, your nightmare, being locked into the cities into your little
[3:54:22.860 --> 3:54:27.300]  200 square foot padded cell and I'm going to tell you how they're going to do that in
[3:54:27.300 --> 3:54:29.100]  just a moment before I do real quickly.
[3:54:29.100 --> 3:54:36.100]  I want to remind you that we have ending soon our sale on DNA force, 23% off at infowarslife.com

[3:55:12.180 --> 3:55:17.980]  and we talk about power supplies, solar power supplies I think is a great idea to have your
[3:55:17.980 --> 3:55:22.340]  own power supply to be off the grid, to be independent but understand that when we're
[3:55:22.340 --> 3:55:28.500]  talking about banning the internal combustion engine about shutting down driving that is
[3:55:28.500 --> 3:55:32.900]  not about getting independence that's the exact opposite.
[3:55:32.900 --> 3:55:38.100]  That is about subjecting you to a control grid that is how they're going to implement
[3:55:38.100 --> 3:55:39.100]  agenda 21.
[3:55:39.100 --> 3:55:45.060]  You look at agenda 21 you look at the UN agenda for sustainable development, the 2030 agenda
[3:55:45.060 --> 3:55:48.940]  for sustainable development and you say yeah nobody's going to want to be confined to the
[3:55:48.940 --> 3:55:53.420]  cities like this and the cars freed us from the cities.
[3:55:53.420 --> 3:55:57.820]  Most people don't want to live in crowded expensive disease ridden cities.
[3:55:57.820 --> 3:56:02.260]  Thomas Jefferson said cities are a threat to the health, the wealth and the liberty
[3:56:02.260 --> 3:56:06.980]  of man and it's never been more true than it is today so cars gave us the opportunity
[3:56:06.980 --> 3:56:12.780]  to get to the suburbs and the central planners, the people who run the cities have hated them
[3:56:12.780 --> 3:56:13.780]  ever since.
[3:56:13.780 --> 3:56:17.220]  They've done everything to make it difficult but now look at what they're doing.
[3:56:17.220 --> 3:56:24.580]  We had in Europe we had first back in April we had Norway and Sweden say that they were
[3:56:24.580 --> 3:56:28.660]  going to ban internal combustion engines by 2025 and at the time they did that everybody
[3:56:28.660 --> 3:56:31.980]  said well France and Germany are going to have something to say about that they're
[3:56:31.980 --> 3:56:37.260]  not going to do something that radical ban internal combustion engines within nine years.
[3:56:37.260 --> 3:56:43.180]  Well over the weekend we had the German parliamentary procedure come out and say that they want
[3:56:43.180 --> 3:56:49.380]  to ban internal combustion engines by 2030 and they want to push the EU to do this.
[3:56:49.380 --> 3:56:53.500]  Germany is the EU folks you have to understand that they have taken over that government
[3:56:53.500 --> 3:56:59.780]  that is they they have done with the European Union what Hitler could not do what Kaiser
[3:56:59.780 --> 3:57:01.620]  Wilhelm could not do.
[3:57:01.620 --> 3:57:05.340]  They're going to ban internal combustion engines in Europe what are they doing in the United
[3:57:05.340 --> 3:57:08.420]  States you think they're going to do it here of course they will and of course when they
[3:57:08.420 --> 3:57:14.260]  ban them in Europe it's going to put pressure on global car manufacturers to go to electric
[3:57:14.260 --> 3:57:18.380]  cars whatever with limited range with all the problems that are involved in that that's
[3:57:18.380 --> 3:57:23.260]  what the war against Volkswagen against the clean diesel fuel is all about.
[3:57:23.260 --> 3:57:27.940]  But now look at this new front here we have on Road and Track magazine this weekend they
[3:57:27.940 --> 3:57:33.660]  said Feds set a goal of zero US traffic deaths within 30 years.
[3:57:33.660 --> 3:57:36.820]  Let me tell you something whenever you see some kind of utopian pronouncements from a
[3:57:36.820 --> 3:57:40.300]  government you've got to know that there's going to be authoritarian mandates coming
[3:57:40.300 --> 3:57:45.740]  down the road how are they going to enforce this we've got five different federal agencies
[3:57:45.740 --> 3:57:51.420]  from the US Department of Transportation all the way down everybody that touches cars and
[3:57:51.420 --> 3:57:56.500]  trucks all of these agencies are working on this goal they've even got a name for it the
[3:57:56.500 --> 3:58:03.140]  road to zero the road to zero boy does that say at all they're going to lock you in your
[3:58:03.140 --> 3:58:08.300]  200 square foot padded sale inside the cities where you'll be safe as long as you don't
[3:58:08.300 --> 3:58:13.780]  have a bathtub or something else that can kill you this is the insanity this is what
[3:58:13.780 --> 3:58:17.860]  they're doing and this is the way they're going to do it they're going to control the
[3:58:17.860 --> 3:58:21.980]  guns they're going to control your transportation they're going to surveil you everywhere you
[3:58:21.980 --> 3:58:25.740]  go they're going to make cars part of the internet of things join us tonight for them
[3:58:25.740 --> 3:58:33.780]  for worse nightly news 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern
