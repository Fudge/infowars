[00:00.000 --> 00:12.260]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.260 --> 00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.920 --> 00:37.040]  Alex Jones
[00:37.040 --> 00:44.360]  ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday the 31st day of January 2013 I am your host
[00:44.360 --> 00:47.280]  Alex Jones we're going to be here obviously live for the next three hours
[00:47.280 --> 00:50.960]  and each day it just gets more insane
[00:50.960 --> 00:54.160]  Larry Pratt the head of gun owners of America had met on with us in a few
[00:54.160 --> 00:54.880]  weeks
[00:54.880 --> 01:00.600]  he's going to give us a update on the latest legislative developments that are
[01:00.600 --> 01:04.960]  taking place with the attack on the Second Amendment we've got absolutely
[01:04.960 --> 01:07.920]  key news in that area
[01:07.920 --> 01:13.600]  Homeland Security has advised for confronting mass murderers in their new
[01:13.600 --> 01:16.920]  training seminars they say fight back with scissors
[01:16.920 --> 01:20.640]  that's right now government all has bodyguards with guns and billionaires
[01:20.640 --> 01:26.360]  all have bodyguards with guns and Diane Feinstein has it and people like
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.720]  Bloomberg people like Michael Moore but you need to fight back against someone
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.080]  with a semi-automatic with scissors so I can't make that up
[01:35.080 --> 01:41.760]  we've got thousands of Green Berets signing a petition and signing an open
[01:41.760 --> 01:45.560]  letter to the White House saying we will not be part of taking guns over a
[01:45.560 --> 01:48.080]  thousand Green Berets signed letters supporting Second Amendment
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.240]  that's all up at our news websites infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and
[01:53.240 --> 01:57.480]  I'm going to cover that again next hour when Larry Pratt joins us
[01:57.480 --> 02:01.080]  I'll get into some of it coming up the next segment Paul Watson's popping in
[02:01.080 --> 02:07.080]  because we picked up earlier in the week on a report of a British defense
[02:07.080 --> 02:12.400]  contractor thousands of pages scanned passports British social security
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.960]  numbers I mean it looked like a real hack or if it was a forgery I mean it
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.640]  was like you know writing a five-volume book it looked very accurate and the
[02:21.640 --> 02:25.000]  companies come out and said yes it was a real hack but somebody inserted a few
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.160]  emails claiming that we were getting offers to help stage a chemical attack
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.800]  there in Syria to be blamed on the Syrian government well that fits in with
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.040]  Israel saying if we think there's any nerve gas we're gonna start attacking
[02:40.040 --> 02:43.800]  government facilities because we're worried about rebels getting them rebels
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.360]  backed by the West and there's even a libertarian party blog out today saying
[02:48.360 --> 02:55.240]  Israel and the Syrian opposition strange bedfellows because then as you know
[02:55.240 --> 03:02.800]  Israel launched a bunch of airstrikes on facilities they claim were transferring
[03:02.800 --> 03:07.680]  nerve gas to rebels I mean the last thing Assad would ever do who has no
[03:07.680 --> 03:13.160]  history of aggression to outside countries would be to use or give rebels
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.240]  nerve gas I mean that that's that's the pretext to attack them and then they've
[03:17.240 --> 03:26.920]  said that this is all a setup this has been on going now for quite some time
[03:26.920 --> 03:33.200]  23 months or so that the West has been funding al-qaeda as the leadership and
[03:33.200 --> 03:38.080]  several other jihadi groups out of Saudi Arabia Qatar and a few other nations
[03:38.080 --> 03:44.120]  against that country and they already of course handed Libya over to al-qaeda I
[03:44.120 --> 03:50.640]  mean this is just unprecedented to have the United States NATO France right at
[03:50.640 --> 03:56.360]  the head of it and now Israel openly involved trying to knock out the Assad
[03:56.360 --> 04:01.680]  regime and then al-qaeda will come into command and then meanwhile they're
[04:01.680 --> 04:07.160]  saying everyone will be fully groped by the TSA the TSA at the Super Bowl and
[04:07.160 --> 04:11.800]  they're running checkpoints on highways and roads in every major city including
[04:11.800 --> 04:17.680]  Austin now as of last week saying because of al-qaeda I mean it is just
[04:17.680 --> 04:22.880]  absolute balderdash and they're now converting over from saying well it's for
[04:22.880 --> 04:26.680]  al-qaeda it's for conservatives libertarians constitutionalists so we
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.560]  are living in a twilight zone world Russia concerned with Israeli attack in
[04:30.560 --> 04:36.200]  Syria reportedly a Russian MIG then went into some Israeli controlled areas until
[04:36.200 --> 04:42.240]  warned off Syria Iran threatened consequences for Israeli strike Israel
[04:42.240 --> 04:45.840]  jet blast arms shipment inside Syria that's what the Wall Street Journal just
[04:45.840 --> 04:52.320]  just just goes with this as if it must be true this is a new level of brazen
[04:52.320 --> 04:57.760]  bizarre onus by the ruling establishment globalist we'll be right back ladies and

[08:24.200 --> 08:30.040]  ladies and gentlemen you have got it frontline seats for the open birth of a
[08:30.040 --> 08:35.920]  planetary fascistic world government that uses socialism at the grassroots to
[08:35.920 --> 08:40.840]  basically enslave the population like flypaper while an international global
[08:40.840 --> 08:46.000]  fascist elite writes the world laws and exempts themselves from taxation and
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.320]  regulation designed to impoverish and destroy middle classes worldwide the
[08:51.320 --> 08:58.040]  ancient enemy of all oligarchs corrupt kings and criminal syndicates is the
[08:58.040 --> 09:02.120]  independent yeoman farmer that Thomas Jefferson talked about being the key to
[09:02.120 --> 09:07.760]  any free society the free middle-class independent yeoman farmer has always
[09:07.760 --> 09:11.880]  been the enemy of tyranny the yeoman farmer in the last hundred and fifty
[09:11.880 --> 09:17.640]  years since the acceleration of the Industrial Revolution is the middle
[09:17.640 --> 09:22.320]  class is the shop owner is the business owner is the small factory owner is the
[09:22.320 --> 09:27.640]  restaurant owner but still the farmer is the number one enemy that's why you've
[09:27.640 --> 09:33.960]  seen programs to bankrupt and annihilate the family farm now that is incredibly
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.320]  incredibly rare okay just want to lay out the battle plan of the globalist
[09:39.320 --> 09:42.880]  here world government is being openly announced again as the solution to all
[09:42.880 --> 09:46.840]  our problems we're going to get into that incredible Second Amendment
[09:46.840 --> 09:51.920]  development news some good news some bad news some ugly news and a lot of news in
[09:51.920 --> 09:56.400]  between that is all coming up today as well Larry Pratt had been on in a few
[09:56.400 --> 10:00.080]  weeks head of governors of America will get an update at the start of the next
[10:00.080 --> 10:06.160]  hour constitutional lawyer Ron Paul's chief legal advisor advisor to Congress
[10:06.160 --> 10:10.480]  Bruce fine was gonna be on yesterday he got stuck in court on an important
[10:10.480 --> 10:14.480]  matter he'll be joining us today had been on in about four months to chart
[10:14.480 --> 10:20.760]  the incredibly draconian developments that we've seen just since he was last
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.840]  on I guess about three months ago so that is coming up as well just bizarro
[10:25.840 --> 10:29.960]  announcements by Homeland Security on the Second Amendment here's one of them
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.680]  Homeland Security has advice for confronting mass murderers scissors not
[10:34.680 --> 10:39.680]  firearms you can't make that up we got a link to that New York Post article up at
[10:39.680 --> 10:47.920]  info wars calm and prison planet calm obviously we're also going to get in to
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.480]  a story out of ABC News that when I saw it I instantly thought of Spaceballs
[10:53.480 --> 10:58.440]  where they have the canned air the president of the planet's baseball and
[10:58.440 --> 11:02.360]  and he's telling the media oh no there's no air shortage don't worry and then he
[11:02.360 --> 11:09.000]  opens a can of air they're now selling cans of air in Beijing because the air
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.520]  has never been this bad except in 1954 now again folks the jet stream of China
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.360]  blows right across the Midwest and dumps in over the United States and that's why
[11:20.360 --> 11:24.520]  people are sick all over the Midwest okay there's major university studies on
[11:24.520 --> 11:27.960]  it I'm going to pull them up again and do a report on that soon because the
[11:27.960 --> 11:31.400]  media is not picking up on this they're saying we've got to shut down basically
[11:31.400 --> 11:35.360]  everybody's cars factories you name it that are totally clean in many cases
[11:35.360 --> 11:42.040]  because the particulate is going off the chart from from the worst area is from
[11:42.040 --> 11:48.680]  about New Mexico over to Mississippi and then right up to as far north as
[11:48.680 --> 11:52.520]  Chicago that's where that main jet stream dumps in it comes into about a
[11:52.520 --> 11:57.280]  thousand feet over mainland China if you look on the globe we're lined up with
[11:57.280 --> 12:04.080]  China the Midwest is and then it comes in and dumps in right over right over
[12:04.080 --> 12:07.760]  the Midwest and right over Texas it's just that's what's going on that's why
[12:07.760 --> 12:12.600]  everybody's so sick and China is just there's no controls there I saw an
[12:12.600 --> 12:16.120]  article where their biggest river was bright red the other day it was so toxic
[12:16.120 --> 12:21.680]  every week a major river set on fire there's there's there's hundreds of
[12:21.680 --> 12:25.680]  riots a week by the people rebelling there's suicide nets being put up at
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.080]  hundreds of factories people are finding any tall building and jumping off I mean
[12:30.080 --> 12:35.600]  it is just cuckoo land over there and we are competing with that
[12:35.600 --> 12:39.320]  they're kicking the Chinese off all their rural area where they were happy
[12:39.320 --> 12:42.800]  and providing food for themselves and forcing them into compact cities they
[12:42.800 --> 12:46.720]  chain their kids to power poles and then go in and work in the factories all day
[12:46.720 --> 12:50.640]  now we're not going to compete with that there's no way and they're bringing more
[12:50.640 --> 12:57.720]  regulations in on us we're done that's the plan totally shut us down now all of
[12:57.720 --> 13:00.720]  that and I'm gonna get to it after Paul Watson leaves us at the bottom of the
[13:00.720 --> 13:06.480]  hour all of that pales in significance there's something right out of biblical
[13:06.480 --> 13:13.920]  revelation right out of the Bible where you've got Russia that's described by
[13:13.920 --> 13:20.960]  the ancient name and Syria described by its ancient name Syria in a war with
[13:20.960 --> 13:26.160]  Israel I mean this listen the Russians according to Israeli press we're going
[13:26.160 --> 13:30.880]  to get into that sent fighter jets into the Israeli border the Russians are
[13:30.880 --> 13:36.040]  saying they may respond openly the biggest part of the Russian fleet is
[13:36.040 --> 13:41.200]  right off the coast one ship alone 2,000 Marines this is a 23 month proxy war
[13:41.200 --> 13:48.480]  with the bankers that run America NATO and now Israel Turkey's the main
[13:48.480 --> 13:54.040]  staging ground with u.s. bases training al-qaeda using heavy artillery to sweep
[13:54.040 --> 13:58.320]  areas to insert more al-qaeda al-qaeda is cutting Christians heads off burning
[13:58.320 --> 14:03.040]  churches Assad is no angel but compared to al-qaeda he is an angel he's never
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.280]  attacked outside countries but he's not part of the New World Order his dad
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.760]  wasn't more of a tyrant he's been probably ten times better than his dad
[14:11.760 --> 14:16.000]  the point is this is a war crime being committed by the West but we're run by
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.720]  the globalist and they have put al-qaeda in Libya they have now are trying to
[14:20.720 --> 14:24.160]  take over Syria and Syria is fighting back with the Russians and again the
[14:24.160 --> 14:27.840]  Russians are corrupt in their own way but they are not expanding worldwide
[14:27.840 --> 14:31.900]  they're not launching 30,000 drones worldwide and 30,000 domestically they
[14:31.900 --> 14:35.440]  want the next 10 years they're not putting cancer viruses in their vaccines
[14:35.440 --> 14:39.100]  they're paying people to have children in Russia because they openly say we
[14:39.100 --> 14:42.400]  were under eugenics under the Soviets it's even in Pravda that used to be
[14:42.400 --> 14:46.120]  known for lying that the New World Order is running things the communists were
[14:46.120 --> 14:50.560]  financed by Western banks to reduce our population the Russians at least part of
[14:50.560 --> 14:55.200]  the Russian hierarchy who's also corrupt understands the program and they're to
[14:55.200 --> 15:00.600]  be taken out as well but again I'm not again Israel's upon in this this is a
[15:00.600 --> 15:05.200]  master game ladies and gentlemen and here's some of the headlines Russia
[15:05.200 --> 15:09.560]  concerned with Israeli attack in Syria claiming chemical weapons we told you a
[15:09.560 --> 15:12.840]  year ago they try to claim they had chemical weapons that we're going to use
[15:12.840 --> 15:16.160]  them and they say rebels may get chemical weapons so we have to attack
[15:16.160 --> 15:20.200]  them when the rebels and this whole conflict were started by the West
[15:20.200 --> 15:23.660]  remember the first six months they called them peaceful protesters blowing
[15:23.660 --> 15:28.360]  up police stations I mean this is so immoral that's why they've had so many
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.880]  members of CENTCOM including the head of it being fired because they're not
[15:31.880 --> 15:37.200]  going along with this our government gave weapons to al-qaeda and made them
[15:37.200 --> 15:40.560]  the head of security in Benghazi they're the ones that killed the ambassador and
[15:40.560 --> 15:45.160]  then and and the Pentagon was told to stand down for eight hours and not send
[15:45.160 --> 15:49.040]  aid that was a mile down the street they had three drones overhead well one
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.840]  manned gunship two drones that was a stand down that was a that was a hit why
[15:53.840 --> 15:56.760]  why the White House wanted al-qaeda to kill the ambassador he was there
[15:56.760 --> 16:00.300]  reportedly transferring the missiles maybe they want to get rid of how
[16:00.300 --> 16:04.520]  al-qaeda is getting 10,000 heat seekers because when the al-qaeda blows up jet
[16:04.520 --> 16:08.160]  airliners folks in Europe and here and all and it's already started in the
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.600]  Middle East when they start shooting down jet airliners they're gonna have TSA
[16:12.600 --> 16:16.760]  on the street and when the TSA wants to search my car I'm gonna say you are part
[16:16.760 --> 16:20.200]  of the terrorists that armed al-qaeda you will not search my car I want to
[16:20.200 --> 16:24.600]  search you I'm not playing this game anymore
[16:24.600 --> 16:29.640]  Syria Iran's written consequences for Israeli strike there's that report
[16:29.640 --> 16:35.800]  Jerusalem Post Israeli jets blast arms shipment inside Syria the West is now
[16:35.800 --> 16:41.320]  commandeering passenger planes flying into Syria beating up men women and
[16:41.320 --> 16:48.240]  children on board u.s. Israel must withdraw from Judea and Samaria that's
[16:48.240 --> 16:53.120]  another headline Israel attacks strange bedfellows on Syria LCR blog wise
[16:53.120 --> 16:58.000]  Israel funding al-qaeda now Russia slams Israeli attack on Syria u.s. forces in
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.520]  Jordan on alert debkah file Israel attack desperate bid to save failed
[17:03.520 --> 17:10.560]  Syrian campaign yeah they want to get Iran and Syria to respond so they have a
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.320]  preemie this is so incredible we I take you now to London and Paul Joseph Watson
[17:15.320 --> 17:20.000]  who but with us this segment the next Paul you have been on top of this on top
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.480]  in the last week saying there's gonna be a stage chemical weapon strike now it's
[17:23.480 --> 17:26.840]  all happening what's happening Paul Watson
[17:26.840 --> 17:32.240]  well good to be back Alex yeah there's still debate and argument about what
[17:32.240 --> 17:38.080]  exactly the target of this Israeli air strike was because the Western media is
[17:38.080 --> 17:43.720]  saying that it was this arms convoy that was traveling from Syria into Lebanon
[17:43.720 --> 17:49.120]  for Hezbollah but the Syrians are saying that the actual target that was hit was
[17:49.120 --> 17:55.560]  a weapons facility in a place called Jamraiya I'm not sure about the
[17:55.560 --> 17:59.040]  pronunciation Debkah file that's basically Mossad is saying the same
[17:59.040 --> 18:04.120]  thing but the two targets are far away from each other the web the supposed
[18:04.120 --> 18:08.400]  weapons shipment was on the Lebanon border whereas Jamraiya is near
[18:08.400 --> 18:14.680]  Damascus so it's a completely different geographical area so Israel hasn't even
[18:14.680 --> 18:19.360]  admitted that they've committed any kind of air strike so far it's multiple saying
[18:19.360 --> 18:24.520]  that it was a weapons facility and that it turns out that this facility is
[18:24.520 --> 18:31.320]  engaged in long-range missile research so it looks like the Israelis have just
[18:31.320 --> 18:38.720]  used an excuse created this lie about weapon shipments to target a facility
[18:38.720 --> 18:43.520]  which was engaged in this cutting-edge research which might have been used to
[18:43.520 --> 18:47.280]  target Israel at some point in the future and bottom line we have the
[18:47.280 --> 18:53.120]  spectacle of 23 month attack by the West with al-qaeda and now even the LCR blog
[18:53.120 --> 18:57.560]  the libertarians are saying why is Israel helping al-qaeda well it's
[18:57.560 --> 19:01.280]  amazing isn't it because we had this story come out a couple of hours ago
[19:01.280 --> 19:06.560]  Syria may respond to Israeli air strike says ambassador and everybody's freaking
[19:06.560 --> 19:11.520]  out because they might defend themselves they might fight back so I I put the
[19:11.520 --> 19:16.480]  comment out you know imagine if Syrian fighter jets attacked targets inside
[19:16.480 --> 19:22.400]  Israel there'd be instant international condemnation be nuclear warm yeah I mean
[19:22.400 --> 19:26.920]  Obama couldn't send the f-16s to bomb Syria quick enough cutting no they knew
[19:26.920 --> 19:31.840]  come they'd nuke them yeah but Israel targets Syria complete violation of
[19:31.840 --> 19:35.640]  their sovereignty and hardly anyone bats an eyelid and it's just like oh yeah
[19:35.640 --> 19:41.080]  that's par for the and Syria took it and the media is like how dare you you we
[19:41.080 --> 19:46.760]  bombed you you that's violent what you did I mean it's just la la land level
[19:46.760 --> 19:51.840]  la la land stay there I want to get in when we come back to this report you put
[19:51.840 --> 19:56.440]  out that got picked up all over the world concerning this and now admitted

[24:17.560 --> 24:21.680]  all right we're back live Alex Jones here Paul Watson joining us from London
[24:21.680 --> 24:27.080]  Paul you did a story what was it on Tuesday was it Monday well break that
[24:27.080 --> 24:30.400]  down they got picked up by a bunch of British newspapers like the Daily Mail
[24:30.400 --> 24:35.320]  they didn't do a retraction they just pulled the whole article what yesterday
[24:35.320 --> 24:39.440]  when the British defense contractor that you contacted on Monday you know for
[24:39.440 --> 24:45.760]  comment finally responded but to the Russian national news saying look we did
[24:45.760 --> 24:50.040]  get hacked the thousands of pages of documents scans of passports that's why
[24:50.040 --> 24:53.360]  we said it looked like a real hack but we pointed out could be that somebody
[24:53.360 --> 24:57.520]  inserted fake stuff into the hack they're saying the emails where they're
[24:57.520 --> 25:01.000]  discussing a staged chemical event which has been discussed by the news
[25:01.000 --> 25:09.040]  everywhere that they were contacted by Qatar to be part of this and that they
[25:09.040 --> 25:14.160]  had said no we don't want to be part of it now again sounds like something the
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.720]  Russians would do hack it then add BS to it or it could be real Paul Watson
[25:19.720 --> 25:23.960]  describe what was in there the plan to stage a chemical attack and then blame
[25:23.960 --> 25:28.320]  it on the Syrians because that fits into everything we saw lining up this week
[25:28.320 --> 25:34.920]  well I mean for months we've been tracking this plan to stage a false
[25:34.920 --> 25:40.440]  humanitarian crisis the chemical weapons attack because Obama you know Francois
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.720]  Holland all the NATO people have made it clear on several occasions that that is
[25:44.720 --> 25:50.040]  quote their red line on direct military intervention in Syria so that's all they
[25:50.040 --> 25:55.960]  need to justify it in their eyes so we were tracking it for six to eight months
[25:55.960 --> 26:00.480]  before this all came out and then at the end of this last week it was a German
[26:00.480 --> 26:06.720]  hacker that hacked into Britam defense which is basically a defense contractor
[26:06.720 --> 26:12.760]  in their denial that these emails were real they claimed they were merely a
[26:12.760 --> 26:18.120]  commercial outfit well if they've got information about their activities in
[26:18.120 --> 26:21.960]  Iran and that was only commercial and that would be illegal because it's
[26:21.960 --> 26:26.200]  illegal to do business in Iran they've got mercenaries in Iraq they work
[26:26.200 --> 26:30.720]  directly with British Special Forces so their claim that they're only a
[26:30.720 --> 26:38.440]  commercial company that advises people smacks of dishonesty is to my mind but
[26:38.440 --> 26:43.920]  yeah they left it simmering for days this email communication supposedly
[26:43.920 --> 26:48.160]  between the founder and the business director of this Britam defense
[26:48.160 --> 26:54.080]  organization which talked about the Qataris proposing a deal which was quote
[26:54.080 --> 26:59.200]  approved by Washington to basically deliver a chemical weapon to Syria that
[26:59.200 --> 27:04.400]  was similar to the ones that Assad has and the implication was obviously to
[27:04.400 --> 27:08.320]  blame it on the Assad government so they came out they let it simmer for days
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.400]  they came out yesterday to voice of Russia because it was a big story in
[27:12.400 --> 27:17.480]  Russia and said basically yes we were hacked these these all these documents
[27:17.480 --> 27:22.480]  PDF files Word documents scans of passports they're all true but these
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.640]  emails are false they're hoaxes and it is a potential that they are hoaxes
[27:27.640 --> 27:31.960]  because the time stamps on two of the emails are the same the dates are
[27:31.960 --> 27:35.440]  different but the time stamps are exactly the same which leads you to
[27:35.440 --> 27:39.800]  wonder why would a hacker go to all that trouble and then leave the time stamps
[27:39.800 --> 27:44.120]  the same and leave a red herring for people to later discover that it was a
[27:44.120 --> 27:49.480]  hoax so whether it was the hack was not a hoax it was genuine and there's a lot
[27:49.480 --> 27:54.760]  of documents in there but they're saying now that the emails were a hoax and
[27:54.760 --> 27:58.360]  that's probably why the Daily Mail pulled it but as you said they should
[27:58.360 --> 28:02.960]  have just issued a retraction I mean we added to our story that denial by
[28:02.960 --> 28:08.400]  Britam that the emails were real but it's you know it's very interesting
[28:08.400 --> 28:16.680]  Paul I mean this is this is so over-the-top I don't have words to
[28:16.680 --> 28:22.000]  describe how insane it is to have the whole world including Israel ganging up
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.360]  on Syria who's done nothing to to to massacre Christians and Muslim
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.320]  minorities to put al-qaeda in and they've taken about a third of the
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.640]  country and shoot mass rally videos where they say we blew up your towers
[28:35.640 --> 28:40.160]  we're going to attack America after Syria and then the government you know
[28:40.160 --> 28:44.680]  stages Benghazi and kills the ambassador and I mean it's just what's coming next
[28:44.680 --> 28:50.260]  why is the government so mad dog arrogant I mean in the past they would
[28:50.260 --> 28:53.960]  try to cover stuff up like this what what is going on why are they so
[28:53.960 --> 28:59.400]  arrogant well because they know most people don't pay attention I mean when
[28:59.400 --> 29:03.160]  they came they're trying to differentiate the terrorists like al-nusrah
[29:03.160 --> 29:07.200]  the al-qaeda groups have killed us troops in Syria and the rebels like
[29:07.200 --> 29:12.520]  they're different organizations when as soon as the u.s. designated al-nusrah as
[29:12.520 --> 29:19.040]  a terrorist organization the 29 other Syrian rebel groups immediately came out
[29:19.040 --> 29:23.360]  and pledged their allegiance to al-nusrah so they were saying yes where
[29:23.360 --> 29:27.920]  with the terrorists then as the New York Times admits al-nusrah the terrorist
[29:27.920 --> 29:33.560]  group coordinates all the bombings leads all the rebel groups it's the commanding
[29:33.560 --> 29:37.880]  force in Syria so you can't differentiate it and say oh we need to
[29:37.880 --> 29:43.200]  go into Syria to get al-qaeda in support of the rebels because the rebels are
[29:43.200 --> 29:46.800]  al-qaeda they're all basically one group they've pledged allegiance to each other
[29:46.800 --> 29:49.880]  all right Paul stay there do five more minutes with us I want to see where you
[29:49.880 --> 29:56.240]  think this is going March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[33:32.480 --> 33:35.640]  openly have introduced bills at the state and federal level that are the
[33:35.640 --> 33:40.360]  main bills and in the Feinstein case where the government officials not
[33:40.360 --> 33:44.480]  servants are all exempt and can have whatever guns they want but we've got a
[33:44.480 --> 33:50.360]  register ours and turn them in of the ATF feels like it I mean just absolutely
[33:50.360 --> 33:54.880]  incredible and it doesn't really translate well on radio because it's
[33:54.880 --> 34:02.280]  visual but MSNBC has been caught again just like with Trayvon Martin and
[34:02.280 --> 34:07.560]  they're getting sued where George Zimmerman in the 9-1-1 call is like okay
[34:07.560 --> 34:11.540]  the guys looking around walking around by cars what's he look like looks like a
[34:11.540 --> 34:18.320]  teenager we've heard the tape he's wearing a hoodie he's walking around and
[34:18.320 --> 34:22.520]  they asked him well well well what color is he looks like he's black well they
[34:22.520 --> 34:26.560]  edited it to yeah there's a guy walking around looks like he's black and then
[34:26.560 --> 34:30.160]  went on and said looks like he's black can you believe the racism of this
[34:30.160 --> 34:35.200]  cracker they now say that all the time on MSNBC cracker Southerners are trash
[34:35.200 --> 34:40.440]  white people are bad and it's white people saying this Chris Matthews and
[34:40.440 --> 34:46.740]  Carlos Watson and that woman yesterday said it what's her name Finn Finney
[34:46.740 --> 34:51.200]  Finney yeah these crackers you know these old crackers and you even got
[34:51.200 --> 34:55.640]  Jindal you know the Republican governor going yeah these old white men are the
[34:55.640 --> 34:58.680]  problem I mean again you're like well wait a
[34:58.680 --> 35:02.240]  minute I mean whites have intermarried totally embraced political correctness
[35:02.240 --> 35:06.640]  you know agreed that we're the worst people on earth and now we're told we're
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.160]  the cause of all folks it's it's racial division the system wants racial
[35:11.160 --> 35:15.280]  division and so this will make white people very racist and very suspicious
[35:15.280 --> 35:17.520]  because they haven't been racist or suspicious
[35:17.520 --> 35:22.160]  believe me I'm white folks I know okay I grew up the supposed south okay whites
[35:22.160 --> 35:26.520]  totally bought the full guilt deal even though you know young whites had
[35:26.520 --> 35:29.080]  nothing to do with any of this stuff there's been all sorts of oppression
[35:29.080 --> 35:32.320]  throughout history they give a victim identity to the system they give a
[35:32.320 --> 35:36.920]  victim identity to to impoverish and control and manipulate quote minorities
[35:36.920 --> 35:40.000]  so they're under government control while their futures being destroyed
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.800]  whites are being destroyed we're all being destroyed by the New World Order
[35:42.800 --> 35:46.160]  we're all having our power prices increased we're all having our payroll
[35:46.160 --> 35:49.880]  taxes go up we're all having the Social Security money stolen we're all being
[35:49.880 --> 35:55.440]  screwed but meanwhile CNN and MSNBC are saying cracker white people Southerners
[35:55.440 --> 35:59.680]  well I'll sharp and we got to overcome the white Southerners I mean it is folks
[35:59.680 --> 36:03.640]  if white people talk like this it'll be the end of the world but now they go
[36:03.640 --> 36:07.280]  support gun control you're racist all right here's my guns support socialism
[36:07.280 --> 36:10.440]  and death panels you're racist all right support aborting black babies you're
[36:10.440 --> 36:13.900]  racist all right all right I supporters the money to kill them that's very
[36:13.900 --> 36:17.480]  liberal now that's right killing black people is pro-black saying you want to
[36:17.480 --> 36:22.800]  own guns is racist and you know and and the job of the hut Lego place that is
[36:22.800 --> 36:26.880]  racist we gotta ban it you're like that doesn't make any sense how does a green
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.560]  pig and a skeleton and I mean we actually own the toy set we even I even
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.560]  have it at the office I even owned it before this came out that it's racist
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.680]  and I just I look at it and can't again Hello Kitty bubble guns illegal or
[36:39.680 --> 36:44.340]  arrest people you're like doesn't make sense it makes perfect sense this is the
[36:44.340 --> 36:49.400]  authoritarianism where they have the moral high ground and then real racism
[36:49.400 --> 36:54.140]  real real discrimination as the mega banks get 47 trillion dollars of taxpayer
[36:54.140 --> 36:59.180]  money the last five years plus that's an old number and sign us on to 1.5 global
[36:59.180 --> 37:02.800]  quadrillion in fake derivatives oh no no that's discriminatory having our
[37:02.800 --> 37:06.400]  factories all shipped to China India and Mexico which doesn't even help those
[37:06.400 --> 37:09.760]  people because it's so horrible they're living in you know dormitories where
[37:09.760 --> 37:13.440]  they have forced abortions and suicide nets and hundred square feet per person
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.520]  I mean it is it is insane the Chinese sky is so toxic it catches on fire
[37:18.520 --> 37:22.680]  sometimes the rivers catch on fire they're having canned air we have the
[37:22.680 --> 37:27.440]  canned air clip people aren't gonna believe this okay I'm gonna go back to
[37:27.440 --> 37:31.720]  Paul Watson to finish up on the Syria issue but here it is China's filthy air
[37:31.720 --> 37:39.120]  prompts mask rush and sale of fresh air in cans ABC News I'm not joking for the
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.360]  fourth time this year a murky haze is descended over North China leaving
[37:43.360 --> 37:47.960]  residents of Beijing choking on toxic smog China's air hasn't been this bad
[37:47.960 --> 37:52.240]  since 1954 according to the state-run People's Daily because the winds have
[37:52.240 --> 37:57.600]  kind of slowed down the prevailing winds the trade winds and above those the well
[37:57.600 --> 38:01.040]  they're all prevailing winds but the the jet stream don't worry it's all coming
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.720]  to the US anyways for whatever weird reason we're bound to China and we get
[38:06.720 --> 38:10.200]  there of their smog the globalist smog but all there's no calls to clean that
[38:10.200 --> 38:14.280]  up the globalists are using them having no environmental standards to leverage
[38:14.280 --> 38:20.040]  out the West nobody can compete bankrupt everything oh I talked to Austinites
[38:20.040 --> 38:26.560]  every couple days I ran into a guy last night just getting gas where he's got a
[38:26.560 --> 38:32.440]  kombucha microbrew very popular I've actually heard of it well he's actually
[38:32.440 --> 38:37.360]  connected one of our graphics people that's how he knew me but and he's had
[38:37.360 --> 38:43.240]  to move out to Hays County because Austin would not let him would not let
[38:43.240 --> 38:50.400]  him I'm gonna say that again would not let him make kombucha in Austin that
[38:50.400 --> 38:53.360]  they just harassed him it's you can't build anything in Austin now unless
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.680]  you're an insider globalist we're the model of this whole country just like
[38:57.680 --> 39:00.320]  the Jersey coast nobody's allowed to rebuild but insiders are saying you
[39:00.320 --> 39:04.040]  can't rebuild Gen 21 sell your property off ten cents on the dollar to big guys
[39:04.040 --> 39:07.920]  if you want old family-owned little motels and hotels one of the most
[39:07.920 --> 39:11.520]  popular destinations on the East Coast very beautiful Jersey Coast one of the
[39:11.520 --> 39:14.640]  best things about you know New Jersey that people run down and talk bad about
[39:14.640 --> 39:18.120]  all day Jersey Coast pretty nice you know they got shows about it making fun
[39:18.120 --> 39:24.960]  of it but the point is is that you can't operate Ted Anderson moved out of
[39:24.960 --> 39:28.400]  Minneapolis because of the code enforces harassing him I mean it's a radio
[39:28.400 --> 39:33.920]  network and it's guys on the phone you know brokers selling gold and silver so
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.240]  he moved to st. Paul they harassed him out of there I mean every time I talked
[39:38.240 --> 39:41.440]  to Ted he's got some state agency in his office he says it's not just me
[39:41.440 --> 39:44.560]  Minnesota's one of the worst he says it's everybody then he bought this big
[39:44.560 --> 39:47.760]  house that had been up for sale for years that nobody could get near an
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.880]  industrial park and they said don't worry we're gonna give you the permits
[39:51.880 --> 39:55.320]  for this to be a business go ahead and move in he buys it he fights him for
[39:55.320 --> 39:58.920]  four years they harassing they should basically shut him down he moves now
[39:58.920 --> 40:04.680]  they're saying we're not gonna stop you can't have a business we're not gonna
[40:04.680 --> 40:07.600]  let you sell it as a house or a business he was what do I do with this big giant
[40:07.600 --> 40:12.880]  house you know before I had an office park they go hey do whatever you want
[40:12.880 --> 40:18.040]  and actually laugh at him they want to destroy us they've been given the orders
[40:18.040 --> 40:23.740]  you understand it's called agenda 21 it's in other big sociological papers
[40:23.740 --> 40:28.720]  we've broken down for 15 years bankrupting us is the goal it is the
[40:28.720 --> 40:33.360]  goal they don't want tourism they want nothing I was reading the other day I
[40:33.360 --> 40:36.160]  was told about it a year ago by Michael's whirling that owns two stations
[40:36.160 --> 40:41.200]  were on out in California MZ but then I actually saw it in the news where Noah
[40:41.200 --> 40:46.280]  the Weather Service has now got guns and they go out and arrest surfers if they
[40:46.280 --> 40:51.600]  get within 50 yards of a whale or a or a or a seal or anything and they're like
[40:51.600 --> 40:55.200]  wait tourists are coming here to surf they're like we're arresting everybody
[40:55.200 --> 41:01.040]  they just don't arrest dozens of people every day right off the you know coast
[41:01.040 --> 41:07.000]  right there in the area that he's in I'm just ranting it's just a total
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.400]  takeover okay I mean I'm down there at Big Bend watching illegal aliens go back
[41:12.400 --> 41:15.640]  and forth all day and ride horses on both sides border patrol does nothing
[41:15.640 --> 41:18.800]  they're ordered to stand down and I watched the park Rangers who most I'd
[41:18.800 --> 41:22.080]  say hi to him and they would literally not talk to me I shot a video about this
[41:22.080 --> 41:28.000]  one guy I said hi and he goes he was like a big huge guy he actually went
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.960]  like Hulk Hogan and then I ran into other people who said man we ran into
[41:31.960 --> 41:35.760]  this this guy and I describe they go yeah that's him and they go yeah he you
[41:35.760 --> 41:41.520]  know we talked to him and he went so imagine hey I do it and then I'm down
[41:41.520 --> 41:46.120]  there at the hot springs I'm going back to Watson right on the the Rio Grande
[41:46.120 --> 41:48.840]  watching the illegals go back and forth we have video this we're finally gonna
[41:48.840 --> 41:51.440]  premiere on the nightly news tonight just we've been so overwhelmed with more
[41:51.440 --> 41:55.280]  hardcore news and we've got people on horseback riding back and forth broad
[41:55.280 --> 42:00.520]  daylight and the border patrol is there with the park Rangers I'm sitting there
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.480]  in the natural hot tub by the Rio Grande just absolutely gorgeous and I feel
[42:04.480 --> 42:07.200]  somebody looking at me and I look up there's about 15 people in this big hot
[42:07.200 --> 42:11.760]  tub and there's a there's a park ranger staring right at me like he wants to
[42:11.760 --> 42:17.880]  kill me and I wasn't drinking we're gonna go on another hike after this we
[42:17.880 --> 42:20.880]  just been on a long one like a I don't know four miles of a mountain and back
[42:20.880 --> 42:26.520]  down and I'm sitting there and he's looking at me and I go why is he looking
[42:26.520 --> 42:30.600]  at me I look over and there's a curves light sitting next to me and a woman in
[42:30.600 --> 42:33.920]  a red bikini sitting right next to me and he's looking at me like it's mine
[42:33.920 --> 42:40.360]  and I just knew what he's looking at I went you know the universal thing of my
[42:40.360 --> 42:44.000]  hands like that's not mine and I said to the guys that we got to get out of here
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.840]  they're about to raid all these people and they said oh no they're not it was
[42:47.840 --> 42:52.280]  like a bunch of UT lawyer alumni like 40 year old guys out there and with their
[42:52.280 --> 42:55.400]  girlfriends and and they're throwing a football back and forth they're having a
[42:55.400 --> 42:58.520]  couple beers and there's a little bitty sound when you drive into that area
[42:58.520 --> 43:04.160]  saying alcohol is not not permitted here a little bitty sound on the entrance
[43:04.160 --> 43:07.120]  the run us we got to gather I'll call you're being paranoid Rob do and my dad
[43:07.120 --> 43:11.240]  and others who were with us you're being paranoid and I said no get the stuff I'm
[43:11.240 --> 43:14.600]  getting out of here I go they now arrest people who haven't even been drinking
[43:14.600 --> 43:18.320]  I'm got no to get out of here they want to stay 15 more minutes and I didn't
[43:18.320 --> 43:21.840]  get video this because I had a gut feeling we were gonna get arrested so
[43:21.840 --> 43:25.320]  we're pulling out all sudden Border Patrol shoots in for the parking lot at
[43:25.320 --> 43:30.240]  the hot springs there this is how crazy this country is I'm thinking oh my gosh
[43:30.240 --> 43:33.440]  they do something about all the illegals you're right there coming them back and
[43:33.440 --> 43:37.440]  forth across the border this romantic setting and they start putting body
[43:37.440 --> 43:45.040]  armor on and then two two more park Rangers but the cop type pull up and
[43:45.040 --> 43:48.640]  they're getting armor on and I walk over through a water bottle away in the trash
[43:48.640 --> 43:55.560]  the recycler they go hey how's it going on what's going on and I'm okay and then
[43:55.560 --> 43:58.040]  I hear him talking the guard I got my tickets ready you're gonna back me up
[43:58.040 --> 44:01.320]  they're like yeah we're ready to back you up and they proceeded and again I
[44:01.320 --> 44:04.840]  was on my vacation I'm usually I would have done something I just I can't handle
[44:04.840 --> 44:07.560]  this anymore I'm like let's get out of here news like I'm getting the GoPro out
[44:07.560 --> 44:10.640]  I mean I brought a camera we'll tape it I'm like no I just can't handle it we
[44:10.640 --> 44:14.280]  got some of it I just can't handle it anymore man you can't go anywhere and by
[44:14.280 --> 44:17.200]  the way there were illegals just crossing I talked to locals I said at
[44:17.200 --> 44:20.440]  night hundreds come across there and get picked up by localities the Border
[44:20.440 --> 44:24.600]  Patrol is obviously all paid off that's come out on record the citizens are the
[44:24.600 --> 44:29.760]  target you know the government's arming al-qaeda but UT alumni guys can't have a
[44:29.760 --> 44:33.600]  couple beers on the Rio Grande while felonies are being committed all around
[44:33.600 --> 44:36.920]  them and they had big things of tickets rubber hand you know the plastic
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.480]  handcuffs on their side and and and then we're driving out and more more Border
[44:41.480 --> 44:46.600]  Patrol more guards more park rangers are pulling down the little road you know
[44:46.600 --> 44:49.880]  the dead ends by the hot springs is like how did you know that I said I saw the
[44:49.880 --> 44:54.000]  look in his eye man he wasn't about to give tickets the guys too scared he
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.200]  wasn't about to give tickets to 15 people these guys see us as the enemy
[44:58.200 --> 45:02.000]  he's not worried about the coyotes going back and forth literally 20 feet from
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.080]  him I said they're gonna arrest these people
[45:06.080 --> 45:09.400]  and later I ran into a woman at the lodge that night he said there were a
[45:09.400 --> 45:13.000]  bunch of tickets being given out one guy was being put in handcuffs I just can't
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.520]  handle it anymore man I can't even go down and just be at a national park I am
[45:17.520 --> 45:23.840]  the prey I am the food I am the food and I knew I said we're food let's get out
[45:23.840 --> 45:28.280]  of here I mean I can't handle it anymore I'm sorry Watson I've had John hold
[45:28.280 --> 45:33.800]  finish up with Syria then I'll get into all the other news it's it's it's just
[45:33.800 --> 45:41.800]  getting so bad oh I meant to play this China's filthy air prompts sales of
[45:41.800 --> 45:45.920]  fresh air cans I mean I guess they got the idea from space balls let's play
[45:45.920 --> 45:50.800]  that clip and go to Watson here it is planet space ball I can assure both you
[45:50.800 --> 45:56.680]  and your viewers that there's absolutely no air shortage whatsoever yes of course
[45:56.680 --> 46:01.640]  I've heard the same rumor myself yes thanks for calling and not reversing the
[46:01.640 --> 46:09.560]  charges yeah bye oops I wanted to bleep that guys I said check it let's bleep
[46:09.560 --> 46:20.640]  that we bleep that John it's a 40-second clip only various huffing out of a
[46:20.640 --> 46:25.320]  Perrier air can okay there goes the clip we had to bleep part of it as I forgot
[46:25.320 --> 46:29.600]  there was a cuss word in it okay there you go from space balls Paul Watson
[46:29.600 --> 46:34.340]  going back to you my friend you finish up with the whole serious situation where
[46:34.340 --> 46:39.080]  do you see it going where I mean they may start nuking Syria and and you know
[46:39.080 --> 46:41.680]  the videos come out of them cutting Christians heads off and our media is
[46:41.680 --> 46:47.280]  like the New York Times even praised the al-qaeda rebels and then the public
[46:47.280 --> 46:50.820]  said boy but those are al-qaeda killing and blowing up churches and the New York
[46:50.820 --> 46:54.320]  Times pulled the video I mean I guess they really want to sell us on this I
[46:54.320 --> 46:57.640]  guess they think the public are total jellyfish Paul where do you see this
[46:57.640 --> 47:04.200]  going well they'll end up giving those rebel commanders you know refugee status
[47:04.200 --> 47:09.120]  in the United States like they did with Iraqis Iraqi terrorists after Gulf War
[47:09.120 --> 47:14.120]  one that helped the United States and as he said they'll then start attacking the
[47:14.120 --> 47:18.640]  United States and it'll be all forgotten that the United States created arms
[47:18.640 --> 47:22.800]  funded them in the first place but there's a headline Syrian rebels steal
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.120]  credit from Israel for attack now they're claiming that they hit the
[47:27.120 --> 47:31.800]  weapons convoy so it looks like there could have been two separate attacks but
[47:31.800 --> 47:36.720]  far as where it you know where's where's it going they've said that Assad's fall
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.920]  is imminent about three times that the rebels are closing in on Damascus I've
[47:41.920 --> 47:46.840]  literally heard that three or four times within the last year never happens now
[47:46.840 --> 47:50.840]  it looks like it's a stalemate you know the country's completely destroyed
[47:50.840 --> 47:56.320]  they've got thousands of refugees streaming out into Jordan but the
[47:56.320 --> 48:00.840]  difference between Libya and Syria is that you know Libya had a 15,000 man
[48:00.840 --> 48:06.920]  army Syria's got something like 150,000 ten times the amount Syria's got an air
[48:06.920 --> 48:13.160]  defense system which Libya basically had no air defense system but if this
[48:13.160 --> 48:17.440]  actually happened this incident today and Israel's flown a fighter jet all the
[48:17.440 --> 48:23.120]  way nearly to Damascus and bombed a weapons facility then how good a Syria's
[48:23.120 --> 48:26.880]  air defense is not very good if you know they can penetrate them with no
[48:26.880 --> 48:32.120]  resistance whatsoever so that might be a test case for the pro bomber now to
[48:32.120 --> 48:36.200]  send in the drones and for the fun to begin because obviously that was their
[48:36.200 --> 48:39.760]  main concern that Syria's air defenses would be too strong and they will
[48:39.760 --> 48:44.800]  actually get on the news and say how dare the Syrians not nuke themselves I
[48:44.800 --> 48:48.120]  mean if the Syrians don't March all their kids out to al-qaeda and chop
[48:48.120 --> 48:52.120]  their heads off their bad I mean how immoral has the West become that they're
[48:52.120 --> 48:57.000]  doing this publicly Paul what do you predict coming I think as the Brookings
[48:57.000 --> 49:02.120]  Institution report from March 2012 said the perfect opportunity for them would
[49:02.120 --> 49:06.680]  be a massive humanitarian crisis which is already happening but I think they're
[49:06.680 --> 49:09.680]  going to stage some big event they've already said they're going to do it
[49:09.680 --> 49:14.400]  whether it be chemical weapons you know babies thrown out of incubators or
[49:14.400 --> 49:18.360]  whatever some fake prison camp like a fake Serbian death camp that ever
[49:18.360 --> 49:22.760]  existed they'll try and fake another stage humanitarian crisis and that will
[49:22.760 --> 49:30.240]  be presented as the final straw and then the fun will begin incredible
[49:30.240 --> 49:34.440]  incredible you heard me rant about all the stuff that's happening it's not even
[49:34.440 --> 49:38.560]  the tip of the iceberg Homeland Security is officially saying everyone should
[49:38.560 --> 49:43.440]  have scissors in their office or school in case there's a mass shooter that
[49:43.440 --> 49:46.760]  that's been officially put out on recovering that I mean it's just they're
[49:46.760 --> 49:51.120]  they're they're SWAT teaming and expelling people for Hello Kitty bubble
[49:51.120 --> 49:57.360]  projectors paper guns Legos I mean it's we're going and the same thing in
[49:57.360 --> 50:01.680]  England you're under the same mind control system I mean they just how much
[50:01.680 --> 50:06.960]  crazier will it get I guess a lot crazier well the problem is that a lot
[50:06.960 --> 50:11.520]  of people have been driven crazy by a lot of this and they can't differentiate
[50:11.520 --> 50:15.440]  between fact and fiction but what's really happening is while the
[50:15.440 --> 50:18.480]  Department of Homeland Security is doing that and saying protect yourself with
[50:18.480 --> 50:23.280]  scissors they've just bought 7,000 fully automatic assault rifles they've bought
[50:23.280 --> 50:29.400]  over 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition so they're building you know detention
[50:29.400 --> 50:33.040]  camps in Georgia and places like that I saw another report just the other day
[50:33.040 --> 50:36.360]  they're training for confiscating guns is down the army manual and it's like
[50:36.360 --> 50:41.520]  hey giant guys in Darth Vader outfits huge armored command bases checkpoints
[50:41.520 --> 50:46.200]  everywhere totally safe Hello Kitty bubble projector in the hands of an
[50:46.200 --> 50:49.920]  evil five-year-old everybody run in fear I mean they're they're creating a
[50:49.920 --> 50:54.680]  responsive Oh a citizen with a bubble oh I got a Darth Vader you know classic

[51:03.140 --> 51:07.720]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[51:07.720 --> 51:11.760]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar
[51:11.760 --> 51:15.640]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[51:15.640 --> 51:19.680]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[51:19.680 --> 51:24.080]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[51:24.080 --> 51:28.280]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[51:28.280 --> 51:32.060]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[51:32.060 --> 51:35.720]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[51:35.720 --> 51:40.080]  related images number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[51:40.080 --> 51:43.200]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[55:42.760 --> 55:48.520]  been doing this 17 years adding the video and things for about 10 and of
[55:48.520 --> 55:51.080]  course it's now being duplicated by everyone else which I think is a good
[55:51.080 --> 55:56.960]  thing it's good to show people what you got show people the facts so I think

[56:26.360 --> 56:29.960]  work into at many levels it's much better than even the radio show that's
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.320]  why we're playing a lot of the produced pieces here and we come back from break
[56:33.320 --> 56:36.400]  in that little no-man's land the first five minutes that some stations carry
[56:36.400 --> 56:39.520]  some don't we're gonna change our clock soon where we don't have that and come
[56:39.520 --> 56:44.480]  out at 6 after but the point is we're gonna hear Aaron Dykes's report on MSNBC
[56:44.480 --> 56:49.520]  hoax gun advocates heckled Sandy Hook father and they ran this clip all over
[56:49.520 --> 56:55.480]  the news MSNBC put the hoax out a bunch of other TV networks picked it up all
[56:55.480 --> 57:00.160]  the Democratic Party organs picked it up saying look at these fathers you know
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.780]  this poor father lost his child he said you know and then look for no reason
[57:03.780 --> 57:07.540]  they laugh and heckle at him and say shall not be infringed just out of the
[57:07.540 --> 57:11.380]  blue they interrupt him the father really says can any of you tell me why
[57:11.380 --> 57:15.680]  we need semi-auto can you and everybody's quiet people go oh yeah a
[57:15.680 --> 57:20.160]  Second Amendment you know right keep their arms shall not be infringed well
[57:20.160 --> 57:25.920]  they just cut the question out and MSNBC delays their feeds about 15 seconds
[57:25.920 --> 57:30.600]  we've been watching this most TV doesn't do that so they acted like the feed cut
[57:30.600 --> 57:34.600]  for a minute and then ran with it and even after it came out they said oh no
[57:34.600 --> 57:38.120]  we're defending it no no that's what he said just like they got caught in Trayvon
[57:38.120 --> 57:41.880]  Martin editing the tape to have him go yeah it's a guy with a hoodie it's a
[57:41.880 --> 57:46.920]  black guy they're like what color is the person it looks like he black again
[57:46.920 --> 57:51.080]  they're being sued over that this is what they think of you this is what they
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.800]  think about you I mean it I make mistakes sometimes I get up on air and
[57:55.800 --> 58:00.520]  flip a number or say a name wrong and I you know hear it later and I'm like oh
[58:00.520 --> 58:04.800]  no it wasn't Thomas Jefferson said that it was Benjamin Franklin but most people
[58:04.800 --> 58:08.360]  don't even catch my mistakes and I make them I hear him I can't stand it but
[58:08.360 --> 58:11.440]  when you're up here without teleprompters it happens imagine
[58:11.440 --> 58:16.020]  consciously editing feeds sitting there watching and this is the stuff we're
[58:16.020 --> 58:21.080]  catching and then meanwhile going yeah gun owners are crackers white people
[58:21.080 --> 58:25.840]  saying that in Al Sharpton yeah we got to overcome the south and whites yeah
[58:25.840 --> 58:30.360]  everybody owns guns as a clan and a Nazi CBS News Bob Shafer yeah we defeated the
[58:30.360 --> 58:34.160]  Nazis will defeat gun owners I mean this is an open occupation force they're
[58:34.160 --> 58:37.920]  obviously the enemy these are evil people ladies and gentlemen and what

[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:10.360]  Aaron Dykes here for info Wars calm now we've seen already how the gun grabbers
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:14.520]  will stop at almost nothing to advance their agenda as long as they get to rain
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:18.240]  in the Second Amendment right because the fact that individuals have rights is
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.600]  very threatening to any authoritarian government whatever its stripes
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:26.360]  political stances or colors but the latest hoax we saw on MSNBC is just
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.240]  incredible they went out of their way to distort gun owners and advocates of the
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.560]  Second Amendment right who were in testimony Monday with the parents of the
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.000]  Sandy Hook victims and MSNBC deliberately edited testimony of Neil
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.280]  Heslin the father of Jesse Lewis as he advocated restricting assault rifles
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:50.560]  banning high-capacity clips which is fine you can understand his grief why he
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.920]  would speak out on that even though I think it's a misguided position I
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.800]  certainly sympathize with the families who lost children with anyone who's lost
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.800]  children or family members in a tragedy but what's not okay is the way that
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.400]  Martin Bashir Lawrence O'Donnell and other figures on MSNBC blogs across the
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.360]  internet went with the hoax on purpose where Neil Heslin in the middle of his
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.760]  testimony asked the rhetorical question who of you in this room can answer this
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.560]  question why does anyone in this room need to have an assault rifle or a high
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:28.040]  capacity clip and he waits a few seconds there's silence and he says no one can
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.280]  answer that question in this room and so a number of gun rights advocates who
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.000]  were there at the hearing spoke up saying that you shall not infringe on
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.920]  the Second Amendment I asked there's anybody in this room that can give me
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:48.480]  one reason or challenge this question why anybody in this room needs to have
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.920]  an assault one of these assault-style weapons or military weapons or high
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.960]  capacity clips
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.600]  now one person can answer that question
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:13.680]  all right and what they did was edited this part of the testimony edited out
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.520]  the part where the father asked the question and just made it look like
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.480]  people were interrupting this father's testimony who had just had children die
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.600]  and Sandy Hook and obviously it's very sympathetic moment they were all
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.040]  entitled to our own opinion and I respect their their opinions and their
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:37.760]  thoughts but I wish they'd respect mine and give it a little bit of thought a
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.840]  father's grief interrupted by the cries of a heckler that was the scene today in
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.960]  Hartford Connecticut where the parents of children killed at Sandy Hook
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.920]  Elementary testified before an audience that wasn't always friendly deliberately
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:55.440]  distorted just like they deliberately out edited the audio of the Trayvon
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.400]  Martin shooting to make it seem like it was racially motivated when in fact it
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.420]  turned out that Zimmerman had often worked with the black community he
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:07.160]  himself was a mixed race and really race shouldn't have been the main issue of
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.840]  that certainly it's legitimate to question if his death was justified we
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.180]  get that MSNBC is state-run propaganda for the Obama administration just as Fox
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:22.200]  News was blatantly state propaganda during the George W Bush years and the
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.800]  next time they roll out of president maybe they'll switch networks again or
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:30.100]  maybe MSNBC will continue on its current track I get it what do you expect from a
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.800]  pig but a grunt but what I don't understand is why they always paint
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.960]  anyone who asks questions anyone who stands up for rights anyone who says
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.720]  that we're being delivered hoaxes in the media to push an agenda why those people
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.680]  are blamed and why they always say how dare you ask those questions or defend
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.600]  those rights because of the families who have victims from this tragedy why don't
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.160]  any of the parents from these tragedies whether it's 9-11 or Sandy Hook or any
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.000]  of the Colorado shooting anything why don't they get mad at the establishment
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.120]  using their tragedy to advance the establishment's agenda it's very clear
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.200]  we know that Feinstein was pursuing the assault weapons ban before the Sandy
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.740]  Hook shooting it's very clear that Rahm Emanuel said their policy that the
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:20.520]  Obama administration's policy is to use crises don't let a good crisis go to
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:25.280]  waste you never want a serious crisis to go to waste and what I mean by that it's
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.760]  an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do but we know that
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.960]  the Patriot Act was written beforehand and on the books and the ocean
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.580]  administration was looking for the excuse to get it put into law we know
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.800]  that the project for a new American century wanted a Pearl Harbor style
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:45.120]  attack to advance an American Empire agenda a multi-theater war overseas we
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.680]  know they have agendas they announced them they've been uncovered found by
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.040]  researchers but they always say how dare the researchers question how dare you
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.760]  question those in power who admittedly are just seeking more power and will use
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:03.680]  any tragedy to find it Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.640]  the prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.280]  the globalist model is to shut down societies and starve Patriots out until
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.360]  they acquiesce to the global takeover that's why we've assembled the most

[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:49.360]  last day of January 2013 already about to go into the second month of 2013 hard
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:52.880]  to believe 2012 went by in the twinkling of an eye this year is moving even
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.480]  faster okay coming up at the bottom of the hour the latest on Israeli strikes
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:03.320]  inside Syria and even the libertarian party is officially asking why is Israel
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:08.200]  now backing al-qaeda rebels why is America backing al-qaeda rebels we now
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.760]  know why the head of CENTCOM has been relieved and so many other top generals
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.520]  they're not going along with this they have been voicing their concerns like
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.800]  retired head of Special Forces general Boykin and others and that is the good
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:30.320]  news up at info wars dot-com over 1,000 green berets sign letter supporting
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.440]  Second Amendment and on the big special forces website that were linked to where
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:42.960]  they did this this public letter to Obama a professional soldiers calm they
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:48.320]  actually quote me you know it says Hitler took the gun Stalin took the guns
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:52.440]  mal took the guns this is what tyrants do we're going into tyranny and they
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.960]  basically talk about how our military is now being set up to be used against us
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.280]  they're having drills all over the country to acclimate the troops the
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.000]  police and the citizens for occupation it's in the new army manuals that they
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.400]  want to use the military against the American people in there they said this
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.920]  Monday at the law enforcement conference that big sis ran that the new threat is
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.440]  not al-qaeda it is the gun owner the libertarian the conservative the
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:20.880]  returning veteran and the quote radical extremists the malicious so they're
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.420]  announcing you know this whole homeland security thing it's set up for people
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:29.720]  that don't like the new world order oh I told you that many years ago but now
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.960]  this is public information let's go over some of the other Second Amendment news
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.520]  is out of the New York Post when I saw this actually went and looked it up and
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:46.040]  homeland security actually says said this homeland security has made just one
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.320]  of the most ridiculous statements ever by these people homeland security has
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:55.320]  advice for confronting mass murderers scissors is your workplace getting
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.120]  shown up by a crazed gunman no problem just grab a pair of scissors and fight
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:04.640]  back that's some of the helpful advice in a new and structural video from the
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.720]  Department of Homeland Security that was posted on the agency's website just a
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.440]  month after the massacre at Sandy Hook School in Connecticut yeah they had a
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:18.120]  similar video last year that we covered where you know it said fight back
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.040]  physically well how about with guns if you were caught this is a quote from the
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:26.920]  video videos up at info Wars calm if you were caught out in the open and cannot
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.000]  conceal yourself or take cover you might consider trying to overpower the shooter
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.280]  with whatever means are available
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:48.480]  says the narrator in the video which shows an office worker pulling scissors
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.640]  out of the desk drawer we're gonna show you and play the audio of that video
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.760]  coming up here in just a little while but again it's up at in fall Wars calm
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.520]  and the New York Post has done a report on this here's some of the other
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.520]  headlines we're going to Larry Pratt who just joined us the head of gun owners of
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:10.320]  America the chairman Arizona Senate panel passes bill barring
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.200]  enforcement of federal gun measures so some some good news Wyoming House
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.480]  approves bills exempting state from federal gun control measures yeah the
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.720]  state's getting legally let illegal aliens run around above the law how about
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.440]  they just let the Constitution stay in place and actually follow their oath see
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.040]  the oath means null and void stuff that's unconstitutional probably have
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.420]  juries to to judge the facts as well as the law doesn't matter if the judge says
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:39.880]  the law says this put them in jail I order you that judge is a tyrant fraud
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:46.640]  in a black robe here's another one Super Bowl fans to face mandatory TSA pat
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.720]  downs which they've got those going on in Austin now on South Lamar you're not

[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:02.920]  killed 2,450 percent more Americans than all gun related deaths combined great
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:08.320]  article by Mike Adams from natural news calm up at prison planet calm right now
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:13.600]  and again vast majority of gun owners would defy ban poll shows yeah new
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.120]  workers are going public and I'm not turning my guns and gun shop owners are
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.920]  going public they're going public people say don't go public the why they'll get
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:26.520]  you you'll be on a list good look I'm public you're the criminals you're the
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.620]  people saying George Washington's bad and the Second Amendment's bad and I
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:34.840]  should fight off an attacker with scissors now joining us is Larry Pratt
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:40.560]  head of gun owners of America gun owners dot o RG hadn't been on in a few weeks I
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:46.040]  wanted to get his breakdown on the semi-auto ban the fact that it would
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:52.440]  make the quote officials the authorities are masters not servants exempt just
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:56.480]  including that that's a title of nobility and and and other key bills and
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.880]  attacks that we're facing and what these executive orders mean he's one of the
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.920]  busiest Liberty fighters somebody fighting for freedom out there and we
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.080]  appreciate Larry Pratt joining us Larry give us the state of the Second
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:13.160]  Amendment in this gun owners alert oh hi Alex it's really good to be with you
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:18.960]  one thing I'd like to lead off with there's a an old saw among those of us
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.080]  who fight to protect the Second Amendment that when guns are outlawed
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:29.660]  only how laws will have guns well one of the examples that just popped up on the
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:37.120]  blogs today the chat by the name of Jerome McCrory McCrory and he lives in
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:43.000]  Ohio in the Dayton area and he's been rather prominent leading a demonstration
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:50.280]  against the easy availability of guns at gun shows and yeah I can see what a guy's
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:56.880]  concerned about folks like you and me having guns he's a convicted rapist
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:06.480]  Jerome McCrory the face of the anti Second Amendment crowd I just had to
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:14.400]  share that it just is sometimes a reality is just you can make it up right
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:21.040]  anyway to the question of the bands at the I think it's pretty clear even from
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.320]  the hearing yesterday in the Senate the the Senate doesn't have the votes to
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:34.520]  ban neither guns nor magazines I think and it's I think it's actually more
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:41.560]  sinister point of attack against us is to make universal the background check
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:47.960]  that way if you can't even give to your neighbor sell to your neighbor give to
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:53.240]  your son without going to a dealer and giving the dealer all that information
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:58.840]  for the background check there's absolutely no way that we should be
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.040]  trusting the government with that information it's the fact our
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:06.960]  registration I went and bought a 50 Cal Barrett a few months ago and the whole
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.040]  thing was in a computerized form I mean I feel most gun shops now it's
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.840]  computerized in a government form you know they're getting that info I mean
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:19.440]  you know the the next system is a background check and a registration that
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.040]  you're a gun owner right there now they're legally required to destroy the
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:29.200]  names after 24 hours and Alex if you know somebody that believes that real
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.800]  estate office that I'd like to have them come over and do some business they've
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.000]  been caught memory serves a few times actually keeping the names of course and
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.160]  the fact is that they refuse to say that they are destroying the names they don't
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.920]  I guess when I get caught in an outright lie so they just hardball the thing they
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:54.720]  will not say well then there are times when yes they have done searches of
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.980]  their data and it turns out oh yes we ran a search well how'd you do that if
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:02.760]  you're not destroying the day if you if you are destroying the names after 24
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:09.280]  hours so if they get a gun registry then it's all over baby if that's when they
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.460]  can come the next time Rahm Emanuel has one of his crises well it's time to
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.060]  collect the guns mr. and mrs. America we can't trust you anymore with your guns
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:24.360]  and Diane Feinstein's dream would be fulfilled that if she'd had the votes
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.280]  she could have gotten them all well she'd know where to go if she had the
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:33.240]  registration system and frankly a government that'll send guns into
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:40.040]  Mexico and get Mexicans killed hundreds of them at this point so we know of we
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:45.560]  we're gonna trust them with our information about our guns protected by
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:53.920]  our Second Amendment not theirs ours so yeah I think we're at a very crucial
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:18:01.080]  moment and the fight Alex if I could ask people to make a call to their well
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.960]  right now they're senators but also their representatives that soon enough
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:10.720]  it's I think we've got the bands pretty well under control but where they're
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:14.600]  going to try to rope us is on the background check that's where they're
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.520]  going to make the big play if they get that they've got the whole enchilada
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:24.120]  what about the issue of another mass shooting I mean they've already set it
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:28.440]  up where we're bad because we own guns we are guilty of mass murder when
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:32.560]  someone else does something wrong the collectivist Soviet-style well somebody
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.840]  your neighborhood you know shot at one of the NKVD secret police show now
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:40.600]  everyone in the neighborhood is being sent to a gulag I mean this is the new
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.160]  Soviet model or we're collectivized with health care so now the government tells
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.680]  you what you can eat what you can do and yes there's death panels for people
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.520]  overweight and death panels for people with genetic disorders I mean you know
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.760]  we know their plan what about what do we do with the next attack how do we get
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:00.480]  back on the offensive and point out that these people have bodyguards and that
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.360]  these people wanted to be exempt where they can still own guns doesn't that
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:10.120]  fully discredit them I think that's one of very very important counter-attack
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:16.720]  and another one is kind of like unto it we've been calling for the dismantling
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.880]  of the gun-free zones particularly in schools it's been in the gun-free zone
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.640]  where most of our mass murders have occurred and it kind of makes you wonder
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.320]  if maybe that doesn't have something to do with it you know and so happily
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:37.260]  representative Stockman the first day within probably the first hour to put in
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:44.280]  a bill it's HR 35 that would do away with gun-free school zones that would
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:49.520]  take away the magnets that have drawn these maggots who want to rack up big
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:56.680]  body counts children nobody to protect them what we've been urging it really
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:59.880]  instead of a time let's stay there let's hear what you're urging to get on the

[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.800]  owners org is the number one defender of the First Amendment out there a lot of
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.840]  the great people like Ted Nugent and others and of course I count myself
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.400]  amongst the defenders of it and I'm proud of that that is the pure Americana
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:30.760]  heritage our new issue of the magazine just came in off the truck the last two
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:34.800]  issues sold out in way before the month was over I'll tell you about this the
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:39.960]  next segment it's the tyrants why the tyrants want your guns of the new issue
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:45.120]  is about 80% Second Amendment key info the five minutes we've got left with
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:50.280]  Larry Pratt you were talking about Steve Stockman the Texas congressman that you
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.240]  said wait wait till he gets in Congress he's gonna go on the offense tell us
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.080]  about that legislation and how we get that rammed rammed through and grab a
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.400]  victory from the jaws of defeat well it took him about an hour the first day and
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.440]  he had HR 35 to show for it and this is legislation that would overturn the
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:13.520]  school's own gun bans and as we know it's every single one of our mass
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:20.800]  murders in the last 20 years with one exception was in a legally required no
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:27.240]  gun zone and it just kind of makes you wonder if maybe these dirt bags don't
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:30.320]  have that figured out going in so we got to get rid of them
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.960]  Stockman's right on that and we're just very grateful that somebody with his
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:42.280]  energy and determination is willing to lead on the fight now President Obama as
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.960]  you know last Sunday came out and we played the clips here and I'm sure you
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.720]  saw it he said look gun owners need to listen to me a little more carefully I
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.040]  support the Second Amendment I love to skeet shoot it's in the news today he's
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.400]  never gone skeet shooting except for one photo op it's kind of like his club was
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:00.520]  saying I'll never come after your handguns your rifles your shotguns your
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:05.600]  semi-autos none of it so the incredible disdain and lying how he tries to tries
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.260]  to play possum with people and we've also seen the red coat Piers Morgan say
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:14.680]  oh I've lost the gunfight I've seen them play possum more than once I mean we
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:18.240]  know what the bills do what do you make of this double game where they go well
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.280]  you don't want your guns we've just introduced all the bills to do it
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.800]  meanwhile Schumer and all of them are saying we need to lean on gun
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.840]  manufacturers and retailers not to sell semi-auto I've now talked to three
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:33.840]  separate gun dealers one of them I know personally who had the ATF come in and
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:37.800]  say why don't you stop selling these and we'll we'll go nice with you how do we
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.720]  deal with the extrajudicial attacks but that's B a what do you make of this
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:51.160]  playing possum that is just not to be believed and the word the operative word
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:57.240]  is playing it's not for real these guys clearly are on a crusade and when
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.920]  they're doing that to gun dealers they're also doing something else and
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:07.120]  this is why we've never agreed with the 4473 form being required we've never
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:12.120]  agreed with the background check being required that the ATF agents are going
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:17.160]  into we're getting multiple reports going into stores either making copies
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:22.120]  or scarfing up at 4473 forms that everybody has to fill out when they buy
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:26.240]  a gun at a store and whether they bring them back or not we haven't heard but
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.840]  they're taking them so they can obviously make copies they want to make
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:35.240]  sure that nothing falls through the cracks they want a registration list
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.880]  and there's only one thing governments do with registration lists they don't
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:43.880]  fight crimes with them because they're not useful as crime fighting tools but
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:49.920]  they are useful for one thing they know where the gun owners are and you know
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.600]  maybe you only bought a say an ar-15 through a dealer and you bought handguns
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:01.360]  and shotguns privately from people you knew or at a flea market or whatever
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.040]  once they know you've got one gun they don't think they're going to stop with
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:09.840]  the one when they come to your house they're going to want to search the
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.400]  whole place they'll tear it upside down because we're criminals if we own a gun
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:21.960]  that's their mentality we must stop this drive for a universal background check
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:28.720]  Alex that is going to be the gunfight of 2013 whether or not they can complete
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:34.200]  their grab for every gun owners data through the instant background check for
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:39.640]  everybody even if it's father giving a gun to a son they're saying oh that's
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:44.120]  gotta go have an instant background check it really Larry are you getting
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.400]  are you getting Intel on the same thing that I'm hearing that they're there and
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.160]  we know Schumer said let's go lean on the gun dealers and make them not sell
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:55.000]  these and that's public statements he and others have said that are are you
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.360]  getting the reports I'm getting that the ATF saying why don't you not sell these
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:06.040]  we're getting all kinds of reports the ATF seems to be in hyper activity such
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:11.240]  as they weren't even in the most of the last four years a lot of this stuff is
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:17.680]  now ramping up now that Obama has been elected doesn't have to ever run again
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:24.440]  for any political office it's pedal to the metal this is going to be a tough
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:27.960]  fight because this guy doesn't play fair he doesn't care about the
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:32.800]  Constitution he doesn't care about federal gun laws all he wants is to make
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:37.200]  sure that he can accomplish his socialist agenda and grabbing the guns
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:42.520]  is a big part of any socialist agenda gun owners dot o RG you told me during

[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.720]  always happens over the weekend that broadcast has become incredibly popular
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:03.680]  and is on close to 100 a.m. and FM stations and many of the affiliates we've
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.540]  gotten now our stations that pick up the Sunday and get great response great
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:11.400]  ratings and then they move us to nighttime rebroadcast and almost every
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:18.120]  station then segues us to live during the day well over a hundred and fifty
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:22.080]  a.m. and FM affiliates right now very very exciting and we're very very
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.920]  blessed and thankful for all the listeners the a.m. and FM affiliates out
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:31.840]  there and our sponsors now speaking of people were thankful for I've read that
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.880]  now the NRA had a quarter million new members in the first month of this year
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:41.280]  well part of December into January and that now it's over three hundred and
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:47.640]  fifty thousand new members that's great okay but but the NRA was founded by the
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:54.320]  federal government and the NRA helped pass the 68 gun control act and I love
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:59.480]  Charlton Hessen interviewed him several times he was even manipulated into
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:03.280]  support of a 68 gun control act that's why he came out that's why he came out
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:10.480]  so so strong for the Second Amendment later because he felt guilty about that
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:15.440]  and he talked about that gun owners of America's never sold out never made
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.560]  mistakes never back down in there I don't know 30-something years of history
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:24.400]  they're the second biggest gun group they're the group we don't need to hear
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.760]  about NRA as being the only group that represents gun owners and and and and
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:33.960]  you know is a default we need to hear about gun owners dot o RG and Larry I
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.000]  know you've gotten a lot of members I know you didn't come on for this today
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.160]  but we wouldn't probably have a Second Amendment if it wasn't for your
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:47.200]  organization and your members so many times it's you guys that actually get
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:52.840]  the job done and you forced the NRA to get more hardcore again and I've got to
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:56.240]  say the NRA has gotten better you don't like to talk about the NRA can you
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:59.520]  briefly talk about the NRA talk about how many new members you've gotten and
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:03.000]  the history of this and where we are right now that I've got a few other
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  questions for you well we've had probably I would say could be a 20%
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  increase in our membership and there's the easiest way to understand the
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.040]  difference between the two groups is and you alluded to it the NRA was formed by
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:26.720]  Civil War veterans from the Union Army who were distressed about how poorly the
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.800]  Union recruits shot many of them have been Irish immigrants and probably
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:36.560]  didn't even know which end of a gun was which when they got drafted and so the
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:42.840]  NRA was set up to make rifle awareness and practice more commonplace so that if
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.760]  there were another war or when there was that the United States could draw upon a
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:52.680]  better trained pool of men so they were set up to help the government about a
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:57.640]  hundred years later we were organized gun owners of America to oppose the
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:02.760]  government to oppose the gun control that was beginning to be a regular topic
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:08.720]  of discussion in Washington and after the 68 gun control act and you alluded
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:14.160]  to the fact that the NRA really hadn't been very effective in opposing that
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:21.200]  that was kind of it our founder a former California state senator decided we
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:26.200]  needed a group that was going to oppose the government and so those those two
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:31.040]  different founding motives really kind of carried through even to today well
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:35.880]  time flies so how long has gun owners been around when was it founded we're in
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:43.560]  our 35th 36 year now yeah we're we're really delighted to see the way the
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:49.240]  growth has come in part I guess well for one thing a lot of your listeners have
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:54.160]  joined that's been a over the years that's been kind of noticeable somebody
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:00.120]  who say oh you must have done Alex Jones today the numbers spiked again tonight
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:06.640]  when people go online and then Piers Morgan bless his British heart did a
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:11.800]  little it is fair share to increase our membership and we're very grateful to
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:18.200]  Piers Morgan I think I'm not quite grateful enough to form a fan club but I
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:23.560]  do have to acknowledge that even though he didn't intend it it has I think
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:27.760]  frankly not only did he help our membership and the NRA's membership but
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.200]  I think he provided what we may look back and say that was a pivotal moment
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:38.080]  when he started lecturing yours truly about how the United States ought to
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:44.520]  operate with that bloody supercilious British accent of his that just kind of
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:50.480]  fills most Americans right up to the gag point it certainly does well gun owners
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:54.000]  dot o RG people need to go there and join or at least sign up for the free
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.280]  email alerts that are absolutely vital and again I have seen you for years I
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:03.400]  tried to get you to talk about the history of the NRA you finally went out
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.920]  of both barrels I don't know about six years ago and then they really have
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:11.960]  reformed themselves to a great extent but I've got to say I've studied
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:16.840]  history here gun owners of America without you we would have lost and I
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.280]  know you don't like to toot your horn you're a very you know restrained calm
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:25.320]  guy but Larry Pratt be honest would we have lost most of these big battles if
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:31.180]  it wasn't for the members of gun owners of America supporting your your system
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:34.840]  because I mean I mean you guys are I mean you guys are the soldiers that have
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:37.480]  kicked the New World Order's but I mean I got a I got to tell you that's why I
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:41.200]  support you and and and you know sit here and drive for people to sign up
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.880]  with you guys because if we didn't have you I think we would have lost am I am I
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:50.440]  incorrect I think our most successful lobbying accomplishment is when we can
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:58.600]  get the NRA to move in our direction and now they are opposing the expansion of
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:03.560]  the background check to private sales the back with the very background check
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:09.040]  that was their idea to begin with so that's that's right me that's progress
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.240]  that's right it's not where it ought to be but as long as we see forward
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:17.480]  movement it means that over in the Congress it's gonna make it a lot
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:21.440]  tougher because they're not going to be able to say as easily well the NRA
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:25.760]  supports those piece of gun control so what's your problem well I mean I mean
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.320]  I've been following this the reason I got on air was because they were had
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.000]  bills to ban people under 18 being able to even shoot guns it was gonna ban
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.280]  shooting sports in Texas and then I I mean so many draconian shut down gun
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:44.080]  shows I got on the air I mean I had a hunger and went and took RTF and all of
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:47.360]  it because I wanted to defend the Second Amendment not because I even am obsessed
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.360]  with guns more obsessed with you know hiking and stuff than I am guns or
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:57.520]  fishing it's that I understand how important it is historically and so
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.160]  that's why I followed the NRA standing there or even supporting stuff at the
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.560]  Texas level in the mid 90s when you guys were there fighting tooth and nail with
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:12.680]  with you know ragtag money so that's why I'm just gushing over you because I can
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:16.860]  authoritatively say we would have lost most of these battles if it wasn't for
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:21.920]  Larry Pratt and his leadership and what you guys have done so I I salute you in
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:27.400]  closing I appreciate that the gun free school zone was something supported by
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:33.000]  the NRA we opposed it now I think they've moved substantially not entirely
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:39.760]  but substantially to oppose that as well as you know our objective is to make it
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.400]  so a teacher a janitor anybody with a concealed carry permit could carry in a
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:48.640]  school they're not going to be identified with a uniform so a dirtbag
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.040]  comes in and tries to kill a lot of kids they're going to find out that they
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.960]  don't even know where the next gun is going to be coming from because there
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:59.260]  might be two or three in a school and they're all going to be pointed at the
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:03.640]  dirtbag I remember many years ago they had concealed carry had just gone in and
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:08.160]  I was listening to Dallas radio and a guy that had a bunch of carjackings it
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.560]  was as violent as Chicago some years more violent and the carjacker on
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:18.480]  Central Expressway was stop-and-go traffic he he jumped out ramped the
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:23.240]  ladies sports cars have been a fancy car and and and and told her get out he was
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:28.280]  going to steal the car and he had a gun and a guy stopped behind him got out and
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:32.280]  pumped three rounds into him the guy fell over dead and that was like two or
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:37.160]  three days after concealed carry officially went in so there's an example
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:40.240]  right there it people say oh you'll never have your gun ready when the
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.440]  attack comes concealed carry is about the criminals don't know where it is and
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.680]  it's I bet that was the point where carjackings took a nose dive in Dallas
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:55.080]  oh yeah they went did they started dropping massively in fact they're unheard of now
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:00.640]  the criminals get the message pretty fast that they're working environment
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:06.800]  just got a lot more dangerous that's the message we're trying to send to school
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.040]  mass murderers you're working we know you might want to commit suicide at the
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:14.880]  end but we're going to keep you to one or two shots how does that suit you
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:19.640]  exactly like you're not going to be able to kill 25 27 people how about you shoot
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:25.640]  one or two then we kill you that's exactly right and that I think is a time
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:30.840]  there's an idea is time hopefully has come and I'm just really excited that
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:35.880]  Steve Stockman did exactly what I hoped he would do he's taken leadership by the
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:40.720]  way there's another congressman Massey from Kentucky it seems to be pretty much
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:45.760]  of one mind with Stockman he's got a I think a similar identical bill in so
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:50.840]  we've got more than one this thing has its own momentum already but what needs
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:55.440]  to be done now if your member your listeners would please call their member
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:01.360]  of Congress and urge them to get on congressman Stockman's bill HR 35 that's
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:05.320]  the next step in building momentum to get this past the leadership of the
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:09.480]  Congress that never wants to do anything controversial and guns are always viewed
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:14.600]  as controversial even though that's what gets Republicans elected that dummies so
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:18.580]  get on the horn please call those members of Congress tell them to
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:26.760]  cosponsor HR 35 absolutely all right Larry Pratt final point here when do we
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:30.840]  really get on the offensive because you're hardcore in defending the Second
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:35.840]  Amendment but look I know the law of interview hundreds conservatively
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:39.280]  constitutional lawyers I've studied it quite a bit I know what racketeering is
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:44.180]  I know what torturous interference is I know what color of law is I know what
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:50.520]  harassment is if I tried to just verbally get people to pressure a bank
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:54.760]  to say get rid of all of their customers that are gun owners or if I tried to put
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:58.600]  pressure on a sporting goods store to not sell a particular product and I did
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:03.080]  things and said things and and and and talked about trying to withhold money
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.980]  from them and lobbying against them that would be torturous interference when you
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:12.540]  have the mob boss of Chicago we're on Chicago right now talking to him
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:17.960]  Rahm Emanuel and you've got the mob boss Bloomberg and you've got the velo groza
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:22.980]  the mob boss of LA all these guys and the mob bosses of San Francisco saying
[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:27.060]  disarm the American people take the guns while they've got bodyguards lean on the
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:30.480]  banks and banks are saying we don't want gun manufacturers we don't want gun
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:36.240]  dealers Time Warner all their violent movies they're out there saying that you
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.080]  know we won't take gun advertising on any of our cable systems I mean they're
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.920]  really trying like not like the Nazis first embargo Jews and others that's how
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:48.560]  the tyranny starts not letting them have businesses or harassing them I mean this
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:53.440]  is this is criminal things that we can do to fight back and we've already seen
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:57.880]  a spate of bills go into a number of legislators around the country
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:05.240]  nullifying one and another and sometimes many anti-constitutional federal actions
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:09.680]  and some actually say that they'll arrest a federal official who's trying
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:15.160]  to enforce an unconstitutional measure yeah what we need then is to have a
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:21.600]  state or even a county in where a sheriff is willing to take them on say
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.600]  okay in this bank we love firearms manufacturers and we'll be happy
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:31.120]  assuming assuming you've got a good balance statement to make you alone we'll
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:34.800]  be happy to do business with you we'd rather you not be with Bank of
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:39.600]  America just like Christians put the little the little fish on their company
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:44.880]  I think people need to start advertising their pro bill of rights period pro bill
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.560]  of rights would have a certified group meaning you support them all and and and
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:53.000]  have a little symbol of the gun on there I think it's saying welcome America I
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.160]  mean America was born out of self-defense now I want to play you a
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:01.400]  short clip and then let you go Homeland Security has advisors running around
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.520]  putting out videos saying don't have guns have scissors in a new training
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:11.080]  video they're advising people in in in in not in federal buildings they have
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:15.880]  guns but other office buildings and things to have scissors to fight someone
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:19.080]  that comes to kill them with a gun let's play a clip of that thank you from the
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:22.960]  view of the shooter quickly choose the best option if you are caught out in the
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:27.160]  open and cannot conceal yourself or take cover you might consider trying to
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.760]  overpower the shooter with whatever means are available show scissors to
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:34.200]  protect your hiding place lock the door if you can okay block but let's stop
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:37.160]  right there let's block the door and then the person comes knowing they're
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:42.880]  all hiding and shoots them in a fetal position why not concealed carry holders
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:49.200]  statistically have dropped crime 49% in the last 20 years FBI numbers so we
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.280]  suggest you have a company shooting club to ensure that on the off chance one in
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:57.040]  10 million that someone goes crazy others are there to equalize their bad
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:02.160]  activity I mean that's what they should be saying correct yes and when they
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:07.400]  encourage many people in the work excuse me the workplace to be armed they're
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:13.040]  really making it so that the person that might have quote unquote gone crazy will
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:18.080]  just probably be able to restrain himself because he'll realize that that
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:22.640]  kind of crazy isn't going to go anywhere absolutely and if you look at the mo of
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:26.680]  these guys they love the helplessness of little kids and knowing no one can stop
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:30.760]  them and on record a lot of times they urinate on themselves when the police
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.280]  get there and kill themselves or wait to be killed I mean these are it's the same
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.960]  they're always the last four or five guys were all devil worshippers in a row
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:43.360]  I mean why are we profiling devil worshippers devil worshippers who
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.400]  overdid video games and I did say overdid I didn't say use them at all but
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:53.800]  overdid video games it's just like you can overdo booze or food or anything
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:49:00.120]  else and and so those are common elements in these attackers and I think
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:04.320]  we better come to grips with that make sure our kids and our grandchildren or
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:09.520]  if they got some of these video games that there may be an hour or two a week
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:15.160]  rather than three or four a day sure what about suing what about suing Rahm
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:18.760]  Emanuel and Bloomberg they're always suing gun makers and gun manufacturers
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:22.680]  and publishing our names what about what about suing them for torturous
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:26.320]  interference and I believe it's racketeering I mean I mean when they get
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:29.880]  together as cities to try to overthrow our Bill of Rights and Constitution and
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.480]  tell us we're bad and tell us they're gonna lean on gun dealers until they
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:39.760]  stop selling guns I mean that is a gangster tactic well and one response
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:46.000]  can certainly be what Texas has already done and it's told firearms manufacturers
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.920]  hey it liked up in New York and in Connecticut the environment politically
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:55.080]  they're pretty nasty for you y'all come down here yeah why doesn't Remington
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:03.720]  leave Connecticut and come right down here Larry give out the number for folks
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:07.000]  that don't have computers so they can call and sign up tell them how much it
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.320]  is to support the tip of the spear in the defense of the Republic well for 20
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:17.360]  bucks you can do what Alex is saying folks call triple 8 double 8 6 guns
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:24.120]  that's 8 8 8 8 8 6 g-u-n-s and then for everybody else it's gun owners org and
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:28.120]  what is Ron Paul say about you the only no compromise second amendment lobby
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:31.200]  Larry Pratt thanks for the time we've got you back on the nightly news Monday
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:34.920]  have a great weekend coming up you too my friend thank you very much Wow
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.560]  amazing guy he's so polite tell him bye for me all right folks that is an
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:44.080]  amazing individual right there I've been in the fight for 20 years I can tell you
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:49.520]  I've been there a hundred times or more without that guy you would not have most
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:52.600]  of your guns right now they've already taken them all in Australia but bolt
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.600]  action single shot they're now trying to ban them it's the same thing they take
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.320]  the semi-auto they register everything else then they take it all we'll be back
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:04.360]  if you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators but we're
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:08.120]  waiting for an offer so crazy you couldn't refuse then you're not gonna
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:12.080]  want to miss this exciting message here's why our solar generators provide
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:16.640]  life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:21.080]  quietly emit no fumes and produce electricity from the Sun so when the
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:25.160]  lights go out you'll always have the power you need now here's the best part
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:29.880]  every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:34.960]  new we put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:38.760]  at the end of each year we call them scratch and dead units but they're
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:43.280]  really just like new each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:47.880]  bonuses you just won't believe don't wait they go fast go to scratch and
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:52.600]  dense solar.com that's scratch and dense solar.com for the craziest offer we've
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:59.840]  ever made go to scratch and dense solar.com that scratch and dense solar.com
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:06.640]  hey there Frank Bates here have you heard about the weird device that could
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:12.680]  wipe out 280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts warn
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:17.800]  that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known in fact just a
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:21.080]  few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:25.320]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:29.120]  that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the liberals and
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:33.240]  the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a free
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:38.800]  video at weird device.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:44.080]  conspiracy go watch the shocking video at weird device.com right now to discover
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:48.720]  exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you and your family can

[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:20.120]  recent widow living alone it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.800]  near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think

[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:38.520]  supporting people our local AM and FM affiliates are the reason we're reaching
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:42.680]  millions and millions and millions more people a week now it's much bigger than
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:47.080]  the internet much bigger than YouTube much bigger than prison planet TV it is
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:53.080]  where we reach the big massive audiences I just got the numbers on 590 a.m. and
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:56.920]  and they're airing of our Sunday show it's in fact I had him I was gonna show
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:02.640]  them it's not with the instant people meters it's not only number one in talk
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:07.280]  radio it's number one period by huge margins I mean just just just massive
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:11.560]  and that's what's happening on stations all over the country little stations are

[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:26.880]  meters where people you know subscribe and sign up and they put a machine in
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:29.840]  your car to track what you're listening to they've got other ones that actually
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.160]  can dial into what you're listening to because every receiver actually
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:37.000]  broadcast at a micro level but those are intrusive so those aren't really being
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:43.200]  deployed but I mean it shows that truth is popular so let me just say this
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:47.800]  support our local AM and FM thank them for the show spread the word about the

[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:42.960]  after after constitutional lawyer Bruce fine comes up and joins us for part of

[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.240]  just looking at all the good things that are happening it is booing to my heart
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:57.800]  and soul to know people are fighting back but at the same time the corruption
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:03.680]  is so ridiculously over-the-top that I mean it's just cuckoo land things have
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:13.360]  things have entered absolute total hell male complete cuckoo land and I know you
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:17.000]  know that and it's because America and the rest of the Western world because of
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.920]  TV and the culture slowly incrementally getting more and more out of control has
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:26.880]  taught people how to not care how to not be involved and how to feel powerless to
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:31.240]  where it's not even they feel powerless you know the zombie like jellyfish
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:35.560]  everybody talks about you're either awake or you're not it's that they don't
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:39.600]  even know they're jellyfish they don't even know they're spectators they don't
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:46.200]  even understand what that means to go through life and never really even be
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:52.240]  conscious and I've got to be honest with you in the last few months I've been
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:56.800]  really wound up as you can notice and it's taken a toll on me mentally because
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:06.720]  I can't turn my brain off I I've gotten to the point where all I think about is
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:11.280]  this because you come to the realization of the global is saying humanity's
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:15.880]  obsolete and they made the decision to bring in robotics to replace human labor
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:19.460]  and drones or replace the military and they say well we've got to have an arms
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:22.640]  race somebody else will get it but you realize bad guys are running our
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:26.880]  political system and that they've just decided the general public's obsolete
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.760]  and not just a cheap human resource as we've always been to the establishment
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:38.120]  but now garbage that has to be taken out and that's really my message to everybody
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:44.320]  is that really corrupt elites are in dominant control and there's always been
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:49.080]  different facets of society there's always been a different veins of society
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:51.840]  the good the bad the ugly the people that don't care the people that do care
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:55.560]  the people that are mean well but are misguided the truly evil the
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:01.460]  opportunist but now it's just such a cold-blooded corporate global system
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:06.240]  where mega corporations tie into government and use government
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:09.480]  regulation to shut down their competition government regulation to
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:14.160]  conduit banker bailout and corporate welfare to themselves and then they
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:19.920]  sick the government on corporations and companies that don't cheat to where you
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:24.000]  can't compete with it because it's a fraud you can't compete with suicide
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.880]  nets around the factories in China that have tax incentives 22 billion dollars
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:33.480]  in taxpayer money to ship General Motors to China I mean it was hard to kill the
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:37.560]  free market in America it was hard to kill jobs it was it was hard to kill five
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:41.840]  percent of the population that had half the world's wealth I mean we were
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:45.880]  amazing but now they've got us where I was reading Wall Street Journal
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:48.800]  yesterday that you guys pull this out of yesterday's stack if you have a chance
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:59.680]  the financial stack where it said that we're set to have double the debt every
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:06.200]  year that we have GDP I mean that is just that's like making $50,000 a year
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:11.600]  and you've got credit card bills every year of $100,000 I mean and that's where
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.600]  they want to take us that's where the collectivists want to take us they they
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:20.680]  brag about it it's agenda 21 it's the different sociologists that have you
[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:24.680]  know that are popular that say bankrupt things to bring in socialism this is
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:29.040]  their plan and so I wanted to get a constitutional lawyer when I come to him
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:32.120]  in the next segment here would have gone to him now but some stations don't carry
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:36.120]  this segment that we're preparing to move the clock back to six after not

[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:43.540]  the political system reverse course we've also got unprecedented attacks by
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:48.360]  Israel inside Syria while the West is funding the rebels in just unbelievable
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:52.880]  information ATF's Milwaukee sting operation marred by mistakes and

[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:03.680]  we're joined by constitutional lawyer Bruce fine and he was the main policy
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:10.180]  adviser obviously to Ron Paul during his presidential run as as weld and Bruce
[02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:13.960]  fine was associate deputy attorney general and general counsel to the
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:17.160]  Federal Communications Commission under President Ronald Reagan he served as
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:20.680]  research director for Republicans on the joint congressional committee on covert
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:23.840]  arms sales to Iran and on the American Bar Association's committee on
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.200]  presidential signing statements which we have some news on and also his recess
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.600]  appointments and he's a constitutional lawyer again he has been a visiting
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:35.960]  fellow for the constitutional studies at the Heritage Foundation an adjunct
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:39.000]  scholar the American Enterprise Institute mr. fine is the founding
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.360]  member of Bruce fine and associates Inc a law corporation is the principal of
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:45.920]  public advocacy organization the Lynchfield group he is the author of
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:50.000]  constitutional peril the life-and-death struggle for a constitutional democracy
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.080]  and American Empire before the fall which I've read is an excellent book mr.
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:57.600]  fine presently serves a senior policy adviser again to the Ron Paul 2012
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:01.520]  presidential campaign that was the latest on his bio and he's advised
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:07.840]  Congress generally as constitutional scholar obviously the guns up front
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:11.760]  constitutionally I want you to get your take on the whole waterfront on this but
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:16.840]  they've now got state bills and the main Feinstein bill that says basically I
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:21.400]  call a violation of the Constitution because it's titles of nobility where
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:26.840]  where the all the government bureaucrats and the police are given immunity from
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:32.520]  having their semi-autos registered and then taken under the New York model but
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:38.720]  but then everybody else has to turn their guns in or can't buy these guns or
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.440]  can't transfer these guns you're the constitutional lawyer so to quantify
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:47.120]  just my crude understanding where am I correct in the Constitution Bill of
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:49.720]  Rights because I know there's some sections in there I want to make sure
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:53.600]  I'm right on these I mean that's like them saying you know blacks are
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:57.680]  two-thirds humans so they don't have rights again and this is the fundamental
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:00.960]  deal when you know you're in North Korea where they have a hereditary
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:05.320]  dictatorship it's royalty when the royalty is exempt the government is
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:09.360]  exempt is that not royalty constitutional lawyer Bruce fine and
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:13.320]  what do we do I mean you would think that would discredit Diane Feinstein
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:16.920]  immediately when she says well Congress will be exempt but they're already
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:20.560]  exempt on Obamacare they're already exempt on insider trading I mean how
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.520]  have we gotten to this are they only missing the gold crowns and how do we
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:31.640]  redress this when the the Congress is all there at the trough where's fine
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:39.000]  that's quite an introduction let's begin by I think articulating the fundamental
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.400]  issue that we confront and I guess it confronts all the nations that emerge
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:48.080]  from a state of nature and it goes back to what is the final end of the state
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:52.200]  and our founding fathers believed that the final end of the state was to make
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:56.240]  men and women free to develop their faculties and to seek their fulfillment
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:00.880]  in their unique ways and that the exception to Liberty was a government
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:06.280]  intrusion but that required passing a very high threshold of need but the
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:09.880]  final end of the state was not to make government big it was not to go abroad
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:13.600]  in search of monsters to destroy it was not even necessarily to have an
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:18.680]  unemployment rate that was low or GNP that was high but Liberty was the final
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:22.800]  end of the state for the individuals to choose to develop their faculties and
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:27.360]  what you've described is really an inversion of that understanding at
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:31.440]  present because now the presumption is government should be permitted to
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:36.440]  regulate anything unless it would reduce you to complete serfdom like you know
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:40.600]  citizens under Nazi Germany which is I say a total perversion of our
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:44.640]  understanding of what we are as a nation and how the Constitution is intended to
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:49.440]  operate now with regard specifically to the Second Amendment right to keep and
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:56.880]  bear arms the issues vary depending upon what the statutes say but to give some
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:02.360]  beef background the United States Supreme Court has held that both the
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:08.080]  federal and the state governments are limited by regulating guns to permitting
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:15.160]  those that are in common usage and and otherwise were relevant to performing in
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:19.800]  the militia at the time of the founding it hasn't other than these two major
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:25.200]  cases saying that there's an individual right to gun ownership and not
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:30.280]  articulating all the scope of the regulations permitted this largely in
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:34.760]  the aftermath it's gone down to lower courts to decide whether or not
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:42.800]  regulations for example forbidding any gun to be used in public or disclosed in
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:47.640]  public the courts have come out in different ways I think if we want to
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:52.820]  try to break them down Alex in terms of the constitutional issues one is a due
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:58.580]  process and fair warning are the arms AK for assault rifles or whatever are they
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:03.040]  described with sufficient particularity that somebody would know whether they're
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:09.260]  in or outside the box that's been a huge problem because it's not like doing
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:13.920]  Euclidean geometry and describing what is a so-called assault weapon and say
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:17.800]  that's you have a due process right to know what's what's being forbidden or
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:24.000]  not a second issue so they call it just compensation issue if you take handguns
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.120]  other firearms that are in common usage and suddenly say they can no longer be
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:32.120]  used have you taken someone's property without just compensation do you have to
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:37.320]  pay fair market value all the inventory that stranded in gun owners or dealers
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:42.040]  are taking a weapon that can be used now and then it's made illegal it's become
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:46.120]  worthless or its values been substantially depreciated it's another
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:52.080]  one then the basic right and insofar as their absolute prohibitions the question
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:57.160]  is whether or not the weapon the firearms being banned are and have been
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:02.760]  in common usage in the United States and that can vary of course from firearm to
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:06.880]  firearm so in the areas that I think that will be confronting in the
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:12.360]  aftermath of the Newtown killings in the burst of legislation certainly in a
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:16.200]  handful of states New York Maryland seems clear to follow California is
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:21.240]  always in that line for some kind of avant-garde prohibition on liberty and
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:29.200]  at the federal level it's it's still uncertain whether there will be some and
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.400]  the extent of any federal legislation but I want to go back to the basic point
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:37.920]  Alex and that's our understanding of where we are as a nation because the
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:43.440]  other items that you enumerated for discussion whether it's ATF invasions
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:47.360]  and the going abroad and having our military involved now with predator
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:52.280]  drones in Mali and in Niger and Burkina Faso places people can't even understand
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:57.280]  all of these are symptoms of the inversion of who we are as a nation from
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:01.560]  one where the final end and goal of the state is liberty to one where the final
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:04.880]  end and goal of the state is bigger government attempting to control and
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:08.760]  dominate everything and I want to go to that big question because humans live
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:13.680]  75 years on average basically the Bible says they live that long 3,000 years ago
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:17.200]  the Old Testament said that's how long you're given 75 that's still the average
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:22.640]  today it's amazing on average worldwide we know humans act the same do the same
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:26.720]  thing over and over again the founders knew that they tried to tie down the
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:30.880]  tyranny and create checks and balances but I want to get into the fact that
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:35.360]  there's this race to tyranny and why empires always follow this exact paradigm
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:40.960]  that you've written about with such gravitas but you know I your latest book
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:44.800]  and and then how to stop it by understanding it or are we still going to
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:49.600]  be hoisted on our own petard you know reliving this Groundhog Day nightmare but
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:52.080]  but I'm asking you as constitutional lawyer I know you spoke to it some
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:57.400]  obviously how does Congress exempt itself from everything it puts us under
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:01.720]  isn't that grounds for impeachment of all of the scallywags that have gone
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:07.080]  along with us impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors and you're
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:10.840]  absolutely accurate that Alex that at the founding it was thought
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:17.120]  inconceivable that that members would be exempt from the rules that apply to
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:22.200]  everyone else indeed one of their sense of assurance that the system would
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:27.040]  operate with the proper checks was the idea that the members would invariably
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:31.880]  at some time returned to the general citizenry and be subject to the same laws
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:36.360]  they had passed and they didn't conceive of what we know today are professional
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:40.760]  politicians who remain forever in office and therefore are never subject to their
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:46.080]  own laws that they pass and that's a breakdown a important law should not be
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:49.480]  the ultimate sin should we make that into a bigger deal you don't even hear
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:55.760]  this discussed yes I I admit that that is something that could be considered as
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:00.040]  a constitutional amendment as I say the founding fathers couldn't even conceived
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:04.400]  of a professional politician I mean George Washington left very clean after
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:08.880]  two terms and you had to yank him to to stay more than one term and if you look
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:12.880]  at the average longevity of the initial member of Congress of the Senate it was
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:15.600]  very short let me ask you that historically as you are historian not
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:19.000]  just constitutional lawyer from your research what what made our founders
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.440]  different they were the only revolutionaries to ever take over and
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:26.240]  not become tyrants everybody else does I mean why were we blessed with people
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:30.800]  this good and now they're demonized all over the news like the scum of the earth
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:35.840]  one is that I think the political culture was far different than at
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:41.160]  present and ears of the irony if you will Alex maybe irony is the wrong word
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:45.880]  maybe paradox is better that we had in some sense a much higher political
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:51.680]  culture in 1776 1787 that understood that politics wasn't a football game
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:55.160]  where you had the red team and the blue team and you hope one team lost and one
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:59.560]  team won and everything was fixated on just remaining in power they actually
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:03.600]  thought of politics as the art of making everyone win and although there could be
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:08.160]  differences the the unity of values would keep the country afloat they
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:13.540]  wanted to build a powerful wonderful society correct we were Liberty was the
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:17.800]  North Star not big government and empires and part of that too however
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:25.040]  Alex was because our founding generation was born knowing what tyranny felt like
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:28.280]  because they were the subjects of tyranny they were the ones who
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:32.720]  confronted George the third and the tyrannical acts no taxation without
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:36.200]  representation where the Lords were exempt from everything they were under
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:39.320]  that that hit that hypocrisy come back and give us that history less than I
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:43.360]  want to get into your fights currently the recess appointments some of the

[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:18.280]  got cut off by the break you were getting into a higher political culture
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:23.120]  people being more aware and then you were starting to get off into what we've
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:29.560]  become now I mean secret arrest NDAA checkpoints TSA in Austin searching
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:34.720]  people without warrants now my dad sent me a bill this morning I meant to get to
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:39.320]  where they're now going to levy a thing for it's a state bill where every
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:44.000]  medical examination you get a piece of money is sent in a fee for state
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:53.160]  teachers state teacher retirement funds I mean it's it's just turning into a
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:58.640]  total orgy of thieving all the government arms against us openly what
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:02.720]  do we do when an empire starts doing this and and what do you predict is
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:11.160]  going to happen next in this insane orgy of tyrannical behavior start at the
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:18.880]  beginning our founding fathers had first-hand experience with subjection to
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:26.800]  charity and overreaching and so they were much more embracing of libertarian
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:32.760]  ideas because they could see the temptations of tyranny taking a nation
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.960]  through a nation as it did Great Britain ultimately but the the founding
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:43.160]  generation basically died off with John Quincy Adams presidency terminating in
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:49.480]  1828 and it became more and more situation where the leaders of government
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:56.560]  had never been subjects they'd never been the the brunt of tyrannical action
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:02.160]  and they began to want government to be bigger because that meant their office
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:08.400]  holding had more stature and more power and it's been a steady trajectory since
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:13.000]  really the Mexican-American war where the purposes of government have changed
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:19.240]  from liberty of the individual to power for the government and how do we change
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:23.200]  this because now we're sort of at the high-water mark of the Empire so I call
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:26.880]  it the psychology of Empire where the government does everything to try to
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:31.800]  make your you know a risk-free existence and in the name of a risk-free existence
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:36.920]  you lose all of your liberty and freedom and that's also true not only
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:40.160]  domestically where we'll have surveillance drones throughout the
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:45.440]  nation probably before our lifetimes ends Alex and we go abroad in search of
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:49.160]  monster to destroy anything that moves anywhere in the world there's the United
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:53.360]  States say in countries can't even be pronounced by most people how many people
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:58.120]  would know where Molly is or Niger or Burkina Faso or Yemen or things of that
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:02.880]  sort and again it's this idea that government and strength and power and
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:06.680]  domination coercion is who we are as a nation it's making us resented abroad
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:11.120]  just as it's evoking resentment in the United States at home now how does this
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:15.680]  kind of psychology change it really can change in my judgment only with
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:19.880]  leadership because ordinary people don't quite understand that a risk-free
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:25.080]  existence is an exchange sort of a Faustian exchange with vassals that you
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:30.360]  can't have a risk-free existence without making everyone a candidate for prison
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:35.120]  for detention because we're all capable of evil even if the capability is small
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:41.600]  and someone has to stand up and say no we'd rather be free than risk-free and
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:47.520]  as a leader saying I want to renounce or scale back or downsize government not
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:51.760]  increase it government doesn't know better than you you are master of your
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:55.840]  soul you're a captain of your fate you have the pride and dignity of determining
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:28:01.040]  your end point where you make of what your endowments are a government just
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:06.040]  has a give you an even playing field but other than that we would destroy your
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:10.480]  own dignity if we attempted to give you a crush for it and the goal is to get
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:14.440]  everybody on welfare in the system how do we reverse it then because we know
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:19.760]  historically where the Empire goes next it starts imploding everything and as
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:23.520]  things get worse it starts confiscating more and more and then it only
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:29.040]  accelerates is there any way out of the nightmares that are caused when empires
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:35.760]  begin to rot well Alex there have been about 72 prior empires tracing back to
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:41.560]  the Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire and all the Romanov Empire I don't need
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:45.880]  to identify them all and not a single one has been able to escape you know the
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:49.360]  clutches of ruination as you've described them bigger bigger government
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:55.720]  risk-free existence everybody's dependent that the tax receivers get
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:29:00.600]  larger the taxpayers get narrower and the question is can the United States be
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:05.480]  the first empire in history that sees the precipice and walks back my judgment
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:10.440]  can be done but only with extraordinary leadership I still think people given a
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:13.920]  proper impeccable character and understanding of who we are and the

[02:33:02.320 --> 02:33:09.920]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:25.880]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us doing a few
[02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:29.160]  more minutes with constitutional lawyer Bruce fine we've talked about the
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:34.040]  history we've talked about where we currently are is it that Obama is worse
[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:38.120]  than the last few presidents or is it that the power structure has just gotten
[02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:43.080]  more accustomed to tyranny because historically you see where tyrants and
[02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:48.360]  tyrannies creep up corrupt systems do and then finally the bottom falls out
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:52.960]  when they realize hey we've got our people in almost everywhere we've got
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:57.720]  the force we can just do whatever we want and clearly we're reaching that
[02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:02.880]  that tipping point I hope as Ron Paul has said and as you've said and for many
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:06.600]  years use the tipping point to go back into Liberty and we do have the
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:10.400]  Constitution and Bill of Rights the power structure has been blaming for our
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:14.320]  problems when clearly when we followed it we had half the world's wealth and
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:20.360]  5% of the population we leave it to our ruination I mean it's total cause and
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:24.680]  effect so so so answer that question and then run through some of the other big
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.800]  issues that are front and center for you the good the bad and the ugly I know
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:31.960]  there's been some victories against tyranny lately but also some defeats but
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:36.640]  are we not approaching that flashpoint or do you think it'll just continue to
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:41.120]  be a creeping rotting because I see the power structure grabbing everything it
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:46.360]  can really I think out of a sense that they know we know Bruce fine
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:51.720]  constitutional lawyer you know your take on that I think that we have across the
[02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:58.640]  Rubicon into at least a psychological tyranny Alex I have regularly postulated
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:02.780]  that if the current president or a future president called a press
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:06.240]  conference in the evening and stated that the Constitution was being
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:09.840]  suspended and the executive was asserting all power in order to make us
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:15.320]  safe and comfortable and prosperous that such an individual would not be impeached
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:18.960]  by Congress there would not be calls like it Watergate for Nixon's ouster
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:25.600]  that the people would accept a tyranny if you will and I don't believe that
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:30.640]  politically a president would find that necessary and wise to do at present I
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:35.120]  don't think Obama is likely to do it but at some point we'll get Caligula in the
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:40.800]  White House and the precedents of unlimited presidential power lie around
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:44.400]  like loaded weapons ready to be used by any successor in the White House and if
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:50.040]  we just want to give as an example of the ultimate apogee if you will of
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:54.720]  tyranny just think of what the president is saying about his authority to use a
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:00.120]  predator drone to kill the US citizens anytime anyplace anywhere he says on
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:05.460]  secret evidence that you are an imminent threat the United States there's no
[02:36:05.460 --> 02:36:10.620]  accountability all this is done in secret we have given one person in the
[02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:15.640]  Oval Office the ability to play judge jury prosecutor and executioner all in
[02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:21.640]  secret now think of that Alex it is impossible to endow any one individual
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:25.860]  with more power than to choose anybody on the planet for vaporization that's
[02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:29.600]  where we are the other things that the president claims authority to do and is
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:34.800]  exercising like intercepting our emails and telephone calls without any warns
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:39.660]  without any suspicion it's incredible it is it truly incredible especially to me
[02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:44.100]  because my baptism Alex was Watergate where a third-rate burglary ultimately
[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:47.760]  ended up being an impeachable offense that drove mr. yeah the president spied
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:51.120]  without warrants and he had to step down or he would have been convicted the
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:55.040]  Senate let me go back to the drone for a moment and then get back into the
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:58.320]  eloquent points you're making with constitutional lawyer here best-selling
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:05.600]  author Bruce fine take take the drones Al Sharpton came out and said hey don't
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:09.480]  worry about your guns we're gonna take them we got predator drones and I see on
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:13.360]  the so-called left who aren't really left in my view Thomas Jefferson was a
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:18.480]  liberal these people are authoritarians they say it on no exaggeration 2030 shows
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:23.680]  I've seen and news articles they go hey forget your guns we got drones we've got
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:28.800]  artillery we'll use them on you and I feel worship by those gathered around
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:34.840]  the state with a reflected glory they are getting off on executive power like
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:40.320]  it's a god they're worshipping or a golden calf you are up there on Capitol
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:44.040]  Hill obviously battling all this you have to be around these people but but I
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:49.800]  mean I've been following this intensely for 20 years there is a demoniac glow to
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:54.000]  a lot of the minions activities now higher level globalists look scared but
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:59.040]  a lot of the minions Bruce look really really animated like dancing around
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:03.520]  their idol can you elaborate on that or have you seen them gloat on their
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:08.960]  military firepower and how they'll use it on us domestically I don't know
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:15.360]  whether that is widespread domestically except in metaphorical ways I will say
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:21.000]  this however that it's not a party issue the members of Congress are what I call
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:25.640]  you know invertebrates they do not want the accountability they do not want to
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:30.480]  accept the responsibility which the Constitution fastens upon them to
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:35.800]  oversee to check to block executive power when the founding fathers are you
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:39.400]  know we're writing the Constitution they feared a bloated executive and they
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:44.360]  couldn't have imagined Congress being so so kind to voluntarily surrender the
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:49.760]  decisions to wage war or not you know to levy or taxes or to spend all this is
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:53.080]  now delegated to the president separation of powers you'd have power
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:57.600]  hungry people in all three branches not letting the other have the power yes but
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:03.080]  what they didn't anticipate Alex was the polarization created by the party system
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:07.280]  they did not think that Democrats and Republicans in Congress would sell their
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:10.800]  souls for a mess of pottage with that they would believe their loyalty was not
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:14.840]  to the Constitution or their institution but to their party so you always have
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:18.320]  one party in Congress willing to block the other party's effort to check the
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:22.240]  president and in that way the presidential power simply grows it
[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:26.320]  metastasizes like a cancer and it's been true under Republican and Democratic
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:30.200]  presidents alike and under Obama presidential power it has reached its
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:35.200]  apex it's never been this authoritative before and when we can ask a president
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:41.000]  who refuses even to explain to the public or to Congress why he thinks he
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.680]  has this legal authority to kill us all and all of it is a secret secret law
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:50.680]  that even Caligula didn't practice in Roman times and he gets away with that
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:56.080]  with a complacent public in a Congress that doesn't demand that he will have no
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:59.520]  money you will be impeached unless he explains why he thinks what he's doing
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:04.320]  is legal it shows you how can we give more power to an executive than that
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:09.920]  it's a very very dismaying situation and unless we have a leader who comes to the
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:13.280]  White House and gives back the power because Congress will take it back only
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:19.400]  a president who says I understand the folly of of tyranny and I don't want to
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:23.520]  exercise it if that doesn't happen we will not be a republic we will be
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:28.040]  totally ruined as an agent in 20 or 30 years time we simply cannot go forward
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:33.120]  with one person making all the decisions in secret and no one accepts accepting
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:38.120]  constant I mean responsibility and plus no criticism being permitted because in
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:41.820]  the executive branch you descend from the president you are crushed you know
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:47.520]  they will attempt to badmouth you to assassinate your character and otherwise
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:51.760]  and there you can see it with a six espionage prosecutions for so-called
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:56.480]  whistleblowers and look at the CIA guy that exposed illegal torture and just
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:00.000]  got 30 months he should be getting he should be getting a medal and a
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.560]  whistleblower award instead the secret torture continues and Obama's been caught
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:08.840]  lying about that and a guy that tried to work through channels and nothing stopped
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:12.720]  lets them an investigative journalists know without even giving away you know
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:16.240]  code names and things so that an investigation could start and they put
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:19.760]  him in jail and see that's the paradox people say all the tyranny is not that
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:23.520]  bad we still have some liberty running but if you look at what they've put into
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:28.560]  law as you said the Nazis did all this stuff in basements and in secret
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:33.200]  facilities but they didn't put open stuff like this on paper the Soviets
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:39.080]  didn't I mean it's so amazing that they've put it all on paper and then the
[02:41:39.080 --> 02:41:42.960]  mainstream media goes oh you're a kook you said we're going into tyranny we
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:48.120]  need guns the parasols from the tyranny there's no tyranny well the gentleman
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:52.320]  you spoke of John Kiriakou of a work where he's a very admirable person and
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:57.880]  and it is an example of the one person who set the dynamic for prohibiting a
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:01.040]  torture waterboarding is the one who goes to prison all the ones who
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:05.520]  participated in the waterboarding the church or get off scot-free it is
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:08.840]  another situation I'm working with a fellow named Tony Schafer I used to work
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:13.440]  at at DIA and they're trying to revoke his bronze medal because you know he's
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:18.080]  in a retired status now because he's criticized the tactics in Afghanistan
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:21.680]  and elsewhere somebody who risked that last full measure of devotion for the
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:25.840]  country now has his bronze medal under attack because he has the audacity to
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:29.400]  say you know maybe you're not omniscient in the White House and you're exactly
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:33.560]  right when those kinds I say these are the people who you and I read about
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:37.240]  where the Sakharov's and Solzhenitsyn's getting sentenced to prison in the
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:41.200]  Soviet Union but we're not supposed to be the Soviet Union and yet we are
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:45.480]  aping their rather dedicated approach to government Bruce fine we've got to get
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:50.280]  you back up soon and I mean our only hope I think is to point out why things
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:53.960]  are getting bad point out historically why it's wrong and just stand against
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:58.600]  them and I think there's enough enough vestigial liberty there not in the
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:01.980]  Congress but in the spine of the American people that if we all just say
[02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:05.780]  no and we all take action we've seen the court striking down the recess
[02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:09.400]  appointments and some I mean we are seeing a few good signs hopefully we can
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:12.200]  turn this around but we know this it's only gonna get worse if we don't stand
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:17.880]  up so the only course is say no that is absolutely correct and remember the
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:22.840]  saying of Tacitus as the Roman Republic degenerated to the Roman Empire the
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:28.360]  worst crimes were dared by a few willed by more but tolerated by all we don't
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:32.360]  want to be subject to that kind of stigma it needs us to tolerate it and
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:37.160]  that's why they shout down I see articles where they go how dare the man

[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:10.360]  somebody's hiring of course all the elites are basically left alone I wanted
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:13.480]  to bring up Ted Anderson and yeah it's gonna be a gold pitch but that's not why
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:17.600]  he's really here I saw some gold deals we're gonna talk about gold with the
[02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:21.360]  economy with Ted Anderson the founder of Midas resources and the Genesis Network
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:24.960]  and I got went and got he was a sponsor before he started this network because I
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:31.360]  go out and get people that sell numismatics at at at bullion prices but I
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:35.480]  called Ted this morning I said I heard a radio ad last night on one of the
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:37.760]  biggest talk show hosts in this country and I'm not even gonna say names you
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:41.200]  know who it is they've been in trouble for this before I said what were they
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:44.840]  really selling stuff for we're gonna skip this network break as I'm so far
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:48.520]  behind I can do this plus it's important to get this out so station shouldn't be
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:56.280]  going over this in about three months as a network break but Ted I call tick
[02:47:56.280 --> 02:47:59.280]  because I know about the gold silver business pretty good I've been in it for
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:03.160]  17 years and Ted started the network 15 years ago I've been working with him 17
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:07.680]  years about 16 he was a sponsor right away I was a local radio as I went out
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:10.840]  and shopped and found the real folks and did some research and I've been with Ted
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:19.400]  ever since and I heard this ad for a coin and I knew the coin was a hundred
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:23.280]  and fifty percent higher than it should be it's great for a company to have five
[02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:26.960]  percent maybe on something was hard to get a 10% markup that's great you gotta
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:29.800]  be able to make money to keep your lights on you know hold the stuff sell
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:33.400]  it do all that on on average Ted's got about a five percent markup he's got
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:38.160]  deals where he loses money where you can get two silver dollars at cost two films
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:44.800]  and a book for free called a loss leader but I'm not differentiating the
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:47.280]  competition that's the oldest trick in the book saying you know that their
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:50.920]  hamburgers are crap we don't where's the beef ours are off beef patties check
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:56.440]  this out for yourself a lot of the big national talk show host one of them
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:59.920]  lives right here in Texas move down here it's gonna leave it at that got in
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:03.080]  trouble for stuff with a hundred percent markup this is a hundred and fifty I was
[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:09.280]  hearing and I just it just blows me away that Ted Anderson on average is about a
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:15.000]  five percent markup and and and that Ted is it's got it's doing such a you know a
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:19.920]  good job at what he's doing and I just think people need to know people need to
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:23.720]  price check they need to shop and they need to call Midas resource we'll get
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:27.160]  into the economy in a moment I just want to get this out here upfront like let me

[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:55.960]  gold and money a book and two videos two silver dollars seventy two dollars I
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:50:00.420]  mean you can't even get them hardly anywhere for that price plus the two
[02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:03.780]  free films and the book I mean it's a totally insane deal yeah click on that
[02:50:03.780 --> 02:50:07.760]  for folks I want people to be able to see this I mean we've had this deal for
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:11.840]  a year no this is the best deal in silver anywhere no one can top it
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:16.160]  dishonest money the book American dream film Obama deception eight hundred six
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.580]  eight six two two three seven I said Ted come on and do a money report about the
[02:50:20.580 --> 02:50:22.860]  big runs on silver that are happening right now I've got some of those
[02:50:22.860 --> 02:50:26.640]  articles rush to safety Americans by nearly half a million dollars of gold
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:30.080]  and silver in January but the media is trying to keep the price down with
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:34.360]  different manipulations which is a great buying opportunity I mean ladies and
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:37.560]  gentlemen try to find two silver dollars especially these that are collectible
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:41.600]  but he's selling them to get bullion prices for seventy dollars with the free
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:45.720]  shipping the shipping is included in that as they do bait and switches with
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:51.080]  that and the films and all the rest of it I mean that is that is insane asylum
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:56.760]  level deal eight hundred six eight six two two three seven but it's just that I
[02:50:56.760 --> 02:51:01.480]  know Ted's got over a thousand affiliates Ted is getting with all his
[02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:05.080]  shows most of our libertarian or constitutionalist in base he is
[02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:09.120]  absolutely launched this show standing behind me for 15 years to the cover of
[02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:16.040]  talkers magazine to over 150 affiliates and exploding right now with this
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:19.480]  hardcore message it's the truth but it you know imagine this is on the air big
[02:51:19.480 --> 02:51:23.040]  stations now all over because people now know it's real they now know I'm not
[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:26.560]  crazy I was ahead of my time I wish I wasn't being proven right this is this
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:31.440]  is a big deal folks my point is Midas resources is the place to buy your
[02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:35.280]  silver and gold and if you want numismatics you want collectibles they've
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:40.240]  got them okay and they've got the best deals on collectibles compare their
[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:44.320]  numismatics to what you're hearing I hear some good deals on other radio
[02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:48.480]  shows but I mean some of these are just horrible you will get the best deals and
[02:51:48.480 --> 02:51:53.720]  I stand behind what I promote okay I've been approached by big giant gold
[02:51:53.720 --> 02:51:56.880]  sponsors and and and offered unbelievable amounts of money but I will
[02:51:56.880 --> 02:52:03.760]  not sit there and sell old ladies a coin that should be $1,000 for $2,500 I will
[02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:09.240]  not do it hell would freeze over plus people get mad at you because in the
[02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:13.760]  market you know it's gone it's gone from 300 bucks to you know 2,000 and then it
[02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:16.720]  goes back down to 1,700 people get mad they're not looking at the long-term
[02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:19.960]  graph it's only going up they get mad when you sell them stuff at a great deal
[02:52:19.960 --> 02:52:23.160]  and then and then and then they manipulate the market and it goes down
[02:52:23.160 --> 02:52:26.600]  they apologize later when it goes back up I don't buy it for an investment I
[02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:30.160]  buy it as an emergency backup but it's been about the best investment out there
[02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:36.360]  unless you're doing insider stuff in the last 12 years it's gone from 300 it was
[02:52:36.360 --> 02:52:40.680]  even lower but I've heard about about 300 like 260 or something up to right at
[02:52:40.680 --> 02:52:46.360]  2,000 you know the point is and then drop back down some I got Chad on about
[02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:49.640]  financial news but I'm just an honest person you know with a little gold pitch
[02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:54.080]  in there as a sponsor I just start plugging what I believe in Midas resources
[02:52:54.080 --> 02:53:00.040]  is the place and when it comes to bullion when it comes to bullion with
[02:53:00.040 --> 02:53:03.280]  people that actually sell it to you see some deals occasionally because I've
[02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:06.580]  looked around before I've seen deals where they claim something you call up
[02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:11.320]  over out of that we have this you don't get dealt with Midas resources Ted you
[02:53:11.320 --> 02:53:17.320]  know hits the escape pod you know the ejection seat on brokers in about 10
[02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:21.920]  seconds when he discovers you know anything and it could because again the
[02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:25.080]  the whole gold and silver industry is people don't have the facts is a snake
[02:53:25.080 --> 02:53:31.000]  pit that's why I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen Midas resources 800 6 8 6
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:36.520]  2 2 3 7 and now is the time to support the biggest sponsor you not only get
[02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:40.400]  great deals you support the guy that stood behind me like nobody else you
[02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:44.280]  know I don't have the others of America as a sponsor I was thinking when he was
[02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:47.960]  on I'll try to get him a sponsor because he says we're one of the biggest groups
[02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:50.120]  getting a members but I'm doing it because they're a group defending my
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:54.360]  Second Amendment you know they don't pay me to get them on and say join them now
[02:53:54.360 --> 02:54:00.160]  Midas resources does but they're the sponsor I've got and they're already you
[02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:03.200]  know sponsoring the website they're the sponsor I've got because they were the
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:07.040]  best group I could find and they're still the best group you know I've come
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:09.800]  to Ted before when he can't spend more money on can you spend more so I can
[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:13.480]  expand my operation he goes I'm sorry I just can't I'm like one being offered
[02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:16.680]  three times more money by somebody else right now your contract but let me tell
[02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:20.040]  you most you say well I would do the same really really somebody comes and
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:25.680]  offers you millions of dollars to screw people would you do it see I say no and
[02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:30.120]  does that mean everything's absolutely perfect and you won't get the very best
[02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:34.160]  deal the galaxy ever saw none of this is perfect but Ted has a great operation
[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:42.840]  and the best prices I found consistently 800 6 8 6 2 2 3 7 800 6 8 6 2 2 3 7 and
[02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:46.240]  just like we stand behind gunners of America we just stand behind people like
[02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:50.520]  Ted because now is the time to get your gold your silver from Ted Anderson now
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:54.520]  Ted I wanted to get you on about currency manipulation what's happening in
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:57.960]  the economy the statement by the White House that they're gonna go ahead and go
[02:54:57.960 --> 02:55:03.000]  with dollar devaluation QE unlimited what this signifies but I know I talked
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  to you this morning and I said well we got to do a report on this not nasty not
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:14.640]  even naming names but I'm morally have to just tell people that you know and
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:18.520]  it's not that I these people attack me and I don't attack them is the point
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:23.320]  because they see me as competition because they copy what we cover it just
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:28.480]  blows me away the cutthroat crap I see and then to see you down there honest
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:33.240]  and people running off and getting a hornswaggled I mean I guess it's legal
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:38.320]  what people do it's just and it's okay to make a profit I just I just when
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:42.240]  people advertise great deals I've got a right to say it's not a great deal
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:48.080]  Midas resources is the best deal out there consistently 800 6 8 6 2 3 7 I mean
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:51.640]  Ted explain to people this what I'm talking about here as much as you want
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:58.440]  to say well the thing about it is Alex is that I see a lot of this advertising
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:04.200]  for you know we've got this exclusive deal on a country coin that's brand new
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:07.800]  you only can buy it from us problem is you typically end up paying a big
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:11.280]  premium for that kind of stuff and you're not going to get it back when you
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:13.480]  go to see you told me it was a hundred fifty percent on what you heard
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:16.520]  yesterday a hundred fifty percent I've seen it all the way up to four hundred
[02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:20.240]  percent Alex it gets it goes out of this world you don't like to talk about this
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:25.180]  it's like Larry Pratt doesn't want to talk about the NRA you know it's you
[02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:28.320]  know it's sort of the it's sort of the dark side of the industry but it does
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:33.320]  happen and I I just need to tell people to stay away from that stuff I mean
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:37.880]  you're just because a country goes in and makes a new coin a lot of the times
[02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:42.040]  it's the coin dealer that comes in and approaches the country's mint and says
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:46.060]  hey you can make a lot of money on this we'll promote it and and they make up
[02:56:46.060 --> 02:56:49.880]  the special deal and people end up paying a big price it's gonna be the
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:53.840]  next greatest collectible folks the coins that are collectible are known and
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:58.480]  certified and whether it's a revolutionary penny which I happen to
[02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:03.400]  have been gifted by a grandfather didn't even know I had it oh yeah I think I'm
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:06.440]  gonna probably sell even though it's an heirloom to fund the operation the point
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:12.080]  is is that is that Ted here's an example let's not even what are some of the best
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:15.160]  numismatics and people are really into those I mean what are the classics that
[02:57:15.160 --> 02:57:18.520]  are really are worth a lot that you could go to New Zealand and they'd open
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:22.520]  a coin book and know what it was well I mean the the obvious coins are the
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:26.760]  $20 st. God and $20 Liberty $10 liberties 10 Indians I mean the stuff
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:31.320]  that was used here as currency in this nation I even have a tendency to stay
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:35.000]  away from the higher premium graded stuff at this point just because I can
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:39.040]  see what's going on in the economy we're looking at a depression and because
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:42.680]  we're looking at a depression I think it's more important to have something
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:47.560]  like a survival bag of dimes than it is to have one coin that's worth five six
[02:57:47.560 --> 02:57:52.720]  seven thousand or I've seen coins go for 250,000 300,000 and there are
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:56.400]  legitimate coins that so yeah I know there are a lot of great collectible
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:00.880]  coins the thing is you better get a red book that Midas sells at cost you better
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:05.080]  learn your stuff you know it'd be like you know becoming a horse trader you
[02:58:05.080 --> 02:58:07.960]  won't start buying selling horses great you better spend 20 years learning about
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:12.320]  it right exactly that's what I mean Alex it's more important that people get
[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:16.160]  their core position something that they can fall back on I've got a million gold
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:20.240]  and silver right now that's that's exactly where I think people should go
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:23.880]  or if you're gonna go into Numa stay close to melt that's the main thing
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:28.120]  that's the thing you sell a lot of coins that are collectible but that are
[02:58:28.120 --> 02:58:31.120]  actually close to melt and that's the biggest winner folks for my research
[02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:38.680]  that's what I do 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 I want to look deeper into the
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:47.600]  world economy when we come back thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live
[02:58:47.600 --> 02:58:55.640]  calm today looking back on 2012 we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from
[02:58:55.640 --> 02:58:59.600]  natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to
[02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:03.880]  the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy our hearts go out to

[02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:05.840]  network network
[03:00:05.840 --> 03:00:13.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[03:00:13.240 --> 03:00:20.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[03:00:20.880 --> 03:00:24.320]  Alex Jones
[03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:29.280]  ladies and gentlemen last week and earlier this week we played clips where
[03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:33.240]  White House advisors are telling top hedge fund managers that they're gonna
[03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:37.840]  devalue the dollar that's their plan and I mean I'm already seeing prices explode
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:42.720]  everywhere I don't know how people are paying their bills because you know I'm
[03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:46.040]  what you'd call upper-middle class or whatever I invest most of capital back
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:52.040]  in this operation but I mean I mean if these bills give me a sting and I'm
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:56.680]  wondering how working folks are making it I mean this is hellish and you really
[03:00:56.680 --> 03:01:00.600]  go places down you see less people and you see stores shutting down and we're
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:05.000]  in a depression I mean that's what's going on and people that bought gold at
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:08.320]  three hundred four hundred five hundred a thousand fifteen hundred when we told
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:12.240]  them to I didn't say do it as an investment they made out like bandits
[03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:15.640]  because they didn't listen to the globalist Soros and all the elites are
[03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:19.000]  buying gold Ted this is what I wanted to get you on how big is it that the
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:22.720]  Germans don't trust the private Federal Reserve and want their gold back and now
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:26.360]  all these other countries that signifies the creep towards the exits are
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:32.720]  accelerating well I mean if you have the Germans the central banks in Germany is
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:37.280]  saying we'd want our gold back I mean what does that mean they don't trust the
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:42.000]  United States they don't like the 85 billion dollars that we're making brand
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:46.520]  new money and putting into our economy every single month way too much stimulus
[03:01:46.520 --> 03:01:50.520]  it's obvious that the handwriting is on the wall paper is not going to hold
[03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:55.920]  value for the future gold is so is silver that's why they're asking for it
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:02:01.200]  it's obvious it's just simple you know the Rothschild's taking on huge amounts
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:05.160]  of gold and getting away from paper I mean these guys print the stuff and they
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:08.880]  don't want it I mean why it is the people of the United States it's like
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:12.320]  they're asleep at the switch or something it just doesn't make sense
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:17.040]  that they're sitting here accepting the economy that we have looking at the
[03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:21.040]  numbers unemployment numbers shooting up you know like you said Alex you're seeing
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:26.120]  stores closing down we're walking into a depression and and and half of the
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:29.720]  country thinks this president is so great because he's going to try to take
[03:02:29.720 --> 03:02:36.880]  away our guns and and and to me it just doesn't make sense when you see the the
[03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:41.880]  big traders in the marketplace getting away from paper money you better do the
[03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:45.480]  same because these guys can see what's going on the handwriting is on the wall
[03:02:45.480 --> 03:02:50.360]  besides the fact like you say Alex they would just as soon destroy the United
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:54.800]  States currency and force everybody to take their new world traded currency and
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:59.680]  lose the sovereign the sovereignty of this nation absolutely we've got some
[03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:03.480]  breaking news Ted just briefly here school officials confirm shooting in
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:08.560]  Atlanta middle school sounds like a gang related deal 14 year old shot and it
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:11.720]  goes on to say the parents even though the shootings been over a while are not
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:15.680]  allowed to pick up their children so the government's setting that precedent
[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:19.120]  where you can't get your kids and they teach them to get the fetal position to
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:22.680]  hopefully get a higher death count so they can take our guns that's Fox News
[03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:26.760]  Fox News calm reporting that and obviously drugs report calm will have it
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:31.120]  all have the latest at info Wars calm and prison planet TV Ted what about the
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:36.160]  two silver dollars for $72 with the two free films and the free book I mean
[03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:43.240]  that's like a $60 free retail value on top of the silver dollars at cost well
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:46.920]  that's the thing I mean if you were to buy the silver dollars from you straight
[03:03:46.920 --> 03:03:51.760]  you'd be paying over $78 for the two silver dollars plus you'd have to buy
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:58.600]  the postage which is at least 10 bucks you know so that particular deal is I
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:02.120]  mean nobody's got any nobody's got a deal like that out there in silver
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:06.880]  period this is the greatest way to get a couple pieces of silver in your hand
[03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:11.000]  especially if you can't afford to get into the marketplace in any great extent
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:15.520]  and you can use your credit card if you want to Alex it doesn't get better than
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:20.560]  that $72 for two silver dollars we all know that silver is trading in the 30s
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:25.280]  you're not going to be able to find that anywhere else plus the video I mean your
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:30.720]  Obama deception the American Dream you know the dishonest money by Joe Plummer
