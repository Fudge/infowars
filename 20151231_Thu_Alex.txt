[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:37.400 --> 00:43.520]  I'll do a Facebook mentions around midnight wow huge broadcasts lined up
[00:43.520 --> 00:48.640]  today we'll get into all of it after this special report that I tend to like to
[00:48.640 --> 00:52.620]  open the shows with John bound special reports if a big special report from
[00:52.620 --> 00:56.280]  jacari jackson on the TSA naked body scanners and more coming up today a
[00:56.280 --> 01:01.400]  bunch of big guests but the big push to come after free speech and guns is here
[01:01.400 --> 01:07.160]  it's all being formally announced this is just unprecedented we knew it was
[01:07.160 --> 01:09.840]  coming but it's still incredible to see it we'll cover it after the break but
[01:09.840 --> 01:14.880]  here's John bounds report while the decaying button paid for mainstream
[01:14.880 --> 01:20.000]  media dinosaurs pat themselves on the back for a job not well done 69
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.240]  journalists uncovering truth all over the globe were killed as 2015 comes to
[01:25.240 --> 01:30.200]  a close us news and world report reveals that 13 journalists died covering the
[01:30.200 --> 01:34.400]  events in Syria and of course who can forget the manipulated shock and all we
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.440]  all experienced during the gunning down of satirical free speech at the Charlie
[01:38.440 --> 01:42.600]  Hebdo headquarters in France in January where 12 people eight of them
[01:42.600 --> 01:47.880]  journalists were killed on August 26 the assault on free speech reared its
[01:47.880 --> 01:52.320]  ugly head in America went outside of Roanoke, Virginia a deluded and failed
[01:52.320 --> 01:56.360]  reporter allegedly gunned down another reporter and her cameraman while
[01:56.360 --> 02:01.400]  wounding the woman being interviewed and then later killed himself US news and
[02:01.400 --> 02:05.040]  world report writes the vast majority of journalists killed recovering some
[02:05.040 --> 02:12.120]  combination of political news 68% war 46% or human rights issues 39%
[02:12.120 --> 02:18.680]  journalists were also at risk covering culture 29% corruption 22% and crime
[02:18.680 --> 02:23.760]  19% and while the 69 journalists killed this year isn't a record number the
[02:23.760 --> 02:28.620]  growing intent to silence free speech is difficult to ignore and this is a
[02:28.620 --> 02:32.880]  reason why I came to see Alex you are one of the very few who are operating
[02:32.880 --> 02:38.720]  under this this under this theory to be an independent American and as in a big
[02:38.720 --> 02:43.960]  way if your calling is media fine if your calling is sports whatever it
[02:43.960 --> 02:50.360]  is but you've got to be the greatest you can be now now before this country is so
[02:50.360 --> 02:55.160]  completely right and we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a
[02:55.160 --> 02:59.800]  jar because that's what we're getting she's old and she's sick she's not a
[02:59.800 --> 03:04.280]  contender they're making her a contender with these propped up Saturday Night Live
[03:04.280 --> 03:08.840]  Things it's like a head on a stick and then on the today's show with the gun three
[03:08.840 --> 03:15.520]  ahead on a stick she is not a viable vibrant leader for this country of 300
[03:15.520 --> 03:22.520]  including the illegals 380 million Americans so the media is trying to put
[03:22.520 --> 03:27.360]  us to sleep if it continues to get consolidated to this degree and then
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.000]  we're go moving into the robots which you're so profound on and it's going to
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  get really ugly really fast there's already automated news sites Google
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.160]  News hello anybody they actually that the idiots reading that crap think there
[03:40.160 --> 03:45.200]  is actually a human there there is no human there you are being programmed to
[03:45.200 --> 03:51.000]  being automated I would say right now that the guys who control the press the
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.320]  ability to manipulate the press is much greater than ever and even the very
[03:56.320 --> 04:01.720]  good newspapers are you know staggering under the idea that it's just really
[04:01.720 --> 04:06.320]  hard to take everything at face value the current press secretary for the
[04:06.320 --> 04:10.080]  president of the United States may be a perfectly nice guy but he never worked
[04:10.080 --> 04:13.720]  as a journalist he was always a sort of a in the public relations business I'm
[04:13.720 --> 04:18.520]  not suggesting he's criminal or wrong but it we don't even have a journalist
[04:18.520 --> 04:23.920]  there so yes I would say things are worse off generally just in terms of day to
[04:23.920 --> 04:29.520]  day credibility it's just so much easier for the guys on top to get away with
[04:29.520 --> 04:34.520]  if not a falsehood just an incomplete answer or a non-answer when one should
[04:34.520 --> 04:39.680]  be issued 2016 is shaping up to be the year free speech will begin to be rated
[04:39.680 --> 04:44.400]  in ways too difficult to fathom as the globalist corporate credit backdoor
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.080]  trade deals spread like a cancer of domination unleashed by their hordes of
[04:49.080 --> 04:54.400]  copyright lawyers over what can and can't be published content John bound for
[04:54.400 --> 05:01.760]  info wars dot com another very powerful report Bill Cosby has been charged with
[05:01.760 --> 05:07.120]  drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea constant in 2004 crimes punishable by
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.080]  five to ten years in prison and a twenty five thousand dollar fine but what
[05:11.080 --> 05:15.560]  about the other bill former US president Bill Clinton whose past predatory
[05:15.560 --> 05:20.000]  behavior is once again in the spotlight after Hillary tried unsuccessfully to
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.840]  play the sexism card against Trump for years Bill Cosby continued raking in
[05:24.840 --> 05:28.680]  millions while the media covered up his dirt in order to preserve his legacy
[05:28.680 --> 05:32.760]  but even after exposing years of predatory sexual behavior Bill Clinton
[05:32.760 --> 05:36.880]  remains a highly revered member of the Democratic Party pulling in tens of
[05:36.880 --> 05:41.240]  millions of dollars in speaking fees while Hillary was secretary of state for
[05:41.240 --> 05:45.240]  someone running a campaign on female empowerment Hillary can't seem to shake

[08:40.600 --> 09:07.760]  ladies and gentlemen it is the final transmission and I'm gonna be
[09:07.760 --> 09:14.240]  conducting here in this chair in 2015 hard to believe that we're hurdling
[09:14.240 --> 09:22.000]  into 2016 have a bunch of guests joining us today it's all gonna be
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.920]  extremely informative the big theme though that is rearing its ugly head
[09:26.920 --> 09:38.400]  not just here but across the world is the fact that there is a concerted
[09:38.400 --> 09:48.680]  organized focused continued attack on free speech and systems of free speech
[09:48.680 --> 09:54.320]  being directed by global corporate interest they are making their move in
[09:54.320 --> 10:04.480]  a big way right now there is a huge offensive and that's because the system
[10:04.480 --> 10:11.320]  is losing what little bit of credibility they had those fumes are now
[10:11.320 --> 10:20.720]  disappearing look at the report out today from USA today TV the old king of
[10:20.720 --> 10:32.840]  u.s. politics faces mortality that's a nice way of saying faces death I don't
[10:32.840 --> 10:36.960]  want to say that mainstream media is dead
[10:40.400 --> 10:45.600]  because it's never really been alive it's been a tool of disinformation from
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.840]  the beginning but if you talk about being dominant when it comes to
[10:50.840 --> 10:56.400]  information and dumbing the people down it's been changed so we call it the
[10:56.400 --> 11:02.840]  dinosaur media that's a good name for it because the dinosaurs you know we're
[11:02.840 --> 11:09.440]  told are extinct but we still have the crocodile the alligator things like
[11:09.440 --> 11:14.760]  that in the crocodile family that supposedly is even older than the dinosaur
[11:14.760 --> 11:24.360]  family but when we look at mainstream media it's only powerful it only comes
[11:24.360 --> 11:32.760]  alive on blue moon events big military operations stock market crashes things
[11:32.760 --> 11:37.440]  like that yes they have big viewerships yes they can still occasionally push
[11:37.440 --> 11:44.560]  narratives and dictate outcomes but they're losing even that blue moon
[11:44.560 --> 11:55.920]  power because they are so ultra discredited that even though big audiences
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.200]  occasionally tune in the rest of time they are flat-lined we're talking
[12:00.200 --> 12:07.000]  hundred thousand viewers 200,000 viewers on CNN same thing MSNBC Fox has gone
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.080]  from you know six seven million down to a couple million on its biggest shows
[12:10.080 --> 12:17.440]  it's dying as well but not dead yet and they go on to admit it is the internet
[12:17.440 --> 12:21.000]  and it is what the candidates say themselves and it's what the people
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.760]  say themselves it is not anything the mainstream media says the mainstream
[12:25.760 --> 12:32.120]  media could have stayed somewhat dominant but it's gone so extreme when it
[12:32.120 --> 12:38.080]  comes to disinformation and lies in an attempt to hang on it has gone so far
[12:38.080 --> 12:45.120]  in distorting and twisting that people don't believe it when they come out and
[12:45.120 --> 12:50.440]  say what the temperature is they don't believe it when they say what's
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.160]  happening with the stock market they don't believe any of it because they
[12:54.160 --> 12:57.840]  may not be the general public sophisticated enough to know what
[12:57.840 --> 13:00.720]  they're being lied to about but they just don't believe anything they're
[13:00.720 --> 13:07.120]  being told that's a very important first phase now we can get in there and start
[13:07.120 --> 13:13.400]  not telling people how to think not spoon feeding them garbage but actually
[13:13.400 --> 13:18.040]  showing them the paradigms and how the world works and telling them the hat
[13:18.040 --> 13:24.840]  tricks of the magician of the sorcerers of the technocrats of those that would
[13:24.840 --> 13:29.840]  control reality of those that would be history's actors we're not feeding
[13:29.840 --> 13:35.600]  people fish we're showing them how to fish we're not telling people what to
[13:35.600 --> 13:39.400]  think we're simply saying this is what we see this is historically what's
[13:39.400 --> 13:43.120]  happened before here's global of stone admissions they write all these books and
[13:43.120 --> 13:49.400]  white papers they think you're too dumb to go and research it for yourself
[13:51.880 --> 13:58.920]  they think that you won't learn how to think they think that you'll be an
[13:58.920 --> 14:04.920]  expert on the sitcoms the dramas the entertainment the fantasy football the
[14:04.920 --> 14:09.280]  average person is not even really dumb they're just experts on stupid stuff that
[14:09.280 --> 14:14.240]  isn't effective that isn't based in the real world that is artificial creations
[14:14.240 --> 14:22.120]  of this corrupt system it'd be like being an expert ditch digger is that
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.440]  really going to make you successful and independent no you're never going to
[14:26.440 --> 14:29.760]  make more than ten dollars an hour
[14:29.960 --> 14:34.520]  well they teach you stuff even less effective than ditch digging how to be
[14:34.520 --> 14:42.360]  cool on you know online group games how to buy real fictional Lamborghinis I
[14:42.360 --> 14:47.040]  say real this is real to them with real money and to be a movie star in these
[14:47.040 --> 14:55.160]  different second-life video games oh that's a money well spent they need you
[14:55.160 --> 14:59.720]  to live in the fantasy land and sleep so while you're sleeping they take over the
[14:59.720 --> 15:03.560]  kingdom and they've done a pretty good job of running off with everything but
[15:03.560 --> 15:09.960]  if there's still a percentage of people awake and they're trying this this this
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.520]  this mesmerization game where they look at us with straight faces and say there
[15:14.520 --> 15:19.600]  is no world government there is no tyranny fluoride is good for you vaccines
[15:19.600 --> 15:26.520]  never hurt anybody folks don't buy it anymore and there's a lot more awake
[15:26.520 --> 15:32.080]  people than there are globalist controllers and the zombies are running
[15:32.080 --> 15:39.960]  around like lobotomized gerbils are just sad victims of all of this and we
[15:39.960 --> 15:45.320]  should never dare laugh at them because is this technotronic era gets more and
[15:45.320 --> 15:53.320]  more tyrannical is it becomes more oppressive the smartest and most
[15:53.320 --> 15:57.200]  resistant of us are gonna have to fight to maintain our will and our
[15:57.200 --> 16:03.120]  consciousness this is the great challenge the great animating contest and
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.720]  they are getting ready I told you 2016 was hammerfall it's all over mainstream
[16:08.720 --> 16:12.120]  news they're blowing the trumpets that it's inevitable we're coming with
[16:12.120 --> 16:16.120]  carbon taxes we're coming for your guns we're coming for your free speech we're
[16:16.120 --> 16:21.400]  coming with forced inoculations we're coming to sexualize your children at
[16:21.400 --> 16:28.960]  age five age age four in no child left behind I mean it is on Obama has told
[16:28.960 --> 16:35.560]  politico hammerfall next week the beginning of executive orders against
[16:35.560 --> 16:40.120]  the guns I predict the first he says this is a long string of them I predict
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.320]  the first will sound reasonable and will not be the most draconian the second
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.000]  will not be as draconian but a little bit more and within a month or two of
[16:49.000 --> 16:55.920]  next year he is going to come out nationwide with an executive order like
[16:55.920 --> 17:00.040]  the California law where they just feel like with an anonymous tip coming
[17:00.040 --> 17:04.320]  and confiscating your guns they're gone you're then drug off to a Soviet style
[17:04.320 --> 17:15.920]  psychological evaluation get ready folks it's here the good news is the enemy is
[17:15.920 --> 17:21.240]  on fire floundering with their rudders shot off and if we just realize the power
[17:21.240 --> 17:25.560]  the Liberty movement has and if we engage in the info war and expose what
[17:25.560 --> 17:29.520]  they're doing we can win they have admittedly as of last year activated the
[17:29.520 --> 17:35.600]  central intelligence agency the FBI and a bunch of other foreign think tank PR
[17:35.600 --> 17:44.680]  groups to engage in massive high-tech co-intel pro in fighting disinfo is all
[17:44.680 --> 17:49.240]  sorts of attacks on the Liberty movement from within and that is going to go
[17:49.240 --> 17:56.000]  into high gear next year so get ready for that you'll be trying to defend the
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.040]  Second Amendment or defend the borders or defend sovereignty and you're just
[17:59.040 --> 18:03.280]  going to see disturbances start up no matter how small your website is or

[18:25.840 --> 18:29.920]  machines coming in against Liberty so I'm telling you ignore all the side chatter
[18:29.920 --> 18:33.880]  folks and realize those big ships coming in that's the main attack the

[18:43.120 --> 18:46.600]  hitting everybody they're gonna try to divide and conquer operations just like
[18:46.600 --> 18:51.120]  they do when they take over a third world country with the opposition don't
[18:51.120 --> 18:54.360]  listen to the propaganda don't listen to the fact they say we're losing don't

[24:52.280 --> 24:57.320]  six years ago I was out in the hill country out by Wemberley at a camp out
[24:57.320 --> 25:09.640]  with my son at a birthday party and I was down by the creek and I'd already
[25:09.640 --> 25:15.160]  been told by the folks that were putting on the party on their acreage that oh
[25:15.160 --> 25:18.320]  yeah John Wayne's son lives next door but they're they're moving out in a month
[25:18.320 --> 25:22.440]  to Costa Rica they're leaving the United States and they say especially the last
[25:22.440 --> 25:26.560]  time we get out of here so then I'm down there and up by the creek like a day
[25:26.560 --> 25:33.840]  later we're there for two days here comes John Wayne's son and I'm like looking
[25:33.840 --> 25:39.800]  looks like John Wayne was like a Hispanic John Wayne and I said I hear
[25:39.800 --> 25:42.160]  you're leaving he goes yeah the word is you don't get out of here in a year or
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.560]  two you won't be able to get out with your money or anything I said really
[25:46.560 --> 25:48.840]  goes yeah that's what all the rich people and all the elites are doing
[25:48.840 --> 25:51.720]  they're leaving and I've been hearing that from billionaires and people too you
[25:51.720 --> 25:55.920]  know now it's all over the news I mean that's how scary all this is folks this
[25:55.920 --> 26:00.880]  isn't a game this is the totalitarian takeover of America Al Gore said two
[26:00.880 --> 26:06.240]  years ago we need an Arab Spring in America and they're bringing in an Arab
[26:06.240 --> 26:15.480]  Spring with the radical left and the Black Lives Matter movement to start a
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.960]  civil war in this country that's not rhetoric folks that's what they're
[26:19.960 --> 26:25.760]  planning and we're trying to stop it and people say well black lives matter has
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.480]  some good points and you know since this let's get past all that it's George
[26:30.480 --> 26:36.240]  Soros run of course it's gonna have some legitimate points of course there's
[26:36.240 --> 26:40.960]  some problems with police there's problems all over the place that's pull
[26:40.960 --> 26:45.080]  up the number of people shot and killed by police a year it varies but it's one
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.640]  of the rarest ways to die by their horrible crazy police some of them
[26:48.640 --> 26:52.680]  absolutely is the government getting too much power and that trickles down
[26:52.680 --> 26:58.800]  absolutely but the country is being set up for war with Russia our
[26:58.800 --> 27:04.480]  government's backing al Qaeda to murder hundreds of thousands of people and the
[27:04.480 --> 27:08.880]  stinking Democratic Party is run by a bunch of race-baiting crazies trying to
[27:08.880 --> 27:16.280]  try to race war number of people killed by US police in 2015 at 1,000 yeah I was
[27:16.280 --> 27:21.040]  about to say it's like a thousand one hundred or so every year and most of
[27:21.040 --> 27:24.680]  them are in shootouts with the police I mean you're talking ninety percent are
[27:24.680 --> 27:29.600]  totally justified and yeah there are then maybe a hundred maybe two hundred
[27:29.600 --> 27:34.440]  really bad things that happen but I mean use that again they're aborting half
[27:34.440 --> 27:39.160]  the black people but I can't get black people to be upset about it or white
[27:39.160 --> 27:44.160]  people because MSNBC said it's a wonderful thing so you kill millions of
[27:44.160 --> 27:49.800]  blacks every year that's wonderful but you kill 20 or 30 of them it's like the
[27:49.800 --> 27:55.600]  end of the world one man dies it's a tragedy ten thousand died statistic just
[27:55.600 --> 28:04.760]  all of us right and it just goes on and on the reason I bring up John Wayne is
[28:04.760 --> 28:10.960]  John Wayne's daughter endorses Trump I am humbly at your service my dad I am

[33:39.240 --> 33:43.760]  get wound up I end up not covering a lot of them so let me just attempt to read
[33:43.760 --> 33:48.120]  you some of these headlines look at this one John Wayne's daughter endorses
[33:48.120 --> 33:52.040]  Trump I am humbly at your service my dad I'm sure we're very proud of Mr.
[33:52.040 --> 33:59.600]  Trump Bill Cosby's lawyer has faith in justice system I mean look whether he
[33:59.600 --> 34:02.680]  did all this or not I think the things questionable on both sides I think we
[34:02.680 --> 34:08.280]  did was unethical there's obviously something going on there but but in so
[34:08.280 --> 34:12.440]  many of the cases it's like I was a playboy girl and I you know went out with
[34:12.440 --> 34:16.200]  him 15 times and I think he used to drug me I don't know what happened when I
[34:16.200 --> 34:21.280]  went to bedroom with him I mean just give me a break give me a break I just
[34:21.280 --> 34:25.040]  kept going to the hotel room with him and he'd say you take this pill and I do
[34:25.040 --> 34:28.640]  it not even know what the pill did that will now graduate into what we're
[34:28.640 --> 34:32.600]  hearing about date rape worry I had five vodkas and then I didn't know what
[34:32.600 --> 34:38.000]  happened since caveman times men have been like drink the mead female I mean
[34:38.000 --> 34:46.960]  I it's just it's dangerous where all this is going and I mean the guy actually
[34:46.960 --> 34:51.120]  does look like a toad I mean I have to say Cosby doesn't look too happy in
[34:51.120 --> 34:55.920]  these photographs and I shouldn't be laughing about it but he's now taken the
[34:55.920 --> 35:02.960]  form of a muppet and he was acting like he was blind when they let him in I mean
[35:02.960 --> 35:06.720]  I don't know what's going on it's just I'm sure some of these women are telling
[35:06.720 --> 35:11.200]  the truth some of the others I watched him on TV and they look like some of the
[35:11.200 --> 35:16.880]  biggest BS artists I've ever seen in my life and that's just my opinion and it
[35:16.880 --> 35:20.400]  keeps coming out in statistics that around half of the rape allegations made
[35:20.400 --> 35:24.080]  in this country are fake we're all told there's this rape culture let me tell
[35:24.080 --> 35:28.120]  you where there's a rape culture with the hundreds of thousands of invaded
[35:28.120 --> 35:34.000]  Sunni radicals that have come in to Iraq and Syria that are running around
[35:34.000 --> 35:39.200]  raping and murdering everyone who say the Quran gives them the authorization to
[35:39.200 --> 35:46.280]  rape girls as young as six years of age well I don't need the Quran to tell me
[35:46.280 --> 35:50.840]  you need to have your head beaten in with a baseball bat if you talk like that
[35:50.840 --> 35:56.920]  or want to do things like that I mean this is sick and our media does
[35:56.920 --> 36:00.840]  everything it can to cover this up and all these leftist outlets are attacking
[36:00.840 --> 36:06.920]  me Alex Jones is Islamophobic Alex Jones hates Muslims Alex Jones is a
[36:06.920 --> 36:12.480]  bigot I am a bigot against a radical form of Islam that puts hoods over women's
[36:12.480 --> 36:17.840]  heads cuts their genitals off mutilates them uses them as slaves each people's
[36:17.840 --> 36:22.480]  hearts murders every Christian they get a hold of and run around with its nine
[36:22.480 --> 36:26.920]  year old boys blowing prisoners heads off and sawing people's heads off yes
[36:26.920 --> 36:32.240]  yes I don't like it I discriminate against it yes just like I would
[36:32.240 --> 36:35.880]  discriminate against a dead cat on the side of the road if someone said let's
[36:35.880 --> 36:40.560]  go fry up this maggot-covered cat my nose would discriminate the stinking
[36:40.560 --> 36:50.720]  flesh and I'd say I don't eat roadkill thank you very much so that's what
[36:50.720 --> 36:56.640]  they're doing I'm sorry I've got the two stories here but while we're busy hating
[36:56.640 --> 36:59.800]  on Bill Cosby
[37:01.960 --> 37:10.080]  while we're busy going after the king of the toads all Hades is breaking loose
[37:10.080 --> 37:16.520]  around the world the stock market is going way down today sour on final day
[37:16.520 --> 37:23.880]  of 2015 derivatives are way bigger than they were in 2008 there's all sorts of
[37:23.880 --> 37:31.080]  wars breaking out and you would think Donald Trump was the Antichrist for
[37:31.080 --> 37:34.440]  saying until they start checking people's visas and not letting people in
[37:34.440 --> 37:39.400]  from terrorist areas we have to shut off all Muslims coming in until Congress
[37:39.400 --> 37:43.120]  does an investigation and starts vetting these people just like they bring
[37:43.120 --> 37:46.600]  illegals in from all over the world to say oh we got a plane loaded JFK from
[37:46.600 --> 37:53.640]  Mexico and the customs agents are told and they called the media and then it
[37:53.640 --> 38:00.120]  even came out in CBS and NBC News imagine they went and whistle blow they said a
[38:00.120 --> 38:05.600]  plane with a hundred and fifty-something people on it landed there's the daily
[38:05.600 --> 38:10.720]  news on flight from Mexico allowed to skip customs leave JFK airport just hey
[38:10.720 --> 38:14.960]  you know what we've been ordered just let you in you're from Mexico just come
[38:14.960 --> 38:19.160]  on in Trump's like something's got to be done right now I mean imagine if
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.280]  suddenly the president of Mexico just said we're not gonna check anybody when
[38:22.280 --> 38:28.120]  they come in you just land from anywhere you can just come across and then a guy
[38:28.120 --> 38:31.720]  running for president said until the president stops this and until we know
[38:31.720 --> 38:35.640]  what's happening no one comes in shut the borders until you put security back
[38:35.640 --> 38:43.880]  in they'd say that's just no brainer it's like you you're cooking dinner and
[38:43.880 --> 38:48.600]  you forget and the stoves on fire and then there's fire shooting up you go
[38:48.600 --> 38:53.200]  turn it off and you go get the fire extinguisher and you spray everything
[38:53.200 --> 38:56.880]  until the fire is extinguished you don't go maybe you're discriminating against
[38:56.880 --> 39:00.720]  the fish you were frying in the pan don't get with a fire extinguisher because
[39:00.720 --> 39:06.600]  you hate fish no you don't hate fish you want the fire to stop you don't hate
[39:06.600 --> 39:11.920]  people from the Middle East but you don't Obama won't let Christians in
[39:11.920 --> 39:17.480]  Christians are like 12% they were 20% of the population in Syria they're trying
[39:17.480 --> 39:22.120]  to get here our government won't let them in they'll bring in thousands of
[39:22.120 --> 39:28.040]  Muslims none of them she I all of them Sunni and then they'll have for every
[39:28.040 --> 39:31.400]  200 something there's a metric I've noticed this in the news they'll go okay
[39:31.400 --> 39:41.360]  one Christian 31 Christians versus 200 2149 Muslims just 1% of Syrian refugees
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.960]  accepted by Obama administration in 2015 were Christians 98% were Muslim and
[39:45.960 --> 40:00.080]  almost all of them were Sunni you Sherpers invaders ous landers outlanders
[40:03.560 --> 40:10.680]  how's that for everybody out there and then England the British government is
[40:10.680 --> 40:14.640]  looking in the UK at banning Donald Trump as a public menace from entering
[40:14.640 --> 40:21.200]  Britannia interfering in our elections trying to demonize someone who has
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.880]  massive business holdings in the UK huge hotels golf courses you name it these
[40:25.880 --> 40:39.040]  are sanctions against him now you really know he's good don't you and he's got
[40:39.040 --> 40:45.280]  people advising him that are hardcore and full-wars listeners who are hardcore
[40:45.280 --> 40:56.160]  people in the Nixon and Reagan and Bush 41 administrations serious people who
[40:56.160 --> 40:59.000]  don't want to see this country destroyed there is an internal battle in the
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.160]  government folks that's why all these generals are going public by Cyhurst came
[41:02.160 --> 41:08.640]  on the show yesterday this is a soft coup against the globalist takeover there
[41:08.640 --> 41:15.080]  is a counter coup going on Cyhurst agreed pull a surprise winner greatest
[41:15.080 --> 41:20.200]  living journalist with this show yesterday knowing full well who we are
[41:20.200 --> 41:30.000]  came on to agree with us and to go over the evidence the military has said no
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.320]  you want to give weapons to ISIS we're just going to break them and they
[41:36.320 --> 41:41.120]  deliver them broken weapons that's why ISIS will bitch on these things and go
[41:41.120 --> 41:49.880]  hang grenades without the detonators you know AR-15s without the firing pins and
[41:49.880 --> 41:53.280]  so when the military is flying over there and the contractors are with these
[41:53.280 --> 41:59.560]  big C-130s full of weapons they sit there on the whole flight sabotaging it
[41:59.560 --> 42:05.560]  well they follow their orders but they sabotage it that's going on at the
[42:05.560 --> 42:13.320]  grassroots level you should I only got ever seen such a legitimate resistance
[42:13.320 --> 42:18.800]  this isn't mutiny if you're on board an aircraft a 777 say and a guy goes you
[42:18.800 --> 42:23.000]  know hello hello hello and the name of all is great I will kill all of you if
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.040]  you did not do as I say and back in the 70s and 80s they would actually go put
[42:26.040 --> 42:29.280]  on the outfit of the captain a lot of times because they found everybody
[42:29.280 --> 42:34.000]  submitted when they saw the uniform would it be mutiny to fight back against a
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.600]  hijacker who put the captain's uniform on you ask a trendy they say
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.280]  absolutely check your white privilege at the door and hope that Habib saw as your
[42:42.280 --> 42:46.680]  head off I'm not kidding there's a death wish for these people no the guy
[42:46.680 --> 42:53.040]  wearing the uniform isn't the president he's a front man a political correctness
[42:53.040 --> 42:58.280]  where they condition us to never disagree with a quote minority whether
[42:58.280 --> 43:01.520]  you're a minority or whether you're white whatever whites are now a minority
[43:01.520 --> 43:06.320]  in almost every area minority worldwide there's really about 7% whites
[43:06.320 --> 43:10.640]  worldwide the people identifying as white maybe 9% okay but the point is is
[43:10.640 --> 43:15.160]  that I know whites are evil it's just terrible and of course it's corrupt white
[43:15.160 --> 43:17.800]  people using that narrative to manipulate things and create divide and
[43:17.800 --> 43:24.200]  conquer but because we have a quote black president doesn't act or behave like
[43:24.200 --> 43:36.160]  any black people I ever knew and it's just sick it's totally absolutely
[43:36.160 --> 43:46.680]  completely sick to the bedrock bottom core the attempted crucifixion of Donald
[43:46.680 --> 43:49.400]  Trump and I want to say something here that is one of the most important things
[43:49.400 --> 43:52.200]  I've ever said so please listen to me very very carefully because I know a lot
[43:52.200 --> 43:59.280]  of it gets lost in the ranting even if you hate Donald Trump and you are a
[43:59.280 --> 44:05.520]  committed Bernie Sanders communist do you really think you should be banned
[44:05.520 --> 44:08.600]  from going to the UK do you really think they should be in the newspapers
[44:08.600 --> 44:12.480]  talking about disqualifying him because the establishment says he's not
[44:12.480 --> 44:22.280]  presidential material this is the very ether the very atmosphere the very
[44:22.280 --> 44:31.560]  spectrum of abject complete oppression and bar cage tyranny it is the anti
[44:31.560 --> 44:39.400]  liberty and I have a stack of news here where they're coming out for free speech
[44:39.400 --> 44:44.600]  here and everywhere else and it's being a victorially called for because the
[44:44.600 --> 44:49.600]  totalitarians cannot trump our information so whether Trump is an
[44:49.600 --> 44:53.960]  angel a devil or somewhere in between like most of us the establishment
[44:53.960 --> 45:02.400]  truly wants him destroyed and is coming after him right now and if they can
[45:02.400 --> 45:06.040]  shut him down it'll be another major victory for these people but it's
[45:06.040 --> 45:10.840]  causing more people to go to the cause it's causing more people to wake up and
[45:10.840 --> 45:18.880]  we have two very powerful movements in collision course already colliding with
[45:18.880 --> 45:26.040]  each other as we speak and it's going to be explosive so I hope you're not just
[45:26.040 --> 45:29.880]  a spectator during these next few months and next year or so because this is
[45:29.880 --> 45:37.240]  quite a time to be alive and Trump is really aggressively fighting back seeing
[45:37.240 --> 45:41.600]  how dare you claim I'm a sexist Hillary and play sex card on me with women when
[45:41.600 --> 45:48.400]  your husband has settled rape cases and again the move as I told you is they're
[45:48.400 --> 45:52.560]  going to go after the Clintons and this is the proof that they're at war with
[45:52.560 --> 46:00.840]  them because this is coffin nails politically for the Clintons if they
[46:00.840 --> 46:05.520]  want to get tangled up with it and they're ready to go after the bushes with
[46:05.520 --> 46:18.280]  9-11 Trump is ready if you want to take that bait and you want to go after him
[46:18.280 --> 46:24.920]  for that he's ready and you got pretty good control your people don't shit
[46:24.920 --> 46:29.080]  your control press I mean that you know that the dogs got out of the fence for a
[46:29.080 --> 46:32.560]  little bit to go after this when Trump came on but you called him right back in
[46:32.560 --> 46:40.000]  about four hours it went from 3,000 plus stories to none the next day that is
[46:40.000 --> 46:47.480]  control boy we got some controlled press in this country look at this headline
[46:47.480 --> 46:51.400]  government considering banning Donald Trump there's another one Google and the
[46:51.400 --> 46:56.600]  Trump free internet and that's a good headline but I'm gonna change demos
[46:56.600 --> 47:03.040]  headline Google implements systems to censor Trump or Google now censoring
[47:03.040 --> 47:07.680]  Trump from internet that's really what it is filtering out front runner will do
[47:07.680 --> 47:11.200]  nothing to stop his meteoric rise and then it goes through how they admit that
[47:11.200 --> 47:13.960]  they are filtering him out and driving him down and putting negative stuff at
[47:13.960 --> 47:20.160]  the top I mean that is just unbelievable shame on Google oh but other
[47:20.160 --> 47:25.520]  countries are doing it as well Vietnam warns of toxic web use ahead of party
[47:25.520 --> 47:31.800]  shakeup Reuters see our media will report on censorship in China or
[47:31.800 --> 47:37.560]  censorship in Vietnam or milder forms in Russia oh but when it's going on here
[47:37.560 --> 47:45.800]  it's like oh it's good when it happens here and I had my article in here where
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.240]  media looks to ban Trump here in the US I have another article they're openly
[47:50.240 --> 47:54.120]  saying it'll Trump it needs to be disqualified they're openly now floating
[47:54.120 --> 48:00.040]  that but but meanwhile while Trump's being demonized up to 34 million blank
[48:00.040 --> 48:05.000]  green cards and work pimp permits to be ordered ahead of Obama illegal immigrant
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.280]  amnesty daily mail and of course a year ago this came out and then they withdrew
[48:09.280 --> 48:13.680]  the request but Congress was requested for this the funding and now it's back
[48:13.680 --> 48:19.840]  so just blank green cards oh but we've all got to give our rights up to
[48:19.840 --> 48:25.080]  terrorists are about to hit a cinematic agents nav pakistanis with terrorist
[48:25.080 --> 48:29.960]  connections crossing us border washington times
[48:29.960 --> 48:36.560]  Trump I know words I have the best words Obama is stupid I want to go to
[48:36.560 --> 48:41.680]  some of those clips here in just a moment Barack Obama confirms a pretty
[48:41.680 --> 48:45.480]  sizable percent of the world leaders are quote out of their minds takes one to
[48:45.480 --> 48:50.840]  no one doesn't it you power mad nut Brussels cancels New Year's fireworks
[48:50.840 --> 48:54.200]  through to terror threat oh yeah Parisians aren't gonna celebrate in Paris
[48:54.200 --> 48:57.520]  New Year's cuz they're worried about terrorists I mean talk about giving in
[48:57.520 --> 49:01.960]  talk about just groveling in fear with the government's greasing the skids oh
[49:01.960 --> 49:09.520]  yes don't come out they're gonna get you it says legitimate is saying don't go
[49:09.520 --> 49:13.600]  out the police are gonna kill you the police kill about a thousand people a
[49:13.600 --> 49:19.480]  year 90 plus percent of its legitimate what's corrupt is the courts and the
[49:19.480 --> 49:23.280]  system running the police to turn them into code enforcers and harassers of the
[49:23.280 --> 49:27.040]  people and debt collectors and it's terrible and it's a surveillance state
[49:27.040 --> 49:31.560]  but they're the lowest level of it it's our fault for letting Congress have the
[49:31.560 --> 49:36.360]  TSA do this and our borders open it's a scapegoat they want to have a scapegoat
[49:36.360 --> 49:40.280]  revolution not against the foreign banks that took the country over but
[49:40.280 --> 49:43.720]  against local government that's their admitted plan I just keep going back to
[49:43.720 --> 49:51.200]  that in the new year because all hell is gonna break close next year and they're
[49:51.200 --> 49:54.200]  gonna get the police so wound up and so crazed when cops are getting killed
[49:54.200 --> 49:59.640]  every day that they're gonna follow whatever global orders they get in the
[49:59.640 --> 50:04.640]  name of stopping it all that's why we're there targeting that narrative with the
[50:04.640 --> 50:07.880]  truth the police are checking it they're looking at it they're finding out we're
[50:07.880 --> 50:11.240]  accurate they already know pretty much everything we're saying is accurate on
[50:11.240 --> 50:14.480]  their own without even me saying it but we're just putting it all together and
[50:14.480 --> 50:18.840]  let me tell you we see for miles and miles we know what we're talking about
[50:18.840 --> 50:23.080]  and we are actively battling every globalist operation at point-blank
[50:23.080 --> 50:27.580]  range I mean I'm just out here hair on fire folks swords in both hands just
[50:27.580 --> 50:32.800]  hacking the enemy doesn't mean we got all the answers doesn't mean we're not
[50:32.800 --> 50:36.200]  gonna fall down doesn't mean we may not be destroyed but we're in the fight you
[50:36.200 --> 50:39.080]  better believe it and when you know the people to get involved the fight right
[50:39.080 --> 50:44.240]  now because this is what Al Gore and George Soros promised their globalist

[55:29.720 --> 55:35.240]  Hillary the New Yorker magazine asked so here's Donald Trump firing a major
[55:35.240 --> 55:41.040]  shot across the bow the Clinton crime family you know Hillary said well I'd
[55:41.040 --> 55:45.800]  like to run against Trump believe me this poor Chuck Todd meet the press he's
[55:45.800 --> 55:50.280]  his show is dying and he keeps saying do it do it but I never liked it you know
[55:50.280 --> 55:53.800]  I just he never treated me fairly so I do a show he gets the highest ratings
[55:53.800 --> 55:57.920]  he's had in years he went from like believe me I won't even give you the
[55:57.920 --> 56:02.520]  numbers they were massive the numbers right I saved his life and then he goes
[56:02.520 --> 56:08.760]  here it glint and said that she would most like to run against Donald Trump and
[56:08.760 --> 56:15.920]  yes and they're looking forward to trust me the last person she's already gotten
[56:15.920 --> 56:20.760]  a dose last night you agree she had a tough night she had a tough night she
[56:20.760 --> 56:26.960]  had a tough night looking at the beauty pageant okay so Hillary Clinton said and
[56:26.960 --> 56:30.800]  here's Chuck Todd and he's a nice guy I'm not trying to knock him please don't
[56:30.800 --> 56:36.720]  be insulted Chuck but she says she doesn't like him but he doesn't keep me
[56:36.720 --> 56:41.400]  right so he goes the Clinton campaign said they'd most like to run against
[56:41.400 --> 56:46.320]  Trump like I'm some kind of a sap so calm I say Chuck let me explain something
[56:46.320 --> 56:50.080]  when they say they want to run against me that means they don't want to run
[56:50.080 --> 56:54.320]  against me do you understand that do you understand it's reverse psychology they
[56:54.320 --> 56:58.920]  say they want to run against me first of all I'm winning and tied in the polls
[56:58.920 --> 57:02.920]  now and I haven't even hit her yet but look at what happened to all the guys I
[57:02.920 --> 57:08.440]  hit their guns oh they're gone or they're failing badly okay and they'll be gone
[57:08.440 --> 57:15.640]  but Hillary Clinton think of it I say so Chuck report it like properly trust me
[57:15.640 --> 57:20.600]  they don't want to run against Trump the last thing she wants in her whole life
[57:20.600 --> 57:26.600]  is this was only I did this in like 15 minutes what happened to them because the
[57:26.600 --> 57:30.360]  husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husband's
[57:30.360 --> 57:41.160]  one of the great abuses of the world give me a break he is such a maniac I
[57:41.160 --> 57:48.440]  just I love Donald Trump I'm sold touches I can't help it I mean the secret
[57:48.440 --> 57:51.640]  service thinks he's gonna get shot any moment by the way I mean they are just

[57:57.240 --> 58:02.280]  really got guts and there's that quote from full metal jacket private Joker
[58:02.280 --> 58:06.480]  silly and he's ignorant but he's got guts and guts is enough well Trump's not
[58:06.480 --> 58:11.160]  silly or ignorant he does some wild things because he's real and you know I
[58:11.160 --> 58:14.120]  questioned it four or five months ago but now on the inside baseball and
[58:14.120 --> 58:19.000]  watching them openly come after him and the money from both parties coming in
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.840]  against him I mean they see him as a major threat and all the sniveling

[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.120]  and stop it till they do something no he's the worst person ever he's up
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:07.480]  thinking you believe let me tell you the craziest thing I heard Trump said when
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.120]  the submarines go under the water they should close the portal hatch on the
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:17.720]  top are you kidding oh yeah he then said you shouldn't put a gun to your head
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:23.320]  with loaded bullets and pull the trigger oh my gosh oh it gets worse Trump said
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.080]  that if you smoke 10 packs of cigarettes a day for 50 years you might get
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:32.040]  lung cancer oh my goodness did you hear the really weird one he said the sun
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:38.000]  came up this morning oh my gosh I mean I'm convinced that if you went out there
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.880]  and told trendies to sign a petition to make the sun not come up the morning
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.400]  because Obama said so are you for the Sun are you racist you know it's yellow
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.280]  it's not black they would probably sign a petition to announce that the Sun
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:54.520]  should be the word Sun should be banned after all it's Sun is as you in Sun is
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.840]  so in it's kind of like saying the Sun God's male like male sunlight fertilizes
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:07.400]  the planet oh my gosh those sexes Egyptians ban it excuse me let me get
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.760]  back to serious issues here is another clip Donald Trump I know words I have
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:19.120]  the best words Obama is stupid let's play that clip the world has blown up
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:25.240]  around Barack Obama now I don't know if you saw his recent release they were
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.520]  talking about the Department of State State Department and they said very
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.080]  strongly you know the things that they've done well they couldn't find it
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.280]  and because what have they done that's good and they said bring in peace to
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:45.840]  Syria so instead of saying they made a mistake call it a typo they made a
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.600]  mistake they're trying to justify well we meant we're working on it can you
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:54.040]  believe bringing peace to Syria the world is blowing up the migration to
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:59.320]  Syria they say one of their achievements for the years bringing peace to Syria
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.840]  and the whole world's talking about it's it's the level of stupidity is
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.600]  incredible I'm telling you I used to use the word incompetent now it just comes
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:12.960]  stupid I went to an Ivy League school I'm very highly educated I know words I
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.080]  have the best words I have them but there's no better words than stupid
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:33.080]  that's right there's no there's no word like that I don't like to use of the
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.120]  Lord's name in vain and I shouldn't but I have trouble I don't even see it when

[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:44.240]  Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones. Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:53.120]  3 p.m. four hours of hard core talk radio slash news analysis coming to you.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:09:01.360]  In the old-fashioned TV transmission as well. All right we're to start. There is
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.920]  so much here. I want to air a special report Jacari Jackson did about the
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.320]  return of the naked body scanners. Opting out is because lawsuits got
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.640]  filed doing it to children is illegal taking naked images of children should
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.000]  not tell you is illegal that's why courthouses nationwide that have the
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:27.840]  naked body scanners have similar systems and with those systems they have those
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:33.720]  images it is the production of child pornography and that's the real way to
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.880]  attack this so that's why under 18 now they've phased it out but they're trying
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:42.000]  to bring it back for children now. Now I don't want to make this about the TSA
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.480]  people themselves even though a lot of them been caught stealing a lot of them
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.720]  caught being pedophiles an extraordinary amount and it's because that's the type
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:52.760]  of job that pedophiles and pervs are going to gravitate to and you know you
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.400]  see the ones that want to grow up hot women you see the ones that want to
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:00.520]  grow up men you see the ones that want to grow up kids I mean I have seen it
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.000]  with private security at concerts where they go out of their way whether or not
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.920]  checking anybody but all the super gorgeous women you know there weren't
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:11.760]  halter tops and type blue jeans you know these men and women are all over them
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.280]  you'll see you know women like to Janet Reno look alike just licking their
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.680]  lips I was in Vegas flying off from Jesse Ventura shoot and this guy said I
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:27.880]  listened to you on the radio yesterday and he was just in love with me during
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.680]  the Pat down I mean it was just unbelievable and that's my experience
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.960]  with that now I've actually had I guess what you could call the beginnings of
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:42.520]  a little smoochy moochie I mean this is what it's all about to dominate and
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:49.040]  control people then we'll get more into the open calls to ban Trump from going
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.600]  to the UK our media saying could he be disqualified he's just not presidential
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.800]  why look at England's gonna ban him he he's just terrible and that ties into all
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:04.360]  these big pushes to go after free speech because here's USA Today TV the old king
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:10.800]  of US politics faces mortality that means it's death they're dead already how
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.520]  long have I said that mainstream media is dead about three three years but they
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.160]  really passed that point where they were beyond life support they were just
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:25.560]  keeping a corpse alive and now the feet are rotting they're gonna have to cut
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:31.480]  them off they got gangrene the hearts spazzing out having heart attacks every
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:36.080]  few weeks you can't keep the corpse alive it's dead already the eyes are
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.080]  sunk in the fingers are rotting off you ever see somebody they keep alive too
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.960]  long that that's what happens and and so you know they're gonna start chopping
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:50.000]  the arms off now and there's bed sores everywhere I mean I hate to be gross
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:59.040]  about it but I mean that's that CNN MSNBC CNBC NBC news ABC news and they
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.800]  always plan to discredit the mainstream media while they destroyed the press
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.280]  because they are still scared of investigative journalists at newspapers
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.040]  and a few good reporters like the CBS reporter that exposed fast and furious
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.680]  you know just parading like there's a free press you could have somebody
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.400]  actually think there was a free press and try it inside the old media system
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.960]  so they're dismantling it but they were unable to shut us and others down before
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:26.240]  they did that so that's why they're announcing the FTC not just the FCC they
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.320]  want to send after drudge everybody they're just announcing online publisher
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.160]  rules where they're gonna look at everybody's advertising now where it's
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.160]  impossible to have advertising because in the ad you have to quote disclose
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:49.280]  where the money comes from imagine you have an ad for tennis use and and the
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.840]  whole ads about this was brought to you by blah blah blah he said oh well that'll
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:57.320]  be okay no it's to come in and selectively enforce like I was told with
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.360]  the fed snooping around for multiple sources is the FTC that they want but
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.480]  because they couldn't get the FBI to make up anything in a two-year
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.360]  investigation they just said there is nothing I mean they just dug through
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.280]  everything reportedly and that's because I've told the best accountants
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:18.080]  everybody just make sure that my rear end is as clean as the driven snow and my
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.440]  nose is clean doesn't matter and so obviously the government knows too when
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.280]  they come after us if they do we're going to put up a big political legal
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.680]  economic battle and so they just said well we'll shift this over to the FTC and
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.120]  the Supreme Court just as told drudge they're coming I've got the news here
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.240]  after we get into the TSA at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna get into this they
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.440]  are coming for our freedoms our speech everything it's here and all over the
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:51.440]  world it's happening as well expelled French journalist warns of dark days for
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:57.520]  the media in China why would Reuters report on that why would AFP were I
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.280]  mean that's happening here Obama's persecuted more members of the press
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.440]  than any other president combined that's admitted Obama's gone after more
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.080]  whistle-blowers it's crazy show after John Corbett leaves us we're gonna play
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:17.080]  jacari Jackson's report on the TSA and what's unfolding I like to have real
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:23.320]  live heroes on the show and John Corbett he's one of those people he's a
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.520]  technology entrepreneur and civil rights advocate he's worked on issues such as
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:32.200]  TSA abuse and why PD stop and frisk and it's done for 2012 video demonstrating
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.000]  the TSA nude body scanners can be beaten he is currently litigating the last
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.880]  remaining lawsuit against those scanners as well as invasive TSA pat downs
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:45.040]  professional dash trouble maker commies followed a new lawsuit I'm told and he
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.480]  also in his lawsuit has gotten the intel famously where they admit they're not
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.800]  stopping terror never stop one terrorist it's all a fraud it's basically a job
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.960]  for people to be able to rummage through and steal your prescriptions or steal
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.600]  your presence you bought for your wife or daughter I mean I've been robbed of
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.800]  the TSA repeatedly or whoever searched in the luggage I mean and of course I
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:09.040]  told you JFK now famous I'm they basically rob almost everybody there I've
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.840]  had TSA people just treat me with total contempt I've had to be really nice a
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:17.000]  lot of them are listeners so it's a but it's not their fault overall it's
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.320]  Congress and our fault letting it happen famously three years ago the Texas
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.840]  Legislature tried to pass a law saying it'd be they would charge them for
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.480]  groping genitals the response was F-16s were put on standby Obama said we will
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:34.240]  embargo blockade aircraft I mean that's how the Civil War started with ships so
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.200]  this is big this is a federal takeover they're announcing they want TSA on the
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.360]  streets domestic ID cards the IRS is saying we're not in good graces with
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:46.480]  them you can't travel this is totalitarianism and Jonathan Corbett is
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.400]  fighting it Jonathan thank you for coming on with us today let's get into
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.320]  your latest lawsuits where it's going and the TSA coming out and saying oh
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:00.480]  we're not gonna let you opt out from going into the child pornography booth
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:05.120]  hey Alex oh yeah it's good to be back I'm good my friend good good so yeah we
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:09.840]  had an update about two weeks ago where the TSA now decided that no more
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:14.640]  opt-outs unless they say it's okay so if you're on a on a special list it's not
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.800]  okay if you get randomly selected it's not okay if they don't like the look
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.200]  it's not on your face it's not okay if you're a cute female it's probably not
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.960]  okay either so you know we now have this the state of uncertainty at the
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:33.560]  checkpoint where maybe they'll let you opt out maybe they won't you heard my
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:38.120]  whole rant about the Panopticon technocracy they're building I mean in
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:42.400]  their own words they admit that's what they're building Pentagon designed and
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:50.560]  where would you say the demarcation line is in this fight against the 1984
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:57.160]  system being put in place you know it's hard to know how much the TSA actually
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.360]  does towards that because it seems like they're pretty incompetent from the
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:04.360]  surface so you start to wonder whether or not they have all this information or
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.480]  maybe they're just consumers of this kind of information so we have these
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.680]  watch twists that are maintained by the FBI the the no-fly list for example the
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:18.200]  terror screening database and so forth and it seems that TSA is a consumer of
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.240]  this data I don't know how much they actually send back I don't know if they
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:30.280]  have the skills continue with your current lawsuit so essentially this TSA for
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.600]  the last since the body skinners came out it's been arguing in court against
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.200]  in lawsuits against the body skinners that one of the reasons why these
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.200]  gunners are constitutional is because because they're optional because you
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.360]  can always opt for a pat down you know pat down is not exactly a pleasant
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.680]  option either but they've argued that the existence of this unpleasant option
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:54.000]  makes it constitutional so now that all those students have died down the courts
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.360]  has said well it sounds okay well just let it go the TSA has now moved to the
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.440]  next step which is making them mandatory so I filed suit against the TSA last week
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.640]  asking the court to and join them because they've now changed the
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.240]  constitutional balance and they've also failed to engage in normal rule-making
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.520]  procedures any other agency would have put out a notice in the federal
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.320]  register would have solicited comments from the public and they're required to
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.760]  do so by law yet they failed to do so the last time that they put the body
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.320]  skinners out and now this time that they're changing the procedure well let
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.720]  me lay some knowledge on folks that are wondering why this is happening some
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.120]  say it's inept some say it isn't it's meant to be rolled out like of the
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.160]  post office and I watched a two-hour meeting back in 2002 when they were
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:44.160]  getting cabinet level status at DHS when DHS was being created and they
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.760]  admitted the plan that you'd have to have a TSA authorization from the federal
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.240]  government you know the TSA is not just the TSA agents obviously the airport
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.720]  that's where the rubber meets the road but above that they're gonna make you
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.560]  get authorization to have a job first it's at high-value targets then it's
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:05.360]  infrastructure targets then it moves on to all jobs you have to get
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:09.080]  certification to be able to have that job then you have to have certification
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:14.920]  to be able to travel then it's a whole database on you where you start opting
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:21.520]  in to being part of the national global ID card system to get fast-tracked in so
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.920]  it's simply training if you go back to ancient humans how they would
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:32.080]  domesticate dogs or then they would domesticate horses and other animals
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.080]  obviously you try to get them when they're young and indoctrinate them but
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:39.040]  more importantly you just get them used to feeding them or putting your hands
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.480]  on them and you put them into shoots to do that at first where they're in a
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:46.600]  shoot in a pen I mean you touch them in the pen you feed them in the pen and
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.880]  and that's how pedophiles also train kids with the touching and getting them
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:54.160]  prepared so so not to head top psychologist on I mean this is the
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.200]  breaking of the American people this is institutionalizing them and just
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.960]  preparing them to go through checkpoints go through lines have their
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:06.800]  will broken be put in a scanner put their hands up you know in an act of
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:11.000]  saying you know that my hands are up I'm a criminal having the gun drills
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.080]  making people march out they admit the plan is with these extra judicial as
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:20.560]  you just mentioned systems that it's just these agencies make rules these
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.360]  agencies do what they want no one knows how you got on the list now it's a no
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:29.040]  gun by list now there's a secret list we come take your guns see where this is
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.400]  going that's why what you're doing is so important we're not just going hey man
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.320]  let them grope you a terrorist might come through the borders are open they're
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.600]  bringing people in they bring in planes from Mexico and let a hundred and fifty
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:44.400]  people in don't even look at them this is dog training this is slave training
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.640]  now I'll rant if you're so polite and keep pausing but you're the man in
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.880]  there charging and taking action lay some more knowledge on us about what's
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.040]  going on you're the guy that helped prove with their own documents that they
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:59.080]  haven't stopped a single jihadi I appreciate that and you're right in
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.400]  in two important regards number one is that this is just getting worse every
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:07.080]  time the TSA has been given something they then move on to the next more
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:11.120]  invasive because they think that that makes us more secure or that makes them
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:16.720]  have more control or whatever the case may be so that's definitely something to
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.680]  consider is that we have to draw a line somewhere and we didn't draw the line
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:26.400]  apparently at letting them use x-rays to take images of our nude body so we have
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:30.680]  to pick a spot you're also right about the fact that they don't catch terrorists
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:35.560]  these new machines these these body scanners are much better at finding
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:40.920]  drugs at finding cash at finding anything but things that will actually take
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:44.080]  down an airplane and I think that's that's for a good reason I think they
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:49.200]  enjoy their internal checkpoints I've seen them confiscate silver I mean
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:53.440]  they're just it's horrible yeah and they actually have rules that say if you are
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:58.320]  found with a certain amount of cash they're gonna notify customs how crazy
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.320]  is that it's internal violations of the fourth moment of course now they've
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.720]  also started grabbing people's laptops and phones and downloading their info
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:11.840]  yeah well customs and border patrol definitely complete says that they have
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.800]  that right and we've also seen it a little bit in airports where they've
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.760]  started to ask passengers to turn on electronic devices ostensibly to make
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.320]  sure that they're actually an electronic device and not a bomb so we all know what
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:28.560]  the next step on that one is well it's all about making us feel like we're
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.840]  suspects and people getting in our space it's how you kill a free country what
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:37.800]  about my point that a lot of civil libertarians are somewhat liberal so they
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:41.480]  don't want to point out the real argument against all this you can't have
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.800]  open borders you can't be bringing in all these people these refugees with fake
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:50.080]  passports and all the rest of it and then saying you know the main gates are
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.000]  open but we're gonna grope you internally inside the country it's
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.360]  ridiculous you're absolutely right you know what whatever your listeners
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:01.680]  standpoints are on whether we should let in Syrian refugees your point there is
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:05.320]  completely valid that if we're going to open up all these arenas for people to
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:08.800]  get into the country and to cause us trouble why are we touching grandma at
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.960]  the airport there's there's no point exactly I mean it'd be like if I said
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.480]  don't let the dog out so I open all the front and back doors but then close the
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:20.840]  closet right I mean it's like I'm gonna secure the house I'm locking the closet
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:24.760]  but everything else is open right it doesn't work and we don't screen the
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:29.440]  people that work at the airport's properly we allow people to randomly get
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.560]  through we it's just a disaster there's there's no way that the TSA could
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:36.120]  actually stop a terrorist but thankfully there actually hasn't been a
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:40.360]  terrorist that's attempted to get through the airport since 9-11 since so
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:47.960]  almost 16 years now what about the point that Steve Haussetler made it says if
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.840]  you bring too much liquid the TSA confiscates and throws it away in case
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.120]  it's a bomb so they throw it away in case it's a bomb in the garbage can right
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:24:01.360]  next to them with all the other possible bombs in the area with most amount of
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:06.240]  people in case it's a bomb yeah they know that they're not actually taking any
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:11.560]  bombs away from you part of that is revenue to the airports make a lot of
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.280]  money the airlines make a lot of money based on you buying drinks and snacks and
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:21.760]  so forth in the airport and on the airplane I did forget they didn't take
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.760]  the squash or the peppers but I was up at Omaha and had this farmers market the
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.880]  most luscious produce I've ever seen and I bought my mom some locally grown
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:35.280]  Concord grapes actually bought some of the grapes too but I ate those and they
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.320]  just flipped out and said we could arrest you what are you doing and I said
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:42.240]  oh I just forgot it's great jelly and they just like for 30 minutes hyper
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.480]  ventilated and I just I just finally went you people are nuts I mean you're
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.720]  just crazy this is all made up I said you bring the terrorists into the country
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.760]  and then they're like settle down sir settle down I'm like no I'm not gonna
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.920]  settle down I mean literally after 20 minutes I finally just got angry and I
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:00.280]  said I'm not playing along with your fantasy land anymore sorry go ahead yeah
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.720]  no you're absolutely right what are the other interesting things is this this
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.600]  policy based on the state of matter that something is in you can actually
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.040]  bring ice through the checkpoint as long as there's no liquid in it but once it
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:17.360]  turns to water it's now bomb and then there's always gonna be something new
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.400]  the terrace you know the terrorists are gonna put bombs in you know up their
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.640]  rear ends and their rectums and then show you and breast bombs what we do you
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:30.200]  know cut women's breast off x-ray them well we're ready towards the x-raying so
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:34.840]  I think we're pretty much there and of course no one seems to know about this
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.960]  but I've seen in local news in like the middle of the country and in middle of
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.240]  New York they have like army x-ray trucks that make you drive through with
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.540]  high-powered x-rays and I've had radiologists on they go that is at
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:52.520]  least a hundred times the power of a chest x-ray that's right in New York
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.760]  City they had they have them and I actually filed the first lawsuit against
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.680]  that as well in 2013 I believe it was the court just missed that one saying
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.040]  there's no proof that they actually use them that so I'm waiting if you see a
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.040]  news article that shows that they're actually in use in New York let me know
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:11.440]  and we'll reopen that case yeah they got different types I mean you just again
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.600]  you're such a hero see did suit that too folks I mean nobody else is doing it
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:19.200]  thank God for this guy Jonathan Corbett professional dash trouble maker
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.680]  dot com I mean think about that they've got these mobile ones they put you in
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.840]  throw the switch and fry you then they got them where you drive through them
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.960]  and of course the military and the police do they have any idea how deadly
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.600]  these are a lot of the TSA people tell us that these millimeter wave things
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.920]  aren't dangerous they're a lot less powerful than the other systems but
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:40.320]  still in the aggregate there are a lot of studies out there and all these
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:46.160]  cancer clusters yeah in the end it's gonna be the TSA employees that get at
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.600]  the worst and no matter how much you fly or we spend in a few minutes a day at
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:54.960]  most near them versus the TSA screener spending maybe 40 hours a week so it's
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.120]  really on them well mr. Corbett as we hurdle into 2016 I want to give you the
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:02.080]  floor for the next three four minutes other points that need to be added points
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.480]  I haven't brought up what else can you impart to our viewers and listeners out
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.040]  there sure I also have one more lawsuit that's pending against the TSA right now
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:15.720]  essentially if you were to fly a domestic airline a US flagged airline from
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:20.880]  a foreign country to the United States the TSA now requires you to go through
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.960]  an interview so if you're in say London Heathrow and you're flying American
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.000]  Airlines to New York there's gonna be some security contract through there
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.120]  asking you questions about where you're going what you're doing there and so
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.240]  forth like they think that they're allowed at their customs and border
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:40.640]  patrol or something like that so I filed suit against this because I was told
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.440]  that if I said no to answering their questions that they deny me boarding and
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.240]  there's been some success with that so far that the TSA is now backpedaled
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.720]  saying that you won't be denied boarding if if you refuse to answer the
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.480]  questions but they're they're being a little bit sketchy about saying what
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.880]  actually happens that lawsuit is also continuing well here's the big takeaway
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.360]  correct me if I'm wrong because you're probably the leading experts on this the
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:10.320]  big takeaway is if you don't push back it's only gonna get worse the power grab
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:15.520]  the mission creep it's never going to end and it doesn't keep us safe absolutely
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:18.440]  this the second the second they think that they're in control of something that
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:22.080]  the challenges are done that the public isn't looking you know they they release
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.160]  this body scanner change on a Friday night just like every every garbage
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:31.880]  government document that comes out there they will push forward until and so
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:37.560]  you're walking through naked and bending over and of course they've talked
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.760]  about actually well we've had cases where they was trip search people and
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:44.360]  grump women's genitals and they're crying and then they admitted and sometimes
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:47.880]  these guys flip out they've settled these lawsuits where they just go baby you
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:51.960]  look good can I date you I mean even and then it's on video they're like baby
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:58.240]  let's go out I mean they just horrible and if one one piece of advice I have
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.400]  for travelers if the TSA ever asked you to go to a back room with them don't
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:05.960]  don't go it's not worth the flight to have them in a room with you one on one
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:09.720]  with no cameras and no one watching to make sure they're doing it okay just
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.320]  just leave the airport don't do it well I definitely had a TML PSA God just I
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.920]  mean he was looking like a woman looks at you when they get on their name and it
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:22.640]  was unbelievable and I was just like whoa I cannot and I was just like whoa and
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:27.680]  and we follow it's you know it's some of them seem to enjoy it some of them seem
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.440]  to hate it some of them seem angry and want to make you uncomfortable you know
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.560]  it's just like any other group of people at the TSA has 60,000 random people
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.680]  that they haven't really screened and let's talk about that let's do five
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.600]  more minutes on the other side with Jonathan Corbett the last show of the
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.600]  year and then I'm gonna get into Jakari's report more on Trump more on the

[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:48.560]  sickening joke Jonathan Corbett finishing up here what other little

[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.760]  while and they reformed some but now they're coming back again well that's
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:13.320]  the whole point about a fight folks and people should know it's exciting and
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:17.080]  good to stand up and to speak out and to go leaflet the airport or to go do
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:21.720]  reports on it or to educate the TSA people and then separately I want to
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:25.400]  briefly talk about do you agree with my view that we can get mad the TSA people
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.720]  all day and obviously they're doing things that are wrong so they are
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.760]  culpable unconstitutional but isn't it a cop out just to blame them shouldn't the
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.000]  real pressure be on Congress the president the courts for allowing this
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.520]  travesty we've got NSA illegal spying and we've got illegal checkpoints and
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:48.360]  groping go ahead absolutely you know these these people are doing an
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.000]  unconstitutional job they're doing something wrong but at the end of the
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.720]  day they're doing it because the representatives that we elected are
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:59.720]  letting them are telling them to do it or or just complacent and allowing these
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.400]  agencies to run away you know you mentioned before that it's really the
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.520]  agencies that are running all running the show they're promulgating these rules
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:11.600]  and regulations and they don't really have a lot of oversight and that that
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.760]  kind of goes back to how in Congress nothing ever gets done because there's
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:19.160]  too much fighting between both sides there to actually accomplish anything so
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.080]  in the meantime while these sides are fighting the agencies aren't the
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.400]  agencies are making rules there they're changing things around and there's no
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:33.200]  Congress to actually watch them well you again are a humble man and I know Bob
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:37.920]  Barger's been fighting this as well and others but who else would you say is
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:40.800]  championing the fight what are some of the other developments what are some of
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.520]  the other factoids that you can report to our audience
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.840]  sure as far as civil liberties groups the electronic privacy information
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.720]  center epic has been at the forefront of this fight they're the first one to get
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:57.400]  a court to say that the TSA actually has to go through notice and comment rulemaking
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:01.160]  that that process of asking for comments from the public before making changes
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:05.280]  which is pretty cool there's another individual kind of like me who has his
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:10.200]  own lawsuit filed a motion for restraining order against this new thing his name is
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:17.680]  Cy you can find him at s.ai that's his website there's a travel rights group
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:23.840]  called freedom to travel USA they help to to fund certain things and to provide
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:29.880]  legal support for a lot of people that are fighting these battles there's a
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.120]  bunch of stuff going on I would personally like to see another national
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.720]  opt-out day we had one of those about three or four years ago when the body
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:43.240]  skinners came out we encouraged everyone on one day to ask opt-out and I think
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:46.120]  I'd like to put together one of those for you soon so I'm gonna see who can
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.040]  join for that one I agree and then we picked it up drudge picked it up and
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:54.600]  hammered it almost daily and I get drudge really deserves the lion's share of
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.400]  the credit and then of course the population more importantly for taking
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.960]  action and so what they do they turned them off for three weeks completely so
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:07.200]  no one could have a chance to exercise their power like Rosa Parks and so they
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:10.880]  showing that there was no terror threat and it was totally fake they announced
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:14.880]  it and turned them off for three weeks and nationwide we need to bring those
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.600]  stories back and remind people about that yeah that's absolutely right so it's
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.360]  like you were saying basically in all the airports they just stopped using the
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:26.040]  body skinners and then there could be no opt-out and you know they defeated the
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:31.440]  protests I guess if the protest goal was to clog the system but if the protest
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.760]  goal was to show that these body skinners aren't necessary then by far
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.920]  they lost the body skinners were turned off or like you said at least several
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.480]  days if not weeks at some airports and not a single terrorist got through
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:49.480]  because the body skinners aren't about finding terrorists yeah we tracked it the
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:54.040]  least amount was about a week and somewhere a month or more I just kind of
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:57.760]  just condense it down about three weeks on average and slowly would open one up
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:02.920]  and then open them all back up and it's just absolute total bull Jonathan
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.760]  Corbett thank you so much for joining us thank you for all the work you're doing
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.200]  we also need to investigate all the people that left on land security to go
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.960]  to these companies that make money off the scanners it is just incredibly
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:18.200]  shirt off is the tip of the iceberg thank you so much mr. Corbett and thank
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:22.040]  you Alex you know it's it's not every media agency that we can count on to
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.840]  actually put forward these stories but I do know that when new developments come
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:29.880]  out you guys always cover it and I appreciate that hey brother I fly I got
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:33.280]  children I mean I know how ridiculous it is to have open borders and then have you
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.720]  know some weird guy groping your genitals I mean it's just like a Monty
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.440]  Python episode of it wasn't so serious thank you sir thank you we'll see you
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.560]  next year we do have a guest coming up in the next hour
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:50.640]  Pastor David Manning one of my favorite preachers I'll just be honest he's so
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.080]  interesting funny smart a lot of times late at night if I can't sleep which
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:01.720]  isn't that often I will go over and watch him and I smile when I say it
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:07.760]  because I just I just like him and he's like a big old teddy bear or something
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:15.120]  I think he's funny too so I told I told Nico I said listen I keep forgetting to
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:20.280]  get him on like six months a year ago but just get Manning on every month he's
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:24.400]  just one of those guests like Roger Stone I mean you could not get enough of
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:28.080]  that guy and I just think about all these amazing guests I'm like a man six
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:31.480]  months with by year why would they be on the show and it's my fault I'm the one
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:34.920]  that calls the shots around here so we're gonna have more and more of him on
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:45.080]  the show because he is true Americana he exposes the long-legged Mac Daddy
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:51.080]  that's my president like Manning I don't be a lot better than Obama and he just
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:57.560]  loves Trump so we're gonna get him on coming up here I want to get to jacari
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:01.160]  Jackson's report here in a second how about somebody else I love jacari went
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:04.520]  up to the airport to cover the whole naked body scanner situation and then
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:09.360]  I'm gonna reconvene after that and get to all this news I am so focused though
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.560]  on covering all the globalism you notice I've done an hour and 41 minutes and
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:17.240]  haven't plugged anything and even most shows plug every segment and they got to
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:22.120]  the economies in trouble advertising's in trouble I get it we need to do it more
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:27.360]  often as well and not skip as many breaks or any quite frankly if you don't
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.160]  go get a prison planet dot TV membership to see that I only news and see all my
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:34.920]  films and stuff I don't want to shame you here but but you're really not helping
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:40.560]  the fight 595 a month if you want to go month a month get a year and get six
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.680]  months free we've never offered that it runs through I guess New Year's is
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:49.800]  already here so now is the time to become a prison planet dot TV member we're
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:54.560]  gonna end this in the next week or so a year membership would be 71 dollars it's
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:42:00.120]  36 dollars and 50 cents right now half off six months free normally you get a
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:03.200]  couple months free when you sign up for a year it's 54 bucks right now it's 36
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:07.920]  dollars or two months a month you know 595 you want to give us more support but
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:11.360]  you're giving yourself support all the globalists take your tax money than use
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.680]  it against you but little bits of money little bits of seed money to fund this
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:20.800]  operation you see what we've done and I'm not bragging but I like to play that
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:27.720]  old theme song what was that show about the stuntman I might fall from a tall
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.640]  tall building might wreck my brand new car but it is a
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:41.840]  destifying life I lead I take my chances what was that show the fall guy there
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:46.120]  you go the fall guy and and I mean I'm not bragging or anything here but I mean
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:52.440]  people just need to know this is no joke and I don't talk enough about stuff here
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.000]  on air that we've gone through or happened because it's kind of creepy and
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.160]  it kind of encourages it so I don't like to talk about it not talk about it
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:02.280]  sounds so wild people don't believe it which I totally get so then I have to
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:07.440]  talk more about it and then it just turns into a whole another deal but let's
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:12.800]  just say this we have a lot of eyes upon us it's just like Trump's no nonsense
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:18.120]  straight shooting that's what we do and we have a lot of good people listening
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:22.200]  and good people taking action but at the same time we're under attack if you're
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:26.760]  not a prison planet TV member the more money we have the stronger we can be
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:32.360]  and I'm just going to leave it at that the more money we have the stronger we
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:35.680]  can be the more reporters I mean right now a lot of folks are on vacation they
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:39.360]  deserve it we are skeleton crew it's hard to operate I need four or five more
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.120]  reporters four or five more writers I need some more video editors and camera
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:51.320]  people I need you know other things for this operation and to sustain our
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:55.080]  operation it takes a lot of money and to be able to stand up against the attacks
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:58.880]  that we don't even talk about which we expect I mean this is a military
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:02.560]  operation I'll just be quite honest with you that's why it's called info wars
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:05.920]  people say this guy's got to be with the government or secret groups the tactics
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:09.880]  he uses is just right out of stuff they used against the Soviet Union that's
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:13.560]  because they're tactics that work people I never went and studied those tactics I
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:25.160]  organically use those tactics with the truth and now we are studied by the
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:28.800]  Pentagon by groups which come out in the Wall Street Journal their places we are
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.640]  studied they just take what we do and try to twist it it doesn't work people
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:37.960]  have a smell for what's real a taste for what's real and we are real that's why
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:42.520]  every attack you see is about how we aren't real I'm not on the BBC morning
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:46.720]  show and tore them up tore up Bilderberg group member that was there when I got
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:50.720]  off the stage I turned my phone on to shoot a behind the scenes in front of
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.080]  the Bilderberg guy and they came back three months later and said Alex Jones
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:59.800]  just admitted it's all fake none of it's real he just admitted it's all fake and
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:05.120]  his guest goes yes I saw it thank God I literally had video of it was able to
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.720]  put it out an hour later uploaded to YouTube that's what they do folks they
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:15.000]  always say Alex told me he's a fraud Alex told me he works for the KGB or he
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.360]  works for the Muslims or he works for the CIA I wouldn't want to work for the CIA
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:29.760]  that's like working for Sears Robach they go oh really Jones got caught with CIA
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:32.400]  connections I'm gonna skip this last break of the year I gotta skip this break
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:36.560]  coming up tomorrow not time I'll put the car report because I was honest and
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.400]  talked about when I used to all they're all pretty much dead now used to go to
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.480]  family reunions in East Texas it would look like a CIA Veterans Convention or
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.160]  something where do you think agencies like that recruited from people that
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:51.360]  were willing to do whatever it took and weren't afraid so of course they went
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:57.120]  crazy in Texas and all I ever said is before those people died they pretty
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:01.160]  much all told me you're out on track it's exactly as you say in fact it's
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:07.360]  worse than you say it's unbelievable they go look he got caught he admits the
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:14.160]  connections it's like saying he knew somebody that worked for Coca-Cola you
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:19.600]  have any idea how big the CIA is it's not prestigious it's not cool it's not
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:30.320]  fun it's disgusting it's out of control it's been infested by a bunch of bad
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:35.520]  people that want to destroy this country and let me tell you you start talking to
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:40.120]  people that were in the CIA every one of them we've had 50 or more former CIA
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:44.640]  people on from Robert Baird and David Steele to just you name it they'll all
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.640]  tell you the government's corrupt it's out of control that's everything sigh
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:52.360]  hush all these people but what do you think
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:05.040]  what's powerful is individuals taking action what's powerful is people
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:12.120]  understanding that just a guy from Texas in 21 years with no help at first
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.560]  with ideas was able to give the globalist a big run for their money
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:20.600]  because our talking points our narratives which are as close to realities
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:24.480]  you're gonna get nobody's perfect are being picked up everywhere that's what
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:28.800]  they freak out about in Congress the Pentagon everywhere they can't stand
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.840]  that they admit our narratives are picked up in Congress legislation is
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:40.520]  passed off information broken on this show by our guest by our researchers by
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.000]  our reporters I'm only a focal point I'm a guy at the outside of the
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.680]  restaurant saying hey we got tables open come on in I'm just a guy getting
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.360]  people's attention I'm a flare in the night big loud aggressive but then
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:58.360]  behind it rolls in the info and that's great I get attacked I get shot down I
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.480]  get demonized I get lied about I'm a big boy people always attack me lie about
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:07.800]  me physically attack me sue me anything and they go he just seems to get happy
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:13.000]  they go man why doesn't this get to him cuz I'm not an idiot I came to fight you
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.480]  figured that out yet I came to die of need be I came to be chopped up I came
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:23.800]  to be put in prison I came to do whatever it takes that's why a lot of
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:26.360]  folks got a feeling I'll live to be a ripe old age and won't get touched
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:30.320]  because when you go into this with the right view the good lords with you when
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:36.960]  you don't you get cut down when you're a coward but it's not confidence it's
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.040]  dedication ladies and gentlemen it's not arrogance it's commitment it's not
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:46.160]  bragging it's just facts you need to know the good news you need to have good
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:50.280]  morale you need to know this is the animating contest for Liberty you need
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:54.200]  to know there are good people in private business in private corporate systems
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:58.600]  in government in the military and I'll tell you something right now that when
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:06.120]  I was younger and wasn't sophisticated I didn't understand the government isn't
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  the problem we are the problem letting it get to this we're a reflection of it
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:14.920]  we let it get usurped we let it get conquered we were cowardly we were
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:21.200]  fearful we were lazy and the government is a problem but not as big a problem as
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:25.840]  the people is what I'm getting at and there are more awake people in federal
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:31.440]  state and local government than there are anywhere else because they're there
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:35.800]  witnessing it and they're there taking the orders from corporations and taking
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:40.040]  the orders from foreign interest and they see what's happening and the
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.120]  globalists that have occupied our government want to get us in a fight
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:46.880]  with the government they want to get us in a fight as if that's where it's all

[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:40.400]  somebody it's smarter than than the star good the bad the ugly Clint Eastwood I
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:45.160]  mean they all look like that in the eye and let me tell you they were that they
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:50.120]  were lovers they were fighters they were killers and they didn't take crap off
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:54.160]  anybody and it wasn't because they were big tough heroes it was because they
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:52:00.120]  were default mean they were default tough they were default not cowards what's
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:12.640]  that quote from true grit what's that quote he says I think he says he's mean
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:20.280]  and he's double tough go to YouTube type in true grit double tough I forget the
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:28.760]  exact quote people didn't didn't act like they were tough they were tough they
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:32.840]  didn't act like if you shot your mouth off of somebody's wife they'd say you
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:35.720]  get your gun you come outside right now you're gonna pay for that they weren't
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.240]  doing that because they were peacocks they were doing that because they
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:45.040]  weren't gonna be run over Bill Waters is the best tracker the meanest one is
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:50.000]  Rooster Cockburn a pitiless man double tough fear don't enter his thinking I'd
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.800]  have to say LT Quentin is the straightest he brings the prisoners in alive
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:59.800]  where would I find this rooster I gotta say I better than the John Wayne when I
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:03.800]  love the one with the dude all right I gotta get to the Chicago Jackson report
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.400]  let's go ahead and go to this report on the TSA from the Austin International
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:11.840]  Airport Berkstrom the former SAC command base with a giant underground train
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:15.320]  station that goes all the way out to the hills at Fort Hood where they store the
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:19.560]  nuclear weapons and there's a nuclear reactor under UT and two reactors up in
[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:22.680]  north Austin and when I talk about it the paper says it's a conspiracy even
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:25.880]  though you could Google it all right now and find it's there the briar green
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:32.440]  hotel ain't got nothing on ABI here it is the use of TSA body scanners has been
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:36.600]  a very controversial topic with privacy advocates stating that the machine
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:40.800]  show too much of one's person health advocates and pregnant mothers concern
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:45.760]  about the effects the machines can have on unborn children citing how X-ray
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:50.360]  technicians use lead walls before they operate similar types of machinery with
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:55.760]  all this in mind the TSA has quietly phased out or is phasing out the opt-out
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:59.560]  option stating how they can strongly suggest that some might go through the
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:03.320]  machine as opposed to getting a pat down so we're going to ask the people out
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:07.600]  here what they think about the new change in policy oh excuse me sir we're
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:11.040]  asking people what they think about the TSA change in policy eliminating the
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:16.600]  pat down option I have not heard about that oh well I didn't have to go through
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:22.000]  security this morning but you did um I don't really I think it's fine yeah I
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.720]  think as long as they still do a thorough check then I judge the world
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:30.960]  I am I'm not actually go through some of the pre-line so I don't have that deal
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:37.200]  so I do pre also because I come here too much well some people concerned you
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:40.000]  see pregnant mothers and health advocates they're concerned about the
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.480]  effects the machines can have on things such as unborn children well okay so
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:49.800]  you're talking about eliminating the ability to do a pat down in lieu of the
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.760]  scanner oh no I think they need to keep it for that well some people concerned
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:56.360]  that's her off the others and health advocates they're worried about the
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:00.920]  effects that the body scans could have on unborn children that's true I didn't
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:06.440]  think about that I mean from what I've heard and what I've seen online and
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:13.040]  so forth is the radiation is really minimal so I personally I think if
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:17.880]  that's if that's something that you're worried about probably should figure out
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.240]  a different way to get to where you're going oh now they're doing that I don't
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:28.160]  I don't like being patted at all oh one normal pet somebody else okay
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:35.200]  on that one very traumatic for me what do you think about your wife going
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:39.360]  through she's pregnant well I'm sure there's probably needs to be more
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.640]  research to find out if it actually happens or not it's interesting to note
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.920]  that the shining example for why body scanners are used in the first place is
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.280]  the underwear bomber a person who was allowed through the security checkpoint
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:57.280]  many years ago meanwhile a man was able to transport a pistol through security
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:03.080]  just this year also even though the TSA has yet to stop a single terrorist
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:07.200]  attack we saw the state of Texas threatened with a no-fly zone when they
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.840]  sought to oust the agency and finally activist John Corbett who was previously
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:16.880]  censored by the TSA for posting documents that they themselves released
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:22.800]  is suing the agency over the pat down rule change and there you have it more
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:26.720]  reports at info wars.com
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:28.920]  Jacarie Jackson
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:32.120]  that's Jacarie Jackson sound like a superhero name I love it
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:37.640]  who has a cooler name here at the office Jacarie Jackson or Marcos Morales
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:41.960]  Marcos Morales sounds like a race car driver's name Jacarie Jackson sounds
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:47.200]  like I don't know like a screen lantern character or something
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:51.800]  Axon Jackson actually Jackson goes around beating people up right I'll
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.760]  remember those those movies okay let's get serious here because this is serious
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:00.960]  subjects and I've got a guest coming up it's gonna be extremely informative it
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:04.920]  is the last broadcast of the year by the way who's who's hosting the fourth hour
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:10.800]  today oh it says that here yes Anthony Gutiarty we have Pastor David Manning
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:16.760]  joining us as well coming up really the big theme is they're attacking free
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:20.520]  speech everywhere they're now saying banned Trump from the campaign the
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:23.440]  media is doing every trick they can anyone's talking about banning him from
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:29.160]  going to the UK US spy agencies crushed congressional demand for more
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:34.160]  employees scrutiny oh because they're the boss the bureaucracy it's like the
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:37.080]  Federal Reserve said oh the Congress has no control over the Federal Reserve we
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:44.000]  control the money read the Constitution the Congress has the sole power to issue
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:51.360]  and control currency and money but PBS says that's not the case just like two
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.920]  plus two equals five this is the type of garbage they're engaged in but it's not
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:58.800]  working anymore because I mentioned the big USA Today article why do they want
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:02.960]  to censor info wars.com why do they want to censor grudge why do they want to do
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:10.800]  all this because we are kicking the living snot out of these people TV the
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:17.600]  old king of US politics faces mortality that's a nice way of saying TV the old
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.920]  king of lying and manipulating the mindless masses faces its death and
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:29.160]  wouldn't mainstream media announce the death of itself a few years too late
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:33.800]  that's good though they don't know they're already dead they've still got a
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:40.800]  little bit of snot-nosed conflicts and that's only gonna help us defeat them

[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:13.800]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Coming up

[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:41.640]  that is some of what is coming up and Obama is going to bring in ultra
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:45.320]  massive 30 plus million worker visas they're having them print them up right
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:49.920]  now just outside of law this just absolute insane asylum level garbage
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:54.440]  that's all coming up but when Congress says hey stop spying on us and scrutinize
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:59.280]  your employees the NSA and others just say shut up we run you scum and
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:03.440]  Congress and rolls over on their belly like a little puppy and you know PPs on
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:08.160]  themselves in fear here's John Bounds report on that. When it comes to
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:14.240]  telephone calls every member of Congress has been briefed on this program
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:19.400]  with respect to all these programs the relevant we brief intelligence committees
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:24.520]  are fully briefed on these programs these are programs that have been
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:33.240]  authorized by broad bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006 and at the
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:39.240]  outset it's important to understand that your duly elected representatives have
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:45.720]  been consistently informed on exactly what we're doing. The apparatus of the
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:50.880]  Obama administration's NSA tentacles apparently have zero boundaries after
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:55.200]  spying on journalists foreign dignitaries and the average Joe it has
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:02:00.080]  finally now come to light that Obama and company have been spying on Congress
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:04.520]  itself. I'm appalled by when we listen in on foreigners conversation when
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:07.880]  they're talking to Americans we're scooping up tens of thousands of
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:11.360]  conversations of Americans this is a real problem because it's a real
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:16.400]  invasion of our privacy. At this point it wouldn't surprise anyone if funeral
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.320]  arrangements for the Fourth Amendment were announced within the next few days.
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:27.640]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:36.760]  of Americans? No sir. It does not. Not winningly. As the communications of
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:41.360]  allies such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were monitored so
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:45.680]  were their interactions with US members of Congress as well as American
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:50.560]  private interest groups with links to the foreign leaders one unnamed US
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:54.200]  official revealed to the Wall Street Journal that the practice raised fears
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:03:01.640]  oh the executive branch would be accused of spying on Congress. The Obama
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:06.440]  administration were wary of this and so simply allowed the NSA to decide what
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:12.280]  to share without making any specific requests. We didn't say do it. A senior
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:17.080]  US official said we didn't say don't do it. You can see how it would stifle
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:21.400]  speech if you're going to eavesdrop on congressmen and that it might stifle
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:25.760]  what they say or who they communicate with. We absolutely need more controls on
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:29.680]  the NSA and more controls on our intelligence agencies. Forget controls
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:33.760]  Senator Paul. We need heads to roll. And where is the president during this
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:38.120]  unprecedented breach of the Constitution? If you hadn't noticed President Obama is
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:43.120]  down in Hawaii on an extended two-plus week vacation that is costing taxpayers
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:48.320]  no less than four hundred and seventy thousand dollars per day. Once Obama
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:53.880]  finally leaves office, if he does, he will have spent nearly seventy million
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:59.920]  dollars of taxpayer money on just seven Hawaiian vacations alone. The last time I
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.280]  checked the president's annual salary was four hundred thousand dollars per year
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:08.400]  with a fifty thousand dollar annual expense account and nineteen thousand
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.960]  dollars for entertainment. When did anybody agree to fund seventy million
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:16.960]  dollars of taxpayer money so that our thief and chief could live like a
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:21.520]  billionaire and focus on the new Star Wars film while putting his toes in the
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:26.800]  sand and simultaneously destroying our founding principles? Early this morning a
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:30.320]  House panel hastily announced that it opened an investigation into the
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:34.720]  overreaching intelligence collection of Congress. Can you hear that sound? That's
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.440]  the sound of Tricky Dick rolling in his grave. I have never profited, never
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:45.120]  profited from public service. I earned every cent. I welcome this kind of
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:48.760]  examination because people have got to know whether or not their president is
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:54.000]  a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got. John Bound
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:00.960]  for Enforce.com. Well, he was an angel, okay, compared to Obama. Bill Cosby has
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:05.600]  been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:09.760]  Crimes punishable by five to ten years in prison and a twenty five thousand
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:14.360]  dollar fine. But what about the other Bill? Former US President Bill Clinton
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:18.320]  whose past predatory behavior is once again in the spotlight after Hillary
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:23.720]  tried unsuccessfully to play the sexism card against Trump. For years, Bill Cosby
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:27.720]  continued raking in millions while the media covered up his dirt in order to
[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:31.520]  preserve his legacy. But even after exposing years of predatory sexual
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:35.720]  behavior, Bill Clinton remains a highly revered member of the Democratic Party,
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:39.640]  pulling in tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees while Hillary was
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:43.880]  Secretary of State. For someone running a campaign on female empowerment,
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:48.000]  Hillary can't seem to shake accusations that she defamed, threatened, and
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.800]  attempted to personally destroy Bill's bimbos in order to silence them and
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:57.440]  protect their abuser and her rise to power. Leigh-Anne McAdder reporting for

[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:16.560]  Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:36.040]  By the way, there's a giant skyscraper on fire in Dubai. They believe it might have been
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:39.360]  started by fireworks. They're not sure and the whole building just has red flames,
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:45.560]  white flames shooting up through it. We have the video up on InfoWars.com. You
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:48.760]  guys might be able to just to punch up CNN. It was just on in there for TV
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:56.240]  viewers and it's not collapsing but Tower One, Tower Two and Building Seven all
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:00.080]  collapsed magically and then they announced an hour before that it fell
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:05.600]  symmetrically, Building Seven, before it even fell. So they got their official
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:10.120]  story out a little bit too early that day. Kind of like it was announced an hour
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:15.480]  before he was even arrested in Australian papers that Lee Harvey Oswald was the
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:20.640]  teller of Kennedy. Sometimes people don't get their time zones right. You know,
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:25.560]  private company people screw up too and the CIA does sometimes too, don't they?
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:29.760]  But there's the building. I mean, will it collapse in on itself? I mean, obviously
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:37.320]  small parts of it will fall but not the main super structure. The fire has just
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:42.280]  been burning for a long time. Now it's engulfed much of the building. Again, a lot
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:45.520]  of people are radio listeners. That's the main bulk of this audience but a large
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:51.280]  part of it is TV. Infowars.com, Ford's live show and some UHFVH systems and of
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:54.760]  course cable and places like Houston, Texas carrying the transmission. I want
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:58.920]  to thank all those folks carrying the show, all the sponsors and wish you a
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:05.160]  hopefully good new year without World War Three with the Russians and more. So
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:17.640]  Donald Trump comes out and Donald Trump says that until they start checking
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:21.280]  refugees coming in from Muslim countries, we've got to block all these
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:25.440]  Muslims from coming in. When the media cuts it to him saying, block all the
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:30.800]  Muslims coming in. And then we have articles out of CBS News, you name it.
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:34.920]  We just showed him last hour. We're 150 people from Mexico, from all over the
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:42.360]  world, fly in at JFK where Pastor Manning is up in New York. And they just
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:46.400]  say, these people are allowed to walk in through customs, nothing's checked. And
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:49.360]  there's no investigation, nothing happens. All over the country, the Border
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:53.120]  Patrol's ordered to, quote, complete the smuggling process and load people on
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:11:01.200]  buses from all over the world. We're not making this up. We were told by ICE to go
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:04.200]  down to McAllen, Texas. We got it on video. The New York Times had to admit
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:08.440]  it months later. There's New York Daily News with a headline, 150 people from a
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:15.120]  flight from Mexico allowed to bypass customs, show no IDs. But Donald Trump
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:17.960]  needs to be banned from the UK. The government says they're now actually
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:22.960]  looking at banning him because hundreds of thousands of people signed the
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:26.280]  petition. So if hundreds of thousands sign a petition to arrest him, will you?
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:31.640]  How about arrest Alex Jones? Sounds like Nazi Germany. We know most of the
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:37.160]  refugees, almost all of them are Sunni that invaded Syria and are now being
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:39.760]  kicked out by the Russians. And so they're supposed to come here, shoot
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:43.560]  people and blow stuff up a small minority of them, and then our rights will be
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:50.400]  taken. And they call Donald Trump a racist. I'll tell you something right
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:56.280]  now. Obama comes out and says he is disqualified from running as if he waves
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:59.720]  a magic wand. Well, I guess he does. He says executive orders next week to
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:03.680]  restrict the Second Amendment. Politico's reporting. California and other
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:07.360]  states have passed laws to just take your guns with no proof, no threats, no
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:13.720]  nothing as a quote, wellness check. Just like the old Soviet Union. It's here,
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:18.720]  folks. Lawless, out of control, corporate interest running our country into the
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:23.080]  ground. And they sit there with a straight face and say you didn't build
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:28.440]  your business and Obama cares free or you can keep your doctor. All meant to
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:31.960]  run this country into the ground and break our spirit, break our will. And I
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:36.560]  know Hillary's evil. I know Obama's evil. I know Bernie Sanders is out of
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:43.920]  control rat. And then there's Donald Trump. And I wasn't completely sold on
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:46.520]  him six months ago, even through three months ago, but I've seen what he's
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:49.480]  done now. I've seen how they're coming out against him. I've seen how both
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:52.120]  parties are giving money against him. I've seen how they lie about it, how
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:56.640]  they won't show his crowds. Every dirty trick they've got to misrepresent what
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:01.520]  he says or what he stands for. And it's blowing up in their faces because they
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:05.720]  have such little credibility. We've reached that moment where they have such
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:09.560]  little credibility regardless of who Donald Trump is, good, bad, or a little
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:13.840]  bit of mix of both like most of us. He doesn't want to destroy this country
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:17.680]  that much as clear. He didn't want to mount America's head on the wall like
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:21.480]  he's conquering it, like the Democratic Party's doing. It's mentally ill. It's
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:28.480]  satanic. And Pastor Manning was right. I remember having him on before Obama got
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:31.120]  in office and he said, look out. He wants to destroy the country. He wants to
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:34.160]  bankrupt everything. He's a radical Muslim. All this is gonna happen. I said,
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:36.360]  listen, I love hearing you're preaching and you're a great guy and you're
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:40.480]  really smart, but I just think you're going too far. And he said he's gonna
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:44.480]  create all this racial division and he's gonna bring in all these problems and
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:49.640]  that's their plan to stabilize. And I said, Manning, you're wrong. That was eight
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:58.160]  years ago, the year before Obama got in office. And now I just cannot believe the
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:01.680]  documents came out. He's funding the overthrow of Egypt and CNN endorsed it,
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:05.080]  but the Muslim Brotherhood and groups to murder every Christian, blow up churches,
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:09.920]  crucify people on the streets. I mean, my God. And then Anderson Cooper, I'm not
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:12.920]  using the Lord's name in vain. I'm saying, my God, help us. I just can't help but
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:17.200]  cry out to God when I realize we have leaders that actually want to kill us. So
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:23.640]  joining us is the head of OTLAB. And of course, he is a person for decades
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:30.040]  teaching and free lunches and meals for the kids there in Harlem, going up
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:35.160]  against, he was here almost six months ago and he said, we're gonna bring down
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.040]  Al Sharpton. Now see Sharpton being removed and being brought to the
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:42.640]  weekends and all the rest of it. And he prayed for it. He said it and it's
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:46.720]  actually happening because he is the mafia don that runs Harlem. In my view, I
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:51.200]  call him a mafia don, a political mafia don. James David Manning is a chief
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:54.680]  pastor at Otlow World Missionary Church in New York City. Manning has been in
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:15:00.040]  Otlow since 81 and he stands for the, all the land anointed holy, which is God
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:03.720]  named for Harlem. And I'm not going to get into all his degrees and background
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:07.200]  on the rest of it. What he's done, he's been very successful at waking folks up
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:11.200]  and we salute him in his work and he has been proven right on so many fronts.
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:14.200]  Pastor Manning, I thought you were being alarmist eight years ago, but I tell
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:18.400]  you, we are in a fight for our lives right now and we are up against the
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:23.320]  satanic force. You're absolutely right. No, we are at war, Alex. There's no doubt
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:28.880]  about that. And I've started a campaign to get Trump elected. Need to get him
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:33.120]  past the Republican nomination process, which is going to be very difficult
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:37.920]  because you've got both Democrats and Republicans working together to stop him
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:44.000]  with every power that they can muster. But we have called for Harlem for Trump
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.200]  and I gotta tell you, Alex, black people here in Harlem are touting that Trump
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.680]  is the man. They're finally hearing what they thought they were going to hear in
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:57.640]  Obama. They're hearing a man who's speaking truth to power. I wasn't for
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:01.680]  Trump and Alex, I don't generally endorse candidates. I usually run them down
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:04.800]  to run down their pedigrees and talk about them and try to give people some
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:10.640]  idea how to make a choice. But Donald is the man. There's no doubt about it. He is
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:17.560]  the man for America. Obama has, in fact, Donald, Alex is perhaps the only man I
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:23.320]  know right now that can put America back together again because Obama has
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:27.200]  destroyed it. And anybody else who gets into power will sit down in that
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:32.400]  Oval Office, is going to continue the policies of Obama and continue the
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:37.800]  destruction of this, this, this nation. Listen, you mentioned Anderson Cooper a
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:40.640]  few moments ago in Egypt, and we can come back to that and we can talk about
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:44.280]  that as a major subject at some point in time. But I gotta tell you, Anderson
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:48.600]  Cooper ought to be put on trial. But he and Obama working to destroy the
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:53.000]  relationship that Egypt had with Israel and destroy the relationship that
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.320]  Egypt had with America and to set off what it was now known as the Arab
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:01.360]  Spring or the Egyptian Spring. They now join the Russians. They, they drove our
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:06.360]  oldest ally after Israel away from us. They're destroying the country. Yeah. And
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.760]  so I, I, you know, they are, Donald is the only man that will look at this
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:16.640]  truthfully and say what we as Americans cannot be great again until we examine
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:19.840]  this and somebody needs to go to trial. Somebody needs to get a gavel of a judge
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:23.640]  say life sentence or something on that order, especially Anderson Cooper. That
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:27.640]  is why this is happening. Nobody ever gets punished now for their crimes. Yeah.
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:31.200]  And you know, you can see that in the banking industry, Wall Street, these
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:35.600]  banking thieves, these banksters never get arrested for all of what they do in
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:39.600]  criminality in terms of banking. But now we see it in the media and politics as
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:44.560]  well. You predicted what Obama would do. What do you expect to be doing this
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:49.160]  last year in office? I mean, the word is the hammers coming down next week. Well,
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:52.760]  yeah, I, you know, and I suspect that it will. I think that word is an accurate
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:57.360]  word and you use the word lawlessness and with respect to Obama. And I thought
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:01.760]  to myself, as you were speaking that the lawlessness is not without purpose. If
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:07.120]  Obama can somehow or another bring about a reason for martial law, then
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:09.320]  that's what we're going to have to drink. That's what we're going to have to
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:12.600]  eat. That's what we're going to have to look at in order that Obama might
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:17.240]  maintain his power. You know, how he's going to do it. I'm not sure. But I can
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:23.040]  tell you that he's not ready to give up that power for several reasons. One is
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:27.520]  that he just thinks himself in terms of an egomaniac that he ought to always be
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:34.120]  president. I mean, I've, I saw that in him six, seven years ago. I'm not sure
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:40.000]  exactly where we are, but I know martial law is on the table. Alex, people
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.720]  that's what Soros and the State Department do everywhere else. And they're
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:46.400]  clearly trying to do it. That segues into black lives matter and the whole
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:49.520]  police thing. No one can deny there's big problems with police departments. The
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:53.120]  bill of rights is in trouble. But when they make that the center issue to
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:57.640]  destabilize them and then have the Democratic Party and the U.N. with
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:04.160]  these city initiatives, strong cities initiatives actually take them over. I
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:08.240]  mean, this is scary. Well, actually, what they're doing with items like black
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:14.320]  lives matter is trying to see which is the most explosive issue to start either
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:18.280]  a race war. You know, they're talking about taking down the statue of
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:21.520]  Robert E. Lee there in New Orleans. I'm sure you've been to New Orleans. You've
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:25.280]  seen New Orleans. You've seen that statue in front of St. James Infirmary. You've
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:28.960]  seen that statue. It's a beautiful statue. They're talking about taking down
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:32.680]  the statue of Boregaard taking out Jefferson Davis. I gotta tell you,
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:37.000]  they do that. You're going to get the sons of the Confederacy rising up to
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:42.120]  say the hell no. We've had enough. We don't have a nation left anymore. So
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:46.120]  we've got to take to arms and defend our nation. They're testing which will go
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:49.200]  black lives matter or fighting the Confederates or the sons of the
[02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:52.320]  Confederacy. I think that's right. They're trying to stir everybody up. Right.
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:59.040]  Yeah. And to get an explosive situation where Obama can then declare martial
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:04.880]  law and he will become the supreme law person in America. And what if he says
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:08.000]  goals? There'll be no constitution. Nobody will have any constitutional
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.480]  protection. You, Alex, will not be able to broadcast. I can tell you that right
[02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:15.320]  now. They will shut you down like a cheap suit. They will not let you
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:21.240]  broadcast. So, by the way, a major Supreme Court justice. Um, I'm not
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:24.360]  liberty to say which one, but we can probably make a guess. His friends with
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:28.720]  Matt Rudge told him at dinner. You know, at a private party, he said, I've been
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:32.360]  told they got the votes next year. They're coming to shut down talk radio.
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:35.640]  The Christian churches with the IRS. Look at all the persecution we've
[02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:41.600]  already seen against the press. I mean, it is incredible. Well, yeah, it is
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:47.960]  this talk radio. This press that you do is so well that maintains America,
[02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:51.840]  whether Americans realize it or not. Well, you're feeding and I'm to some
[02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:55.840]  degree feeding information to people, giving them hope and giving them the
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:58.360]  alternative. You know, the other thing about Donald Trump, if I could just
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:03.680]  mention her once again, is that anybody that goes at the entire press for
[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:07.800]  Donald, there is no liberal. There is no conf, no concern. Show something
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:12.280]  lie. Yeah, I mean, he calls them all liars. I mean, and he doesn't bite his
[02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:15.560]  tongue. Yeah, you got to know that this man understands something critical
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:18.760]  about it. Respecting us forever. He just throws it. Now, let's talk about
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:21.880]  Trump. You've got the floor. I mean, let's talk about why you don't normally
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:25.160]  support candidates, but you like Trump. Go ahead. Well, you know, I mean,
[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:28.480]  because the politicians, the politicians, Alex, you know that and you've seen
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:32.240]  the way in which our nation has gone over the past generation. So I mean,
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:36.560]  I politicians, they are who they are. They're usually bought and paid for by
[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:41.160]  big money donors like George Soros, even the Koch brothers, and they they owe
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:46.720]  their allegiance to these persons that pay their bills. And what they do is
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:51.280]  that they support politicians, support each other that matter, matter of
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:56.280]  Democrat or Republican, and they shaft the people. The reason why I'm
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:22:01.080]  supporting Donald Trump is Donald Trump supports the people and shaft the
[02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:05.560]  politicians. Listen, Alex, I was in a meeting not long ago at Trump Tower
[02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:09.720]  with 80 some preachers, all black preachers, all black pastors, various
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:13.560]  churches, you know who they are and how they behave themselves. I've been a
[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:17.280]  pastor for over 30 some years and I know the mindset of Christians and the
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:21.680]  church and how Christians act one towards the other and pastors one
[02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:28.800]  towards the other. Alex, I was with Donald for three hours. This man sat
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:34.120]  in a meeting with 83 preachers, most of which, if not all of which, except for
[02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:39.480]  me, were telling him he needed to apologize for roughing up the black
[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:43.520]  lives matter guy that tried to disturb his meeting down in Alabama, I think it
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:50.160]  was. But he sat there with the kind of patience. I don't think Dr. King could
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:54.960]  have handled those preachers and not just with patience but respect. He has
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:58.760]  scary stamina. He has scary stamina. That's one reason I admire. It's
[02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:03.160]  incredible, Alex. It's incredible what he was able to do. That scary
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:08.520]  stamina is a great phrase to identify him. But he did that and not only that,
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:13.720]  but if someone was speaking and mostly it was just garbage coming out of the
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:17.080]  mouth of these preachers, but he paid attention. I mean, he didn't offer
[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:22.520]  skin anybody. He didn't belittle anybody. He let people talk and even though the
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:26.880]  meeting ran over time, he still sat there and listened to what they had to say
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:31.080]  and addressed. Nobody felt the bum rush from Donald Trump. I said, this is my
[02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:35.840]  man. I got to support him because he was honest. He was integral and I think
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:39.960]  he'll do the same thing with America. Well, I've learned some of the inside
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:43.360]  stuff about it and he's a free market guy. He's certainly not pervy. He's very
[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:47.280]  dominant, very aggressive. The thing they try to demonize male strength. People
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:51.040]  are very hungry for that. That's why they try to kill it. Right. Absolutely. And
[02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:53.760]  I've done it in the family. They've done it everywhere as you've documented. As
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:56.040]  you know, the black community was the beta test, but it's for everybody. It's
[02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:00.800]  working really nicely. The country's falling apart. But Trump really doesn't
[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:04.320]  like seeing America killed. He really doesn't like all these foreign interests.
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:08.360]  He said that are tax exempt, but he's not and blue collar worker. And when he
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:11.360]  comes out and says these brokers firms aren't going to be tax exempt, they're
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:15.520]  going to bring their money back here. And we're not going to shut off our power
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:19.640]  plants and we're going to do better trade deals. I mean, that would turn this
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:23.960]  country back on and listen, it's hard to suppress America. That's I mean, the
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:27.400]  Federal Reserve used to say the economy is overheating at 3% growth. We're
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:31.240]  going to put a blanket on it. That's what they're doing. Shitting on us,
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:35.800]  deciding winners and losers, giving Obamacare waivers to big companies, but
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:40.480]  not the little ones. We've got a mafia style government and it needs to come
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:43.720]  down and Donald Trump is ready to blow it to hell. What do you expect they're
[02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:46.600]  going to try to do to Trump because the demonization isn't working? Pastor
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:51.880]  Manning. Well, I tweeted, I think it was yesterday or the day before that
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:58.040]  Donald Trump is in grave danger and not just from the from the Democrats. He's
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:03.400]  in grave danger for rents, previous and Carl Rove and Obama. Every power
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:08.640]  source wants to take Donald down. You know, I haven't seen in my heart a
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:13.680]  felt in my spirit, Alex, that they're going to try to, you know, assassinate
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:16.680]  him, that kind of thing. But I haven't taken that off the table as a
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:21.280]  possibility or Donald meeting with some unfortunate incident. You open up with
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:26.240]  this fire that's going on in Dubai at that hotel there. This very exclusive
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:31.000]  luxury hotel in Dubai, which is really an Arabic, if you will, but a, an
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.120]  appendage of American government, you know, they could set Trump towel on fire.
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:42.920]  Donald can meet with some unfortunate incident that would be as ridiculous as
[02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:49.080]  both world trade centers falling flat after being hit 45 minutes early and
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:54.560]  both falling without any kind of, well, it looked like they were falling with the
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:58.240]  power of a dynamite blowup rather than powerful power of planes.
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:01.480]  That's what they never said. Donald may meet some unfortunate, and I'm not
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:04.480]  taking that off the table, but I'm praying. Their favorite thing, I agree, we didn't
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:06.880]  pray for him. Let it happen. Their favorite thing to do is blow up your
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:11.640]  airplane. Yeah, they could do that. I mean, they, because he's always on that
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:16.040]  plane flying various places, but that would be so obvious. You know, I think
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:19.600]  they would, they realized that we're told he's got private security and the
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:23.160]  secret service. And I was told by, I'll just leave it this insiders that the
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:27.400]  secret service has never been more concerned. They are literally basically
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:31.520]  have their guns out all the time. Well, we met with Secret Service when I went
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:35.640]  down to talk with him or meet with him at Trump Tower, and they were all over
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:40.280]  the place. I mean, they were like, yeah, you can get through the, the, the
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:44.440]  interest gate without going through them. He has his own security service, as
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:48.960]  you very well know, but you could tell the CIA and Homeland Security, those
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:52.920]  guys were there in big numbers. But you know, listen, I heard a report
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:57.440]  yesterday that four Secret Service agents got arrested up at the border of, of
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:01.120]  Massachusetts and Connecticut, and nobody knows why. What were they doing
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:04.920]  up there? They were involved in the automobile accident, and nobody knows
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:08.400]  what they were doing there. And it still hasn't been reported. I think the
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:14.200]  story has been covered up. What were the secret service agents doing up there
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:18.800]  with no person that they were guarding? We know what happened down in, I
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:23.080]  forget the name, Argentina, not long ago with the Secret Service being
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:27.840]  involved with prostitution and child prostitution. We know that they have
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:32.920]  been lax, on the job drunk, running into the barriers at the, at the, at the
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:37.440]  White House. So, you know, I would not give the Secret Service the credibility
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:40.600]  to protect Donald that I think we would normally do on the normal
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:45.960]  circumstances. Well, expanding on that, normally, like with RFK or JFK, it's
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:49.680]  inside jobs, and it's going to be the security right there with them that
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:53.520]  actually does it. I wouldn't say it'd be the Secret Service, but I tell you, the
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:57.800]  fashions of the CIA and others, they better watch it though, because people
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:01.160]  don't buy what the, and that goes back to what I first said. I don't want your
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:05.680]  view on this, Pastor Manning. The fact that Donald filled this vacuum shows how
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:10.040]  little credibility mainstream media has, dinosaur media has, and the fact that
[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:14.360]  the more they demonize him, the more popular he gets, that's really got to
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:18.120]  scare them and let them know they're not in the same ballgame they used to be
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:25.160]  in. Yeah, and that's, and that's what, you know, I've stated, if Donald can do to
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:29.600]  the media and to the political process that we see going forth in this primary
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:35.240]  campaign, he's got everybody turned on their heels. Nobody can figure out what's
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:39.040]  happening. Nobody can predict what's going to happen next with Donald, but
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:42.360]  everybody who loves America loves what Donald is doing. If he can do this to the
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:46.440]  political process, Alex, think what he can do to the American government once
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:50.960]  he sits down in that, in that Oval Office and talking about these, these
[02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:56.760]  corporations and not paying interest or not paying taxes. I believe that Donald
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:29:01.720]  could bring jobs back from China. He could bring jobs back from India. You don't
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:04.840]  even have to be a genius. You just snap your fingers and say, we turn back on a
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:08.080]  thousand power plants. The electricity price gets cut in half. I mean, just
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:12.680]  stuff like that. Boom. We can have, we can have seven jobs for every American
[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:17.800]  with Donald as president. And I think the powers that we know this, so where's
[02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:23.200]  it going to go from here? I think is not necessarily anybody's guess, but if I have
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:26.280]  anything to do with, and I think the people I'm talking to offline have
[02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:29.320]  anything to do with, we're going to put Donald in that Oval Office. That's what's
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:31.960]  exciting. Pastor Manning, stay there. I want to come back and get the calls, but I
[02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:34.960]  want to hear from you, because I know you wouldn't say it if it wasn't the case,
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:38.200]  because you were talking about how popular Sharper was, you're still going to go up
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:41.680]  against him. You're saying Donald's getting pretty popular in Harlem, with
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:45.160]  black unemployment doubling under Obama. I want to hear about that straight ahead.
[02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:53.840]  Ottluck.org. Stay with us. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones

[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:04.920]  Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, went on the Morning Joe show to
[02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:10.080]  call for a small surtax to pay for the war against the Islamic State. Coons said
[02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:14.760]  in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for use
[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:19.400]  of military force, Congress must levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:24.440]  action against IS. The U.S. has spent more than five billion dollars on the war
[02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:29.800]  against IS since August 2014. The cost is expected to rise considerably now that
[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:33.760]  the Obama administration has said it will step up the campaign to wipe out the
[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:38.080]  group. Despite spending billions, the air campaign has failed to weaken the Islamic
[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:42.200]  State, according to intelligence officials on Monday. Representative Peter
[02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:46.440]  King, a New York Republican who serves as the chairman of the House Committee on
[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:50.640]  Homeland Security, said that after 16 months of airstrikes by the U.S., it's
[02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:58.520]  had a really minimal impact on ISIS. You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:03.840]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government
[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:08.960]  institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money. And
[02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:13.160]  it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to
[02:31:13.160 --> 02:31:18.400]  use those holiday gift cards. The numbers are staggering. In the past five years
[02:31:18.400 --> 02:31:24.040]  alone, 41 billion dollars of consumer gift cards went completely unspent. That's
[02:31:24.040 --> 02:31:29.760]  41 billion taken directly from our back pockets. Don't let them win. Instead, use

[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:09.640]  spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was
[02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:14.320]  designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children are hit with
[02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:19.280]  modern mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it. Young
[02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:23.080]  humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered
[02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:27.840]  daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:31.760]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my team, we
[02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:35.120]  set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that
[02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:38.880]  children would actually like and take. We worked with the leading manufacturer and
[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:41.840]  nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most
[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:46.440]  affordable and powerful calming formula out there. Introducing child ease with
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:50.640]  herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential

[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:49.200]  across the board on the store. We started this gift card thing. There's a lot of
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:53.440]  gift cards, people, you know, cash cards. People got confused. There's so many cards
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:57.000]  are proprietary to a certain store. You know, it's a Barnes and Nobles card. It
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:01.200]  works there. A Target card. It works there. So just 15% off across the entire
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:06.120]  store. That's gonna go for one more week. Got a bunch of discounts as well, but they
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:10.360]  really are game-changing products. When you talk about the nutraceuticals and
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:14.920]  infowarslife.com, that is the products that we've developed with top experts,
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:19.760]  three of the top companies in the nation, super organic, tri-brain force,
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:25.320]  tri-supramel vitality or female vitality. Try Survival Shield X2, the good halogen,
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:29.320]  the true nascent iodine. As best we can tell, nobody else has got true real
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:33.360]  nascent iodine. This is actually yet. Turns bright blue on paper. That's what
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:38.920]  color iodine is, not red. That's just an example. You know, we take the raw iodine.
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:44.080]  Nobody's got this. This stuff turns into gas in the open air until it's injected
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.920]  into the organic palm oil. So we're showing, I mean, it's like the purple
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:51.760]  stuff that, you know, I dream of genies. She flies out. It's purple mist. It's like
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:55.920]  the same thing. I'm gonna be honest. This just actually came out of the genies.
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:06.400]  I'm joking, folks. infowarslife.com or 888-2533139 as we just steam right in to
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:16.800]  2016 and I can't think of a better guest to end the year with than somebody like
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:23.000]  Pastor David Manning because since the early 80s, he's been there. One guy with
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:27.600]  a dream now with thousands of people coming to his church, tens of thousands
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:32.800]  of people in Harlem, he's helping with his great congregation and then standing up,
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:38.880]  getting political, fighting back, going through a lot of heat, having the CIA show
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:44.000]  up, the Secret Service, you name it, going through a lot. You know, he's an
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.720]  example. He won't save America. I won't save America. Donald Trump in the end
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:51.440]  won't do it. It'll be God that does that, but God helps those that help
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:55.480]  themselves. We all have to carry the ball together and then there will be more
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:58.160]  voices. One of my favorite quotes I haven't given them probably a year is
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:02.960]  Mark Twain, in the beginning of Patriot is a scarce man hated, feared, and scored,
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:07.360]  but in time when his cause succeeds, the timid joined him because then it cost
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:13.360]  nothing to be a patriot and we are seeing the real attempt to bankrupt this
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:16.640]  country to dominate us through economic conquest. I mean this is yet, that
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:21.280]  didn't rhetoric folks. It's happening. You said Obamacare wouldn't happen. It
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:24.680]  happened. You said they wouldn't come out of the guns. They're coming. They're
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:28.800]  coming out of the free speech. Most generations that go under tyranny don't
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:31.720]  believe it could happen to them, or they think the tyranny comes like the last
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:37.440]  generation, like Hitler or a Stalin. No. No, it comes in corporate conquest with
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:41.200]  these front people. These corporations know if they can be faceless, nameless,
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:45.520]  and bankrupt you and exempt themselves from the laws and taxes, they run your
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:50.160]  life. You're now a slave. So while we're all having our rights stolen and our
[02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:53.800]  birthright destroyed, they're up there telling us all to fight with each other
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.840]  over what color we are. That's divide and conquer. Now, Pastor Manning, I've got my
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:01.840]  questions. I don't want to go to calls, but first off, you say the community there
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:05.720]  in Harlem really waking up and really liking Donald Trump. I'd like you to
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:09.640]  elaborate on that, please. That's very exciting news because it just shows we're
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:12.760]  thinking outside of the box regardless what somebody thinks about Trump. And then
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:18.520]  I want to ask you what you think Obama's going to try to do in his last 11 months
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:25.400]  or so in office, sir. Let me explain to you why I'm convinced that Harlem will
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:30.080]  vote for Trump and communities like Harlem, Southwest Chicago, South Central
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:35.000]  Los Angeles will vote for Trump in the primary also in the election. Number one
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:40.360]  is that my enemies have become trusted. My enemies now trust me. I think it's the
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:43.920]  best way on the phrase that yeah, my enemies now trust me. Alex, I'm here in
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:47.160]  Harlem. I'm not on the outskirts of New York City. I'm not in the Bronx or
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:53.000]  Brooklyn. I'm in the middle of Harlem. I'm in the vortex of the flagship of the
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.760]  black community, African American community, if you will. I'm here and I've
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:00.960]  been here for 30 years. The people in this community have seen me stand up
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:05.600]  against the civil rights organizations. They've seen me stand up. I let a
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:10.680]  protest when Obama came to Harlem the one time he has come here. I let a
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:14.840]  protest against him very successfully again and the people in the community
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:19.040]  watched that. The people have heard me talk about Obama, talk about him the
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:23.320]  same way you heard me identify who he is, that he does not care anything about
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:27.320]  black people, that he's a rip-off artist, he's a conman, he's a pimp, they
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:31.280]  do a long-legged match. He seems to go out of his way to hurt black people, huh?
[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:35.480]  Yeah. He seems to go out of his way to hurt blacks. But the people have heard me
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:41.000]  say those things, Alex. Then they saw me go against Al Sharpton, another one of
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.040]  their favorites and one that Al Sharpton being a favorite of Obama that has
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:48.640]  been to the White House more than 83 times. The people in this community, the
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:54.920]  black people in this community quietly watched me fight Obama, fight Al Sharpton
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:59.080]  and be successful at both of them. And they've watched me do it with, if you
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:04.120]  don't mind my saying so humbly, a modicum of integrity and commitment and
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:09.000]  service to them. They now trust me. So when I tell them Donald Trump is the man,
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:13.640]  they believe it and they're going to vote for him. But not just that. People are
[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:16.920]  for Donald Trump because for the same reason you're for him. Black people,
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:20.880]  that is. They hear him speaking the truth and speaking truth to power and
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:24.760]  destroying the political process. One other thing, Alex, I got a fellow that
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:29.200]  works with me and my programming named Bob Jackson. He does a lot of promos for
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:33.400]  me. He helped me take down Al Sharpton. I want to introduce you to him because I
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:36.320]  think y'all can work together doing a whole lot of things. Sure, I'd love to get him
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:39.680]  on. Absolutely. You want to, I mean, you're introducing him right now. Yeah, I don't
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:44.520]  know. Do we have one of Bob Jackson's clips that we can play right now? He's a
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:49.240]  great promo clip maker. Let's do this. We'll talk to him soon. Getting back to
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:51.600]  him before we go to calls. I'll put you in touch with him later. Right now, you and
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:54.720]  I need to continue. That was my next question though. And that's what I love
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:57.200]  about you. You're always just like reading my mind or I'm reading your mind.
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:01.040]  And we're like synced here. I mean, you, you don't shoot your horn, but do it
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:04.240]  because it's an example of success. Others can emulate. You went after
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:07.360]  Sharpton that, I mean, folks burn up in buildings that mess with him. And this
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:11.400]  guy's serious business. You went up against him like a year ago and I thought,
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:16.880]  man, Manning really has got some, you know, you know what's, but I, but it's
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:22.120]  happening now. He's getting moved off MSNBC. He's in trouble. I mean, what? And
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:26.120]  now he's, he's going against their own other mafia done in Chicago.
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:30.600]  They're fighting with each other. No honor among thieves. Yeah, because
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:36.440]  Obama has kicked them to the curb. MSNBC has demoted him from a five night a
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:40.920]  week spot in prime time, eight o'clock on Sunday morning when they nobody
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:44.200]  watching him and nobody going to watch them. That's how they got rid of Pierce
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:47.920]  Morgan at first. When they move you from prime time to a one hour show once a
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:50.880]  week, that is firing you. That's just kind of letting out a, you know what, in
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:56.200]  church real quietly. No, Sharpton is gone. And, and, and, and I'll say we took him
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:01.840]  down Alex. We marched against him. We, we stood out in front of his studio where
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:07.040]  he goes in and, and MSNBC. We were out there several days. We stood in front
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:12.920]  of several major dealers, advertisers like BMW and restaurants that were local
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:16.720]  here that advertise on this broadcast. They came out and told us we're not
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:21.440]  advertising anymore. We took Sharpton down. No, we took him down. I'm not being
[02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:25.240]  modest about that. He's certainly fired the flare gun and, and, and said
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:28.080]  charge. I would agree. You were, you mean your horse was at the head of the
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:32.880]  charge. Alex, let me let you listen to a little taste of a promo that Bob
[02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:37.560]  Jackson put together for us. And we played this outside of MSNBC and outside
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:55.680]  of the advertiser. Listen to this. This is Bob Jackson.
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:25.600]  The way he raised MSNBC, black trick and Dickie and FBI snitch. I'll keep
[02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:35.000]  staying rich not paying taxes. Yeah, police and green New York's finest
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:47.720]  I'm gonna put them in touch with you. That is beautiful. Please send me that
[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:50.440]  song. If you want us to make a music video with it, that is powerful. Sir. Thank
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:55.040]  you. Great job. I'll have my, my producer get it right out to you. He's
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:59.240]  extraordinary. I got at least a hundred pieces by Bob Jackson. Please. We want to
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:03.320]  play him. I bet Rush Limbaugh will end up playing him. Wow. I tell you, I bet you
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:10.520]  will forget it. Forget it. Amazing. I'm sorry. So just in closing, I want to go
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:13.680]  these calls with you and closing my questions. What do you expect him to
[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:16.920]  launch next? Because obviously the empire is going to strike back. People are
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:20.360]  really away. They're trying to destroy Trump. Not that he's perfect, but he does
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:23.880]  now basically represent people that are against his globalist takeover. They've
[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:26.920]  set him up as our champion. So if they knock him down, it hurts us. But this
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:33.400]  awakening isn't going to stop just for Trump. No, it isn't. Uh, and right now
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:39.240]  Obama's in control. Um, and there's no separation of powers between Democrats
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:45.320]  and Republicans as far as that is concerned. Um, I see a terrorist event,
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:52.600]  uh, not here, but one of our allies that will force Obama. And the reason why I
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:58.680]  say not here, Alex, is because Obama is deeply in bed with the promotion of
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:03.960]  ISIS, with the promotion of terrorism, with the promotion of Islam, uh, around
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:09.160]  the planet. And they understand that process. Uh, a major event here in
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:14.200]  America would render Obama powerless against the rage of the American
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:19.640]  people. But in Paris or in Germany or in some other place, it might not be so,
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:24.600]  but would give Americans pause to be cautious and allow our liberties to be
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:28.840]  taken away from us, martial law to be put in place so we could be checked.
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:32.840]  Our guns taken away from us. Every last gun, every last gun.
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:35.160]  Well, I agree with you. That's where it's, I mean, you would think if they bring
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:38.600]  in all these radicals, they shoot up, they blow stuff up, the government gets
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:41.400]  in trouble. No, they just go, no, veterans and gun owners and Christians,
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:43.960]  you're the terror threat. We're going to take your rights because the terrorists
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:47.160]  attacked and then they don't get in trouble bringing the terrorist in.
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:50.680]  What is the calculus there? Where are they coming up with this?
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:55.240]  Well, I, I said, you know, I've asked this question time and time again about
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:59.800]  why and what's the motive behind it. It's, it's a, it's, it's the sin motive.
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:04.280]  It's the old sin motive of greed and of power.
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:07.640]  Radical Islam hates us and they hate us too. So the socialist are combined with
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:12.920]  it. It's just a match made in hell. Yeah. And we, as the American people,
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:18.280]  Donald Trump has awakened the spirituality. Donald Trump has awakened
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:22.760]  the patriotism of Americans. You know, Alex, I have said, and I'll
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:28.360]  stand on this the way I stood on Obama being the freak that he is,
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:34.360]  is that Donald Trump has the power to bring racial unity to this nation,
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:40.760]  like no other person has ever been in the past or I doubt even in the future.
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:45.960]  I believe that and I stand on that. And that's one of the reasons why
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:49.160]  they are as straight up Donald Trump as they are, because he can take the black
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:52.680]  vote and the Latino vote and still build a wall down there
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:57.400]  on the border. I believe that. Amazing. We'll see what happens regardless.
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:46:59.880]  It's a big illustration that way. Speaking of martial law, Mike and I,
[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:02.920]  I know as a point or question on that, thanks for calling Mike here on the
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:11.480]  air. Hi, Alex. After Manning, I think you're right about martial law coming
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:17.640]  to the U.S. under Obama. And one of the reasons is recently I just saw a brand
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:22.840]  new show that's coming out in 2016. It's a weekly television show called
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:26.440]  Colony. And the whole show is about a totalitarian
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:33.080]  takeover of the U.S. and martial law. And throughout the show, they asked the
[02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:39.400]  question, which side would you be on? Either a collaborator or with the
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:44.360]  resistance. And you can go vote on that. And I think what that show does.
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:49.080]  They're profiling people to poll. Absolutely. They are, they are, they are
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:52.040]  benign. Undoubtedly, they're getting everybody ready.
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:55.000]  And I'm telling you, martial laws in the cards in Europe have already declared
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:58.600]  civil emergency, banning criticism in any way of
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:02.040]  Islam or open borders. So it's all, they won't call it martial law,
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:05.480]  but they've told Drudge and others that they're coming after our free speech
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:11.640]  next year. Pastor Manning. No, you know, martial law is the only option left on
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:15.240]  the table. My only question, Alex, as I've been over
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:17.880]  the last hour explaining, is how they're going to implement it.
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:20.760]  What will be the catalyst? They're going to start a race war, aren't they?
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:23.480]  What will be the kindling point? You can see them, I put it up. I mean,
[02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:26.680]  whether, obviously there's some bad cases of racism against black people and
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:29.720]  stuff going on. But the point is, is that a reason to have a war and burn
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:32.760]  everything down so George Soros can take over? I mean, so obvious,
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:37.240]  they're trying to stir everybody up. Well, I mean, you know, this business of
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:40.760]  Black Lives Matter and other racial, they've done nothing but the acorn, if you
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:44.120]  will, revisited from what they were some time ago.
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:49.560]  But this is the only option right now. And black people being a part of a
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:53.560]  reason why you could claim that we ought to, you know, they ought to be
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:56.600]  martial law because of the killing of black people. Listen, black people kill
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:48:59.960]  each other a thousand times more than any white
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:02.520]  police officer ever dreamed. Well, I know it's white, but absolutely,
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:05.800]  you're absolutely right about 98% more dangerous. But I mean, you're right. What
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:08.200]  I'm saying is, they're going to try to get riots going. They've been trying as
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:12.840]  hard as they can. Yeah, you know, I'm not sure exactly.
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:17.160]  I think a better shot at the getting riots going will be
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:21.080]  to awaken the sons of the Confederacy,
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:25.000]  of which I would love to fight with. And I've said so. I've said so
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:29.080]  for the past six years, since my video I put out called White Rodney King.
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:32.200]  I think they have a better shot at that than they do
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:36.280]  because a lot of black men are in jail, many of them are on drugs,
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:40.360]  and they're just not battle ready, Alex. Black folk,
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:44.440]  black men are battle ready. They're not, and the ones that are not on drugs
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:48.600]  or in jail are pinching those fags, if you will. They're just not battle ready.
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:52.920]  But now the sons of the Confederacy, you're talking about a different group.
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:56.680]  You're talking about a group that's locked and loaded, and they've got a
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:50:01.240]  reason to fight for this nation. Whereas black folk might fight for a
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:05.320]  bigger food stamp card or fight for more whatever it is they're going to fight for.
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:09.080]  But you know, I don't see black folk fighting for America. I see them burning
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:11.960]  down communities, but I don't see it. But you know,
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:15.320]  some of the, some of the Confederacy, we're talking a different animal all
[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:17.400]  together. Well, I know they like to stir that up,
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:20.360]  and we know the Civil War was when we let it stage. Now people, I, people,
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:24.440]  people should be peaceful, offensively peaceful. But if they start trying to take
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:28.280]  guns or put political leaders in prison or grab Christian leaders,
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:32.200]  which the IRS persecution is the first phase of, at a certain point you get pushed
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:35.400]  into a corner. I think you're right. They're trying to push folks into a corner.
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:40.360]  Mike, I appreciate your call. Jeff, Craig, Adam, Cameron, others, your calls are
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:44.040]  straight ahead. We'll have a pastor manning five minutes to the next hour. Then Anthony

[02:53:03.080 --> 02:53:08.280]  is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Something shocking just
[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:13.080]  happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego. The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and
[02:53:13.080 --> 02:53:17.960]  are now destroying the young bucks and head-to-head fitness tests. How is this even possible? Turns
[02:53:17.960 --> 02:53:22.360]  out the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:27.240]  mountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for
[02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:31.640]  many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy
[02:53:31.640 --> 02:53:36.280]  a thing of the past. Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units,
[02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:41.000]  but for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:45.800]  free samples specifically for our conservative friends. All they ask is that you chip in a few
[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:53.000]  bucks to cover shipping. To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to green75.com.
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:54:03.000]  That's green75.com.
[02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:31.880]  Pastor James David Manning is our guest, Otla.org. You can see his amazing preaching and his daily
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:40.280]  news reports and radio show, TV show. Otla.org. And again, you could start a video podcast. You
[02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:45.400]  could start a radio show if you have the passion. And then just move forward. This is a guy who
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:49.880]  reaches millions of people every week. And that's why I just admire what he's done because
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:55.480]  so many people get into fighting tyranny to, I guess, be stars or be cool. And then they get mad
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:55:00.200]  at other hosts and mad like their competition. We don't have a future of these people win. I'm not
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:05.800]  in competition with Rush Limbaugh or Matt Drudge or David Manning or World Net Daily or anybody.
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:11.800]  Glenn Beck, I don't care. I wanted to preserve the Bill of Rights and Constitution. I don't want
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:19.000]  them sexualizing five-year-olds in public schools. A bunch of freaks. They're taking us over. They're
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:24.040]  conquering us. It's time to say no. Jeff in Florida, you're on the air with Pastor Manning.
[02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:28.520]  Yes, sir. Two of my favorite people in the world. You guys are awesome.
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:30.280]  Well, thank you, brother. You're awesome. What's on your mind?
[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:31.480]  God bless you, sir. God bless you.
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:37.400]  Pastor Manning, man, I just called your office yesterday. I got a song for you. Give this one
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:43.800]  to Bob Jackson. Hit the water with the rock. Don't you go back? No, man, no, man, no.
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:48.440]  All right, sirs. Do you have a question for him about 2016?
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:53.960]  Anyway, yes, sir. I did. I wanted to know what you guys think. What's going to happen this next
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:58.840]  year? We've had so many things that have happened to us in the last year over all the false flags
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:06.520]  from the shootings to the fires, to the drills going on right under our noses. I'm a small family
[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:11.640]  with one child. I want to do the best. I come down here from Denver, Colorado. I watched everything
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:18.200]  go down. Well, brother, I would just say this. Pray to God to lead God in direction. That's
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:22.600]  always the best thing that I do. And then just the answers come to me. Literally. I don't mean
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:28.120]  to get religious folks. There's no atheism. I'm led by the spirit. Let me chime in on that question
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:34.520]  about 2016. I would, I would suggest to everyone whose heart is true and right before Almighty
[02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:42.680]  God that we would get ready to enter into major leadership from a patriot point of view, from
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:49.480]  a biblical point of view, because it's our responsibility to fight this tyranny. And so I
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:54.920]  would say to people that God will be sending out the anointing and the power for us to take
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:57:00.200]  major leadership positions. I just discussed that a few moments ago before the show with one of our
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:04.760]  leading elders in the church, we need to get ready to lead fast. I've been really feeling that and
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:10.600]  saying that I never wanted to do that, but I really feel that's the office. I've got to do it. I'm
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:15.400]  sorry. Go ahead. No, so you're picking that up too in your gut. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:24.040]  So I think that it's going to be it's our time. In fact, we have to do it. We have a charge
[02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:29.560]  from Almighty God to do it. And there are a number of people that are dependent upon us to be able
[02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:35.800]  to do it. And we're going to have to do it. If we don't do it, we're going to all go to Guantanamo
[02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:40.280]  Bay's all over the world. And that ain't going to happen. That's not going to happen. So we got
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:44.440]  to get ready to lead. We just got to get ready. That's right. We're in the fight whether we admit
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:50.760]  it or not. We're not looking for this. Absolutely. But we got to do it. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:59.080]  So I think that mantle has fallen upon us. We've been in training for several years
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:08.120]  for the process. The people are with us and the nation needs us. I think that that piece you
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:13.400]  quoted by Mark Twain, a favorite of mine is well regarding, you know, patriots and, you know,
[02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:17.800]  as the battle rages, you know, it doesn't take a lot to be one. But we've been in training for
[02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:22.360]  some time now, Alex. You know, it is, I mean, you know, there's a God above, not just in your
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:26.360]  spirit or your gut, but you see things when you realize you look back at your whole life's training
[02:58:26.360 --> 02:58:31.000]  for where you're at. And then you see every good, bad, and ugly thing that happened literally was
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:35.960]  training to be able to take the stuff we take now that 20, 30 years ago I couldn't have took.
[02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:40.200]  I mean, absolutely. God was just building our muscles to just take this huge load.
[02:58:40.200 --> 02:58:49.800]  It's amazing. We'll be back with a few more calls with Pastor Manning. Thank you, Jeff. Great points.
[02:58:49.800 --> 02:58:54.360]  Our bloated federal government and a coterie of mega corporations are hoping that we all
[02:58:54.360 --> 02:59:00.040]  have the memory of a goldfish. We forget to use those holiday gift cards. Every year,
[02:59:00.040 --> 02:59:05.560]  millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and mega corporations
[02:59:05.560 --> 02:59:10.760]  steal billions of dollars of their money. Instead, use your gift cards to help support

[03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:31.240]  the fourth hour with all the breaking news and intel. Pastor Manning of Otla Worldwide,
[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:38.120]  Otla.org is our guest, taking a few more calls for him right now. But I have said this many times
[03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:41.720]  on air because it's true. I learned to be a radio host that made films, wrote some books,
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:48.360]  and wanted to just warn America like a Paul Revere. I did not want to get put in the position of
[03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:53.800]  being a general in the fight. Believe me, the average egomaniac would love that until they
[03:00:53.800 --> 03:00:58.440]  actually got the responsibilities, the death threats, the thinking through stuff, having to
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:02.120]  make the right decisions, getting upset with yourself when you make the wrong decisions.
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:08.600]  But now it's amazing when Pastor Manning was saying that because a lot of insiders I talk
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:13.480]  to a lot of other people say it's just hitting them right now. They have to lead. They have to
[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:18.840]  fight. They have to get involved. The sleeping giant is rising right now. And that's because
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:22.840]  evil is coming in folks. And as the Bible says, the pastor may know the verse. I just know it from
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:27.160]  memory. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard
[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:32.840]  against it. And all of you are leaders in your area against this evil. And don't even overthink it.
[03:01:32.840 --> 03:01:40.440]  Just go with God, vio condios, do the right thing. Pastor Manning. Yes, sir. No, we have to
[03:01:40.440 --> 03:01:46.120]  accept the charge. We have to accept the responsibility. If you love your family,
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:51.320]  if you love your children, if you got grandchildren, they're sexualizing our five
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:57.480]  year olds in the schools. We've got to stop that. You are not worth your salt as a man
[03:01:57.480 --> 03:02:04.680]  if you allow this perversion to continue within our schools and in our and on in the workplace.
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:09.640]  We have got to take the leadership position in a much larger way in which we're doing right now.
[03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:15.720]  The truth of the matter is, is that it's inevitable. It's biblical. And Alex, you know,
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:21.720]  you're one of the generals. I'm not trying to stroke your ego or anything of that nature.
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:24.760]  But you've been on the battle. You've been on the front line for quite some time.
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:31.960]  And and people trust your longstanding integrity. Listen, I took down our shop,
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:35.160]  but not because I want to be the leader here in Harlem. God forbid, that's not what I want.
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:41.000]  That's dangerous. Yeah. But, you know, because of the need to get the people to get people from
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:46.360]  underneath the suffering that our shop, we're gonna boycott it. And you said within six months,
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:52.760]  you'll lose this show. It's happened. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, we've just got to know in your spirit
[03:02:52.760 --> 03:02:56.120]  that was going to happen if you took action. Remember, you said, you said, if I do this,
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:02:59.480]  if I take action, other people will leave by example, he's gonna fall.
[03:03:00.360 --> 03:03:06.840]  Yeah. And so we took that action. And people are now trusting me. People who once were very
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:11.880]  suspicious of me. They didn't think I was black enough. They call me an uncle Tom or Coon or
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:15.400]  nigger. They call me all those things because I didn't get down with the so-called black
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:21.560]  civil rights movement and Obama worship. But Alex, they are now shaking my hands on the street.
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:26.040]  I mean, if they walk past me, they want to stop and talk to me and thank me for the standard I've
[03:03:26.040 --> 03:03:30.680]  taken. So we, uh, you've got to do the same thing. And others have listened to me, have to do the
[03:03:30.680 --> 03:03:36.040]  same thing and not for yourselves. But think about your children. We shouldn't allow our children
[03:03:36.040 --> 03:03:41.080]  to be led to slaughter the way people are trying to do with the sexualizing them and everything
[03:03:41.080 --> 03:03:45.720]  else they're doing, taking away our jobs or taxing us, not giving us the liberty to have
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:51.960]  college educate our children. I mean, destroying families, putting men together with men. We got,
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:57.160]  we need to protect our children. Well, there's no doubt that they're waging war on stability.
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:02.920]  And then selling it as tolerance. I'm tolerant. The point is, they are definitely against people
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:07.000]  that have traditional lifestyles. They are persecuting Christians. They've done things that
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:11.880]  make Nixon look like an angel. And then I wonder what's next. I mean, in the 30 seconds we got left,
[03:04:11.880 --> 03:04:17.400]  Pastor Manning, what's next if we don't turn the tide against them? Well, you know, I, Alex,
[03:04:17.400 --> 03:04:23.000]  I can't answer that question the way you would want me to answer it, because we are going to do it.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  The only thing that I could say would be utter destruction, but that's not going to happen.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:31.800]  America is too great. And there's just too many people in America right now that already stand
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:36.760]  for righteousness and stand for truth. So the answer to that question, it isn't going to happen,
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:41.800]  but destruction would be the answer. Utter destruction of us as a nation and destruction of
[03:04:41.800 --> 03:04:46.200]  those people who are destroying us, because when they take us down, they'll have no foundation
[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:50.360]  upon which to build their own. I agree. Well, I just hope for some Jonas out there to get us
[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:55.800]  our Nine of the Reprieve. Have a great New Year, sir. Thank you so much. God bless you, Pastor Manning.
[03:04:55.800 --> 03:04:58.920]  God bless you, Alex. I'm going to come right back when I think it's your turn.
[03:04:59.880 --> 03:05:05.880]  Bill Cosby has been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004.
[03:05:05.880 --> 03:05:11.960]  Crimes punishable by five to ten years in prison and a $25,000 fine. But what about the other
[03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:16.840]  bill? Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, whose past predatory behavior is once again in the
[03:05:16.840 --> 03:05:22.840]  spotlight after Hillary tried unsuccessfully to play the sexism card against Trump. For years,
[03:05:22.840 --> 03:05:27.880]  Bill Cosby continued raking in millions while the media covered up his dirt in order to preserve
[03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:33.160]  his legacy. But even after exposing years of predatory sexual behavior, Bill Clinton remains
[03:05:33.160 --> 03:05:38.280]  a highly revered member of the Democratic Party, pulling in tens of millions of dollars in speaking
[03:05:38.280 --> 03:05:43.800]  fees while Hillary was Secretary of State. For someone running a campaign on female empowerment,
[03:05:43.800 --> 03:05:49.080]  Hillary can't seem to shake accusations that she defamed, threatened, and attempted to personally
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:55.960]  destroy Bill's bimbos in order to silence them and protect their abuser and her rise to power.

[03:08:17.400 --> 03:08:22.600]  My friends, there is a real danger in this divided congress strategy that the social
[03:08:22.600 --> 03:08:27.880]  engineers are going to be successful as you're creating more divide in congress strategy,
[03:08:27.880 --> 03:08:34.600]  more tribalism. We really should judge people by the character of their actions, by their deeds,
[03:08:34.600 --> 03:08:39.800]  like Martin Luther King said. That's how I judge a musician, it's how I judge a chef,
[03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:48.200]  it's how I judge a builder, it's how I choose a lover, if you're married, it's how you choose
[03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:54.760]  things is by its fruits. But they steal our individualism when they make us a group.
[03:08:56.120 --> 03:09:01.080]  But then when they create so much racism, you're almost forced into your group just to defend
[03:09:01.080 --> 03:09:06.040]  yourself because you're being attacked by other groups just because you're, quote,
[03:09:06.040 --> 03:09:13.240]  in a perceived group. So there's lots of contradictions to all of this, and as the public
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:18.440]  gets more and more dumbed down, as the media system becomes more and more pointless,
[03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:25.400]  people don't know how to navigate that. And there's a lot of fights going on, a lot of
[03:09:25.400 --> 03:09:31.720]  real beefs, and a lot of real issues as well, mixed into all these falsehoods. But know this,
[03:09:32.680 --> 03:09:37.960]  if you transcend it all and look at it, the social engineers have stolen the issuance of
[03:09:37.960 --> 03:09:43.640]  currency and credit, they've created all these fake derivatives, tied us to it in debt, and are
[03:09:43.640 --> 03:09:49.800]  systematically engaging in genetic manipulation of not just the human species, but every other
[03:09:49.800 --> 03:09:57.640]  major species. And what they're doing is very reckless and dangerous. They act like a textbook,
[03:09:57.640 --> 03:10:04.520]  historical, kill razor demon. Now, whether you think that's real or not, it doesn't matter.
[03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:15.960]  As I've said thousands of times, art typally, these people love ugliness, they love death,
[03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:22.680]  they love failure, they love sabotaging elegant, beautiful systems, they love destroying free will,
[03:10:22.680 --> 03:10:33.400]  they love disabling, twisting, hurting, humiliating, dominating, stupefying.
[03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:47.240]  They are, in short, the devil. And they claim they come to empower and bring human liberty and
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:55.240]  strength and options, but they give you the knowledge of good and evil. You already have
[03:10:55.240 --> 03:11:01.080]  the knowledge of good, at least in past generations now, they're phasing out the knowledge of good
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:06.120]  and only having the knowledge of evil. First there was only the knowledge of good,
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:11.720]  then there was the knowledge of good and evil. And the knowledge of evil was the twisted con
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:17.320]  artist technologies, the manipulations of words, the manipulations of math, the manipulations,
[03:11:17.320 --> 03:11:29.240]  the creation of fraudulent systems that do not create higher orders. They can devolve or rot,
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:38.680]  they cannot fly, they are fallen. They want your soul, they want your intellect,
[03:11:38.680 --> 03:11:49.480]  they want to destroy your future, they are absolute death, spiritual anathema, separation from the
[03:11:49.480 --> 03:11:58.760]  light, claiming to be the light. But you judge a tree by the fruit it produces and these people
[03:11:58.760 --> 03:12:04.440]  produce hell on earth. I will attempt to do a Facebook mentions in a YouTube today, a year in
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:10.920]  review, but I think we'll probably just come back in future shows and kind of do the review,
[03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:15.880]  year in review and then look forward. But it's a very, very interesting time to be alive to say
[03:12:15.880 --> 03:12:20.760]  the least. I'm going to hand the baton to Anthony Gutiarty here now so he can host the rest of
[03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:28.360]  the fourth hour today, but now is the time to really retrospectively look back on your life
[03:12:28.360 --> 03:12:33.400]  and look around you and ask, do you just want to kind of go along, watch TV, watch sports,
[03:12:33.400 --> 03:12:36.840]  never really have goals, never really have a destiny, you think you're getting away with
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:42.120]  just kind of not doing anything? That's why you're so empty. I'm talking to folks that aren't away,
[03:12:42.120 --> 03:12:53.800]  I'm not patronizing our audience. It's animating, it's invigorating, it's empowering, it's dynamic
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:13:03.800]  to get involved in history. It's dynamic to be real. And so I'm asking you,
[03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:11.080]  why not make the full choice to commit to human freedom and human free will?
[03:13:12.120 --> 03:13:19.400]  Why not fully commit to fight the evil and start understanding you don't need to go to that
[03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:24.840]  establishment church to find God, you don't need to go to that establishment guru to find God,
[03:13:24.840 --> 03:13:30.520]  you need to simply understand that as Christ said, you would ask God in, knock on the door,
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:33.640]  the universe that God made right through you, God's coming in.
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:42.360]  And if you can get past the fear, all the fears that are going to be whispered in your ears,
[03:13:42.360 --> 03:13:46.120]  of what's going to happen to you if you throw those devils out,
[03:13:46.120 --> 03:13:53.640]  if you decide not to work off of twisted logic, the knowledge of evil, but use the knowledge of good,
[03:13:55.320 --> 03:14:03.800]  then you will become an oasis in your area to others who have fallen a long way towards
[03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:11.160]  the web that has been spun for them at the bottom. That's why people that have been turned over to
[03:14:11.160 --> 03:14:16.760]  evil hate good and hate creation and hate beauty and hate purity because they know they've fallen,
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:22.520]  they know they've been conned, they know they've been destroyed already. Those people are the enemy,
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:28.840]  but there's not actually that many of those. Most people are confused and powerless and don't know
[03:14:28.840 --> 03:14:36.680]  what to do and they think if they engage in dark tricks, twisted logic that somehow it will get
[03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:43.320]  them ahead. And that all starts because they lie to themselves. It's time to stop lying to
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:47.080]  yourselves out there. It's time for me to stop lying to myself. It's all a process.
[03:14:48.120 --> 03:14:54.600]  It's time to ask God to help take us to the next level. The choice is up to you.
[03:14:54.600 --> 03:14:58.120]  Anthony Gutiarty, I'm going to go in here to this meeting and work on some of the TV
[03:14:58.120 --> 03:15:01.320]  launch we got coming up next year, but you go ahead and take over, buddy.
[03:15:01.320 --> 03:15:06.200]  You know, I love what you're saying because the truth is people buy into the number one
[03:15:06.200 --> 03:15:12.280]  biggest lie ever told, the largest deception on all of humanity. And that is that you have
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:17.640]  to buy the establishment lie, that you are worthless, you are powerless, but even worse,
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:22.040]  that you have to buy into their garbage. And once you sink your teeth into it,
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:28.040]  you think that's the only thing you consume on a spiritual level and you get into this reality.
[03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:31.720]  And I saw Star Wars last night and I want to talk about it. And I also want to talk about
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:36.520]  how George Lucas says that he sold Star Wars to white slavers and the whole big deal with that.
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:15:42.360]  But here's why I like Star Wars so much because the concept of the dark side and the light side
[03:15:42.920 --> 03:15:48.280]  really is a form of reality. And what you're talking about is also my number one topic that
[03:15:48.280 --> 03:15:54.760]  I love to talk about. People getting deceived into this false reality that they, for some reason,
[03:15:54.760 --> 03:16:00.760]  can't join the side of human empowerment. That it gives them power, this is what they believe,
[03:16:00.760 --> 03:16:06.200]  to go against it, to fight with their neighbors, to act like they're superior, to act like they're
[03:16:06.200 --> 03:16:12.120]  perfect, to act like they've got it all figured out when in reality that is a lie they're telling
[03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:17.880]  themselves. And true humans that want to empower each other and empower the species and empower the
[03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:24.040]  planet and fight the madness like the criminal charges to tech companies if they notify users
[03:16:24.040 --> 03:16:29.880]  of government spying and many of these other points I'm going to get to. If you want to join
[03:16:29.880 --> 03:16:33.880]  and fight against that, that's how you get the real power, but there are downsides. You will be
[03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:41.480]  attacked, you will be mocked, but there are solutions and there are answers and that is joining
[03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:48.760]  the so-called light side. But until the evil truly gets power, Anthony, the first phases
[03:16:49.800 --> 03:16:55.000]  of them attacking you are actually empowerment. It's a total con. People are conned into being
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:59.800]  enslaved when that's the great danger, thinking they're safe by curling up next to it. It's just
[03:16:59.800 --> 03:17:03.400]  totally ridiculous. I'm going to go ahead and punch you out, but you're absolutely right. They think
[03:17:03.400 --> 03:17:10.200]  they get power by joining with the system and at this phase of the takeover, you really don't get
[03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:15.240]  power joining with the system. Exactly. It's like a synthetic vitamin or something. Let's say you
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:20.120]  have scurvy and you're taking real natural vitamin C or eating an orange, you're curing it, right?
[03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:24.040]  But let's say we have some super, super bad synthetic vitamin C and you're taking it and
[03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:28.040]  taking it, just wishing it would cure your scurvy, your deficiency, please, I need more.
[03:17:28.040 --> 03:17:34.760]  But that is the establishment version. That is, it's a fake synthetic lie that you are being force
[03:17:34.760 --> 03:17:39.000]  fed and when you choose to consume it, you just keep doing it, thinking it's going to cure you.
[03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:45.160]  Thinking joining with evil is going to cure you. But here's the key point too, right? Because I'm
[03:17:45.160 --> 03:17:50.680]  not sitting up here and Alex isn't sitting up here on some high horse judging. How dare these people
[03:17:50.680 --> 03:17:57.320]  there? No, no, no. The key is accepting you're an imperfect human being that understands both the
[03:17:57.320 --> 03:18:02.600]  dark side and the light side, but chooses the light side that understands you are imperfect.
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:08.520]  You make mistakes. You've done bad things in your life, but you're choosing though to align
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:15.240]  your heart with the right place. And that is the difference. Instead of the establishment people
[03:18:15.240 --> 03:18:19.480]  and the people that have bought into the establishment lie and the so-called dark side
[03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:24.120]  sitting up there acting like they're perfect, they're going to tell you what to do. And they think
[03:18:24.120 --> 03:18:28.040]  their system is finally going to work when they've extinguished good and then they can play global
[03:18:28.040 --> 03:18:33.080]  galactic dictator. Exactly. And on an individual level, I mean, if someone buys into this reality
[03:18:33.080 --> 03:18:39.000]  that they get power by being deceitful and by being evil, if you want to call it that, they are also
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:42.440]  in the same in the sense of establishment, but on an individual level. So it's not just the
[03:18:42.440 --> 03:18:46.840]  geopolitical spectrum. Sure. You run into these evil people. They've got power over dumb down on
[03:18:46.840 --> 03:18:50.520]  awake people, but to somebody awake, they're like moving in slow motion. They're a joke.
[03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:55.640]  And they think you're weak just because you don't think like they do and they can stab you in the
[03:18:55.640 --> 03:19:00.040]  back. They think that's some magic trick they've got because they're such crap. Well, we see it
[03:19:00.040 --> 03:19:06.120]  in animal kingdom, right? Imagine kind of like apes or monkeys or bears. You can go in and dress
[03:19:06.120 --> 03:19:11.400]  like a big bear in a bear community, right? In a group of bears, a huge bear suit and get up
[03:19:11.400 --> 03:19:15.000]  and be like, oh, but you're actually, you know, made of cloth and a human being that could kill
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:19.080]  you in one swipe. But if the bears don't realize that you're not the alpha male, you're not the
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:23.800]  leader, right? They think they think you are because it's all a facade. That's kind of like
[03:19:23.800 --> 03:19:28.600]  these bad so-called bad people with power, right? The people that wanted to deceive you. They are
[03:19:28.600 --> 03:19:34.200]  like a fake alpha leader that acts cool and acts tough when in reality they have nothing to back
[03:19:34.200 --> 03:19:39.080]  it up. And in one fell swipe, they can be taken out intellectually. We'll be right back. We're
[03:19:39.080 --> 03:19:43.240]  going to 2016. There's so much stories to tell me stories to cover. We talk about four ways to
[03:19:43.240 --> 03:19:48.680]  change the world in 2016, four ways to make 2016 your best year and what we can do about it. I'm
[03:19:48.680 --> 03:19:52.840]  Anthony Goodsharty. This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, the last broadcast of 2015.
[03:19:52.840 --> 03:19:53.480]  We'll be right back.

[03:24:11.480 --> 03:24:16.600]  Say Anthony Gucciardi, this is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show, and I've got a lot of news
[03:24:16.600 --> 03:24:23.480]  here, but I glanced over at the computer screen here in Alex's radio studio, and it says 90%
[03:24:23.480 --> 03:24:30.760]  of Americans said 2015 was not better than 2014. That is a really disturbing number.
[03:24:31.560 --> 03:24:35.560]  And one of the things I want to talk about today, in addition to all of this news,
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:42.280]  is four ways to not only change the world in 2016, including the abolishment of political
[03:24:42.280 --> 03:24:47.640]  correctness and how we can work towards that, but four ways to make 2016 your best year.
[03:24:48.600 --> 03:24:55.240]  And I really mean that. This isn't just some cheesy BS. This is really a practical plan
[03:24:55.960 --> 03:25:04.760]  to make 2016 your best year, and get away from all the media attack on your mind that is making
[03:25:04.760 --> 03:25:09.480]  you depressed, upset, apathetic, and feel like we are losing the battle. When in reality, every
[03:25:09.480 --> 03:25:15.400]  single day is a victory. So I want to get into that here in a minute. Earlier, I had an amazing
[03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:19.720]  discussion with Alex on air if you caught this last segment, and what it really boils down to,
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:25.240]  to me. I'm going to equate this to Star Wars in kind of a funny way, because I saw it last
[03:25:25.240 --> 03:25:32.600]  night, Star Wars, The Force Awakens. Star Wars, the idea of the force to me is genius,
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:38.520]  and it's also just an adaptation of real life in some ways, in an exaggerated way.
[03:25:38.520 --> 03:25:44.600]  Every single day at a micro level, like a microtransaction, we're putting currency
[03:25:44.600 --> 03:25:50.600]  into either lightness or darkness. And the reality is we put currency into both. Everyone
[03:25:51.320 --> 03:25:57.400]  chooses light and dark sometimes. But the idea of the force is really powerful when you apply it
[03:25:57.400 --> 03:26:02.360]  to your life. This is kind of silly, but you'll get, get where I'm going with this. When you choose
[03:26:02.360 --> 03:26:06.760]  light side, when you choose the light side, you also understand the dark side, right? When you
[03:26:06.760 --> 03:26:12.680]  choose to do something good, it's not an easy choice. When you choose to harness that so-called
[03:26:12.680 --> 03:26:18.040]  force, which is really just your energy, however you want to take that as up to you, your energy,
[03:26:18.040 --> 03:26:23.400]  putting stock into either so-called good or so-called evil. What it really is, is putting
[03:26:23.400 --> 03:26:30.840]  stock into human empowerment and reality, human empowerment and reality, or the attack on human
[03:26:30.840 --> 03:26:37.160]  empowerment and reality. And when we listen to the media narrative that tells us that we're worthless,
[03:26:37.160 --> 03:26:42.280]  and tells us that we have to buy into the establishment system, that's putting currency
[03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:47.640]  into the dark side. And I mean that in, in fullness. You're choosing every single day,
[03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:53.640]  but even at the micro, micro level, being nice to someone, right? Just enjoying a conversation
[03:26:53.640 --> 03:26:59.960]  with a stranger, not being a jerk, being a decent human being. It costs zero, zero dollars to be
[03:26:59.960 --> 03:27:06.280]  a decent human being. That's putting stock into the light side, right? So the idea of the force
[03:27:06.280 --> 03:27:09.880]  is every single day you're choosing which side to go on. Every single day is a struggle,
[03:27:09.880 --> 03:27:15.320]  it's a battle, because you will be tempted to do, and I'm not talking about standard, you know,
[03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:21.080]  you'll be tempted to, you know, sin or something. I'm talking about the fight for humanity. I'm
[03:27:21.080 --> 03:27:25.240]  talking about actually getting up and doing something. I'm talking about knowing you're an
[03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:30.760]  imperfect human beings with flaws, with a past, but not letting that affect you, because guess
[03:27:30.760 --> 03:27:35.880]  what? The future doesn't look to the past. It doesn't get caught up in it. It's time to join
[03:27:35.880 --> 03:27:40.520]  up and do something. Even if it's painting that makes you passionate, if you want to help people
[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:45.800]  through that mechanism, then do it. Now is the time, 2016, even though I'm all about making changes
[03:27:45.800 --> 03:27:53.080]  daily, every day, right? I'm trying to advance myself every single day. 2016 is a new fresh start.
[03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:59.080]  It is a new mental template. Wipe 2015 clean if that's what you need to do, and start now. This
[03:27:59.080 --> 03:28:04.600]  is the last broadcast of 2015. I'm honored to be selected to help host this fourth hour.
[03:28:05.560 --> 03:28:11.400]  And if you take anything from this broadcast with me today, know that tomorrow, even though it's a
[03:28:11.400 --> 03:28:15.560]  silly human creation, you know, it's just a new year on the calendar, I get it. It's nothing
[03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:19.880]  actually new, and sometimes it's silly to have these resolutions that we don't keep. I get that.
[03:28:19.880 --> 03:28:24.760]  Fresh start, though, it is a new year, and now is the time to actually join the fight and do something.
[03:28:24.760 --> 03:28:30.600]  Now is your time. This is your call to arms. So I want to get into some things. Let's hit some
[03:28:30.600 --> 03:28:36.440]  news before we get into the four ways we can change the world in 2016, which means four solutions
[03:28:36.440 --> 03:28:42.280]  that actually work that I'm going to get down. So tech companies face criminal charges if they
[03:28:42.280 --> 03:28:46.120]  notify users of UK government spying. And you've probably already heard about this story, and
[03:28:46.120 --> 03:28:50.840]  I'm going to follow up with it. Last week, it was reported that Yahoo had become the latest company
[03:28:50.840 --> 03:28:56.840]  that promised to alert users who were being spied on by state-sponsored actors. So the UK
[03:28:56.840 --> 03:29:01.640]  government, well, we'll just criminally charge you if you tell people that we're spying on them
[03:29:01.640 --> 03:29:08.920]  and hacking into their emails. How dare you do that? Well, Microsoft, I'm going somewhere with
[03:29:08.920 --> 03:29:14.920]  this, Microsoft will warn email users of suspected hacking by governments they claim. This is from
[03:29:14.920 --> 03:29:20.360]  the foreign desk says Microsoft Corporation said on Wednesday it will begin warning users of its
[03:29:20.360 --> 03:29:26.280]  consumer services, including outlook.com. Where is this all going? It's kind of like the Associated
[03:29:26.280 --> 03:29:32.360]  Press. The government is getting so intrusive, so bureaucratic and so bloated that even Silicon
[03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:37.480]  Valley now is fighting back because this isn't an isolated incident. Multiple tech companies are
[03:29:37.480 --> 03:29:42.120]  saying we're not going to stand for this. We're not going to just let you backdoor our programs.
[03:29:42.120 --> 03:29:46.760]  The government is at war with even the major corporations now. I'm Anthony Gutiarty. We'll
[03:29:46.760 --> 03:29:52.120]  be right back with a lot more on the fourth hour. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.

[03:33:16.920 --> 03:33:24.840]  Welcome back. It's the Fourth Hour. I'm Anthony Gucciardi, your host for the remainder of the hour.
[03:33:24.840 --> 03:33:31.840]  And Mexican marijuana farmers see profits tumble as U.S. loosens laws. Gee, who would think?
[03:33:31.840 --> 03:33:40.840]  He started growing marijuana as a teenager and four decades later earned a modest living from his tiny plot tucked at the base of these rugged mountains of western Mexico.
[03:33:40.840 --> 03:33:48.840]  He proudly shows off his illegal plants, wastes high and fragrant, strategically hidden from view by rows of corn and nearly ready to be harvested.
[03:33:48.840 --> 03:33:58.840]  I've always liked this business producing marijuana. The 50-year-old farmer said, wistfully, he had decided that this season's crop would be his last. The reason? Free market economics.
[03:33:58.840 --> 03:34:09.840]  And this is from the LA Times. Here's someone that has been growing marijuana for decades and selling it to people in the United States from Mexico.
[03:34:09.840 --> 03:34:21.840]  But what's happened? Obviously states like Colorado and more lax in California means that, gee, the Mexican drug war is getting a little bit better, at least when it comes to shipping in the United States.
[03:34:21.840 --> 03:34:32.840]  Who would have thought? And again, even if you don't like marijuana or drugs, you know, it doesn't matter. The point is, less people do them. It becomes less of an issue, less crime associated with it.
[03:34:32.840 --> 03:34:40.840]  Anyway, moving on. Trans-Pacific trade deal bumps up health prices cost U.S. jobs. Gee, who told you about that?
[03:34:40.840 --> 03:34:54.840]  FBI offers $5,000 reward after bacon found at Vegas Mosque. The FBI is offering a $5,000 reward for information that helps them find the person who put raw bacon on the door handles of the Las Vegas Mosque.
[03:34:54.840 --> 03:35:04.840]  Agent Snap, Pakistanis with terrorist connections, crossing US border. Crime in Los Angeles rose in all categories in 2015, LAPD says.
[03:35:04.840 --> 03:35:13.840]  For the first time in more than a decade, all categories of crime rose across Los Angeles, and 2015, as police struggled to get control of the problem.
[03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:29.840]  Styrofoam ban begins in D.C. on Friday, and here's an interesting one. A rectile dysfunction linked to risk of early death, and not just, oh, you could die 5% more likely, 70% chance to die early.
[03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:33.840]  More likely to die early. A new study is found. And I've always thought about this.
[03:35:33.840 --> 03:35:45.840]  So, without getting into too much detail, you have to think about, really, your biological purpose, at least as far as your body's concerned, is to do what? Is to reproduce.
[03:35:45.840 --> 03:35:52.840]  So anything that infers with that reproductive capability, you have to imagine your body's putting most of its resources towards the reproduction.
[03:35:52.840 --> 03:36:03.840]  It's trying all it can to reproduce. So if something's wrong there, that implicates a bigger issue, and a lot of the times, ED has to do with heart issues.
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:15.840]  So anyone out there struggling with those types of things, I highly recommend you get on a serious health program and check out your heart big time, 70% more likely to die early, according to that study.
[03:36:15.840 --> 03:36:24.840]  On the flip side, we have some more AI news. Erika, the most beautiful and intelligent android, leads Japan's robot revolution.
[03:36:24.840 --> 03:36:31.840]  Although the day when every household has its own robot, is so my off, the Japanese are demonstrating a formidable acceptance of humanoids.
[03:36:31.840 --> 03:36:38.840]  And it goes on to talk about what she can do. When she's asked her age, she says, that's a slightly rude question. I'd rather not say.
[03:36:38.840 --> 03:36:47.840]  Interesting stuff. And it ties in with the president, presidential candidate, who claims technology to transform us into immortal cyborgs is within reach.
[03:36:47.840 --> 03:36:57.840]  And I think he was interviewed actually on the Info Wars Nightly News. Zoltan Isvan. Yeah, he was 10 years, a quadriplegic, what run an Olympian using robotics.
[03:36:57.840 --> 03:37:06.840]  And it also reminds me of the 2045 program where they say by 2045 will all be singularity AI robots with the power to dominate the world.
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:19.840]  And you know what, Elon Musk is a crazy technology foe that doesn't know what he's talking about when he says maybe we should keep in check some type of AI along with the 50 billion professors that agree with him.
[03:37:19.840 --> 03:37:28.840]  But hey, you know, he's afraid of technology. I'm going to open up the phone lines. And what I want to hear about is what you're going to do differently in 2016.
[03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:36.840]  What solutions you're going to enact to help change the world, what you're going to do in 2016 to make it a powerful year of victory.
[03:37:36.840 --> 03:37:49.840]  All right, I don't want to hear about necessarily the terrible things in 2015. I want to hear about 2016 being the best year full of solutions, what we're going to do because I'm going to present some ideas myself.
[03:37:49.840 --> 03:38:05.840]  The phone number is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. So let's get into these. This is my four ways to make 2016 your best year and four ways to change the world in 2016.
[03:38:05.840 --> 03:38:10.840]  First, let's talk about changing the world with real solutions in 2016.
[03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:18.840]  Number one, stop letting the mainstream media control the narrative. This is potentially one of the most important.
[03:38:18.840 --> 03:38:29.840]  Now, what do I mean by that? If you notice in our culture, the mainstream media still has got us fooled into thinking that they control the whole story.
[03:38:29.840 --> 03:38:38.840]  We're not allowed to think for ourselves. Still, even though we reject it, even though in polls it's been found over and over, Gallup polls, no one trusts the mainstream media.
[03:38:38.840 --> 03:38:47.840]  No one trusts Congress. No one trusts the president. The mainstream media still got us on the latch because we still watch it. We still absorb it.
[03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:55.840]  We still treat, don't treat our brain like our stomachs. And we watch the mainstream media and we let it hit us and we let them control the narrative.
[03:38:55.840 --> 03:39:02.840]  It's time to stop. It's time to stop giving them the credit. It's time to formulate your own opinions. And a lot of you are doing this.
[03:39:02.840 --> 03:39:13.840]  You know, I know most of this audience is super aware of what's going on. But I mean, in general, we need to stop letting them dominate us on social media in our social spaces.
[03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:26.840]  It's time to think for ourselves. Even if some of their narratives might even be true in some cases, it's time to formulate our own opinions without watching to the megalithic media networks for answers.
[03:39:26.840 --> 03:39:41.840]  It's time to form our own opinions. That's the first starting point. Number two, which I think is really the easiest one, is abolish political correctness in your life and watch as it's abolished in the lives of others.
[03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:52.840]  I've always said political correctness is now on the way out. It has gone too far. It has become too extreme and too ridiculous to wear certain color bags or racists and stuff.
[03:39:52.840 --> 03:39:59.840]  It's so absurd, especially to someone like me who actually loves humanity and loves people of all types and craziness, right?
[03:39:59.840 --> 03:40:06.840]  I really like everyone. I really love everyone to some degree. Even the most screwed up people, I have sympathy for them.
[03:40:06.840 --> 03:40:16.840]  I've read books on some of the most twisted historical figures you can imagine, and I still see humanity in them. No one is 100% pure evil.
[03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:24.840]  They all have parts of humanity in them and empathy that for whatever reason, through trauma in their life, they're suppressing and doing these absurd things.
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:30.840]  But political correctness is a form of verbal domination.
[03:40:30.840 --> 03:40:38.840]  So when you fall into the idea of political correctness as South Park has so geniusly and hilariously highlighted, you're being dominated verbally.
[03:40:38.840 --> 03:40:46.840]  When I come on the air and I'm afraid to say something that's not actually hurtful, this is the key part. It's not actually racist. It's not actually sexist.
[03:40:46.840 --> 03:40:55.840]  But I'm afraid to say something because it could be perceived as politically incorrect. That's a form of controlling my language on a false pretense.
[03:40:55.840 --> 03:41:03.840]  That's a form of dominating my ability to form sentences to you and dominating my ability to communicate and connect with you.
[03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:11.840]  So what happens, therefore, is people are stifled and stopped from their communication powers because of their fear of political correctness.
[03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:19.840]  That is, therefore, a control of the language, a control of our vocabulary that we've never seen in the likes of before.
[03:41:19.840 --> 03:41:27.840]  Because back in the day, you know, the king could say, I'm offended by this and you will stop. And they'll just, well, sure, we'll do it because we don't want to basically be killed.
[03:41:27.840 --> 03:41:31.840]  We don't want to offend the ruling class, the royalty. Oh, the royalty.
[03:41:31.840 --> 03:41:40.840]  But now people choose to do it themselves because they buy into the live political correctness. It's so easy to escape. Let's just get over it.
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:47.840]  Let's just get over it. Stop using it. Stop falling prey to it. It's not racist to say some silly things or sexist.
[03:41:47.840 --> 03:41:53.840]  And you know what? We all make jokes. We all say things. At the end of the day, stop buying into political correctness.
[03:41:53.840 --> 03:41:58.840]  Number three, stop identifying with preconceived schools of ideology.
[03:41:58.840 --> 03:42:05.840]  Stop basing all your opinions on what your school of thought that you have subscribed to says to do.
[03:42:05.840 --> 03:42:15.840]  Whether it's being a Republican, a moderate, a Democrat, or even some type of branch of, you know, some people follow their specific guru or whatever.
[03:42:15.840 --> 03:42:18.840]  And if he says something, they just, oh, well, you know, I agree.
[03:42:18.840 --> 03:42:23.840]  We all form these kind of silly ideas that we don't have any basis on.
[03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:29.840]  I'm guilty of all this myself, by the way. I'm not incriminating you. I'm saying, hey, we all do this. It's time to stop.
[03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:35.840]  We all feel like we have these ideas, but there's no foundation. We just kind of grab them from somewhere.
[03:42:35.840 --> 03:42:39.840]  It's kind of like running around a field and picking apples from a tree and just grabbing them randomly.
[03:42:39.840 --> 03:42:47.840]  A lot of people do that when they watch the news and their favorite talking head says something, or they feel like it's not Republican to say that.
[03:42:47.840 --> 03:42:56.840]  It's not very Republican to say what I'm about to say, so I'm going to change my belief system to conform with what I believe the Republicans would say.
[03:42:56.840 --> 03:43:07.840]  That's so absurd. Even if it's a good thing, always question. It's been said, and I really like this, have strong beliefs that are weakly held.
[03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:14.840]  Okay, it's not bad to change your mind. Advance your thinking. How dare you not conform to this Republican system?
[03:43:14.840 --> 03:43:21.840]  It doesn't matter. Have strong beliefs that are weakly held. Be willing to advance your opinion beyond this school of ideology that you subscribe to. It's absurd.
[03:43:21.840 --> 03:43:27.840]  Four, spread solutions and a message of victory instead of amplifying the media rhetoric.
[03:43:27.840 --> 03:43:34.840]  When I log on to social media and I look at the hundreds of thousands of individuals that I'm connected with,
[03:43:34.840 --> 03:43:39.840]  a lot of the stuff I see is good, is solutions oriented, is real news media.
[03:43:39.840 --> 03:43:47.840]  But a lot of it, a lot of people focus so much on attacking these specific stories that the media puts out.
[03:43:47.840 --> 03:44:00.840]  And it's all just about the media itself. It's like CNN did this, you know, Salon did this, all focusing on the media and what they said and making it more about the mainstream media.
[03:44:00.840 --> 03:44:09.840]  It's time to get away from the mainstream media and stop acting like they have control over our lives by giving them so much credit to obsess over them.
[03:44:09.840 --> 03:44:16.840]  Well, CNN said this, oh, Fox News said this, oh, no, no, no. Who cares? They don't have control over you.
[03:44:16.840 --> 03:44:26.840]  Become independent of that concept. Spread solutions and a message of victory and make it relate to people that aren't so informed as you.
[03:44:26.840 --> 03:44:32.840]  Not everyone is as informed as you. Sometimes it's the simplest things that can help people understand things.
[03:44:32.840 --> 03:44:36.840]  You don't have to hit them with these series of news bombs, right?
[03:44:36.840 --> 03:44:44.840]  Like, look, in 1964, this to this is just let people get to that point, but don't even, you know, assume everyone is on the same level as you.
[03:44:44.840 --> 03:44:53.840]  I'm going to go to some calls and then I want to go some news and four ways to individually make 2016 your best year and some other solutions and strategies.
[03:44:53.840 --> 03:44:58.840]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Tennessee. What's on your mind, Mike?
[03:44:58.840 --> 03:45:08.840]  Greetings. I want to encourage people to follow your lead and try to become independent, self-sufficient and learn the concepts of self-government.
[03:45:08.840 --> 03:45:15.840]  Because at the end of the day, you should be only relying on you and learn the fact that this is a corporate government.
[03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:19.840]  The United States government is a corporation. Every state is a corporation.
[03:45:19.840 --> 03:45:24.840]  If you learn these simple things, I do not consent. I do not wish to engage in commerce.
[03:45:24.840 --> 03:45:29.840]  That stops the beast at the door. They can't engage in commerce. They can't proceed.
[03:45:29.840 --> 03:45:32.840]  And if they can't proceed, they can't deal with you.
[03:45:32.840 --> 03:45:39.840]  That will free up so many people from these prisons that it would be an amazing thing for people to realize.
[03:45:39.840 --> 03:45:49.840]  Right to my mind around this, folks, it is a corporation. It's Walmart. It is now what you think the original does your government. It's been gone since 1871.
[03:45:49.840 --> 03:45:58.840]  So waking up to the truth, instead of shaking people away, just tickle them, just give them information because they're coming on board.
[03:45:58.840 --> 03:46:08.840]  And I believe this will be the year that there's an epiphany where people will spontaneously react to the truth and eventually we can stop feeding this beast.
[03:46:08.840 --> 03:46:16.840]  Keep your money in your pocket. Obey the top ten. Love your neighbor as it is. Love your God and yourself.
[03:46:16.840 --> 03:46:26.840]  And do the right thing and the light will shine. The darkness will drop off and become a thing of the past and we can become Americans once again.
[03:46:26.840 --> 03:46:30.840]  Beautifully said, Mike. And you know, you said two things that really resonated with me.
[03:46:30.840 --> 03:46:35.840]  First and foremost is the idea of a prison that you're in.
[03:46:35.840 --> 03:46:41.840]  And this is really important. I call it a box, a mental ideological box, but a prison is actually an even better term.
[03:46:41.840 --> 03:46:50.840]  How many prisons are you putting yourself in? Self-made prisons because, look, you have to decide to go into the prison and close the door.
[03:46:50.840 --> 03:46:57.840]  You have to decide to go into the cell, the ideological cell. All these points I'm talking about, you have to decide to let it affect you.
[03:46:57.840 --> 03:47:01.840]  You have to decide to let the media affect you and run your narrative and control your life.
[03:47:01.840 --> 03:47:09.840]  You have to decide that you want to be normal. You want to be accepted and societally okay and follow political correctness.
[03:47:09.840 --> 03:47:19.840]  What you're doing is you're closing the prison cell on your brain. You're putting yourself into so many different prisons when you aren't independent of all of this.
[03:47:19.840 --> 03:47:27.840]  And you also said something that I think is truly beautiful, although something along the lines of 2016 is the year of awakening.
[03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:39.840]  Because for how many years have we all as grassroots movements and thought leaders like Alex been pushing out information, right?
[03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:46.840]  Years and years and years. The information I believe is out there. I believe the information is already out there and a lot of people are aware of it.
[03:47:46.840 --> 03:47:56.840]  The age of informing is still here, but it's more along the lines of the age now of action and awakening is 2016.
[03:47:56.840 --> 03:48:05.840]  You see, enough people are informed at this point when the line goes up that a certain level you're then going into the age of solutions and action.
[03:48:05.840 --> 03:48:13.840]  And I think 2016 may be that year. Let's go to Gary in Pennsylvania. Gary, what do you think about 2016?
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:28.840]  I just want to say thank you for what you guys do. God bless everybody, including the listeners and you guys and Alex and everyone, but I have four main things that I want to do. The first thing, of course, is going to be profess and continue to spread the amazing, loving news of Jesus Christ,
[03:48:28.840 --> 03:48:36.840]  not in a non-religious but loving way. Because it's not really about religion, it's about love and that's really what the big thing is here.
[03:48:36.840 --> 03:48:44.840]  Number two, I want to get more info towards bumper stickers. Right now, I've had my 9-11 was an inside job in my score. There's poison in the tap water bumper stickers.
[03:48:44.840 --> 03:48:53.840]  And I see people every time looking at my bumper sticker in the rear-view mirror and it's just awesome to see people seeing it. You definitely know it's waking them up. It's just a good feeling to have those.
[03:48:53.840 --> 03:49:01.840]  I want to get some more of those. Number three is going to stop eating processed food. Completely, I would like to stop eating Chipotle.
[03:49:01.840 --> 03:49:09.840]  I love Chipotle, I know they say it's not GMO or whatever, but I would like to stop. And then number four is just going to continue to be generous to everybody.
[03:49:09.840 --> 03:49:16.840]  Opening doors, helping somebody on the side of the highway, changing the tires. Do a little, tiny little act that you would think don't mean anything or else.
[03:49:16.840 --> 03:49:22.840]  Somebody else will help. Help the old lady with her cane stuck at Walmart in the parking lot. I mean, that's the way that it should be done.
[03:49:22.840 --> 03:49:26.840]  Just love in general, some more love, I guess you could say.
[03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:37.840]  You're right, it does mean something to do little acts like that, micro acts. It does mean something because one of the issues I actually have with almost every single movement is it's always about the political spectrum of something like,
[03:49:37.840 --> 03:49:44.840]  well, we just have to inform people and do a lot of stuff. And I agree, it's such a powerful point. But let's also remember our humanity, right?
[03:49:44.840 --> 03:49:48.840]  Because it's the littlest actions that foretell the largest actions in our lives.
[03:49:48.840 --> 03:49:56.840]  If we can't be nice enough to open the door for an old woman, how are we supposed to spread love and information to other people?
[03:49:56.840 --> 03:50:08.840]  If we can't actually be nice to a stranger, if we can't actually help someone that maybe doesn't get something and therefore doesn't understand the full spectrum of information you're presenting to them,
[03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:13.840]  you know, how can we overall, in a larger meta perspective, do what we need to do?
[03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:23.840]  And I want to talk a little bit more about that when they come back. Also, I want to talk about the secret about New Year's Eve and Christmas that you're not going to hear anywhere else.
[03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:28.840]  And the four solutions to make 2016 your best year and some more news as well.
[03:50:28.840 --> 03:50:34.840]  And, you know, I'm honored once again to be part of this last broadcast on the Alex Jones show of 2015.
[03:50:34.840 --> 03:50:39.840]  And we're going to make this next segment really come out, count and take the rest of your calls when we come back.
[03:50:39.840 --> 03:50:43.840]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi. Thanks so much. Stay tuned.
[03:50:43.840 --> 03:51:09.840]  My name is Don Wiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:09.840 --> 03:51:18.840]  What did I do? I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:18.840 --> 03:51:27.840]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:27.840 --> 03:51:32.840]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:32.840 --> 03:51:42.840]  I'm 60 years old now, and I still work every day. To get your Extendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.

[03:51:59.840 --> 03:52:08.840]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and mega corporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[03:52:08.840 --> 03:52:14.840]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[03:52:14.840 --> 03:52:23.840]  The numbers are staggering. In the past five years alone, $41 billion of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[03:52:23.840 --> 03:52:26.840]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our backpockets.

[03:54:22.840 --> 03:54:33.840]  We went over my four ways to change the world in 2016, and I also want to talk about a secret behind New Year's, Christmas, and really all of the holidays.
[03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:37.840]  And this is one that I don't think I've heard anyone else say.
[03:54:37.840 --> 03:54:44.840]  So we all know about the holiday spirit, right? The joy of the holiday spirit. Some people look forward to it all year. It is a beautiful thing.
[03:54:44.840 --> 03:54:52.840]  We talk about people holding doors for old women. We talk about people spending time choosing gifts for their friends and family, right?
[03:54:52.840 --> 03:54:59.840]  Not the corporate hijacked part of it, where they turned it into kind of like a monopoly game on how much money you could spend.
[03:54:59.840 --> 03:55:04.840]  And if you don't spend enough money and buy the latest electronics for your friends and family, well, you're a bad person.
[03:55:04.840 --> 03:55:11.840]  I'm not talking about that corporation hijack that went on. I'm talking about the true holiday spirit.
[03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:18.840]  The idea of just being a little bit kinder to people, being a little bit nicer, not bumping in line, or letting someone get in front of you.
[03:55:18.840 --> 03:55:22.840]  It's the holidays, right? It's the holiday spirit. We have to be nicer.
[03:55:22.840 --> 03:55:27.840]  Well, I both love that, and I have a huge issue with that, and I'll tell you why that is.
[03:55:27.840 --> 03:55:32.840]  Because the holiday spirit is a lie. It's actually the human spirit.
[03:55:32.840 --> 03:55:41.840]  And for some reason, we only turn it on for 24 to 42 hours or a week or two around Christmas time or New Year's or whatever.
[03:55:41.840 --> 03:55:45.840]  And here's what that shows. Here's the big secret about that.
[03:55:45.840 --> 03:55:53.840]  That shows us. That shows humanity. That shows me. That shows you that it's not a holiday spirit.
[03:55:53.840 --> 03:56:03.840]  It's actually people trying to be nicer and trying to be more empathetic and more real and express their human spirit, their human spirit,
[03:56:03.840 --> 03:56:09.840]  of love and passion and caring for a period of time.
[03:56:09.840 --> 03:56:15.840]  And then when the holidays are gone, some people turn it off. They become mean again. They become hard again.
[03:56:15.840 --> 03:56:19.840]  It's not Christmas anymore. It's a New Year, right?
[03:56:19.840 --> 03:56:28.840]  Why don't we have it on all year? Why don't we have that holiday spirit 364 other days of the year instead of one day per year?
[03:56:28.840 --> 03:56:36.840]  Because people don't turn it on. They just act like it's the holidays. I'll be nice to someone. No, that should be on every single day.
[03:56:36.840 --> 03:56:43.840]  We need to turn that on every day. Express the full spectrum of human emotion, reality and the human spirit every single day instead of just Christmas.
[03:56:43.840 --> 03:56:50.840]  So I'm tired of it. And at the same time, the holiday spirit is beautiful. It's also a lie because you have it in you every single day.
[03:56:50.840 --> 03:56:54.840]  To actually do something and care about your friends and family and care about other people.
[03:56:54.840 --> 03:57:01.840]  And that is the truth about all holidays. And remember that and tell someone that because you can be like that every day.
[03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:08.840]  We could all be like that to each other every single day. It's not a magical thing that happens on Christmas. Santa doesn't bring it into your chimney.
[03:57:08.840 --> 03:57:17.840]  Okay, you can do that any time of year. Alright, we're almost out of time. I'm going to go through my list four ways to make 2016 your best year.
[03:57:17.840 --> 03:57:24.840]  Really listen to this. Number one is change your consumption. Treat your brain like your stomach. Stop watching the mainstream media garbage.
[03:57:24.840 --> 03:57:34.840]  Consider it like a loss of energy every single time you watch it. I mean, if you're sitting there watching television all day and I'm not judging people, I'm really not.
[03:57:34.840 --> 03:57:39.840]  I've been there. I've done these things. Sometimes it's fun to watch television to relax or whatever, but you need to change your consumption.
[03:57:39.840 --> 03:57:50.840]  80-20 rule. 80% of your consumption needs to be good, real news, positive solutions, empowerment, right? People that want you to succeed.
[03:57:50.840 --> 03:57:58.840]  People that want you to live. Stop watching people that want to take control of you. Stop being afraid of change, advancing your mindset.
[03:57:58.840 --> 03:58:06.840]  It's okay to have new ideas and concepts. You're not changing. You're advancing your mindset. If you change on an issue, it's not a big thing. It's not a bad deal.
[03:58:06.840 --> 03:58:12.840]  Drop the idea of being normal. Who wants to be normal in this world? And align yourself with your mission and your passion.
[03:58:12.840 --> 03:58:19.840]  You're not happy if you're working a 95 job and you're cubicle doing nothing you love. Spend 20 minutes every single day doing something that matters for the world.
[03:58:19.840 --> 03:58:31.840]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi. Thanks so much for watching this broadcast. The Alex Jones Show, this is the fourth hour of Overdrive, and Alex will be back in 2016 to tell you what's coming up in the news on Sunday.
[03:58:31.840 --> 03:58:51.840]  Thanks so much for watching.
