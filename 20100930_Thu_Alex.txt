[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:32.000]  we are live ladies and gentlemen Thursday the 30th day of September 2010 Dr. Doug
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.080]  Ronke will be joining us coming up the third hour the former head of the Army
[00:37.080 --> 00:42.520]  and the Pentagon's depleted uranium weapons program to tell you just how
[00:42.520 --> 00:46.920]  deadly this stuff is and how they're covering up the incredible health
[00:46.920 --> 00:51.440]  effects and cancers and deaths that it's causing in the military that uses it
[00:51.440 --> 00:57.920]  not to mention the 14-time increase in cancers in Fallujah with the people that
[00:57.920 --> 01:04.840]  live in and around areas bombarded by it speaking of radiation big success
[01:04.840 --> 01:09.600]  yesterday and this is why we do this and yesterday was a big success we had
[01:09.600 --> 01:13.760]  listeners search the term feds radiating Americans and folks give me a
[01:13.760 --> 01:18.720]  document cam shot for prison planet TV viewers look at these headlines feds
[01:18.720 --> 01:25.280]  rating and feds radiating Americans mobile x-ray vans hit US streets
[01:25.280 --> 01:31.480]  Christian science monitor and it literally lifts entire paragraphs of Paul
[01:31.480 --> 01:36.560]  Joseph Watson's report talking about the warrantless checkpoint in Atlanta the
[01:36.560 --> 01:41.400]  fact that they're driving by radiating your houses and the different reports
[01:41.400 --> 01:46.640]  about how dangerous these x-rays are and how this is a new precedent so no
[01:46.640 --> 01:52.600]  credit to us but I don't care the point is that this is getting wide attention
[01:52.600 --> 01:56.480]  by more than 20 newspapers and major publications here's Christian science
[01:56.480 --> 02:02.720]  monitor here's yahoo news feds radiating Americans big report same thing
[02:02.720 --> 02:10.200]  feds radiating Americans with scanners at road checkpoints is it true AOL news
[02:10.200 --> 02:15.920]  and they said yes Alex Jones is correct it is true without warrants and it's
[02:15.920 --> 02:22.240]  dangerous to those running the machines and those being hit by it I mean just
[02:22.240 --> 02:28.240]  literally more than 20 major publications picking up on the search term
[02:28.240 --> 02:33.480]  conservatively hundreds and hundreds of thousands of additional people seeing
[02:33.480 --> 02:38.120]  these stories now and I know how the media cycle works this is going to now
[02:38.120 --> 02:46.120]  spur a cascade in the next few weeks of big articles and will cause a
[02:46.120 --> 02:50.120]  national debate now you're going to be seeing it on Glenn Beck and everywhere
[02:50.120 --> 02:56.200]  else and that's good about the mobile x-ray scanners the airport scanners going
[02:56.200 --> 03:00.400]  in mobile vans where when you go to a rock concert there have these big giant
[03:00.400 --> 03:05.560]  18-wheeler tractor trailers that they force thousands of people through to
[03:05.560 --> 03:10.080]  get into sporting events this is now going to cause a major debate about this
[03:10.080 --> 03:14.240]  instead of it just being implemented and then it's in a few local newspapers
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.240]  you know when they set up checkpoints and make you drive through them this is
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.200]  going to cause a big national debate about England already putting up
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.800]  scanners on light poles that just just blast through your clothes as you walk
[03:26.800 --> 03:33.400]  by them they're now calling for that here so just amazing job listeners feds
[03:33.400 --> 03:38.320]  radiating Americans mobile x-ray vans hit US streets Christian Science Monitor
[03:38.320 --> 03:48.600]  AOL news Yahoo news the list just go on and on and on so very very exciting good
[03:48.600 --> 03:54.040]  job to everyone out there that made that happen and coming up later when I have
[03:54.040 --> 03:57.600]  time to get back into this with some new developments here's popular science
[03:57.600 --> 04:06.200]  1927 the August issue and it says US air marshals yes all about the police
[04:06.200 --> 04:11.200]  taking to the airways to stop alcohol which they of course were getting paid
[04:11.200 --> 04:14.680]  off by the mafia that's why the government made alcohol illegal was to
[04:14.680 --> 04:18.760]  boost the prices that was also their plan with heroin and they did that as
[04:18.760 --> 04:21.840]  well still illegal and they make much larger profits and there's more of it
[04:21.840 --> 04:28.160]  on the streets because of it but it says x-rays ferret out rum so what is old is
[04:28.160 --> 04:33.800]  new we're going to be discussing that but they had to stop because well the
[04:33.800 --> 04:38.880]  federal marshals and local police using the x-ray machines they didn't live too
[04:38.880 --> 04:45.920]  long but hey so what if some cops die so what if some military die so what if
[04:45.920 --> 04:48.720]  some Homeland Security die they're gonna at least have fun radiating
[04:48.720 --> 04:53.480]  citizens so they get to give what they get the government thinks we're so
[04:53.480 --> 04:57.440]  stupid they're rolling this out everywhere so enjoy your ten times the
[04:57.440 --> 05:01.360]  chest x-ray every time they blast you this is Alex Jones with five good
[05:01.360 --> 05:05.360]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new

[05:17.480 --> 05:21.720]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[05:21.720 --> 05:25.720]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.840]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[05:29.840 --> 05:33.800]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[05:33.800 --> 05:37.960]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:37.960 --> 05:41.760]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[05:41.760 --> 05:45.280]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[08:15.720 --> 08:19.640]  after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on
[08:19.640 --> 08:24.480]  the pages of history since the beginning of time it has refinements
[08:24.480 --> 08:28.740]  technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the
[08:28.740 --> 08:33.160]  destruction of human freedom but like every one of the super states that
[08:33.160 --> 08:41.200]  preceded it it has one iron rule logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[08:41.200 --> 08:59.040]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[08:59.040 --> 09:11.800]  hail all liberty lovers skull which I guess in Viking means readings to everyone
[09:11.800 --> 09:17.280]  out there who loves liberty and freedom and who doesn't want to be a slave thank

[09:27.360 --> 09:35.840]  as I'm on this Norse line I would just add that cattle die and kinsman die but
[09:35.840 --> 09:39.400]  I know there's one thing that never dies and that is the fame of a dead man's
[09:39.400 --> 09:44.240]  deeds we'll never forget George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and
[09:44.240 --> 09:48.960]  others who fought tyranny and believe me ladies and gentlemen the great war

[09:59.600 --> 10:04.320]  defend liberty and freedom against the scientific dictatorship there is
[10:04.320 --> 10:12.320]  another off-the-charts article at prisonplanet.com the government has
[10:12.320 --> 10:16.040]  gone from lying and saying they weren't wiretapping anybody without warrants in
[10:16.040 --> 10:20.440]  this country to admitting they are scooping up everything you do emails
[10:20.440 --> 10:26.560]  faxes phone calls all being run through giant NSA and literally hundreds of
[10:26.560 --> 10:32.760]  other private contracting agencies breaking the law in mass none of it has
[10:32.760 --> 10:39.280]  anything to do with fighting al-CIA to al-Qaeda groups around the world it's
[10:39.280 --> 10:43.320]  all about you and your family as Cass Sunstein at the White House and others
[10:43.320 --> 10:47.200]  have said as the Mayak report Homeland Security reports clearly demonstrate
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.800]  and you know about the Israeli companies and other private groups spying on
[10:51.800 --> 10:55.200]  Americans being paid by federal and state Homeland Security compiling the
[10:55.200 --> 10:59.240]  names of state representatives mainline second amendment groups land rights
[10:59.240 --> 11:04.920]  groups anti-war groups anybody politically active this is the secret
[11:04.920 --> 11:10.000]  police network now set up and they've got the snatch and grab teams grabbing
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.520]  people in front of news cameras and putting bags over their heads in Canada
[11:13.520 --> 11:19.040]  the US and England at g20 events to scare you police have been caught all
[11:19.040 --> 11:25.560]  over the world Denver Post Toronto Star reporting on police caught attacking
[11:25.560 --> 11:29.600]  their own officers as the pretext to then attack peaceful crowds of
[11:29.600 --> 11:35.720]  demonstrators this is a government run for and by bloodthirsty psychopathic
[11:35.720 --> 11:40.280]  greedy control freaks and when we finally realize that we'll have some
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.560]  chance of beating these people they have armies though of useful idiots in
[11:44.560 --> 11:50.280]  corporate America and in government who are compartmentalized and believe the
[11:50.280 --> 11:54.440]  false download cover stories they're given for why they're doing what they're
[11:54.440 --> 11:58.760]  doing and I've since gotten some more intel confirming what a former TSA
[11:58.760 --> 12:02.040]  officer told us about yesterday that in the last two months they've been giving
[12:02.040 --> 12:07.640]  them all verbal questionnaires as they read down the questionnaire saying are
[12:07.640 --> 12:11.800]  you for the naked body scanners you know will you put people through them will you
[12:11.800 --> 12:15.560]  force everyone through them the TSA told the Chicago Tribune four months ago
[12:15.560 --> 12:19.200]  they do plan to make it mandatory for all El Paso Times reports going back
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.240]  three months ago they're already trying to force everyone in El Paso and they
[12:23.240 --> 12:29.440]  know they can force you to go into a radiation bath if they know if they can
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.320]  let you know they're saving the images of your naked body you will submit to
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.920]  anything next is going to be DNA taking checkpoints on highways everywhere
[12:37.920 --> 12:43.320]  already being federally rolled out the name of DUI next they will implement the
[12:43.320 --> 12:48.480]  executive order from back in 1994 by Bill Clinton for urine and blood testing
[12:48.480 --> 12:51.960]  it's already on the books to take your urine your blood or other tissue samples
[12:51.960 --> 12:58.920]  to get a driver's license it is here it is here ladies and gentlemen it's not
[12:58.920 --> 13:05.520]  coming it's here authorities plan to troll phone calls for emails for signs of
[13:05.520 --> 13:12.200]  resentment towards the government prisonplanet.com what did the Buffalo
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.320]  news just in fact guys I couldn't find it my stack yesterday for Monday will you
[13:16.320 --> 13:21.160]  reprint me that Buffalo news report about forget the exact headline about how
[13:21.160 --> 13:28.200]  the police are meeting with the feds to get pre-crime databases and to watch
[13:28.200 --> 13:32.320]  individuals for signs they might be unhappy with the government because that
[13:32.320 --> 13:38.880]  dovetails with Watson's article but here it is face crime orwellian
[13:38.880 --> 13:43.400]  technology seeks identified disgruntled Americans as terrorist and the quote is
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.960]  resentment towards government the federal government is announcing that
[13:48.960 --> 13:52.040]  they're gonna have loudspeakers everywhere just like in the airport
[13:52.040 --> 13:56.960]  America will be like the airport we're now at a orange alert orange alert
[13:56.960 --> 14:01.560]  there'll be guys with German shepherds walking around when I was in the
[14:01.560 --> 14:07.280]  Atlanta airport earlier this month with Jesse Ventura it was literally police
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.760]  dogs people bugging their eyes out at you constant announcements of orange alert
[14:11.760 --> 14:17.240]  high threat of terrorist watch watch everywhere look out I mean like out of a
[14:17.240 --> 14:22.360]  science fiction movie I'm living in 2010 it's a nightmare orwellian state we're
[14:22.360 --> 14:30.280]  being immersed into and the cameras are watching you and if you look a little
[14:30.280 --> 14:33.000]  upset when you hear the announcements that will now be blaring on street
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.880]  corners everywhere it's already happening in England or if you get stopped by the
[14:37.880 --> 14:40.880]  secret police they already have this in England now rolling out here and they
[14:40.880 --> 14:43.320]  come up and ask you if you're a terrorist or ask you what you think about
[14:43.320 --> 14:46.560]  the government they're gonna have a handheld camera watching your expressions
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.720]  oh your expression folks you cannot make the magnitude of this up this is a
[14:51.720 --> 14:57.720]  psychological warfare dictatorship run by a bunch of degenerates who get off on
[14:57.720 --> 15:02.480]  dominating you we are going into total bondage we're being dog trained right
[15:02.480 --> 15:08.080]  now do you resent the government for enforcing Obamacare or raising your
[15:08.080 --> 15:11.480]  taxes write about it in an email or talk about it on the phone you could be
[15:11.480 --> 15:14.880]  placing a surveillance as a potential terrorist if frightening new technology
[15:14.880 --> 15:17.800]  being shopped the law enforcement agencies implemented it's already
[15:17.800 --> 15:21.680]  implemented and see now they want to announce this so you get scared and just
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.840]  shut up and go into your box no ladies and gentlemen we're all on list
[15:25.840 --> 15:30.240]  especially those of you that work for the system you better come out and say
[15:30.240 --> 15:38.360]  I'm good you're bad you are terrorist criminals forget pre-crime and get ready
[15:38.360 --> 15:41.680]  for face crime big brother is set to unleash a new wave of shockingly
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.720]  invasive and Orwellian technology the American people in a recent symposium in
[15:45.720 --> 15:49.800]  Hamburg New York is anything to go by in fact Watson's actually linked to the
[15:49.800 --> 15:54.640]  Buffalo story federal agencies police departments and others were all in
[15:54.640 --> 15:58.680]  attendance to see and demonstrate of system that trolls phone conversations
[15:58.680 --> 16:05.400]  imagine the cops are there this is in the Buffalo news there it is
[16:05.400 --> 16:10.760]  technology identifies trouble individuals and the cops are being told in
[16:10.760 --> 16:14.360]  these meetings going on all over the country that we're the federal government
[16:14.360 --> 16:17.880]  and we're listening to all the phone calls I mean that's felonies right out
[16:17.880 --> 16:23.400]  in the open the government people admitting that they're doing this should
[16:23.400 --> 16:28.720]  be instantly clapped in irons and arrested because the crime has been
[16:28.720 --> 16:35.120]  committed in front of you the grand jury should indict immediately but no most
[16:35.120 --> 16:38.640]  those cops are in there on power trips and got all their gear and feel real
[16:38.640 --> 16:43.720]  good and Jack Bowers your hero and America's good and New York's a big

[16:58.480 --> 17:02.120]  questionnaires you know will you do you like spying on people without warrants
[17:02.120 --> 17:05.080]  and most cops are like yeah love it's freedom they're like you're going all
[17:05.080 --> 17:10.200]  the way to the top pal you've got an IQ of room temperature you're gonna be a

[17:17.560 --> 17:21.440]  running an x-ray system for 10 years you'll never even think of that or you
[17:21.440 --> 17:26.000]  go into the doctor you'll say doc I heard these x-rays were bad but I thought it

[24:09.720 --> 24:15.400]  even more has come out so I'm going to be covering that later in the hour
[24:15.400 --> 24:20.400]  we've got the feds saying that they're desperately trying to protect us from
[24:20.400 --> 24:25.920]  an imminent terror attack meanwhile we have all these government experts saying
[24:25.920 --> 24:29.920]  we've got a stage something publicly because they think you're so stupid you
[24:29.920 --> 24:35.360]  won't notice I'll be going over that but it's very very simple they do
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.400]  departmental test and government corporations big ones to find out who's
[24:40.400 --> 24:45.920]  moral and who is immoral and they're using all this tracking software to
[24:45.920 --> 24:49.720]  actually find out who's criminal who's psychopathic who's sadistic to go out
[24:49.720 --> 24:54.480]  and recruit a army of darkness and they've done it and they're now swelling
[24:54.480 --> 24:59.680]  the ranks of literally the army of Mordor against free humanity
[24:59.680 --> 25:04.080]  meanwhile they take the good guys that say oh you passed the test in the army
[25:04.080 --> 25:10.840]  you won't do corrupt things you're gonna be in maintenance now there were two
[25:10.840 --> 25:15.560]  trillion dollars missing on September 10 2001 that was announced
[25:15.560 --> 25:23.680]  Associated Press it was over 4 trillion by 2006 five and a half years later now
[25:23.680 --> 25:31.080]  it's unknown that's how much they've stolen money just disappearing what is
[25:31.080 --> 25:35.280]  national security the National Security Act of 1947 who set up the CIA
[25:35.280 --> 25:42.160]  skull and bones a opium mafia and that's an encyclopedia skull and bones was
[25:42.160 --> 25:48.000]  founded for the importation of opium it was a cartel it was legal then that's
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.800]  where the Roosevelt's made their money and they've been operating with total
[25:54.800 --> 25:58.480]  secrecy with unlimited money and they control the narcotics trafficking
[25:58.480 --> 26:03.400]  everything they are the mafia that runs the entire stinking show and they
[26:03.400 --> 26:06.600]  themselves work for the big mega central banks the Rothschilds the
[26:06.600 --> 26:12.560]  Rockefellers every globalist mischief every new war every carbon tax every
[26:12.560 --> 26:18.360]  form of evil for sterilization poisoned vaccines always leads back to the
[26:18.360 --> 26:23.000]  Rockefellers and the Rothschilds the Council on Foreign Relations thousands
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.320]  of public documents where they admit world government collectivism poisoning
[26:27.320 --> 26:34.880]  vaccines it's all public but they know the sheep-like public cannot admit this
[26:34.880 --> 26:40.560]  to themselves because it's so frightening see I'm bold I have courage
[26:40.560 --> 26:44.840]  because I know that if we don't beat these people all of us are enslaved or
[26:44.840 --> 26:50.320]  worse and I know if they kill me it'll underline and highlight everything I've
[26:50.320 --> 26:54.080]  said and done doesn't mean they still might not do it but at the end of the
[26:54.080 --> 26:58.760]  day I don't really care I want to live I don't want to die but I want freedom
[26:58.760 --> 27:03.400]  for my species for my family for you more than I want to live you understand
[27:03.400 --> 27:07.040]  that and the globalists don't know how to deal with that they can't buy us off
[27:07.040 --> 27:13.200]  they can't intimidate us they can't back us off and they can't what's the line
[27:13.200 --> 27:20.440]  from a country boy can survive because they can't starve us out and they can't
[27:20.440 --> 27:26.840]  make us run because these old boys were raised on shotguns we say grace we say
[27:26.840 --> 27:32.400]  amen I mean it comes down to that at the end of the day ladies and gentlemen
[27:32.400 --> 27:39.400]  because once you sell out to evil once you agree to it the bottom falls out and
[27:39.400 --> 27:45.480]  that's why they sell all this degeneracy and and and just sickening stuff
[27:45.480 --> 27:51.440]  all over radio and TV and the most bestial stuff it gets more and more
[27:51.440 --> 27:56.640]  corrupt it's being done by design so that no one can differentiate good from
[27:56.640 --> 28:00.920]  evil and all the simulated violence and death mixed with real death on
[28:00.920 --> 28:08.360]  television until people find it as a form of entertainment being artificially or
[28:08.360 --> 28:16.240]  synthetically turned into quasi sociopath psychopath sadist like our rulers they
[28:16.240 --> 28:22.160]  are turning our political our spiritual our sociological atmosphere into hell
[28:22.160 --> 28:29.880]  on earth hell on earth the feminist movement on record was to get women at
[28:29.880 --> 28:32.880]  working so the state would raise the children so they could increase the
[28:32.880 --> 28:37.080]  taxes and bankrupt society and destroy the family they've done an almost complete
[28:37.080 --> 28:45.720]  job they're there to destroy and in the process of destruction take over the
[28:45.720 --> 28:51.120]  system it's a slash and burn program to destroy our industry to destroy our
[28:51.120 --> 28:56.160]  sovereignty and the same program is being used worldwide and ancient cultures
[28:56.160 --> 28:59.960]  which many times have their own oppressive systems but it's not high
[28:59.960 --> 29:05.840]  tech oppression are many times more healthy than this focused scientific
[29:05.840 --> 29:12.520]  evil that's why the globalist hate the Muslims so much because they can't get
[29:12.520 --> 29:17.720]  them sterilized they can't get them to go along with their program unless it's
[29:17.720 --> 29:24.120]  the British colony of Saudi Arabia which is of course the most degenerate and the
[29:24.120 --> 29:29.320]  quote most religiously oppressive so that's the beta test of the model they
[29:29.320 --> 29:32.680]  want for the rest of the Middle East so is Egypt to a certain extent when we
[29:32.680 --> 29:36.760]  come back we're getting into all this amazing news ladies and gentlemen they're

[34:45.760 --> 34:52.680]  something the women if you go back to Edward Bernays in the 20s they said
[34:52.680 --> 34:57.320]  openly and published they would break up the family they would advertise to women
[34:57.320 --> 35:03.080]  that it was radical risk a avant-garde to be sexually promiscuous to not have a
[35:03.080 --> 35:08.360]  husband to abort your baby in a back alley to take birth control Rockefeller
[35:08.360 --> 35:13.400]  Foundation funded all of that through Margaret Sanger and now look what
[35:13.400 --> 35:18.120]  feminism's done it's turned women into purely sexual objects men aren't men

[35:46.920 --> 35:51.520]  of their children it's fulfilling it's what humans are designed to do it's what
[35:51.520 --> 35:57.960]  our entire civilization is built around and the system is atomizing that it's
[35:57.960 --> 36:08.080]  disintegrating it it's destroying it by design you like the results oh there are
[36:08.080 --> 36:15.440]  bad men out there they're bad women but women need a good strong man who's got
[36:15.440 --> 36:19.800]  his head screwed on straight to protect them and women need to be trained as they
[36:19.800 --> 36:25.600]  were to defend themselves as well you think the government's your friend women
[36:25.600 --> 36:34.680]  I'll assure you it's not all right I want to start getting into the news I've
[36:34.680 --> 36:41.200]  got the financial stack here US is practically owned by China CNBC China's

[37:49.440 --> 37:54.720]  year and best September in 70 years you know why because those stocks are having
[37:54.720 --> 37:59.360]  the bailout money dumped into them by big institutions and a devalued dollar
[37:59.360 --> 38:02.760]  and other global currencies are purchasing those stocks so those stocks
[38:02.760 --> 38:07.600]  really aren't up it's like gold's not really up currencies are down part of
[38:07.600 --> 38:16.320]  this g20 concerted coordinated devaluation to use their term we've
[38:16.320 --> 38:19.840]  got this incredible article by Paul Joseph Watson where they have giant
[38:19.840 --> 38:23.400]  police symposiums admitting everything you're doing is being tracked and traced
[38:23.400 --> 38:29.840]  by the government and that of your emails phone calls text messages show any
[38:29.840 --> 38:32.960]  criticism or resentment towards the government you're put on a list and
[38:32.960 --> 38:36.760]  surveilled and so what are you supposed to do now just just go oh well I better
[38:36.760 --> 38:40.360]  not criticize the government even though that's the bedrock of what this country
[38:40.360 --> 38:43.800]  was founded on and what it's all about this government is alien this government
[38:43.800 --> 38:51.440]  is a criminal corporate overlay to rob us you understand trillions and
[38:51.440 --> 38:55.320]  trillions and trillions and trillions are missing from the Pentagon and every
[38:55.320 --> 38:59.600]  year Congress ask where it is and the Pentagon literally laughs at them and
[38:59.600 --> 39:05.280]  says we won't tell you just like the Federal Reserve it's a joke you know I
[39:05.280 --> 39:08.040]  see all these good old boys and all these young people with this primitive
[39:08.040 --> 39:12.000]  form of patriotism an American flag they go join the military they're shot up
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.640]  with experimental vaccines they breathe depleted uranium those that are
[39:17.640 --> 39:21.160]  immoral are recruited into black ops to commit every crime you can imagine and
[39:21.160 --> 39:25.360]  run organized crime worldwide the rest are turned into deadly do-rights to go
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.400]  out and write tickets as police officers to then funded into the mega bank
[39:30.400 --> 39:34.840]  derivative scam this is full spectrum global domination it's not an army with
[39:34.840 --> 39:38.480]  tanks that rolls over the hill it's an enemy that comes and whispers in your
[39:38.480 --> 39:45.120]  ear and people better get that through their head I had all these military
[39:45.120 --> 39:49.480]  people calling about how do you use killing them how they're sterilized how
[39:49.480 --> 39:54.240]  they're dying how they got cancer they kept saying yeah the government didn't
[39:54.240 --> 39:57.920]  care about us no no no they do care about you they care about hurting you
[39:57.920 --> 40:02.880]  they want to hurt you they do care it's not that they don't care and just let

[40:11.160 --> 40:15.680]  damage and failure and cancer and sterilization but it's just that the
[40:15.680 --> 40:21.080]  big agra doesn't care big GMO doesn't care that they're designing them to do
[40:21.080 --> 40:26.680]  that I have their own reports that we link to daily at info wars.com and
[40:26.680 --> 40:30.920]  prisonplanet.com what is it you don't get about that okay what is it you don't
[40:30.920 --> 40:34.800]  get about the fact that they've got federal laws for x-ray machines at a
[40:34.800 --> 40:39.320]  dental office or in a medical center and they've got systems many times more
[40:39.320 --> 40:43.520]  powerful and they've got cops and feds and private contractors running them
[40:43.520 --> 40:51.360]  with no shielding does that tell you the change they have been incrementally
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.120]  testing soft kill weapons just designing everything to kill us cell phones GMO
[40:56.120 --> 41:05.360]  aspartame msg melamine mercury lead
[41:09.280 --> 41:14.440]  they have been doing all this testing what kills you slowly so you don't know
[41:14.440 --> 41:20.640]  what kills you 10 years down the road look folks this is just like the
[41:20.640 --> 41:27.200]  hearings in the 1950s with G Edgar Jagger Hoover in fact we could pull this
[41:27.200 --> 41:31.400]  up on YouTube I know I've seen the video Jagger Hoover try to search the
[41:31.400 --> 41:35.600]  term Jagger Hoover said mafia didn't exist Jagger Hoover testimony mafia
[41:35.600 --> 41:41.760]  doesn't exist I know there's audio of it in Congress I know I've seen the video
[41:41.760 --> 41:46.960]  and they said is there mafia is there organized crime and he got up he said
[41:46.960 --> 41:52.720]  no it doesn't exist it's a conspiracy theory ladies and gentlemen 55 56 years
[41:52.720 --> 41:59.240]  ago the American people were being fed on by different mafias Italian Jewish
[41:59.240 --> 42:07.640]  wasp Irish German all over the place even in Texas everywhere and the police
[42:07.640 --> 42:11.360]  wouldn't say it existed because they were all on the take for the whore houses
[42:11.360 --> 42:18.320]  and the drug houses and the gambling houses all of it and it's the same thing
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.040]  for decades the world government's been out in the open publishing thousands of
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.960]  reports every year to itself they think you're so stupid they issue these
[42:27.960 --> 42:31.520]  publicly and then have their pundits tell you there's no world government and
[42:31.520 --> 42:37.640]  no mega central banks that run it same deal just like they told you in the
[42:37.640 --> 42:43.400]  early 1950s that the mafia didn't exist on TV news and radio and print shut up
[42:43.400 --> 42:48.000]  it doesn't exist there is no or no such thing okay I mean is there organized
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.120]  crime do we know it now just like I'm telling you they're putting cancer
[42:52.120 --> 42:58.640]  viruses in your vaccines it's 100% on record everywhere it's 100% they're
[42:58.640 --> 43:03.440]  doing it on purpose it's 100% Bayer shipped out for the decade millions of
[43:03.440 --> 43:07.280]  ampoules of factor 8 knowing everyone that took it would get multiple forms of
[43:07.280 --> 43:14.800]  hepatitis and HIV they knew it they did it MSNBC is even reported on that you
[43:14.800 --> 43:18.640]  understand you're gonna feel very foolish later ladies and gentlemen yes
[43:18.640 --> 43:23.800]  there are FEMA camps it's the Emergency Centers Act the John Warner Defense
[43:23.800 --> 43:29.040]  Authorization Act it's in the Houston Chronicle about the FEMA camps the
[43:29.040 --> 43:35.080]  government funding of them the Rex 84 Miami Herald I have video the
[43:35.080 --> 43:40.760]  congressional hearings it's in my film police state to the takeover but just
[43:40.760 --> 43:46.120]  like J. Edgar Hoover Glenn Beck gets up there and tells you there's no such thing
[43:46.120 --> 43:49.720]  as FEMA camps just like J. Edgar Hoover told you there's no such thing as
[43:49.720 --> 43:56.800]  La Cosa Nostra of course there's such a thing as La Cosa Nostra there's a
[43:56.800 --> 44:06.240]  global La Cosa Nostra our thing it's their thing on us and I'm sick of it
[44:12.160 --> 44:15.760]  you know I've studied different mafias and if you go back a hundred years ago if
[44:15.760 --> 44:21.360]  any mafia got involved in whorehouses with underage kids the mafia would kill
[44:21.360 --> 44:25.120]  whoever did it not now they run it see how it's even the mafia has
[44:25.120 --> 44:30.520]  degenerated by the way the Italian mob by the 50s was having wars with the
[44:30.520 --> 44:34.320]  skull and bones mob the Jewish mob and others and they teamed up against them
[44:34.320 --> 44:37.920]  that's why when they had to admit there was a mafia in the 50s okay there is a
[44:37.920 --> 44:46.720]  mafia it's Italians it's Italians that's the only mafia oh it's Italians that's
[44:46.720 --> 44:53.640]  ridiculous ladies and gentlemen I know some of the best families biggest
[44:53.640 --> 44:56.440]  wealthiest families in Austin Texas went to high school with some of them
[44:56.440 --> 44:59.880]  they'd sit there and bring the school for a school report you know their
[44:59.880 --> 45:07.200]  grandpa at court hearings with Al Capone you subpoenaed up to Chicago
[45:07.200 --> 45:13.400]  about liquor running my dad's great uncle ran liquor in Houston for the Dixie
[45:13.400 --> 45:20.560]  mafia and Al Capone can you imagine this and by the way he was part of the
[45:20.560 --> 45:24.560]  real mafia the Masonic mafia two guys tried to rob him when he was going to
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.080]  speak easy's picking up the money he blasted him he went into court and did
[45:28.080 --> 45:31.920]  a Mason in distress and that judge went bam you're gone then they had a
[45:31.920 --> 45:35.760]  Masonic trial for him they'd have found him guilty they would have killed him but
[45:35.760 --> 45:41.920]  see oh there's no Masonic mafia it doesn't exist there's no La Cosa Nostra
[45:41.920 --> 45:46.000]  ten years ago they wrote news articles about Alex Jones saying I was crazy
[45:46.000 --> 45:53.840]  sculling bones didn't exist that here's newsweek today it's called conspiracy of
[45:53.840 --> 46:01.040]  dunces and it makes fun of me in here because I snuck into bohemian grove
[46:05.240 --> 46:09.160]  let me tell you what the real mafia does they go and have homosexual sex and
[46:09.160 --> 46:18.040]  worship Satan I've been there that's who runs this is it is is just every
[46:18.040 --> 46:24.720]  stripe of what has been seen as aberrant because that's the induction as
[46:24.720 --> 46:31.040]  Richard Nixon told Harper's magazine you've got to go be part of this to then
[46:31.040 --> 46:35.800]  be compromised and that's my next point I want to cover right now before I get
[46:35.800 --> 46:39.920]  into the huge news of the day CIA chief Leon Panetta believes Pakistan
[46:39.920 --> 46:44.320]  intelligence chief on major attack and they say they're fighting to stop
[46:44.320 --> 46:51.640]  imminent attacks right on time for the election so that is coming up but first
[46:51.640 --> 46:55.000]  I wanted to cover this because I keep saying I'm gonna cover it and I've
[46:55.000 --> 47:01.600]  mentioned it but I haven't the nation magazine bunch of other reports here as
[47:01.600 --> 47:06.720]  well mainstream news I remember day one eight years ago hearing that black
[47:06.720 --> 47:10.920]  water was running weapons that black water was running drugs from good
[47:10.920 --> 47:15.600]  sources that black water was involved in assassinations and illegal hit teams
[47:15.600 --> 47:20.680]  that black water was involved in just killing people for fun now that's in
[47:20.680 --> 47:26.960]  federal depositions and Eric Prince has run over to the Middle East to live and
[47:26.960 --> 47:31.920]  has moved his operations there just like Halliburton and the rest of them who've
[47:31.920 --> 47:36.440]  been Halliburton got caught running child kidnapping rings Chicago Tribune I
[47:36.440 --> 47:41.320]  mean you can't see they've got a leg up on us because the average person just
[47:41.320 --> 47:44.800]  can't admit this but I heard all this but never really covered it you know that
[47:44.800 --> 47:47.920]  black water was involved in the gun confiscations in Katrina we now know
[47:47.920 --> 47:54.720]  they were now they're known as XC all of that but we just sat back and watched
[47:54.720 --> 48:02.480]  others report it we said yeah they look dirty and if I had to look at look at
[48:02.480 --> 48:05.400]  somebody's a prime suspect of some of the biggest events in the last nine
[48:05.400 --> 48:14.400]  years I'd look at this group black waters black ops the nation and this
[48:14.400 --> 48:27.120]  report in fact this is the other one I I need the black the the the blackwater
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.680]  article about the depositions this is the one about them doing black ops from
[48:31.680 --> 48:40.640]  on Santo and Disney and Royal Caribbean cruise lines and others the one I need is
[48:40.640 --> 48:46.000]  the big one that I had on Sunday dealing with I'm gonna give you the exact
[48:46.000 --> 48:53.200]  headline then I'll just give you the exact headline hold on blackwater
[48:54.760 --> 49:01.800]  blackwater depositions blackwater cocaine just put blackwater cocaine the
[49:01.800 --> 49:08.240]  nation in and give me that please I want to read directly from the report but
[49:08.240 --> 49:15.720]  but the issue here is this is a fully auto ak-47s being smuggled in and out of
[49:15.720 --> 49:22.240]  Iraq piles of drugs parties with men all naked running around snorting giant
[49:22.240 --> 49:25.800]  piles of cocaine going outside and driving around at night shooting into
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.440]  Iraq he's homes for fun there it is US businessman blackwater paid me to buy

[49:36.040 --> 49:41.720]  see this now rampant why do I have army kill team leader one of the necklace of
[49:41.720 --> 49:49.320]  fingers wired magazine because when they get them into these army units and
[49:49.320 --> 49:53.520]  private merc units that's who they recruit they want them with whores and
[49:53.520 --> 49:57.000]  do any legal things remember the tens of billions of dollars shipped in in the
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.320]  first two years of the war on pallets and that it came out that officers were
[50:02.320 --> 50:05.760]  giving you know being given hundreds of thousands of dollars that's to corrupt
[50:05.760 --> 50:09.920]  them and then all the army and Marine Corps investigators who'd be sent to
[50:09.920 --> 50:17.520]  investigate and they'd commit suicide in their barracks this is just complete
[50:17.520 --> 50:26.720]  and total absolute lawlessness so that they're compromised and that's what
[50:26.720 --> 50:32.360]  Dinecore Halliburton blackwater all of these groups are given diplomatic
[50:32.360 --> 50:35.600]  international immunity their own aircraft like the CIA aircraft that
[50:35.600 --> 50:40.640]  crashed in Mexico with three plus tons of pure cocaine was a CIA torture flight

[55:07.000 --> 55:13.080]  the global mercs for hire for global corporations everything that's old is
[55:13.080 --> 55:17.960]  new what is new is old and then over and over again I'm gonna cover this start of
[55:17.960 --> 55:22.440]  the next hour then I'm gonna get into the economy but I will tell you this
[55:22.440 --> 55:28.440]  report by Paul Joseph Watson we had such a big response Christian science
[55:28.440 --> 55:34.040]  monitor yahoo news AOL news and close to 20 other major publications ran with
[55:34.040 --> 55:37.280]  the headline feds radiating Americans admitting mobile x-rays are driving
[55:37.280 --> 55:40.880]  around that became the number one Google search term yesterday because of you
[55:40.880 --> 55:47.240]  and it is causing a national debate to start that's the power of you the
[55:47.240 --> 55:52.640]  audience yes this shows the focal point so I'm gonna cover this all in detail
[55:52.640 --> 55:57.400]  later in the next hour but I do want to get started early today this is too
[55:57.400 --> 55:59.960]  powerful a tool we got to use it while we still have it before they try to
[55:59.960 --> 56:04.840]  change the matrix we're gonna make the search term today resentment toward
[56:04.840 --> 56:11.360]  government three words resentment toward government and this will hopefully
[56:11.360 --> 56:15.600]  cause another national debate to start about how they're listening to all of
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.400]  your phone calls violating the fourth amendment and publicly effect I want
[56:19.400 --> 56:22.960]  Watson to beef this article up as I want that point in there that they have the
[56:22.960 --> 56:27.360]  police now openly there in meetings saying this software listens to everybody
[56:27.360 --> 56:30.360]  and if somebody says they don't like the government then we put them under full
[56:30.360 --> 56:36.040]  surveillance that is that is quotes from the Buffalo News who was at the meeting
[56:36.040 --> 56:40.600]  they don't even hide this now they've been radiating your houses for a decade
[56:40.600 --> 56:45.440]  that we know that I learned of it five six years ago but now they just admit it
[56:45.440 --> 56:49.840]  fact I've seen cases of the CIA radiating people to death by parking a van
[56:49.840 --> 56:52.760]  outside their house in just a few hours they can kill you dead in a hammer while
[56:52.760 --> 56:56.440]  you're sleeping it'll take a few months for you to die but you're walking dead
[56:56.440 --> 57:00.000]  people need to know that they're being listened to they didn't know that this
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.080]  criminal government is completely violating the fourth amendment setting
[57:03.080 --> 57:06.240]  the precedent they need to read authorities plan to troll phone calls
[57:06.240 --> 57:10.800]  and emails for signs of resentment of government so the Google search term

[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.120]  never change who we are
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:29.280]  he was programmed from birth to be part of the most invincible army in
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:36.920]  history but like all scientific advancements they're practically
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.880]  manufactured using DNA profiles he was destined to become obsolete more
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:48.280]  endurance better hand-eye to hold it in standard what do we do with him? waste his
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:53.880]  disposal his training had prepared him for anything
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:05.520]  except this now on a remote planet a community of outcasts faces extermination
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.160]  I want that planet secured by 0600 what about opposition there will be a
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:15.880]  officially classifiable as hostels find weapons to prepare to fight you have to
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.760]  organize it for this soldier it may be too late to feel human how do you know

[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:43.800]  hero I'm going to kill them all
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:56.440]  soldier defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:04.280]  Jones yeah it was Kurt Russell soldier by the way you notice with the Israeli
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.960]  company spying on veterans and gun groups in Pennsylvania the Mayak Homeland
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.240]  Security Reports when you read this article by Paul Joseph Watson that has
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:17.240]  the quotes out of the Buffalo news they were at this giant meeting of law
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.720]  enforcement they said the main group they're watching are veterans they're
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:26.280]  listening to your phones reading your email if you show mild criticism or
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.080]  quote resentment towards the government you're put under full homeland security
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.600]  surveillance if you say you're depressed then that goes automatically to the
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.040]  computer database and then you can't buy a firearm if you're arguing with your
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.320]  wife see you're obsolete and the vaccines you've been pumped full of I know
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.560]  almost all of you have serious health problems you don't know why you exercise
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:52.520]  you eat healthy well but that's because on the psychological profile you weren't
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:57.120]  a psychopath you weren't a criminal so you get all the poison shots and most of
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.480]  their little devil dogs don't see this is very simple they you know they just
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.760]  like I tell the TSA workers will you run naked body scanners do you mind running
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.920]  them are you worried about radiation yeah I'm worried you're fired get out of
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:15.240]  here I got an idiot that'll do it you're obsolete they're done with you you
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.520]  understand that all you can do is join the Republic the only thing you can do
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.760]  is break through your conditioning and realize this country's already been
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.840]  taken over illegitimately and when we admit we've been taken over then we can
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:31.040]  set about taking the Republic back but until you admit that we're in this
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.840]  situation and grow up and do the research police who've been trained you're in a
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:44.240]  paramilitary war with the American people government agents FBI guys you know FBI
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.800]  people we've run into that gun shows the ones that have come to this office
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.200]  before they're on such incredible power trips they're always asking you
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.840]  questions looking at you like you're not human looking at you're like like
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:59.160]  you're stupid I'm a lot smarter than you are I'm not stupid you understand that I
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.760]  see right through you I assess you a hundred times more than you can assess
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:11.200]  me I assess history I assess anthropology sociology I assess you I got my
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.480]  head screwed on straight enough to know there's no making a deal with this new
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.440]  world order because I've read what they say they're doing and what they plan to
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:23.280]  do all I'm trying to do survive and that's the prime instinct that's the
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:30.240]  first intelligence you need and it's obviously something you don't have and
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.560]  so your bosses are making these announcements they have these meetings
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.680]  all over the country with the cops telling them they're listening to
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.640]  everybody including military so the cops get scared and shut up and go along
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.400]  with it they think you're cowards they think you're gonna be scared by all of
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.360]  this and go along with it when you probably will too it's what you want
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.920]  you want to fail you want to disgrace your family name you want to pump your
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.000]  kids full of sodium fluoride and mercury lay shots full of cancer viruses you
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:06.360]  like it you love it but don't say you weren't warned because that's why we're
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.040]  here we're here to separate the wheat from the chaff we're here to give people
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:20.160]  the choice we're here to tell people the way it is so they were told and that's
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.520]  why the globalists are attacking me on every front with every demonization
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:29.960]  tactic every lie every dirty trick and I don't care it means I'm doing my job
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.520]  they're scared to death you're gonna listen to what I have to say they're
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.520]  scared to death you're gonna check out the claims we're making they're scared
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.600]  to death you're gonna discover history they're scared to death you're gonna
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.800]  turn your survival instinct on and then that turns your intelligence on when you
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:57.040]  get in this mode you like being used up and flushed down the toilet that's what
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:04.560]  your bosses are doing I see your call Shannon Jim Tony Peter Adrian and
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.440]  others will get to you at the bottom of the hour let me start getting the news
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:17.240]  right now let me go ahead and go ahead and read to you from this report now
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.640]  of course you've seen all over the news the last two days they're all over the
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.240]  media saying terror attacks are imminent now remember a week ago they said we can
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.640]  absorb an attack and even get stronger we've tried to protect you but the
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.360]  terrorists are about to hit so they're even pre-programming everybody right
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.760]  now for when the attack comes that'll be the talking point well the government
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:43.800]  tried and we didn't give all our rights up so it's our fault CIA chief Leon
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:49.920]  Panetta briefs Pakistan intelligence chief on major attack US government is
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:56.720]  working furiously oh yeah to counter a plot to attack several European public
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.440]  targets CIA chief Leon Panetta told the head of Pakistan's intelligence
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:04.200]  community Wednesday now are they gonna stage an attack outright or they had
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.680]  their criminal groups fund lunatics who don't even knows funding them to stage
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:13.240]  the attacks the plot to attack multiple public targets and several European
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.120]  capitals was slated to occur in late November according to Panetta after
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.760]  capturing one of the prospective attackers in route from Pakistan's FAT a
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.960]  region the US government authorized the CIA to step up drone attacks inside
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.960]  Pakistan to unprecedented levels all working with various allied governments
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:35.760]  to kill or capture the two to three dozen militants reportedly preparing for
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.440]  the operation isn't it lucky that six months ago they put ship the thousand
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.040]  drones over there and right on time when the drones show up they're needed
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:46.600]  kind of like the naked body scanners were being delivered in December and so
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.520]  the attack with the underwear bomber happened in December and then it turned
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:54.720]  out he was brought on the plane without a passport or without a visa and could
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.160]  hardly talk and look drugged out of his brain and the government lied and said
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.520]  that wasn't true and it turned out it was true the undersecretary of the state
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.640]  department said an unnamed intelligence agency of the US government ordered them
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.200]  to get him on the plane oh here let the US government help you on the plane you
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.120]  little drughead you little zombie probably been in a torture cell for six
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.920]  months doesn't even know what his name is doesn't know who his mommy is oh look

[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.480]  body scanners I mean this stuff's so elementary this is a government that
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:31.560]  admits they put out fake bin Laden videos in the Washington Post to laugh at
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:36.720]  you they think you're so stupid they have Marine Corps kernels up on TV telling

[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:41.680]  London Robert Shapiro Clinton Obama advisor let me read a quote to you the
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.560]  bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.480]  leadership said Shapiro adding he has to find some way between now and November
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.680]  of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence in short of a
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:59.280]  9-11 event or Oklahoma City bombing I can't think of how he could do that oh
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:04.400]  give me a document cam on this what's this headline MSNBC Ridge says he was

[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:30.000]  staging these events and that's the main neocon message is anybody that says
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.160]  the government stages terror attacks or lets terrorist attack even though that's
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:42.000]  an admitted declassified fact is a terrorist oh President Obama please be safe

[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:57.600]  okay let's get into blackwater they were the best they were the brightest they
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.600]  were patriotic Americans who are based out of the Middle East now because of all
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:07.440]  their crimes are beginning to come out in court US businessman blackwater paid
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.480]  me to buy steroids and weapons on black market for its shooters a Texas
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:15.000]  businessman who has worked extensively in Iraq claims that blackwater paid him
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.920]  and these reports has constantly come out to purchase steroids and other drugs
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:23.800]  for its operatives in Baghdad as well as more than 100 AK-47s and massive amounts
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:28.400]  of ammunition on Baghdad's black market yeah because the reports are their
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:33.840]  staging events over there Howard Lowry who worked in Iraq from 0309 also claims
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.080]  he personally attended blackwater parties where company personnel had
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.200]  large amounts of cocaine and blocks of hashish it would run around naked at some
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.720]  of these parties Lowry alleges blackwater operatives would randomly fire
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.720]  automatic weapons from their balconies into buildings full of Iraqi civilians
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:53.920]  Lowry described the events as a frat party gone wild this is what the Iraqis
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.200]  always said they did where and we have all these other contractor and troop
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.040]  videos where they run over people's cars for fun shoot hole families and cars for
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:07.360]  fun and our national media never picks it up drug use was rampant Lowry says he
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.600]  was told by blackwater personnel that some of the men using steroids and
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.960]  purchased were on the security detail of L. Paul Bremer the original head of the
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:18.920]  coalition provisional authority Lowry also claims that blackwater owner Eric
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.240]  Prince tried to enlist his help to win contracts for blackwater with the Iraqi
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.240]  government using offshore security company Greystone which Prince owns the
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.800]  purpose Lowry says was to conceal Greystone's relationship to blackwater
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:35.040]  now they just call it XC. Lowry made his statements in a deposition September 10th
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.000]  as part of a whistleblower lawsuit brought by two former blackwater
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.520]  employees the suit was filed in 08 by former employees Brad and Malian Davis
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:47.240]  they alleged blackwater tried to build the US government for a prostitute for
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.520]  its men in Afghanistan and for strippers in New Orleans the aftermath of
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.560]  Hurricane Katrina the lawsuit claims that Prince personally benefited from
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.320]  alleged fraud the nation obtain Lowry's deposition for publicly available court
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.440]  filings this is just one low-level guy reporting that's just one little
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:06.560]  snapshot image of all of this
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.160]  blackwater Lowry alleges paid for steroids using company funds and
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.920]  purchases were coordinated their blackwaters Iraq country manager not
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.240]  only that purchased the pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals Lowry said in the
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.560]  deposition but I was also given money and asked to acquire syringes and other
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.560]  forms of modes of injection as well Lowry said the blackwater used him to
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.600]  purchase the drugs and other devices because unlike blackwater personnel he
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.920]  could move freely and discreetly around Baghdad Lowry says he personally
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.920]  witnessed several blackwater operatives injecting themselves with steroids
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:41.040]  Lowry said in the deposition that he was a close friend to Jerry Zovko one of the
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:44.640]  four blackwater men killed in the infamous ambush in Fallujah Iraq in
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:50.400]  March of 04 he says the man had provided him with tremendous insight in the
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.400]  company and confirmed that the use of steroids and human growth hormone to
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:59.440]  dust around and was pretty endemic to them and almost company-wide Lowry said
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.280]  that it was a why we can just look at a blackwater video on the news out there
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:07.920]  at their base I mean it's a bunch of Royd heads wide-ranging problem looks
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:13.960]  like a police department now the statistics are over 30% of cops were
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.960]  on Roy's including women and then now the police chief up in Fort Worth came out
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.480]  and publicly said they're taking him Bremmer well you need cops on Royd
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:30.160]  rage folks Bremmer was guarded by blackwater when he ran the CPA from 03
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:34.440]  to 04 Lowry said he would purchase the drugs for blackwater by the case adding
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.480]  it was a large quantity as I could get which was usually a case he said that
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.360]  the volume I was being asked to purchase on a daily basis was going up
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:45.280]  substantially as time went on Lowry also claims he purchased wide variety of
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:51.080]  weapons ammunition armor and it goes on AK-47s Lowry also describes instances of
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.320]  blackwater personnel firing randomly at Iraqi pedestrians and into buildings for
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:00.960]  no apparent reason oh they're on cocaine and steroids I mean that's a bad mix he
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:04.720]  details one night where several blackwater operatives read his hotel
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.840]  drinking till 5 a.m. when they left Lowry says they fired their weapons at
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.160]  randomly as they drove off Lowry describes parties that some blackwater
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:15.920]  personnel would throw at the Al Hamara hotel in Baghdad that he says were like
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.680]  a frat party with rampant drug use and see they encourage this so they can
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:26.720]  corrupt them so they got dirt on them one of these sweets was absolutely packed
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:30.360]  with gentlemen running around either with no clothes on or no shirt on it was
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:33.480]  like a frat parting on while drug use was rampant it was cocaine all over the
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.840]  table there were blocks of hash you could smell in the air walking up to the
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:41.940]  door he describes parties where you know one guy would snort an ounce of
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:46.320]  cocaine right in front of him just like Tony Montana level huge piles of cocaine
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:55.480]  weapons just total insanity we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones

[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:15.000]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.040]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.600]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.440]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:39.360]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:05.600]  important and was so successful yesterday we had an article about mobile x-ray
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.200]  vans with people driving through them bathing and radiation it's also very bad
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.680]  for the technicians running these we've had radiologists on to talk about this
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.120]  for some reason there's not even any regulations on it there is under federal
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.840]  law for all other x-ray systems but not with TSA and their viper teams now on
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.440]  the streets of America and we have the search term feds radiating Americans
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:32.120]  and look what happened right here Christian science monitor Christian
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:37.760]  science monitor mobile x-ray vans hit US streets and they literally lifted almost
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:44.320]  word-for-word they barely re-read it re-read it rewrote it and it admits it's
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.120]  real it's dangerous it's going on everywhere there's 500 of these at least
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.640]  and they're now setting up checkpoints with them gives us no credit I could
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.480]  care less I love it good give us no credit people are now having a national
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:59.360]  debate about this Christian science monitor huge here's another one yahoo
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.480]  news one of their top stories this morning feds radiating Americans again
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:09.640]  no credit word-for-word exactly our analysis amazing here's one that did give
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:14.320]  us credit AOL news feds radiating Americans with scanners at road check
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:19.320]  points is it true and they go on to say yes it's true and his most recent
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:23.240]  Google Trends coup Alex Jones encourage users to repeatedly search the phrase
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.320]  feds radiating Americans draw attention to prison planet reporter Paul Joseph
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:30.480]  Watson's new article in it the author claims that instead of dedicating their
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.000]  efforts to control illegal immigration and drug trafficking federal authorities
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.920]  are more worried about radiating American truck drivers and it good goes
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:41.080]  into all the dangerous stuff that's happening and admits it's all true now
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:45.960]  there is a new report out today that's just as out of control and horrible we
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:50.800]  reported on this of course a few weeks ago and and wired magazine reported that
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:55.320]  Google with the NSA and CIA quote can predict the future tracking everything
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:00.200]  you're doing but this police symposium will put that up on screen for folks that
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:08.840]  was in the Buffalo news three days ago they admit that veterans that seem
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:12.880]  unhappy in any way besides law enforcement applications the programs
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:16.040]  also designed to quote aid mental health professionals they're now spies to help
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.680]  war veterans become emotionally stable so they listen to their phones it I mean
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.600]  this is out in the open admitting you're being listed to your emails being read
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:27.880]  by the NSA given to local police and psychiatrists and then they just put
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:34.160]  you in the next database you can't buy guns and I can't tell you how many even
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.080]  famous people I've met famous football players that were Vietnam veterans you
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.320]  that you that say they can't buy guns now they never visit a psychiatrist no
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:46.080]  criminal record their phones are being listened to their band from owning guns
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:52.240]  no judge no jury no conviction so the real headline here should be veterans
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:57.320]  being spied on by NSA I mean this is so huge maybe Kurt Nemo can put that in
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.000]  his story he's writing about this I mean Watson's a great writer but and his
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.920]  stories get picked up a lot because he writes it dryly like a regular news
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:07.280]  report but puts the facts in there that nobody else will cover but I mean it's
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.880]  far worse than Watson even says in this article it's just oh by the way they're
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.280]  spying on the veterans and they just say it like it's no big deal in the in the
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:20.760]  Buffalo news the Buffalo news reports that the system works by detecting
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:24.080]  resentment in conversations their measurements in decibels and other voice
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:28.760]  biometrics also with again microphones on the streets more specifically the
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.160]  emotional spikes that characterize hatred and deep resentment towards
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.600]  government as a written transmission scrutinized by the computer program it
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.920]  can detect the same patterns of fixation of specified subjects states the
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:47.160]  reports and it says once an individual has been identified as harboring
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:50.280]  resentment towards the government from their street conversations phone
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:54.920]  conversations and emails the information can be passed along to authorities so
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:40:00.440]  surveillance can begin I remember 12 years ago I saw the federal grant was in
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.160]  the statesman that they put up microphones all over town and they
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.600]  said it was for gunshot detecting then I went to the company website they
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.760]  admitted oh listen to us listening to this man from 200 yards away it's a
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:18.560]  surveillance system now they've got laser pods of little low-intensity lasers you
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.360]  can't even see unless it's in the fog at night and they shoot them on your
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:26.720]  windows and it is able to pick up vibrations and get good audio of what's
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:32.920]  happening in your house so Austin's got license plate readers face scanners
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.560]  lasers most cops aren't told about this it's all part of the threat fusion
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.920]  center and voice recognition biometric trackers body scan trackers and it's
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.000]  it's nationwide and worldwide going in now and if you want to know where they're
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.480]  going five years ago Mexican Attorney General made hundreds of his employees
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:55.240]  taking plantable microchips to get in the building source on that MSNBC ABC news
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.840]  that people won't believe that I just pull up Mexican Attorney General makes
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.360]  employees take microchips and click on the ABC News link or the MSNBC or
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:09.360]  Newsweek thank you okay so just completely passed 1984 run by child
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.320]  kidnapping drug dealing murdering government that's poisoning your food
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:18.200]  and water so the search term today is resentment towards government how about
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:22.040]  when hundreds of thousands of listeners or millions of listeners make
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.560]  resentment towards government the number one search that'll cause a big stir
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:31.080]  let's not have 20 or so big mainstream articles about our report tomorrow let's
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:35.040]  have a hundred let's get this report by Paul Joseph Watson and the one Kurt's
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.880]  working on it'll be out the next two hours and let's get an email out to
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:42.720]  everybody enter the Google term resentment toward government resentment
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.840]  toward government resentment toward government three words resentment
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:52.360]  toward government and see how they like that well I'm really trying to make the

[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.200]  were saying give me liberty or give me death because death is what it meant to

[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:09.440]  the American people to wake up and realize what's happening in this
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:15.400]  country I mean go overwhelming is it too hard in the United States why hey just
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:20.040]  a year ago the Republicans were almost all pushing it now they've shut up and
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:24.280]  are claiming they're against it and they tried to ignore the Copenhagen summit
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.960]  they tried to ignore the climategate emails but I knew it was a death blow and
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:33.400]  I told people that I've never celebrated like that on air watching that
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:38.800]  capital ship blow up one of their main systems they are not invincible they are
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.880]  weak they are weak God bless you Shannon I appreciate your call and ladies and
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.800]  gentlemen it really is a spiritual decision now they can even tell you that
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:50.520]  with something like football that's why they have the raw raw you it's the
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:55.920]  spirit it's the attitude it's how you're going into this 110% you got to commit
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:00.320]  get past your fear and just say I am standing against you no matter what you
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:08.120]  do no matter what happens I am committed I am committed and you force all the
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.400]  sheeple who are on the sidelines are on them on the fence to make a choice
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:18.800]  everybody needs to decide right now right now what side they're on you can
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.600]  see this country's run by pure evil and it's a lot bigger than Obama that puppet
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:25.640]  reading off a teleprompter Jim and Oregon you're on the air
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:31.800]  I'm with you on that and I'm with your former caller there you know Glenn
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:36.480]  Beck is trying to get said that the admitted that the economy is collapsing
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:42.320]  by design yesterday I watched his show and he tried to equate anti-colonialism
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:48.000]  with socialism by pointing out Obama's history yeah he claimed I know he
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.120]  claimed Obama he claimed Obama because his dad was a communist and anti-colonialism
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:59.120]  hates America again as if Obama is doing it we've got the head of NASA
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:03.240]  climatologists saying destroy it we've got the Rockefeller Foundation
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:08.040]  deindustrialized the UN but it's all about Obama Obama and some mid-level
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:12.200]  communist professors he has this chessboard and he says they are the
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.120]  kings they are nothing but Aaron boys let's hear about Rockefeller Rothschild
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:23.000]  Bill Gates did you see him saying how Bill Gates was good yesterday on pinning
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  it on Obama as anti-colonialist if you just look at the colonialist and you
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.120]  know this and Obama is the colonialist he is the colonialist posing as a loving
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:39.800]  UN anti-colonialist so they can take over I'm sorry go ahead well that's right
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:45.280]  and those colonialists the thing is it's the people eat well I think he's doing
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:54.720]  that because we thought we fought that the the the colonialist 1776 exactly we
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.000]  there are a lot of people in America that are socialists that are against the
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.520]  empire they're against colonialism that is what quality because the empire is
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:08.920]  socialist the empire uses socialism to take control of governments the mega
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:15.640]  banks are the commies they are the ones it's not some little professor funded by
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:21.440]  the Ford and Rockefeller Foundation and tax money see McCarthy was useful when
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:27.880]  he was blaming clerks and and and janitors and and cleanup ladies but as
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.360]  soon as he figured out that the Pentagon was running at all that's when they
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:35.520]  flushed him down the toilet so see Beck is playing the part of McCarthy but
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.520]  McCarthy was for real in that McCarthy only thought it was low-level

[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:43.600]  these x-ray machines so that is coming up but I got I saw comments and some
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:46.760]  emails yesterday because I put a video out called the secrets of the new world
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:52.520]  order exposed and I explain in there how the global issues fascism communism in
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:55.840]  their own documents to centralize power they want to collectivize the general
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:59.480]  public's wealth but build an anti-communist movement at the same
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:07.080]  time to be a governor just like an engine so that they can guide it and then
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.560]  the globalist are above the law offshore with the new world government
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:14.120]  they're building set up by the banks and it's now all public exactly what we
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:17.600]  told you decades ago is what they built because we had their documents and I got
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.160]  emails saying Alex you're saying the government you know the Pentagon the
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:26.400]  military created the UN well yeah at a military base a Presidio 1945 it was the
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.240]  US idea the Rockefellers put the money up the Ford Foundation the Carnegie
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:34.400]  Endowment they put the money up for the UN Center in New York I mean people don't
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:38.400]  know that they just think I'm just saying that so it's always like we ought
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:43.000]  to get the UN out of America we ought to get out of the UN the robber barons
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.840]  created the UN to transfer our power to it and now they're transferring it
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:52.560]  directly to the banks the IMF and World Bank finishing up Jim in Oregon and
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:55.760]  Tony Peter Adrian and Brigham to get to you before Doug Rocky comes on Jim

[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:15.800]  the militarists who are the colonialists it's the Ron Paul supporters they know
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.800]  and they're colonizing us they it's they all it's all these companies running the
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:23.520]  scanners the data mining the face scanning the license plate scanners
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:27.240]  they're taking over here that's what globalism is they came in and control
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:31.760]  dollar laws to shut down our industry because they own the industry in China
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:35.480]  Bill Gates and others and Warren Buffer having meetings with the Communist
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.520]  leadership who are giving him money for eugenics I mean this is a total sellout
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:48.000]  the Rand Corporation wrote all this up 60 years ago this is their plan we got
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:55.880]  to stop it Alex I hear you Jim God bless you I mean we post the Rand
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:57:01.000]  Corporation the Ford Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation they run the
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.680]  military they run the State Department it's the robber barons it's modern
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:13.440]  slavery that's what globalism is colonialists give me a break
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:18.880]  Obama is a colonialist but see when when Beck and others attack him as an
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:22.120]  anti-colonialist that gives him cred in the third world this is a very
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:26.120]  sophisticated double game let's go ahead and talk to Tony and Michigan Tony
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:31.320]  you're on the air hi Alex hey buddy I want to talk a little bit about
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:37.280]  vaccines okay I know you had dr. ten penny on at another excellent doctor is
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:42.720]  dr. David IU but a y o u b I don't know if ever spoken to him but he did a
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:46.760]  pretty good presentation and he uh mentioned the Simpson wood CDC
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:52.320]  transcript and there's some uh some quotes from it like dr. Johnson on page
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:59.600]  198 this is a this is a meeting of the CDC and 2000 released by ABC News in 2002
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:03.040]  where they said we've brain damaged millions we've got to cover it up but
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:07.160]  don't give it to your children yeah and and what I'm reading the quotes go ahead
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:10.960]  and read the quotes this association leads me to favor a recommendation the
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:14.240]  infants up to two years old not be in immunized with tamera salt containing
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:18.280]  vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available I do not
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:21.840]  believe diagnosis justifies compensation in the vaccine program at this point I
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:25.040]  deal with causality it seems pretty clear that the data is not sufficient one
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:28.600]  way or the other my gut feeling it worries me enough forgive this personal
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:31.400]  comment but I got called out at 8 o'clock for an emergency call on my
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:35.200]  daughter-in-law delivered a baby son by c-section our first male in line in the

[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:26.600]  Alex Jones Tony is bringing up the head of the vaccine program at the CDC in a
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:31.760]  meeting in 2000 where they talked about millions of brain damaged people's from
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:36.560]  vaccines in the full minutes I remember the quote part of it correctly there's
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:39.920]  a whole bunch of other quotes and they talked about yeah don't give this to
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:43.640]  your kids I'm not gonna you know I'm gonna tell my daughter don't give it to
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:48.880]  our grandson that's the head of the CDC vaccine program and then Congress did a
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:53.920]  type of subpoena and got some of these documents from the CDC because a
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:57.480]  congressman had had his grandson brain damaged and so that's why that all came
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:02.000]  out but they know full well what they're doing and so I'd ask government
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:07.520]  people bureaucrats those that are part of this operation doctor Rima Labo has
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:11.200]  treated a major head of state in Europe I'll leave it at that and that major head
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:16.920]  of state you know told her yeah I know we're planning to kill everybody and I
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:20.560]  don't know if I want to go through with it but I have no choice they're soft
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:25.200]  killing us all right now and it's time for you to wake up to that folks but
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.960]  finishing up what you were saying Tony briefly you were reading quotes remind
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:32.760]  me the scientist on name I remember correctly was the head of that entire
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:37.680]  CDC program or was that the head of the CDC I'm going from memory that one was
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:42.640]  Dr. Johnson it's on page 198 of the Samson Wood transcript but what was his
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.880]  position wasn't he the head of the program I'm not sure he was the doctor
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.440]  that was attending well it was a whole bunch of them saying basically the same
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:53.880]  thing but go ahead yeah and uh another one Dr. Will said the number of dose
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.480]  related relations that are linear and statistically significant you can play
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:02.880]  with it all you want they are linear they are statistically significant and
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:08.120]  they all did that but Dr. David Ayub also talks about the aluminum in the
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.680]  vaccines it's not just the mercury because the mercury actually no it's an
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:16.960]  accelerant it's an adjuvant yes yeah and and aluminum attacks the part of the
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:20.440]  brain that the mercury leaves the loans and it increases the damage to the
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:25.040]  market more importantly it causes an autoimmune swelling in all cases it's
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.080]  just when you get a really big swelling maybe goes into convulsions yeah and it
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:32.560]  was a it was a Rockefeller scientist that found out that all aluminum
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:37.440]  adjuvants are taxing at taxons in the early 1900s and that's why they're
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:42.240]  spraying it in the weather modification program that they denied and now admit
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.040]  that they're doing God bless you good points Tony Peter in Washington you're
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:47.960]  on the air
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:52.640]  uh... i'm in a uh... agreement with you on just about everything i've just got
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:53.960]  one
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:56.680]  question and that is to whether or not the
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:58.960]  royal family of england are
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:01.400]  major players uh...
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:04.200]  with a few years ago tony blair
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.760]  so uh... i i saw on television uh...
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:12.680]  slapped the queen on the back she was surprised i don't think if
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:15.480]  she was his boss
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.520]  really that uh... he
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:21.280]  that would have been permitted and of course that's all age i mean did you see
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:23.800]  two years ago in the parliament didn't do what they wanted
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:26.720]  in canada and the queen's governor general neutralized it
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:27.760]  and overwrote it
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:29.920]  that happened in seventy eight in australia
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:32.640]  uh... they mean i mean they're always saying she doesn't have any money the
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.560]  woman owns part of bp
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:38.200]  and part of dutch roll shall i mean the diamond mines everything they're just
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.480]  that their wealth is a state secret
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:41.960]  it's just that it comes out that
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:44.720]  government money pays for all their palaces
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:48.160]  uh... and and it turns out they own some of the biggest
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:51.640]  p r firms that sell gossip on themselves
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:54.160]  one of the princess does it's it's all
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:57.360]  played that there this silly little vestigial
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:02.520]  ceremonial thing at the british laugh at that is a sophisticated scythe
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.600]  alright maybe you're right but what about uh... sitaro when he was in the
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:12.440]  london uh... he kind of snubbed the queen too are you saying that
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:15.960]  this uh... person that's all form
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:19.560]  would allow such a thing
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:24.000]  well obama of course is bound to many other royalty around the planet uh...
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.320]  and and and and groveled to them
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:29.240]  uh... in the media plays up uh...
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:31.600]  you know all of this uh... stuff
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:34.760]  constantly you know that there's no special relations between the u.s. and
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:35.560]  england
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:38.800]  from our research uh... the sax cobert gothers
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:41.920]  knows the house of wednesday are one of the most powerful families on earth
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:43.440]  along with their cousins
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:48.360]  uh... queen betricks and others in the netherlands serve
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:51.720]  but i mean regardless uh... definitely part of the power structure don't you
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:52.460]  agree
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:56.000]  peter well yeah yeah prince charles is guilty
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.560]  but i don't think he's uh...
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:01.080]  uh... great matthew gillian okay

[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:04.800]  solar power generator
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:08.320]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:09.120]  electric bill
[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:13.360]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:14.880]  company allows you to have
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:15.680]  it's true
[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:19.000]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.480]  technology is coming
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:24.080]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:28.240]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:32.560]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:36.080]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:40.160]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:41.000]  peace of mind
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.960]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:44.680]  science

[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:17.080]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcm radio
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:23.160]  network coming up at the end of this hour i'm going to get into china
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:27.760]  how the globalists admit they've positioned it to destroy the industry of
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:33.160]  the united states and why that's so important here cnbc u.s. is practically
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:37.920]  owned by china here's a roiders china's rich make generous gifts at gates and
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:43.160]  buffet dinner for eugenics so we'll get into the master plan in the last ten
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:49.240]  minutes or so of the broadcast today but for much of this hour and gold at
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:54.440]  thirteen hundred and sixteen dollars an ounce today amazing as the dollar
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:58.920]  continues to be devalued i wanted to get dr. dug rocky on i appreciate him
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:05.560]  coming on so quick because we've seen this precedent set where twenty years
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:10.080]  ago and even back to the fouries the pentagon said du is deadly poisonous and
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:14.680]  radioactive and should only be used of the soviet's poor cross an invasion of
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:18.040]  western europe because after nuclear wars already started you know it's going to
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:22.120]  kill the troops down the line but that's just what we're gonna have to do but
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:25.240]  starting in the gulf war they said we'll use it in limited areas and try to
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:30.040]  clean it up then it killed in main most of those that cleaned it up and now they
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:33.880]  just say use it at proving grounds use it everywhere we've had troops calling in
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:38.560]  confirming they don't even tell them the cases say wear gloves they don't tell
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:41.240]  you when they fired out of a gun it's now in hundreds of different types of
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:45.680]  munitions or a big gun that some of it you know gets on the troops they don't
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:49.520]  tell you when it hits a target it aerosolizes turns into particles then
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:54.720]  you breathe it and this just goes to the fact that now they're rolling out 500
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:10:00.160]  mobile x-ray vans and had checkpoints in Atlanta that we reported on that our
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:04.560]  report now the christian science monitor yahoo news aol news we're making this a
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:09.840]  national debate it shows that there's been a major change now they just don't
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:14.320]  care you know we're gonna let guys unshielded in vans fire we've had a
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:18.600]  radiologist and engineer radiologists who designed these systems you know it is
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:23.320]  and looked at the specs of these very units at least 10 times the radiation of
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:28.600]  the chest x-ray and it shoots through your walls and shows crisp images and
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:32.080]  shoots through cars they're just driving around doing this and they're not
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.960]  even wearing radiation badges they're not even top scientists are all over the
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:39.640]  news saying 20 to 50 times the radiation they'd previously said with the
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:45.200]  backscatter systems at the airports now going into mobile vans they force you
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:48.760]  through to get into sporting events there it's on the news you're gonna walk
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:52.840]  through them I mean that they want them in shopping malls the FBI says and then
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:56.840]  you pay for this with taxpayers this is a good deal not just nuclear submarines
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:01.760]  and Polaris missiles and aircraft carriers and drones now you get to pay
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:05.640]  the military industrial complex for this so I wanted to get dr. Doug Rocky who
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:10.600]  has a degree in different forms of radiation to talk about DU to talk
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:14.520]  about how they're just radiating everyone all over the place now and the
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:19.920]  mindset of not caring let me read to you his lengthy bio dr. Doug Rocky is a
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:23.680]  depleted uranium expert he earned his BS in physics at Western Illinois
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:27.520]  University followed by his MS and PhD in physics and technology education at the
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:30.920]  University of Illinois his military career span four decades to include
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:35.480]  combat duty during the Vietnam War in Gulf War one Doug served as a member of
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:40.560]  the third U.S. Army medical commands nuclear biological chemical NBC teaching
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:45.240]  medical response and special operations team third U.S. Army captured
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:48.400]  equipment project team and with the third U.S. Army depleted uranium
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:53.480]  assessment team during desert war one Operation Desert Storm and he wrote
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:59.120]  then in the official book on it on DU he literally wrote we got the guy who
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:03.560]  wrote the book wrote the book for you because now troops are calling me going
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:07.520]  they say there's no problem we can bomb an area and go right into it they say
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:12.200]  do you use no problem and they're just using it everywhere now he was the U.S.
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:16.920]  Army's depleted uranium project director from 94 to 95 the Army's director of the
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:21.160]  program he developed the congressionally mandated education training materials
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:26.120]  that aren't given anyone now and wrote the U.S. Army regulation 700-48 just
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:30.640]  like there's regulations on radiation on on on radiology equipment X-ray machines
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.160]  the government doesn't have to follow it and they call in TSA workers now we've
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:36.880]  confirmed this we've had callers tell us but I've confirmed it separately and
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:40.080]  are asking him do you have a problem with these are you worried about them you
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:44.040]  worry about radiation yeah I'm worried okay you're let go we'll find an idiot
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:52.080]  that'll do it he wrote the U.S. Army regulation 700-48 U.S. Army PAM 700-48
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:57.960]  U.S. Army's common task for DU incidents Doug has taught nuclear biological
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:01.160]  chemical warfare hazardous materials emergency medicine for 20 years and
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:04.760]  both civil and military personnel Dr. Doug Rocky was the original author of
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:09.560]  the 1982 EDRT emergency disaster response assistance team proposal which
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:13.720]  formed the formation of the today's National Guard CSD teams and the
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:17.320]  Illinois CERT teams in preparation for the 96 Atlanta Olympics he wrote and
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:20.040]  taught the original chemical biological counterterrorism course for the
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:24.800]  civilian emergency responders that is now the federal 120 cities and Department
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:27.520]  of Justice course that served as the emergency response team location at
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:33.720]  Birmingham, Alabama he joins us now and he's been affected in bad health and a
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:37.840]  lot of his team has died by the way just from the cleanup at the road of death
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:43.200]  in 1991 outside Kuwait they're on the Iraq border and he's still hanging on
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:47.440]  and are in a bull and Dr. Doug Rocky good to have you here with us sir well
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:51.520]  thank you very much sir you make me sound some kind of like hey I'm just a
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:55.240]  guy with blue jeans and tennis shoes yeah but I mean you are one of the leading
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:59.160]  experts on DU in the world you ran the Army program yeah and unfortunately that
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:02.480]  was part of my task in and you know when we when we use this during Desert
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:05.800]  Storm there were no preparations or anything put in place for medical care
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:09.840]  for environmental cleanup and all of a sudden General Schwartzkopf sent an
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:14.680]  order down to the third medical can't command commander DG Zula said hey by
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:18.480]  Doug Rocky you know the Pentagon said he's a guy to do it no haven't cleaned up
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:24.680]  the mess and do decon and set up the medical care and Lord Almighty it's now
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:30.560]  been what 20 years talk about what it's done to you personally and what happened
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:35.280]  to your team oh boy well I mean within 24 hours of the initial assignment we
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:38.900]  all started coming down with respiratory problems and rashes the first
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:42.080]  cancers on the team happened within six to nine months afterwards the first
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:45.560]  death on the team were within two years you'll see a lot of people in the
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:48.880]  Department of Defense they'll say no it didn't happen there's individuals out
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:52.280]  there today they try to stop all this information getting out they say it
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:55.280]  didn't happen we weren't there well we were there the photographs of video
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:00.500]  I'll prove it you know one of the things that was real interesting in 1998 Bill
[02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:04.920]  Clinton's a Secretary of Defense staff you know they all briefed him all right
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:08.880]  and they flat out told him you know eight years after the fact they had even
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:14.560]  notified anybody or set up medical care so it it's it goes on and on and on and
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:18.160]  on and you wrote the book on what it does but I mean tell us what what it did
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:22.360]  to you personally well but first half we got the rash and the respiratory stuff
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:25.480]  within two to three years as I'm going back on active duty for that's the
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:28.600]  director of the U.S. Army to put you right radium project to write the
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:32.240]  right train the regulations that up procedures the kidney problems are
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:36.520]  already there had probably 20 kidney surgeries that's what the truth that's
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:40.040]  what the troops keep telling me it messes up their kidneys and urinary
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.680]  tract how many surgeries you have sir about 20 20 okay please continue and
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:47.920]  then we had all the respiratory problems calcified granulomas of the lung
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:52.480]  the the radiation cataracts I've already had the eye surgery in the left eye and
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:55.080]  they're trying to postpone the eye surgery in the right eye because the
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:59.120]  surgery is just a nightmare and it takes months and months to recovery of
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:04.380]  recovery and it's so dangerous thing we've had happen and again I have more
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:09.360]  phone calls and emails on it again at the last 48 hours is because of the
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:13.920]  calcification of the phosphorization of the bones of the teeth you fracture
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:17.880]  bones all over the place and then your teeth just literally they disintegrate
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:22.640]  and fall out and my teeth are gone and then obviously you have all the other
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:25.600]  neurological problems the neural muscular problems and we're seeing it
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:30.200]  hundreds of thousands of U.S. military totally confirmed by the Department of
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:33.560]  Interpreters with all the same problems I mean it has just turned into a
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:38.720]  complete nightmare to members of my team developed cancer and died we had a
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:43.160]  friendly fire guy absolute friendly fire Desert Storm one in a Bradley fighting
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:48.520]  vehicle they're still to this day I got the message from him on the other day
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:55.040]  okay and he still was denied medical care after 20 years 20 years that he was
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:59.560]  in a Bradley fighting vehicle where an Abrams gunner shot it up with 120
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:03.200]  millimeter D around he still can't get medical care and then the widows of my
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:07.280]  guys that have died they've just all been abandoned them and now we just got
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:12.040]  numbers about the British Medical Journal and others 14 times the regular
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:16.160]  cancer rate in Fallujah three to four times in the troops that fought there I
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:20.120]  mean that is a nuclear war zone and and now they've gone from admitting to use
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:23.880]  badges just saying everybody have a party it's fun well you know that was
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:29.200]  part of the thing because what was really crazy at March of 1991 as I got
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:32.320]  this sign to do all the stuff I was given two memorandum and you've seen his
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:36.120]  memorandum before one was called the Los Alamos memorandum the other one was
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:39.400]  sent and that was written by Colonel Michael's team from Los Alamos New
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:43.720]  Mexico the major labs there and the other one was written by Colonel Greg
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:47.640]  Lyle from the defense nuclear agency that these are the number one bomb guys
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:52.520]  okay you don't get any higher they these are the experts and in the defense
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:55.840]  nuclear agency have warned about all the serious health hazards all the risks of
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:59.380]  political ramifications the fact that we would deliberately contaminate air
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:04.480]  water and soil leaving that contamination for eternity it can't be cleaned up but
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:09.080]  then in the Los Alamos memo was a direct order to lie on our reports the
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:13.880]  sustain the use of uranium emissions by maintaining active proponents and then
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:19.360]  in December of 1992 we started the US Army Environmental Policy Institute
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:22.840]  study on depleted uranium and that was co-located here at the University of
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:29.160]  Illinois in the US Army serial labs that's our main Army research lab and in
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:33.040]  that directive from December of 1992 said well do the study guys we know what
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:35.560]  the health has we can't clean it up there's nothing we can do about the
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:40.880]  medical or environmental effects but hey we're always gonna use it it's been
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:44.880]  going on that way ever since and now they've got proving grounds before it
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:49.600]  was what 10 now it's hundreds they're using it in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Texas,
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:54.240]  near small towns they're just in fact I've been talking to armors and others
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:57.880]  they now serve it out to the troops and don't even tell them it's DU well you
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:01.160]  know one of the most interesting things about that it's all over a week I can't
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:07.000]  decide it's a mess we've got up and around New York around the falls
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.480]  Niagara Falls that whole area is a mess we've got Puerto Rico is a mess we got
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:13.920]  England, Florida is a mess you know the contamination is definitely out there in
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:16.800]  the Gulf now what's been stirred up with all this current nightmare I don't know
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:21.960]  Hawaii has turned into a total mess and the Army simply refuses to clean up
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:26.040]  Hawaii even though they acknowledge it's there even though the medical effects
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:29.840]  are known they simply refuse to clean it up and then the Nuclear Regulatory
[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:33.880]  Commission just goes ahead and backs them up all the way you know I mean we
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:39.280]  have to understand we have to get rid of the byproduct of our of our nuclear
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:45.000]  energy system okay so 99% of everything that goes into the system at
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:50.600]  Paducah, Kentucky, Oak Ridge, and Fort Smith, Ohio to make reactor fuel or bomb
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:56.320]  stuff is pure waste that's your right impact of Florida 99% by massive pure
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:20:01.640]  waste well what we do then we turn it into concrete we turn it into deumiditions
[02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:05.520]  we turn it into pork look pork lift truck weights we turn it into cooking
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:09.640]  pots and even golf club heads I mean it's really neat and now now excuse me
[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:13.680]  I've read some of this but they're now putting this in regular products oh
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:18.320]  absolutely because of the incredibly high density I mean if you think about a
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:21.360]  golf club head what you want is incredible high density to get that ball
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:25.440]  and drive that ball long ways so they do that and then the forklift trucks you
[02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:29.160]  need incredibly high density to have a small volume but extremely high weight
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:33.880]  so it's used in the back and then for concrete it's called DU Crete you can
[02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:38.120]  buy it at the lumberyard and again what it does is strengthens it and reinforce
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:41.040]  the concrete you don't have to put the rebar in because it's already got a
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:46.360]  metal in it so so that's actually true this is sold at Home Depot probably
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:49.320]  different I'm not you know I've never gone into Home Depot to buy it but it's
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:53.040]  definitely sold on the market I mean you know you get it that's work with it so
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:56.720]  we have all of this stuff but then we continuously use these munitions because
[02:20:56.720 --> 02:21:00.280]  they're incredibly effective yeah but let's first talk about the half-life of
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:08.480]  DU billions and billions of years forget it I mean you know we have the
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:13.840]  rheological part of it okay and I mean we're looking at billions and billions
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:17.640]  of years really reduce even one half-life now when this stuff is laying
[02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:21.760]  outside on the ground I mean it's not a real hazard but once it gets in the body
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:26.080]  the alphabetic gamma mission literally tear up the body and rip up the body
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:30.440]  because they're in direct contact and now you have incredible radiological
[02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:34.240]  damage once it's inhaled and just absorbed or anything well by the way
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:38.760]  doc we did pull it up it's 4.5 billion years isn't that wonderful and this shows
[02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:43.400]  the mindset of these people they want a carbon tax on carbon dioxide that plants
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:47.840]  breathe but they're not worried about DU everywhere you know one of the crazy
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:51.640]  thing is in preparation for Desert Storm Colonel J. Edgar Wackyama who is the
[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:54.920]  director of the operational test of evaluation command for the whole
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:58.720]  Department of Defense okay he did a debriefing now he took a lot of
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:02.920]  information I wrote and he put into it and he totally confirmed all the health
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:07.000]  problems in it I mean when you pull up the actual briefing by him the Pentagon
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.360]  briefing thoroughly thoroughly acknowledges alpha particle taken inside
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:16.000]  the body has large doses of the hazard producing cell damage and cancer
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.440]  lung cancer is well documented well that's what happened to my gosh the beta
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:24.840]  particle hazardous the skin and the length of the eyes incredible rashes the
[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:27.960]  damage to the lens the other radiation cataracts again that's ripped my eyes
[02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:32.360]  apart we look at all the continuing problems all of the stuff target
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:35.760]  ordinance kidney in the bone and then when you got the bone obviously got the
[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:39.960]  teeth which just break out and the other crazy thing they totally acknowledge
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:43.960]  the state by the fact you're in sample containing uranium our mutagenica is
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:47.360]  determined by the Ames test well ladies and gentlemen don't pee on your
[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:52.920]  fingers because you're putting direct carcinogens on your fingers the culture
[02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:56.960]  is to him human stem cell bone line with you also transforms the cells become
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:00.800]  carcinogenic well that's why we have all the incredible levels of leukemia I
[02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:04.760]  mean we have incredible levels of leukemia in the returning military troops
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:10.200]  and totally as you just acknowledged all over Iraq Afghanistan all over the
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:14.040]  place where it's been tested up the Concord Massachusetts where we look at
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:19.680]  the Albany New York we look down at doc I want to get more into that but but what
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:23.760]  does this mean for you about the mindset of the war planners because you've
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:27.160]  quoted these from the late 1940s where they were already talking about this as
[02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:30.560]  a weapon because they had so much byproduct but they said no from the
[02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:35.760]  40s up until the 80s they said no you know they'd let the troops be an age in
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:39.240]  orange they let the troops take guinea pig vaccines they'd even have the
[02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:42.560]  project shad spray chemical and biologicals on the troops you know
[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:46.240]  treating them like guinea pigs but then there was this change it was just I mean
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:49.800]  that sounds like something Satan would do we'll we'll let the troops use a
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:52.680]  weapon we'll put it in concrete we'll put it in golf clubs we'll put it in
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:57.080]  forklifts we'll put it everywhere it's gonna soft kill everybody that gets in
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:03.360]  contact with it I mean something changed and that dovetails with now high
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:07.240]  powered x-rays that look through your walls and they're telling the
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:11.720]  technicians don't worry about radiation I mean this is madness
[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:15.360]  well it's not just that I mean you know we've got the Buck Rogers ray gun to the
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:19.560]  dear force secretary is authorized and told to use on civilians during any
[02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:23.720]  this any disturbances or protests or anything else so we've got this out
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:27.560]  there totally I think for me as a you know a career military officer a
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:31.000]  scientist a teacher and everything in medical you know I had to come to the
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:35.240]  realization especially when I was served as a director and did the stuff it
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:39.640]  wrote I came to the realization no matter what we did you couldn't clean it up
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:43.680]  after you used it no matter what you did there was absolutely no effective
[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:47.640]  medical care and treatment because as I'm doing this I'm deteriorating I mean
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:50.520]  one of the most astonishing things that they said at the U.S. Army Chemical
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:56.760]  School as they called me Dr. Rocker Dr. DU is my god how are you continue to do
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:00.600]  all this work when you're so sick and your guys are so sick and yet you guys
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:03.840]  are writing the regulations you're doing the research on the Nevada test site
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:07.520]  average improving grounds every place we were doing it and yet you're getting
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:12.320]  this done well I had a personally come to the realization my god what we have
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:15.560]  done to God's earth and what we are doing to God's earth and what we will do to
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:20.320]  God's earth is completely wrong we can't use these radioactive toxic conditions
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:24.560]  because we can't clean them up we don't have the medical care and yet the
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:29.320]  arrogance it said by the military mindset is any weapon that we have can
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:35.320]  kill and destroy man animal structures or anything we're going to use and DU
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:38.280]  weapons originally designed were supposed to be said as you said in the
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.040]  opening for armor you know the Soviets coming across the plains and what in
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:46.000]  Eastern Europe but the new weapons are far more effective against a
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.440]  conventional wooden-pane structure they're more convention effective against
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:54.880]  anything and so that's why we have all the different ones and so in Iraq nap
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:58.960]  gas that mean when you look at apartment houses and apartment buildings and
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:03.280]  houses and other hospital facilities and water treatment plants sewage
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:06.880]  treatment facilities that are all shot up and burned out with radioactive
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:13.000]  contamination you go my god why why why and we're seeing an exponential increase
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.200]  every year of the use of these weapons and the type of munitions they're in and
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:23.680]  the troops need to know you use DU weapons and you move into areas because
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:29.240]  unlike a lead round or a steel round and doc you can explain this DU has such a
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:34.600]  high mass that when it hits it you know goes through softer things but once it
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:40.420]  hits a hard surface it literally ignites a correct sir and let's let's get
[02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:44.480]  this clear the DU round is on fire the minute leaves the muscle of the weapon
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:49.320]  okay it's on fire immediately so it's shedding uranium rounds have an extremely
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:54.040]  high density but they're very soft so they shatter they break up a lot so we
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:58.640]  see 60 to 70% of it break up and massed extremely by the troops are
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:02.840]  literally firing toxic waste radiation guns I mean you talk about Buck Rogers
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:07.480]  Martians land and they're firing radiation blocks I mean literally just I
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:11.120]  mean Darth Vader stormtroopers wouldn't be that stupid I mean they're
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:15.440]  literally firing radiation guns that's correct and today when I did the work
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:18.520]  of the Nevada test site Berkeley Nevada that's what I learned that what I found
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:21.960]  out I mean we're out there shooting everything I was gonna shoot up four by
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:25.720]  four chunks of wood it was incredible I was shooting up sand dudes we're shooting
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:29.800]  up armor shooting up everything and what we learned and what we saw scared me
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:34.440]  it scared us and we had to do this to confirm and right as you said the Army
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:37.760]  regulations to govern how it's handled how it's cleaned up what you do but the
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:42.640]  medical requirements and then it was totally totally ignored and again it
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.120]  comes down to we have a mindset our nation now we're attacking and destroying
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:50.760]  nations all over we're killing and maiming and shooting everybody and they've
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:54.800]  never attacked us they've never done anything to us and then we contaminate
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:59.600]  the air-watered soil around them make their food unusable I mean in the
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:03.000]  comment our own stormtroopers I interrupted you I want you to continue
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  there but go back to you know you fire a 50 caliber rifle let's just pick that
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.880]  weapon right with a fifth with a DU round what happens well take for example we
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:16.880]  had the US Marine shot up you shot a 50 caliber DU round at the beginning of
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:20.520]  Iraqi freedom but they destroyed a neighbor's tank took everybody out
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:25.360]  inside of it destroyed the tank it was that simple destroy a neighbor's tank
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:30.040]  with a 50 caliber DU round and got every you know everybody inside no wounded
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.240]  ill sick you know I mean just a nightmare and it continues on what I hear
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:38.440]  day in and day out from people that are being deployed have come back they've
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:42.520]  gone into areas where DU has been used or they're using it they were not provided
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:45.240]  the train they were not given the medical care they're not given the
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:49.560]  procedures it's 40 hours a train they're giving the death sentence I mean it's a
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:53.320]  death sentence correct it is but it's a death sentence you know not only for our
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:57.800]  military and then you bring it on back to the families because the contamination
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:01.000]  has absolutely been brought back to the state and cross-contaminated within the
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:05.520]  military bases and off base I personally want to confirm that personally by doing
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:09.880]  it for the army you know and then you get the spouses that I've had spouses that
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:13.000]  have sat right here on my table right now I mean three people more I am right
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.560]  now they got cross-contaminated once contamination came back with the same
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:21.040]  medical problems that I have absolutely identical does it only takes a little bit
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:26.560]  the little bit I mean we're talking about nano nano amounts you know amounts
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:30.600]  so small that you can't even see it because in the park which when this
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:34.960]  stuff is used we're looking at extremely fine smaller less than a tenth of a
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:38.680]  micron so there's no filtering it'll clean it up or take care of her stay
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:40.800]  there doc we got to come back this is amazing

[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:25.760]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for

[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:40.440]  an hour just to take calls from victims of depleted uranium but this goes to the
[02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:44.480]  whole mindset of the system and I'm gonna beg listeners to do something we
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:49.280]  archive this live radio show and the live streaming video every day at
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:54.120]  prisonplanet.tv I want prisonplanet.tv members to get this
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:57.880]  interview with Dr. Doug Rocky and post it everywhere we'll put it on the Alex
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:02.480]  Jones channel as well but this you need to give this to everyone you know who
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:06.560]  is in high school where the military is literally taking it over and forcing
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:09.760]  recruiting and threatening kids to join you just send it to everybody you know
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:13.800]  in the military because the troops there aren't even labeling it they aren't
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:17.840]  even telling them they're just serving it out now they have a right to know the
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:22.360]  government doesn't own troops they're not allowed to kill them this way and pull
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:28.240]  up that headline for me came out about a month ago London independent it was the
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:33.000]  British Medical Journal and others and studies that have been done in Fallujah
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:39.400]  cancers and birth defects 14 times higher in Fallujah that's London Guardian
[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:43.780]  huge rise in birth defects in Fallujah Iraq former battle zone sees abnormal
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:48.600]  clusters of infant tumors and deformities yeah that's from a year ago this
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:54.160]  one's about a month ago it's a new major study 14 times cancers increase 14
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:59.440]  times in Fallujah that that should pull it up but but I mean they know this I
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:04.520]  mean this is crimes against humanity that are off the chart this is from the
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:09.640]  studies I've seen doc higher ratios than Hiroshima and Nakasaki why is DU so
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:14.240]  deadly well because of the incredible amount of quantities when we use 370
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:18.960]  tons of solid radioact materials during desert storm and then so we did that
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:23.840]  desert storm go for one that's just in a few weeks alright and then in 93 and
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:28.360]  94 we use another 35 tons of ball all right and I wrote the procedures for
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:33.560]  that we use it in Somalia and as we're getting ready for the Somalia we wrote
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:37.600]  and got out that October 1993 what's called that's the primary medical
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:42.840]  directive for providing medical care anybody exposed to DU and that required
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:46.560]  medical care being provided the radio bioassay done within 24 hours of
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:52.640]  exposure within 24 hours of exposure not weeks much years later because what we
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:56.160]  do know and when we wrote the medical procedures and all this other stuff is
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:02.080]  if you wait for 30 days after you're exposed to DU and do a radio bioassay
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:06.480]  that's your analysis what you will find with all the tests the tests the
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:11.880]  military uses either be in the army they use the same lab the same bad guys it
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:16.480]  only be one one thousandth what's actually in the body so that I mean so
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:20.600]  they deliberately delay the testing so that there is no medical evidence of it
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:24.560]  and then what's there they say well this is dietary well it's not dietary it's
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:29.520]  never been in the diet never going to be in the diet and so we have a total
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:33.600]  nightmare we have just a mindset of well this is an extra these are
[02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:38.760]  extraordinarily effective weapons against all known targets so we're going to use
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:41.920]  them we're not going to give the troops a train we're not going to give them the
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:47.360]  regulations that are in force and what's real interesting today the general
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:51.640]  that signed the army regulation that signed the original orders going back
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:56.600]  to 1993 and then in 2002 is now the secretary of the US Department of
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:01.160]  Veteran Affairs General E richard second my attempts to talk to him and his
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:04.240]  staff and get them to acknowledge and do what's required and we haven't even
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:09.480]  confirmed that they they need to comply with what he wrote he you know signed as
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:14.920]  a mandatory directive even though I wrote it meets with total failure all right
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:19.120]  I've got to apologize for some reason my mind failed me it's not 14 times an
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:24.080]  increase in cancers and birth defects it's 15 times London Guardian London
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:28.400]  Independent AP so it's 15 times sorry folks it's worse than I said toxic
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:32.240]  legacy of US assault and Fallujah worse than Hiroshima the shocking rates of
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:36.080]  infant mortality and cancer in Iraqi City rise raise new questions about battle
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:40.200]  no they know I mean the doctors are telling them it's the DU they knew this
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:45.880]  I mean this it's like Satan runs our government yeah because you have to
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:49.120]  understand what we're doing is about killing destroy and it sees the property
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:53.160]  terrain and resources and so anything that's effectively to do that you're
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:57.360]  going to do it and that's where I had to make the other one moral decision what
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:01.680]  do I have to do I tried within the system for years and years and years to get it
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:04.880]  done to get it taken care of because compliance with the regulation get the
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:10.160]  medical care and failed totally failed well I mean I'll tell you this America
[02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:15.480]  has got a lot of good people in it but we make jokes about Iraq and you know
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:19.840]  parking lot turn them into a parking lot glass parking lot and people are so
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:23.520]  disconnected from reality of course the banks have stolen 28 trillion according
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:27.480]  to Bloomberg of course they're setting up mobile x-ray vans that are gonna end up
[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:30.920]  killing the operators and the people they're hitting with them of course I
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:34.280]  mean it's the skies the limit doctor I mean if they get away with this and
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:37.400]  people make jokes about the dead and dying Iraqi children like the one on
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:41.400]  screen then I mean what's gonna happen to us the same thing I mean what does this
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:44.400]  say about what they think about the troops they don't care about the truth
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:48.120]  but that's most effective one thing that scared me and this all happened here in
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:52.440]  the last few weeks medical care for the Department of Veterans is completely
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:57.280]  broken we the Department of Veterans totally acknowledges from Desert Storm
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:02.280]  there's 300,000 media medical care they thoroughly acknowledge over a half a
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:05.600]  million from Vietnam with the new rules are gonna add another quarter of a
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:09.240]  million and they thoroughly totally knowledge of their own medical reports
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:13.960]  and you see those you have them where it's over 500,000 half a million from
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:19.080]  Iraqi freedom the current things alone okay and then back for a few you know
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:24.360]  just again here a couple weeks ago for September 11th all right the US Department
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:29.880]  of Veterans decides to sponsor a race car this September 11th Air National Guard
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:39.120]  race okay Air Guard 400 at Richmond Virginia $430,000 is what they pay to
[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:46.280]  sponsor a race car $430,000 sponsor a race car and my myself and my team and my
[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:50.400]  guys right here I mean just a handful of so we know we can't even get our
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:54.440]  prompted effective medical care for ourselves and we have to pay out of our
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:59.680]  pocket for our own surgery well let's go back they knew day one it was asbestos
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:03.760]  mercury everything several feet deep on the ground from the World Trade Center's
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:08.800]  collapse and they said don't wear respirators there's no problem core exit
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:13.160]  in the Gulf now they're saying it doesn't matter if the average age is 51 to die
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:17.680]  from the Exxon Valdez cleanup with the same stuff I mean it's this policy of
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:22.800]  they enjoy killing troops and first responders they they're setting the
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:28.040]  precedent and and the New York Post called the dead and dying medical people
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:32.040]  and police and firemen ambulance chasers for trying to get medical treatment
[02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:36.320]  for the asbestos I mean doctor I've got all the Rockefeller Foundation
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:39.520]  documents we've covered it where they said they want to reduce our population
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:43.040]  well you know let's come to let's come to the World Trade Center those police in
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:47.680]  fire that went in there and died that are sick today those are my friend they
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:51.880]  were my students one of my best friends led the entire rescue Willie Rodriguez
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:56.920]  that's reality and those guys call I got one of the one of the police officers
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:00.400]  senior command officials he's very sick and having all the same medical problems
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:04.240]  if we talk and he cries get medical care and we work at everything we can but
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:08.160]  they have just thrown those guys away because it's all the talking materials
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:12.200]  all the byproduct explosives all the byproducts of the uranium munitions
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:15.880]  that were used I mean I want to say that again uranium munitions reuse
[02:41:15.880 --> 02:41:20.120]  especially in South Howard and we know that happened you could see the on the
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:23.200]  video and the photographs and do the measurements well that's right I've
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:27.320]  actually seen major British reports where they did radiation readings they
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:32.640]  were off the charts and how was their 2,500 degrees a month and a half after
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:38.040]  from the from the thermal photographs of the site yeah I mean the whole thing's
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:41.120]  a nightmare so it's a medical nightmare all the way around well let me ask you
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:44.480]  this you're saying they blew it up using some type of DU weapon and there's a lot
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:48.560]  of evidence that shows that if tens of thousands of troops conservatively have
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:52.400]  died from DU exposure well if we're looking at the actual look when we go
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:56.960]  to the US Department of Veterans group this report that the Gulf War veterans
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:03.200]  information system reports all anybody has to do is go to www.va.gov then in the
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:09.400]  VA search engine you type in GWVIS that's Gulf War veterans information
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:14.080]  system but the acronym is GWVIS pull it up and read it it tells you point blank
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:17.600]  these are the number troops that participated we're on duty these are the
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:21.120]  numbers that are currently left alive these are the hundreds and hundreds of
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:24.880]  thousands that have now applied for permanent disability with the Department
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:28.760]  of Veterans Medical Prompt so but yet we've denied care to tens and tens of
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:32.800]  thousands and I've read that their life expectancy is way down so a lot how many
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:37.920]  people roughly have died from the DU God only knows I mean thousands and
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:42.040]  five thousands by thousands civilians of military I mean you know when we see
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:44.680]  all these military because you have to remember with the military you've got
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:48.840]  complex exposures not just have to you got the immunization you got the hazard
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:52.120]  materials you got all of the stuff that's gone in there and it's in the
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:55.280]  pesticides I understand but here's my question is we're almost out of time and
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:59.480]  will you come back soon to come back any day any time you ask me that maybe we
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:02.640]  should do two hours so I can really let you roll with your incredible knowledge
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:05.640]  and then take an hour of calls so when we let you go here in a moment we'll put
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:09.560]  you on hold doctor because of the shows about to end this hour and I'm gonna
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:12.400]  cover some financial news because so much is happening right now in the
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:16.840]  markets but but but this issue what I'm saying is this if they don't care about
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:20.840]  the troops dying from radiation exposure if they don't care about the TSA
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:25.120]  employees running these naked body scanners why wouldn't the Pentagon stage
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:29.240]  in 9-11 to kill 3,000 people to make trillions of dollars and no bid
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:34.600]  contracts and launch their war and set up a domestic police state a and b what
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:38.440]  is your view of 9-11 well the first thing you talk to the individuals were
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:42.200]  absolutely in there okay and when I talked to the people were there we know
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:46.040]  that the aircraft you know there was no aircraft to hit the Pentagon that you
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:49.080]  can confirm a video photograph that the people were there my friends were there
[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:52.560]  and you talk to the police the fire word at the World Trade Center get their
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:56.440]  direct opinion get them on the radio and talk to them find out exactly what
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:00.960]  happened by the people that were there and then a scarce of the G Saudi but the
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:03.960]  whole key thing would be when I want to have we got to leave this because I know
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:07.600]  you're running out of time every soldier every parent everybody has to pull up the
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:12.440]  US Army Regulations 700-48 they have to pull up the depleted uranium
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:16.040]  comet has trained they could have to pull up the pamphlets of the technical
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:20.040]  bulletin and read the information for themselves find out what's happening
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:24.920]  pull up the walkie on the depleted uranium briefing and I mean go to
[02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:29.880]  grassrootspeace.org and go to beyond trees and websites and you can pull them up
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:32.960]  and read them make sure you have it and then if you're the military has your
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:36.080]  commander why aren't you giving me the mandatory training why aren't you
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:41.160]  telling me this why aren't you giving me the mandatory medical care because they
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:47.240]  don't care well doc if your calendar is good we're gonna have you on for two
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:52.320]  hours we'll do an hour of overdrive one to three central on Monday October the
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:59.600]  11th how's that sound hey we can do that and just God bless you for your work and
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:03.720]  your strength and and all you've gone through in your courage I know a lot of
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:06.520]  military families a lot of people thinking about joining the military a
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:10.800]  lot of currently serving military are gonna watch this video hear this podcast
[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:15.240]  and look into what you're saying and they could search that army regs they
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:18.640]  can look at it for themselves because I have troops that email me and go they
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:23.560]  tell us do you use not even a problem and I have I've had military families who
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:27.520]  get mad at me people I know and have called me a liar to my face saying my
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:33.040]  son you know fires these munitions and you're a liar the government wouldn't
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:36.040]  do that and you just don't even know what to say to them doc I mean they're
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:39.400]  just so foolish well you know they're so foolish but then the problem has when
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:44.880]  they're in a crisis mode my phone rings 24 hours a day 365 days a year and I
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:48.200]  don't sleep at night or I get woke up or we have to respond or we have to get
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:51.200]  medical coordinator we have to get a pastor deployed or we have to get a
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:56.520]  police deployed I mean you can't keep doing it and I can't keep doing it
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:46:00.400]  because of the total disregard of our leaders for the health and safety of
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:05.160]  our military well people are just so gullible because if they admit the
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:09.720]  government knows deus kill on the troops and then they have to admit that we
[02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:15.600]  literally have nothing less than Satan running our country I mean if they have
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:21.880]  to admit that to themselves their whole fake world is over and and as you said
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:25.920]  on record the army knows this they know full well what they're doing and they
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:30.320]  just actually enjoy what's happening in the troops I mean it's not just they
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:35.120]  don't care you know and you get right to it what my pastor has said and my brigade
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:38.720]  chaplain for the military said to seven individuals people won't acknowledge it
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:41.520]  because the foundation of everything they believe that what they trusted to
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:45.800]  literally collapses and then their life goes and shatters well try to live in a
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:51.320]  365 days a year for 40 years I'm going back to my agent orange days and we
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:56.400]  realize what is happening and try to get it done for myself and I had to put
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:59.200]  this stuff together but get it done for these kids that don't know and they
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:02.800]  don't have access they don't know who to call they don't know how to get help
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:11.960]  dr. Rocky we'll see you on Monday the 11th of October so we'll see in about 12
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:16.600]  days or so God bless you sir thank you sir God bless you dr. Doug Rocky I mean
[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:23.840]  ladies and gentlemen the people running our country they always give the troops
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:29.480]  soft kill to knock you out to decommission you and you better grow up
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:33.440]  they're now trying to talk about police departments using du I mean it is just
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:37.920]  hell on earth face the facts learn the truth this du issue could open up
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:42.240]  reality to so many people because it's a hundred percent admitted now I wanted to
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:49.000]  get us some financial news because us is practically owned by China CNBC China's
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:53.280]  rich make generous gifts at gates and buffet dinner I must spend more time on
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:58.320]  this tomorrow but I'm going to cover it now it is so huge to understand what
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:03.000]  they've done how the globalist set up China as the model and this transfer of
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:08.280]  power to China and the fact that China is donating money for eugenics to
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:12.800]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation they have the one-child policy in place we
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:20.120]  also have gold hitting $1316 an ounce today we've got CNBC reporting gold
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:25.200]  could hit 2,000 a mid inflation you've got the dollar plunging it at a record
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:29.880]  rate we've got the economic numbers that America is completely disappearing the
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:34.120]  middle class is is disappearing it's melting like an ice cream cone in the
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:38.400]  middle of July a land on the sidewalk I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up
[02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:43.880]  Ted I haven't been watching it since I saw it at 1316 where is gold and what
[02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:51.320]  high did it touch today 1316 90 currently gold is at 1308 80 or 1308 30 so we're
[02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:57.600]  here $22 and 10 cents currently trading at 2178 it's been a hot market hot
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:02.800]  market it's just amazing you know it it continues to climb and it's just gaining
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:06.920]  momentum which is not surprising this time of the year we're sort of entering
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:10.320]  into that time frame where gold does come around and it does very well the
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:13.240]  Federal Reserve's announced it's going to start printing money and giving it to
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:16.960]  itself not even to us it's bad enough to print it then it devalues we should get
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:19.840]  something out of it we're not even getting the benefits of the Weimar
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:23.320]  Republic and they just keep it but then devalue the money we've got and then we
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:28.200]  have to pay it in taxes I haven't asked you today if you still got the silver
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:32.320]  half dollars at 1050 that nobody else in this world that I've seen can touch and
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:36.640]  the different super gold specials you've got just for radio listeners Ted what
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:42.120]  are they yeah I do I have the silver half price is right now at $10 and 50
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:46.240]  cents just like you said however the internet price now is at $1,212 and
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:51.600]  28 cents by the way US Eagles just jumped over $1,400 an ounce there at
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:58.120]  1401 British sovereigns they're at 360 I'm carrying that deal at 355 the
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:03.160]  Frank's remember we talked about those I got them at 283 62 they're currently at
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:10.240]  288 so the margins are the markets moving up with gold and everything's going
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:14.200]  just you know gangbusters and how long until you run out of the gold you bought
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:17.240]  a few weeks ago and then it's gonna have to go up because you're selling this is
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:21.100]  like a time machine folks can go back in time and buy gold when it was lower how
[02:50:21.100 --> 02:50:25.680]  long can you keep offering that well you know I'm I'm watching my supply and I
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:29.080]  know that prices are gonna go up and it just it's just inevitable it's a matter
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:33.080]  of time probably the next thing that's gonna take the big increases those
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:39.280]  walking liberty hives at 1050 let me give the number out 800 686 2237

[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.680]  people believe so gold is better investment in the dollar despite it
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:17.880]  hitting a new record said Tom Winfreyt CEO of financial services of
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:23.160]  Rivington Street Holdings CNBC reported Monday gold hit a new record high and it
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:27.480]  goes on he says America is practically owned by China he reminded them at the
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:31.440]  1900s Sterling was the world's reserve currency in 1948 that was no longer the
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:36.000]  case the British Empire collapsed America is doing what Britain did and he went
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.400]  on to say we're gonna collapse that's what all the other big analysts are
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:41.800]  saying this was done by design the globalists knew when they sold derivatives
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:45.640]  they knew when they ran up America's credit card to build their world
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:52.200]  government and move their operations to China that this was going to happen and
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:55.480]  they're just gonna destroy the country they're gonna raise the taxes to fund the
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:56:00.040]  world government and we're over we're done unless we reverse this but at least
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:04.560]  individuals can protect themselves with gold and silver and we're trying to move

[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:58.640]  population reduction look at how China is the model China's elite totally bought
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:03.280]  into this China's elite killed 80 plus million of their own people they love
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:07.720]  it they live bunch of killers and our media doesn't tell us China's corrupt
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:10.920]  anymore even though they're just as corrupt as ever they're the new model
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:14.960]  you want to know what America's gonna look like China it's a lot bigger than
[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:20.360]  that devil Barack Obama it's transpartisan what's that term continuity of
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:24.360]  agenda look at that worldwide continuity of agenda with this new world order no
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:27.640]  matter who gets an office continuity of agenda we're in deep trouble Ted in
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:31.680]  closing what's your take on the media openly saying we're done and all this
[02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:36.000]  this is him this is amazing well the right on target and the reason why they
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:40.080]  are is because of the fact that China has been financing our prosperity from
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:47.360]  about 1980 all the way up through the year 2006 and they had taken on about
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:52.720]  3.3 trillion dollars worth of US government bonds that helped it helped
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:56.080]  us so we didn't have to turn on the printing press here China does well
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:59.720]  that's how it was sold the globalists were getting us in that position to be
[02:57:59.720 --> 02:58:03.800]  under Chinese control that's exactly right well we can't even you know we
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:07.160]  can't even raise our arms against China they can put embargoes against our
[02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:10.400]  products but we can't put them against yeah they just put them on chicken
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:14.400]  they're putting embargoes on us trade things on us but that's what they're
[02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:18.080]  does that's why the government gave tax incentives to move to China that's what
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:22.320]  they admit post-industrial America they're gonna destroy you financially so you've
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:26.760]  got to serve them get into golden silver now folks they're nothing's perfect but
