[00:11.920 --> 00:19.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.440 --> 00:35.640]  Alex Jones we are locked in loaded ladies and gentlemen blasting out
[00:35.640 --> 00:44.480]  worldwide thank you so much for joining us it is the sixth day of February 2012
[00:44.480 --> 00:50.840]  and we're going to be here for the next three hours now I'll tell you about the
[00:50.840 --> 00:54.600]  guests we've got coming up and you can see that their details posted in full
[00:54.600 --> 00:59.240]  wars.com in the radio show section they're on the front page I'll tell
[00:59.240 --> 01:04.400]  you about the guest coming up when we start the second segment but just so
[01:04.400 --> 01:09.320]  much incredible news that we've got to cover today there's a big announcement
[01:09.320 --> 01:12.600]  by the frontrunner and the Mexican elections that they are basically going
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.440]  to open the door for a full-on US military invasion that's all part of the
[01:17.440 --> 01:22.880]  merger of the countries under the North American Union there's also a hysterical
[01:22.880 --> 01:31.280]  article in the fading New York Times activists fight green projects seeing UN
[01:31.280 --> 01:38.520]  plot and then they go on to admit it's a UN plot but engage in this weird double
[01:38.520 --> 01:42.480]  think I constantly see where well yes there's a world government being a
[01:42.480 --> 01:46.040]  established in fact guys will you pull me out of yesterday's stack the desert
[01:46.040 --> 01:50.240]  news and the prison planet article that we wrote about it where UN calls for
[01:50.240 --> 01:57.120]  global tax so there they say crazy people say there's a plan for a global
[01:57.120 --> 02:02.320]  government the global tax we want the global tax but it doesn't exist if you
[02:02.320 --> 02:07.840]  don't like it and with yuppies and people they're able to keep these two
[02:07.840 --> 02:12.720]  opposing ideas in their heads at the same time and the New York Times is
[02:12.720 --> 02:19.160]  freaking out that all over the country their sustainability councils their
[02:19.160 --> 02:24.120]  smart growth is being shot down one of the few places it's not is places like
[02:24.120 --> 02:28.360]  the whole state of California with 20 plus percent now a year carbon taxes
[02:28.360 --> 02:32.880]  shutting down when industries left and here in Austin they announced a couple
[02:32.880 --> 02:36.640]  years ago they said we're going to jack up your power prices double them in the
[02:36.640 --> 02:40.480]  next three years and they have increased them quite a bit last year they've
[02:40.480 --> 02:45.360]  announced 80% increases in the next year for most power consumers but some are
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.800]  only have a 40% increase and they said it's for the earth big mega foreign
[02:49.800 --> 02:53.160]  corporations that have moved in and taken over the power plants and shut down
[02:53.160 --> 02:57.960]  their competition they're getting the money but they actually say you having
[02:57.960 --> 03:02.280]  less money is good and if you go to Whole Foods here in Austin where I live
[03:02.280 --> 03:06.120]  half the magazines we went and shot video this about a year ago I'm gonna send
[03:06.120 --> 03:11.040]  reporters back over there this week to get some footage of it it's just it's
[03:11.040 --> 03:18.000]  austerity magazine and being poor is cool and it's all about pay more literally
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.840]  for the earth be poor so patches in your clothes it's good they're shutting down
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.640]  the economy it's for the earth in fact you can type in headlines like
[03:27.640 --> 03:33.160]  recession good to lower carbon footprint in fact print me that because I
[03:33.160 --> 03:37.480]  hadn't seen this till I got here about 40 minutes before showtime as I really
[03:37.480 --> 03:42.520]  get ready at home and I hadn't seen this article and so this is my problem it's
[03:42.520 --> 03:47.840]  why I digress down rabbit trails which is good I see this article and my mind
[03:47.840 --> 03:53.680]  explodes with thoughts thousands of articles UN documents public statements
[03:53.680 --> 03:58.600]  post-industrial world how they're going to do it and then they write an article
[03:58.600 --> 04:04.640]  making fun of people that are aware of it but then go on to admit that they are
[04:04.640 --> 04:11.080]  doing just what we say it's just it's not a conspiracy it's a loving UN plan to
[04:11.080 --> 04:15.560]  shut down our resources and give China three coal power plants a week and we
[04:15.560 --> 04:22.040]  don't get three new ones a year and of course last year the new the the White
[04:22.040 --> 04:25.880]  House responded to an info wars comm article showing that we were having
[04:25.880 --> 04:29.720]  blackouts everywhere because of shutting down power plants we had power
[04:29.720 --> 04:33.440]  commission reports and the White House came out and said we were crazy it
[04:33.440 --> 04:37.240]  didn't exist but then a month later the head of the energy department came out
[04:37.240 --> 04:41.400]  and said oh we're gonna shut down quote massive numbers of power plants and it's
[04:41.400 --> 04:46.520]  for the earth so we're gonna make you all poor it's for the earth no you're a
[04:46.520 --> 04:51.280]  bunch of monopoly men shutting down our economies and people are aware of you
[04:51.280 --> 04:54.760]  criminals that's why the New York Times is going bankrupt it's why everybody
[04:54.760 --> 05:01.200]  hates your stinkin traitorous slime bag trashy guts this is Alex Jones with
[05:01.200 --> 05:04.960]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[05:04.960 --> 05:08.720]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[05:08.720 --> 05:13.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[05:13.240 --> 05:16.840]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[05:16.840 --> 05:21.160]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[05:21.160 --> 05:25.480]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[05:25.480 --> 05:29.240]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.240 --> 05:33.360]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.360 --> 05:37.320]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.160]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.160 --> 05:43.880]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[08:27.120 --> 08:32.240]  transmission against tyranny today I will tell you about the guests that are

[08:38.640 --> 08:45.120]  phones during this hour some and in the second and the third but let me just now
[08:45.120 --> 08:50.560]  go over some of the news there's a big stack obviously with Israel the United
[08:50.560 --> 08:55.560]  States in NATO and more with the Defense Secretary saying yeah looks like war is
[08:55.560 --> 08:59.520]  on in April May or June now that doesn't mean it's going to happen but the troops
[08:59.520 --> 09:04.160]  are massing 100,000 US troops in and around and I've talked about military
[09:04.160 --> 09:08.200]  sources they're being told it's going to happen now sometimes they tell the troops
[09:08.200 --> 09:11.800]  that because they're intending to but there's a window to stop it let's be
[09:11.800 --> 09:16.480]  clear we've backed off the Iran war repeatedly before but the Brookings
[09:16.480 --> 09:19.600]  Institute and a bunch of others ran corporation I talked about this on the
[09:19.600 --> 09:25.360]  Sunday radio show are openly saying a provocation would sure help and they
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.160]  openly talk about Gulf of Tonkin slash Pearl Harbor type events shades of the
[09:30.160 --> 09:36.120]  PNAC reports put out by Cheney September 20th 2000 and there's a good
[09:36.120 --> 09:42.240]  headline from Empire Burlesque from Chris Floyd runaway train stopped the war
[09:42.240 --> 09:49.480]  against Iran now Iran mass producing anti-ship cruise missile AFP's reporting
[09:49.480 --> 09:54.560]  Iran warships dock at Saudi port Russia condemns West hypocritical reaction to
[09:54.560 --> 10:01.160]  Syria invasion veto basically the West is using classic al Qaeda forces same
[10:01.160 --> 10:05.480]  folks they used in Libya have now been rotated in and are invading through
[10:05.480 --> 10:08.960]  three different areas into Syria these are proxy wars to overthrow these
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.400]  countries I'm no fan of Assad I'm no fan of the moolas the point is the globalist
[10:13.400 --> 10:19.440]  are trying to put stuff even worse in they're just creating total chaos we've
[10:19.440 --> 10:24.440]  got all of that coming up Greece takes a step closer to default they were put
[10:24.440 --> 10:29.320]  into receivership to now go into default part of the IMF World Bank plan big
[10:29.320 --> 10:33.800]  news out of the Washington Times Mexican vote may determine future of drug war
[10:33.800 --> 10:38.360]  and buried in the article they have the big pre-national candidate the party
[10:38.360 --> 10:41.480]  that was in power for a hundred years that's about to get back into power the
[10:41.480 --> 10:46.600]  polls show the pre is saying what we already knew what Perry talked about
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.800]  Rick Perry while running let's invade Mexico well they're saying we won't just
[10:50.800 --> 10:57.040]  have drones and advisors they want the Marines down there from the halls of
[10:57.040 --> 11:01.760]  Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli we will fight the mega banks battles and
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.680]  bring in the hundred billion every few months in drug money I'm now butchering
[11:06.680 --> 11:15.480]  from the halls of my to the shores of Tripoli and it is certainly on so
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.720]  there's quotes out of the Mexican news in the Washington Times on this it's a
[11:19.720 --> 11:24.680]  big deal part of the North American Union plan where they said in 2006 in
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.280]  Banff Canada they would use the deteriorating security crisis to merge
[11:29.280 --> 11:34.400]  the three militaries and you've seen those public deals where US generals you
[11:34.400 --> 11:39.480]  know Mexican troops to fight terrorists inside US and vice versa or US troops
[11:39.480 --> 11:45.200]  help it Olympic games in Canada remember two years ago they're just
[11:45.200 --> 11:50.600]  acclimating everyone oh Mexican and Dutch troops in New Orleans helping with
[11:50.600 --> 11:55.760]  the flood Washington Post all part of the conditioning and we have the
[11:55.760 --> 11:59.840]  globalist documents admitting that obviously I'm gonna get to this now but
[11:59.840 --> 12:05.800]  later I didn't watch the Super Bowl but I happen to have a business meeting last
[12:05.800 --> 12:11.120]  night with some of the crew on this film we're finishing up it's a little 30
[12:11.120 --> 12:14.280]  minute but it's gonna be very powerful sometimes shorter films are even more
[12:14.280 --> 12:17.840]  powerful than two hour three-hour films dealing with the globalist and how to
[12:17.840 --> 12:24.600]  defeat them and their and and and the keys you know to their mindset so I took
[12:24.600 --> 12:29.040]  them out to a restaurant and I see a guy complaining getting mad saying turn
[12:29.040 --> 12:34.200]  up the football and they said sir 500 places have the audio on we don't do
[12:34.200 --> 12:38.600]  that here and the guy's like buddy it's and he's with his wife he's like but
[12:38.600 --> 12:42.920]  it's Madonna huh and he said it like it was a joke but he was serious and she
[12:42.920 --> 12:48.120]  was like squatting on a throne with big horns you know in the goddess outfit and
[12:48.120 --> 12:53.040]  slaves dragging her around and just total Illuminati big all-seeing eyes and
[12:53.040 --> 12:57.560]  it's like what a cheesy religion the globalist follow what a bunch of
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.520]  pathetic scum nothing against old people will all be there one day but
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.200]  there's something about this geriatric looking woman I guess she's put her
[13:06.200 --> 13:12.680]  body through so much at only 51 prancing around squatting on a gold throne we're
[13:12.680 --> 13:17.240]  gonna be talking more about that coming up a little bit later but there's some
[13:17.240 --> 13:24.920]  video of her being hauled in you know on the throne by her slaves I guess us the
[13:24.920 --> 13:34.400]  American people now again we have this top story at info wars dot com red
[13:34.400 --> 13:40.080]  linked Ron Paul warns of Federal Reserve power grab this is big news his
[13:40.080 --> 13:44.920]  his weekly update has not been put into text form yet it's got no coverage he
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.720]  put it out this morning and he analyzes you're worried about recess
[13:50.720 --> 13:54.040]  appointments where they don't even take the person to Congress now so it's not
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.080]  a recess appointment they just appoint them the executive does outside of
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.840]  congressional approval which is another major step towards dictatorship
[14:03.840 --> 14:08.520]  launching wars without Congress saying you'll kill US citizens without trials
[14:08.520 --> 14:13.840]  without Congress all of this is what the bureaucracy the National Security
[14:13.840 --> 14:18.480]  Council run by globalist wants is for Congress to be purely ceremonial and
[14:18.480 --> 14:22.000]  Congress is so happy with the insider trading and corruption on average they're
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.720]  happy to do it but Ron Paul points out and and Kurt Nemo did more research and
[14:26.720 --> 14:32.200]  links to the documents that this is a total Federal Reserve international
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.920]  power grab over all financial transactions over basically all
[14:36.920 --> 14:43.080]  businesses over all credit unions and banks member last year and then two
[14:43.080 --> 14:46.280]  years before that the Texas banking Association president wrote big
[14:46.280 --> 14:51.920]  articles warning that this whole financial regulation is allowing more
[14:51.920 --> 14:56.160]  derivatives more scams by the big six offshore banks that control the private
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.960]  fellow reserves a holding company and that it allows them to shut down their
[15:00.960 --> 15:07.280]  competition well that's what's going on right now just like in Europe the very
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.320]  same megabanks same six banks and their European subsidiaries are getting total
[15:12.320 --> 15:16.240]  dictatorial power over all the countries of Europe through the government
[15:16.240 --> 15:22.120]  agencies criminally signing over total control and saying you have no sovereignty
[15:22.120 --> 15:27.240]  foreign banks will control you now we're hearing in Rhode Island in Michigan
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.800]  other areas where whole cities are being told since your bankrupt no more city
[15:31.800 --> 15:37.160]  council a private corporation runs you now and can do whatever they want triple
[15:37.160 --> 15:42.600]  the water triple the power put tolls on existing roads and then never build up
[15:42.600 --> 15:46.760]  the infrastructure just take the money out because you went into debt and so
[15:46.760 --> 15:53.320]  now the city manager treacherously signs contracts and signs you over to the big
[15:53.320 --> 15:57.520]  consortiums that manipulated you into fraudulent debt to begin with instead of
[15:57.520 --> 16:03.520]  going to jail the Kinley Bernie Madoff types take over and coming up later we're
[16:03.520 --> 16:06.800]  going to play that Texas straight talk it's only a few minutes long but again
[16:06.800 --> 16:10.560]  if you want to watch it it's up at info wars.com Ron Paul warns the fellow
[16:10.560 --> 16:14.600]  reserve power grab please get this article out to everybody it's red linked
[16:14.600 --> 16:21.800]  not only was Obama's appointment of Richard Cordray to the misnamed consumer
[16:21.800 --> 16:25.640]  financial protection bureau unconstitutional but the newly minted
[16:25.640 --> 16:29.760]  federal of viathan itself is in direct violation of the Constitution
[16:29.760 --> 16:36.040]  specifically the 10th Amendment. In January Obama thumbed his nose at article
[16:36.040 --> 16:39.560]  two section to the Constitution it states that the president shall nominate
[16:39.560 --> 16:45.880]  and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint officers to
[16:45.880 --> 16:48.520]  the government yeah you used to have to get that even for military officers
[16:48.520 --> 16:51.400]  because you can't just have the president hiring his guys Congress has got
[16:51.400 --> 16:54.760]  approved or you get a military dictatorship under a Julius Caesar oops
[16:54.760 --> 16:59.560]  already happening continuing but as Ron Paul notes in the above video the new
[16:59.560 --> 17:04.720]  agency founded under the Federal Reserve dominated Don Frank Wall Street reform
[17:04.720 --> 17:09.240]  and Consumer Protection Act which is oh you don't like the sharks nibbling at

[17:24.280 --> 17:28.720]  continuing but as Ron Paul notes the above video the new agency founded under
[17:28.720 --> 17:32.800]  the Federal Reserve dominated Don Frank Wall Street reform and Consumer
[17:32.800 --> 17:40.360]  Protection Act it's going to protect you is itself an unconstitutional monster
[17:40.360 --> 17:46.080]  that will further degrade the financial health of this country Cordray will act
[17:46.080 --> 17:50.440]  as a czar answerable not the American people but his masters at the Federal
[17:50.440 --> 17:55.640]  Reserve they're the ones that control it like an EU or Soviet era committee it
[17:55.640 --> 18:00.520]  goes on and on it is a devastating article and it's got the intel from
[18:00.520 --> 18:08.680]  Ron Paul breaking it down so please please get this article out to everyone
[18:08.680 --> 18:13.800]  you know it is so important to expose what's happening you're like but it's
[18:13.800 --> 18:19.960]  already past they've already done it but but but see just because they sign a UN
[18:19.960 --> 18:27.520]  Treaty in 1992 declaring agenda 21 smart growth and saying that by a decade of the
[18:27.520 --> 18:31.320]  21st century they would shut down all human progress except for the elites I
[18:31.320 --> 18:36.880]  mean pull it up UN calls for post-industrial society calls for end of
[18:36.880 --> 18:41.400]  the nuclear family calls for compulsory sterilization I mean this is not a
[18:41.400 --> 18:48.280]  conspiracy theory this is a fact look at our article from Friday that got linked
[18:48.280 --> 18:52.840]  on drudgerport.com and other big sites and then I noticed when it got linked
[18:52.840 --> 18:58.560]  on other big neocon sites even mainline Republican sites they said oh look the
[18:58.560 --> 19:04.760]  UN wants this but but Alex Joseph's a cook there's no global government I mean
[19:04.760 --> 19:09.240]  and all I was quoting was a UN press release that Paul Watson linked to and
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.600]  the desert news and I saw one article going why is drudge linking to this
[19:13.600 --> 19:18.400]  crud this is what discredits conservatives is to say there's a UN takeover
[19:18.400 --> 19:25.280]  yeah I mean the UN Ban Ki-moon says we need a global tax internet taxes
[19:25.280 --> 19:31.000]  financial transaction taxes and well-aid taxes to pay the UN itself run by big
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.040]  megabanks that have just gobbled Europe completely and are openly saying no
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.600]  sovereignty but again there's a big New York Times article I'm gonna cover when
[19:38.600 --> 19:43.800]  I get back New York Times activists fight green projects seeing you in plot they
[19:43.800 --> 19:47.920]  they believe it in the imaginary thing calls in 21 then they go on to admit it
[19:47.920 --> 19:53.440]  to Jenna 21 well I have the UN itself telling you what is in 21 is from UN
[19:53.440 --> 19:58.320]  from the UN's own stinking website and I have Swartz and anger and all of them

[24:18.000 --> 24:22.560]  morning my mind exploded a thousand different directions because I've watched
[24:22.560 --> 24:28.200]  the UN hearings on C-SPAN I've read their biological diversity assessments I've
[24:28.200 --> 24:32.480]  got the footage from the 92 Rio meeting where they said post-industrial world
[24:32.480 --> 24:36.160]  we're gonna destroy industrial society the head of the conference Maury
[24:36.160 --> 24:42.560]  Strong there's a video of it it's all online Ted Turner Prince Philip Prince
[24:42.560 --> 24:48.440]  Charles the Queen of the Netherlands Jacques Cousteau saying kill 300 plus
[24:48.440 --> 24:54.560]  thousand people a day you know all of this crazy stuff and then the big
[24:54.560 --> 25:00.440]  multinationals shutting down all their competition I live in Austin that has
[25:00.440 --> 25:04.960]  election fraud people always say Austin's liberal you mean establishment
[25:04.960 --> 25:10.400]  snookered trendies that are anti-human no we're not no we're not Austin has
[25:10.400 --> 25:16.200]  incredible election fraud Austin is a beautiful wonderful city okay Austin is
[25:16.200 --> 25:20.960]  not liberal a small coterie runs things and feeds off of us and they're not
[25:20.960 --> 25:26.040]  liberals they're scum it's not liberal to shut down our city on power plant and
[25:26.040 --> 25:29.520]  shut down another county owned one and shut down a bunch of others and use
[25:29.520 --> 25:34.200]  government regulators and then massively increased prices over 100% in the last
[25:34.200 --> 25:40.440]  two years 80% this year the city council announced and has been fighting over
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.040]  strangely enough Lee laughing well he's pretty bad news has been saying he's
[25:44.040 --> 25:47.960]  against it but only wanting smaller increases and they say though it's for
[25:47.960 --> 25:53.080]  the earth pay more money it's for the earth it's like it's that excuse it's
[25:53.080 --> 25:57.120]  like we're gonna take take you and burn your wife at the stake because we say
[25:57.120 --> 26:01.040]  she's a witch it's you know it's it's it's it's for God or whatever no you're
[26:01.040 --> 26:06.560]  just using that name for power and then I read this New York Times article where
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.680]  these condescending people talk to us like we're five year olds and all these
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.960]  want to be intelligentsia that get the physical paper or read it online or
[26:16.960 --> 26:22.960]  read it on their little Kindle or their iPad who think they're so smart and who
[26:22.960 --> 26:27.600]  will then condescend it people like me and make comments on YouTube or comments
[26:27.600 --> 26:33.200]  on national TV oh he's the guy that thinks the UN's taking over they have
[26:33.200 --> 26:39.040]  UN signs I hadn't been hiking in about two years on some of the main trail heads
[26:39.040 --> 26:42.320]  because I just tend to pull off on the side of the road and go you know hike
[26:42.320 --> 26:46.960]  into the green belts wherever I want to and me and Richard Reeves a few months
[26:46.960 --> 26:50.920]  ago I had Richard you know going along Hikesville because he likes to hike and
[26:50.920 --> 26:54.640]  I like to hike and you know we're going on like little ten mile hikes and stuff
[26:54.640 --> 27:00.720]  and everywhere were UN signs that were part of a UN control system now just
[27:00.720 --> 27:09.240]  like agenda 21 and the biosphere zones and World Heritage sites I mean this is
[27:09.240 --> 27:15.160]  going on everywhere and it's on paper it's under executive order 12,900 and
[27:15.160 --> 27:21.000]  what is it 86 where Bill Clinton signed us over guys let me check that number I
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.440]  haven't checked it in years Bill Clinton executive order handing over Parkland to
[27:24.440 --> 27:29.240]  UN and then the buffer zones around it I mean by the late 90s they were telling
[27:29.240 --> 27:33.960]  people that own their own gold mine 30 miles outside of what in one case
[27:33.960 --> 27:37.600]  Yellowstone you can't have your gold mine anymore because you're 30 miles from
[27:37.600 --> 27:45.320]  the from the UN zone or Bill Clinton signed an executive order blocking
[27:45.320 --> 27:51.240]  southern Utah cold development the only clean burning coal in North America and
[27:51.240 --> 27:55.280]  enough to run the country for over a hundred years perfectly clean no mercury
[27:55.280 --> 28:00.000]  no nothing in it no need for scrubbers none of it makes makes it even cheaper
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.080]  and overnight this was even in mainstream news back in the time of the late
[28:04.080 --> 28:11.120]  90s you can look it up overnight overnight the stocks of the Chinese
[28:11.120 --> 28:18.680]  company doubled one of the only other reserves in the world overnight for
[28:18.680 --> 28:22.960]  whatever reason geologically that similar area of China has the same dinosaur
[28:22.960 --> 28:28.160]  bones a lot of the same whatever as areas of Utah I guess they say back when
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.880]  Pangea was there or something it was a similar development maybe if you believe
[28:32.880 --> 28:38.760]  any of that whatever the point is people need to get that's how this works just
[28:38.760 --> 28:42.960]  like they shut down that big pipeline that was going to supply massive amounts
[28:42.960 --> 28:49.040]  of oil from Canada the US shut it down now they're going to massively increase
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.960]  the profits of Warren Buffett and his trains associated press Bloomberg all
[28:53.960 --> 28:58.320]  wrote he'll make billions just off that a year shipping by train much more
[28:58.320 --> 29:06.520]  expensively massive amounts of oil to the west coast and then in huge ships to
[29:06.520 --> 29:12.480]  China and Japan again you can look it up China gets three new coal power plants
[29:12.480 --> 29:18.880]  a week we have coal plants well about a hundred is being shut down every year we
[29:18.880 --> 29:24.160]  get our plants shut down they get new plants they get oil we get diddly squat
[29:24.160 --> 29:29.800]  and again it's all insider globalist they don't just get money in power they
[29:29.800 --> 29:33.880]  shut off their competition it's right out of Atlas shrug all right now we come
[29:33.880 --> 29:36.640]  back I'm gonna read you this New York Times article that's got me hotter than
[29:36.640 --> 29:43.240]  the pistol again it's the condescension of the scum and it's so pleasing to see
[29:43.240 --> 29:47.400]  them becoming discredited and becoming jokes and the dinosaur horror media
[29:47.400 --> 29:54.600]  imploding on itself we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[34:02.280 --> 34:06.160]  down these crooks and get angry at them and say I don't care if we win or lose
[34:06.160 --> 34:10.560]  I mean I want to win but I'm not even thinking about that you want to get in a
[34:10.560 --> 34:15.200]  fight new world order alright I'm taking the gloves off I'm coming in I'm gonna
[34:15.200 --> 34:20.600]  fight as hard as I can and I'm gonna improvise adapt and learn and we're
[34:20.600 --> 34:24.320]  gonna kick your new world order tail and you know what it's starting to happen
[34:24.320 --> 34:30.280]  and that's my frustration every time good people turn it loose on the new
[34:30.280 --> 34:35.520]  world order every time we get involved every time we simply get off the bench
[34:35.520 --> 34:41.120]  and get up there we have victory and I got to tell you it's shocking sometimes
[34:41.120 --> 34:44.720]  and listeners call and they say well I'm calling it scares me to even call in
[34:44.720 --> 34:48.400]  but then I understand you know the journey of a thousand miles starts of the
[34:48.400 --> 34:53.040]  single step but you should be afraid of letting this system go into place
[34:53.040 --> 34:57.760]  they're already jacking our food and water on record they're already messing
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.800]  with our atmosphere the globalists are already playing God the only thing you
[35:02.800 --> 35:07.080]  should be afraid of is laying there in the ditch for me that's horrifying for
[35:07.080 --> 35:11.680]  me what's horrifying is letting these scum win I take what they do personal
[35:11.680 --> 35:14.920]  a lot of people say well I fight the new world order a little bit but I don't take
[35:14.920 --> 35:19.120]  it personal you know I think it's good to take it personal I think it's good I
[35:19.120 --> 35:22.200]  don't take it personal when some guy flips me off on the highway or I don't
[35:22.200 --> 35:25.360]  take it personal when somebody you know snubs me or acts powerful I don't care
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.160]  about that I take it personal when people try to assault my children with GMO
[35:29.160 --> 35:35.320]  food fluoride aspartame melamine bisphenol a I take it personal when the
[35:35.320 --> 35:40.560]  United States has the highest prison rate obesity rate cancer rate we're the
[35:40.560 --> 35:44.520]  leaders and everything bad by designed by the globalist from the leaders and
[35:44.520 --> 35:49.040]  everything good 60 years ago to the leaders and everything bad by design all
[35:49.040 --> 35:55.800]  the textbooks all the documents I'm angry about it okay and I know where this
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.920]  is leading if we don't turn this around not somewhere pretty now I just asked
[36:00.920 --> 36:03.800]  the guys because right before showtime I was going through the news they'd printed
[36:03.800 --> 36:08.440]  and I saw a piece of news I hadn't seen out of the New York Times and I just said
[36:08.440 --> 36:13.160]  start printing me agenda 21 UN documents government executive orders and then
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.320]  obviously later after the radio show for the for the nightly news or for a
[36:17.320 --> 36:21.680]  special report I'm gonna have to shoot a special report on this just to
[36:21.680 --> 36:28.680]  illustrate how not only does the media spin and lie but how they're arrogant
[36:28.680 --> 36:34.560]  and think you're idiots and see that's the thing it's so frustrating to see
[36:34.560 --> 36:39.520]  people thinking they're informed because they read it in the New York Times and
[36:39.520 --> 36:47.400]  it's a bunch of sophistic garbage it's it's it's just so mindlessly written I
[36:47.400 --> 36:50.320]  mean if I wanted to write for the New World Order it'd be so easy their tricks
[36:50.320 --> 36:54.960]  are so mindless it's written at a sixth grade level and this is what's so called
[36:54.960 --> 37:00.280]  intellectuals I mean nowadays in America it's intellectuals that can even talk or
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.480]  even read pretty soon you'll be an intellectual and seen as a genius if you
[37:04.480 --> 37:12.040]  can tie your shoelaces I mean this is the type this is the type of garbage this
[37:12.040 --> 37:23.120]  is the type of bull that we're talking about here all right let me continue here
[37:23.120 --> 37:39.200]  again going through this information here is the article itself that I've been
[37:39.200 --> 37:43.760]  ranting about from the New York Times now now now listen to how they try to
[37:43.760 --> 37:48.200]  imply this isn't real but then later admit it is real but just that our
[37:48.200 --> 37:55.640]  response is crazy okay and this is all driven towards peer pressure this is all
[37:55.640 --> 38:01.760]  driven towards people that just go with whatever they think is acceptable in
[38:01.760 --> 38:07.760]  society it's so pathetic that people think it's like a sacrament or it's
[38:07.760 --> 38:12.680]  something really special to do whatever the TV says the TV wants to destroy your
[38:12.680 --> 38:17.680]  culture destroy your family it's a private corporate global takeover of the
[38:17.680 --> 38:24.080]  human species it is a wrecking ball a scorched earth takeover of every facet
[38:24.080 --> 38:31.440]  of our world now here's the New York Times insult to intelligence in fact you
[38:31.440 --> 38:35.560]  know we print all the news that's fit to print what an arrogant statement you
[38:35.560 --> 38:42.760]  know that we think is fit to print we print it all no you are an insult to
[38:42.760 --> 38:47.840]  intelligence who get off on steering our society into a collapsed economy just
[38:47.840 --> 38:53.480]  like you're collapsing into a dirty rat hole lies of WMD as you name it
[38:53.480 --> 38:58.640]  activist fight green projects first last time I one of the richest guys in
[38:58.640 --> 39:03.800]  Mexico connected to all sorts of shady stuff is the main owner so I mean that's
[39:03.800 --> 39:11.000]  what you expect from this activist fight green projects seeing you in plot across
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.440]  the country activists with ties to the Tea Party that's the original proto Ron
[39:17.440 --> 39:23.960]  Paul Alex Jones Tea Party not the neocon one that tells people oh we don't
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.880]  want your 1776 shirts here we don't want your fight the New World Order stuff
[39:28.880 --> 39:33.000]  here we don't want your get the UN out of America stuff that's extreme that's
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.880]  what mainline Republicans tell me you shouldn't be so extreme and talk about
[39:36.880 --> 39:40.760]  the UN bad and world government because that just discredits you really you mean
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.000]  when I read a press release from the UN calling for global government and a
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.560]  global tax it's basically already in place but now they're overtly doing it
[39:47.560 --> 39:52.640]  you mean I shouldn't read what bad guy men said last Friday and and link to the
[39:52.640 --> 39:59.600]  UN saying it oh I oh I understand I should be an idiot like you continuing
[39:59.600 --> 40:04.400]  activist fight green projects seeing you in plot always remember the New York
[40:04.400 --> 40:07.880]  Times three four years ago they did a review of the film New World Order that
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.480]  aired on independent film channel some guys followed me around off and on you
[40:12.480 --> 40:16.920]  know a few times and they put out and it was it was an okay film you know they
[40:16.920 --> 40:20.360]  kind of went with the hokey angle and skewed things by focusing on some of
[40:20.360 --> 40:23.360]  the funnier stuff but that's okay I don't mind cuz I know folks are gonna
[40:23.360 --> 40:27.680]  come here and find the real deal what we actually are what we really do but the
[40:27.680 --> 40:30.880]  New York Times reviewed it and said Jones was having a schizophrenic
[40:30.880 --> 40:38.680]  breakdown basically in a Marriott resort center imagining men behind trees and
[40:38.680 --> 40:44.880]  cars following them no we just had Marines flipping us off and helicopters
[40:44.880 --> 40:48.880]  flying around and police putting people up against squad cars and handcuffs and
[40:48.880 --> 40:53.520]  men coming up to us saying you want to attack the State Department with us who
[40:53.520 --> 40:59.360]  were FBI agents and and and black limousines and and and secret service
[40:59.360 --> 41:03.600]  and world leaders all there and Obama hanging out for a day when the whole
[41:03.600 --> 41:07.760]  media was where's Obama and Hillary they've disappeared we call the media and
[41:07.760 --> 41:14.240]  say they're right here and no dinosaur corporate or media would show up I was
[41:14.240 --> 41:19.320]  talking to a nationally syndicated radio host a few days ago I'll just leave
[41:19.320 --> 41:23.760]  it at that and he says he'll come on sometime and talk about it when he's
[41:23.760 --> 41:28.240]  ready but he's talking about being in national newsrooms and watching people
[41:28.240 --> 41:33.560]  say don't go with that don't you know you know no say Ron Paul can't win and and
[41:33.560 --> 41:39.040]  and not allowed to say Bilderberg or New World Order or global government and all
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.840]  these big syndicated radio shows that you hear of course I already knew this
[41:44.840 --> 41:48.760]  they don't just get talking points but they have them delayed more like a
[41:48.760 --> 41:55.120]  minute they're delayed like a minute and they're going through different
[41:55.120 --> 42:00.160]  computer banks so that they can cut what the host is saying and I already knew
[42:00.160 --> 42:02.920]  this but the extent of it was incredible and of course I'm not supposed to talk
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.840]  about it well specifically who told me but I already know this it's just if the
[42:06.840 --> 42:10.440]  public knew you think when you call up a regular talk show even local and they
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.640]  screen you for like five minutes and and and if you ever want to talk about the
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.280]  New World Order or Ron Paul they don't want to put you on this is about
[42:18.280 --> 42:22.280]  perception management it's about a bunch of scum and sellouts who are
[42:22.280 --> 42:27.280]  destroying their own future by serving the New World Order feeding you
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.800]  propaganda and getting off on it I've run into local people I try to call in to
[42:32.800 --> 42:38.360]  San Antonio and Austin stations and they maybe in the past once a week driving
[42:38.360 --> 42:41.720]  into work or driving home or doing errands you know I don't just tell
[42:41.720 --> 42:44.600]  people to talk to folks at grocery stores and stop people at red lights and
[42:44.600 --> 42:50.120]  tell them to an inter radio stations or you know do whatever I do it myself but
[42:50.120 --> 42:54.760]  but I can't call into Texas talk radio because even though I might call one
[42:54.760 --> 42:59.000]  show once a month the call screeners like no Alex I recognize your voice but
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.200]  I'm like but I want to make this point no why don't you do it on your own show
[43:03.200 --> 43:09.320]  and I'm and I can even call and say my name is David or Bob now a few times I've
[43:09.320 --> 43:13.480]  called and said I'd like to come on talk about this and they get me on there and
[43:13.480 --> 43:18.680]  I'd give them some information and the voice is like this but but I mean a lot
[43:18.680 --> 43:22.040]  of times I'm not going to go to that link to try to jump through the call
[43:22.040 --> 43:29.240]  screeners power trip again these servile people get off on serving the system
[43:29.240 --> 43:35.400]  they they think it like makes them powerful to serve the New World Order as
[43:35.400 --> 43:40.400]  their standard living implodes but up here it is activist fight green projects
[43:40.400 --> 43:48.560]  sing you in plot this is what the Mexican mega bank drug laundering funded
[43:48.560 --> 43:53.960]  New York Times wants to tell you here's some nice people activist fight green
[43:53.960 --> 44:02.080]  projects sing you in plot and it goes on across the country here I'll hold it a
[44:02.080 --> 44:05.720]  little bit higher for easy to document him shut there you go activist fight
[44:05.720 --> 44:10.080]  green projects sing you in plot oh there's no such thing as plots by big
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.360]  mega elites they just got into power by being nice little people rich powerful
[44:14.360 --> 44:18.000]  men never get in smoky rooms and they don't have mistresses either and they
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.880]  never order assassinations either and they're not involved in any corruption
[44:20.880 --> 44:26.200]  and oh yes across the country activists would ties to the Tea Party or
[44:26.200 --> 44:31.440]  railing against all sorts of local and state efforts to control sprawl and
[44:31.440 --> 44:38.880]  conserve energy no you mean shell them less energy for more they brand
[44:38.880 --> 44:42.800]  government action just it's action you want action so you're conditioned to
[44:42.800 --> 44:46.880]  love action action action like it's always good for things like expanding
[44:46.880 --> 44:50.640]  public transportation routes I mean shutting down your rows and giving
[44:50.640 --> 44:53.360]  sweetheart train deals to people that you can't even use because the way our
[44:53.360 --> 44:58.040]  infrastructure set up and preserving open space as part of the United Nations
[44:58.040 --> 45:01.640]  led conspiracy so they admit that's all happening but it's the United Nations
[45:01.640 --> 45:06.000]  led conspiracy no it's not a conspiracy it's an open program of neo feudalism in
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.280]  their own words they say neo feudalism neo serfdom I didn't really coin those
[45:10.280 --> 45:16.920]  terms neo feudalistic serfdom I did they call it neo feudal or neo serf
[45:16.920 --> 45:21.360]  systems read the UN biological diversity assessment 1996 I mean it's
[45:21.360 --> 45:27.600]  incredible read super memorandum 200 where they say we'll have wars and cut
[45:27.600 --> 45:35.880]  off food to reduce population and it goes on and preserving open space is part
[45:35.880 --> 45:39.280]  of the United Nations led conspiracy to deny property rights and herd citizens
[45:39.280 --> 45:42.840]  towards cities well they say all that and in Austin they took in one swath
[45:42.840 --> 45:47.160]  15,000 acres of different farm and ranchers property southwest of town
[45:47.160 --> 45:51.640]  held it for five years as we knew they do use taxpayer money to force the sale
[45:51.640 --> 45:56.600]  imminent domain took it paid about two cents on the dollar in some cases had to
[45:56.600 --> 46:01.560]  send police out to drag them off their land people crying on their ancestral
[46:01.560 --> 46:06.840]  property and turned around and actually the former mayors and everybody moved in
[46:06.840 --> 46:10.760]  on the land built three million dollar houses sold their buddies built hotels
[46:10.760 --> 46:14.800]  and now they're grabbing other property I mean they just do it I mean it's like
[46:14.800 --> 46:19.840]  we have machine guns we're taking the property and they said it's for the UN
[46:19.840 --> 46:25.200]  they got UN signs up I mean I was over at the Hill of Life's the local name of it
[46:25.200 --> 46:28.840]  I forget the exact name the little park entrance down into the green belt some
[46:28.840 --> 46:32.680]  of the older green belts that the other can't build in the Barton Creek Canyon
[46:32.680 --> 46:38.760]  area and it's got little UN signs there now but it doesn't exist kind of like
[46:38.760 --> 46:42.720]  CNN said four years ago and I played the clip many times Ron Paul's insane the
[46:42.720 --> 46:48.560]  guy said the the the host he's or it was a contributor he's insane he believes
[46:48.560 --> 46:51.440]  there's something called a North American Union highway and that the trans
[46:51.440 --> 46:54.440]  and there's a thing called transdictus corridor he claims he's making it up it
[46:54.440 --> 46:58.240]  doesn't exist there were signs everywhere toll roads going in we defeated it for
[46:58.240 --> 47:00.240]  now and overthrew it but the signs were everywhere
[47:00.240 --> 47:04.760]  imagine being a Texan watching CNN and they're saying this doesn't exist when
[47:04.760 --> 47:07.720]  it's all over the news and the transportation department announced
[47:07.720 --> 47:13.560]  at the state and federal level but most people watching in Texas went oh it
[47:13.560 --> 47:16.800]  doesn't exist well I won't talk about it the water cooler even though it's
[47:16.800 --> 47:21.480]  happening I don't want to be laughed at I had Texans say it didn't exist as it was
[47:21.480 --> 47:26.200]  happening because CNN said so and they get this little smile this little really
[47:26.200 --> 47:30.880]  your conspiracy theories like I got lied to mmm big establishment media told me
[47:30.880 --> 47:36.040]  so I'm part of the power system I got lied to and God feels so good I mean
[47:36.040 --> 47:40.800]  it's like a mental sickness of weakness and just loving servile patheticness I
[47:40.800 --> 47:45.840]  mean that that's what we're talking about here it goes on it's horrible
[47:45.840 --> 47:49.440]  they're showing up they say at city council meetings this is some terrible
[47:49.440 --> 47:55.120]  news they're showing up it's so un-American that planning meetings to denounce
[47:55.120 --> 48:00.880]  bike lanes yeah where they make you turn the parking drives the backwards so
[48:00.880 --> 48:03.400]  people have wrecks they take over existing roads to give them to bikes
[48:03.400 --> 48:07.680]  they play bikers off against car drivers and the bikers get on major
[48:07.680 --> 48:13.600]  highways now interstates and block the roads and enjoy it again it's all about
[48:13.600 --> 48:17.640]  divide and conquer they're showing up at planning meetings to denounce bike lanes
[48:17.640 --> 48:21.200]  on public streets and smart meters on home appliances which they admit are
[48:21.200 --> 48:24.280]  tracking everybody in taxing and now controlling thermostats in California
[48:24.280 --> 48:27.400]  which they promised they wouldn't but that was a conspiracy theory to efforts
[48:27.400 --> 48:31.280]  they equate to big government blueprint against individual rights yeah it's
[48:31.280 --> 48:35.400]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement down the road this data will be used
[48:35.400 --> 48:39.760]  against you it is now warned a speaker at the recent Rowan Oak County Virginia
[48:39.760 --> 48:43.760]  Board of Supervisors meeting who turned out with dozens of people opposed to the
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.960]  county paying 1200 and dues to a nonprofit that consults on sustainability
[48:48.960 --> 48:53.760]  issues of the consults to yeah then the universities are turning out all these
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.280]  graduates who will be your little minders your little keepers and that's
[48:58.280 --> 49:01.200]  gonna be their profession so they're gonna be acolytes of it no matter what to
[49:01.200 --> 49:07.080]  force you to do whatever they say home inspections more power bills local
[49:07.080 --> 49:11.920]  officials say they would dismiss such notions except for the growing and
[49:11.920 --> 49:17.640]  often heated protest are having an effect oh well the people are actually
[49:17.640 --> 49:21.560]  reading the UN documents we're about to show you it's terrible they're
[49:21.560 --> 49:28.080]  Americans are having an effect that means the richest man in Mexico tied in
[49:28.080 --> 49:34.320]  with the big megabanks that owns the New York Times Carlos swim it means we
[49:34.320 --> 49:37.600]  won't get to be like people in Mexico who had all their resources turned off
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.760]  and are so poor the establishment calls them peons I mean they want to make us
[49:42.760 --> 49:48.800]  peons here this is terrible we don't want to be in Maine the Tea Party back
[49:48.800 --> 49:52.240]  Republican governor canceled the project to ease congestion along route one
[49:52.240 --> 49:55.640]  corridor a protesters complaint was part of a UN plot yeah where they take
[49:55.640 --> 49:59.240]  existing lanes and term of the toll roads that makes things worse similar
[49:59.240 --> 50:03.640]  opposition helped doom the high-speed train line in Florida and more than a
[50:03.640 --> 50:07.640]  dozen cities towns and counties under new pressure have cut off financing for a
[50:07.640 --> 50:12.880]  program that offers expertise on how to measure and cut carbon emissions yeah
[50:12.880 --> 50:19.000]  where they then start taxing you you know that's the issue here that we're
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.520]  talking about they put taxes on you I mean I told her by they were gonna
[50:22.520 --> 50:26.600]  increase our power bill boy they're awake in Austin now with that 80%
[50:26.600 --> 50:34.640]  increase coming in in one year already a massive increase it sounds a little on
[50:34.640 --> 50:39.600]  the weird side but we found we're here we ignored our own peril oh it sounds a
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.760]  little weird that people are actually informed I said George Homewood a vice
[50:43.760 --> 50:47.640]  president of American Planning Association chapter in Virginia where
[50:47.640 --> 50:51.080]  they're annexing this the the rural areas and telling folks what they can do in
[50:51.080 --> 50:56.040]  their own land or how about the EPA last year saying the $5,000 fines for dust on
[50:56.040 --> 51:00.280]  a farm oh yeah taking all our property for no reason we shouldn't be concerned
[51:00.280 --> 51:05.560]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[51:05.560 --> 51:09.280]  pretty good sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[51:09.280 --> 51:13.320]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[51:13.320 --> 51:16.800]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[51:16.800 --> 51:21.440]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[51:21.440 --> 51:25.880]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then

[54:46.480 --> 54:50.600]  reactors constantly melting down radiation levels going up globally not
[54:50.600 --> 54:55.280]  even an issue troops dying of DU poisoning but they're gonna raise taxes
[54:55.280 --> 54:58.480]  on your breathing New York Times headline attacks on breathing and then
[54:58.480 --> 55:04.920]  they endorsed it they said this is good but it goes on to freak out the long
[55:04.920 --> 55:11.280]  article that all over the country people are waking up to the UN takeover and
[55:11.280 --> 55:17.480]  freaking out and that smart growth groups are in trouble and that people are
[55:17.480 --> 55:21.440]  coming after them and making sure that the cities aren't run by smart growth
[55:21.440 --> 55:27.320]  software that the feds give you grants to run your city on I mean everything is
[55:27.320 --> 55:31.400]  converting over to this where they say you'll pay for the calories you eat this
[55:31.400 --> 55:36.480]  is all official and they're stalling you till it's in place and they're upset
[55:36.480 --> 55:42.480]  that you're waking up and they can't take over with their mafia system that's
[55:42.480 --> 55:46.000]  all this is they can shut anybody down for made-up environmental reasons I saw
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.840]  Tito's vodka now become very popular all the world I'm told it's really good
[55:51.840 --> 55:58.360]  vodka people that like vodka drink it and they said that a few gallons of some
[55:58.360 --> 56:02.520]  of their distillate might have run into a creek behind them a disgruntled
[56:02.520 --> 56:06.600]  employee said so they swat team them and indicted them and all this stuff
[56:06.600 --> 56:12.880]  meanwhile the globalist artist are infecting the very genome and releasing
[56:12.880 --> 56:16.680]  salmon into the ocean that they admit in university studies in controlled
[56:16.680 --> 56:23.520]  environments will extinct all natural salmon of that species I mean that's
[56:23.520 --> 56:28.440]  the threat right there not some Tito's vodka that ran off in a creek I mean I
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.240]  saw where they were inditing and arresting people in Dallas cuz some pig
[56:31.240 --> 56:37.200]  blood from a slaughterhouse might have gotten the Trinity River pig blood you
[56:37.200 --> 56:40.520]  better be aware and all the people that are worried about kosher stuff Muslims
[56:40.520 --> 56:45.960]  Jews and others or Christian scientists 70 Adventists whatever aren't you worried
[56:45.960 --> 56:50.800]  about genetics of other animals and insects in your food and that's a lot
[56:50.800 --> 56:55.800]  bigger than any other type of contamination you could imagine but the
[56:55.800 --> 56:59.520]  article goes on freaking out the protest date to 92 when the United Nations
[56:59.520 --> 57:03.400]  passed a sweeping but non-binding 100 plus page resolution college in a 21
[57:03.400 --> 57:06.840]  there was a sign of encouraged nations to use fewer resources yeah post
[57:06.840 --> 57:11.000]  industrial world and conserve open land by steering development to already dense
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.520]  areas at the globalist own they have gained momentum in the past two years
[57:16.520 --> 57:20.840]  because of the emergence of the tea party movement harnessing its suspicion
[57:20.840 --> 57:25.560]  about government power will know everybody's being abused and and and the
[57:25.560 --> 57:29.440]  belief that the man-made global warming is a hoax see they say man-made global
[57:29.440 --> 57:33.000]  warming is real but the belief that it's a hoax and the whole it just gets worse
[57:33.000 --> 57:40.200]  I mean it gets worse folks here's here's ban chi moon in info wars calm UN
[57:40.200 --> 57:44.200]  wants world tax to help the poor what do we link to in the article a UN press
[57:44.200 --> 57:49.680]  release here on the UN's website people didn't believe our article they thought
[57:49.680 --> 57:55.520]  it was fake okay here is the actual desert news mainstream media they
[57:55.520 --> 58:02.360]  got the headline here desert news UN leaders consider world tax to fund
[58:02.360 --> 58:07.600]  social protection services which is just the new social anti-family police now
[58:07.600 --> 58:16.520]  here's Schwarzenegger in the time magazine London Guardian and USA today
[58:16.520 --> 58:20.640]  and you read him three years ago at the Copenhagen thing when they couldn't get
[58:20.640 --> 58:25.880]  through he said what we need now is an in-run to county cities and states to
[58:25.880 --> 58:33.240]  implement the agenda 21 I mean go read it go read it here he is saying exactly
[58:33.240 --> 58:37.520]  what we're warning I mean and then because we know what they're doing we're
[58:37.520 --> 58:53.440]  bad conspiracy theorist you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs
[58:53.440 --> 58:57.160]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal
[58:57.160 --> 59:01.160]  silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung
[59:01.160 --> 59:04.680]  system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere

[59:17.840 --> 59:22.760]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key
[59:22.760 --> 59:29.840]  target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and

[1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:28.040]  all right instead of looking at fake threats to humanity like the terrorist
[1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:30.880]  threat you got a better chance being killed by champagne corks or honeybees
[1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:37.400]  we're gonna look at real threats to our society with a really well well research
[1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:45.080]  gentleman coming up the next segment then we have a big Harvard expert on the
[1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:49.920]  environmental internet takeover that we see happening that's all coming up
[1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:53.960]  getting back to the environmentalist here who are not environmentalist that
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:57.280]  way they can toxify genetically engineered to whatever they want and
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:00.960]  then only brand your private property is something they got a take to save the
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:05.160]  earth and tax you for breathing and tax you for your electricity and shut down
[1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:09.000]  all their competition and call for a world government world army world
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:14.920]  courts into the nuclear family and a quote post industrial world except for
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:20.400]  high-tech government and industry reservations this is all agenda 21 and
[1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:23.000]  they're freaking out because you're finding out about it here's the New
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:27.560]  York Times saying all over the country people believe in a plot when we're
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:31.520]  trying to take your property and raise your power prices and not let you build
[1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:34.480]  or cut down a tree in your backyard or build a shed on your own property or
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:37.920]  when we take your farm you see all the cases where they take people's farms and
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:43.400]  make them pay for the EPA assessment to have their farm taken that's now at the
[1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:48.440]  Supreme Court because there's a pond on it that they say is a wetland in fact
[1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:51.840]  now they're saying don't dig with bulldozers a cow pond because they'll
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:54.960]  come along and call it a wetland and take your property I mean that they're
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:59.480]  actually doing it here in Texas for the trans Texas corridor they took hundreds
[1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:03.840]  of thousands of acres and then sold it for restaurants and hotels on major
[1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:08.640]  highways imminent domain all over the state and would say it's for the earth
[1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:13.080]  we're taking it and then sell it and put hotels on it McDonald's I mean it's just
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:18.280]  a little we've got an old family ranch in East Texas and we got the new Texas
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:22.240]  landowners rights thing a few years ago and it said under the new Texas bill of
[1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:26.160]  land or bill of rights you have no rights if we want your property or put a
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:30.240]  pipeline on it or whatever you've got six weeks to accept our offer or you get
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:36.360]  nothing and if you take us to court you will pay for the fees so here's your
[1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:41.920]  rights you don't have it jack squad it's for the earth a trendy it's not for the
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:49.560]  earth it's about a total takeover so here is USA Today bad economy helps cut
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:53.920]  CO2 emissions here they are saying shutting you down as good USA Today and
[1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:57.600]  then I had had it earlier they gave it to me here it is UN.org
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:05.680]  gender 21 and then they describe what it is and they admit a plan to basically
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:12.800]  shut down society what they call sustainability some good news China
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:16.600]  bans airlines from joining EU emissions scheme they're making all our airlines
[1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:20.240]  now when you fly to Europe you're gonna pay for the carbon that's put out as if
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:24.600]  it's the only evil thing on earth here it is Schwarzenegger pushes for regional
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:30.720]  climate change pack we have folks a document cam of that USA Today this is
[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:35.960]  November 15th 2010 when the Copenhagen Treaty failed they tried to keep the
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:39.880]  treaty secret but it leaked that would actually double or right at double the
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:42.880]  taxes on the third world they tried to sell the third world that they were
[1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:45.960]  going to get the rich guys and increase our taxes but no it's actually a
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:50.680]  doubling on them and about a 50% increase on us be a death sentence for the
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:54.800]  third world though over a billion would die within a decade or the breakdowns
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:58.120]  that have been done the actuaries but here it is Schwarzenegger pushes for
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:02.720]  regional climate change pack and he goes on to say because they couldn't get it
[1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:10.200]  through the third rail would be getting local governments to do it and it goes
[1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:15.280]  on in the year since an attempt for a final global climate change treaty
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:19.520]  failed California has been trying to be different strategy to reduce greenhouse
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:23.880]  gases worldwide Governor Schwarzenegger and he said this at the time is pushing
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:27.320]  state and regional governments around the globe to act saying that the effort
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:31.680]  must be led by the localities in the absence of natural international
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:36.280]  momentum yeah states and counties and of course when that happens the feds
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:41.600]  stand by and go because because the EPA ignores Congress when they say don't do
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:45.980]  carbon taxes they just do it so it's the same thing here and in Austin they
[1:04:45.980 --> 1:04:50.000]  said we're massively going to increase your power prices for the earth now a
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.680]  private group gets the money but it's for the earth and the trendies went oh
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:59.800]  let us suck our thumbs please financially rape us we love it

[1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:19.720]  well you know listeners that in Nebraska two places in Canada in Illinois in
[1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:24.800]  the Carolinas in New York in fact I had Aaron Dykes look it up last week it was
[1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:32.400]  48 releases in North America alone of radiation that we know of in the last
[1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:37.200]  year and we've shown you the headlines you can type it in yourself you know
[1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:42.520]  mystery in Europe why are radiation levels going up you know it's not from
[1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:46.680]  Chernobyl in 86 it's not from Fukushima we know some of the radiation levels
[1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:50.700]  have gone up here because of Fukushima and it's still ongoing why are the
[1:08:50.700 --> 1:08:55.720]  levels going up and and and I don't know why there's so many more disasters or
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:08:59.760]  so many more problems we know there was a big reactor in the 50s melted down
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:04.680]  completely a sodium reactor bigger than Chernobyl and and it wasn't till the
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:10.200]  90s that they declassified that there'd been a total meltdown and radiating
[1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:14.480]  California and many other areas so who knows what's going on you know there is
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:19.400]  two experimental reactors at the University of Texas at the JJ Pickle
[1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:23.600]  Center my dad was going to UT in the 60s they had a little one downtown now
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:28.680]  they've moved that but have a bigger research facility at the JJ Pickle
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:33.160]  Center up off 183 and the you know moped back up in North Austin and it's got a
[1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:37.360]  bar bar fence around it and it's a huge compound and you tell locals you know
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:40.720]  there's nuclear reactors over there and they go no there's not conspiracy
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:46.120]  theorist I mean this is the level of denial hey you know all these major
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:50.160]  GMO crops have been proven to sterilize every mammal species that eat them the
[1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:54.360]  corn the maize the soybean no they're not hey you know DU and the major studies
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:57.560]  about the former head of the DU program under Doug Rocky on it's killing
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:01.040]  almost everybody that's involved cleaning the tank barrels and we can give
[1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:05.280]  them the names of the young men dying it's like no no no it's not what is the
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:09.080]  New York Times saying you don't like the carbon taxes your conspiracy theorist
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:14.520]  all of this is going on so I saw an article that we linked to an info
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:19.480]  wars comm last week that for my own research was spot-on and and so I
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:22.760]  thought I'd look at a few of the real threats in fact it was even a USA Today
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:28.040]  article that also saw Friday that said you know scientists worried
[1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:31.800]  about volcanoes because they're now learning that volcanoes aren't going
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:36.320]  off every million years or so like they thought no big ones are going off more
[1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:41.000]  often we're getting hit by asteroids more often it all brings into question
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:44.400]  the age of the earth I don't know how old it is four billion a billion of ten
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:48.960]  million I don't know it's clear those scientists don't know when asteroid
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:52.440]  strikes happen more often just like whenever Saturn got hit by Shoemaker
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:57.040]  leavey comment all of that has really changed things but I do know from the
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:03.360]  physicist nuclear physicist many others that we've interviewed over the years
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:07.440]  when we've interviewed the director of the harp program that when there have
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:11.240]  been big solar flares that hit the earth straight on that the ionizing
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:15.480]  different types of radiation has caused all the power lines to blow up you know
[1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:19.960]  power outages this is even a hundred years ago so the question is if a big
[1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:26.120]  solar flare or EMP was to hit what would it do to the hundreds and hundreds of
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:30.520]  nuclear reactors and you want to talk about a detailed report I mean it is
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:35.240]  it's long but it's a quick read with maps documents cases where reactors have
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:38.400]  already had trouble that I didn't even know about but went and looked up it's
[1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:45.360]  true it's 400 Chernobyl solar flares EMPs and nuclear armageddon by Matthew
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:50.960]  Stein and going over his bio here a Matthew Stein is a design engineer
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:54.760]  green builder again I'm all for green building I'm just against paying carbon
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:59.080]  taxes to foreign banks and author of two best-selling books when disaster
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:02.960]  strikes a comprehensive guide to emergency planning and crisis excellent
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:08.240]  book I've read it put out in 2011 and when technology fails a manual for
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:11.520]  self-reliance I haven't read that yet but I ordered it sustainability and
[1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:15.880]  surviving the long emergency and again I'm for real sustainability not the
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:20.400]  counterfeit that means build three coal plants in China a week and we don't get
[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:24.920]  to have any we're just or cut that shut off our our oil and ship it all to China
[1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:28.720]  and block new alternative energies for being developed see it's about a
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:33.840]  monopoly but I'm digressing Stein is a graduate Massachusetts technology where
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:37.360]  he majored in mechanical engineering Stein has appeared on every show you
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:41.080]  can imagine and he's also a guest columnist for the having a post and he
[1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:45.320]  joins us to go over what real threats are because they've got these hot dog
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:48.960]  people Fox News took our headline and said Homeland Security hires wiener
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:52.800]  watchers the hot dog vendors acting like everybody's a terrorist you got a
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:56.080]  better chance being killed by champagne corks honey bees or deer jumping out in
[1:12:56.080 --> 1:13:00.400]  front of you look at the statistics we've gone over them here so what are the
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:04.160]  real threats what are the real threats and this is a real one we've only had
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:09.360]  you know nuclear power engineering on a mass scale the last 30 40 years and we've
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:13.520]  had it for 60 70 in submarines but I guess the first one was the Nautilus or
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:20.480]  whatever but now it's proliferating and now they've got the greenies pushing
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:25.640]  your neighborhood reactors oh that's another wonderful idea so so we've got
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:30.440]  him with us for the rest of the hour and then we have another guest joining us
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:35.680]  Lawrence Lessig and he's an expert on the attack on free speech and the
[1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:39.880]  internet and how Congress has been corrupted but good to have you with us
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:46.200]  Mr. Stein we appreciate you coming on and we appreciate your article but please
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:52.360]  you know break down as best you can what you put in this big paper okay well
[1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:57.880]  here it is you're you're genuine this is a real threat this is like a guaranteed
[1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:05.000]  Armageddon this is an event that we haven't seen on this planet since 65
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  million years ago when an asteroid hit or who knows what exactly happened but
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.520]  something wiped out all the dinosaurs in a short period of time and this is a
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:21.080]  totally avoidable event so here's the situation solar storms hit our planet
[1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:25.440]  fairly often we've had in the last 150 years we've had about a hundred
[1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:30.400]  significant storms we had one week ago where they had to read you know reroute
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:34.160]  some Delta flights over the North Pole because of the ionizing radiation this
[1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:39.800]  was a this is basically when the Sun burps it gives like a huge mass called a
[1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:44.960]  coronal mass ejection when stuff from the Sun gets launched out into space now
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:48.440]  why this happens all the time solar minimum solar maximums but most of the
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:52.120]  time it's not aimed towards our planet so it just goes off into space no big
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:55.320]  deal now and then it hits our planet well now and then it hits our planet
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:02.480]  really really big so back in 1921 there was a solar storm where it lit up the
[1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:06.920]  sky blood orange green yellow streaks all kinds of things all the way from the
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:11.960]  North Pole down to Puerto Rico and Haiti and all the way from the South Pole to
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:16.680]  Samoa so every place on the planet got this incredible light show except for a
[1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:22.720]  narrow band around the around the equator now back then when it happened it was
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:27.040]  like no big deal nobody you know very few maybe a few people died some telegraph
[1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:31.000]  stations burned down Penn Central Station burned down from from induced
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:35.480]  currents that started fires but there were no nuclear power plants there was
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:41.200]  no microelectronics there was no giant power grid well fast forward to today
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:47.480]  if we had a storm like the 1921 one that was 90 years ago and before that the
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:52.080]  next extreme one before that was in 1859 called the Carrington event similar
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:57.800]  light show only went on for an entire week there was two giant CMEs space five
[1:15:57.800 --> 1:16:01.960]  days apart one blasted and then a few days later another one blasted out of
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:06.280]  the Sun it hit the planet Earth and so the first one kind of got the magnetosphere
[1:16:06.280 --> 1:16:10.920]  spinning and all the electronic interactions going on the planet kind of
[1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:14.440]  revved up like revving up an engine and then the second one hit a few days later
[1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:19.640]  and revved it up to high gear so if either of those happen today we've got
[1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:24.640]  over a hundred thousand miles of high voltage extra high voltage power lines
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:29.040]  uniting the grid in in the United States alone over a hundred thousand miles so
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:35.160]  these power lines are gonna act like a giant antenna and they're gonna they're
[1:16:35.160 --> 1:16:40.200]  gonna take this energy from space that's been induced from these charged
[1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:43.880]  particles hitting our upper atmosphere and they're gonna they're gonna suck it
[1:16:43.880 --> 1:16:49.240]  up and when they do they're gonna send thousands of volts and amps down these
[1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:53.960]  lines and there's there's transformers called extra high voltage transformers
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:59.240]  that they started putting into our grid in the late 60s mostly in the 70s 80s
[1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:04.760]  and 90s they upgraded the grid in North America and what happens is is when
[1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:11.160]  when this grid gets zapped by all of this energy from outer space then it it's
[1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:16.040]  it's like the grid is operating on synchronized you know it's 60 volts 60
[1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:19.520]  cycles like all of our lights everything's going at 60 cycles it's gonna
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:23.360]  totally fry everything and blow them out as you said you've got photos and news
[1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:28.200]  reports when the power lines the last time this happened you know lit up red
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:32.080]  and melted are just those are just telegraph lines what is this gonna do
[1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.240]  this is gonna be wild this is gonna blow this is gonna blow the
[1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:39.360]  transformers and when it does now people say well can't you just go down you know
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:42.240]  to the hardware store and buy a new transformer well these transformers are
[1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:48.640]  like 300 tons each and they're multi-million dollars and they're all
[1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:53.400]  custom designed and custom built so it takes three years now to buy a single
[1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:58.880]  transformer now in 1989 we had a big GM magnetic storm one tenth the size of the
[1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:04.960]  1921 storm which was supposedly 50% less than the 1859 so 1989 we have a big
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:09.000]  storm way bigger than the one we had a week ago way bigger and that Friday
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:15.160]  transformer in Quebec knocked out power to nine million people for something
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:19.840]  like six hours it also prior to transformer in the East Coast and it
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:25.840]  prior to transformer in in the UK but this is only two in North America and
[1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:31.240]  it almost caused a cascading failure well the 1921 one that the the science
[1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:35.960]  modeling says it's gonna fry and cook 350 or more of these transformers in the
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:39.480]  United States two thousand worldwide well in the whole world we make about a
[1:18:39.480 --> 1:18:43.600]  hundred of these a year so if we get two thousand worldwide that's like 20 years of
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:47.560]  production now all of a sudden grid down grid collapse it's taken a hundred years
[1:18:47.560 --> 1:18:51.800]  to build this grid up to where it is and then and if it's anywhere near like
[1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:54.560]  you're saying the one that hit over a hundred years ago this would be
[1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:59.080]  devastating do we have any actuaries or ideas on how on how much would get
[1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:04.920]  knocked out yeah we're talking that we're talking 350 in North America two
[1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:10.200]  thousand in the world for the 1921 storm that's what the meta tech study you
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:16.400]  know it was it was Sandia national labs Oak Ridge national lab they all checked
[1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:20.360]  it so this is a big study and this has been checked and verified so they know
[1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:23.680]  this and they're just sitting there waiting for it to happen well here's a
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:27.840]  thing they put bills for since 2008 they've had two different bills in
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:31.160]  Congress and they've narrowly avoid passing it the latest one's called the
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:34.960]  shield act but the shield act is still kind of silly it's like the shield act
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:38.360]  says well you we're not gonna do anything we're the government but we're
[1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:41.880]  gonna make the utilities do something you know spend a couple billion dollars
[1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:46.720]  to fix this problem and and then if they don't like it then they can appeal to us
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:50.120]  and get some financial help but the problem is the utilities are saying we

[1:24:06.360 --> 1:24:12.120]  here in about 40 minutes we'll take a few calls we have specific questions for
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:17.640]  our guest Matthew Stein author of when disaster strikes someone technology
[1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:24.480]  fails that's selling author MIT a design engineer and builder obviously as well
[1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:30.920]  as a writer and when when technology fails.com is one of the websites you
[1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:36.120]  can visit it's excellent he put out this big report 400 chair nobles solar flare
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:41.400]  EMP and nuclear armageddon because it's bad enough to have years of power
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:45.840]  outages and problems and infrastructure damage but getting into the reactors this
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:51.480]  is a short segment long segment coming up mr. Stein but but obviously it's the
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:55.440]  reactors are one of the biggest threats correct yeah the reactors are the end of
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:24:59.800]  the world as we know it problem and this is the one where it's a no-brainer we
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:03.440]  could solve this problem I mean there's no way to protect against all the bad
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:08.280]  effects of an EMP or a solar storm but we can protect against nuclear armageddon
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:13.240]  now here's the here's the ticket with nuclear power plants when Fukushima blew
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:18.760]  up and melted down it wasn't a quote at least according to Japanese authorities
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:24.600]  it wasn't the direct effects of the nuclear of the the large 9.0 earthquake
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:30.640]  it was the after effect of the tsunami and I'll explain when the power every
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:36.040]  nuclear power plant has to keep its core cooled or it's going to melt down you're
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:41.280]  generating like millions and millions of BTUs instantly in the in the power core
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:45.760]  and that heat is used to generate all the power and electricity out of steam
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:50.920]  steam generators well if you stop running the fluid through that core all that
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:53.760]  extra heat is going to go somewhere it's going to melt the core down and blow the
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:26:00.600]  reactor so in Fukushima blew after the tsunamis came in and wiped out the
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:05.200]  backup generators see whenever the grid goes down every nuclear reactor goes
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:12.560]  into automatic shutdown mode where the reactor fuel rods and the control rods
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:16.400]  mesh together and start cooling it down but there's so much heat in there and
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:20.180]  the reactor doesn't stop like flipping a switch so you got to keep that cool for
[1:26:20.180 --> 1:26:24.400]  the next three to five years you got a cool reactor rods after you start
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:30.160]  shutting them down so what happened then is earthquake hit reactor cut off from
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:34.760]  the grid grid went down grid failed reactor goes in a shutdown mode the
[1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:38.600]  backup generators kick on the backup batteries kick in and they keep the
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:43.560]  cooling pumps going well you know 20 minutes later the tsunami comes along
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:48.320]  wipes out the cooling pumps a couple hours later you're going snap crackle
[1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:52.120]  pop you're you're melting down the cores and you're generating you're
[1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:56.400]  dissociating water into hydrogen and oxygen making explosive gases blow in
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:01.680]  the containment vessel and we all saw what happened now fast forward we get a
[1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:07.640]  big giant solar storm and not like the little one not like the not like the
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:12.280]  the you know the big one we get an extreme one big one 1989 cause problems
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:18.080]  big one 2003 fried 14 transformers in South Africa screwed up the grid for an
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:21.680]  entire year rolling blackouts the whole country for year for only 14
[1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:26.840]  transformers gone fast forward we get one like 1921 we got a solar maximum
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:32.360]  coming up into 2012 beginning of 2013 we get one like 1921 they're really worried
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:36.160]  science are looking like we might have a big one like that all of a sudden
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:41.080]  grids totally collapsed down for years in places some places back short-term but
[1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:44.680]  where the dense population is that's where the nuclear reactors are that's
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:48.840]  where the grid collapses where it's dense that's where it collapses now all of a
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:53.880]  sudden you got chaos nobody's nobody's getting food nobody's getting gas no
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:58.920]  pumps to pump no fuel refined in the refineries everything down over most of
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:02.680]  the industrialized parts of the planet except for the deep tropical zones that
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:07.200]  disconnected from other parts of the grid suddenly the government promises
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:11.880]  that they're gonna show up at these reactors with diesel fuel like clockwork
[1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:17.040]  to make sure they're all working all 104 reactors in America we got one third
[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:21.520]  more than one third 37 percent of all Americans live within 50 miles of a
[1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:25.160]  nuclear well let me stop you I see where you're going they're built on our coast
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:29.800]  lines 70 plus percent of our populations on the coast the feds can't show up to
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:34.800]  bring water a week and a half in at Katrina they can never help they can't
[1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:39.320]  put out fires in Texas all the feds do is show up until the locals to go into
[1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:42.920]  their command and then screw it up there's no way the feds a couple weeks
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:47.720]  into this they're gonna be gone and those things are gonna start blowing they're
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:53.520]  gonna be they're gonna start blowing now chances are that the solar storm will
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:58.720]  not screw up electronics in a small scale it'll just fry the grid so chances
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:03.880]  are that most of those backup trans backup power systems will work but
[1:29:03.880 --> 1:29:07.680]  they're only red they're only mandated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
[1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:11.840]  store one week's worth of fuel on hand so when you go out and see this most
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:15.680]  incredible light show of your life at night you said man I can't believe this
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:19.320]  you got to see this is as incredible goes on for a night maybe two maybe a week
[1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:25.040]  start the clock running you got about a week before nuclear Armageddon unless we
[1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:30.360]  fix the problem and we can fix it by the way you're a serious guy I but I've
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:34.840]  done my own research what you're saying is accurate and this is not hype and I
[1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:39.600]  can tell you're concerned I'm concerned too and I make it my job to research
[1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:45.000]  this stuff I've read it over the years but never really consciously thought
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:48.320]  about this problem let's talk about it more when we get back this is
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:55.120]  unbelievable we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:04.320]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:32:04.320 --> 1:32:08.520]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:12.800]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[1:32:12.800 --> 1:32:16.800]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:21.120]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:25.480]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[1:32:25.480 --> 1:32:29.240]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:32:29.240 --> 1:32:33.360]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:37.320]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[1:32:37.320 --> 1:32:41.160]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:43.880]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:47.320]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[1:32:47.320 --> 1:32:52.960]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[1:32:52.960 --> 1:33:04.040]  doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:34.560]  all right we're going back to our guest here in a moment he'll be with us about
[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:37.480]  five minutes in the next hour then we have our other guests joining us we'll
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:44.600]  have some calls then as well but before we go to him it's it's it's such a huge
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:49.600]  subject I just want to remind listeners that this radio show the nightly news the
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:56.320]  documentary films the news websites infowars.com prismhunter.com all of the
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:00.680]  serious information that we cover this platform is funded by you supporting our
[1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:09.400]  sponsors and buying books videos t-shirts and other materials at infowars.com
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:13.320]  and I hope that you will visit the online video bookstore I hope that you
[1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:18.640]  will purchase t-shirts like the answer to 1984 the 1776 or this new one we've got
[1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:23.320]  it has a Liberty Bell on it and it says got Liberty it's just a great way to
[1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:28.440]  meet light-minded people and it is your purchase of the books t-shirts videos and
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:32.120]  things that makes this transmission possible we're also running a new
[1:34:32.120 --> 1:34:38.800]  special that's basically similar to the New Year special the huge percentage off
[1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:43.960]  on a yearly membership it's give the gift of truth at prismplanet.tv you
[1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:47.680]  may have heard of that from Glenn Beck we we've been saying for nine years give
[1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:52.040]  the gift of truth give a prismplanet.tv membership so I said hey that's
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:55.720]  one of our old promotions from about five years ago bring back give the gift of
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:35:01.120]  truth when I saw Beck using it the point is I don't care it's fine you know the
[1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:04.880]  greatest form of flattery is imitation but we've had prismplanet.tv
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:09.800]  it'll be nine years in April and we have amazing guest film like Mr. Stein and
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:15.920]  we're truly independent and bold and we wear our political affiliations for
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:19.640]  liberty and freedom on our sleeve we don't hide it like the New York Times
[1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:23.840]  and others or Fox News saying we report you decide give me a break so hope you
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:28.360]  will visit prismplanet.tv and also become a member there all the films the
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:32.680]  nightly news everything right there it's also on Roku and a lot of other
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:37.400]  systems so check it out at prismplanet.tv we're going to the next level here now
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:40.720]  I want to go to Mark, Rob, Bev, Pappy, Richard and others will at least get to
[1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:46.640]  those calls folks in Indiana, New York, Illinois, Canada you name it but going
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:52.660]  back to our guest I read his paper and I was like wow I've seen stuff on the news
[1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:56.440]  pieces of this where they admit it and then I saw the study he was talking
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:00.200]  about where even the US government admits this is a serious danger and
[1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:04.440]  it's not like it's a possibility they know someday it might be 200 years it
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:07.760]  might be next week but I know the Sun's going into one of these wild you know
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:13.520]  100 year phases it has like 10 year 12 year phases the point is I've had Sun
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:18.120]  you know experts on I've had the physicists that and the astrophysicists
[1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:22.560]  on you know the meteorologists who have degrees in this on top of it who say
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:26.560]  the Sun's getting ready to go wild and they know this is real they know it
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:32.000]  messes up satellites everything and they know it's heated up lines that people
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.840]  are hanging their clothes on the telegraph wires were heating up red
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:40.200]  hot some of the early light systems were blowing up so with a big one
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:48.600]  hits and but what's scary going back to our guest is Homer Simpson is sitting at
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:52.160]  the helm of a lot of these we're seeing all these disasters let me ask your view
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:58.400]  on this because I can't figure it out why do you think Matthew Stein why do
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:03.080]  you think there's so many more nuclear disasters now is it we're just have
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:07.360]  better reporting or these are aging systems why do you think we're seeing
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:12.200]  so many problems already well I think a big part is aging systems you know the
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:16.920]  the high level of radioactivity is really tough on metals I mean it takes
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:22.640]  very special alloys to make the steel inside of these things and these things
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:26.520]  were originally planned for 20 year lives and now we're boosting 40 50 years
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:31.040]  and some of them so essentially we're just still they're not building new many
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:34.520]  new plants in this part of the world though they've got another couple hundred
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:38.880]  in plans for other parts of the world and so this stuff when it ages they got
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:41.960]  they don't know what to do with it there's no place to put all the stuff
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:47.120]  and and that's a big scary part is that each reactor has something called
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:50.040]  spent fuel ponds any reactor has been around a while
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:56.240]  Fukushima had 645,000 of them and they they blew for miles around yeah see they
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:00.680]  had a spent fuel pond typically has more than 10 years worth of reactor
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:05.720]  cores old reactor core stored under 20 feet of water now when you cut out the
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:12.360]  power in between a few minutes to a few hours the reactor core will melt down and
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:17.280]  start blowing its stuff when you cut out the power to cooling the spent fuel
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:21.920]  ponds depending on how recently they decommissioned the core like the if they
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:26.840]  just unloaded a reactor core it's super hot and it'll boil out that 24 feet of
[1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:33.200]  water covering those fuel rods in between 4 and 22 days so basically when
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:37.880]  the pump stop within a few hours you're blowing the reactor cores but they're
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:42.160]  contained in giant massive steel containment vessels then right next
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:46.880]  door they got this pond that basically is inside of a standard industrial tilt
[1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:51.640]  up building with a corrugated steel roof and they got 10 years worth like over
[1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:58.280]  10 cores in there in that pond and in a few days without cooling pumps the pond
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:02.720]  will be boiling down boiling down boiling down in Fukushima if it wasn't for
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:08.760]  the heroic actions on the part of the workers who flew over in helicopters and
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:12.640]  and got guns out and these guys are gonna die really early deaths a lot of them
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:15.120]  have already started to die but they always say they die of something else
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:20.880]  the Fukushima 50 right so these guys if they hadn't refilled that pond you would
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:25.640]  have seen 10 Chernobyl's going off into the atmosphere right there in Fukushima
[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:30.160]  those guys gave their lives to save us from 10 Chernobyl's see Fukushima
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:34.520]  officially has dumped half the radiation of Chernobyl but almost all of that
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:39.320]  into the ocean not the atmosphere but unofficially people say it might be two
[1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:42.760]  to five times as much as Chernobyl but again into the ocean but if that
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:47.760]  cooling pond had blown we would have seen 10 Chernobyl's worth burning
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:50.880]  directly into the atmosphere and spreading around you know what's freaking me out
[1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:56.520]  and we have best-selling author and MIT a design engineer green builder you name
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:40:01.960]  it joining us here win tech fails comms the website what's freaking me out is
[1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:06.840]  I've done all this research and everything he's saying and more is
[1:40:06.840 --> 1:40:10.480]  documented and I was just reading in Japanese news last week that they're
[1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:15.320]  they're not even taking very good care of the Fukushima 50 and their families
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:20.280]  it's this society now where the bureaucrats think that they're magic and
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:25.200]  have magical thinking and the corporations do and just say everything's
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:30.440]  going to be all right when it's not all right and radiation levels go up so I'm
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:36.080]  sure as you know mr. Stein they've just raised the level worldwide not just here
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:41.560]  to just say it's safe and as you pointed out right rotting 20 30 40 and 50 year
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:46.520]  old reactor Fukushima was like with 39 years old had three decades of waste
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:50.520]  that they weren't even shipping and out there storing it there these companies
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:54.640]  don't care place to ship it to nobody wants it there's no place to ship it to
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:58.360]  they store it on site all over the world now here's a thing so what's gonna
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:02.200]  happen what I'm saying to you though is is it all rots what is the nuclear power
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:07.480]  industry gonna do as as as these things start blowing up and melting down
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:11.320]  everywhere now almost a weekly basis I guess they're gonna just say radiation
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:15.480]  is good for us because that's the new official policy now they're just gonna
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:20.080]  they're just gonna say I'm sorry we didn't know you know why doesn't somebody
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:24.840]  make a permanent repository for all of this stuff and then you know where do
[1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:28.360]  they put you got a decommissioned nuclear reactor what do you do you encase
[1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:33.280]  they encased it in concrete in a big concrete sarcophagus at Chernobyl you
[1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:36.440]  know at least that's better than what they've done in Fukushima it's just
[1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:39.120]  still sitting there on the top of the earth and Fukushima I don't know what
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:43.920]  they're gonna do smoking it's still smoking yeah now here's the thing for
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:49.240]  about a billion dollars half the price of a self-bomber there's new technology
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:54.760]  vacuum tube giant vacuum tube technology that can switch so rapidly to protect
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:59.080]  those massive transformers from grid meltdown and so for about a billion bucks
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:03.840]  they could put those in all over the United States to protect our 350 well
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:09.080]  protect our this like 900 or something of these are you know 800 of these 350
[1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:13.320]  they protected to blow they can protect them for about billion bucks for another
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:17.800]  billion bucks they could go to every nuclear facility and mandate that we
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:23.000]  store years worth of fuel and that we have EMP hardened containers on site
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:28.520]  with backup batteries backup generators and backup fuel so that in the event
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:32.920]  that stuff gets fried by an EMP or cooked by a solar storm that at least we
[1:42:32.920 --> 1:42:36.760]  prevent nuclear arm again now I you know I'm not so naive to think that they
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:40.440]  were gonna just shut down those nuclear power plants instantly I'd love to see
[1:42:40.440 --> 1:42:44.920]  them shut down but I'm saying you know for at least for a billion bucks we
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:47.920]  could at least protect them in the meantime before we get these new
[1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:51.240]  technologies online and can just shut them down for good well Matthew I want
[1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:54.800]  to talk about the different legislation and how we hopefully get this done but
[1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:58.360]  let me just ask you because you're obviously a really smart and you know
[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:03.960]  tuned in guy from your research why do the major corporations and the ruling
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:09.920]  class obsess all day and trillions of dollars a year to fight terrorism and
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:15.480]  have spies everywhere and a new report out FBI enlist internet cafe owners the
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:19.760]  spy on customers when you literally have a better chance of dying from snake
[1:43:19.760 --> 1:43:25.280]  bite or wasp or bee sting then from a terrorist and I know that the big
[1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:28.600]  corporations make money off this and the people that are in security and
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:31.960]  government rotate and revolving doors into the private companies when I get
[1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:36.360]  their making money but doesn't the ruling class actually care about stability
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:40.120]  don't they actually care about their own behind ends because they're not immune
[1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:45.880]  from radiation why don't they care you know the thing is that ignorance is
[1:43:45.880 --> 1:43:53.240]  bliss and see the last major geomagnetic storm happened in 1921 90 years ago and
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:57.360]  it was 60 years before that so do the math the average is every 75 years and
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:01.520]  last one is 90 years ago so we're like overdue they you know looking at ice
[1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:05.320]  core samplings they say roughly every hundred years we get hit by a big daddy's
[1:44:05.320 --> 1:44:09.400]  solar storm you know what we're talking about now the thing is ignorance is
[1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:14.560]  bliss you get people like newt gingrich spouting comments about EMP which is a
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:20.600]  huge threat EMP is a real threat but the things he says are out now wrong he
[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:23.840]  takes statements that every electronic device would just instantly stop me and
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:30.440]  I say it's wrong he clearly did not read the report so if newt gingrich who's
[1:44:30.440 --> 1:44:35.080]  you know running for president of the United States acts like he's an expert
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:38.400]  but didn't even read the report that I read I took the time to read it why
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:41.480]  didn't newt if he didn't read it how many of these other guys have read it
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:45.520]  these guys are dealing with the five-minute synopsis that somebody
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:49.720]  briefed them on and they just plain don't know their attitude is everything
[1:44:49.720 --> 1:44:53.720]  gonna be fried anyway so what do we do but instead this is actually something
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:58.440]  that we could prepare for I think their attitude is they just don't believe it's
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:02.440]  that bad they somebody tells them it's not that bad and they don't read the
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:05.880]  real reports and they just you know it's like it's like like you said it's
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:09.600]  it's wishful thinking like oh everything's gonna be okay I Polly and I
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:13.480]  believe in it Santa Claus on a tooth fairy everyone the government will take
[1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:16.800]  care of me they'll come in and they'll make sure that those generators work
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:20.160]  because then nobody wants a nuclear power plant to point to melt down do they
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:25.320]  so they just believe then the good fairy that it's all gonna be okay but the
[1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:31.160]  truth is well let me go one let me go one further I tell Austinites that there
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:36.200]  are two reactors one of them is one of the biggest research reactors in the
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:41.280]  world at the University of Texas in north Austin and and grown adults laugh at
[1:45:41.280 --> 1:45:44.800]  me and say no there isn't I would have heard of it they could in 30 seconds
[1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:50.160]  pull up on the the University of Texas admitting it in fact guys type in
[1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:56.200]  University of Texas nuclear experimental reactor but but but adults won't
[1:45:56.200 --> 1:46:00.000]  even admit it's there because they might have to think about a threat I mean
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:07.120]  this is a new level of denial it is a big level of denial and the fact that we
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:12.200]  can solve the worst problem the end of the rules we know it for the price of a
[1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:17.120]  single stealth bomber I mean that's just a crime if they look look at what
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:22.000]  happened New Orleans the US Army Corps of Engineers said for 50 years that
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:26.480]  these levies were outdated and they weren't adequate and it was a disaster
[1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:30.120]  waiting to happen it's not a question of if New Orleans would get hit by a
[1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:34.480]  hurricane but when and what happened they even appropriated money for
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:38.520]  rebuilding the levies but they got spent somewhere else so they just dicked
[1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:42.120]  around and just ignored and said well they ain't broke don't fix it you know
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:45.440]  it's okay everything will be all right and we lost most of New Orleans well
[1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:49.240]  now we're talking about losing the world as we know it we're talking about
[1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:54.360]  perhaps the extension of all human beings on the planet for something that
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:59.360]  can be solved prevented for the price of a single stealth bomber I mean it's
[1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:03.320]  criminal and that's one of the reasons I'm wrote this article I mean I've been
[1:47:03.320 --> 1:47:08.240]  talking to the world's top scientists on this nuclear scientists EMP scientists
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:12.480]  military guys people who know about this stuff the guy John Kaepernan who wrote
[1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:18.000]  the the giant report from Meditech on geomagnetic influences storms and the
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:22.240]  and the effect on the US grid I've been talking hours on these phone with these
[1:47:22.240 --> 1:47:25.320]  guys and they've been begging me to write this article and to get on your
[1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:29.040]  show and to get on all these shows and they're saying you know Matt we've been
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:34.160]  singing this song for a long time and they agree 100% with me about the 400
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:38.400]  Chernobyl's they agree and they're saying Matt you got to get it out to the
[1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:41.640]  public because we've been singing it but you know we're scientists and we're
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:45.920]  engineers and we don't we don't get on public radio and you know we don't write
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:49.560]  these articles like you do for the for the common man you know we write
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:54.240]  technical journals articles so that they've been begging me to get on your
[1:47:54.240 --> 1:47:57.320]  shows like yours and get this out to the public because we can solve this
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:03.440]  problem we can do it well I'm glad I saw your report I'm glad we linked to it
[1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:11.960]  info wars.com because you are not putting a exaggerated spin on this I mean
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:16.480]  the only sane response to this is to have a debate and discussion but every
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:19.960]  movie I rent and everywhere I go it's just terrorists are gonna kill you
[1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:23.320]  terrorists are gonna kill you give up your rights and obviously it's an excuse
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:26.640]  to take our liberties whether the terrorists are real or not but
[1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:33.880]  meanwhile this this system is just so hubris filled that that they just think
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:38.600]  it can't happen here and I have top engineering genetic engineers on you
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:42.520]  name it I've got the government's own reports where the GMO within three
[1:48:42.520 --> 1:48:47.920]  generations is sterilizing all the guinea pigs and rats and they're just
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:51.600]  letting us eat it we see our health problems exploding I mean it's on every
[1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:56.200]  front it's like it's like humans have been given all this technology and we're
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:01.120]  still acting like like apes or something with it and just killing each other you
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:05.640]  know Europe said no they looked at the data and said wait a minute we're not
[1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:11.240]  gonna take your GMO they said no and in this country Monsanto had their pot
[1:49:11.240 --> 1:49:14.960]  hands in the pockets of both the Republicans and the Democrats they got
[1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:18.200]  their hands in the government and they got it run right through there's no
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:24.400]  drug in the world that would get approved if it had data like the data on GMO I
[1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:29.760]  mean and this is this is something where there's people running for profit and
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:35.080]  they just don't give a damn about the health of the world and the future of
[1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:40.320]  the world and the people it's like profit in greed is number one and and I you
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:43.880]  know but what is it profit you've you make two billion dollars and then your
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:49.520]  grandkids die of cancer short-term profit you've made the money now you live
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:54.160]  the life now and well your grandkids you know that somebody else's problem
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:59.160]  I don't understand it I mean it's not me I mean I wrote my book when technology
[1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:03.160]  fails and I borrowed on my house and I you know you had all the equity in my
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:07.280]  home and three years of my life in that and and more into when disaster strikes
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:12.320]  and I wrote these books to help people cope with these coming times of change
[1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:16.680]  and disaster in our world where you've got to be more self-reliant you've got
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:20.320]  to be prepared you got to take your own health in your own hands because the
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:24.320]  government is not watching out for you and if you're gonna wait and rely on
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:27.640]  the doctors to provide you with antibiotics when there's the next
[1:50:27.640 --> 1:50:31.960]  antibiotic superbug coming along you're you know you're in trouble so I wrote
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:35.920]  these books to help people no no they're incredible times of change they're
[1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:38.360]  I've read one of them I'm gonna read the other and I'm gonna try to carry them
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:41.680]  in infowars.com they're powerful we got two short segments left we're gonna go
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:45.840]  right to calls in question but I gotta tell you I mr. Stein I look forward to
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:49.640]  having you back up for a full two-hour interview and then air fuses we can go
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:54.080]  over everything you're covering in these books it's just amazing information
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:58.360]  we're trying to save lives here trying to save our planet trying to save our
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:03.280]  futures this is big deal we'll be right back a little over a year ago I began to
[1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:07.360]  do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:11.680]  still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the
[1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:14.920]  soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[1:51:14.920 --> 1:51:19.200]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[1:51:19.200 --> 1:51:24.240]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:29.160]  off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral
[1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:33.480]  company out there and discovered young Jevity the young Jevity products are

[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:10.680]  from MIT is telling us best-selling author Matthew Stein you look at the
[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:17.960]  data and the data is GMO is killing us already and within three generations as
[1:54:17.960 --> 1:54:22.960]  every 20 years to get up to breeding capacity on average devastation serious
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:26.200]  problems every mammal species they've tested on but they don't test it on
[1:54:26.200 --> 1:54:31.520]  humans I want to go to some of your calls here but then you look at the the
[1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:37.320]  reactors and the solar flares and you look at everything else the system's
[1:54:37.320 --> 1:54:42.080]  doing it really is just a bunch of crooks snatching and grabbing everything
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:48.120]  and then thinking of police states gonna protect them and we see this kind of
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:53.960]  megalomania with Hitler we saw it with Nero we saw it with the Aztecs and by the
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:57.480]  time a couple hundred Spanish showed up and defeated tens of thousands of Aztecs
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:55:01.720]  it was because the society had already collapsed but now it's a collapsed
[1:55:01.720 --> 1:55:08.400]  society with crazy leaders running things we've got nuclear weapons and all
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:11.720]  of this it's just insane and I look forward to having our guests on for a
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:16.000]  full two hours soon let's go to Mark in New York you're on with our guests go
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:22.840]  ahead Mark hello Alex Southwestern New York calling Chuck Harder I'm sure you're
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:27.720]  familiar with the name is up on this and is trying to develop a system that
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:36.000]  would possibly help the average homeowner deal with anything but an E3 level
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:43.800]  pulse he was on with Joyce Riley a few months ago talking about this EMP that's
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:49.480]  slated for about a year from now well let me ask our guests that question can
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:56.640]  they predict what an EMP is gonna hit generally no but they do know that we
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:01.960]  have a solar maximum it's 11 every 11 years the Sun's poles flip and that's
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:08.280]  when it burps the most but any even in a solar minimum a giant storm a big burp
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:11.920]  from the Sun could happen a big CME could launch towards the planet just as
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:16.800]  bad as 1921 so it's really kind of a crap shot in the role of a die what they
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:21.720]  do know is that we're it looks like we're quite active in this period heading
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:26.360]  up to the next solar maximum so there's a decent chance now if we're lucky we'll
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:32.480]  get a blow like South Africa 2003 that fried 14 transformers and they'll be
[1:56:32.480 --> 1:56:35.720]  enough to screw things up and really scare people enough to really fix the
[1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:41.600]  problem if we're unlucky we get in 1921 or 1859 or even worse kind of storm and
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:46.000]  and it's game over at least for societies is in the world as you know it
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:51.520]  color what was your other quick question silicon chips versus transistors I
[1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:57.520]  wanted to mention that the silicon icy chip obviously is affected but the
[1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:03.280]  transistor that is that that's carbon right is that correct no transistor is
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:11.160]  silicon it actually turns out now here's the thing in a solar storm you don't
[1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:17.720]  have the short-term superfast nanosecond effect that fries chips you have the
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:23.280]  the long slow burn which is called the e3 the e1 is like an EMP effect from a
[1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:27.720]  nuke going off and the e1 is what fries chips now it turns out that all of the
[1:57:27.720 --> 1:57:32.120]  chips made most of the chips made in the last five years to the EU standard have
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:37.680]  built-in electrostatic protection and so most of those will survive the e1 so
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:42.880]  the latest electronics but it what's the bigger concern see people say I'm I'm
[1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:46.840]  more concerned about a terrorist EMP attack or a solar storm I'm much more
[1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:51.280]  concerned about the solar storm than the EMP attack EMP attack is bad it could
[1:57:51.280 --> 1:57:54.760]  collapse the country it could collapse the stock market could and probably shut
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:58.640]  down Washington DC for a long period of time but at least the rest of the world
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:02.640]  would still be there to come in and fix and maybe some nukes would go off
[1:58:02.640 --> 1:58:06.800]  because of the EMP primarily probably in the east coast because that'd be the
[1:58:06.800 --> 1:58:10.840]  primary target but it wouldn't be a 400 Chernobyl's end of the world as we know
[1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:15.680]  it's seen but the solar storm you're talking most of the world's grid cooked
[1:58:15.680 --> 1:58:22.220]  most of the world's 442 reactors melting down and the storm is a slow cook
[1:58:22.220 --> 1:58:27.680]  right because he's keeps coming in coming in heating things up right cook so
[1:58:27.680 --> 1:58:32.480]  the same e3 of an EMP is like a solar storm only it's over most of the planet
[1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:38.320]  instead of a 1,500 mile circle or a 500 mile circle for a small well stay there
[1:58:38.320 --> 1:58:46.680]  quick questions back in one minute you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm
[1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:55.720]  today hi folks this is Alex Jones don't want to tell you about the silver lungs

[2:00:04.760 --> 2:00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.520 --> 2:00:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.040 --> 2:00:24.560]  Alex Jones all right we only got five minutes we're gonna have to ever guess
[2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:27.760]  back but I want to just get a quick question from each caller so be ready
[2:00:27.760 --> 2:00:30.920]  throw it out we'll get a quick answer does I want to hear from everybody robin
[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:35.880]  Illinois you're on the air with our guests go ahead gentlemen thank you so
[2:00:35.880 --> 2:00:40.400]  much for your info go ahead I live in Oxford outside of Byron Illinois and we
[2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:43.880]  just kind of had a little incident with our nuclear plant I was just wondering
[2:00:43.880 --> 2:00:47.680]  what the public could do one of some of the simpler things that we could do to
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:52.000]  prepare a case there is have it well I mean yeah I mean it every week it's
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:56.080]  Illinois it's California and radiation alerts and they released it and they say
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:01:00.480]  don't worry about it so I mean what do you do to prepare I would try to not live
[2:01:00.480 --> 2:01:05.920]  close to one but they've got so many your comments on that Mr. Stein okay I
[2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:11.080]  have I can't go detailed into the strategies but in the last chapter my
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:16.280]  book is in called when disaster strikes the last chapter is the unthinkable
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:21.040]  surviving a nuclear catastrophe there's three separate strategies depending on
[2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:27.320]  if it's a nuclear plant meltdown a dirty bomb or an actual nuclear like bomb
[2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:31.920]  going off some somebody launched a bomb at us different strategies but the thing
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:36.320]  you want to do right now is I take motor fillin every day which is a seaweed
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:41.760]  extract that keelates to heavy metals it's mercury's lead and also radioactive
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:45.440]  heavy metals so I'm just probably gonna take that the rest of my life provided I
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:48.600]  have access to there's already so much heavy metal in the environment you need
[2:01:48.600 --> 2:01:53.000]  it anyways well and the radioactivity comes to you in heavy metal and it's
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:57.800]  concentrated in the food chain when you eat eggs and milk and in meat products
[2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:01.920]  you know those though they're every time you go up a level in the food chain is
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:06.320]  more concentrated so you want to start purging that stuff from your body so you
[2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:10.640]  don't end up with a Chernobyl necklace in 20 years where you got thyroid cancer
[2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:15.040]  or you get some plutonium lodged in your lung and you got lung cancer so so
[2:02:15.040 --> 2:02:20.040]  that I hope I've answered absolutely sir a great point I totally agree with that
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:24.480]  I've started the seaweed for the last year really give me a lot of energy let's
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:30.000]  go to a bin in Indiana then you're on the air go ahead thanks guys I was
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:35.200]  basically gonna ask the same types of questions what can we do to one prepare
[2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:41.040]  our home and obviously I understand taking the seaweed I think the big thing
[2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:46.320]  is warn people politically so that we can force movement by corporations and
[2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:50.720]  government for self-preservation I think that's what Ben said you know the last
[2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:56.200]  or this caller was bringing up mr. Stein yeah you want to work on your
[2:02:56.200 --> 2:03:00.920]  personal level your preparedness your ability to understand the situation when
[2:03:00.920 --> 2:03:04.480]  it's chaotic to figure out what's going on so you can do the right strategy to
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:08.200]  have the materials on hand ahead of time to for yourself reliance you want to
[2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:13.520]  work on a community level this is the the transition community transition town
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:18.200]  which is towns to become more resilient and more self-reliance so they can deal
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:21.880]  with changes in energy and that's happening everywhere as in a lot of
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:25.520]  highly educated people have been moving to the countryside and you find these
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:31.960]  communities all over the place Papi in Illinois quick question for our guest go
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:40.600]  ahead Papi I want to stay mobile how do I make my garage a fair day cage go well
[2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:45.600]  yeah you know you don't need a lot of metal to be a fair day cage and but the
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:50.320]  thing is that the EMP test show unless it's a super optimized like super EMP
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:54.200]  weapon if your car is not running at the time of an EMP meaning it's in your
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:03:58.960]  garage if chances are 99 out of 100 it's going to be fine the problem is the
[2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:02.760]  grid is going to collapse not that your car is not going to work now if you want
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:07.440]  to be really sure about EMPs you can take garbage cans and throw electronic
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:11.640]  devices in garbage cans if you want to be really sure you do a double a double
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:15.560]  fair day cage where you take your device put a garbage bag around it wrap it
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:18.600]  aluminum foil put another garbage bag around it and then stuff some of those
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:22.720]  in it galvanized garbage can and that will be but everybody again is worried
[2:04:22.720 --> 2:04:27.640]  about themselves personally the grid folks is what is super long wires and
[2:04:27.640 --> 2:04:32.680]  is what's going to pick up and intensify this and that's where you're
[2:04:32.680 --> 2:04:37.280]  gonna have the problem and it's not just the grid it's any digital control
[2:04:37.280 --> 2:04:42.120]  system that runs all of our factories pollution plants power plants refineries
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:46.760]  everything they have massive runs of of ethernet wire that connects all the
[2:04:46.760 --> 2:04:51.240]  devices together that stuff cooks in an EMP most of your personal electronics in
[2:04:51.240 --> 2:04:55.640]  your home turns out will be okay it's the infrastructure that's the problem it's
[2:04:55.640 --> 2:04:59.200]  the infrastructure great job sir look forward to having you back soon another
[2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:04.560]  powerful gas coming up hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:09.560]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as they're
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:13.400]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:17.560]  Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president in
[2:05:17.560 --> 2:05:22.640]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of
[2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:27.680]  us as American citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the
[2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:32.360]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[2:05:32.360 --> 2:05:36.000]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:39.960]  Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[2:05:39.960 --> 2:05:43.640]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does
[2:05:43.640 --> 2:05:49.680]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get

[2:08:05.880 --> 2:08:10.560]  because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:23.080]  well I can't think of a more intense subject than geomagnetic storms EMP and
[2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:29.100]  nuclear armageddon and that's basically what the federal government's own
[2:08:29.100 --> 2:08:35.000]  studies say could happen if a big storm solar storm like we've seen the last
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:40.560]  hundred or so years hits with all these wires we've got strung up it's just
[2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:47.080]  just amazing to to see all of this going on but don't worry desert news
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:52.720]  reports UN leaders consider world tax to fund social protection services but to
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:58.720]  protect people from the UN forces themselves is that's what's going to
[2:08:58.720 --> 2:09:05.200]  happen her memo came in with this story that is an info wars com right now FBI
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:10.120]  enlist internet cafe owners to spy on customers and they you already know
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:14.600]  about the hot dog seller people turning on the spies at the football games and
[2:09:14.600 --> 2:09:18.600]  this is at all the football games I mean again my dad who's a dentist has been
[2:09:18.600 --> 2:09:22.820]  approached to spy on his patients which is of course a violation of the
[2:09:22.820 --> 2:09:27.240]  Hippocratic oath even if they don't have you give that anymore and he thought it
[2:09:27.240 --> 2:09:29.440]  was just him and talked to other dentists and this happened to everybody
[2:09:29.440 --> 2:09:32.960]  and of course it's in the news they're doing that everyone's a spy and the
[2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:38.320]  message is trust no one but government and then a lot of people kind of feel
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:42.480]  like they've been promoted you mean Homeland Security wants me as a person
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:49.520]  selling you a Coca-Cola and a hot dog to what he's supposed to do like well
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:53.640]  there's a big line you're like I'd like a hot dog and a bottle of water and some
[2:09:53.640 --> 2:09:57.160]  and a popcorn oh really where you going what you doing I mean because that's
[2:09:57.160 --> 2:10:00.400]  what they do now when you check it at a hotel we're gonna rent car or a bank
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:06.320]  account and it's Homeland Security Patriot Act compliance and it's on
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:10.440]  record and and so when someone's just asked me 20 questions I'm like I don't
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:14.160]  have a criminal record and you're sitting there asking me these questions I'm
[2:10:14.160 --> 2:10:18.520]  checking in at your hotel I'm getting this rental car this is all part of
[2:10:18.520 --> 2:10:24.520]  destroying our society and they start going oh really it is and where are you
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:28.480]  there in town oh you there's not a reason you don't want to tell me is there
[2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:32.280]  I'm like I don't know tell me about I've actually done this tell me what you had
[2:10:32.280 --> 2:10:36.520]  for lunch today tell me about you how do I know you aren't doing something wrong
[2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:42.440]  a lot of people at work at hotels rob people's rooms how do I know you're not
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:45.560]  a criminal I want to talk to your manager that's always oh we're sorry oh
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:49.400]  oh you mean I'm not just gonna roll over and cower to you like what a cop pulls
[2:10:49.400 --> 2:10:54.520]  me over what's in the car what's in that glass of water mind if I look at it you
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:11:03.000]  can see it right there and I'm like how about I come search your car oh I know
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:07.800]  it's ridiculous I'm the one under suspicion I'm the bad man I get it I'm
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:14.280]  guilty until proven slave I'm guilty until I'm bullied into totally being your
[2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:19.160]  minion I'm here to be taught I'm the little man you're the big man I'm here
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:25.480]  to live in a third-world country I got it I don't know if you got it I mean I've
[2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:30.840]  watched TSA myself I watch videos on the news walking up to people bugging their
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:38.160]  eyes out acting tough as they like grab on some old woman's body parts and he's
[2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:44.040]  just like how could you do this all day but it's people who have crushed little
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:51.560]  egos and it's the feeling of power I mean I've run into this over the years not
[2:11:51.560 --> 2:11:55.920]  not now we got nothing the great people but you know managers and things that
[2:11:55.920 --> 2:12:00.800]  they're managing people and then they start getting on a power trip and just
[2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:04.400]  messing with people for no reason and it's just you just see people with power
[2:12:04.400 --> 2:12:15.440]  going to their heads and big government gives people that window that venue that
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:24.560]  opportunity and so that's why there's this mass hoax everywhere that terrorists
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:30.480]  are hiding in your closet that they're behind the trash can outside and it's
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:35.600]  similar to the movie jaws when the first jaws came out this has been widely
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:40.040]  reported they saw record numbers of people not getting in the water at
[2:12:40.040 --> 2:12:49.040]  beaches and even less numbers of people at at beaches they saw people afraid to
[2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:53.280]  go in the water and I mean I can't tell you how many times I've been there with
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:13:00.280]  family and I'm like that been in the Caribbean I'm like let's swim the 800
[2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:08.320]  yards from this peninsula some cases more than 800 yards maybe one way one
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:14.160]  time we swim about there's probably a mile and a half just to get there and it
[2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:19.760]  was to a big shipwreck we'd seen driving in on the island of Roatan there was a
[2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:23.560]  modern shipwreck like I've been there about 50 years or so the part of the
[2:13:23.560 --> 2:13:27.760]  ship was still up and I said it was a river coming out that's exactly where
[2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:31.320]  you do see sharks I was wanting to see some you know 99% of the time they're
[2:13:31.320 --> 2:13:34.880]  not gonna bother you I mean you walk around in downtown with big buses and
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:39.120]  cars going by that kills you know hundreds of thousands millions globally
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:44.000]  every year and you're not like oh my gosh a Lincoln you know town car I guess if
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:48.040]  you painted like big teeth on it it would be scary I mean I've drive down you
[2:13:48.040 --> 2:13:51.960]  know country roads with cars going 70 miles an hour every day six inches from
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:56.560]  my car they'll 18 wheelers will come over sometimes and if I didn't pull over on
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:00.920]  the shoulder a little bit they they'd kill me I'm going 65 they're going 65
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:07.000]  that'd be 130 mile an hour accident we'd all be dead but I just drive down
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:13.960]  that road so people like you with nothing but goggles and in fact we
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:18.520]  rent this resort with people laying around the beach and most of them go out
[2:14:18.520 --> 2:14:21.640]  more than about a hundred yards to swim around see some of the coral and stuff
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:26.640]  and go out underneath the bridge and I'm like my parents were with me and my
[2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:29.040]  wife's with the kids so we're gonna be gone a couple hours that cool yeah we're
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:32.440]  built Zangazzles and when I came back they had some of the staff couldn't
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:40.240]  believe we swam across the river and it was a big wide river and then out to
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:45.760]  this point to see all that and they're like aren't you afraid of sharks I
[2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:52.880]  mean it's this world where people are just paralyzed with fake fear with
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:15:01.600]  illegitimate not based in reality irrational fear I mean if I would have
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:08.480]  seen a tiger shark which might eat two people a year worldwide it would have
[2:15:08.480 --> 2:15:14.960]  been amazing if I would have I mean cows kill hundreds of people a year one
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:18.440]  almost killed my uncle when he was working on a big ranch because he was
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:22.120]  putting a do you know tag in the caps here and black angels aren't supposed
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:26.000]  to be that mean but stomped him pretty bad knock most his teeth out but my dad
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:33.080]  got him back in him the vet I worked for at right after graduation had almost
[2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:37.120]  been killed when he got his degree from A&M and then in the hospital I think
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:40.720]  something like six months with his guts literally stomped out by a cow I mean
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:44.240]  cows kill hundreds of people guys type in number of people killed each year by
[2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:52.880]  cows it's got to be very high but the point is you have me getting you eaten
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:56.920]  by shark yeah let's show Chris one of the producers being eaten by a shark we
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:16:00.200]  were showing statistically only a few people get eaten by sharks totally year
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:05.960]  and that and that you know the terrorism is a overblown threat so our shark
[2:16:05.960 --> 2:16:11.920]  attacks that's one in three million seven hundred and forty eight that you be
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:17.640]  killed by a shark and is that over that's got to be even lower though
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:22.680]  because there's like there's like seven billion people and you've only got on
[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:28.160]  average on average what five shark deaths a year on average and of course
[2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:31.880]  there's you like fifty something get bit pretty bad but I mean you know they
[2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:36.960]  can't now that's just the US you okay so you have a one and three million
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:41.720]  something chance but I mean and most the shark attacks are a little you know five
[2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:46.240]  foot black tip you step on it or it thinks your foot's a fish and pow you
[2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:51.760]  hit you on the toe what is it that's so scary there is this archetypal image in
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:57.320]  our minds of things with big black eyes one-way eyes and sharp teeth it's a
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:03.600]  monster and it's fun to get scared of it it is it is so much fun to be
[2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:09.320]  absolutely paralyzed I mean I remember we were in Belize one time just about
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:13.240]  four years ago and we were you know on one of those trips where they take a
[2:17:13.240 --> 2:17:17.720]  boat out and you just snorkel because at the time why even get tanks if you're
[2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:22.200]  only in 20 feet of water 15 feet of water and this big beautiful nurse shark
[2:17:22.200 --> 2:17:26.000]  comes up gigantic I mean I didn't even know they got up to like 10 feet and it
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:30.320]  was black with gray spots all over it everyone goes they're all these
[2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:33.720]  pelicans eating they were feeding the fish or all these stingrays and everybody's
[2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:38.480]  like running on the boat and my wife and I are still sitting there while the
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:41.880]  shark goes around and the people on the boat like no they're right it's not a
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:45.320]  dangerous shark we're leaving in 10 minutes anyways but a few people got
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:49.320]  back in with the nurse shark you know there it is headline dangerous cows in
[2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:54.160]  New York Times how many say cows kill I know it's got to be a lot because I
[2:17:54.160 --> 2:18:03.080]  know people that have had family killed by cows how many is it saying 21 cases in
[2:18:03.080 --> 2:18:08.080]  which people were killed by cows that's not as much as I thought from oh three
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:15.720]  to seven in Iowa Kansas Missouri Nebraska I know a lot of folks get hurt
[2:18:15.720 --> 2:18:22.480]  by cows and there were other cases where were cows fell on people accidentally
[2:18:22.480 --> 2:18:26.680]  they're claiming very trendy all right listen our guests did not show up but
[2:18:26.680 --> 2:18:30.120]  that is no big deal because I want to go to your phone calls and that happens
[2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:33.960]  sometimes time zone issues I was gonna get him on about collapsing economies in
[2:18:33.960 --> 2:18:37.440]  the internet under attack but I want to go to your phone calls anyways for
[2:18:37.440 --> 2:18:44.760]  Richard Steve Patrick Sean Tara and others will get to all of you after this
[2:18:44.760 --> 2:18:48.920]  break and I've sort of kind of digressed here and if you're a new
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:54.760]  listener and you think I'm being macho saying that I'll swim a mile and a half
[2:18:54.760 --> 2:19:04.160]  you know only 500 yards from shore out to a wreck with a snorkel and fins
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:08.720]  that's that's not cuz I'm macho or I'm tough that's because you've been to
[2:19:08.720 --> 2:19:14.120]  become domesticated and that's nothing so I suggest you start taking some more
[2:19:14.120 --> 2:19:18.560]  risk and stop being so scared of everything because that's how they they
[2:19:18.560 --> 2:19:22.640]  turn us into a nation of cowards who are totally afraid of sharks and because
[2:19:22.640 --> 2:19:26.800]  it's an archetypal image it's propaganda and it's the same thing with
[2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:31.880]  terrorist okay you got a better chance being killed by a cow than you do by a
[2:19:31.880 --> 2:19:38.000]  terrorist and you need to understand that and that that isn't real in Hollywood
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.440]  all the terror attacks and and all that stuff and I know you know that
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:45.800]  consciously but subconsciously people are afraid that's why they say I'll give
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:50.480]  up all my rights and let people grab my genitals at the airport to keep me safe
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:55.560]  from something that is about as real as leprechauns all right we'll be right back

[2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:50.640]  latest on Iran some very important news concerning China and also some good news
[2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:55.920]  Senate to vote on bill that could kick TSA out of airports that's at prison
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:25:01.320]  planet dot com but right now let's go to Richard in Canada thank you for holding
[2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:06.840]  Richard thank you very much blessings from Canada I'm just wondering if a
[2:25:06.840 --> 2:25:11.800]  nuclear reactor could be looked at like a false flag like the idea of what's
[2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:16.000]  going on in the Strait of vermouth with that old battleship that they have
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.160]  there you know the idea that they would blow it up and then blame it on
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:22.360]  somebody else well yeah they've got a they've got an aging aircraft carrier
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:27.560]  that's set to be decommissioned in December and that's the one they have
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:32.160]  cruising back and forth in front of the Iranians begging them to shoot at it so
[2:25:32.160 --> 2:25:37.120]  that is clearly a false flag because they could you get into a shooting match
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:40.800]  easily we know Cheney wanted to attack one of our ships and women on the
[2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:46.840]  Iranians Pulitzer Prize winner Sy Hirsch has documented that we have all
[2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:51.400]  the other pieces of evidence there but yes the globalist could blow up a reactor
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:54.720]  and say that terrorists had done it I mean they're endangering our whole
[2:25:54.720 --> 2:25:58.640]  society right now in so many other ways they don't care they're a bunch of
[2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:03.640]  ruthless people who know no bounds who think they're God full of Hutzpah and
[2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:09.120]  arrogance and bravada who think they're bulletproof and don't care about the
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:13.040]  future and a lot of globalist I've got some of their quotes in in-game my film
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:17.520]  they make statements about oh well if we do destroy the earth you know trying to
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:20.840]  get immortality and trying to discover the secrets of the earth that's just the
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:25.480]  way it is so it's it's like you're not even in their club unless you want to
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:30.120]  dally with destroying the earth a little hint the special 30 minute
[2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:36.080]  documentary I'm producing that is going to air at the Dallas event of the 19th
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:41.120]  of this month and at the event in Orlando Florida the 26th on that Sunday
[2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:44.240]  I'm gonna give it like an hour and a half speech 30 minutes a question and
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:48.800]  answer and then premiere this special film it deals with the real ways the
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:51.800]  globalist are threatening to destroy the planet you know it covers the real
[2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:56.040]  threats to humanity and of course the speech is about blueprints to defeat the
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:26:59.320]  New World Order people can find out about that at info wars.com
[2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:03.680]  forward slash events the tickets are going fast for Dallas and Orlando if
[2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:07.680]  people want to be part of that anything else sir I was also going to mention
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:13.560]  along those lines that Newt Gingrich was on the television mentioning that
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:19.440]  after his second term as president to that they will have the the space station
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:22.760]  on the moon completely up and running and I'm just you know it's like he's
[2:27:22.760 --> 2:27:26.480]  trying to tell us something through that statement yeah why are we gonna have a
[2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:31.080]  space station on the moon when we can't even protect our power grid and again
[2:27:31.080 --> 2:27:36.400]  90 plus percent they say 80 was more like 90 of the space program secret
[2:27:36.400 --> 2:27:41.120]  there's rockets blasting off but that's old technology that's 1920s
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:45.640]  Verner von Braun technology you know the the Saturn rocket was a 1930s design the
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:49.640]  space shuttle was a 30s design that Verner von Braun drew Hitler wanted a
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:56.200]  space shuttle but heavy lifters is old it's big giant space planes that take
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:02.000]  off like planes and land like planes and they've got 30 plus years of secret
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:06.240]  tech on that that's pretty much admitted and so Lord knows what they've
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:10.320]  already got in space there is a giant secret space program I don't think you
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:15.280]  can speculate exactly to what's going on because folks I've talked to who do
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:19.360]  know a little bit about that because they were the heads of NASA programs head
[2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:25.880]  of you know cameras on the moon head of RCA programs in that area heads of I've
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:29.760]  talked to the former head of the Star Wars program Dr. Bob Bowman Colonel
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:35.240]  Bowman and they will not talk about it but they can point you in directions of
[2:28:35.240 --> 2:28:40.400]  things that have been leaked but there is a by the late 70s there was already a
[2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:47.920]  stealth robot spaceplane drone fleet in in orbit that's the 1970s we're not in
[2:28:47.920 --> 2:28:54.720]  Kansas anymore Bubba would appear so we're not one one quick thing what is
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:29:00.960]  your opinion of I think her name is Mary Marine Le Pen in France I don't know
[2:29:00.960 --> 2:29:05.720]  enough about her to endorse everything she's doing but she's nationalistic
[2:29:05.720 --> 2:29:10.920]  moderately kind of like a pet Buchanan I know a lot about her dad I know Bob
[2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:14.480]  Chapman who lived there for a while says he knows the pins well and he never
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:18.600]  seen Bob lie and he says she's he knew where she was a little girl he says
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:22.440]  she's a wonderful woman so I think that's a pretty good endorsement right there
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:28.280]  what do you think I heard about her through the Bob Chapman and I got I
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:31.000]  heard about him through you and then I went and started listening to as much
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:35.080]  as I could about his and he he endorsed her quite a bit so I'm just a
[2:29:35.080 --> 2:29:38.480]  researching her and I think it's a good thing that there's at least there's
[2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:42.040]  somebody else out there like Ron Paul you know because the here in Canada the
[2:29:42.040 --> 2:29:46.240]  only the closest thing we had was Jack Leighton and he kind of died so we're
[2:29:46.240 --> 2:29:49.680]  we're set him on our own here but Liberty's growing some more leaders will

[2:32:05.440 --> 2:32:09.240]  had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to
[2:32:09.240 --> 2:32:13.400]  a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[2:32:13.400 --> 2:32:16.840]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:21.600]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[2:33:46.260 --> 2:33:49.240]  quickly through your calls before I hit more news before we end the shower I
[2:33:49.240 --> 2:33:52.760]  got a lot of important stuff I haven't gotten to yet there's stacks of it here
[2:33:52.760 --> 2:34:00.120]  let's go to Steve and Vermont you're on the air thanks for holding good
[2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:06.680]  broadcasting worldwide my friend absolutely I had one of the state that I
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:10.760]  guess the question Vermont Yankee power plant is according to a report that I
[2:34:10.760 --> 2:34:14.920]  saw one of the worst and I guess fastest decaying nuclear power plants in the
[2:34:14.920 --> 2:34:20.960]  country and during behind the occupied movement we had a construction going on
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:25.280]  by the Greenmount power company trying to build wind turbines and there were
[2:34:25.280 --> 2:34:30.320]  people trying to get close and I guess to get to where they're trying to to blow
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:33.840]  stuff up so they couldn't set the explosives off to build the wind
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:38.040]  turbines and I was just wondering why a power plant that is in such poor shape
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:43.960]  gets so little national attention because it's a conspiracy theory the
[2:34:43.960 --> 2:34:48.480]  plant doesn't even exist I mean that's here in Austin they say the reactors in
[2:34:48.480 --> 2:34:52.600]  Austin just do not exist there's a media policy that if you talk about it
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:56.160]  you're laughed at even though you can just type in nuclear reactor University of
[2:34:56.160 --> 2:35:02.040]  Texas there it is the photos video they're quite proud of how big it is and
[2:35:02.040 --> 2:35:05.640]  it's the same thing it's this new delusional thing where isotopes are
[2:35:05.640 --> 2:35:09.800]  several hundred times what they should be okay we'll just raise them a thousand
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:15.920]  times what's safe oh well this isotopes you know so deadly you know it's 80
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:19.400]  something thousand times what it should be we'll just raise it 100,000 times say
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:25.280]  it's safe and they just wave a trendy wand and they go trendy government but
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:29.040]  then they say take over farmers ranch for the earth everybody's like take it
[2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:33.120]  take it carbon dioxide humans breathe is evil I mean literally you're like
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:38.000]  that's mindless they're like shut up extremist so you know GMOs killing you
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:42.640]  and they're like shut up extremists so so anything that isn't a threat like
[2:35:42.640 --> 2:35:48.040]  terrorists or carbon dioxide they run in fear literally flopping around pulling
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:51.880]  their hair out and gnashing their teeth and just shaking and begging for a pot
[2:35:51.880 --> 2:35:56.640]  bellied person from the TSA to grab their their body parts or humiliate their
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:00.800]  their wife and children or to be put them in a microwave oven and body scan them
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:06.920]  and lie to them and say it's not dangerous but yes rotting 35 40 45 some
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:11.440]  are almost 50 years old nuclear waste all stored there rotting from the
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:15.320]  radiation and now they're just setting the precedent to say it's safe and they
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:19.480]  just flip a switch and release radiation and you're gonna hear about it now not
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:23.560]  on a weekly basis but daily now they're like oh radiation alarms well since
[2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:27.400]  those scared people we're just getting rid of them now down in Southern
[2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:31.000]  California they're going you know what maybe we just won't turn alarms on when
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:34.880]  it's scared people when we release radiation and it's not bad for you
[2:36:34.880 --> 2:36:39.960]  anymore DU wasn't allowed to be used until 1990 it said it's totally deadly
[2:36:39.960 --> 2:36:44.280]  they'll kill you but now they just like to use it and the young men after a tour
[2:36:44.280 --> 2:36:48.200]  or so have blood coming out their nose to form children they're dying they're in
[2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:52.520]  wheelchairs they're on life support they go in pine boxes in the ground the
[2:36:52.520 --> 2:36:56.240]  family all stands around as I've seen it on the news they just stand around and
[2:36:56.240 --> 2:37:00.440]  give the give the the preacher says you know Billy fought Elcott and everybody
[2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:05.000]  cries and no one asked why I died of lung cancer nobody asked why I died of
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:09.360]  kidney failure from the DU they just they just get old patriotic and pet
[2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:13.200]  pillman dad fought in Elcott as well even though the government missed they
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:16.920]  killed him you know it's just it's just all part of a trendiness does that answer
[2:37:16.920 --> 2:37:22.440]  your question it's all about training us sir I mean really I guess I think what
[2:37:22.440 --> 2:37:25.760]  what we're fighting up here is what a lot of people call NIMBYism not in my
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:29.480]  backyard and it's just strange to me that people would would rather have a
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:36.480]  rotting nuclear reactor in their backyard than a few wind turbines well I
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:40.640]  hear you brother I hear you but again you're a conspiracy theorist if you're
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:44.600]  worried about what's admitted to be one of the oldest most rotting out of spec
[2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:49.360]  out of code reactors look I'm a shorn allowed to build barns now because it's
[2:37:49.360 --> 2:37:53.280]  bad for the earth but if you want to have a 45 year old reactor leak and
[2:37:53.280 --> 2:37:56.880]  radiation it's fine don't be an extremist you understand sir oh
[2:37:56.880 --> 2:38:01.200]  absolutely I mean there's been tons of leaks and yeah if you know I've been
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:06.520]  called paranoid from just about no no no no no you're bad you're bad sir now now
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:10.240]  if you wanted to tax humans for breathing because carbon dioxide so deadly
[2:38:10.240 --> 2:38:15.760]  so you're carbon dioxide that plants breathe is bad radiation that kills us
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:19.520]  is good do you understand that you're starting to figure this out now
[2:38:19.520 --> 2:38:24.000]  oh absolutely yeah good wait for a long time long-time listener all right God
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:28.240]  bless you I'm glad you met your bad Patrick in a middle sarcastic here
[2:38:28.240 --> 2:38:31.720]  because it's so absurd what's happening Patrick in New York you're on the air
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:38.160]  you've got some rotting nuclear power plants up there as well so no um hey
[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:43.000]  Alex Jones great to be on the show um I wanted to tell you about some deceptive
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:48.720]  information I've been coming across on the internet one is 11 bad habits for
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:55.720]  kids teeth it seems to me that it's just a sugar-coated guide for poor
[2:38:55.720 --> 2:39:00.800]  psychological development like it has on middle of the night breastfeeding it
[2:39:00.800 --> 2:39:05.000]  kind of demonizes breastfeeding a bit oh breastfeeding is completely unnatural
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:12.800]  sir whoa whoa we got another extremist I'm sure you the associated press says
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:16.680]  it's reasonable that five-year-olds are arrested for running on the playground
[2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:22.200]  running is evil just as evil as breastfeeding let me let me tell you I've
[2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:25.320]  predicted because the globalists say they want to make things totally unnatural
[2:39:25.320 --> 2:39:29.360]  break up the family if they had their way in 50 to 100 years it would be an
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:34.560]  arrestable thought crime to say that women or any mammals ever breastfeed
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:39.240]  they're young and I'm not being sarcastic and see right there you're
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:43.080]  saying that that I mean they're already what they're reporting breast I mean I
[2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:48.600]  saw an article last week all over the news pregnancy is dangerous get
[2:39:48.600 --> 2:39:53.400]  abortions and they actually said pregnancy is almost unnatural it's
[2:39:53.400 --> 2:39:57.320]  it's archaic and just just have an abortion it's three times safer guys
[2:39:57.320 --> 2:40:02.280]  pull it up abortion safer than birth so pretty soon it's don't breastfeed that's
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:07.680]  al-qaeda give all your rights up for non-existing terrorists so so so so so who
[2:40:07.680 --> 2:40:13.520]  puts up the who put out the 11 things that are bad for your snappers um I
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:18.240]  originally found it on AOL news they finally find it on this everyday health
[2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:23.520]  website um I can't find an author sir are you saying that babies are supposed
[2:40:23.520 --> 2:40:27.760]  to breastfeed every three hours I mean I guess my wife was wrong to get up when
[2:40:27.760 --> 2:40:32.640]  the babies cried and breastfeed them man I'm so extra they're gonna probably
[2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:39.040]  call child welfare on us you mean you mean I was wrong AOL says the oh man
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:44.680]  whoa whoa extremist extremist right now I'm sorry it's we're so radical I'm
[2:40:44.680 --> 2:40:51.760]  sorry go ahead and also I also came across on this website the Illuminati
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:57.520]  flash like a minus sign in between the an Illuminati net and it's basically
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:02.000]  them saying everything we say except saying they're the good guys kind of
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:06.560]  well that's I mean that that's always standard branding I appreciate your call
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:12.000]  I think I may have even seen that before there are thousands of websites that say
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:18.960]  we're the good guys but everybody else is an agent and oh there it is Reuters
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:25.560]  abortion safer than giving birth like you're not and now they're saying maybe
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:28.840]  it's abusive to have babies maybe you should know I'm we're not sure what
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:35.320]  this means but should you be allowed to get pregnant and it could be abusive but
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:39.600]  going back what you're saying that's a standard deal some of it's coming tell
[2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:42.440]  pro I don't know about individual sites you're talking about you know
[2:41:42.440 --> 2:41:47.280]  specifically but Cass Sunstein talks about cognitive dissidents operating
[2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:51.080]  imposing as anti-establishment anti-corruption a conspiracy theorist
[2:41:51.080 --> 2:41:57.320]  someone who goes no breastfeeding is good children have always breastfed that's
[2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:01.720]  why we develop mammary glands and it's it's it's natural you mean you see the
[2:42:01.720 --> 2:42:05.520]  war on breastfeeding women totally cover themselves up at the mall there's all
[2:42:05.520 --> 2:42:10.680]  these scantily clad women everywhere that's fine you know kiosk with women
[2:42:10.680 --> 2:42:17.760]  in G-strings selling you know negligee's half-naked women on billboards women
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:22.120]  flashing their breasts at the Super Bowl flipping people off all of that's okay
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:29.040]  but I I've actually seen in restaurants and other places you read about the news
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:34.840]  all the time where where a woman is breastfeeding at the table at the
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:38.720]  restaurant all you do is put a blanket over boom no big deal and people act like
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:43.360]  it's bad because it's like they've been programmed that life is evil and a woman
[2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:49.880]  with a baby there's just something wrong it's drinking milk oh it's gross they've
[2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:53.920]  lost their life force I mean you should be happy to see a woman nursing a baby
[2:42:53.920 --> 2:42:58.280]  that's like the tribe is doing good there's babies we're living but but but
[2:42:58.280 --> 2:43:04.960]  anything that's wholesome is bad everything evil is good but Cass Sunstein and others
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:08.000]  you know they say sunshine is a good for you you should arrest anybody that's a
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:11.800]  conspiracy theorist they're criticizing electric cars shut down their websites
[2:43:11.800 --> 2:43:16.240]  I mean they're all calling for it right now because they're craziness people are
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:21.280]  finally waking up out of the trance but I do see this almost everyone we've
[2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:27.880]  ever helped you know sold books for videos for supported promoted there's
[2:43:27.880 --> 2:43:33.760]  almost no one that I had ever had on the show supported promoted that doesn't
[2:43:33.760 --> 2:43:41.040]  down the road start attacking us because somehow they think that is a one-up and
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:47.360]  like elevates them it's like a primitive idea that if somebody could shoot me
[2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:53.240]  down that would make them more successful or by creating in fighting that
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:59.360]  that's the kind of attention they want we never in fight here and we never talk
[2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:04.840]  about folks even if we think they're operatives until we can absolutely prove
[2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:09.080]  it now in the case of Hal Turner who was attacking myself almost every day I'm a
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:12.480]  big white supremacist I could tell he was a Fed just by watching him and
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:16.000]  listening it was a hundred percent obvious and I called him out I said that
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  guy's a Fed and his website did get hacked people got his emails where he was
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:24.680]  a high-level national security agent asset for the FBI and the National
[2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:29.480]  Security Council so the feds went ahead and put him in prison and it came out in
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:33.840]  federal court he was an FBI highest level asset but the state court still
[2:44:33.840 --> 2:44:38.000]  convicted me and he went to jail so that shows you what the feds do their own
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:41.720]  people I mean occasionally if it's so super obvious I'll do it but but I mean
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:47.640]  I've had people just completely make up stuff before you know Alex Jones called
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:51.320]  me up and threatened to kill me and that's like saying I called up and said
[2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:56.120]  I'm the Jolly Green Giant from Pluto I mean just my soul said Alex Jones called
[2:44:56.120 --> 2:45:01.960]  up and told me he was an Easter Bunny or a Kibler elf or or or or the egg man or
[2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:08.640]  the walrus cuckoo cuckoo you know just but but lies that are so bold so big and
[2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:13.000]  it's done because I'm number one I mean that's why all the different media
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:17.400]  outlets attack drudge because he's number one when it comes to media online
[2:45:17.400 --> 2:45:23.720]  we're number one when it comes to to patriot movement liberty you know even
[2:45:23.720 --> 2:45:27.960]  time magazine got it right and call me the the the the what was the quote the
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:34.720]  the prophet of the tea party oh I am the prophet of the tea party Ron Paul is
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:38.160]  the grandfather of the tea party and then we're told you're not welcome at tea
[2:45:38.160 --> 2:45:42.240]  party events you know Ron Paul signs aren't welcome we're gonna stomp on your
[2:45:42.240 --> 2:45:48.720]  feet you know we're we're the new neocon tea party we we you know we took over the
[2:45:48.720 --> 2:45:53.120]  old tea party and now the real people aren't invited see I don't try to get up
[2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:56.920]  here and toot my horn I give you reports on we're reaching 15 million people a
[2:45:56.920 --> 2:46:01.440]  week and growing exponentially I give you reports on successes we're having but
[2:46:01.440 --> 2:46:07.320]  others are happening we're here explaining we can win and evil isn't in total
[2:46:07.320 --> 2:46:13.920]  control and evil isn't all powerful and not everybody fighting evil is a
[2:46:13.920 --> 2:46:19.320]  government operative in fact very few are you understand that this idea you
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:24.640]  always know government operatives because they'll operate for a year never
[2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:28.760]  generally longer and then to do nothing but in fight and then just kind of fade
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:32.800]  away and you hear about I'm getting a PR job or whatever you know with some
[2:46:32.800 --> 2:46:37.720]  globalist operation it's always the same MO and you know people bring stuff up
[2:46:37.720 --> 2:46:42.880]  like that because it's so tantalizing to get into a soap opera of personalities
[2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:48.760]  I don't ever do that and that's one reason I've been so successful it never
[2:46:48.760 --> 2:46:52.600]  hurts me to be attacked especially about people I don't know in fact I
[2:46:52.600 --> 2:46:56.640]  relish it and it's kind of a sin it's entertaining the wilder the lies the
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:47:04.640]  better but it as I've tried to be spiritually you know better and not
[2:47:04.640 --> 2:47:10.280]  get off on you know sick little entertainments I have I've given up even
[2:47:10.280 --> 2:47:13.560]  tracking or watching people say about me I mean I never really tracked it
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:17.120]  closely but if it fell in my lap I would have a little bit of enjoyment you know
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:22.800]  out of it and in a way people attacking us and lying about us also got the word
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:27.480]  out about us I mean only made us bigger so I'm thankful and appreciate that God
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:31.640]  turns every weapon formed against us into something positive no weapon formed
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:34.360]  against us will prosper I want to go back to your calls this is an important
[2:47:34.360 --> 2:47:39.600]  subject so hardly ever talk about it as the jealousy level just intensifies and
[2:47:39.600 --> 2:47:42.880]  gets greater and greater you got operatives you got this info agency
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:47.480]  got to go and tell pro but mainly it's not even that and then that's what's sad
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:55.480]  about it is that it is absolute complete abject jealousy and and I'm
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:48:00.800]  genuinely worried about the superfluous and about the airborne Ebola they've
[2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:04.560]  cooked up that kills over 90% of the mammals that comes in contact with I'm
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:07.520]  really worried about that getting out and all these government labs where
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:12.560]  they're breeding it I'm genuinely worried about a big solar storm knocking
[2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:16.160]  out power grids and reactors melting down and so is the government so in
[2:48:16.160 --> 2:48:20.080]  internal reports that we were discovering last hour I'm genuinely worried
[2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:26.800]  about all that I'm not worried about you know looking the best or my or how
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:33.800]  fancy things are or going to award ceremonies or my ego I am more into a
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:39.960]  genetic ego of human race surviving and going to the stars and pride in my
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:44.640]  species and optimism and love of science and love of honor and goodness and
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:49.560]  decency and I'm quite frankly more ashamed of myself because I am aware of
[2:48:49.560 --> 2:48:53.880]  the higher things I'm also aware of the lower things and can see that my
[2:48:53.880 --> 2:48:58.380]  greatest works are like dirty rags they are they're dirty rags and then I see
[2:48:58.380 --> 2:49:02.920]  people wearing equally or even more dirty rags squatting in their own
[2:49:02.920 --> 2:49:10.240]  spiritual excrement a proud like peacocks strutting around fighting with
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:17.680]  each other and it hurts me because they're so spiritually blind that's
[2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:23.440]  how I am hurt by things and I've made myself give up on sins I have like the
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:27.960]  enjoyment of being attacked now not in a sadomasochistic way it's not like that
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:32.360]  it's like it's funny watching the jealousy seeing people burning in
[2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:36.960]  jealousy and knowing I'm superior I'm more intelligent I'm more effective I'm
[2:49:36.960 --> 2:49:44.760]  more dynamic I have more zeitgeist lightning in my soul it's sad that the
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:48.360]  people recognize that and instead of upping their game and getting closer
[2:49:48.360 --> 2:49:53.240]  to God and creation and resonating with the universe that they're such dim
[2:49:53.240 --> 2:49:59.280]  lights and it's sad I should try to pick them up and I realize a lot of times
[2:49:59.280 --> 2:50:04.800]  it's when I try to build somebody up and they get a taste of success it there
[2:50:04.800 --> 2:50:07.840]  it's not that they wanted to be successful to fight evil they wanted to
[2:50:07.840 --> 2:50:12.240]  be successful to be little movie stars and so then they see then they hate the
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:16.840]  person that that tried to give them a hand up because you're helping someone
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:23.840]  who is fighting for breath who's going under the waves who's a drowning man a
[2:50:23.840 --> 2:50:29.760]  drowning woman and so you can't help them they don't know how to swim they're
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:35.240]  never going to know how to swim there they're probably never going to make
[2:50:35.240 --> 2:50:39.600]  it they're probably never going to truly live so you're there trying to lift
[2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:43.280]  them up and instead they're just trying to get on top of you and shove you
[2:50:43.280 --> 2:50:46.200]  under and then after you're under the they're going to go back under the
[2:50:46.200 --> 2:50:50.040]  water they just know that they've got to get you under there because you're
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:54.000]  there down here and you're up here and they'd be okay if you were down here you
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:57.600]  got to just move on from people like that and find those that do want to learn
[2:50:57.600 --> 2:51:02.880]  how to swim that's who's gonna build the future you don't need me to tell you
[2:51:02.880 --> 2:51:08.400]  that humanity is in a deep crisis everyone can feel it we know a tectonic
[2:51:08.400 --> 2:51:13.240]  struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love
[2:51:13.240 --> 2:51:20.280]  darkness bondage and enslavement yes my friends evil is rising but take heart

[2:54:22.040 --> 2:54:26.020]  be a new type of humanoid of course they've already done this with monkeys
[2:54:26.020 --> 2:54:30.560]  apes and humans they just kill them at the embryotic level and they say it'll
[2:54:30.560 --> 2:54:35.200]  eradicate diseases see in the future by law if you have any predisposed
[2:54:35.200 --> 2:54:38.000]  conditions they're not going to let you have a kid and they're going to come in
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:43.200]  and tell you we're going to go in and inject some other DNA from from someone
[2:54:43.200 --> 2:54:46.840]  else to cover that up of course Lord knows whether problems it'll cause this
[2:54:46.840 --> 2:54:50.720]  is the type of out of control new world order stuff that's going on and there's
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:54:55.120]  the headline there if you're watching on prison planet TV so this is all going
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:58.440]  to become mandatory everything's got to be done in a test tube that's why the
[2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:02.120]  breastfeeding is evil you know half the women are getting these caesareans when
[2:55:02.120 --> 2:55:06.040]  they when the doctors know they don't need them it's about medicalizing
[2:55:06.040 --> 2:55:14.360]  everything taking over monopolizing Tara in Virginia you're on the air
[2:55:14.560 --> 2:55:22.000]  can you hear me sure can welcome oh thank you I wanted to make a request and
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:29.120]  make a couple of comments for some websites are and YouTube channels that
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:34.240]  might be helpful for listeners to get information about different things
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:39.440]  regarding in the direction of nuclear fallout that sort of thing number one
[2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:48.200]  with your you know the music that you use in between your your sex years that
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:52.920]  you your clips that you have between between your different sections can you
[2:55:52.920 --> 2:55:58.000]  do you think you could make a underneath your daily show would you make like a
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:06.440]  list of what you've used so that we could find it and buy it buy it from itunes
[2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:14.720]  if we want to double my show I'll come out the music list sure sure well let's
[2:56:14.720 --> 2:56:17.840]  just bumper music those are just short clips but you can pretty much get the
[2:56:17.840 --> 2:56:23.040]  Kazaa program on an iPhone and then hold it up to whatever the song is and
[2:56:23.040 --> 2:56:28.040]  it'll tell you what it is but that is a good idea you actually have there as
[2:56:28.040 --> 2:56:34.520]  for YouTube and and websites about nuclear fallout there's a ton of free
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:38.120]  information about how to protect yourself during fallout but but we're not
[2:56:38.120 --> 2:56:41.840]  talking about how to protect ourselves individually after this happens we're
[2:56:41.840 --> 2:56:46.280]  trying to stop it from happening they need to build more clean burning cold
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:50.360]  plants or whatever or stop shutting off our pipelines or allow alternative
[2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:54.280]  energy to be developed not the fake green stuff that the establishment pushes
[2:56:54.280 --> 2:56:58.720]  that's about mega companies the system should be promoting individual off the
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:05.360]  grid for each home which is very cost effective but they try to block it show
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:09.800]  that we are not all dependent on massive grids that if they fail could knock
[2:57:09.800 --> 2:57:16.120]  civilization back a hundred years and and and cause serious problems we're
[2:57:16.120 --> 2:57:20.720]  discussing how to head off these problems before they get here I appreciate
