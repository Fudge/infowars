[00:00.000 --> 00:28.840]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling
[00:28.840 --> 00:37.720]  oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude. People can be made to enjoy
[00:37.720 --> 00:43.640]  a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy.
[00:43.640 --> 00:51.680]  I have sure better start from the beginning. I have sure better start from the beginning.
[00:51.680 --> 01:05.560]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse. A lot of these kids come from bad gene
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.160]  pools. They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:11.160 --> 01:16.080]  Rookery containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.840]  Pediatric. These new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives may actually
[01:20.840 --> 01:24.080]  be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:24.080 --> 01:29.000]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could it also cause cancer?
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.760]  For example, the government had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on
[01:33.760 --> 01:36.160]  the American public under a specific condition.
[01:36.160 --> 01:40.640]  I have to work the dark side while I spend time in the shadows.
[01:40.640 --> 01:46.040]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil. Well, join me. I'm
[01:46.040 --> 01:53.240]  glad to sit here at the White Hand to see. There's a need for new world order. Someday,
[01:53.240 --> 02:21.040]  in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:23.240 --> 02:46.560]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday, June 11 transmission. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:46.560 --> 02:51.720]  And it's all official. And it's one thing to know it's coming, but it's another thing
[02:51.720 --> 02:58.920]  when it hits you. From Australia to Pakistan to the United States, all across the world,
[02:58.920 --> 03:04.200]  they are officially saying that they're going to inject children without the parental authorization
[03:04.200 --> 03:10.640]  and that they are closing city parks in every globalist controlled city, so you know the
[03:10.640 --> 03:18.480]  globalists are in control, where you cannot go to the park to play basketball or to listen
[03:18.480 --> 03:27.200]  to a free concert or anything unless you have been injected with the poison shot. And for
[03:27.200 --> 03:34.240]  now, they have a PCR test that's totally fraudulent, where they stick it up your nose and then put
[03:34.240 --> 03:39.000]  you in a database. And of course, they're really getting DNA samples, which is their
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.360]  larger plan. And that's all come out as well. I mean, this is a criminal takeover. And on
[03:44.360 --> 03:53.040]  a rigor scale, it's a 10. And you turn on the flame on high and they put the water on,
[03:53.040 --> 03:59.000]  but it's on high. It's going to get to boil now very, very quick. They've got the flame
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.080]  turned all the way up. I mean, this is biblical stuff and it's all admitted and over 100 corporations
[04:05.080 --> 04:11.920]  came out headed up by Google and Apple and called for climate lockdowns. And it's all
[04:11.920 --> 04:17.960]  being directed by this Fortune 100 group that controls the Davos group in the UN. And this
[04:17.960 --> 04:26.680]  is corporate governance. I was talking to a high level executive last weekend. And she's
[04:26.680 --> 04:33.160]  an executive at a major oil company. And she's basically one of the highest level women there.
[04:33.160 --> 04:39.160]  And she was telling me about what they did to them and how they were locked down and
[04:39.160 --> 04:43.600]  how if they were caught leaving their house, the petroleum company would fire them. And
[04:43.600 --> 04:47.840]  then that just goes downhill. It was all the corporations that locked down first, you see.
[04:47.840 --> 04:52.520]  Well, Goldman Sachs is saying basically, if you don't have the injections, you can't
[04:52.520 --> 04:57.280]  work there. So that's where all this is going. And then we know that the injections are causing
[04:57.280 --> 05:02.320]  death and sterilization. I've been thinking a lot lately about playing
[05:02.320 --> 05:07.440]  devil's advocate on there about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist
[05:07.440 --> 05:10.920]  that the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future
[05:10.920 --> 05:14.720]  from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve
[05:14.720 --> 05:19.680]  to be killed. Yes, that's the position of the globalist. They play God. And they think
[05:19.680 --> 05:25.880]  because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us. And I've told you that the
[05:25.880 --> 05:29.320]  globalists have tried to harm me. They've tried to get me to join them. But metaphysically
[05:29.320 --> 05:35.120]  at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit. I'm connection with God. And I know that God
[05:35.120 --> 05:40.440]  does not like that. So I cannot join the enemy. But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get
[05:40.440 --> 05:44.520]  very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it or
[05:44.520 --> 05:48.960]  believing you're getting power on it. Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher
[05:48.960 --> 05:55.240]  or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God. And treating other people like they're animals
[05:55.240 --> 06:09.040]  and you're God is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like. And that's
[06:09.040 --> 06:13.040]  a fact.
[06:13.040 --> 06:23.040]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:23.040 --> 06:49.120]  You got me. You got me new world order in your grip. But I'm going to get out of your
[06:49.120 --> 06:57.240]  grip. Thanks for joining us on the Friday Transmission as we broadcast worldwide. For
[06:57.240 --> 07:02.120]  TV viewers, we put back up on screen what we were just looking at, the disgusting puppets
[07:02.120 --> 07:10.080]  of the New World Order, the G7. Every single one of them stole their way into office. Every
[07:10.080 --> 07:15.080]  single one of them says they want to be a dictator. Every single one of them is owned
[07:15.080 --> 07:21.400]  by the New World Order. Those are the puppets of the Davos group, the UN and the big corporations
[07:21.400 --> 07:28.400]  above them, Miracle and Johnson and McCron and all of them. So when you look at those
[07:28.400 --> 07:39.280]  sacks of garbage out there, like Biden and Trudeau, remember, those are your enemies,
[07:39.280 --> 07:47.640]  but they are still just captains, figureheads for the global government. They are the plague.
[07:47.640 --> 07:55.040]  They are the traitor. They are the enemy. And they will end up in the ash heap of history.
[07:55.040 --> 08:04.200]  Let's say a prayer that God bring justice upon them. Vigil's mind say at the Lord, they
[08:04.200 --> 08:09.560]  are terrorists. They are the people carrying out the worldwide medical tyranny against
[08:09.560 --> 08:19.880]  us. Well, here we are on this June 11th, Friday broadcast. And we have got a lot to cover here
[08:19.880 --> 08:28.000]  today. What's the big news? What's the big headline? It's official. A medical ID worldwide
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.520]  mark of the beast is publicly being rolled out all over the globe. And anywhere the IMF
[08:33.520 --> 08:39.240]  and World Bank have control of your country through debt. Forced inoculations or your
[08:39.240 --> 08:45.000]  phone is turned off. Next, your children are taken from you under UN directive. Here it
[08:45.000 --> 08:54.080]  is, RT, New York Times, all of them. No jab, no phone. Unvaccinated to have SIM cards blocked
[08:54.080 --> 09:02.080]  Pakistan's Punjab government says. That's the next level of the control. Oh, but you're
[09:02.080 --> 09:08.440]  like, well, that's Pakistan, the test city. Australia is now announcing similar programs
[09:08.440 --> 09:14.200]  and it gets worse. Greece is as well. Spain, the U.K. are all announcing pilot programs
[09:14.200 --> 09:21.600]  and it gets worse. In New York state and New York City, run by the communist mayor and
[09:21.600 --> 09:29.520]  globalist governor, we have the video. People trying to go to the public park where the
[09:29.520 --> 09:36.320]  symphony has played for over a hundred years, free to the public, culture to the public.
[09:36.320 --> 09:44.360]  You can't get in unless you've had the injection that's causing so many serious health issues,
[09:44.360 --> 09:48.320]  not as a side effect as the main effect. It doesn't protect you from the cold virus.
[09:48.320 --> 09:52.040]  It makes your body attack itself. I mean, they're really doing it. They always said
[09:52.040 --> 09:56.760]  they were. They tested it here, tested there, killed millions of people, but they've been
[09:56.760 --> 10:01.120]  in Pakistan, in India, in areas of Africa, in Latin America, giving people poison and
[10:01.120 --> 10:14.120]  ovulations for a long, long, long time. But now they are making their move to force all
[10:14.120 --> 10:19.280]  of us into this. And this is war. I don't want to have physical confrontations. I don't
[10:19.280 --> 10:24.120]  want to lead a physical confrontation. I'm not wanting to be put in a super max prison
[10:24.120 --> 10:33.640]  or killed. And I've already done a lot. My work is getting the news out to warn others
[10:33.640 --> 10:40.640]  to organize against this. But you have to understand that it is an act of violence to try to forcibly
[10:40.640 --> 10:46.480]  inoculate people with something that was pushed by Bill Gates and the globalists who say they
[10:46.480 --> 10:55.600]  want to depopulate us. And a pharmacist that destroyed, or just let them spoil, a few thousand
[10:55.600 --> 11:03.320]  vials of poison, he was just sentenced to three years in prison. In fact, reprinted that article
[11:03.320 --> 11:09.600]  for me to get to it. Thank you. I mean, that individual deserves a medal. In fact, when
[11:09.600 --> 11:13.840]  that person gets out of prison, I hope we're still on air, and I hope you still have the
[11:13.840 --> 11:19.920]  money to be on air. They've got a job here because they're a better man than me, putting
[11:19.920 --> 11:26.560]  their money where their mouth was. And that's where we are. I mean, if you were in Nazi
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.320]  Germany and you knew that bullets were going to be used at a death camp to shoot innocent
[11:31.320 --> 11:37.560]  people in the head, or cyclone B gas, would someone be a hero for spoiling the cyclone
[11:37.560 --> 11:42.080]  B gas or throwing away the bullets? Well, no, in Nazi Germany, you'd get sent to prison
[11:42.080 --> 11:49.160]  for that or kill. But that's what this is. And this is how they always do it in Pakistan.
[11:49.160 --> 11:54.280]  They always do this in India. I saw a British psychological warfare report that was actually
[11:54.280 --> 11:59.840]  in a psychology journal, or the more scholarly ones, that I just picked up at Barnes and
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.280]  Noble like 15 years ago and read it. And it was just in a tactic I already noticed myself
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.720]  didn't need to read the psychological warfare manual. But it was an example of the British
[12:08.720 --> 12:14.320]  saying, well, in one operation, we killed about 15,000 people in Kenya, mowed them down
[12:14.320 --> 12:23.560]  with machine guns, tanks and helicopters. And what we had was a British MI6 report.
[12:23.560 --> 12:28.520]  We just announced seven were killed by our troops. That one, when people hear thousands
[12:28.520 --> 12:34.960]  later, it averages it down and the person remembers the lower number and psychologically
[12:34.960 --> 12:40.280]  doesn't believe the larger true number. And so I told you a year ago when this vaccine
[12:40.280 --> 12:44.360]  comes out, the so-called vaccine, and remember, everything's a lie. It's not a vaccine. It's
[12:44.360 --> 12:51.880]  a gene therapy injection. Very deadly. When that happens, they'll say, oh, rare cases
[12:51.880 --> 12:55.880]  of death, rare cases of heart attack, rare cases of blood clot, rare cases of the lungs
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.160]  disintegrating, rare cases of being paralyzed, rare cases of narcolepsy, rare cases of epilepsy,
[13:01.160 --> 13:07.600]  rare cases of type 1 diabetes setting in because it causes a lot of these things causing auto
[13:07.600 --> 13:11.280]  immune response in the pancreas for whatever reason. And that's even in the literature of
[13:11.280 --> 13:16.520]  most vaccines it says can give you pancreatitis in the type 1 diabetes. And I had a family
[13:16.520 --> 13:19.960]  friend that his daughter was in great shape and got a vaccine, had pancreatitis and got
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.400]  sick and then was now type 1 diabetic. So this is an ecstatic total. Everyone I know
[13:25.400 --> 13:33.640]  has been damaged, my mother, my friends, family. And so that's why they announced emergency
[13:33.640 --> 13:41.560]  meeting at the FDA over rare blood clots and heart attacks and in the young taking the
[13:41.560 --> 13:46.440]  Moderna and the Pfizer injections. Well, that's what happened in Europe. That's why it got
[13:46.440 --> 13:50.360]  banned all over the world. That's why China won't take it. Remember, when you walk up
[13:50.360 --> 13:53.200]  to the park and they say you can't come in unless you've had this injection and they
[13:53.200 --> 13:59.520]  look at you like you're an idiot. Remember, it's this stuff banned all over the world.
[13:59.520 --> 14:03.600]  You've got medical doctors coming out saying we're seeing a tenfold increase in our patients
[14:03.600 --> 14:10.320]  that are regular patients with their prostate saying they have cancer. Because the body
[14:10.320 --> 14:17.640]  is acting like it's being, it's having bad tissues grow. Well, they admit, oh, your uterus
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.080]  is going to swell up and your lymph nodes are going to swell up and they're going to
[14:21.080 --> 14:25.440]  tell you it's cancer. Well, when people go in now, they're telling them I have family
[14:25.440 --> 14:30.200]  and I've talked to medical doctors that they're doing massive numbers of cancer surgeries
[14:30.200 --> 14:34.000]  now on people that took the vaccine. Then the news is like, oh, just tell your doctor
[14:34.000 --> 14:42.880]  you have the shot. Well, they go test it. Most of these are not non-aggressive cancers.
[14:42.880 --> 14:50.720]  They are malignant. And so this is a cocktail of death, cocktail of total death. And we
[14:50.720 --> 14:58.760]  come back, I'll play the clip of New York City. Absolutely incredibly out raging. And
[14:58.760 --> 15:05.360]  people need to demonstrate, they need to protest against this. They need to say, no, because
[15:05.360 --> 15:11.640]  this is bullying, this is organized crime, this is totally illegal. And how do you make
[15:11.640 --> 15:19.640]  somebody take a PCR test to go into the supposedly free event? I mean, this is just all an act
[15:19.640 --> 15:24.080]  of total submission. And of course, they're still wearing their mask and still engaged
[15:24.080 --> 15:29.000]  in all their fear mongering. And the left saying they want to wear their mask forever.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.800]  This is a real cult. This is a real dystopia. Imagine if I said in the future of the New
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.520]  World Order, you won't just have a poisonous injection to be able to have a job or go to
[15:36.520 --> 15:41.640]  places where everyone's wearing masks and pedophiles or having storytime with your children.
[15:41.640 --> 15:45.960]  It's only going to get crazier from here on out. World government, mark of the beast,
[15:45.960 --> 15:51.440]  satanism, and then huge wars break out and these robots slaughtering people everywhere.
[15:51.440 --> 16:02.200]  I mean, it's going to be hell. Get ready. It's all going to unfold now.
[16:02.200 --> 16:08.320]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[16:08.320 --> 16:13.320]  the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And
[16:13.320 --> 16:18.320]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.840]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[17:00.040 --> 17:06.720]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[17:06.720 --> 17:13.120]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs. Companies
[17:13.120 --> 17:19.640]  began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs. The natural sources were then
[17:19.640 --> 17:25.400]  made illegal. Pharmaceuticals became medicine. And the sicker people got, the more their
[17:25.400 --> 17:31.160]  industry grew. It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape. Good health
[17:31.160 --> 17:37.480]  begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive. Nutrients

[19:22.560 --> 19:42.400]  I'm going to hurt myself on air. And I'm not into hurting myself. I'll hurt myself real
[19:42.400 --> 19:48.280]  bad if I need to stop bad people. But I'm not going to hurt myself real bad. In fact,
[19:48.280 --> 19:52.720]  they'll tell you it's no big deal. But if they take the bait like they usually do, they'll
[19:52.720 --> 19:57.400]  say Jones is self-harming on air and all this stuff. But you see, when I stick this needle
[19:57.400 --> 20:01.720]  in my arm, it's not going to have anything in it. It's not going to hurt me. My body's
[20:01.720 --> 20:10.120]  going to heal itself. You know, my immune system, my skin, my cells. But when there's
[20:10.120 --> 20:18.200]  a secret compound developed, and we learned later, secretly tested on animals and humans
[20:18.200 --> 20:22.400]  that actually sterilizes people and causes blood clots all over their body, that's a
[20:22.400 --> 20:27.240]  big deal. And if I came at you with that, saying you have to do this to have your job,
[20:27.240 --> 20:32.800]  that's slavery, that's medical tyranny. And then if you got sick and died from it, I basically
[20:32.800 --> 20:39.480]  murdered you. But you see, then it's all okay, isn't it? Because we all collectively made
[20:39.480 --> 20:44.640]  the decision. And I liken it to something that happened in every culture. And the Globalist
[20:44.640 --> 20:48.600]  of Studies of Human Psychology, and the UN talked about this, and I break it down in
[20:48.600 --> 20:53.960]  my film Endgame, and in the Extras to Endgame, that they said, we want to bring back tribalism.
[20:53.960 --> 20:57.040]  We want to dumb down the general public. We want to get rid of knowledge while they're
[20:57.040 --> 21:02.760]  basically getting rid of math now, even advanced prep schools are getting rid of advanced math.
[21:02.760 --> 21:08.960]  We want a bunch of superstitious, dumb animals that we can then just call out. And by the
[21:08.960 --> 21:14.840]  time we get rid of humanity, we would have brought back human sacrifice. That's an official
[21:14.840 --> 21:23.960]  UN biological diversity plan from 1966 that I learned about from Dr. Michael Kaufman, who's
[21:23.960 --> 21:31.240]  now with his creator. Very blessed to not have to be with us right now, knowing all
[21:31.240 --> 21:38.560]  this was coming. But the point is, is that we'd read what was in those UN documents,
[21:38.560 --> 21:42.440]  but he had to go to the UN archives in New York to even find the stuff was not online,
[21:42.440 --> 21:47.120]  but it was the big official UN books, and he had color copy scans of the stuff. And
[21:47.120 --> 21:52.040]  then, you know, we covered that. And even though I was reading that the UN document,
[21:52.040 --> 22:00.680]  it was fantastical, even in 2007, when I was making that movie. But this is beyond that.
[22:00.680 --> 22:08.440]  And so here it is, no jab, no phone, unvaccinated to have SIM cards, block Pakistan's Punjab
[22:08.440 --> 22:15.080]  government says. Punjab government decides to block SIM cards of people refusing vaccines.
[22:15.080 --> 22:20.440]  I mean, this is not a science fiction horror movie. This is reality. COVID-19 pandemic,
[22:20.440 --> 22:28.800]  Chile's capital locks down despite mass vaccination, BBC. So you got some secret shot causing all
[22:28.800 --> 22:32.520]  these illnesses, all these deaths, world governments pushing, people that want to depopulate you
[22:32.520 --> 22:43.800]  are pushing, you can't get into the park now to a public park for a public event. You can
[22:43.800 --> 22:49.080]  take the shot, or you can show us your evidence of that, or you can do a PCR test, we get
[22:49.080 --> 22:53.240]  your name, put it in the database, some contact tracers come after you. This is the beginning
[22:53.240 --> 22:57.520]  of the Clinton Foundation and the UN's global initiative with the contact tracers that there
[22:57.520 --> 23:01.200]  are going to be 10 million in the US. They've already got 2 million ready with giant state
[23:01.200 --> 23:06.120]  contracts and federal contracts making billions of dollars for people to do all this. It's
[23:06.120 --> 23:14.080]  the new economy, little handheld robot testers, the size of a credit card machine that people
[23:14.080 --> 23:18.080]  stick things up your nose and just get you used to people in your bodies doing what they
[23:18.080 --> 23:27.840]  want raping you. Hi, body, Bill Gates' choice. So they, with the COVID shots, they use a
[23:27.840 --> 23:32.280]  bigger needle than even an insulin needle. I was thinking about doing this a few weeks
[23:32.280 --> 23:35.840]  ago as a stunt, so I had them go out and get me some needles from a local pharmacy where
[23:35.840 --> 23:39.920]  they're actually injecting people with this poison. This is just an empty one, but people
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.760]  don't think of what's in it, they seem to think of the size of the needle. So if you've
[23:44.760 --> 23:49.560]  got a little insulin needle, people are not that scared of it, even though you could put
[23:49.560 --> 23:59.000]  a tiny bit of cyanide in this and you could inject somebody and it would kill them in
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.680]  a matter of minutes. So see, it isn't the size of the needle that counts, it's what's
[24:03.680 --> 24:09.720]  in the needle. So again, letting a government globalist system force you to put something
[24:09.720 --> 24:14.880]  in your body, that's not shocking, but it will be shocking when Alex Jones puts a needle
[24:14.880 --> 24:18.880]  in his arm and he's insane, he needs to be locked up. Just like I prefaced, I'm going
[24:18.880 --> 24:22.360]  to do a rant on eating my neighbors if society collapses because the third world is already
[24:22.360 --> 24:30.360]  starving to death and dying. And so we're murdering them and so what comes around goes
[24:30.360 --> 24:34.880]  around once society collapses here, when things revert to cannibalism, does it the left know
[24:34.880 --> 24:38.680]  they're going to basically get eaten? And that's a metaphor, but in some cases it'll
[24:38.680 --> 24:43.680]  actually happen. Comprende? So see, to me, it's not crazy to stick an
[24:43.680 --> 24:49.160]  needle in my arm to illustrate this to you and to save a lot of lives for people to research
[24:49.160 --> 24:54.000]  what's actually in these deadly shots. But see, it's all in context. I'm just a man,
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.440]  an average guy, an evil white man hurting myself, but when the big corporations tell
[24:58.440 --> 25:03.480]  you you're going to do this or we're not going to let you have a job or go to the park or
[25:03.480 --> 25:07.800]  any of that and we're going to cover up all the deaths and illnesses, well then that's
[25:07.800 --> 25:15.360]  normal and that's a wonderful thing. So here we go. Overhead shot please. And again, I'm
[25:15.360 --> 25:19.040]  not injecting this in the fatty tissue. I know that there's nothing in it, so there's
[25:19.040 --> 25:22.000]  no point in delivering it to that. I'm doing it to the muscle. It'll be a little bit more
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.080]  illustrative. So I've got some poison on it right there. Let's see. There you go. Okay.
[25:28.080 --> 25:32.040]  Now, this will be all over the news. Alex Jones hurting someone or no, I'm not. It's
[25:32.040 --> 25:37.880]  a scientific illustration here. Completely in my right mind. Now, that's not scary to
[25:37.880 --> 25:40.720]  me because I know my body will heal, but if it had something deadly designed to take my
[25:40.720 --> 25:44.960]  body over and reprogram myself to produce a protein that goes into all the other cells
[25:44.960 --> 25:51.640]  in my body and makes me a toxic factory of prions, what causes mad cow disease and Nobel
[25:51.640 --> 25:56.400]  prize winners are warning about it and top EU advisors and the former chief scientist
[25:56.400 --> 26:03.080]  at Pfizer, you know, that's really what's crazy, folks, is do that. There's a little
[26:03.080 --> 26:10.040]  bit bigger of a start, you see. Big needle, I'm gonna jam my arm. Again, I love my body.
[26:10.040 --> 26:14.920]  I don't like doing this one bit, but you know what? I don't like watching what the new world
[26:14.920 --> 26:19.080]  order is doing to the children. I don't like watching people paralyzed and dying. I don't
[26:19.080 --> 26:23.960]  like watching all the things that are happening. So see, this is not a dangerous needle because
[26:23.960 --> 26:29.000]  there's nothing in it. But what Bill Gates is coming at you with is, and he needs to
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.400]  be held accountable along with the rest of them, they're assaulting us. This is war.
[26:33.400 --> 26:40.200]  To take a needle and to stick it into our arm like that and to put something deadly in
[26:40.200 --> 26:48.320]  us that they have prepared for us is an act of violence and it's wrong. So I ask you all,
[26:48.320 --> 26:54.440]  ladies and gentlemen, do you know what time it is now? Do you realize where we are in
[26:54.440 --> 27:01.520]  this universe? Because this is nothing but a delivery system for a weapon attacking
[27:01.520 --> 27:08.400]  you and your family. We're gonna go to break. I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna lay it all
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.240]  out for you, all the video, all of it. We're gonna open the phones up today as well. It's
[27:12.240 --> 27:16.200]  gonna be one hell of a Friday transmission and you've got my commitment. I'm gonna be
[27:16.200 --> 27:21.600]  back up here tomorrow for you, for myself and my family because God's watching and there's
[27:21.600 --> 27:24.440]  no way I'm rolling over this thing and I know you're not either. But this is it. This is
[27:24.440 --> 27:31.640]  the big takeover. World government force inoculation. Mark of the beast. Patifal takeover. I mean,
[27:31.640 --> 27:39.800]  it's just every demon on earth turned loose against decent people. I'm not scared. I'm
[27:39.800 --> 27:46.360]  scared for those that chose the wrong side, because God is going to take his time tearing
[27:46.360 --> 27:48.440]  you to pieces. We'll be right back.
[27:48.440 --> 28:04.800]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you
[28:04.800 --> 28:23.840]  the way you do it.
[28:23.840 --> 28:25.960]  Trouble a, two, five, three, three, three, one, three, nine,
[28:25.960 --> 28:27.480]  Is the infowar store hotline.
[28:27.480 --> 28:29.180]  Trouble a, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine,
[28:29.180 --> 28:30.520]  Is the Infowar store hotline.
[28:30.520 --> 28:31.100]  Taràng.
[28:31.100 --> 28:32.680]  Trouble a, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine,
[28:32.680 --> 28:34.800]  Is the infowar store hotline.
[28:34.800 --> 28:35.640]  Trouble a, two, three, three, three, one, three, nine,
[28:35.640 --> 28:37.200]  Is the Infowar store hotline.
[28:37.200 --> 28:40.820]  InfowarStore.com is simply the best,
[28:40.820 --> 28:43.700]  InfowarStore.com beats out all the rest.
[28:43.700 --> 28:45.900]  Trouble a, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine,
[28:45.900 --> 28:47.640]  Trouble a, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine,
[28:47.640 --> 28:49.420]  Trouble a, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine
[28:49.420 --> 29:03.860]  It's not a secret why and left us controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S.
[29:03.860 --> 29:07.820]  They encourage people to live in tents, cities as homeless, and to use drugs and alcohol
[29:07.820 --> 29:09.660]  and engage in petty crime.
[29:09.660 --> 29:14.660]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset,
[29:14.660 --> 29:17.420]  they want to lower expectations.
[29:17.420 --> 29:19.740]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere.
[29:19.740 --> 29:22.220]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[29:22.220 --> 29:25.980]  They want you to think of a civilization that gets progressively worse.
[29:25.980 --> 29:27.740]  The globalists fly around in private jets.
[29:27.740 --> 29:29.900]  They have huge private mistakes.
[29:29.900 --> 29:31.500]  They are separate from us.
[29:31.500 --> 29:33.300]  Their children go to private tutors.
[29:33.300 --> 29:34.300]  They admit this.
[29:34.300 --> 29:39.820]  And now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each other, so that we are not actually
[29:39.820 --> 29:42.420]  out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[29:42.420 --> 29:47.620]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been a controlled robot in autonomous cars
[29:47.620 --> 29:48.620]  and trucks.
[29:48.620 --> 29:50.140]  This is all their admitted plan.
[29:50.140 --> 29:53.740]  The public is finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta.
[29:53.740 --> 29:54.740]  It's gone operational.
[29:54.740 --> 29:55.740]  It's a post-human future.
[29:55.740 --> 29:58.380]  You better find out about it right now.
[29:58.380 --> 30:03.700]  The BioProse are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat
[30:03.700 --> 30:05.700]  everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[30:05.700 --> 30:10.700]  For the first time, the BioProse are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[30:10.700 --> 30:12.540]  products to the everyday consumer.
[30:12.540 --> 30:17.420]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSepticPro, a product specifically designed
[30:17.420 --> 30:20.060]  to establish a healthy septic system.
[30:20.060 --> 30:24.420]  BioSepticPro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[30:24.420 --> 30:26.340]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[30:26.340 --> 30:28.940]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[30:28.940 --> 30:33.860]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup, and odor guaranteed.
[30:33.860 --> 30:37.580]  BioSepticPro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[30:37.580 --> 30:41.820]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to
[30:41.820 --> 30:46.780]  treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times more effective than
[30:46.780 --> 30:47.780]  its competitors.
[30:47.780 --> 30:51.580]  BioSepticPro is safer plumbing, human, animal, and aquatic life.
[30:51.580 --> 30:57.060]  Secure your BioSepticPro today at TheBioProse.com for anaerobic septic tanks.
[30:57.060 --> 31:22.460]  TheBioProse.com You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:22.460 --> 31:41.620]  I heard myself today to see if I still feel, I focus on the pain, the only thing that's
[31:41.620 --> 32:06.460]  right for me right now is cancer.
[32:06.460 --> 32:20.060]  I've become my sweetest friend, my sweetest friend, everyone I know, everyone I know,
[32:20.060 --> 32:29.420]  goes away in the end. But you could have it all, my empire of dirt. We should play that
[32:29.420 --> 32:40.540]  song and show the disgusting, weak, spiritually empty G7 stumbling out on the stage like a
[32:40.540 --> 32:49.100]  bunch of reanimated corpses. Think about that long and hard. We're under literal world government
[32:49.100 --> 32:54.860]  assault. They don't just want to rule over everybody. They want control of our genetics to
[32:54.860 --> 33:01.900]  kill us because the God they follow promises them immortality once they've depopulated the
[33:01.900 --> 33:11.340]  species as if they're really going to be given that. I'm going to open the phones up for the entire
[33:13.580 --> 33:20.860]  second hour. And then I'm going to host the fourth hour intake calls.
[33:20.860 --> 33:28.140]  But I really thought that Judge Joe Brown did a great interview with me, an excellent interview
[33:28.140 --> 33:33.180]  with Owen Schreuer. But I thought he said some of the most powerful stuff that he didn't cover on
[33:33.180 --> 33:38.860]  this show in two visits with Harrison Smith on American Journal on Thursday.
[33:42.060 --> 33:46.620]  So we're going to air a couple segments of that at the end of the fourth hour today.
[33:46.620 --> 33:55.100]  Not because I don't want to blabber, but because it was really good. And we'll see what they put
[33:55.100 --> 33:58.780]  together for. I just said that was a great interview. You should re-air that. There it is.
[33:59.900 --> 34:07.580]  Judge Joe Brown unloads on the culture of emasculation. He explains it's a war on women,
[34:07.580 --> 34:12.700]  a war on men, a war on who we are to control us, to tell us who we are. And again, his interview
[34:12.700 --> 34:16.780]  with me has got over a million views on Band-Aid video. Harrison Smith only has 10,000. People
[34:16.780 --> 34:23.020]  need to visit and watch that because Harrison does a great job. And that's a popular show,
[34:23.020 --> 34:26.220]  but people need to click on his channel because there's a lot of big guests,
[34:26.220 --> 34:30.060]  a lot of things he covers. He did a great job today, sitting an hour and a half of his three hour
[34:30.060 --> 34:36.860]  show on the Alamo. Now they're trying to shut that down now. That's evil. All right, let me do this
[34:36.860 --> 34:46.380]  right now. I really was retrospective this morning why I've been so upset and obviously
[34:46.380 --> 34:49.660]  why you're upset. We know what's going on. This is really horrible what's happening, but
[34:51.340 --> 34:59.340]  I had some real clarity about what we need to do going forward and this is the fact that this is
[34:59.340 --> 35:03.580]  a big test and that it's God's plan and we should actually be happy that everything God said was
[35:03.580 --> 35:09.660]  going to happen is happening because we know who wins in the end. But specifically though,
[35:09.660 --> 35:16.060]  we do need to all have exit plans for ourselves because I always feel guilty about something
[35:17.180 --> 35:25.580]  if it's something I need to do. I never feel guilty about doing something I did for myself or
[35:25.580 --> 35:36.140]  doing something greedy. I mean, by that I never feel like that because I'm never doing that.
[35:36.140 --> 35:43.260]  Does that make sense? I never have guilt over being greedy or over doing bad things because I
[35:43.260 --> 35:50.860]  really don't do that much that's greedy or bad. I mean, I feel guilty for the opposite
[35:50.860 --> 35:58.220]  that I'm not doing enough and so that's confusing at first until you unpack it because that's why
[35:58.220 --> 36:04.620]  I was having confusion like why am I so guilty that I'm not getting prepared for me and my family
[36:09.100 --> 36:10.460]  when I shouldn't be?
[36:10.460 --> 36:19.900]  And then the answer was no, I'm not guilty that I'm getting ready for my family.
[36:21.100 --> 36:24.700]  I'm guilty that I'm not so it's a good thing. Does that make sense? Because I'm like,
[36:24.700 --> 36:29.980]  why are you guilty that you're getting ready to protect yourself when you actually haven't
[36:29.980 --> 36:34.540]  really been doing that? You understand? Like I'm so used to like you don't want to jam that needle
[36:34.540 --> 36:39.580]  in your arm to show everybody, you know, this is wrong. Do it. A little bit of guilt right there
[36:39.580 --> 36:44.060]  before I jam that needle in my arm. I don't want to do that. Go against my own self-preservation
[36:44.060 --> 36:48.220]  but for a greater self-preservation. So this is all very paradoxical. That's why we just
[36:48.220 --> 36:52.220]  heard what I said. It doesn't make sense when I'm saying it but that's exactly how it is.
[36:52.220 --> 36:58.140]  It's like Trump said the deepest thing he ever learned and the deepest thing in his life was
[36:58.140 --> 37:07.180]  learning to be shallow. Well, that's incredibly deep because your first approximation, a woman's
[37:07.180 --> 37:15.580]  first intuition, your first view of something is trillions of years of our development in God's mind
[37:17.580 --> 37:22.220]  and however many hundreds of thousands, millions, thousands, whatever you believe about
[37:22.220 --> 37:38.140]  the history of the earth of on this planet learning here and developing here. And so when you have that
[37:38.140 --> 37:43.500]  first approximation about something, that's not the first approximation. That's not just a half-assed
[37:43.500 --> 37:48.380]  look. That's why it's so exhausting if you're not a politician when you shake people's hand.
[37:48.380 --> 37:54.940]  If you actually talk to somebody and measure them and look at them and listen to them,
[37:54.940 --> 38:00.220]  they are sending to you who they are, what they want, all their anxiety, their concerns.
[38:00.220 --> 38:03.260]  You're there interfacing with them, trying to send them love
[38:05.500 --> 38:07.820]  because you've got to get home and pick up your four-year-old.
[38:11.180 --> 38:14.940]  That's an exhausting thing to be real. I know why the Satanists aren't real and are fake and don't
[38:14.940 --> 38:18.540]  care about anybody and are in their own little world, their own little simulation, their own little
[38:18.540 --> 38:23.100]  bubble because the spacewalk into eternity, into the universe, and they just open up to everything
[38:23.100 --> 38:32.140]  and go, I'm for real. That's heavy. It's also very empowering. It's like being on fire, but you don't
[38:32.140 --> 38:35.740]  burn up. You get stronger the longer you're in the fire. Well, I've been in the fire my whole life.
[38:35.740 --> 38:45.100]  I've been totally real, legitimate, bona fide, real McCoy, straight shooter since I came out of my mama,
[38:45.100 --> 38:51.740]  since I came out of the oven. I thought everybody was like me. I thought everybody was just straight
[38:51.740 --> 38:56.380]  up. Well, a lot of folks aren't, but we're coming to a time where if you're not straight up, you're
[38:56.380 --> 39:01.660]  going to be dead because the new old order is going to chew your ass up. The new old order respects
[39:01.660 --> 39:06.060]  those of us at Friday. It doesn't respect those of you that serve it and bow down to it, but you
[39:06.060 --> 39:14.780]  know, I just went off on this whole rant about, I don't know why I went into the point of that
[39:14.780 --> 39:26.140]  first look is, you know, is the depth is everything. But if I'm knowing that I've got to get prepared
[39:26.140 --> 39:32.220]  and that if I'm understanding that things are so bad, instead of me sitting there trying to
[39:32.220 --> 39:39.100]  spend that and ask myself why I'm not guilty, because it's the right thing to do, because
[39:39.100 --> 39:43.900]  us building our own community, our own system, pulling out of the new world order is the answer
[39:43.900 --> 39:49.420]  to everything. So I'm misinterpreting, not doing the show as much run into the country somewhere,
[39:49.420 --> 39:53.740]  getting ready, digging in, growing crops, getting prepared, trying to bring family with me,
[39:53.740 --> 39:57.100]  so we can protect each other. That's what we should have been doing the whole time,
[39:57.100 --> 40:01.740]  and we wouldn't have gotten to this point of being slaves now, because we don't have anybody,
[40:01.740 --> 40:06.140]  we don't have anything, we don't have resources, we're not prepared, we're domesticated.
[40:07.180 --> 40:13.340]  I'm way more able than most men. But compared to my grandfather, my dad's dad or my dad or
[40:13.340 --> 40:17.820]  somebody, I don't know how to do anything. Yeah, I can skin bucks, run trot lines, kick some ass,
[40:17.820 --> 40:23.660]  grow some crops, can't run electrical, don't know how to reprogram a computer, don't know how to do
[40:23.660 --> 40:28.220]  battlefield medicine, but I do know how to communicate. At least I've been doing that.
[40:28.860 --> 40:32.700]  But I'm saying we're entering a point now where we've got to keep trying to wake people up,
[40:32.700 --> 40:37.500]  but we've got to move, create our own system wherever it is, and just have nothing to do
[40:37.500 --> 40:41.020]  with the globalist. And they know that's going to happen. They say they know we're going to go
[40:41.020 --> 40:45.900]  build quote, ghettos that are outside their control. But that's where this is. So they're
[40:45.900 --> 40:49.420]  going to put us in a ghetto, and we're going to have to build our own ghetto just like this,
[40:50.140 --> 40:53.020]  you know, the Swiss figured out 500 years ago and created the honors.

[43:12.460 --> 43:18.540]  highly predatory and are setting up a false famously land system of constant bombardment
[43:18.540 --> 43:27.660]  of propaganda drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the very dna of the human species to
[43:27.660 --> 43:33.820]  mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard the bottom line is they
[43:33.820 --> 43:39.100]  want to play god they are playing god and the news is only going to tighten around our next from
[43:39.100 --> 43:44.060]  here on out so many other people want to be positive they want to put out fake news and
[43:44.060 --> 43:48.060]  want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with new world order but at the end of
[43:48.060 --> 43:51.900]  the day it's all about the population it's all about world government it's all about the end of
[43:52.540 --> 43:56.700]  human system as we know it and on its ashes a nightmare being built only admitting it can
[43:56.700 --> 44:02.620]  turn around and stop it you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very bittersweet everything
[44:02.620 --> 44:06.700]  we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility but
[44:06.700 --> 44:10.780]  i don't care about that i care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much
[44:10.780 --> 44:15.580]  credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and i don't have time to tell you all
[44:15.580 --> 44:19.740]  the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going on but let's just
[44:19.740 --> 44:24.940]  say this we're going to see this through the end we're going to stay on air as long as we can so

[44:39.020 --> 44:43.420]  justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth that's why the globalists
[44:43.420 --> 44:47.660]  are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air
[44:47.660 --> 44:51.740]  so while you're at it don't just financially support us and spread the word download everything

[44:55.660 --> 44:57.980]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[44:57.980 --> 45:13.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[45:16.620 --> 45:17.100]  by the way
[45:20.380 --> 45:21.340]  i want to be very clear
[45:21.340 --> 45:30.300]  here i know exactly why the globalists the planetary controllers are doing what they're
[45:30.300 --> 45:36.300]  doing i understand the deals they've cut i understand the different ways they sold out
[45:36.300 --> 45:40.380]  most of them never even realized what hit them most of the names you see up there are powerful
[45:40.380 --> 45:44.940]  globalist controllers aren't even the people that are actually in command the real power brokers
[45:44.940 --> 45:49.500]  won't control the future they won't control the human development they want the keys to the universe
[45:49.500 --> 45:56.220]  they don't care about the spotlight any of it in fact they don't put strong leaders up
[45:56.220 --> 45:58.140]  when you look at that g7 group of just
[46:00.700 --> 46:08.380]  dumpy dopey corrupt bureaucrats that's that's that's being done by design you've got the old pomp
[46:08.380 --> 46:18.460]  in circumstance and and the military regalia but that is a ceremonial vestigial trapping all of
[46:18.460 --> 46:29.180]  the old human system is being swept away and on its ashes built the satanic technocracy which i
[46:29.180 --> 46:36.780]  have seen the designs of and i think listeners now realize i don't make this stuff up i've seen
[46:36.780 --> 46:45.420]  the destaur plans i've seen different versions of what they're building because i've been offered
[46:45.420 --> 46:52.700]  to join with it and those with the system know how you're offered it let's just say it's not done
[46:52.700 --> 46:56.540]  in the customary way people think it's done it's done a little bit different
[47:00.300 --> 47:01.340]  it's done up on the mountain
[47:05.580 --> 47:09.420]  you don't think it was just jesus christ thought that visit
[47:09.420 --> 47:20.620]  it they all got the visit my dad got the visit i got the visit anybody that has
[47:20.620 --> 47:27.020]  the keys to destiny gets a visit and most people get a visit and they get on their knees at the
[47:27.020 --> 47:35.900]  four corners just like bob dillon did he went down to the crossroads he pledged himself to the
[47:35.900 --> 47:39.580]  supreme commander of this world
[47:46.220 --> 47:48.940]  you don't think the devil just offers you power do you
[47:51.580 --> 47:56.460]  you read all about that alistair crawley stuff that the left follows and all the rest of it
[47:57.980 --> 47:59.100]  you know what that is right
[47:59.100 --> 48:03.340]  you see ghostbusters
[48:06.380 --> 48:09.260]  where he's laying there in the bed that ghost comes in there and has sex with him
[48:10.300 --> 48:13.740]  that's what it's really all about and most of these people
[48:15.020 --> 48:20.380]  have an experience like that and like a crackhead they're signed on to it well not me
[48:22.620 --> 48:25.420]  if i see the devil you damn right i have
[48:25.420 --> 48:31.340]  and i've lived to tell about it most people turn into these zombies
[48:34.220 --> 48:38.140]  there's a lot of people do a lot of bad stuff to see the devil
[48:41.660 --> 48:45.340]  not me and i didn't like it
[48:47.660 --> 48:51.900]  and by the grace of god i did not succumb to it
[48:51.900 --> 48:57.260]  but you see that was the trick ladies and gentlemen
[48:59.660 --> 49:01.820]  because the lord works in mysterious ways
[49:03.180 --> 49:06.460]  and the sword while it's being formed has to go into the fire
[49:07.180 --> 49:13.180]  and has to be beaten by the hammers and only once you've done that
[49:16.380 --> 49:19.420]  can you actually be a sword fit to take on satan
[49:19.420 --> 49:23.580]  but when you look at those people on that stage
[49:24.940 --> 49:33.260]  they didn't even measure up to a visit from the chief commander that bob dillon talks about
[49:33.260 --> 49:36.140]  by the way you think i'm joking you guys pull up bob dillon talks about selling the soul of
[49:36.140 --> 49:41.900]  the devil there's two videos it's not a joke by the way i'm not dropping names bob dillon knows
[49:41.900 --> 49:48.780]  what he did bob dillon's a listener bob dillon thought he could go make a foustian deal and get
[49:48.780 --> 49:52.780]  out of it and then in the early 1980s he tried to become a christian for a while but
[49:53.900 --> 49:59.660]  he just like foust didn't believe he could get out of it and bob dillon's a satanist bob dillon worships
[49:59.660 --> 50:06.940]  the devil and it's not like the trailer park devil where you're killing your dog in the backyard
[50:06.940 --> 50:22.060]  but it it's a lot worse so when the devil comes and knocking you need to keep the door shut
[50:26.300 --> 50:30.780]  now i don't normally air report two days in a row i do it maybe once a month and
[50:30.780 --> 50:34.860]  you know i've got a lot i want to say a lot i want to do a lot i want to cover a lot i want to go over
[50:34.860 --> 50:45.260]  but i really think greg rees's report on nuremberg 2.0 is a key to to so much of this
[50:47.260 --> 50:55.100]  and we're going to air that to start the next time the phone's up specifically one topic
[50:55.100 --> 50:59.260]  callers i love you to death i don't do this very often but when i ask for it can we please do it
[50:59.260 --> 51:03.100]  because i really want to talk about this i want to get your view on it and help spur my mind to
[51:03.100 --> 51:17.180]  think about it more we can help each other and that's what do you make of being eased in to the
[51:17.180 --> 51:23.980]  market the beast i mean it's rolling out you want a cell phone got to have a injection want a job
[51:23.980 --> 51:28.060]  got to have this deadly injection want to go to the park and see a free concert in a public venue
[51:28.060 --> 51:32.940]  that's illegal in a park the taxpayer paid for it they're doing it they don't care it's a
[51:32.940 --> 51:39.820]  revolution i'm gonna play that start of the next hour the video is on info wars.com it's here and
[51:39.820 --> 51:46.060]  it's poisoned right away i thought they just set a precedent and give us a placebo but they're like
[51:46.060 --> 51:50.540]  why do that let's just manage how to kill a bunch of people so you better believe them if they get
[51:50.540 --> 51:54.860]  away with killing all these people and happen the media just go oh rare cases we're studying in
[51:54.860 --> 52:03.100]  every town every hospital then they're going to go big so their beta test is so deadly
[52:05.420 --> 52:10.140]  that i just realized it's like i said operational and i guess that's it i even lied to myself like
[52:10.140 --> 52:15.100]  oh there's still time it's 10 years off we can hold it back uh no that's not how it works
[52:15.980 --> 52:23.340]  revelation says satan wages war against the saints and overcomes them but that's only one
[52:23.340 --> 52:31.820]  wave one assault when the battle lose the war devil the process of us being destroyed will
[52:31.820 --> 52:37.740]  wake up that whole generation growing up under this that is only under the devil's control for
[52:37.740 --> 52:43.900]  a few years and the huge total rejection of everything that is satanism i mean this is a
[52:43.900 --> 52:51.500]  beautiful time to be alive and and to be sacrificed of our own free will to be christlike that is
[52:51.500 --> 52:59.500]  such a gift from the creator wow thank you god for that let me say this or we won't be here um i
[52:59.500 --> 53:03.260]  want to stay on air as long as possible this stuff's so heavy at the time i'm just like screw it i'm
[53:03.260 --> 53:06.460]  not getting plug products they don't want them whatever we'll just go off here but that's a
[53:06.460 --> 53:12.780]  loser talk we need money we got products you need go to info war store dot com and buy the products
[53:13.340 --> 53:19.740]  now i'm really proud of this uh i don't want to give myself credit but people don't buy it if i
[53:19.740 --> 53:25.820]  don't say i'm involved with it and i am involved folks have a patent that's partially held by a
[53:25.820 --> 53:30.380]  big oil company and a bunch of scientists and one of the main scientists that's part of the patent
[53:30.380 --> 53:37.340]  is a listener and nobody ever brought this in 30 years to the general population and he doesn't
[53:37.340 --> 53:41.340]  just do septic tanks he does everything but they want to come out with a packaging for each one
[53:41.340 --> 53:47.580]  so this is for your septic tank and uh it's a hundred times more effective the scientists are
[53:47.580 --> 53:52.540]  saying and we've done it and tested it than enzymes and it just keeps growing in your septic tank
[53:52.540 --> 53:56.460]  it'll eat leather shoes it'll eat it'll eat people i'm not saying you need it for that but
[53:56.460 --> 54:01.740]  you know this eats everything and it's not gmo it's natural but bread it's like oh that pit bull
[54:01.740 --> 54:07.500]  is natural but it's bread it's it's it's gmo the old-fashioned way of breeding uh it it'll eat

[58:04.940 --> 58:11.180]  dr fulmick is the public frontman for an international team comprised of hundreds of
[58:11.180 --> 58:17.980]  lawyers and medical experts who have begun legal proceedings over the cdc the who
[58:18.540 --> 58:26.780]  and the davos group for committing crimes against humanity the protocol for the pcr test given by
[58:26.780 --> 58:35.980]  the who and the cdc was knowingly set to a level that guaranteed 100% false positives or false
[58:35.980 --> 58:42.140]  negatives so there is no pandemic this is all about getting people to take the shot their
[58:42.140 --> 58:48.300]  argument is that we are at the very least being subjected to an illegal experiment and at the
[58:48.300 --> 58:55.660]  worst global genocide dr fulmick points out how the experimental jab is in clear violation of all
[58:55.660 --> 59:01.740]  10 of the nuremberg codes which carry the penalty of death for those who violate them
[59:01.740 --> 59:08.780]  number one voluntary consent is absolutely essential there should be no intervention
[59:08.780 --> 59:17.740]  or any element of force fraud deceit duress or any form of constraint or coercion by definition
[59:17.740 --> 59:23.660]  a vaccine must provide immunity to the virus protect recipients from getting the virus
[59:23.660 --> 59:32.380]  reduce deaths infections circulation and transmission of the virus we are told the experimental jab
[59:32.380 --> 59:39.820]  does none of these yet they fraudulently call it a vaccine as far as duress constraint and
[59:39.820 --> 59:48.460]  coercion it's everywhere if you want your life back get the shot number two the experiment should
[59:48.460 --> 59:55.420]  be such as to yield fruitful results un procurable by other methods the most fruitful method would
[59:55.420 --> 1:00:01.180]  be a healthy immune system which can be achieved through good health and natural supplements such
[1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:08.460]  as vitamin d vitamin c and zinc but the people are not being told this in fact those who pointed
[1:00:08.460 --> 1:00:15.180]  out are being vilified and silenced number three the experiment should be designed and based on
[1:00:15.180 --> 1:00:21.980]  the results of animal experimentation this experimental jab skipped animal testing number four
[1:00:22.700 --> 1:00:29.180]  the experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering
[1:00:29.180 --> 1:00:36.300]  and injury according to official reports there are already thousands of deaths and over a quarter
[1:00:36.300 --> 1:00:42.780]  million injuries from this experiment number five no experiment should be conducted where there is
[1:00:42.780 --> 1:00:49.500]  an a priory reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur past trials have
[1:00:49.500 --> 1:00:55.980]  shown a strong possibility that these new spike proteins will cause a body to attack itself this
[1:00:55.980 --> 1:01:04.860]  is known as antibody dependent enhancement or ade a Nobel prize-winning virologist says the
[1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:14.140]  vaccine is creating the variance number six the risk should never exceed the benefit covid-19
[1:01:14.140 --> 1:01:21.820]  has a 98 to 99 survival rate less deadly than the seasonal flu the experimental jab is already the
[1:01:21.820 --> 1:01:29.820]  most dangerous vaccine in veyors 30 year history number seven proper preparations should be made
[1:01:29.820 --> 1:01:35.420]  and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote
[1:01:35.420 --> 1:01:42.300]  possibilities of injury disability or death there were no preparations made there are no
[1:01:42.300 --> 1:01:49.420]  facilities the subject shows up for their shot and goes home number eight the experiment should
[1:01:49.420 --> 1:01:56.700]  be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons this experiment has been exclusively run
[1:01:56.700 --> 1:02:06.460]  by politicians the media celebrities and big pharma bureaucrats number nine the subject should be at
[1:02:06.460 --> 1:02:12.300]  liberty to bring the experiment to an end thousands of medical experts have attempted to end this
[1:02:12.300 --> 1:02:18.940]  madness and their voices continue to be silenced number ten the experiment must be brought to
[1:02:18.940 --> 1:02:27.100]  an end if resulting in injury or death and yet the experiment pushes on once again those who
[1:02:27.100 --> 1:02:33.580]  violate these international laws are subject to the death penalty legal proceedings are moving
[1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:39.580]  forward and evidence is being collected whistleblowers are directed to contact the international
[1:02:39.580 --> 1:02:47.740]  team at www.securewhistleblower.com this is likely the biggest crime ever committed against the world
[1:02:47.740 --> 1:02:53.340]  population and the question is do we still have a judicial system to exact justice
[1:02:56.460 --> 1:03:02.620]  as negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be you have to understand
[1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:11.260]  that this is all a test this experience this life on this planet is a reckoning it's god
[1:03:12.140 --> 1:03:16.780]  giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend
[1:03:16.780 --> 1:03:23.100]  eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come down to that so as saddest things
[1:03:23.100 --> 1:03:27.340]  are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as well and realize that god
[1:03:27.340 --> 1:03:33.740]  is the author of our consciousness god is the author of us having our own will god is the
[1:03:33.740 --> 1:03:40.380]  author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing when you look at mainstream
[1:03:40.380 --> 1:03:46.540]  media in hollywood this whole evil culture in washington dc and fauci and the and the mass cult
[1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:50.780]  it's all about dominating a free will it's all about telling you you're dirty you're ugly you're
[1:03:50.780 --> 1:03:55.660]  in the bad because satan hates you because you're made in the image of god the creator of the universe
[1:04:01.820 --> 1:04:09.740]  we now take you live we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart
[1:04:09.740 --> 1:04:15.100]  and the heart of the resistance rally rallying patriots worldwide
[1:04:19.340 --> 1:04:21.980]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:04:26.780 --> 1:04:35.740]  stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive we are the dealers will give you everything
[1:04:35.740 --> 1:04:43.180]  we need hang on to the good times
[1:04:43.180 --> 1:05:02.620]  the god is the author of success of life not the devil
[1:05:02.620 --> 1:05:11.660]  i
[1:05:11.660 --> 1:05:12.780]  let's get into it right now
[1:05:16.300 --> 1:05:21.180]  first i want to say i'm blessed and honored to be live on air with you and i love you i mean it
[1:05:22.060 --> 1:05:26.940]  god i love the hell out of every damn one of you even that stupid ass clash wav
[1:05:26.940 --> 1:05:32.380]  he's a little loser a little tough guy professor that totied up and literally got on his knees
[1:05:32.380 --> 1:05:37.980]  a henry kissinger and then he sold out the satan that's somebody we lost i'm not happy about that
[1:05:39.100 --> 1:05:44.300]  i don't need to defeat those people to feel big but i will defeat them because they're hurting innocent
[1:05:44.300 --> 1:05:54.380]  people in fact i pray for their destruction but it's got to be done on god's time in god's way
[1:05:55.020 --> 1:05:59.340]  and that means we take action we expose them we resist them they try to physically attack us we
[1:05:59.340 --> 1:06:06.780]  deal with them but just let god do it god's always putting the english on that ball like you can't
[1:06:06.780 --> 1:06:11.180]  even believe like imagine the best pool player you ever saw getting like spin that ball and hit
[1:06:11.180 --> 1:06:16.540]  one ball and knock another in imagine god just hits it one time and knocks every ball in and then
[1:06:16.540 --> 1:06:23.820]  builds a universe on the back side of it that's what we're talking about whole universe just like
[1:06:23.820 --> 1:06:32.860]  like one trillion of a second god's mind i was and then you've got these people try to play god
[1:06:32.860 --> 1:06:38.460]  like bill gates hey bill gates you don't look like a god to me you sure as hell don't sound one
[1:06:38.460 --> 1:06:41.900]  and all you do is want to kill people that doesn't sound too good
[1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:51.420]  because you want to kill yourself bill and see bill i don't wish to harm upon you but before you
[1:06:51.420 --> 1:06:56.620]  kill any more people i want to ask bill gates here today since you want to be popular like the
[1:06:56.620 --> 1:07:04.140]  planet to man up son i i actually pledge this in front of god and country i'm against suicide
[1:07:04.140 --> 1:07:09.580]  i'm not suicidal i would never kill myself but you know those guys at the battle in midway
[1:07:10.220 --> 1:07:14.300]  flying that second mission 10 to 1 against those aircraft carriers this is a suicide mission
[1:07:15.100 --> 1:07:19.420]  most of them did 80 didn't come back they did it because they signed up for it they were men
[1:07:19.420 --> 1:07:25.820]  so i've got an easy job in front of that right except the enemy hides themselves so
[1:07:25.820 --> 1:07:30.300]  i'm going to issue the bill gates challenge you've heard of the the ice bucket challenge
[1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:36.060]  all the rest of it if the earth is overpopulated and bill gates is right he's got some points
[1:07:37.580 --> 1:07:44.060]  if bill gates gets a 44 magnum on air shoves it in his mouth and blows his brains out the back of
[1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:50.300]  his head the next day after it's confirmed he's dead i will blow my brains out on air
[1:07:51.900 --> 1:07:58.940]  i'm serious if bill gates will blow his brains out i will blow my brains out on air the next day
[1:07:58.940 --> 1:08:03.340]  and then we will just do that let's have a suicide challenge i mean if humanity's so bad
[1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:09.340]  if humanity's so evil if we're so dirty and we all need to die and let's start with babies and
[1:08:09.340 --> 1:08:13.820]  let's kill all those black people and everybody else well okay let's go first then bill
[1:08:17.020 --> 1:08:21.180]  that's my challenge it's called the suicide challenge i don't want veterans to feel bad
[1:08:21.180 --> 1:08:24.860]  about themselves and kill themselves you don't do that you go out and have a great time i don't want
[1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:30.060]  poor women uh uh you know addicted to drugs to kill themselves i want them to realize how much
[1:08:30.060 --> 1:08:35.500]  value they've got i don't want anybody to kill themselves except for people that say we all
[1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:41.420]  need to die so you can do another ice buck challenge bill at your house where you dump
[1:08:41.420 --> 1:08:46.460]  gasoline on yourself out of a bucket because you want to go out with a bang right and maybe you
[1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:52.540]  scrap tmt all on yourself because you're back Islam and then you dump gasoline on yourself bill
[1:08:53.820 --> 1:08:56.620]  and then you light yourself on fire how about that
[1:08:56.620 --> 1:09:05.100]  or a thousand pound guillotine a giant blade you pull that cut you right down the middle
[1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:11.740]  in the vivisection how about that billy boy because i'm sending that love it's you right now
[1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:18.860]  bill gates you want to kill humanity then i say you do it right now you call for death gates
[1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:24.940]  then i call for you in the name of jesus christ to show us what you're gonna do and show us your
[1:09:24.940 --> 1:09:37.980]  commitment you want us to die leave the way gates do it and i will blow my brains out the next day

[1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:09.020]  our babies and you the viewers that listen to the show you heard everything i said the provides
[1:10:09.020 --> 1:10:14.860]  those and all of it you'll see this on the news alex jones calls for suicide alex jones calls
[1:10:14.860 --> 1:10:20.140]  for bill gates death alex jones all that no i didn't do that they're the ones in the news saying
[1:10:20.140 --> 1:10:28.780]  don't have babies kill your baby and i'm saying let's not kill our baby bill let's kill ourselves
[1:10:28.780 --> 1:10:34.860]  we're men we're big boys bill let's show everybody how we do it you little ugly duckling
[1:10:35.980 --> 1:10:43.820]  let's see you do it okay maybe you don't like 44 magnums i bet i'm tough enough
[1:10:43.820 --> 1:10:49.580]  that could be like an old roman or a samurai and stick a razor sharp dagger in my liver on the
[1:10:50.780 --> 1:10:55.980]  right side and take it all the way up in one movement stick it right in my heart
[1:10:57.020 --> 1:11:03.900]  how about seppuku you want us to die you're a human but you don't like humanity then i say
[1:11:03.900 --> 1:11:14.060]  die die die die show me the death show me the way gates show me what it is you want
[1:11:16.220 --> 1:11:24.220]  if you do maybe you'll be given a new body and new troops to command gates but you didn't
[1:11:24.220 --> 1:11:33.420]  sacrifice in war like we did thousands of times you gave up on humanity over and over again and
[1:11:33.420 --> 1:11:43.340]  it's why you were never sent back you've been sent straight to hell so no one hold their breath
[1:11:44.940 --> 1:11:51.980]  bill gates isn't gonna blow his brains out on air tomorrow because bill gates is a damn coward
[1:11:53.020 --> 1:12:01.900]  he runs his mouth all day about death and how he'll deliver the death and how he is
[1:12:01.900 --> 1:12:10.700]  the executor of death but if you haven't died gates you don't know anything about death
[1:12:12.620 --> 1:12:19.580]  and bill you don't even understand the riddles because you can't read it because you don't
[1:12:19.580 --> 1:12:29.020]  know our language and bill you've not been born again you've not been given a new body
[1:12:29.020 --> 1:12:37.180]  and fruits to command and that's why you're so pissed but let me tell you humanity will
[1:12:37.180 --> 1:12:43.420]  transcend you and all of you scum and we will survive and we will people the stars and we will
[1:12:43.420 --> 1:12:55.340]  follow god's will and it is going to be beautiful you've not been given a new body bill you won't
[1:12:55.340 --> 1:13:02.780]  be given fruits to command because you are a loser everyone hates you everyone hates kamala

[1:27:54.300 --> 1:27:57.660]  i've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air
[1:27:58.780 --> 1:28:03.420]  about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist that the public's so dumb down
[1:28:03.420 --> 1:28:06.780]  that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them that we're poisoning them that
[1:28:06.780 --> 1:28:12.460]  we're sterilizing them then they deserve to be killed yes that's the position of the globalist
[1:28:12.460 --> 1:28:17.180]  they play god and they think because we don't stand up they have a right to do this to us
[1:28:17.980 --> 1:28:22.380]  you know i've told you that the globals have tried to harm me they try to get me to join them
[1:28:22.380 --> 1:28:28.780]  but metaphysically at a spiritual level i have the holy spirit i'm connection with gods and i know
[1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:33.580]  that god does not like that so i cannot join the enemy but i'll tell you at a selfish level
[1:28:33.580 --> 1:28:38.540]  i get very very mad at people that go along with the system believing you're part of it or
[1:28:38.540 --> 1:28:43.260]  believing you're getting power on them whether you're just a steel worker or a school teacher
[1:28:43.260 --> 1:28:50.060]  or a kenry kissinger you're not god and treating other people like they're animals and your god
[1:28:50.060 --> 1:28:53.820]  is something that the real god of the universe doesn't like and that's a fact
[1:28:53.820 --> 1:29:00.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:31:30.780 --> 1:31:34.380]  i only had time to read two pages of it it's nightmare everything we already knew it's the
[1:31:34.380 --> 1:31:42.780]  same stuff over over again dovetails with this whole report and this report which is incredible

[1:32:17.100 --> 1:32:22.460]  that stack's not a prop that stack's not a prop that stack's not a prop that stack's not a prop
[1:32:22.460 --> 1:32:27.180]  that's that that's that that's that that's that that's that that's that that's that that's that that's
[1:32:27.180 --> 1:32:36.700]  that they're all just as horrible i mean they're on tv saying they're gonna take children at
[1:32:36.700 --> 1:32:40.700]  birth and put them with pedophiles like they do in germany they're on there saying they're gonna
[1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:47.900]  put brain ships in you on tv i mean it's all just that's what i was thinking about last time i was
[1:32:47.900 --> 1:32:53.100]  like why am i getting so upset this is like at a certain point do i even come in here and read
[1:32:53.100 --> 1:32:59.980]  you another hundred articles about people having Alzheimer's at 25 or brain damage or the bleeding
[1:32:59.980 --> 1:33:04.940]  lungs or heart attacks in depth i mean i got stacks of news about that do i play a tucker
[1:33:04.940 --> 1:33:09.900]  carlson with how they're having emergency meetings that the cdc about the death by the vaccines
[1:33:09.900 --> 1:33:21.100]  it'd be like if a serial killer was waiting at four o'clock every day when elementary kids got
[1:33:21.100 --> 1:33:28.140]  off buses and shooting them with a machine gun and they'd done this for like six months and you
[1:33:28.140 --> 1:33:33.740]  even know where he's doing it when he's doing it but instead you just go well by the way yesterday
[1:33:33.740 --> 1:33:39.100]  another 50 children were killed getting off two school buses you'd say hey why aren't you doing
[1:33:39.100 --> 1:33:44.060]  something about it and that's all i'm saying is i feel guilty every minute
[1:33:47.740 --> 1:33:52.540]  oh oh this is it this is it and i'm not calling for violence because i'm not sure that's what's
[1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:57.180]  needed right now because they're gonna twist that around against us but here's where my guilt is
[1:33:57.180 --> 1:34:01.900]  my guilt is i'm never an indecision guy i'm always a decisive person but this is the big decision
[1:34:02.540 --> 1:34:08.060]  do we go to physical war with these people or do we go build our own communities and just
[1:34:08.060 --> 1:34:17.420]  withdraw from the enemy and then how do you do that that's like herding cats i just keep getting
[1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:23.980]  up here on air and thinking if i tell you what i think we should do you're gonna fix it not because
[1:34:23.980 --> 1:34:34.300]  you're my slave i i look up to you see they wouldn't have got away with this in my grandfather's time
[1:34:34.300 --> 1:34:38.540]  and they weren't perfect but they were not going to go along with this they'd seen right through
[1:34:40.780 --> 1:34:44.300]  and see there was always something about those guys and all those guys i know
[1:34:45.020 --> 1:34:49.660]  because they were all just as happy as a pig and you know what but if somebody tried to
[1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:54.860]  make them do stuff like this they would never have done it and the globalists spiritually
[1:34:54.860 --> 1:35:01.900]  knew that if they tried like this to do this they would get taken out and so that's really what this
[1:35:01.900 --> 1:35:09.980]  is the guardians are gone we're all about your sheep and the wolves are running crazy on everybody
[1:35:09.980 --> 1:35:12.300]  and i said i'd take calls this whole hour and i haven't
[1:35:15.100 --> 1:35:18.620]  but i do have two interesting guys a bit on their show they do a comedy show
[1:35:20.380 --> 1:35:24.620]  and i think they're pretty funny some people don't like them here at the office i like them
[1:35:24.620 --> 1:35:29.260]  i know harris and smith like some revenge of the cis i guess that means people who are normal
[1:35:29.260 --> 1:35:36.540]  we got roice lopez and mike marsh coming on the show but i'm sure they'll be okay to take
[1:35:36.540 --> 1:35:40.380]  a few calls as well but i just don't want to load the phones up and then not get to your calls
[1:35:42.540 --> 1:35:50.780]  but then how am i going to cover this boom boom boom because that's boom boom boom i've got three
[1:35:50.780 --> 1:35:56.380]  of these babies and man this is the rest of our lives you know imagine going to a play listen to
[1:35:56.380 --> 1:35:59.980]  me very carefully because i say a lot of important stuff but i mean this is really important
[1:36:01.580 --> 1:36:06.140]  imagine going to a play that's got like three acts and you figure out halfway through that the
[1:36:06.140 --> 1:36:11.260]  play is about you at that theater and that at the end of the act you're going to be killed
[1:36:16.860 --> 1:36:21.740]  and the ushers are looking at you by the last act they've got their swords out they're sharpening
[1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:27.420]  them they got a barbecue spit fired up the state that's they're all looking at you and you're like
[1:36:27.420 --> 1:36:38.940]  oh i'm the star of this event i'm the bbq and that's what this is they got every damn bit of it
[1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:54.220]  lined up for you right here every benefit every stitch of it every foot of it and i'm just asking
[1:36:54.220 --> 1:37:01.420]  what are you gonna do about it so i'm gonna host the fourth hour i intended to air some
[1:37:01.420 --> 1:37:09.820]  harris and smith stuff but we'll see what happens the point is is we're gonna cover this fourth hour
[1:37:09.820 --> 1:37:18.300]  today and it's painful to read i know you don't want to know either do i you think i like all this
[1:37:18.300 --> 1:37:23.340]  you think i want to keep doing this you got the wrong McCoy here baby i'm not looking for a fight
[1:37:23.340 --> 1:37:28.140]  i'm not looking for war i'm a lover but if i gotta be a killer i'll do it i'm not a fighter i'm a
[1:37:28.140 --> 1:37:33.420]  killer because if i gotta fight you i'm just gonna get you out of the way because i don't got time
[1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:40.860]  anymore for your games i swear to god it's the last thing i do you people that have done this
[1:37:40.860 --> 1:37:45.020]  are gonna pay big you think you're gonna kill a bunch of these average people and get away with it
[1:37:45.020 --> 1:37:50.700]  that's not how the universe works so we're gonna go to break here's the toll-free number i should
[1:37:50.700 --> 1:37:59.740]  give that up they call toll-free number 877-789-2539 what do you make of bill gates as declaration
[1:37:59.740 --> 1:38:05.180]  of war and then launching it and the mark of the beast and you can't go to the park
[1:38:05.180 --> 1:38:10.700]  unless you've had a deadly injection i want to know what you think we're supposed to do
[1:38:10.700 --> 1:38:23.740]  do 877-789-2539 877-789 alex because my ancestors didn't fight this hard and we didn't come this
[1:38:23.740 --> 1:38:30.460]  far and we didn't do all this dominating the natural elements and all the rest of it to be run by a
[1:38:30.460 --> 1:38:40.220]  bunch of vampire bats like gg ping and claus wab i asked god to inter dimensionally intercede
[1:38:40.860 --> 1:38:50.460]  against gg ping and claus wab and bill gates i asked god to metaphysically intervene now
[1:38:53.420 --> 1:38:58.700]  i'm a very humble person but i'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with the
[1:38:58.700 --> 1:39:03.180]  globals attacking humanity with all the terrible things that are unfolding i want you to know
[1:39:03.180 --> 1:39:09.180]  a lot of positive things are happening as well i'm a public figure so i get to see things the
[1:39:09.180 --> 1:39:13.180]  general public doesn't get to see and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs or members of
[1:39:13.180 --> 1:39:20.300]  congress or even folks in hollywood or or or mainstream media or industry people are really
[1:39:20.300 --> 1:39:25.580]  really awake in the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalists but they're scared
[1:39:25.580 --> 1:39:31.740]  they're looking for leadership well that's where m4 comes in you fund us you support m4 store.com
[1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:36.620]  you get great privacy at the same time we will then go out and do what the globalists say is
[1:39:36.620 --> 1:39:42.060]  unpopular what the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth
[1:39:42.060 --> 1:39:48.780]  and to take the heat that's our job so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can
[1:39:48.780 --> 1:39:55.980]  give me the shock groups and the information war fund us at m4store.com big pharma was born out of the
[1:39:55.980 --> 1:40:03.820]  Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical the petrochemical then dominated two major
[1:40:03.820 --> 1:40:10.780]  industries plastics and drugs companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally
[1:40:10.780 --> 1:40:17.100]  sourced drugs the natural sources were then made illegal pharmaceuticals became medicine
[1:40:17.100 --> 1:40:23.500]  and the sicker people got the more their industry grew it's a death cult and it's up to the individual
[1:40:23.500 --> 1:40:30.220]  to escape good health begins with a healthy immune system which needs the proper nutrients to thrive
[1:40:30.780 --> 1:40:37.020]  nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today the combinations of vitamin c and zinc
[1:40:37.020 --> 1:40:44.060]  and vitamin d3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system
[1:40:44.060 --> 1:40:50.300]  go to m4store.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega immune support
[1:40:50.300 --> 1:40:59.340]  pack now 40 off i'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious i'm saying it because
[1:40:59.340 --> 1:41:05.420]  it's the key to victory over these criminals last week the arch globalist foushee admitted
[1:41:05.980 --> 1:41:13.260]  that roughly half of the cdcs top brass and workers medical doctors scientists nurses you name it
[1:41:13.260 --> 1:41:19.420]  have taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot i'm gonna say the second time around half of the
[1:41:19.420 --> 1:41:28.140]  doctors at the cdc and nih refused to take the franken shots they don't trust it you shouldn't
[1:41:28.140 --> 1:41:32.780]  trust it the vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world this is an attack
[1:41:32.780 --> 1:41:38.860]  on the american people the people of the world this is an absolute red flag smoking gun again
[1:41:38.860 --> 1:41:44.700]  let me say it two more times around half the individuals that work at the niasian cdc the
[1:41:44.700 --> 1:41:49.980]  medical staff refused to take the vaccines that's right the doctors nurses scientists do not trust
[1:41:49.980 --> 1:41:54.140]  a so-called vaccine and you you shouldn't either you should want everyone you know about the truth
[1:41:55.100 --> 1:41:59.980]  it's not a secret why in leftist controlled cities all over the world not just the us
[1:41:59.980 --> 1:42:04.140]  they encourage people to live in tents and he's as homeless and he used drugs and alcohol and
[1:42:04.140 --> 1:42:09.900]  engaged petty crime it's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030 of course a
[1:42:09.900 --> 1:42:15.660]  great reset they want to lower expectations they don't want you to think of having sanitary systems
[1:42:15.660 --> 1:42:18.940]  everywhere they don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better they want you
[1:42:18.940 --> 1:42:23.900]  to think of civilization that gets progressively worse the globalists fly around in private jets
[1:42:23.900 --> 1:42:29.660]  they have huge private mistakes they are separate from us their children go to private tutors they
[1:42:29.660 --> 1:42:35.340]  admit this and now they want us to lock down telecommunicating with each other so that we
[1:42:35.340 --> 1:42:39.980]  are not actually out physically building a pro human infrastructure the infrastructure that's
[1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:46.460]  left under 5g is going to control robot autonomous cars and trucks this is all their admitted plan
[1:42:46.460 --> 1:42:51.180]  the public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta it's gone operational it's a
[1:42:51.180 --> 1:43:04.300]  post-human future you better find out about it right now you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:43:14.700 --> 1:43:18.700]  you know if i seem wound up it's because i'm in a death battle
[1:43:18.700 --> 1:43:26.940]  and i'm exhausted so i can't go 10% speed oh my god it's 100% speed thanks for putting up with me
[1:43:27.660 --> 1:43:32.780]  but i uh i've experienced it i've faced it i know how real it is that's why i'm so
[1:43:32.780 --> 1:43:40.140]  whacked out because reality is whacked out and i just i don't have low speed anymore
[1:43:40.140 --> 1:43:46.300]  let's go to your phone calls like i said the fourth hour i'm going to hit
[1:43:48.540 --> 1:43:53.580]  the imf world bank bank or takeover of the planet how they're going to make people so poor and just
[1:43:53.580 --> 1:43:58.140]  take everything away from you then and then make you do all these physical things to yourself to
[1:43:58.140 --> 1:44:03.340]  become sterile it'll just give you the money then to commit suicide and how they're going to use
[1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:08.620]  big pharma to totally destroy everybody and they see it as a mopping up operation to you know save
[1:44:08.620 --> 1:44:14.380]  the planet from a human over bloom uh you know a species out of control but the really the you know
[1:44:14.380 --> 1:44:20.460]  the truth is they're the disease and and and they're the ones that have blocked real technological
[1:44:20.460 --> 1:44:25.180]  development that would have fixed all this innovation is the key not enslavement
[1:44:27.420 --> 1:44:33.100]  i just need the public to realize that this is real okay like i'm real okay this show is real
[1:44:33.100 --> 1:44:38.700]  what we cover is real this is not a joke all right i'll leave it at that this is not a joke okay
[1:44:39.980 --> 1:44:45.660]  and and and the good news is as i go to your phone calls you see all these other scientists and
[1:44:45.660 --> 1:44:51.980]  doctors everywhere saying the the the vaccines are poison everywhere saying no so i'm really proud
[1:44:51.980 --> 1:44:59.180]  of humanity actually but i'm impressed by big tech able to suppress these thousands and thousands
[1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:05.820]  of doctors and nurses and scientists all the top ones because they don't run things it's the corporate
[1:45:05.820 --> 1:45:12.380]  CEOs that are psychotic and don't care they're in charge still well it's pretty easy to deal with them
[1:45:12.380 --> 1:45:18.140]  isn't it mm-hmm and we've been doing Bill Gates destroy them politically destroy their name the
[1:45:18.140 --> 1:45:29.580]  rest will follow but i'll i'll just quote john paul jones here and i'll say i've only begun to fight
[1:45:30.140 --> 1:45:40.700]  but it's the intensity of the enemy attack is just spectacular i mean they're really doing it i mean
[1:45:40.700 --> 1:45:45.660]  if you kill one and it's a person god wants to destroy you anybody that's spiritually dolled
[1:45:45.660 --> 1:45:51.020]  in those men that's like if somebody is an attack on you and you kill an innocent god does not
[1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:56.220]  like whoa the whole western military is all about don't kill innocents because you do that
[1:45:56.220 --> 1:46:01.660]  it creates back people just people didn't care like i'll kill civilians all of a sudden bad
[1:46:01.660 --> 1:46:05.740]  stuff happens like i killed civilians your wife gets cancer your kid dies in a car next week
[1:46:05.740 --> 1:46:10.540]  the militaries weren't like oh we think shoveling where do you think shoveling came from
[1:46:10.540 --> 1:46:17.340]  not does he feel more perfect they figured out if i kill some innocent person it comes back on me i
[1:46:17.340 --> 1:46:23.180]  don't want to do that and that's where we are right now is the globalist are committing crimes
[1:46:23.180 --> 1:46:30.620]  against the law of the universe and we better decide that we're not part of that and clearly
[1:46:31.180 --> 1:46:38.060]  mark our doorways with blood like the israelites did with ramsey's the second and say we're not
[1:46:38.060 --> 1:46:43.340]  with this so however you mark your house man you just better do it
[1:46:49.180 --> 1:46:51.980]  and since i bring up an israeli or jewish angle
[1:46:53.020 --> 1:46:58.380]  Benjamin yahu's pharaoh i was never even against that y'all he's just take the chip world government
[1:46:58.380 --> 1:47:04.220]  force inoculation he's just like boris johnson they're all devils now it no matter who they were
[1:47:04.220 --> 1:47:13.260]  they vowed to say i don't care i'm trying to figure out what i'm gonna do with trump right now
[1:47:13.900 --> 1:47:17.820]  because it's coming out with the vaccines are killing people it's coming out they're poison
[1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:24.540]  and he's still up there like a big-ass rooster telling us how proud he is of it all and i i
[1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:29.500]  and i get he's getting good republicans elected and he said they hate him and i like from but
[1:47:29.500 --> 1:47:39.900]  but i got a problem all right let's go to all these callers jim craig and scott and
[1:47:39.900 --> 1:47:47.020]  zack and marty and patrick and max and james and jack and carlos and so many others let's go to
[1:47:47.020 --> 1:47:54.780]  zack in idaho first you're on the air all right so i've been thinking i've been listening to you
[1:47:54.780 --> 1:48:02.220]  probably for 12 13 years now but um in order for us to take the neural uplink and merge with machine
[1:48:03.020 --> 1:48:12.060]  our dna has to be changed to allow the machine into our our already neural link so people are i
[1:48:12.060 --> 1:48:18.060]  think people are dying because some people's genetics will not allow the that's it they're
[1:48:18.060 --> 1:48:23.660]  exactly i've said this last week you're so god i thought my lip take calls you exactly they are
[1:48:23.660 --> 1:48:32.300]  making the digital plug connection with this prion electrochemical magnetic connection exactly
[1:48:32.300 --> 1:48:39.260]  they are creating silicon ports for the machine interface the if if that's the first thing that
[1:48:39.260 --> 1:48:43.740]  you do when you get a new computer you have to change the hardware that's what they're doing
[1:48:43.740 --> 1:48:51.180]  they're changing our hardware to allow a biological machine and then the 5g communicates with that
[1:48:51.180 --> 1:48:56.620]  they're not trying to gmo a tomato they're not trying to gmo no it's us and then the 5g communicates
[1:48:56.620 --> 1:49:03.900]  with it this is the satanic but the the gray aliens the ones that when they take their
[1:49:03.900 --> 1:49:09.500]  micro dosing and step into the dmt world whatever and they're connecting with these people that's
[1:49:09.500 --> 1:49:13.900]  why that's why they say these are biological entities they're not they're not real they're
[1:49:13.900 --> 1:49:19.740]  soulless they're a robot but they're biologically made and they're telling them how to do this
[1:49:19.740 --> 1:49:26.620]  so that they can create us into them 100% agree that's what it is that's it and what's creepy is
[1:49:26.620 --> 1:49:32.540]  i've said they're not just with the former head of intelligence agencies and others i i talked to
[1:49:32.540 --> 1:49:36.860]  like billionaires straight up and they go yeah we know yeah and then they're all blocked off but
[1:49:36.860 --> 1:49:41.340]  the definitely the people taking orders are under full alien control which is satan
[1:49:43.660 --> 1:49:49.500]  show the 100 they show that everything from the demolish of the earth to the neural uplink to the
[1:49:49.500 --> 1:49:54.780]  the city of light when we're actually in the main frame of the computer what's on there they show
[1:49:54.780 --> 1:50:00.940]  it's called the 100 and they show everything from the destruction of the earth into a nuclear blast
[1:50:00.940 --> 1:50:06.060]  and and all the civilizations go up to space and then their spaceship's gonna die and they have to
[1:50:06.060 --> 1:50:09.580]  go back to which is which is repeated by their main eliminate transmission
[1:50:10.140 --> 1:50:15.500]  artisty clark childhoods in the same message it's it's all of it it goes into the satanic
[1:50:15.500 --> 1:50:21.180]  takeover of the of the the blood how they're coming after our blood it's it's the 100 all of it
[1:50:21.180 --> 1:50:26.780]  they they tell you they have to tell you in order to do it i agree so where is this show the 100
[1:50:27.580 --> 1:50:33.260]  it's on the wb it's a it's a super low not a lot of people watch it it started out really good
[1:50:33.260 --> 1:50:38.460]  good and then i guess they got popular and they switched cameras and director not director but
[1:50:38.460 --> 1:50:41.740]  you can tell that they kind of well no that's how it always works they make it good up front
[1:50:41.740 --> 1:50:47.340]  then yes sell it out later yeah but it shows it all the city of light the neural uplink system all
[1:50:47.340 --> 1:50:52.620]  of it merging with the machines the lady in the red dress all of it ai they even call her ali
[1:50:52.620 --> 1:51:02.140]  it's ai it's the satanic it's all there and everybody from big tech to the g7 they signed
[1:51:02.140 --> 1:51:06.540]  on to this they they think they're winners i mean look at look at claus Schwab we're gonna
[1:51:06.540 --> 1:51:14.780]  let this dude put chips in our children's heads i mean he says it they know that in order for them
[1:51:14.780 --> 1:51:20.540]  to live forever they have to kill us first well that's it you know it's like they said oh hd tv's
[1:51:20.540 --> 1:51:25.900]  coming out and everybody had an hd tv's but it's like it's like an upgrade it's like we're rewriting
[1:51:25.900 --> 1:51:31.980]  your hardware great points act thank you carlos long time caller from canada carlos led you got
[1:51:31.980 --> 1:51:40.460]  in today tell what you think of all this oh alex well um sometime back i reminded you that uh they
[1:51:40.460 --> 1:51:48.220]  were going socialist communist and that the red terror was coming well i haven't seen uh no change
[1:51:48.220 --> 1:51:54.940]  in direction and unfortunately i i'm very disappointed because i thought president trump
[1:51:54.940 --> 1:52:01.500]  knew that that he had a mission that he saw he had a had a that he had a plan and unfortunately
[1:52:01.500 --> 1:52:08.060]  he was kept from uh being able to achieve what he wanted to achieve i i think he had a plan but
[1:52:08.060 --> 1:52:16.380]  he was sorted in the process look in history there was a point at which the church and the state
[1:52:16.380 --> 1:52:23.740]  were separated it changed the world okay yeah from jesus christ uh running the world to genre
[1:52:23.740 --> 1:52:29.980]  rousseau an individual person a persona and then the republic and then there was a french revolution
[1:52:29.980 --> 1:52:37.100]  etc etc etc and now we have you know the separation from church's state which wasn't even ever a law
[1:52:37.100 --> 1:52:42.060]  it was just a comment made by jefferson on a letter to someone else but you know those who
[1:52:42.060 --> 1:52:48.460]  were interested in the individual uh power kept pushing the distinction between church and state
[1:52:48.460 --> 1:52:54.940]  what am i telling you that because we are now at the crossroads in evolution in human evolution
[1:52:54.940 --> 1:53:03.180]  where we now have to make another distinction between bank and state financial power cannot

[1:56:12.020 --> 1:56:13.020]  White male!
[1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:15.700]  So Alex Jones' whole brand is based around the idea.

[1:56:22.420 --> 1:56:23.420]  Humanity is awakening!
[1:56:23.420 --> 1:56:24.420]  Infowars.com!
[1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:25.420]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:56:25.420 --> 1:56:26.420]  The tyrants did it.
[1:56:26.420 --> 1:56:27.420]  Hemmarts of the guns.
[1:56:27.420 --> 1:56:28.420]  Stalin's of the guns.
[1:56:28.420 --> 1:56:29.420]  Malts of the guns.
[1:56:29.420 --> 1:56:38.220]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our fire on.
[1:56:38.220 --> 1:56:39.220]  Alex Jones.
[1:56:39.220 --> 1:56:40.220]  Infowars.com.
[1:56:40.220 --> 1:56:41.220]  I just don't know who you are.
[1:56:41.220 --> 1:56:42.220]  You guys know who he is?
[1:56:42.220 --> 1:56:43.220]  You know Alex Jones?
[1:56:43.220 --> 1:56:44.220]  That's Infowars.
[1:56:44.220 --> 1:56:45.220]  Very popular.
[1:56:45.220 --> 1:56:46.220]  Infowars.
[1:56:46.220 --> 1:56:48.980]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:49.980]  We need to listen to Alex Jones.
[1:56:49.980 --> 1:56:50.980]  We know we're under attack!
[1:56:50.980 --> 1:56:51.980]  We know it!
[1:56:51.980 --> 1:56:52.980]  We're breaking the conditioning!
[1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:53.980]  Ahhhh!
[1:56:53.980 --> 1:56:54.980]  Ahhhh!
[1:56:54.980 --> 1:56:55.980]  Talking about Alex Jones.
[1:56:55.980 --> 1:56:56.980]  Infowars.
[1:56:56.980 --> 1:56:57.980]  Alex Jones.
[1:56:57.980 --> 1:56:58.980]  Infowars.
[1:56:58.980 --> 1:56:59.980]  Alex Jones.
[1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:00.980]  That's just level one.
[1:57:00.980 --> 1:57:01.980]  What's level two?
[1:57:01.980 --> 1:57:02.980]  I'll tell you.
[1:57:02.980 --> 1:57:05.980]  The animated contest of Liberty is waiting for you.
[1:57:05.980 --> 1:57:10.980]  If you've got to take it your way.
[1:57:10.980 --> 1:57:14.980]  The Animated Contest of Liberty is waiting for you.
[1:57:15.980 --> 1:57:20.980]  If you've got to take it in your shoes, you've got to have the will to accept the truth,
[1:57:20.980 --> 1:57:22.980]  to fund the system, and the group collection.
[1:57:23.980 --> 1:57:26.980]  Do that, and you'll learn your way to the next level.
[1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:42.980]  This is the Info War.
[1:57:42.980 --> 1:57:47.980]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious s***.
[1:57:47.980 --> 1:57:58.980]  We're doing some serious stuff right now.
[1:57:58.980 --> 1:58:00.980]  I'll finish up with Carlos in Canada.
[1:58:00.980 --> 1:58:05.980]  Carlos, your view on where humanity is, moving Trump out of the position of whatever.
[1:58:05.980 --> 1:58:11.980]  I mean, world government, lockdowns, forced inoculations, city parks shut down in New York
[1:58:11.980 --> 1:58:13.980]  unless you've had the injections.
[1:58:13.980 --> 1:58:19.980]  I mean, total civil rights violations, total Nuremberg violation, just absolute medical tyranny.
[1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:25.980]  Carlos, what did you take on that?
[1:58:25.980 --> 1:58:29.980]  My take on that is that we're witnessing what the Russians must have felt
[1:58:29.980 --> 1:58:33.980]  when they were undertaking the Russian Revolution.
[1:58:33.980 --> 1:58:39.980]  Eventually, of course, millions died, but it was like helter skelter.
[1:58:39.980 --> 1:58:45.980]  We are finding that you turn to your judges, to your lawyers, to your defendants, and so on,
[1:58:45.980 --> 1:58:49.980]  to defend you, and you find that, you know, the district attorneys have been purchased
[1:58:49.980 --> 1:58:52.980]  and they've been bought by financial interest.
[1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:56.980]  There are people with so much money, they're bigger than entire countries.
[1:58:56.980 --> 1:59:03.980]  These people have been created by an attitude which was implemented in 1913 with the Federal Reserve,
[1:59:03.980 --> 1:59:05.980]  but it really was...
[1:59:05.980 --> 1:59:07.980]  That's exactly what I was going to start the show with today,
[1:59:07.980 --> 1:59:09.980]  and I'm going to do it the fourth hour, exactly.
[1:59:09.980 --> 1:59:14.980]  Private banks have created endless currency to buy whatever they want,
[1:59:14.980 --> 1:59:18.980]  and now that there's so much industry and so much production,
[1:59:18.980 --> 1:59:22.980]  it actually, before inflation didn't work because it would run out of goods,
[1:59:22.980 --> 1:59:24.980]  but it's actually working to some extent,
[1:59:24.980 --> 1:59:28.980]  and so exactly they could buy anybody off who is up for sale.
[1:59:28.980 --> 1:59:31.980]  So how do you get people to realize they're up for sale and to say no?
[1:59:31.980 --> 1:59:33.980]  You need to have...
[1:59:33.980 --> 1:59:37.980]  And believe me, you see the G7 when they're standing there?
[1:59:37.980 --> 1:59:42.980]  These are now plant managers with instructions to sell to you what's coming on the pipe.
[1:59:42.980 --> 1:59:45.980]  These people are no longer generating ideas.
[1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:48.980]  They're not defending the individual or the primacy of the...
[1:59:48.980 --> 1:59:50.980]  They're not leaders, they're puppets.
[1:59:50.980 --> 1:59:53.980]  Well, they're just basically going to take orders,
[1:59:53.980 --> 1:59:56.980]  and they're going to give you what they're told to do.
[1:59:56.980 --> 2:00:01.980]  Listen, Alex, if we're at the crux, we can save ourselves a lot of suffering
[2:00:01.980 --> 2:00:06.980]  by simply understanding that there is a period of inversion that we've entered
[2:00:06.980 --> 2:00:08.980]  and that we must get out of it.
[2:00:08.980 --> 2:00:11.980]  We must stress to all the leaders, number one...
[2:00:11.980 --> 2:00:14.980]  I tell you what, stay there, stay there, stay there.
[2:00:14.980 --> 2:00:17.980]  If you want to come up with 30 minutes tomorrow, commercial-free,
[2:00:17.980 --> 2:00:21.980]  we're going to air the show at 5 p.m. tomorrow,
[2:00:21.980 --> 2:00:24.980]  but I'm going to take a two-hour commercial-free show at noon tomorrow.
[2:00:24.980 --> 2:00:26.980]  You want to come on car rolls for 30 minutes tomorrow?
[2:00:26.980 --> 2:00:30.980]  I'll challenge anyone in the world to challenge me on the things I have to say.
[2:00:30.980 --> 2:00:32.980]  Alex, you're going to come on tomorrow, right?
[2:00:32.980 --> 2:00:33.980]  Yes, sir.
[2:00:33.980 --> 2:00:34.980]  Yes, sir.
[2:00:34.980 --> 2:00:36.980]  We'll call you and get him central tomorrow.
[2:00:36.980 --> 2:00:39.980]  We already got Carlos' number, but get his name and number,
[2:00:39.980 --> 2:00:41.980]  and we want to get him on tomorrow.
[2:00:41.980 --> 2:00:44.980]  Special show, 5 p.m. airs tomorrow about this.
[2:00:44.980 --> 2:00:46.980]  We got loaded phones, we got special guests.
[2:00:46.980 --> 2:00:49.980]  We got it all, baby! We're on air!
[2:00:52.980 --> 2:00:54.980]  My enemies are your enemies.
[2:00:54.980 --> 2:00:57.980]  They're the globalistic starmasks.
[2:00:57.980 --> 2:01:00.980]  They're a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles,
[2:01:00.980 --> 2:01:02.980]  control freaks, devil-worspers,
[2:01:02.980 --> 2:01:05.980]  vampires, wherever you want to call them,
[2:01:05.980 --> 2:01:07.980]  that are highly predatory
[2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:10.980]  and are setting up a false famously land system
[2:01:10.980 --> 2:01:13.980]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs,
[2:01:13.980 --> 2:01:16.980]  and electromagnetic radiation
[2:01:16.980 --> 2:01:20.980]  to change the very DNA of the human species,
[2:01:20.980 --> 2:01:23.980]  to mutate us into a form that they can control,
[2:01:23.980 --> 2:01:26.980]  like a pawn on a chessboard.
[2:01:26.980 --> 2:01:28.980]  The bottom line is they want to play God,
[2:01:28.980 --> 2:01:30.980]  they are playing God,
[2:01:30.980 --> 2:01:32.980]  and the news is only going to tighten
[2:01:32.980 --> 2:01:34.980]  around our necks from here on out.
[2:01:34.980 --> 2:01:36.980]  So many other people want to be positive,
[2:01:36.980 --> 2:01:38.980]  they want to put out fake news,
[2:01:38.980 --> 2:01:40.980]  and want to only cover limited amounts
[2:01:40.980 --> 2:01:42.980]  of what's happening with New World Order,
[2:01:42.980 --> 2:01:44.980]  but at the end of the day, it's all about the population,
[2:01:44.980 --> 2:01:46.980]  it's all about world government,
[2:01:46.980 --> 2:01:48.980]  it's all about the end of the human system,
[2:01:48.980 --> 2:01:50.980]  as we know it, and on its ashes, a nightmare being built,
[2:01:50.980 --> 2:01:57.980]  and we can turn around and stop it.
[2:02:20.980 --> 2:02:22.980]  5 p.m. Central, I will do a special,
[2:02:22.980 --> 2:02:24.980]  commercial free transmission,
[2:02:24.980 --> 2:02:26.980]  and Lord willing, I'll be back Sunday,
[2:02:26.980 --> 2:02:28.980]  4 to 6 p.m. ahead of the show.
[2:02:28.980 --> 2:02:31.980]  Oh, and Shroyer host, Sunday Live,
[2:02:31.980 --> 2:02:34.980]  6 to 8 p.m. Central.
[2:02:34.980 --> 2:02:36.980]  All right, well, I've known about these guys
[2:02:36.980 --> 2:02:38.980]  three or four years, and I've been on the show
[2:02:38.980 --> 2:02:40.980]  a couple times, and they're interesting fellows,
[2:02:40.980 --> 2:02:42.980]  they try to have fun in a cynical way
[2:02:42.980 --> 2:02:44.980]  about all this, which is a good thing to do.
[2:02:44.980 --> 2:02:46.980]  So they're with us, we'll take some calls
[2:02:46.980 --> 2:02:48.980]  as well this hour from Jack and James
[2:02:48.980 --> 2:02:50.980]  and Max and Patrick and Marty and John
[2:02:50.980 --> 2:02:52.980]  and Scott, Jim and Craig,
[2:02:52.980 --> 2:02:54.980]  and after our guests are gone, I'll continue on
[2:02:54.980 --> 2:02:56.980]  to the fourth hour, and I haven't hit the big news
[2:02:56.980 --> 2:02:58.980]  about the global social credit score
[2:02:58.980 --> 2:03:00.980]  that's been announced by Apple,
[2:03:00.980 --> 2:03:02.980]  and by the IMF that if you don't turn
[2:03:02.980 --> 2:03:04.980]  your five-year-old over to pedophile
[2:03:04.980 --> 2:03:06.980]  literally at Dragwing Storytime,
[2:03:06.980 --> 2:03:10.980]  I'm not joking, you'll have her bank account taken away.
[2:03:10.980 --> 2:03:12.980]  So they've announced the plan,
[2:03:12.980 --> 2:03:16.980]  we've got it right here from the IMF working paper,
[2:03:16.980 --> 2:03:18.980]  and it ties into all this, so
[2:03:18.980 --> 2:03:20.980]  you think the social justice warriors
[2:03:20.980 --> 2:03:22.980]  just are censoring the internet now?
[2:03:22.980 --> 2:03:24.980]  You think they're just sending pedophiles to your school?
[2:03:24.980 --> 2:03:26.980]  These people mean
[2:03:26.980 --> 2:03:28.980]  madness, and they mean total
[2:03:28.980 --> 2:03:30.980]  domination to get you to turn your body over,
[2:03:30.980 --> 2:03:32.980]  parks shut down in New York,
[2:03:32.980 --> 2:03:34.980]  if you haven't had inoculations,
[2:03:34.980 --> 2:03:36.980]  just totally legal revolution taking place.
[2:03:36.980 --> 2:03:38.980]  All right, Revenge of the Sith,
[2:03:38.980 --> 2:03:40.980]  not the Sith, the Sith, C-I-S,
[2:03:40.980 --> 2:03:42.980]  is Royce Lopez
[2:03:42.980 --> 2:03:44.980]  and Mike Marsh, and they're here
[2:03:44.980 --> 2:03:46.980]  with us right now
[2:03:46.980 --> 2:03:48.980]  to talk about their view of the world,
[2:03:48.980 --> 2:03:50.980]  their view of Bill Gates
[2:03:50.980 --> 2:03:52.980]  wanting to be our doctor,
[2:03:52.980 --> 2:03:54.980]  censorship, all of it.
[2:03:54.980 --> 2:03:56.980]  So guys, good to have you here.
[2:03:56.980 --> 2:03:58.980]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[2:03:58.980 --> 2:04:00.980]  We'll just unload on me,
[2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:02.980]  because you were saying some great stuff yesterday,
[2:04:02.980 --> 2:04:04.980]  both Marsh and both Royce
[2:04:04.980 --> 2:04:06.980]  with what you were talking about
[2:04:06.980 --> 2:04:08.980]  with just all the craziness
[2:04:08.980 --> 2:04:10.980]  that's unfolding,
[2:04:10.980 --> 2:04:14.980]  and just where this dystopia is going.
[2:04:14.980 --> 2:04:16.980]  Well, can I start by saying that
[2:04:16.980 --> 2:04:18.980]  if you'll notice here, I have this really beautiful
[2:04:18.980 --> 2:04:20.980]  big monitor behind me that is now not working
[2:04:20.980 --> 2:04:22.980]  because of the
[2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:24.980]  latest Windows update.
[2:04:24.980 --> 2:04:26.980]  So the guy
[2:04:26.980 --> 2:04:28.980]  that made my screen not work
[2:04:28.980 --> 2:04:30.980]  with his nonstop updates
[2:04:30.980 --> 2:04:32.980]  also wants to rewrite my RNA.
[2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:34.980]  So I have a problem with that,
[2:04:34.980 --> 2:04:36.980]  I think.
[2:04:36.980 --> 2:04:38.980]  But you're not allowed to criticize
[2:04:38.980 --> 2:04:40.980]  UN approved spokesman,
[2:04:40.980 --> 2:04:42.980]  so do not try to say
[2:04:42.980 --> 2:04:44.980]  you don't love Bill Gates, that's not allowed.
[2:04:44.980 --> 2:04:46.980]  Well, yeah, but let's say,
[2:04:46.980 --> 2:04:48.980]  let's...
[2:04:48.980 --> 2:04:50.980]  You're allowed now,
[2:04:50.980 --> 2:04:52.980]  because something happened, Bill Gates decided
[2:04:52.980 --> 2:04:54.980]  I'm not going to play ball,
[2:04:54.980 --> 2:04:56.980]  or maybe they're sending him a message
[2:04:56.980 --> 2:04:58.980]  like we talked about yesterday,
[2:04:58.980 --> 2:05:00.980]  but man, did they throw him under the bus quickly?
[2:05:00.980 --> 2:05:02.980]  Well, that's right.
[2:05:02.980 --> 2:05:04.980]  That's a good discussion.
[2:05:04.980 --> 2:05:06.980]  Why do you think Bill Gates has fallen
[2:05:06.980 --> 2:05:08.980]  down?
[2:05:08.980 --> 2:05:10.980]  Maybe he tried to roll out his
[2:05:10.980 --> 2:05:12.980]  Simpsons Mr. Burns plan
[2:05:12.980 --> 2:05:14.980]  to blot out the sun a little too early.
[2:05:14.980 --> 2:05:16.980]  Maybe he jumped the gun on that one.
[2:05:16.980 --> 2:05:18.980]  It is...
[2:05:18.980 --> 2:05:20.980]  That was the point you were making yesterday, Merch,
[2:05:20.980 --> 2:05:22.980]  was he wants to block the sun out,
[2:05:22.980 --> 2:05:24.980]  he wants to kill me, he says he does,
[2:05:24.980 --> 2:05:26.980]  now he wants to inject me.
[2:05:26.980 --> 2:05:28.980]  I mean, why?
[2:05:28.980 --> 2:05:30.980]  It's like, well, I'm coming to forcibly inject you.
[2:05:30.980 --> 2:05:32.980]  By the way, I think you should die.
[2:05:32.980 --> 2:05:34.980]  I want to block the sun out, by the way.
[2:05:34.980 --> 2:05:36.980]  Do your rant on that, guys.
[2:05:36.980 --> 2:05:38.980]  Well, I mean, yeah, the Simpsons did
[2:05:38.980 --> 2:05:40.980]  an episode where Mr. Burns wanted to
[2:05:40.980 --> 2:05:42.980]  block out the sun. That episode of the Simpsons
[2:05:42.980 --> 2:05:44.980]  was written to illustrate
[2:05:44.980 --> 2:05:46.980]  how evil Mr. Burns was.
[2:05:46.980 --> 2:05:48.980]  And then here we are 20 years later
[2:05:48.980 --> 2:05:50.980]  and they're like, how cool is it?
[2:05:50.980 --> 2:05:52.980]  Bill Gates wants to block out the sun to cool down the planet.
[2:05:52.980 --> 2:05:54.980]  Yeah, it's all the whole thing.
[2:05:54.980 --> 2:05:56.980]  The thing we said yesterday
[2:05:56.980 --> 2:05:58.980]  that I think Alex enjoyed was the fact
[2:05:58.980 --> 2:06:00.980]  that whether it's Bill Gates, Jack Dorsey,
[2:06:00.980 --> 2:06:02.980]  the people at YouTube,
[2:06:02.980 --> 2:06:04.980]  all these people that are censoring us,
[2:06:04.980 --> 2:06:06.980]  every single one of them shares
[2:06:06.980 --> 2:06:08.980]  one thing in common.
[2:06:08.980 --> 2:06:10.980]  And that is the fact that
[2:06:10.980 --> 2:06:12.980]  for most of our lives,
[2:06:12.980 --> 2:06:14.980]  we would have stuffed people like this into a locker.
[2:06:14.980 --> 2:06:16.980]  And this is their way
[2:06:16.980 --> 2:06:18.980]  of stuffing us in a locker.
[2:06:18.980 --> 2:06:20.980]  It's the only way they can is by owning
[2:06:20.980 --> 2:06:22.980]  the public discourse and basically
[2:06:22.980 --> 2:06:24.980]  silencing us.
[2:06:24.980 --> 2:06:26.980]  And I don't think I've said anything
[2:06:26.980 --> 2:06:28.980]  particularly crazy or dangerous.
[2:06:28.980 --> 2:06:30.980]  I don't think you've said anything particularly
[2:06:30.980 --> 2:06:32.980]  or anything we've said has been perfectly reasonable.
[2:06:32.980 --> 2:06:34.980]  We've been smeared
[2:06:34.980 --> 2:06:36.980]  as anti-science
[2:06:36.980 --> 2:06:38.980]  and science deniers and terrorists
[2:06:38.980 --> 2:06:40.980]  and really simply
[2:06:40.980 --> 2:06:42.980]  just for being skeptical
[2:06:42.980 --> 2:06:44.980]  of injecting fetal tissue
[2:06:44.980 --> 2:06:46.980]  and rewriting our RNA
[2:06:46.980 --> 2:06:48.980]  based on
[2:06:48.980 --> 2:06:50.980]  a year old vaccine.
[2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:52.980]  I'm sorry, again, the guy who was involved
[2:06:52.980 --> 2:06:54.980]  in designing the vaccine.
[2:06:54.980 --> 2:06:56.980]  Imagine if this monitor behind me were my kidneys.
[2:06:56.980 --> 2:06:58.980]  Sorry, I'm not interested.
[2:06:58.980 --> 2:07:00.980]  And then
[2:07:00.980 --> 2:07:02.980]  you have people telling you
[2:07:02.980 --> 2:07:04.980]  that whenever Rand Paul says something
[2:07:04.980 --> 2:07:06.980]  who's a doc, by the way, when after Fauci
[2:07:06.980 --> 2:07:08.980]  he's like, you know, I honestly think
[2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:10.980]  you're wearing this mask a show
[2:07:10.980 --> 2:07:12.980]  to go, oh, Rand Paul, what do you know?
[2:07:12.980 --> 2:07:14.980]  But then it's like, hey, this Bill Gates
[2:07:14.980 --> 2:07:16.980]  Mr. Computer Guy, oh, by the way
[2:07:16.980 --> 2:07:18.980]  stole all of his stuff.
[2:07:18.980 --> 2:07:20.980]  He just stole all of his stuff from other people.
[2:07:20.980 --> 2:07:22.980]  Let's listen to him because
[2:07:22.980 --> 2:07:24.980]  he's going to buy all the farmland and destroy it
[2:07:24.980 --> 2:07:26.980]  and just kill half the people in Africa
[2:07:26.980 --> 2:07:28.980]  because there's so many people on the planet.
[2:07:28.980 --> 2:07:30.980]  But make sure you download the new version of Skype.
[2:07:32.980 --> 2:07:34.980]  Exactly. So maybe
[2:07:34.980 --> 2:07:36.980]  they woke up and said the guy that wants to kill
[2:07:36.980 --> 2:07:38.980]  old people and black people maybe
[2:07:38.980 --> 2:07:40.980]  shouldn't be the spokesperson for our forced
[2:07:40.980 --> 2:07:42.980]  injection.
[2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:44.980]  Yeah.
[2:07:44.980 --> 2:07:46.980]  They need to find
[2:07:46.980 --> 2:07:48.980]  some more charismatic people
[2:07:48.980 --> 2:07:50.980]  because Fauci and Gates aren't cutting it
[2:07:50.980 --> 2:07:52.980]  and I think they just
[2:07:52.980 --> 2:07:54.980]  they need to find less
[2:07:54.980 --> 2:07:56.980]  off-putting people. Well, that's a fun
[2:07:56.980 --> 2:07:58.980]  that's a fun thing to have in a sick macabre
[2:07:58.980 --> 2:08:00.980]  black comedy satire way
[2:08:00.980 --> 2:08:02.980]  who should be the spokesperson for
[2:08:02.980 --> 2:08:04.980]  Satan for the dehumanization
[2:08:04.980 --> 2:08:06.980]  depopulation of planet? Who should
[2:08:06.980 --> 2:08:08.980]  it be? Mr. Rogers is dead
[2:08:08.980 --> 2:08:10.980]  Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse
[2:08:10.980 --> 2:08:12.980]  who should we
[2:08:12.980 --> 2:08:14.980]  who's living a real character, a real
[2:08:14.980 --> 2:08:16.980]  person? Who should be the spokesperson
[2:08:16.980 --> 2:08:18.980]  for planetary death?
[2:08:18.980 --> 2:08:20.980]  I mean, get somebody more charismatic
[2:08:20.980 --> 2:08:22.980]  is what I say. I got the rock
[2:08:22.980 --> 2:08:24.980]  Dwayne Rock Johnson
[2:08:24.980 --> 2:08:26.980]  Dwayne Johnson says kill yourself
[2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:28.980]  for Earth. There you go.
[2:08:28.980 --> 2:08:30.980]  Yeah, exactly. And then he
[2:08:30.980 --> 2:08:32.980]  have this whole campaign like the rock says only
[2:08:32.980 --> 2:08:34.980]  half of your kids need to live. It'll be perfect.
[2:08:34.980 --> 2:08:36.980]  It's crazy. Like all my
[2:08:36.980 --> 2:08:38.980]  girlfriends are like really obsessed with rock.
[2:08:38.980 --> 2:08:40.980]  I was like, what guy would you like more than me? Well, I like the rock
[2:08:40.980 --> 2:08:42.980]  like, wow, I've got me and my wife
[2:08:42.980 --> 2:08:44.980]  and eight girlfriends. I'm joking. The point is
[2:08:44.980 --> 2:08:46.980]  is women do like the rock. He's got that
[2:08:46.980 --> 2:08:48.980]  likable thing about him.
[2:08:48.980 --> 2:08:50.980]  I asked one that I go who do you think is the most sexy man
[2:08:50.980 --> 2:08:52.980]  in the rock. The rock was John Connery 30
[2:08:52.980 --> 2:08:54.980]  years ago. So it was
[2:08:54.980 --> 2:08:56.980]  Mel Gibson maybe. So yeah, the rock
[2:08:56.980 --> 2:08:58.980]  should be Satan's spokesperson.
[2:08:58.980 --> 2:09:00.980]  Yeah, you can come out and be like, do you smell
[2:09:00.980 --> 2:09:02.980]  what the rock is cooking? And we can be like, yeah,
[2:09:02.980 --> 2:09:04.980]  Bell's palsy. I don't want it. Thank you.
[2:09:04.980 --> 2:09:06.980]  That
[2:09:06.980 --> 2:09:08.980]  that or John Cena because you're already good at apologizing
[2:09:08.980 --> 2:09:10.980]  to China. I mean, the guys are already
[2:09:10.980 --> 2:09:12.980]  set up.
[2:09:12.980 --> 2:09:14.980]  But how would you be able to promote
[2:09:14.980 --> 2:09:16.980]  I'm not gay, but you know, the rock could sell me some
[2:09:16.980 --> 2:09:18.980]  things. But John Cena just
[2:09:18.980 --> 2:09:20.980]  comes off as a guy that will rape your dog.
[2:09:20.980 --> 2:09:22.980]  Yeah, I don't know, man.
[2:09:22.980 --> 2:09:24.980]  Everybody always talks about this John Cena guy,
[2:09:24.980 --> 2:09:26.980]  but I don't see anything.
[2:09:26.980 --> 2:09:28.980]  Okay, see, that's not, you know,
[2:09:28.980 --> 2:09:30.980]  come on, this is the big time.
[2:09:30.980 --> 2:09:32.980]  No bad jokes.
[2:09:32.980 --> 2:09:34.980]  John Cena.
[2:09:34.980 --> 2:09:36.980]  John Cena is a good example. The rock,
[2:09:36.980 --> 2:09:38.980]  you know, we talk about the rock, but
[2:09:38.980 --> 2:09:40.980]  let's be honest, the rock is
[2:09:40.980 --> 2:09:42.980]  positioning himself to run for some sort of public
[2:09:42.980 --> 2:09:44.980]  office. He's been doing it for a while.
[2:09:44.980 --> 2:09:46.980]  So between him and
[2:09:46.980 --> 2:09:48.980]  Matthew McConaughey, I'll take the rock over
[2:09:48.980 --> 2:09:50.980]  the coke at any day.
[2:09:50.980 --> 2:09:52.980]  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, mostly
[2:09:52.980 --> 2:09:54.980]  mostly because
[2:09:54.980 --> 2:09:56.980]  the rock, like you said, at least he's charismatic
[2:09:56.980 --> 2:09:58.980]  and kind of funny.
[2:09:58.980 --> 2:10:00.980]  But the rock is John Cena.
[2:10:00.980 --> 2:10:02.980]  I actually hate John Cena.
[2:10:02.980 --> 2:10:04.980]  What was kind of an odd
[2:10:04.980 --> 2:10:06.980]  that's an odd one. Like I can understand
[2:10:06.980 --> 2:10:08.980]  not liking over the hating him is very
[2:10:08.980 --> 2:10:10.980]  I don't know. I just I've always kind of
[2:10:10.980 --> 2:10:12.980]  just been like, I guess I don't like
[2:10:12.980 --> 2:10:14.980]  him now that he's like groveling and
[2:10:14.980 --> 2:10:16.980]  like, you know, sucking up to China and
[2:10:16.980 --> 2:10:18.980]  you know, learning Mandarin.
[2:10:18.980 --> 2:10:20.980]  I guess he must have
[2:10:20.980 --> 2:10:22.980]  he must have some sort of early
[2:10:22.980 --> 2:10:24.980]  morning knowledge of something coming.
[2:10:28.980 --> 2:10:30.980]  At least he picked, honestly, at least he picked
[2:10:30.980 --> 2:10:32.980]  the smart Asian language. Like, you know, most
[2:10:32.980 --> 2:10:34.980]  people learn Japanese, but it's like
[2:10:34.980 --> 2:10:36.980]  you want to be ready.
[2:10:36.980 --> 2:10:38.980]  You want to be ready for the future.
[2:10:38.980 --> 2:10:40.980]  Yeah.
[2:10:44.980 --> 2:10:46.980]  More convenient soon, though.
[2:10:46.980 --> 2:10:48.980]  John Cena does actually have a
[2:10:48.980 --> 2:10:50.980]  movie coming out with Jackie Chan.
[2:10:50.980 --> 2:10:52.980]  So I read that that was part of the reason
[2:10:52.980 --> 2:10:54.980]  he was apologizing so hard.
[2:10:54.980 --> 2:10:56.980]  And Jackie Chan was a spectacular
[2:10:56.980 --> 2:10:58.980]  beard.
[2:10:58.980 --> 2:11:00.980]  Thank you so much. I grew up myself.
[2:11:00.980 --> 2:11:02.980]  Appreciate it.
[2:11:02.980 --> 2:11:04.980]  My wife hates it.
[2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:06.980]  Wait, I'm sorry, but isn't Jackie Chan from
[2:11:06.980 --> 2:11:08.980]  Hong Kong?
[2:11:10.980 --> 2:11:12.980]  You mean Hong Kong, one of the city
[2:11:12.980 --> 2:11:14.980]  states of China? Mike, I don't want you to
[2:11:14.980 --> 2:11:16.980]  apologize later to China.
[2:11:16.980 --> 2:11:18.980]  I don't name Hong Kong Hong Kong be China.
[2:11:18.980 --> 2:11:20.980]  Yeah, they're all serious.
[2:11:20.980 --> 2:11:22.980]  Let's get serious and stop right now.
[2:11:22.980 --> 2:11:24.980]  I want to talk about the stuff you guys
[2:11:24.980 --> 2:11:26.980]  just mentioned.
[2:11:26.980 --> 2:11:28.980]  The World ID New York
[2:11:28.980 --> 2:11:30.980]  got to have an injection to go to the park.
[2:11:30.980 --> 2:11:32.980]  That's like a scale of one to 10 10
[2:11:32.980 --> 2:11:34.980]  on the tyranny scale.
[2:11:34.980 --> 2:11:36.980]  I don't know if you guys where you think
[2:11:36.980 --> 2:11:38.980]  the world's going and how we fight back
[2:11:38.980 --> 2:11:40.980]  or do we marry Bill Gates?
[2:11:40.980 --> 2:11:42.980]  Maybe could I marry him?
[2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:44.980]  Maybe I could be Mrs. Alexandra
[2:11:44.980 --> 2:11:46.980]  Bill Gates, the third?
[2:11:46.980 --> 2:11:48.980]  Yeah, I mean, that second divorce
[2:11:48.980 --> 2:11:50.980]  could still clean him out.
[2:11:50.980 --> 2:11:52.980]  He's got a good $3 million
[2:11:52.980 --> 2:11:54.980]  divorce.
[2:11:54.980 --> 2:11:56.980]  Your voice counts.

[2:11:58.980 --> 2:12:00.980]  over the internet or in person,
[2:12:00.980 --> 2:12:02.980]  it changes the world. The globalists
[2:12:02.980 --> 2:12:04.980]  in China is unpopular.
[2:12:04.980 --> 2:12:06.980]  They know you're angry.

[2:12:52.980 --> 2:12:54.980]  Big Pharma was born out of the
[2:12:54.980 --> 2:12:56.980]  Rockefeller oil industry
[2:12:56.980 --> 2:12:58.980]  in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[2:12:58.980 --> 2:13:00.980]  The petrochemical
[2:13:00.980 --> 2:13:02.980]  then dominated two major
[2:13:02.980 --> 2:13:04.980]  industries, plastics and drugs.
[2:13:04.980 --> 2:13:06.980]  Companies began
[2:13:06.980 --> 2:13:08.980]  synthesizing patented versions
[2:13:08.980 --> 2:13:10.980]  of naturally sourced drugs.
[2:13:10.980 --> 2:13:12.980]  The natural sources were then
[2:13:12.980 --> 2:13:14.980]  made illegal. Pharmaceuticals
[2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:16.980]  became medicine.
[2:13:16.980 --> 2:13:18.980]  And the sicker people got, the more their
[2:13:18.980 --> 2:13:20.980]  industry grew. It's a death cult
[2:13:20.980 --> 2:13:22.980]  and it's up to the individual to
[2:13:22.980 --> 2:13:24.980]  escape. Good health begins

[2:15:20.980 --> 2:15:22.980]  Look at the show.
[2:15:22.980 --> 2:15:24.980]  Cheers.
[2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:30.980]  So!
[2:15:30.980 --> 2:15:32.980]  You tubers, podcasters are here
[2:15:32.980 --> 2:15:34.980]  with us. It's important to have
[2:15:34.980 --> 2:15:36.980]  folks on that are on youtube that
[2:15:36.980 --> 2:15:38.980]  aren't cowards and actually have me
[2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:40.980]  on. I was on their show yesterday
[2:15:40.980 --> 2:15:42.980]  of course I got shadow bed.
[2:15:42.980 --> 2:15:44.980]  But gentlemen,
[2:15:44.980 --> 2:15:46.980]  I could ask the questions i can make
[2:15:46.980 --> 2:15:48.980]  the statements here. I can talk all day long
[2:15:48.980 --> 2:15:52.320]  What do you make of this time and place and world we're in?
[2:15:52.980 --> 2:15:58.620]  Where about I keep saying oh, it's Alex Jones is timeline now not something my timeline anybody can research this and see what's coming next
[2:15:58.860 --> 2:16:02.960]  What do you make the world we're in and where is it going? I mean, what's your predictions?
[2:16:03.620 --> 2:16:05.620]  Well, we talked about a little
[2:16:05.780 --> 2:16:08.260]  Sorry about that Mike. We talked a little bit yesterday on the show
[2:16:08.660 --> 2:16:15.780]  My my my worry is is that with everything being shut down and everything and nobody able to get any information
[2:16:15.780 --> 2:16:23.340]  The issue is is that we're gonna have an entire generation of people that are just gonna think this is just the way he
[2:16:23.580 --> 2:16:27.900]  It way it is, you know, hey a bat, you know, but mean words are now violence
[2:16:27.900 --> 2:16:33.540]  You know people should not be allowed to make a living because they said something that I don't like that's what I see and that's me
[2:16:33.540 --> 2:16:39.180]  It's the scariest part. No, no, you're right. It's the tyranny of the left. I mean, I have articles here
[2:16:40.300 --> 2:16:43.220]  Where a woman was cleared in college
[2:16:43.220 --> 2:16:48.540]  Student who says university investigator her for saying women have vaginas clear
[2:16:49.740 --> 2:16:56.460]  So if you say birds fly in the sky and the water is wet and women have vaginas you you get called up on charges
[2:16:58.380 --> 2:17:04.420]  Yeah, I do have to say too, it's a little unfair to call this the Alex Jones time line. That's like
[2:17:05.820 --> 2:17:11.940]  That would be like calling OJ's trial the Nicole Brown Simpson trial, you know, and I mean, it's that you aren't the one
[2:17:11.940 --> 2:17:16.540]  It's not like you were waving pom-poms and trying to usher in this area. You've been warning about the era
[2:17:16.540 --> 2:17:18.700]  I wouldn't exactly pin the name on you. I
[2:17:19.980 --> 2:17:24.860]  Mean, I agree, but it's getting crazy. So what do you what do you see next is it's such a dystopia
[2:17:24.860 --> 2:17:29.940]  It's like the the globalist went hey everything that doesn't work everything evil. Let's just do it
[2:17:31.500 --> 2:17:37.340]  I'll tell you this I am known to be a pretty lazy guy who likes to drink and sit on my
[2:17:37.820 --> 2:17:39.820]  Fat butt and not too much
[2:17:39.820 --> 2:17:43.620]  I've been going to the gym five days a week now for over a month
[2:17:44.740 --> 2:17:48.660]  I've been going to the gun range pretty much once twice a week now
[2:17:48.660 --> 2:17:53.820]  And I'm not the kind of guy that used to like I'm taking first aid classes now. These are not things
[2:17:53.820 --> 2:17:58.020]  I'm and I'm against you didn't consciously do that your body's doing it, isn't it?
[2:17:58.820 --> 2:18:04.460]  Yeah, it's just me going like I don't want to be useless if something bad happens
[2:18:04.460 --> 2:18:08.620]  It's I'm not going crazy and I'm not like doomsday prepping or anything
[2:18:08.620 --> 2:18:12.380]  But I'm just like yeah, I need to be able to run a mile without feeling like I'm going to die
[2:18:12.380 --> 2:18:15.380]  I need to be able to turn a kit somebody if they're bleeding
[2:18:15.380 --> 2:18:20.620]  I want to be able to you know shoot center mass every time picking up and intellectually picking up. What's coming soon?
[2:18:21.620 --> 2:18:29.580]  Yeah, I mean again if I'm doing these things then I can't imagine anybody else still just being asleep at this point
[2:18:29.580 --> 2:18:34.220]  Exactly, I'm the same way. I'm like putting in solar panels drilling wells doing push-ups
[2:18:34.220 --> 2:18:38.620]  Not planning anything offensive, but like you can pick it up. It's coming. Oh
[2:18:39.620 --> 2:18:41.620]  Yeah, I mean I
[2:18:41.820 --> 2:18:45.620]  I've never been a guy either that with that, you know, if you would ask me even 10 years ago
[2:18:45.620 --> 2:18:49.820]  Hey, would you be somebody that has a go bag by the front door with MREs in it and stuff?
[2:18:49.820 --> 2:18:55.220]  I'd be like, ah, that's crazy stuff. Why would ever do that now? I have that now? I'm ready and and you know
[2:18:55.220 --> 2:18:58.420]  You know before they be like, oh, you're the crazy one. You're you're nuts
[2:18:58.420 --> 2:19:03.420]  But then when you see cities burning down, you know and you see and you see you know
[2:19:03.420 --> 2:19:08.180]  You see and you see everything around you crumbling and when you can't even go on Twitter and go
[2:19:08.180 --> 2:19:13.860]  Hey guys, is anyone else worried without being called the bigot? You start going, you know what forget everybody else
[2:19:13.860 --> 2:19:15.940]  What are we still people? Everyone's always fighting online
[2:19:15.940 --> 2:19:22.020]  But I think a lot of people go take care of your family take care of the people around you and have a plan
[2:19:22.020 --> 2:19:27.660]  Look, maybe we'll get lucky and nothing bad happens. Maybe I keep hearing all the pendulum's gonna swing the other way
[2:19:27.660 --> 2:19:30.220]  I don't see it because it looks like they've stopped the clock
[2:19:30.220 --> 2:19:34.220]  But let's say it doesn't you want to be ready to go. No, I agree
[2:19:34.540 --> 2:19:39.900]  They've artificially blocked the pendulum swinging back people you want. Oh, don't worry the pills. No, no instead
[2:19:39.900 --> 2:19:42.220]  They actually didn't pause it. They push it back the other way
[2:19:43.220 --> 2:19:44.460]  Mm-hmm
[2:19:44.460 --> 2:19:50.220]  Yeah, and then if you say if you say look the clock's not working they call you a racist and kick you off of YouTube
[2:19:51.740 --> 2:19:55.220]  Yeah, it's I think the situation is just rapidly
[2:19:55.220 --> 2:20:02.540]  Deteriorating and again, I'm not that the kind of guy that's gonna, you know be paranoid and I still enjoy my life
[2:20:02.540 --> 2:20:05.660]  I go out to dinner. I you know, I go out with friends Royce the same way
[2:20:06.780 --> 2:20:09.900]  I'm like, why are you cloud swab assholes doing this?
[2:20:11.060 --> 2:20:15.980]  Exactly, but if again, I'm a pretty lazy guy and if I'm now starting to work on myself
[2:20:16.300 --> 2:20:21.220]  That should snap a lot of people out of it and make them say wow if if merch is getting off his ass
[2:20:21.220 --> 2:20:25.100]  And he's scared. Maybe we should be a little nervous
[2:20:25.900 --> 2:20:29.460]  So worst-case scenario, what do you guys see happening versus best case?
[2:20:31.660 --> 2:20:33.660]  I mean, well, I mean
[2:20:33.980 --> 2:20:38.460]  Yeah, go ahead Mike. Sorry a little bit of delay. No, I mean, I was not just it to me
[2:20:38.460 --> 2:20:40.460]  I kind of think a thing I was I
[2:20:40.740 --> 2:20:45.460]  I'm I and I'm a little resistant to this because I am a bit of an agnostic
[2:20:45.460 --> 2:20:50.300]  but you know, I was raised Christian and I start to think of this and in biblical terms and
[2:20:50.300 --> 2:20:52.300]  you know
[2:20:52.540 --> 2:20:56.980]  There's a very firm belief in almost any religion that the last chapter is not very pleasant
[2:20:57.620 --> 2:21:03.820]  For us here on earth. So and if you pick any religion, I mean every religion has a last chapter. So I
[2:21:04.540 --> 2:21:07.100]  Don't know. I it's it's definitely scary
[2:21:07.100 --> 2:21:09.100]  I definitely don't want it to be the end
[2:21:09.100 --> 2:21:14.140]  But if it is I want to stick around and kind of see how the whole story wraps up
[2:21:14.140 --> 2:21:18.380]  Well, let's be clear plow swab Bill Gates say they're having a final chapter for us
[2:21:18.380 --> 2:21:23.620]  So whether it is the final chapter, they're trying to play God because they know a final chapter is coming
[2:21:23.620 --> 2:21:27.100]  They're trying to initiate it now to be in control of it. Does that make sense? Oh
[2:21:28.140 --> 2:21:32.740]  Yeah, I mean absolutely and you know, you know, when you when you when you talk about you know
[2:21:32.740 --> 2:21:36.940]  When I went to Christian height Christian school my whole life and be like the end of times
[2:21:36.940 --> 2:21:39.780]  It's gonna be you know, these demons and the whole world's gonna fall apart
[2:21:39.780 --> 2:21:45.820]  I think what we're seeing is something that is is scarier and what about I mean by that is if you would have thought
[2:21:45.820 --> 2:21:50.300]  You know, I'm gonna arm myself up and I'm gonna I'm gonna physically fight these people. Sure. You could do that
[2:21:50.660 --> 2:21:54.540]  but they're winning in a way that you can't fight back because
[2:21:55.860 --> 2:21:58.780]  Controlling the flow of information is way
[2:21:58.780 --> 2:22:02.600]  They make your children mentally ill and give you cancer. They don't physically fight you. They just yeah
[2:22:03.180 --> 2:22:07.900]  Yeah, we went out when I bring it when I bring up. Hey, maybe we shouldn't be castrating six year olds
[2:22:07.900 --> 2:22:11.340]  They say oh wow you big it and you're like, no, but wait a second
[2:22:11.340 --> 2:22:14.660]  That was a normal opinion that you should be allowed to have you know
[2:22:14.660 --> 2:22:19.700]  When I was a kid during the you know used to watch wrestling right and all the kid and all the wrestlers would take steroids
[2:22:19.700 --> 2:22:21.620]  Right like and they would have all these things like, you know
[2:22:21.620 --> 2:22:24.860]  Hulk Hogan let the kids down because they found out he took steroids now
[2:22:24.980 --> 2:22:30.260]  They're giving steroids to five-year-olds and going. This is normal. This is normal girls
[2:22:31.260 --> 2:22:33.260]  five-year-old girls
[2:22:36.300 --> 2:22:37.700]  This thing this is normal
[2:22:37.700 --> 2:22:43.460]  This is the way life is now a total abandonment of everything we know that works and just turning evil loose
[2:22:43.460 --> 2:22:50.660]  Yeah, like my mother my mother went to church and my mother wouldn't even let me get a tattoo or an eyebrow ring until I was
[2:22:50.980 --> 2:22:55.740]  Out of her house and I was of age and that's what six-year-olds balls off gentlemen

[2:25:10.060 --> 2:25:14.140]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called
[2:25:14.140 --> 2:25:22.220]  But since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old
[2:25:22.780 --> 2:25:23.660]  and
[2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:27.260]  I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought you know well
[2:25:27.260 --> 2:25:30.820]  Maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[2:25:31.140 --> 2:25:36.540]  But when I started taking it me doesn't happen immediately, but you know over a period of time
[2:25:36.540 --> 2:25:42.340]  I started noticing. Okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful, you know
[2:25:42.340 --> 2:25:46.380]  I don't I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know
[2:25:46.380 --> 2:25:51.180]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin

[2:27:07.340 --> 2:27:12.300]  We have being given free will being given free will being given consciousness is
[2:27:13.020 --> 2:27:16.420]  literally the seed of an entire universe an entire
[2:27:16.980 --> 2:27:22.220]  System and the fact that you're able to commune with God the fact you're able to see the beauty of the sunset
[2:27:22.220 --> 2:27:28.620]  Or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your wife your husband the beauty of your child learning knowledge
[2:27:28.620 --> 2:27:33.700]  The beauty of music the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic
[2:27:34.140 --> 2:27:40.060]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship. So don't worship the globalist

[2:27:43.260 --> 2:27:49.580]  But worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate pre-speech
[2:27:49.820 --> 2:27:52.180]  While you still have it while you still have it
[2:27:52.180 --> 2:27:58.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:28:22.180 --> 2:28:24.180]  Listen everybody always is calling in
[2:28:24.580 --> 2:28:31.100]  You said they were taking text messages or comments on YouTube about asking questions about this or that or I'm told by the mason's of the CIA
[2:28:31.540 --> 2:28:34.620]  I'm not bragging. Let me get something straight to all those couple guys. I
[2:28:35.700 --> 2:28:38.580]  Create the original content that people respond to
[2:28:39.060 --> 2:28:42.900]  I'm not getting orders from anybody. I don't have these guests on and tell them what to talk about
[2:28:42.900 --> 2:28:47.340]  I don't tell my reporters what to do. I think somebody's interesting. I have on the show. I
[2:28:47.780 --> 2:28:49.940]  Don't have to defend myself from critics
[2:28:49.940 --> 2:28:53.620]  I just want critics to get out of their mother's basements and
[2:28:54.180 --> 2:29:00.940]  Actually realize that there's a whole world out there and most of it's not controlled the whole world government the whole UN
[2:29:01.100 --> 2:29:04.540]  Takeover the whole cashless society medical ID
[2:29:04.900 --> 2:29:11.540]  Social credit score is about getting us control. We're not controlled and the good thing is we're not controlled
[2:29:11.540 --> 2:29:14.300]  That's what I want to promote
[2:29:14.300 --> 2:29:20.260]  And so I'm not trying to brag or to my horn or anything. It's just that the last thing like like it's like
[2:29:20.260 --> 2:29:27.460]  Oh, I'll get my orders from a CIA. Oh, but like I wouldn't want that like that's like this higher group. Let me explain
[2:29:28.260 --> 2:29:30.760]  The CIA calls up and ask me what I think I
[2:29:31.340 --> 2:29:34.660]  Mean and I'm like the CIA doesn't know anything. It's like a joke
[2:29:34.700 --> 2:29:42.060]  It's had all its power transferred to private corporations the Carnegie endowment the Ford endowment the Bill Gates endowment that runs the show and
[2:29:42.060 --> 2:29:49.500]  Those people want me off air. So I don't mean to go into a rant gentlemen, but what are you guys talking to the Revenge of the Sith co-hosts here?
[2:29:50.140 --> 2:29:54.700]  Just the rant you want to get out to two million people because most people brag about their audience as an exaggeration
[2:29:54.700 --> 2:30:02.300]  No, I'm not exaggerating. We got two million people an hour real people tune in across the world conservatively world leaders intelligence agencies
[2:30:02.340 --> 2:30:05.020]  Hell the Easter Bunny's probably listening to Santa Claus
[2:30:05.020 --> 2:30:08.900]  But seriously, what do you want to impart to people about the nature of the world and where we're going?
[2:30:08.900 --> 2:30:10.900]  Oh
[2:30:11.100 --> 2:30:14.580]  Royce would you like to go first? Oh, I will go first. That's great
[2:30:14.580 --> 2:30:20.620]  Um, I I think that we're going down a very very dark path. I mean look don't get me wrong
[2:30:20.740 --> 2:30:24.300]  There is some hope there's some people that are are fighting back like you know
[2:30:24.300 --> 2:30:26.500]  We're lucky enough to live in Florida, right?
[2:30:26.500 --> 2:30:31.220]  Where DeSantis has actually been fighting back against back in passports and stuff like that, you know
[2:30:31.220 --> 2:30:33.540]  They shut down the cruising industry here for example
[2:30:33.540 --> 2:30:39.220]  And then you find out that a cruise that was 100% vaccinated two people still got COVID, right?
[2:30:39.620 --> 2:30:40.940]  and
[2:30:40.940 --> 2:30:44.420]  Which I think is one of the funniest things so the lie is
[2:30:45.580 --> 2:30:50.340]  I see a lot of people that you wouldn't even call political people that I know that don't even follow stuff starting
[2:30:50.340 --> 2:30:52.820]  You know, they'll tell you in private because they have a job. They'll be like
[2:30:52.820 --> 2:30:58.380]  I don't know what's happening, but I'm starting out to trust these people and when you see normies as we call them
[2:30:58.380 --> 2:31:02.300]  Just really start questioning things. There is a ray of hope
[2:31:02.300 --> 2:31:06.500]  I don't want to put out this message that we're done, right? Because it's easy to become complacent
[2:31:06.500 --> 2:31:09.260]  It's easy to just let the fire consume you, right?
[2:31:09.980 --> 2:31:11.980]  But I think that there is some hope
[2:31:12.500 --> 2:31:18.740]  In in there's certain people fighting back. I totally agree. There's hope and so other people should get involved realizing
[2:31:18.740 --> 2:31:21.860]  There's not just evil. That's why I said we have an effect my show others who
[2:31:22.540 --> 2:31:26.560]  There's not just evil in the world people who realize the power they have and use it
[2:31:28.260 --> 2:31:31.340]  Yeah, yeah, and I mean I would just add to that look
[2:31:31.340 --> 2:31:33.340]  you know
[2:31:33.340 --> 2:31:39.100]  Yeah, like Roy said, we're heading down a bad road, but um, you know, we only have so much control over it
[2:31:39.100 --> 2:31:41.100]  You should fight back, but at the same time
[2:31:41.700 --> 2:31:49.280]  It shouldn't dominate your life like go outside. Enjoy enjoy life while we have it go to a dog park start
[2:31:50.780 --> 2:31:57.100]  They want us to press it alone. Why are they so into that like what type of jerks want to make people depressed?
[2:31:57.100 --> 2:32:02.700]  Because yeah, because isolation has proven time and time again that
[2:32:03.260 --> 2:32:06.780]  I said, it's what they do to people in prison. They put you in the hole you come out
[2:32:06.780 --> 2:32:12.060]  You're not the same guy. So they want you to be isolated. They want us to feel disconnected
[2:32:12.060 --> 2:32:18.260]  They don't want you know, I I feel entirely different when I go to the you know, there's a lake where I go jog sometimes
[2:32:18.260 --> 2:32:21.420]  I feel entirely different there because everybody's doing the same thing
[2:32:21.420 --> 2:32:28.380]  Everybody's listening to music and joining the scenery getting some fresh community and there's a oneness. Yeah cleanses the soul
[2:32:28.380 --> 2:32:31.420]  And it's it's not yeah, and there's none of this Twitter
[2:32:32.020 --> 2:32:35.260]  divisive angry negative like that's why I'm saying
[2:32:36.540 --> 2:32:38.140]  Fisher system
[2:32:38.140 --> 2:32:41.820]  While at the same time being part of it because that's my my my paradox. I
[2:32:42.620 --> 2:32:48.740]  Think that less emphasis needs to be put on owning live tards on the internet
[2:32:48.740 --> 2:32:55.820]  I think people need to stop watching videos from the cut and taking the bait and writing, you know, angry reaction
[2:32:56.420 --> 2:33:03.060]  Reactionary comments and in the you know to try to give them what they want. I would say get your own house in order
[2:33:03.060 --> 2:33:08.860]  No, I agree. I agree. That's really gonna stop that over. I'm gonna rub it. No huge. We need to just say hey
[2:33:08.860 --> 2:33:14.860]  I love you and I'm sorry. Whatever's happening. I don't like where we're going. What should we do because they want that fight
[2:33:14.860 --> 2:33:22.140]  They explain that well, yeah, just don't take the bait. I mean most of these media companies are dropping these little videos or these
[2:33:22.140 --> 2:33:24.140]  little incendiary tweets and
[2:33:24.260 --> 2:33:29.100]  People think that it's like oh, they're pushing this propaganda and they are but that's only one side of the coin
[2:33:29.100 --> 2:33:34.540]  They're also tweeting that kind of stuff and they're specifically choosing a very crummy tone
[2:33:34.940 --> 2:33:36.980]  Because they want to get the reaction out of you
[2:33:36.980 --> 2:33:42.860]  They want to have screenshots of right-wingers and Pepe frogs and people with you know Alex Jones avatars
[2:33:42.860 --> 2:33:47.620]  You know yelling back instead of just just just don't engage them in that way
[2:33:47.820 --> 2:33:52.580]  Get your own affairs in order get in shape save money learn how to shoot
[2:33:53.100 --> 2:33:56.260]  You know what? I mean like and and find time to still enjoy
[2:33:56.420 --> 2:34:02.660]  You know time around the people you enjoy and and do that like make yourself a strong individual
[2:34:02.660 --> 2:34:05.620]  I agree. They are American relation from us
[2:34:05.620 --> 2:34:12.540]  Yeah, America the original 13 colonies. I mean was a bunch of strong rugged individuals
[2:34:12.780 --> 2:34:17.460]  That decided you know what I'm really getting sick of these British like let's get them the hell out of here
[2:34:17.500 --> 2:34:21.420]  But it was just and I mean we were completely overwhelmed by the British
[2:34:21.420 --> 2:34:28.100]  But it was the fact that everybody was so different and diverse and strong and at different ideas about what the future government would be
[2:34:28.100 --> 2:34:31.620]  But everybody knew how to shoot a musket everybody knew how to you know
[2:34:31.620 --> 2:34:36.940]  Everybody knew how to grow food like people knew how to do stuff and the more they pushed us the more powerful we got
[2:34:37.620 --> 2:34:41.740]  And now we just eat best food and now we just order everything on Uber eats
[2:34:41.740 --> 2:34:46.340]  and nobody knows how to grow a carrot and everybody's overweight and it's like
[2:34:46.980 --> 2:34:48.980]  They do we're right where they want us
[2:34:49.060 --> 2:34:54.860]  To add on to them so what Mike is saying and and I think this is important a lot of people take the bait
[2:34:54.860 --> 2:34:56.820]  It's easy to take it. It's right
[2:34:56.820 --> 2:35:01.380]  You know look at these honeypots where they want you to show up and be violent where they want you to show up and yell
[2:35:01.380 --> 2:35:05.180]  Look at that. Look at that that person that was speaking at Yale that psychiatrist
[2:35:05.180 --> 2:35:09.340]  It said I want to shoot white people in the head. They put that stuff out on purpose
[2:35:09.340 --> 2:35:13.980]  They put that stuff out not for you to go. Oh, look how the left is freezing. Get us to fight with each other
[2:35:14.940 --> 2:35:21.380]  And then before you know what they're writing article about you and go see this is why we have to take guns away from right-wingers
[2:35:21.380 --> 2:35:25.780]  See this is why these people can't aren't our shouldn't be allowed to vote
[2:35:25.780 --> 2:35:30.420]  There was that lady that got mad because she was in Long Island and she saw American flags
[2:35:30.420 --> 2:35:35.900]  I'm Emma in Washington Post reporter. She was like, oh, I saw American flags and it was so terrible
[2:35:35.900 --> 2:35:39.700]  Though my gut reaction and everybody's gut reaction is like what are you crazy?
[2:35:39.700 --> 2:35:42.500]  I you want to yell at them when you go wait it you start wondering
[2:35:42.940 --> 2:35:46.460]  They're doing this on purpose. They're doing this because they want you to react
[2:35:46.460 --> 2:35:51.180]  They want to make you look crazy. They want to make you look crazier than them because at the end of the day
[2:35:51.180 --> 2:35:55.460]  I want to send to a war with them instead of we should just you don't get in a war with dog crap on your shoes
[2:35:55.460 --> 2:35:57.300]  You just clean it off
[2:35:57.300 --> 2:36:03.180]  Exactly and and they're trying they're trying to turn a class war into a race war. So, you know, one of my things
[2:36:03.180 --> 2:36:10.500]  I always know the communist model like that Chinese lady in Virginia said she said I was a little girl and watch them use class
[2:36:10.500 --> 2:36:14.500]  To kill everybody now. They're using race to do it. We see to reject this. It's so obvious
[2:36:15.300 --> 2:36:17.380]  Yeah, and and it's unfortunate
[2:36:17.380 --> 2:36:23.140]  But I you know we always tell our audience despite the fact that the SPLC labeled me and Royce hardcore white supremacists
[2:36:23.140 --> 2:36:31.060]  I'd say our our message has been consistent for years, which is that we're never gonna fix this problem unless there is a coalition of people
[2:36:31.540 --> 2:36:33.020]  You know
[2:36:33.020 --> 2:36:41.900]  Surrounding buildings and it needs to be black white Hispanic gay straight like I I understand that all these little subgroups have all their
[2:36:41.980 --> 2:36:44.180]  Differences and but that's kind of what America is
[2:36:46.020 --> 2:36:48.020]  Corporate global takeover
[2:36:48.020 --> 2:36:53.980]  Exactly and it's not like the white man isn't gonna do it. The black man isn't gonna do it
[2:36:53.980 --> 2:36:59.820]  It you it really needs to be a coalition and unfortunately exactly the opposite of what they want is unity
[2:36:59.900 --> 2:37:02.180]  So they're afraid of us unify we unify
[2:37:02.860 --> 2:37:05.780]  Yeah, and that and that's why they that's why they're caught
[2:37:05.780 --> 2:37:07.780]  That's why the cut is allowed to exist
[2:37:07.780 --> 2:37:10.980]  But me and Royce aren't allowed to exist and then you're not allowed to exist
[2:37:10.980 --> 2:37:13.900]  There's a reason why the more divisive
[2:37:13.900 --> 2:37:19.340]  There's a reason when something certified by the system, you know, it's bad
[2:37:20.060 --> 2:37:24.060]  Yeah, exactly. It just makes me automatically know. I'm like, okay. Well, this is BS
[2:37:25.540 --> 2:37:29.900]  Whenever you see the sit whenever you see the entire system is a goal these right wing
[2:37:29.900 --> 2:37:36.740]  But there's a select group of neocons that are allowed to play in the playground because they're good little boys and girls and like
[2:37:36.740 --> 2:37:44.580]  Well, you know, actually all we want is lower taxes. No, I'm way past lower taxes, you know, I want to
[2:37:44.580 --> 2:37:48.620]  Stay there guys. We got calls coming up too. It's a big news. They're out back big news
[2:37:48.620 --> 2:37:55.820]  So it's so big. I said covered Star Wars show the scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years
[2:37:55.820 --> 2:38:02.140]  Has now gone from beta testing to operational the globalist are out of the open with their planetary depopulation
[2:38:02.140 --> 2:38:09.460]  Takeover their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for
[2:38:09.460 --> 2:38:13.700]  Decades to get ready for this to be able to find it off humanity is strong
[2:38:13.740 --> 2:38:16.900]  We're incredible and we're aware of the attack that's happening
[2:38:16.900 --> 2:38:21.020]  We have a real chance of defeating it if we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it
[2:38:21.020 --> 2:38:27.300]  So prayer is essential research is essential getting prepared as essential and warning others is absolutely essential

[2:38:51.940 --> 2:38:56.060]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in
[2:38:56.060 --> 2:39:04.180]  1900 with the Petrochemical the Petrochemical then dominated two major industries plastics and drugs
[2:39:04.740 --> 2:39:06.740]  Companies began synthesizing
[2:39:07.060 --> 2:39:12.900]  patented versions of naturally sourced drugs the natural sources were then made illegal
[2:39:13.500 --> 2:39:18.500]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine and the sicker people got the more their industry grew
[2:39:18.820 --> 2:39:22.300]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape
[2:39:22.300 --> 2:39:28.300]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive
[2:39:29.060 --> 2:39:32.140]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today
[2:39:32.580 --> 2:39:40.940]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy

[2:39:58.580 --> 2:40:03.300]  Thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people
[2:40:03.300 --> 2:40:08.940]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria
[2:40:09.700 --> 2:40:11.700]  Infection on my lung that'll never go away
[2:40:11.700 --> 2:40:19.540]  A living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[2:40:19.540 --> 2:40:25.140]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now
[2:40:25.140 --> 2:40:30.220]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be
[2:40:30.820 --> 2:40:36.820]  Afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[2:40:36.820 --> 2:40:42.420]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
[2:40:42.420 --> 2:40:48.300]  That's right where we're at brother and that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say
[2:40:48.300 --> 2:40:51.840]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country
[2:40:53.060 --> 2:40:59.540]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be you have to understand
[2:41:00.260 --> 2:41:02.260]  that this is all a test this
[2:41:02.700 --> 2:41:05.540]  experience this wife on this planet is a
[2:41:05.540 --> 2:41:07.420]  reckoning
[2:41:07.420 --> 2:41:08.980]  It's God
[2:41:08.980 --> 2:41:11.660]  Giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension
[2:41:12.140 --> 2:41:14.140]  So we can decide where we want to spend eternity
[2:41:14.660 --> 2:41:18.620]  What level we want to go to and it really does come down to that so as
[2:41:19.300 --> 2:41:22.780]  Saddest things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as well
[2:41:22.780 --> 2:41:29.260]  And realize that God is the author of our consciousness. God is the author of us having our own will
[2:41:29.260 --> 2:41:35.780]  God is the author of us having free will and the free will is a beautiful thing
[2:41:36.140 --> 2:41:43.020]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood in this whole evil culture in Washington, DC and Fauci and the and the mass cult
[2:41:43.260 --> 2:41:47.700]  It's all about dominating your free will. It's all about telling you you're dirty directly
[2:41:47.700 --> 2:41:52.620]  You're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God the creator of the universe
[2:41:52.620 --> 2:41:58.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:42:12.740 --> 2:42:14.740]  Waging war on corruption
[2:42:14.740 --> 2:42:23.500]  All right, next hour is coming up and James and others holding I'm gonna go to your calls
[2:42:24.580 --> 2:42:28.060]  Along with Rob do's ask me during the break you so what's the big news? What's the big news?
[2:42:29.740 --> 2:42:34.340]  Well, it's big news. That's big news and I'm gonna do a special
[2:42:35.460 --> 2:42:40.380]  Saturday show tomorrow 5 p.m. In the layer. I'm gonna tape to Eric before that for two hours on this
[2:42:40.380 --> 2:42:43.060]  But I will mention it and talk about it, but it's like
[2:42:43.060 --> 2:42:51.420]  The Crimson Contagion, it's like lockstep you see all over Fox News now. We told you about it 11 years ago and again a year ago
[2:42:52.300 --> 2:42:55.620]  This is big. This is like we don't tell you
[2:42:56.460 --> 2:42:58.140]  the BS
[2:42:58.140 --> 2:43:03.140]  By the way, you talk about people like what magic lottery numbers people pay for like fake lottery numbers never work
[2:43:03.340 --> 2:43:08.180]  This is like real lottery numbers. If you knew all this stuff, you could totally dominate
[2:43:08.820 --> 2:43:12.340]  And I don't give you inside stuff. It just makes money. That's not my goal
[2:43:12.340 --> 2:43:14.940]  It's not my you know what I do people said well
[2:43:14.940 --> 2:43:20.340]  Even you've you knew six months before Joe Rogan had done a Spotify contract and it was gonna double its prices
[2:43:20.340 --> 2:43:24.660]  Why didn't you tell us because that'd be insider trading? I don't do that, but this
[2:43:25.460 --> 2:43:32.740]  This is that knowing the future is important and the damn enemy admits it all so let me ask both these guys revenge of the Sith
[2:43:32.740 --> 2:43:34.740]  co-host here. I
[2:43:34.860 --> 2:43:38.060]  Don't know if you saw my Bill Gates suicide challenge earlier
[2:43:38.060 --> 2:43:43.580]  But the Bill Gates suicide challenge like the ice bucket challenge in Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Prince
[2:43:44.100 --> 2:43:50.140]  Philip who's dead now and and his son Prince Charles said there's too many people they want a virus to exterminate us
[2:43:50.140 --> 2:43:54.020]  I don't want anybody to die. I don't want to commit suicide. I'm not about to do it myself
[2:43:54.020 --> 2:44:01.620]  I'm just saying I will if Bill Gates blows his head off tomorrow or next week and says this is the Alex Jones suicide challenge
[2:44:01.620 --> 2:44:06.380]  There's so many people he blows this head off. I have a man of my word. I will blow my head off on air
[2:44:06.380 --> 2:44:09.140]  Joining Bill Gates. What do you guys make of that? I
[2:44:10.140 --> 2:44:12.140]  mean
[2:44:13.660 --> 2:44:17.780]  That's one of the best that's one of the best challenges I've ever heard in my life
[2:44:17.780 --> 2:44:21.180]  And secondly, I would I would pay good money
[2:44:21.500 --> 2:44:26.860]  Good money to do to for them to do to do the to do the daffy duck like I could only do this once
[2:44:27.180 --> 2:44:31.100]  It's just it just ended all because then I'd be like, all right
[2:44:31.100 --> 2:44:34.980]  You put your money where you put your money where your mouth is right and you did it
[2:44:34.980 --> 2:44:37.260]  But then you know, you know what? I would do though Alex
[2:44:37.260 --> 2:44:41.540]  Well, if that were to happen and let's say they do it you come on your show and you go just kidding
[2:44:41.540 --> 2:44:45.980]  I'm lying to you like you lied to me and you keep going on. Okay. You just get the plan away
[2:44:47.580 --> 2:44:51.860]  No, I was gonna everybody just only to die you go first asshole
[2:44:52.620 --> 2:44:57.380]  Yes, yeah, I was more worried because I was gonna say don't fall for the tricks Alex you're too honest
[2:44:57.380 --> 2:45:03.540]  See what would happen is Bill Gates would either do a deep fake or he would have a look alike like a clone do it
[2:45:03.540 --> 2:45:05.700]  And then he would just trick you so don't fall for it
[2:45:06.780 --> 2:45:09.860]  It'd be like exploding head scanners exactly he would stage it
[2:45:09.860 --> 2:45:15.380]  But he wouldn't be because Bill Gates is dead already. So you can't you can't kill a dead a dead
[2:45:16.100 --> 2:45:18.100]  Whatever he is
[2:45:18.500 --> 2:45:21.340]  I like that little self little self-editing there
[2:45:26.260 --> 2:45:31.900]  When we're off the air later, I want you to tell me the three words that came to mind before you settled on whatever he is
[2:45:31.900 --> 2:45:33.900]  Well, let's just say there's no
[2:45:36.140 --> 2:45:42.900]  No, I mean seriously he goes around saying kill everybody and now he's the guy that wants me to take his injections. I mean how well that's been
[2:45:43.780 --> 2:45:47.420]  Yeah, that's been one of my biggest issues from day one and I've been saying this like
[2:45:48.060 --> 2:45:53.780]  It's the same people that want population reduction that have now suddenly come around and been like here take the shot here
[2:45:53.780 --> 2:45:56.860]  Take it take it real quick and I'm like no and they're like we're gonna save you
[2:45:56.860 --> 2:46:02.660]  And I'm like you literally just wrote like a million studies over the past five years about how we need to reduce the population
[2:46:02.980 --> 2:46:09.420]  And now your next thing is you want to save lives. I feel like this is a weird pivot. So yeah, I don't I don't trust it
[2:46:09.420 --> 2:46:17.020]  I don't trust their their their plans and I'm not taking the shot plus. I've already had COVID. So is Royce. We're fine
[2:46:17.740 --> 2:46:24.060]  It's all of the mainline science says don't take a vaccine for something. You've already had they've known that for a hundred years
[2:46:24.060 --> 2:46:30.980]  And they go no you're gonna take it anyways. It's like all be damned. You're gonna do it. I mean wow that is crazy
[2:46:31.740 --> 2:46:37.140]  Yeah, it's the same the same people that have been telling us they hate us for four years are now the ones that are like
[2:46:37.140 --> 2:46:41.100]  Please take the shot. It's for the good of all of us and I'm like, but you hate me
[2:46:41.100 --> 2:46:47.700]  You've been sent you're still saying on Twitter that you hate me and in the same breath telling me that I should get the vaccine and
[2:46:48.380 --> 2:46:53.220]  Let's talk about how many how many new billionaires there are now in these pharma companies because of it, you know
[2:46:53.220 --> 2:47:01.020]  The what is it like five new billionaires in these pharma companies because of of the vaccines that are going out there if you make something
[2:47:01.580 --> 2:47:06.460]  Mandatory and then you sell it to the public and they're a lot of them saying oh, we're giving it away
[2:47:06.500 --> 2:47:09.420]  Yeah, sure you are but you're also getting the name recognition
[2:47:09.420 --> 2:47:10.340]  You're getting like oh man
[2:47:10.340 --> 2:47:16.580]  You saw Pfizer save the world and a lot of these people that are injecting these things of them where people that ten years ago
[2:47:16.580 --> 2:47:21.700]  We're like man big pharma is terrible. Can you believe big pharma? Look what they're doing. They're putting these pills down your throats
[2:47:21.700 --> 2:47:27.140]  This is the same industry that has people overdosing in the middle of the country and it's fine
[2:47:27.140 --> 2:47:30.260]  And they're telling you know, but this time we're not lying to you. I'm sorry
[2:47:30.260 --> 2:47:36.780]  But I see too many daytime talk shows where you said the commercials are the lawyers going like did you have did you take a
[2:47:36.780 --> 2:47:43.940]  Pill in 2012 and now your brain blew up. I'm not gonna. I'm not falling for it. I'm just I will have lung cancer from yeah
[2:47:43.940 --> 2:47:47.380]  It's constant. Exactly. You can see this. Let me ask you both this
[2:47:47.380 --> 2:47:52.940]  Why do they do something so reckless so out of control when the studies show what they're actually doing?
[2:47:52.940 --> 2:47:58.980]  They've tested this stuff before they didn't do official tests as they knew the same type of vaccines killed rats killed pigs
[2:47:59.180 --> 2:48:05.140]  Caused blood clots and now we saw blood clots all over Europe that did it first now. It's here like all blood clots. We heard of that
[2:48:05.140 --> 2:48:08.460]  I mean, why would they do something so obviously villainous?
[2:48:09.580 --> 2:48:15.940]  There is nothing about the way they have handled this during any phase that tells me that they're
[2:48:15.940 --> 2:48:17.940]  That their intentions are altruistic
[2:48:20.340 --> 2:48:22.180]  Historically, we've had other pandemics
[2:48:22.180 --> 2:48:28.980]  We've had other rushes to get the right medicine and and and do the right medical to and and it's never been done like this before
[2:48:28.980 --> 2:48:34.700]  They have never just said, okay, we're gonna give the entire plan at this thing now get it now that never used to be the way
[2:48:34.700 --> 2:48:40.780]  They did it nothing about the way this has been structured tells me that there's anything altruistic behind it
[2:48:40.780 --> 2:48:44.540]  So I it's all an exercise to see what we'll put up with it's a test
[2:48:44.540 --> 2:48:46.540]  Mm-hmm
[2:48:46.740 --> 2:48:48.740]  Testing our yeah
[2:48:48.820 --> 2:48:52.660]  Why they did it is very simple because there's no consequences
[2:48:52.660 --> 2:48:57.780]  I mean imagine imagine if you if you wanted to have go they didn't get in trouble for spying on Trump
[2:48:57.780 --> 2:49:03.180]  Then did you get in trouble for funding al-qaeda? They didn't get in for all the autistic kids exactly. That's the key
[2:49:03.180 --> 2:49:08.460]  There's no consequences. So how do consequences come into play for claus swab and Bill Gates?
[2:49:09.660 --> 2:49:13.700]  Well, I mean they there's gonna be no consequences and then there never is right
[2:49:13.700 --> 2:49:19.540]  I mean that that's the thing when you have the when you have the Senate say that you can't you can't sue these companies, right?
[2:49:19.540 --> 2:49:23.460]  Like for five years, you're not allowed to sue them if your vaccine gives you a blood clot
[2:49:23.460 --> 2:49:28.220]  You're not allowed to do anything. That's immunity right there. So no wonder. I mean think about it
[2:49:28.220 --> 2:49:34.140]  It's these pharma companies would would die to have this level of experimentation
[2:49:34.820 --> 2:49:39.620]  These are companies that want eugenics the population on record who have immunity to do it
[2:49:39.620 --> 2:49:43.780]  Yeah, and they're gonna get away with it. I mean it's not just get away with it
[2:49:43.780 --> 2:49:48.820]  They're gonna do it and a lot of people believe. Oh, it's a one. Oh, they're gonna be heroes saving us from COVID
[2:49:49.460 --> 2:49:50.740]  They're gonna do it again
[2:49:50.740 --> 2:49:55.580]  And this is if we let this what I said at the beginning they've given me a lot of crap because everyone's all scared
[2:49:55.580 --> 2:49:58.460]  But we're saying if you let them get away with this
[2:49:58.860 --> 2:50:04.420]  You don't even want to know what's coming next because what's coming next is gonna be worse. Oh, yeah
[2:50:04.420 --> 2:50:06.420]  Well, let me ask you both in closing
[2:50:06.420 --> 2:50:09.380]  How do we fight out of this? I mean, what do you think we do?
[2:50:09.540 --> 2:50:15.460]  Because I think the average person in this system being replaced by robots by AI even at Google that censors us
[2:50:15.580 --> 2:50:20.340]  Don't they get they're being targeted as well. I agree what you were saying earlier Royce is
[2:50:20.980 --> 2:50:24.740]  Fighting with these people's fun. We do it. It's normal, but I don't want to fight
[2:50:24.740 --> 2:50:27.620]  I want them to go. Hey, you're getting screwed too and listen to us
[2:50:30.380 --> 2:50:35.180]  Well, yeah, I mean I just don't go good. Sorry about it. It's like that old saying, you know
[2:50:35.180 --> 2:50:41.300]  Uh, when when you when you appease when you appease the mob, they may eat you last but they're gonna eat you
[2:50:41.300 --> 2:50:44.860]  But right now they're good little lap dogs. They're getting pats on the head and they're getting free money
[2:50:44.900 --> 2:50:47.540]  So why wouldn't you right now in the short term? It looks great
[2:50:48.740 --> 2:50:51.940]  That's right closing comments here Marsh
[2:50:52.900 --> 2:50:57.020]  No, just you know, like you said, yeah, this is the sort of the end game here
[2:50:57.060 --> 2:51:02.740]  You know, there's a clip of you going around on Twitter somebody posted two days ago of you describing everything
[2:51:02.740 --> 2:51:07.460]  It's happening with COVID what 16 years ago except you were discussing RFID chips
[2:51:07.540 --> 2:51:14.940]  But all the same all the same the incentives the fads the shaming the making it fashionable all this stuff
[2:51:14.940 --> 2:51:18.900]  You were literally 16 years ago talking about this with shipping people. So
[2:51:19.620 --> 2:51:24.940]  Look, I you know, I'm starting to sort of transition a little bit spiritually into a place where I
[2:51:25.780 --> 2:51:29.340]  Don't I don't think we win here on earth and then it's it's unfortunate
[2:51:29.340 --> 2:51:32.620]  So, I mean, I really just think you should try to enjoy your life as best you can
[2:51:33.180 --> 2:51:38.780]  Safe, you know, just educate yourself be smart. Look out for your family. Enjoy the good
[2:51:40.060 --> 2:51:42.060]  And our consciousness it matters exactly
[2:51:42.500 --> 2:51:46.100]  Yeah, I said you only have them dominion over this here
[2:51:46.100 --> 2:51:51.580]  Oh, just make sure this here is in tip-top form and and and fight back
[2:51:51.580 --> 2:51:56.940]  But don't be obnoxious don't take the bait and be just be somebody that when people see them
[2:51:56.940 --> 2:52:00.780]  Or when people see you they go that guy really seems to have his shit
[2:52:01.380 --> 2:52:07.980]  Don't fight they want fight back the real be somebody people want to be and then when they come to you and go
[2:52:07.980 --> 2:52:13.220]  Why are you like this? You can go I go to church and I do this and you know, this is where I find my strength and you know
[2:52:13.220 --> 2:52:16.300]  Maybe you know to win hearts and minds that way
[2:52:16.300 --> 2:52:19.980]  But just stop taking the the cultural toxic Twitter bait

[2:52:27.140 --> 2:52:33.580]  I'll also mention the big news that I'm not just like holding that back. It's some carrot. This is so horrible
[2:52:33.580 --> 2:52:38.980]  It gives me a headache. So I don't want to cover this. It's like getting a fight like I don't want to fight

[2:56:06.340 --> 2:56:10.580]  it but that's okay because human activity can share what your guys are up to
[2:56:10.580 --> 2:56:13.900]  so I want to get two minute comments from both of you in closing let's finish
[2:56:13.900 --> 2:56:20.540]  up here first off with Royce and then get Merch's take yeah you know we were
[2:56:20.540 --> 2:56:24.220]  demonetized from YouTube oh man almost two years ago the reasons they gave us
[2:56:24.220 --> 2:56:28.660]  was flimsy they said you could be on here but you can't make money you can't
[2:56:28.660 --> 2:56:31.060]  make money doing it which you know what we're fine with we have other ways of
[2:56:31.060 --> 2:56:36.100]  doing it you know when we first started on YouTube they banned us for 90 days out
[2:56:36.100 --> 2:56:40.500]  of our first year 90 days we were just doing stuff we were just like guerrilla
[2:56:40.500 --> 2:56:44.380]  warfare you know we were doing shows oh we had remember Royce remember Royce we
[2:56:44.380 --> 2:56:48.580]  had to we six months out of the first year that's correct you're right six
[2:56:48.580 --> 2:56:52.940]  months and it's all about nerds with a corporation that runs death camps
[2:56:52.940 --> 2:56:56.820]  censoring you because they have power like I was never mean to nerds so why
[2:56:56.820 --> 2:57:01.260]  did nerds beat me up all day I was always nice to nerds not only did they beat
[2:57:01.260 --> 2:57:04.900]  you up Alex but then Susan gives herself a freedom of speech award so that's
[2:57:04.900 --> 2:57:08.900]  pretty good and then they think they're people making fun of her giving imagine
[2:57:08.900 --> 2:57:14.020]  myself the info wars award for being good Alex Jones I was like a clown what
[2:57:14.020 --> 2:57:17.740]  is the tone-deafness of giving yourself a free speech award when you're giving
[2:57:17.740 --> 2:57:22.940]  yourself the award and you destroy free speech I mean it's a double double deal
[2:57:22.940 --> 2:57:26.800]  it's like going around giving all these kids wedgies and then giving yourself an
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:35.220]  empathy award yeah and then you always make it ridiculous like I mean cuz
[2:57:35.220 --> 2:57:38.700]  that's like on purpose if you wanted to be cynical and make yourself look bad
[2:57:38.700 --> 2:57:41.940]  that oh I'm gonna give myself a free speech award when I ban everything and
[2:57:41.940 --> 2:57:45.340]  I'll give myself the award like who's that tone-deaf to give themselves an
[2:57:45.340 --> 2:57:50.020]  award well I mean these guys love doing these like humiliation rituals I mean
[2:57:50.020 --> 2:57:53.140]  look at all the weird things Bill de Blasio has been doing he's like dressing
[2:57:53.140 --> 2:57:57.660]  up in Nets jerseys and like eating shake shack and like doing this wacky like
[2:57:57.660 --> 2:58:01.460]  he's like like they just have him going out humiliating himself on a regular
[2:58:01.460 --> 2:58:08.460]  and I like he's never eaten a burger he's I mean like yeah honestly I think
[2:58:08.460 --> 2:58:13.060]  the oligarchs that control us also control Bill de Blasio and I think that
[2:58:13.060 --> 2:58:17.980]  just as much as they enjoy crushing us they also enjoy humiliating the people
[2:58:17.980 --> 2:58:21.820]  that think they're in charge and that's why you see Bill de Blasio dressed up
[2:58:21.820 --> 2:58:26.220]  like a like that's why they hated Trump cuz he thought he was in charge yeah
[2:58:26.220 --> 2:58:30.900]  and because he kind of was for a while and they showed him real quick too you
[2:58:30.900 --> 2:58:34.500]  know they they showed him real quick towards the end there when he was going
[2:58:34.500 --> 2:58:37.460]  you know was like hey are you gonna are you gonna part in Snowden are you gonna
[2:58:37.460 --> 2:58:40.740]  party as the part in the songs and I guarantee you there was a phone call that
[2:58:40.740 --> 2:58:44.260]  was like look we're gonna lay off for you and your family but you better make
[2:58:44.260 --> 2:58:49.460]  sure those guys stay where they're at oh yeah right as much as I like Trump
[2:58:49.460 --> 2:58:54.300]  because he's not them still like you know what he did to Assange it means he
[2:58:54.300 --> 2:58:57.860]  would sit there while I was in solitary confinement he said a song release
[2:58:57.860 --> 2:59:04.380]  release the emails he did it and then he like has him in prison to be fair Alex
[2:59:04.380 --> 2:59:09.140]  it was it came down to him or Lil Wayne and you know Julian Assange didn't come
[2:59:09.140 --> 2:59:15.780]  out with the Carter so little way if Julia Sange rap better maybe he'd be a
[2:59:15.780 --> 2:59:19.980]  free man right now yeah Julian Assange could spit hot fire maybe he'd be you
[2:59:19.980 --> 2:59:25.620]  know out in the streets unbelievable all right revenge of the sins can I just
[2:59:25.620 --> 2:59:29.380]  say before we go Alex thank you thank you thank you so much for having us on
[2:59:29.380 --> 2:59:34.380]  I've been listening to you for over 20 years now since I had to click the win
[2:59:34.380 --> 2:59:48.660]  amp plug-in on a website to open up a separate thing to hear the live 365
[2:59:49.940 --> 2:59:55.540]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there about
[2:59:55.540 --> 2:59:58.420]  looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist that the
[2:59:58.420 --> 3:00:01.780]  public so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from
[3:00:01.780 --> 3:00:05.340]  them that we're poisoning them that we're sterilizing them then they deserve
[3:00:05.340 --> 3:00:10.060]  to be killed yes that's the position of the globalist they play God and they
[3:00:10.060 --> 3:00:14.780]  think because we don't stand up they have a right to do this to us you know
[3:00:14.780 --> 3:00:18.100]  I've told you that the globalist who tried to hire me they try to get you to
[3:00:18.100 --> 3:00:23.140]  join them but metaphysically at a spiritual level I have the Holy Spirit
[3:00:23.140 --> 3:00:27.340]  I'm connection gods and I know that God does not like that so I cannot join the
[3:00:27.340 --> 3:00:32.540]  animal but I'll tell you at a selfish level I get very very mad at people to
[3:00:32.540 --> 3:00:35.580]  go along with the system believing you're part of it or believing you're
[3:00:35.580 --> 3:00:39.900]  getting power on them whether you're just a steelworker or a school teacher or
[3:00:39.900 --> 3:00:45.860]  Henry Kissinger you're not God and treating other people like their animals
[3:00:45.860 --> 3:00:49.900]  and your God is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like that's
[3:00:49.900 --> 3:01:04.500]  a fact
[3:01:19.900 --> 3:01:24.900]  I did not see all the becoming of me
[3:01:26.900 --> 3:01:29.900]  Ride the tiger, you can see his stripes
[3:01:29.900 --> 3:01:31.900]  But you know he's clean
[3:01:31.900 --> 3:01:34.900]  Oh, don't you see what I mean
[3:01:34.900 --> 3:01:36.900]  Gotta run away
[3:01:36.900 --> 3:01:38.900]  Gotta get away
[3:01:40.900 --> 3:01:42.900]  Turn it up, this is the key part right here
[3:01:42.900 --> 3:01:47.900]  Ah, yeah, between the velvet lines
[3:01:51.900 --> 3:01:53.900]  Between the velvet lines
[3:01:54.900 --> 3:01:56.900]  There's a truth as hard as steel
[3:01:56.900 --> 3:02:04.900]  There's a key part right here
[3:02:05.900 --> 3:02:08.900]  Oh, we will praise the rise
[3:02:09.900 --> 3:02:11.900]  Gotta get away
[3:02:12.900 --> 3:02:14.900]  Get away
[3:02:16.900 --> 3:02:19.900]  Between the velvet lines
[3:02:19.900 --> 3:02:25.900]  There's a truth as hard as steel
[3:02:26.900 --> 3:02:30.900]  The vision never dies
[3:02:31.900 --> 3:02:35.900]  Like some never-ending wheel
[3:02:35.900 --> 3:02:38.900]  Jump, jump to the tiger
[3:02:38.900 --> 3:02:41.900]  You're the star of the masquerade
[3:02:41.900 --> 3:02:44.900]  No need to look so afraid
[3:02:44.900 --> 3:02:48.900]  Jump, jump, jump on the tiger
[3:02:48.900 --> 3:02:50.900]  Keep your feelings hot
[3:02:50.900 --> 3:02:52.900]  But you know he's mean
[3:02:52.900 --> 3:02:55.900]  Some light can never be seen
[3:02:55.900 --> 3:02:57.900]  Some light can never be seen
[3:02:58.900 --> 3:03:00.900]  Alright, good stuff today.
[3:03:00.900 --> 3:03:01.900]  Good policy.
[3:03:01.900 --> 3:03:03.900]  Alright, let's race through your calls.
[3:03:05.900 --> 3:03:07.900]  And I was going to air a part of Harrison Smith's
[3:03:07.900 --> 3:03:09.900]  in a great interview with Judge Joe Brown.
[3:03:09.900 --> 3:03:11.900]  He got some attention on his show, but needs to really get bigger.
[3:03:11.900 --> 3:03:13.900]  He said some stuff on that show he didn't sell mine.
[3:03:13.900 --> 3:03:15.900]  It was really powerful.
[3:03:15.900 --> 3:03:20.900]  But, man, I said this is big news.
[3:03:20.900 --> 3:03:24.900]  I've not been holding off on this to make you keep tuning in.
[3:03:24.900 --> 3:03:26.900]  I just don't know if I can do this justice.
[3:03:26.900 --> 3:03:29.900]  I will at least mention this before we end the broadcast today.
[3:03:31.900 --> 3:03:38.900]  And then I will be live tomorrow.
[3:03:39.900 --> 3:03:41.900]  Alright, let's go ahead and take your calls.
[3:03:41.900 --> 3:03:43.900]  Who's been on the longest?
[3:03:43.900 --> 3:03:45.900]  Is it Alex? No, is it James?
[3:03:45.900 --> 3:03:47.900]  Well, James has been on the wall.
[3:03:47.900 --> 3:03:50.900]  Is it Jim? It's James in Pennsylvania.
[3:03:50.900 --> 3:03:52.900]  James, you're a tripper. We love you. Thank you.
[3:03:53.900 --> 3:03:55.900]  I was sure. Thank you very much.
[3:03:55.900 --> 3:03:57.900]  Wear my fog shirt. It's great.
[3:03:57.900 --> 3:03:59.900]  Thank you, sir. That is the new best seller.
[3:03:59.900 --> 3:04:00.900]  We love it.
[3:04:00.900 --> 3:04:01.900]  Love it.
[3:04:01.900 --> 3:04:04.900]  So I will not be participating in Bill Gates's
[3:04:04.900 --> 3:04:06.900]  Fauci Market to Be System.
[3:04:06.900 --> 3:04:09.900]  I'm going to hold out as long as possible.
[3:04:09.900 --> 3:04:12.900]  I'm not taking that vaccine that I knew was bad.
[3:04:12.900 --> 3:04:16.900]  My wife occasionally has to be around another woman.
[3:04:16.900 --> 3:04:20.900]  But how surreal is it to see him not let people in public parks
[3:04:20.900 --> 3:04:25.900]  in New York, unless you've had Bill Gates's dingling in you?
[3:04:25.900 --> 3:04:28.900]  No, that's his violation of Nuremberg code,
[3:04:28.900 --> 3:04:30.900]  violation of my civil rights, that's a free human being.
[3:04:30.900 --> 3:04:32.900]  I'm not going to participate.
[3:04:32.900 --> 3:04:34.900]  I agree, but don't just hold out.
[3:04:34.900 --> 3:04:36.900]  Warn others like you're doing now.
[3:04:36.900 --> 3:04:41.900]  You can't warn these people because they've bought into their
[3:04:41.900 --> 3:04:44.900]  mass media propaganda system Obama.
[3:04:44.900 --> 3:04:45.900]  It's their right.
[3:04:45.900 --> 3:04:48.900]  We're being raped by big corporations, by big government.
[3:04:48.900 --> 3:04:50.900]  Just like, let me put this in you.
[3:04:50.900 --> 3:04:51.900]  It's experimental.
[3:04:51.900 --> 3:04:52.900]  Yeah, it's killing people.
[3:04:52.900 --> 3:04:53.900]  Let me do it. Let me do it.
[3:04:53.900 --> 3:04:55.900]  Screw my job. Screw my future.
[3:04:55.900 --> 3:04:58.900]  By the way, you want war? You got one.
[3:05:00.900 --> 3:05:03.900]  Spiritual warfare brought to the physical realm.
[3:05:03.900 --> 3:05:05.900]  You're witnessing it.
[3:05:05.900 --> 3:05:07.900]  The people around you, they're empty shells.
[3:05:07.900 --> 3:05:09.900]  They've bought into the...
[3:05:09.900 --> 3:05:13.900]  Spiritual warfare brought to the human realm, exactly.
[3:05:13.900 --> 3:05:16.900]  I mean, I'm hired to kite fighting this.
[3:05:16.900 --> 3:05:18.900]  I'm so damn high on the Holy Spirit.
[3:05:18.900 --> 3:05:21.900]  Like, oh, you're such a hero fighting evil.
[3:05:21.900 --> 3:05:24.900]  I'm a hero jacking into like the most awesome stuff ever.
[3:05:24.900 --> 3:05:26.900]  You can put a gun to my head.
[3:05:26.900 --> 3:05:27.900]  I wouldn't back down.
[3:05:27.900 --> 3:05:29.900]  You see what I'm saying, brother?
[3:05:29.900 --> 3:05:31.900]  Jesus is everything.
[3:05:31.900 --> 3:05:33.900]  You're not going to find God in these churches now.
[3:05:33.900 --> 3:05:35.900]  They're telling you to take the microchip.
[3:05:35.900 --> 3:05:37.900]  You're going to find God at 3 a.m.
[3:05:37.900 --> 3:05:39.900]  to touch you. You understand what I'm saying?
[3:05:39.900 --> 3:05:43.900]  Christ is king. The 501c3 church has failed Christianity.
[3:05:43.900 --> 3:05:45.900]  Unfortunately, Alex...
[3:05:45.900 --> 3:05:47.900]  Beautiful said. I'm going to jump to the next guy.
[3:05:47.900 --> 3:05:49.900]  Scott in Pennsylvania, then Max.
[3:05:49.900 --> 3:05:52.900]  Scott, you're on the air worldwide.
[3:05:53.900 --> 3:05:56.900]  Thank you, Alex, for bringing me on air.
[3:05:56.900 --> 3:05:59.900]  It's such an honor to talk to you
[3:05:59.900 --> 3:06:04.900]  and to be in this fight with you over this long period of time.
[3:06:04.900 --> 3:06:09.900]  Welcome, Megatron. I am Unicron. Go ahead.
[3:06:09.900 --> 3:06:11.900]  Yes, sir.
[3:06:13.900 --> 3:06:18.900]  I really honestly think at this point Project Bluebeam is live,
[3:06:18.900 --> 3:06:22.900]  and I actually had one question.
[3:06:22.900 --> 3:06:27.900]  Do you think C-60 or anything of that nature
[3:06:27.900 --> 3:06:31.900]  could put a line of defense against...
[3:06:31.900 --> 3:06:36.900]  Nothing will defeat evil but a giant awakening to Christ
[3:06:36.900 --> 3:06:38.900]  and repentance, and I don't say that I'm a high horse.
[3:06:38.900 --> 3:06:40.900]  I'm a wicked devil, but I know God's in charge.
[3:06:40.900 --> 3:06:42.900]  My allegiance is with Christ,
[3:06:42.900 --> 3:06:45.900]  and only Christ can heal me of my forked tail.
[3:06:45.900 --> 3:06:48.900]  And I'm just like, I'm pointed at God right now,
[3:06:48.900 --> 3:06:50.900]  and I am just...
[3:06:50.900 --> 3:06:53.900]  The only thing is standing up for God.
[3:06:53.900 --> 3:06:55.900]  Yes, sir.
[3:06:55.900 --> 3:07:00.900]  All my life, I have always stood in God's presence,
[3:07:00.900 --> 3:07:07.900]  but I didn't always realize that being in such a position
[3:07:07.900 --> 3:07:12.900]  just absolutely blows the socks off me, honestly.
[3:07:12.900 --> 3:07:14.900]  Well, that's it, and you can't direct it.
[3:07:14.900 --> 3:07:16.900]  You've got to have the Holy Spirit to direct it.
[3:07:16.900 --> 3:07:18.900]  I'm giving myself that speech all the time.
[3:07:18.900 --> 3:07:20.900]  I want to try to direct this. You can't do it.
[3:07:20.900 --> 3:07:22.900]  Today, I felt totally sick. I didn't want to go on air.
[3:07:22.900 --> 3:07:25.900]  I'm so upset. I'm not even getting ready for the show.
[3:07:25.900 --> 3:07:28.900]  I said, God, just take me over, and today has been an incredible broadcast
[3:07:28.900 --> 3:07:30.900]  and I literally turned it loose.
[3:07:30.900 --> 3:07:31.900]  And that's what it's all about.
[3:07:31.900 --> 3:07:34.900]  God doesn't possess us like Satan does.
[3:07:34.900 --> 3:07:39.900]  God has free will, and we have to turn ourselves over,
[3:07:39.900 --> 3:07:42.900]  and then God's going to see how far we can take it.
[3:07:42.900 --> 3:07:44.900]  So that's what it comes down to.
[3:07:44.900 --> 3:07:45.900]  All right, God bless you, brother.
[3:07:45.900 --> 3:07:48.900]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:07:48.900 --> 3:07:53.900]  Whoo! Let's talk to Jack in Washington.
[3:07:53.900 --> 3:07:55.900]  Then we'll talk to Max and others.
[3:07:55.900 --> 3:07:57.900]  Go ahead, Jack.
[3:07:57.900 --> 3:08:00.900]  Alex, my man, thank you for letting me on your show.
[3:08:00.900 --> 3:08:01.900]  Appreciate it.
[3:08:01.900 --> 3:08:04.900]  I appreciate everything you do and the world does.
[3:08:04.900 --> 3:08:07.900]  I have created my own show as well to keep sharing out the information.
[3:08:07.900 --> 3:08:10.900]  Tell us about it. Tell us about it. Tell us about it.
[3:08:10.900 --> 3:08:16.900]  So what I created is it's not created just for me.
[3:08:16.900 --> 3:08:19.900]  I just started it, and I want the world to take over it.
[3:08:19.900 --> 3:08:21.900]  But something just started. You called in the plug-in.
[3:08:21.900 --> 3:08:24.900]  That makes it great. Tell me about it. Tell me what you're doing.
[3:08:24.900 --> 3:08:28.900]  What I'm doing is called the Axiom World Alliance.
[3:08:28.900 --> 3:08:30.900]  And it's the website.
[3:08:30.900 --> 3:08:32.900]  And I'm starting to get things on there,
[3:08:32.900 --> 3:08:34.900]  and this is a lot harder than people realize.
[3:08:34.900 --> 3:08:37.900]  And I appreciate every single thing you do, man.
[3:08:37.900 --> 3:08:38.900]  I really do.
[3:08:38.900 --> 3:08:43.900]  And what it is, is in the days we used to have a community,
[3:08:43.900 --> 3:08:47.900]  a church sense, where we would help one another.
[3:08:47.900 --> 3:08:50.900]  We'd go out and we would fight for one another.
[3:08:50.900 --> 3:08:51.900]  What's our voices?
[3:08:51.900 --> 3:08:54.900]  If someone fell, we'd pick them up. We don't do that anymore.
[3:08:54.900 --> 3:09:01.900]  So my goal with my shitty ass rumble shows that I do live,
[3:09:01.900 --> 3:09:04.900]  because I believe in live, I believe in real emotion.
[3:09:04.900 --> 3:09:06.900]  Live is good.
[3:09:06.900 --> 3:09:08.900]  I want everybody to come together.
[3:09:08.900 --> 3:09:10.900]  And yeah, I get passionate.
[3:09:10.900 --> 3:09:12.900]  And there's reasons for that.
[3:09:12.900 --> 3:09:14.900]  And I know I don't have much time.
[3:09:14.900 --> 3:09:16.900]  But my main goal is bringing everybody together.
[3:09:16.900 --> 3:09:20.900]  So we have a community and network instead of everybody's egos.
[3:09:20.900 --> 3:09:23.900]  I'm not saying you or the gentleman that go on the show,
[3:09:23.900 --> 3:09:25.900]  but there's a lot of egos out there.
[3:09:25.900 --> 3:09:26.900]  And we need to break it down.
[3:09:26.900 --> 3:09:28.900]  We need to create a community,
[3:09:28.900 --> 3:09:31.900]  because we are the underground community of free speech.
[3:09:31.900 --> 3:09:35.900]  And so the more we share, the more we educate people.
[3:09:35.900 --> 3:09:36.900]  I agree with you.
[3:09:36.900 --> 3:09:38.900]  Let me say something.
[3:09:38.900 --> 3:09:40.900]  Because I could do a 10-hour show on this,
[3:09:40.900 --> 3:09:44.900]  but I'm going to do 60 seconds on it right now.
[3:09:44.900 --> 3:09:49.900]  You hear about ego and id and psychology
[3:09:49.900 --> 3:09:51.900]  and all the schools of psychology.
[3:09:51.900 --> 3:09:56.900]  Those are just men creating labels for what humanity is.
[3:09:56.900 --> 3:10:01.900]  We have an ego as a mission we're supposed to carry out.
[3:10:01.900 --> 3:10:03.900]  And your ego is supposed to be the mission you carry out,
[3:10:03.900 --> 3:10:06.900]  not something about you.
[3:10:06.900 --> 3:10:08.900]  And then your family and who you are and what you stand for
[3:10:08.900 --> 3:10:10.900]  and your spiritual connection to everything else.
[3:10:10.900 --> 3:10:11.900]  So forget all these terms.
[3:10:11.900 --> 3:10:14.900]  If you have a mission for justice,
[3:10:14.900 --> 3:10:16.900]  you turn your ego over to that.
[3:10:16.900 --> 3:10:20.900]  You don't want to get rid of your ego like John Lennon wanted to do.
[3:10:20.900 --> 3:10:21.900]  No, no, no, no.
[3:10:21.900 --> 3:10:23.900]  Because then there's somebody else's in control.
[3:10:23.900 --> 3:10:28.900]  The ego is there as the tip of the spear for what your intention is.
[3:10:28.900 --> 3:10:31.900]  And so your ego needs to be empowering people big strong
[3:10:31.900 --> 3:10:35.900]  and believing in yourself so much
[3:10:35.900 --> 3:10:38.900]  you're ready to take on 100 people if need be.
[3:10:38.900 --> 3:10:39.900]  And the left hates that.
[3:10:39.900 --> 3:10:40.900]  Oh, don't be a narcissist.
[3:10:40.900 --> 3:10:42.900]  Don't have an ego because they're afraid of power
[3:10:42.900 --> 3:10:45.900]  that God gave these cells.
[3:10:45.900 --> 3:10:48.900]  Ah!
[3:10:48.900 --> 3:10:51.900]  It's not a secret why in the leftist controlled cities
[3:10:51.900 --> 3:10:53.900]  all over the world, not just the U.S.,
[3:10:53.900 --> 3:10:55.900]  they encourage people to live in tents
[3:10:55.900 --> 3:10:56.900]  and he's just homeless,
[3:10:56.900 --> 3:10:59.900]  and he used drugs and alcohol and engaged in petty crime.
[3:10:59.900 --> 3:11:03.900]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030,
[3:11:03.900 --> 3:11:04.900]  of course the Great Reset,
[3:11:04.900 --> 3:11:07.900]  they want to lower expectations.
[3:11:07.900 --> 3:11:09.900]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere.
[3:11:09.900 --> 3:11:12.900]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[3:11:12.900 --> 3:11:15.900]  They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse.
[3:11:15.900 --> 3:11:17.900]  The globalists fly around in private jets.
[3:11:17.900 --> 3:11:19.900]  They have huge private mistakes.
[3:11:19.900 --> 3:11:21.900]  They are separate from us.
[3:11:21.900 --> 3:11:23.900]  Their children go to private tutors.
[3:11:23.900 --> 3:11:24.900]  They admit this.
[3:11:24.900 --> 3:11:26.900]  And now they want us to lock down,
[3:11:26.900 --> 3:11:28.900]  telecommunicating with each other,
[3:11:28.900 --> 3:11:31.900]  so that we are not actually out physically building
[3:11:31.900 --> 3:11:33.900]  a pro-human infrastructure.
[3:11:33.900 --> 3:11:35.900]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G
[3:11:35.900 --> 3:11:38.900]  has been a controlled robot in autonomous cars and trucks.
[3:11:38.900 --> 3:11:40.900]  This is all their admitted plan.
[3:11:40.900 --> 3:11:43.900]  The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta.
[3:11:43.900 --> 3:11:44.900]  It's gone operational.
[3:11:44.900 --> 3:11:46.900]  It's a post-human future.
[3:11:46.900 --> 3:11:48.900]  You better find out about it right now.
[3:11:48.900 --> 3:11:50.900]  Again, I don't like to lecture people.
[3:11:50.900 --> 3:11:51.900]  I'm a very private person,
[3:11:51.900 --> 3:11:54.900]  but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity,
[3:11:54.900 --> 3:11:57.900]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure,
[3:11:57.900 --> 3:12:00.900]  and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money
[3:12:00.900 --> 3:12:01.900]  because of God.
[3:12:01.900 --> 3:12:04.900]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day,
[3:12:04.900 --> 3:12:05.900]  but just give me a break.
[3:12:05.900 --> 3:12:06.900]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[3:12:06.900 --> 3:12:07.900]  I've always been a Christian,
[3:12:07.900 --> 3:12:11.900]  but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[3:12:11.900 --> 3:12:12.900]  And I get it.
[3:12:12.900 --> 3:12:14.900]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[3:12:14.900 --> 3:12:18.900]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system,
[3:12:18.900 --> 3:12:19.900]  and I get it, me too.
[3:12:19.900 --> 3:12:20.900]  Believe me, I'm one of them.
[3:12:20.900 --> 3:12:24.900]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe
[3:12:24.900 --> 3:12:27.900]  that God created that is so essential.
[3:12:27.900 --> 3:12:31.900]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through
[3:12:31.900 --> 3:12:32.900]  and to have life.
[3:12:32.900 --> 3:12:34.900]  And so that's what M4 Wars is really all about.
[3:12:34.900 --> 3:12:36.900]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[3:12:36.900 --> 3:12:38.900]  Thank you for spreading the word about M4 Wars.
[3:12:38.900 --> 3:12:42.900]  And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting M4WarsTour.com.
[3:12:42.900 --> 3:12:44.900]  Because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases,
[3:12:44.900 --> 3:12:45.900]  we'll be taking off the air.
[3:12:45.900 --> 3:13:07.900]  So thank you for the support M4WarsTour.com.
[3:13:16.900 --> 3:13:22.900]  Well, I'm going to host the rest of the broadcast today.
[3:13:22.900 --> 3:13:26.900]  And I just saw some incredible footage at M4Wars.com
[3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:31.900]  that is the most cringe-worthy garbage the world's ever seen.
[3:13:31.900 --> 3:13:36.900]  We want control of our social actions, our sexual actions, our interfaces.
[3:13:36.900 --> 3:13:39.900]  Because our interfaces.
[3:13:39.900 --> 3:13:41.900]  Between man and woman.
[3:13:41.900 --> 3:13:45.900]  The double helix of the DNA is holding.
[3:13:45.900 --> 3:13:48.900]  And they seek to take control of that.
[3:13:48.900 --> 3:13:50.900]  But they will not.
[3:13:50.900 --> 3:13:53.900]  They will burn in hell.
[3:13:53.900 --> 3:13:58.900]  The crimes that they are committing against humanity
[3:13:58.900 --> 3:14:05.900]  and against God's creation will echo throughout eternity.
[3:14:05.900 --> 3:14:11.900]  Know this, when you look at the pathetic Fauci and the disgusting Macron
[3:14:11.900 --> 3:14:16.900]  and the degenerate Merkel and the pathetic Biden,
[3:14:16.900 --> 3:14:20.900]  they are the failures, not us.
[3:14:20.900 --> 3:14:22.900]  All right, let's race through your calls.
[3:14:22.900 --> 3:14:24.900]  I'll let this big story as I promised to do.
[3:14:24.900 --> 3:14:26.900]  Who's up next holding here?
[3:14:26.900 --> 3:14:29.900]  That would be Max in Kansas.
[3:14:29.900 --> 3:14:31.900]  Max, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:14:31.900 --> 3:14:33.900]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex. God bless you, brother.
[3:14:33.900 --> 3:14:35.900]  God bless you.
[3:14:35.900 --> 3:14:37.900]  So, I know how to stop it.
[3:14:37.900 --> 3:14:39.900]  Okay, because the new world is making their moves.
[3:14:39.900 --> 3:14:41.900]  They're going full throttle.
[3:14:41.900 --> 3:14:44.900]  My high school is pushing this vaccine for them to shake, too.
[3:14:44.900 --> 3:14:46.900]  But people need to know about it.
[3:14:46.900 --> 3:14:49.900]  And understanding their plan is critical to defeat it.
[3:14:49.900 --> 3:14:51.900]  We defeated it by, well, there's two ways.
[3:14:51.900 --> 3:14:54.900]  First way of defeating them with truth and information,
[3:14:54.900 --> 3:14:57.900]  what I mean by is getting to have conversations with people,
[3:14:57.900 --> 3:15:01.900]  inform them, give them the facts and make sure it doesn't...
[3:15:01.900 --> 3:15:04.900]  Making them know it's fun to resist tyranny.
[3:15:04.900 --> 3:15:06.900]  I mean, can you believe in New York,
[3:15:06.900 --> 3:15:09.900]  they're cutting off public parks and saying,
[3:15:09.900 --> 3:15:11.900]  you can't go with them unless you've been injected?
[3:15:11.900 --> 3:15:15.900]  That's criminal. They should all go to jail.
[3:15:15.900 --> 3:15:17.900]  Yes, they should.
[3:15:17.900 --> 3:15:20.900]  And I've convinced people not to get the vaccine before.
[3:15:20.900 --> 3:15:22.900]  And I consider that a pretty big win.
[3:15:22.900 --> 3:15:24.900]  You haven't done that.
[3:15:24.900 --> 3:15:26.900]  Any game with people.
[3:15:26.900 --> 3:15:28.900]  Tell me how you did that. Tell folks about that.
[3:15:28.900 --> 3:15:33.900]  So, I had a friend who was 18 and he got offered an option
[3:15:33.900 --> 3:15:37.900]  to get like an experiment, like an experiment
[3:15:37.900 --> 3:15:40.900]  on how they test vaccines on people before they release them.
[3:15:40.900 --> 3:15:43.900]  He got offered to do that and he asked me if I should.
[3:15:43.900 --> 3:15:46.900]  And I told him, no, he was like, why?
[3:15:46.900 --> 3:15:49.900]  And then I showed him the articles from InfoWars
[3:15:49.900 --> 3:15:52.900]  and gave away plenty of people having, I mean, the worst,
[3:15:52.900 --> 3:15:55.900]  the worst reactions, people were dying.
[3:15:55.900 --> 3:15:57.900]  And it was really powerful. And I convinced him not to.
[3:15:57.900 --> 3:15:59.900]  I convinced my mom not to get it when her old family was...
[3:15:59.900 --> 3:16:01.900]  Well, I say you're saving the world.
[3:16:01.900 --> 3:16:03.900]  Because of the millions of listeners of this show,
[3:16:03.900 --> 3:16:06.900]  except we do what you did, we would save these people.
[3:16:06.900 --> 3:16:09.900]  None of this is to protect it. It's all admitted.
[3:16:09.900 --> 3:16:12.900]  Yeah. I shared any game with people.
[3:16:12.900 --> 3:16:14.900]  I changed people's minds on topics.
[3:16:14.900 --> 3:16:15.900]  So, yeah, that's...
[3:16:15.900 --> 3:16:17.900]  By the way, this little joke, just like blacks couldn't use
[3:16:17.900 --> 3:16:19.900]  the water fountains, they're saying,
[3:16:19.900 --> 3:16:21.900]  you can't come to this restaurant
[3:16:21.900 --> 3:16:23.900]  or you can't go to this water fountain unless you have a shot.
[3:16:23.900 --> 3:16:27.900]  I mean, they're recreating what they always want
[3:16:27.900 --> 3:16:29.900]  and something Christians have been fighting,
[3:16:29.900 --> 3:16:33.900]  that we're dividing. We need to come together.
[3:16:33.900 --> 3:16:35.900]  And the second way is to be on the attack.
[3:16:35.900 --> 3:16:37.900]  And I don't mean physically, but what I mean is to oppose
[3:16:37.900 --> 3:16:41.900]  everything they do, push back, protest,
[3:16:41.900 --> 3:16:44.900]  urge your local sheriffs or politicians to fight the evil,
[3:16:44.900 --> 3:16:46.900]  get the ball rolling, create media pages,
[3:16:46.900 --> 3:16:48.900]  piss off Zuckerberg and Dorsey,
[3:16:48.900 --> 3:16:50.900]  and repost the articles from InfoWars
[3:16:50.900 --> 3:16:52.900]  or Gateway Pond International File,
[3:16:52.900 --> 3:16:54.900]  even if it gets you bad.
[3:16:54.900 --> 3:16:56.900]  I totally agree and we love your brother.
[3:16:56.900 --> 3:16:58.900]  Call us again. Thanks for holding.
[3:16:58.900 --> 3:17:00.900]  Let's go to New Jersey and Jim.
[3:17:00.900 --> 3:17:03.900]  Jim in New Jersey, go ahead.
[3:17:03.900 --> 3:17:05.900]  Yeah, Alex.
[3:17:05.900 --> 3:17:08.900]  I'm thinking with taking these vaccines,
[3:17:08.900 --> 3:17:11.900]  I'm thinking the only way we're going to get out from under this
[3:17:11.900 --> 3:17:14.900]  is that this whole operation of theirs
[3:17:14.900 --> 3:17:17.900]  just goes off the rails really quick,
[3:17:17.900 --> 3:17:19.900]  a lot quicker than they expected it to be,
[3:17:19.900 --> 3:17:22.900]  rather than a prolonged death kill
[3:17:22.900 --> 3:17:25.900]  that it happens more immediate because,
[3:17:25.900 --> 3:17:28.900]  you know, until the world starts seeing all the carnage,
[3:17:28.900 --> 3:17:32.900]  you know, they're going to move forward with their plan,
[3:17:32.900 --> 3:17:34.900]  you know, so to speak.
[3:17:34.900 --> 3:17:37.900]  And they're able to, they're all testing how to have deaths,
[3:17:37.900 --> 3:17:39.900]  how to make it no big deal, how to cover,
[3:17:39.900 --> 3:17:42.900]  it's all a test to see can we kill people, exactly.
[3:17:42.900 --> 3:17:45.900]  Exactly. And the other thing too is that,
[3:17:45.900 --> 3:17:48.900]  you know, with Trump, I really want Trump
[3:17:48.900 --> 3:17:51.900]  to have another America-first challenger,
[3:17:51.900 --> 3:17:54.900]  because if he doesn't have anybody else challenging him,
[3:17:54.900 --> 3:17:56.900]  he's never going to be challenged.
[3:17:56.900 --> 3:17:59.900]  I agree. If General Flynn challenges him with a good message,
[3:17:59.900 --> 3:18:01.900]  Trump will adopt it.
[3:18:01.900 --> 3:18:04.900]  And I'm not against Trump, but Trump is, he's not dumb,
[3:18:04.900 --> 3:18:06.900]  he's kind of like an idiot, so far.
[3:18:06.900 --> 3:18:08.900]  He means well, but that's what they said,
[3:18:08.900 --> 3:18:11.900]  like whoever he talked to last is what he says.
[3:18:11.900 --> 3:18:13.900]  And so, yeah, that's the truth.
[3:18:13.900 --> 3:18:16.900]  Because if we just put him in office,
[3:18:16.900 --> 3:18:19.900]  we could become victims again to another four years
[3:18:19.900 --> 3:18:21.900]  of Trump not doing anything.
[3:18:21.900 --> 3:18:23.900]  I mean, he never had control of his DOJ.
[3:18:23.900 --> 3:18:26.900]  Biden's in, he doesn't even know what shoe to put on,
[3:18:26.900 --> 3:18:28.900]  but he has control of his DOJ.
[3:18:28.900 --> 3:18:32.900]  You know, it's things that Trump needs to do.
[3:18:32.900 --> 3:18:35.900]  I mean, I think he's a great person, and I believe in him,
[3:18:35.900 --> 3:18:39.900]  but if we don't get him to own up to some of the mistakes
[3:18:39.900 --> 3:18:42.900]  and tell us what he's going to do differently in these four years,
[3:18:42.900 --> 3:18:44.900]  we're going to get all that work.
[3:18:44.900 --> 3:18:46.900]  I totally agree because you make mistakes,
[3:18:46.900 --> 3:18:48.900]  I make mistakes, we own up to them.
[3:18:48.900 --> 3:18:50.900]  We've not seen any of that from Trump,
[3:18:50.900 --> 3:18:52.900]  and I'm not ganging up on Trump,
[3:18:52.900 --> 3:18:55.900]  it's just he needs to know who took him to the dance.
[3:18:55.900 --> 3:19:00.900]  Exactly, because you know, if he doesn't get a hold,
[3:19:00.900 --> 3:19:03.900]  he's got to do what Biden's doing to us conservatives.
[3:19:03.900 --> 3:19:08.900]  He's got to come in and he's got to legally put those people
[3:19:08.900 --> 3:19:11.900]  behind bars that he didn't put behind bars.
[3:19:11.900 --> 3:19:13.900]  And by the way, they're all Chinese agents.
[3:19:13.900 --> 3:19:15.900]  They have no reason to arrest us.
[3:19:15.900 --> 3:19:19.900]  The Democrats are like half of them are pedophiles.
[3:19:19.900 --> 3:19:23.900]  I mean, the whole group is a group of criminal, crazy people.
[3:19:23.900 --> 3:19:25.900]  Yeah, he's got to understand,
[3:19:25.900 --> 3:19:28.900]  it's no more Mr. Nice guy being doing it legally,
[3:19:28.900 --> 3:19:31.900]  but get brown.
[3:19:31.900 --> 3:19:33.900]  Tim, I hear you, we're under communist attack.
[3:19:33.900 --> 3:19:36.900]  Absolutely. All right, let's take another call here.
[3:19:36.900 --> 3:19:41.900]  Let's talk to Marty in the great state of Kentucky.
[3:19:41.900 --> 3:19:42.900]  Go ahead, Marty.
[3:19:42.900 --> 3:19:45.900]  Hey, man, it's Barney. How you doing tonight?
[3:19:45.900 --> 3:19:47.900]  I'm sorry, they said Marty Barney, but go ahead, Barney.
[3:19:47.900 --> 3:19:48.900]  That's all right, buddy.
[3:19:48.900 --> 3:19:52.900]  I love you. You love me. You've never heard that joke.
[3:19:52.900 --> 3:19:58.900]  Roger, no. Yeah, I'm down here in rural Kentucky,
[3:19:58.900 --> 3:20:00.900]  and it's just crazy.
[3:20:00.900 --> 3:20:03.900]  You think people down here would be pushing back,
[3:20:03.900 --> 3:20:07.900]  but they're just falling in line like every time I go out,
[3:20:07.900 --> 3:20:10.900]  everybody had their mask on until I think they just
[3:20:10.900 --> 3:20:13.900]  put the mandate either yesterday or today.
[3:20:13.900 --> 3:20:16.900]  But I mean, I don't know.
[3:20:16.900 --> 3:20:19.900]  I think you need to come out with like a five minute red pill
[3:20:19.900 --> 3:20:23.900]  video, like that I can send to people and, you know,
[3:20:23.900 --> 3:20:26.900]  like have it all condensed down.
[3:20:26.900 --> 3:20:29.900]  Well, I agree that we need to red pill everybody and have,
[3:20:29.900 --> 3:20:31.900]  you know, because this is pathetic.
[3:20:31.900 --> 3:20:33.900]  I feel like, oh, I'm a hero. I'm helping. I want to help.
[3:20:33.900 --> 3:20:34.900]  No, you're not helping.
[3:20:34.900 --> 3:20:37.900]  You're agreeing to a medical tourney world government takeover.
[3:20:37.900 --> 3:20:40.900]  Well, I got a guy at work with, he's a leftist,
[3:20:40.900 --> 3:20:44.900]  and I call him Little Mal, and he takes it as a compliment.
[3:20:44.900 --> 3:20:47.900]  You know, but he goes out and says like,
[3:20:47.900 --> 3:20:50.900]  he hates big corporations and Bill Gates,
[3:20:50.900 --> 3:20:53.900]  and then he comes in the next day, you know,
[3:20:53.900 --> 3:20:56.900]  showing off his vaccines that he got.
[3:20:56.900 --> 3:20:57.900]  He said, oh, no.
[3:20:57.900 --> 3:21:00.900]  Does he not realize that China is like as big corporation
[3:21:00.900 --> 3:21:02.900]  as you get?
[3:21:02.900 --> 3:21:05.900]  Right. I mean, it didn't dawn on me so recently that,
[3:21:05.900 --> 3:21:08.900]  you know, I was thinking China was our enemy,
[3:21:08.900 --> 3:21:09.900]  but they're not.
[3:21:09.900 --> 3:21:11.900]  Like you always say, they are the model.
[3:21:11.900 --> 3:21:16.900]  Like that's where the absolute power goes
[3:21:16.900 --> 3:21:18.900]  and does everything they want to do.
[3:21:18.900 --> 3:21:21.900]  Exactly. China already got the room.
[3:21:21.900 --> 3:21:24.900]  The Chinese people are our enemy. They got eaten.
[3:21:24.900 --> 3:21:25.900]  Right.
[3:21:25.900 --> 3:21:28.900]  And so we want to try to free what's left of them.
[3:21:28.900 --> 3:21:29.900]  Damn right.
[3:21:29.900 --> 3:21:31.900]  All right. Thank you so much for the call.
[3:21:31.900 --> 3:21:32.900]  All right.
[3:21:32.900 --> 3:21:35.900]  We have more calls straight ahead here in the fourth hour,
[3:21:35.900 --> 3:21:38.900]  and we are 30 minutes and two minutes out,
[3:21:38.900 --> 3:21:43.900]  32 minutes out from the war room with Owen Shroyer.
[3:21:43.900 --> 3:21:44.900]  Stay with us.
[3:21:47.900 --> 3:21:50.900]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about
[3:21:50.900 --> 3:21:54.900]  for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[3:21:54.900 --> 3:21:57.900]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary
[3:21:57.900 --> 3:22:00.900]  depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[3:22:00.900 --> 3:22:03.900]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working,
[3:22:03.900 --> 3:22:05.900]  and others have been working across the planet for decades
[3:22:05.900 --> 3:22:08.900]  to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:22:08.900 --> 3:22:10.900]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible.
[3:22:10.900 --> 3:22:12.900]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[3:22:12.900 --> 3:22:14.900]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:22:14.900 --> 3:22:16.900]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:22:16.900 --> 3:22:19.900]  So prayer is essential. Research is essential.
[3:22:19.900 --> 3:22:20.900]  Getting prepared is essential,
[3:22:20.900 --> 3:22:23.900]  and warning others is absolutely essential.
[3:22:23.900 --> 3:22:25.900]  And at the same time, supporting info wars
[3:22:25.900 --> 3:22:28.900]  by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential
[3:22:28.900 --> 3:22:30.900]  because they're great products for you and your family,
[3:22:30.900 --> 3:22:32.900]  and they're also funding our operation.
[3:22:32.900 --> 3:22:34.900]  Infowarsstore.com.
[3:22:34.900 --> 3:22:37.900]  Infowarsstore.com is incredible.
[3:22:37.900 --> 3:22:39.900]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because
[3:22:39.900 --> 3:22:41.900]  the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies,
[3:22:41.900 --> 3:22:43.900]  vasobites, and others.
[3:22:43.900 --> 3:22:45.900]  So get them today at infowarsstore.com,
[3:22:45.900 --> 3:22:48.900]  and I thank you for being part of The Resistance.
[3:22:48.900 --> 3:22:52.900]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry
[3:22:52.900 --> 3:22:55.900]  in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[3:22:55.900 --> 3:22:59.900]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries,
[3:22:59.900 --> 3:23:01.900]  plastics and drugs.
[3:23:01.900 --> 3:23:04.900]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions
[3:23:04.900 --> 3:23:06.900]  of naturally sourced drugs.
[3:23:06.900 --> 3:23:09.900]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[3:23:09.900 --> 3:23:12.900]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine,
[3:23:12.900 --> 3:23:15.900]  and the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[3:23:15.900 --> 3:23:19.900]  It's a death cult, and it's up to the individual to escape.
[3:23:19.900 --> 3:23:22.900]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system,
[3:23:22.900 --> 3:23:25.900]  which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[3:23:25.900 --> 3:23:29.900]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[3:23:29.900 --> 3:23:31.900]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc
[3:23:31.900 --> 3:23:33.900]  and vitamin D3 with calcium
[3:23:33.900 --> 3:23:35.900]  have been proven to be what we need
[3:23:35.900 --> 3:23:38.900]  to maintain a healthy immune system.
[3:23:38.900 --> 3:23:40.900]  Go to infowarsstore.com
[3:23:40.900 --> 3:23:43.900]  and start supporting your natural immune system now
[3:23:43.900 --> 3:23:45.900]  with the Mega Immune Support Pack.
[3:23:45.900 --> 3:23:48.900]  Now 40% off.
[3:23:48.900 --> 3:23:51.900]  One of the most common questions I get on air,
[3:23:51.900 --> 3:23:54.900]  but also off air when I'm just out and about, is,
[3:23:54.900 --> 3:23:57.900]  Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines?
[3:23:57.900 --> 3:23:59.900]  How do I warn them?
[3:23:59.900 --> 3:24:02.900]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it.
[3:24:02.900 --> 3:24:05.900]  So many facts. It's the history of contaminated vaccines,
[3:24:05.900 --> 3:24:08.900]  the fact that they have liability protection in the U.S. and Europe,
[3:24:08.900 --> 3:24:10.900]  the fact that they've been caught adding
[3:24:10.900 --> 3:24:13.900]  sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines,
[3:24:13.900 --> 3:24:16.900]  and the whole history of secret experimentation
[3:24:16.900 --> 3:24:19.900]  on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans.
[3:24:19.900 --> 3:24:21.900]  The list goes on and on.
[3:24:21.900 --> 3:24:24.900]  But what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress
[3:24:24.900 --> 3:24:28.900]  and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021
[3:24:28.900 --> 3:24:32.900]  that around half of the NIH CDC staff,
[3:24:32.900 --> 3:24:34.900]  medical doctors, neurologist, scientists
[3:24:34.900 --> 3:24:37.900]  have refused to take the vaccine until they get safe?
[3:24:37.900 --> 3:24:40.900]  Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it,
[3:24:40.900 --> 3:24:42.900]  that's the same thing in the private practices out there,
[3:24:42.900 --> 3:24:44.900]  some more numbers, that that's not something I'm going to be taking.
[3:24:44.900 --> 3:24:48.900]  That's very, very simple. There's your answer.
[3:24:48.900 --> 3:24:51.900]  My enemies are your enemies.
[3:24:51.900 --> 3:24:53.900]  They're the globalists, they're the extremists.
[3:24:53.900 --> 3:24:55.900]  They are a consortium of bad scientists,
[3:24:55.900 --> 3:24:58.900]  pedophiles, control freaks, devil-worspers,
[3:24:58.900 --> 3:25:01.900]  vampires, wherever you want to call them,
[3:25:01.900 --> 3:25:04.900]  that are highly predatory and are setting up
[3:25:04.900 --> 3:25:08.900]  a false famously land system of constant bombardment
[3:25:08.900 --> 3:25:12.900]  of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic radiation
[3:25:12.900 --> 3:25:17.900]  to change the very DNA of the human species
[3:25:17.900 --> 3:25:20.900]  to mutate us into a form that they can control
[3:25:20.900 --> 3:25:22.900]  like a pawn on a chessboard.
[3:25:22.900 --> 3:25:24.900]  The bottom line is they want to play God,
[3:25:24.900 --> 3:25:27.900]  they are playing God, and the news is only going to
[3:25:27.900 --> 3:25:29.900]  tighten around our necks from year on out.
[3:25:29.900 --> 3:25:31.900]  So many other people want to be positive,
[3:25:31.900 --> 3:25:33.900]  they want to put out fake news,
[3:25:33.900 --> 3:25:35.900]  and want to only cover limited amounts
[3:25:35.900 --> 3:25:37.900]  of what's happening with New World Order,
[3:25:37.900 --> 3:25:39.900]  but at the end of the day it's all about the population,
[3:25:39.900 --> 3:25:41.900]  it's all about world government,
[3:25:41.900 --> 3:25:43.900]  it's all about the end of the human system as we know it,
[3:25:43.900 --> 3:25:45.900]  and on its ashes a nightmare being built,
[3:25:45.900 --> 3:25:47.900]  only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[3:26:15.900 --> 3:26:28.900]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:26:28.900 --> 3:26:31.900]  Owen Troyer is set to take over,
[3:26:31.900 --> 3:26:33.900]  in fact he's going to host the last segment of this hour
[3:26:33.900 --> 3:26:35.900]  before he does his own show.
[3:26:35.900 --> 3:26:40.900]  But the article is at infowars.com, cringe.
[3:26:40.900 --> 3:26:44.900]  G7 world leaders greet each other by bumping elbows,
[3:26:44.900 --> 3:26:46.900]  and again it's all this anti-human,
[3:26:46.900 --> 3:26:49.900]  like oh shaking hands is bad, cover your face,
[3:26:49.900 --> 3:26:52.900]  they never want to end this,
[3:26:52.900 --> 3:26:54.900]  all their minions keep doing it,
[3:26:54.900 --> 3:26:56.900]  it's all based on fraudulent PCR tests,
[3:26:56.900 --> 3:26:58.900]  I mean this is pathetic,
[3:26:58.900 --> 3:27:00.900]  they want to intimidate us,
[3:27:00.900 --> 3:27:02.900]  make us take shots to go to the park,
[3:27:02.900 --> 3:27:04.900]  what's else we're bad,
[3:27:04.900 --> 3:27:06.900]  don't bully people wearing masks and doing this,
[3:27:06.900 --> 3:27:08.900]  just laugh at them and explain to them
[3:27:08.900 --> 3:27:10.900]  what idiots they are, stop submitting,
[3:27:10.900 --> 3:27:12.900]  by the way,
[3:27:12.900 --> 3:27:14.900]  if I go to a restaurant in Austin
[3:27:14.900 --> 3:27:16.900]  or I'm downtown and I see this crap,
[3:27:16.900 --> 3:27:18.900]  I say something about it, man,
[3:27:18.900 --> 3:27:20.900]  it's all peer pressure,
[3:27:20.900 --> 3:27:22.900]  and it's up to us to be leaders, not followers,
[3:27:22.900 --> 3:27:24.900]  they explain what a joke this is,
[3:27:24.900 --> 3:27:26.900]  so here's the actual video with the hilarious audio,
[3:27:26.900 --> 3:27:28.900]  here it is.
[3:27:28.900 --> 3:27:30.900]  Remember Fauci said,
[3:27:30.900 --> 3:27:32.900]  never shake hands again,
[3:27:32.900 --> 3:27:34.900]  never have children again,
[3:27:34.900 --> 3:27:36.900]  just die and give us the earth,
[3:27:36.900 --> 3:27:46.900]  we stole it.
[3:27:46.900 --> 3:27:52.900]  You dirty, I hate you,
[3:27:52.900 --> 3:27:54.900]  die human,
[3:27:54.900 --> 3:27:56.900]  turn down to the aliens,
[3:27:56.900 --> 3:27:58.900]  die humans are dirty,
[3:27:58.900 --> 3:28:00.900]  humans are bad,
[3:28:00.900 --> 3:28:02.900]  G7 cornwall,
[3:28:02.900 --> 3:28:04.900]  eh eh eh,
[3:28:04.900 --> 3:28:06.900]  meanwhile,
[3:28:08.900 --> 3:28:10.900]  the globalists are shipping,
[3:28:10.900 --> 3:28:12.900]  fencing all in to kill us, everything,
[3:28:12.900 --> 3:28:14.900]  they ask New Yorkers, why do you wear a mask,
[3:28:14.900 --> 3:28:16.900]  and they go, because I like them,
[3:28:18.900 --> 3:28:20.900]  their nose is sticking out over it,
[3:28:20.900 --> 3:28:22.900]  they know it's a fraud, it's a sign of
[3:28:22.900 --> 3:28:24.900]  I'm in the end club,
[3:28:24.900 --> 3:28:26.900]  no, you're in the schmuck club,
[3:28:30.900 --> 3:28:32.900]  the amount of bombshell videos
[3:28:32.900 --> 3:28:34.900]  on infowars.com is just mind boggling,
[3:28:34.900 --> 3:28:36.900]  so remember, whenever you're watching this
[3:28:36.900 --> 3:28:38.900]  transmission, you think, oh wow, this is interesting,
[3:28:38.900 --> 3:28:40.900]  imagine what you're not seeing,
[3:28:40.900 --> 3:28:42.900]  imagine what's happening now,
[3:28:42.900 --> 3:28:44.900]  at the vaunted, the bad, the attack,
[3:28:44.900 --> 3:28:46.900]  the scarred,
[3:28:46.900 --> 3:28:48.900]  the punished info wars,
[3:28:48.900 --> 3:28:50.900]  still because of you,
[3:28:50.900 --> 3:28:52.900]  and your will, alive now.
[3:28:54.900 --> 3:28:56.900]  And then remember, oh, I get vitamins
[3:28:56.900 --> 3:28:58.900]  and minerals and t-shirts and books
[3:28:58.900 --> 3:29:00.900]  and water filters and films, and things that
[3:29:00.900 --> 3:29:02.900]  power me and intellectually awaken me,
[3:29:02.900 --> 3:29:04.900]  and things that spread the word
[3:29:04.900 --> 3:29:06.900]  at infowarsstore.com,
[3:29:06.900 --> 3:29:08.900]  so what are you doing,
[3:29:08.900 --> 3:29:10.900]  are you not at infowarsstore.com?
[3:29:12.900 --> 3:29:14.900]  Because it's those of the millions that
[3:29:14.900 --> 3:29:16.900]  tune in every hour, that handful,
[3:29:16.900 --> 3:29:18.900]  those thousands every day,
[3:29:18.900 --> 3:29:20.900]  and every week, that go
[3:29:20.900 --> 3:29:22.900]  and buy books, and buy films, and buy
[3:29:22.900 --> 3:29:24.900]  t-shirts, and buy supplements,
[3:29:24.900 --> 3:29:26.900]  you made the party happen,

[3:29:28.900 --> 3:29:30.900]  for your support, that's not just
[3:29:30.900 --> 3:29:32.900]  some backhanded support, that is me
[3:29:32.900 --> 3:29:34.900]  on my knees,
[3:29:34.900 --> 3:29:36.900]  thanking you for keeping me in the fight,
[3:29:36.900 --> 3:29:38.900]  because I won't bow to Satan,
[3:29:38.900 --> 3:29:40.900]  and I won't bow to the new old order,
[3:29:40.900 --> 3:29:42.900]  but I will bow to you
[3:29:42.900 --> 3:29:44.900]  for keeping us in the fight,
[3:29:44.900 --> 3:29:46.900]  and supporting us, and thank you

[3:29:52.900 --> 3:29:54.900]  the enemy, the globalist, want their cash
[3:29:54.900 --> 3:29:56.900]  to the society, they want their total control,
[3:29:56.900 --> 3:29:58.900]  they want us off air,

[3:30:40.900 --> 3:30:42.900]  no reviews on those yet,
[3:30:42.900 --> 3:30:44.900]  because
[3:30:44.900 --> 3:30:46.900]  well, one little devil did a fake review,
[3:30:46.900 --> 3:30:48.900]  but if you look at all of our older products,
[3:30:48.900 --> 3:30:50.900]  the products that have been there a long time,
[3:30:50.900 --> 3:30:52.900]  they have incredible 5-star reviews
[3:30:52.900 --> 3:30:54.900]  for the thousands and the thousands
[3:30:54.900 --> 3:30:56.900]  and the thousands, so that's how you fund
[3:30:56.900 --> 3:30:58.900]  the operation, so little click, little
[3:30:58.900 --> 3:31:00.900]  purchase product you get, they want
[3:31:00.900 --> 3:31:02.900]  to end the free market system, they want to set up a monopoly,
[3:31:02.900 --> 3:31:04.900]  so they can totally collapse
[3:31:04.900 --> 3:31:06.900]  this and make us totally poor and then dictate
[3:31:06.900 --> 3:31:08.900]  through a computer that
[3:31:08.900 --> 3:31:10.900]  watches as it controls us, that's what
[3:31:10.900 --> 3:31:12.900]  they're habituating, everybody would zoom
[3:31:12.900 --> 3:31:14.900]  and all this so that we do everything they say,
[3:31:14.900 --> 3:31:16.900]  so this is literally the
[3:31:16.900 --> 3:31:18.900]  total dystopia they're setting up,
[3:31:18.900 --> 3:31:20.900]  infowarsstore.com, please
[3:31:20.900 --> 3:31:22.900]  support us and yourselves today,
[3:31:22.900 --> 3:31:24.900]  okay
[3:31:32.900 --> 3:31:34.900]  I meant to cover this for two days
[3:31:36.900 --> 3:31:38.900]  and then as each day went by
[3:31:38.900 --> 3:31:40.900]  more of this
[3:31:40.900 --> 3:31:42.900]  information piled up
[3:31:42.900 --> 3:31:44.900]  and so, I guess
[3:31:44.900 --> 3:31:46.900]  three days have piled up and I haven't covered it
[3:31:46.900 --> 3:31:48.900]  and there's no way for me to do justice to this,
[3:31:48.900 --> 3:31:50.900]  so I'm going to cover it tomorrow
[3:31:50.900 --> 3:31:52.900]  when I come into the office at like noon
[3:31:52.900 --> 3:31:54.900]  I'm going to tape
[3:31:54.900 --> 3:31:56.900]  a two hour
[3:31:56.900 --> 3:31:58.900]  transmission
[3:31:58.900 --> 3:32:00.900]  and then I'm going to put it out on this
[3:32:00.900 --> 3:32:02.900]  subject, but since I said I would cover it
[3:32:02.900 --> 3:32:04.900]  let me just give you the news
[3:32:04.900 --> 3:32:06.900]  three stacks right here
[3:32:06.900 --> 3:32:08.900]  all this is incredible
[3:32:10.900 --> 3:32:12.900]  black rock under fire amid reports
[3:32:12.900 --> 3:32:14.900]  private equity firms are
[3:32:14.900 --> 3:32:16.900]  snapping up every family
[3:32:16.900 --> 3:32:18.900]  house
[3:32:18.900 --> 3:32:20.900]  in Texas
[3:32:20.900 --> 3:32:22.900]  now why is that so big
[3:32:28.900 --> 3:32:30.900]  because there was a rule with the Bernie Madoff
[3:32:30.900 --> 3:32:32.900]  types that just because
[3:32:32.900 --> 3:32:34.900]  you created 9% of your wealth made up
[3:32:34.900 --> 3:32:36.900]  you can't go buy
[3:32:36.900 --> 3:32:38.900]  everything up, so the big banks
[3:32:38.900 --> 3:32:40.900]  have
[3:32:40.900 --> 3:32:42.900]  quadrillions
[3:32:42.900 --> 3:32:44.900]  of fake currency they made
[3:32:44.900 --> 3:32:46.900]  they can't go out
[3:32:46.900 --> 3:32:48.900]  and buy everything up
[3:32:48.900 --> 3:32:50.900]  because people would go where'd you get all that money
[3:32:50.900 --> 3:32:52.900]  but they're doing it
[3:32:52.900 --> 3:32:54.900]  and their answer is
[3:32:54.900 --> 3:32:56.900]  lockdowns and you're poor
[3:32:56.900 --> 3:32:58.900]  and you know the big banks are tripling
[3:32:58.900 --> 3:33:00.900]  their profits you don't know what's going on
[3:33:00.900 --> 3:33:02.900]  you wonder why everything's increasing in price so much
[3:33:02.900 --> 3:33:04.900]  it's because they've created inflation
[3:33:04.900 --> 3:33:06.900]  hyperinflation
[3:33:06.900 --> 3:33:08.900]  and then now they use
[3:33:08.900 --> 3:33:10.900]  all of that liquid
[3:33:10.900 --> 3:33:12.900]  fake money they created
[3:33:12.900 --> 3:33:14.900]  to buy you up
[3:33:16.900 --> 3:33:18.900]  weaponized economics
[3:33:18.900 --> 3:33:20.900]  and they can buy your mayor
[3:33:20.900 --> 3:33:22.900]  they can buy your police chief
[3:33:22.900 --> 3:33:24.900]  they can, you know with Soros and almost all the district
[3:33:24.900 --> 3:33:26.900]  attorneys they own them
[3:33:26.900 --> 3:33:28.900]  and so that's what this is
[3:33:28.900 --> 3:33:30.900]  they implode California
[3:33:30.900 --> 3:33:32.900]  they race all their people over here to Texas
[3:33:32.900 --> 3:33:34.900]  and they start screwing them
[3:33:34.900 --> 3:33:36.900]  and so this is
[3:33:36.900 --> 3:33:38.900]  quite a time to be alive
[3:33:38.900 --> 3:33:40.900]  we'll be cover this tomorrow

[3:33:56.900 --> 3:33:58.900]  criticize sex changes for your children

[3:34:02.900 --> 3:34:04.900]  that's the Chinese social credit score
[3:34:04.900 --> 3:34:06.900]  it's all right there
[3:34:06.900 --> 3:34:08.900]  I'll cover this tomorrow

[3:34:40.900 --> 3:34:42.900]  a run

[3:34:48.900 --> 3:34:50.900]  I know
[3:34:50.900 --> 3:34:52.900]  when we're in the valley of the

[3:35:10.900 --> 3:35:12.900]  and how fast it's moving
[3:35:12.900 --> 3:35:14.900]  and how insane it's all gotten
[3:35:14.900 --> 3:35:16.900]  so please

[3:35:28.900 --> 3:35:30.900]  I tried to keep us from getting this point
[3:35:30.900 --> 3:35:32.900]  but it's all in God's hands now
[3:35:32.900 --> 3:35:34.900]  one more segment left

[3:36:54.900 --> 3:36:56.900]  the new world orders breathe them down our neck
[3:36:56.900 --> 3:36:58.900]  the big globalist publications
[3:36:58.900 --> 3:37:00.900]  are coming after us
[3:37:00.900 --> 3:37:02.900]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down
[3:37:02.900 --> 3:37:04.900]  so please pray to keep
[3:37:04.900 --> 3:37:06.900]  info wars on the air

[3:40:24.900 --> 3:40:29.900]  war room which follows up the Alex Jones show every day, live programming lineup
[3:40:29.900 --> 3:40:33.900]  every morning, the American Journal with Harrison Smith, the Alex Jones show and
[3:40:33.900 --> 3:40:37.900]  the war room with yours truly. So I'm gonna take some phone calls right now and
[3:40:37.900 --> 3:40:41.900]  then the phone calls we don't get to will hold over and we'll take them on the
[3:40:41.900 --> 3:40:46.900]  war room and then I will get to the rest of the news that I normally plan on
[3:40:46.900 --> 3:40:52.900]  coming up and then Roger Stone is going to be joining me on the war room as well
[3:40:52.900 --> 3:40:56.900]  and also by the way I think I might as well mention the videos that you've been
[3:40:56.900 --> 3:41:06.900]  seeing that Alex has been playing of Tara Shepansky that is the girl who went to
[3:41:06.900 --> 3:41:11.900]  New York and got rejected from going to a public park because she hadn't been
[3:41:11.900 --> 3:41:17.900]  vaccinated. She will be joining me Sunday night so you can have her first
[3:41:17.900 --> 3:41:22.900]  account, first-hand account on that. Let's go to the phone lines though now and
[3:41:22.900 --> 3:41:27.900]  we go to John called in from Connecticut. John you're on the Alex Jones show go
[3:41:27.900 --> 3:41:37.900]  ahead. Hi, I'm calling so many things I want to talk about but I want to talk about
[3:41:37.900 --> 3:41:45.900]  vaccine shedding today. Many people are becoming ill just by being around
[3:41:45.900 --> 3:41:54.900]  people who have been vaccinated and I just want to offer some things to the
[3:41:54.900 --> 3:42:01.900]  listeners that may be helpful. First of all do not be afraid to contact
[3:42:01.900 --> 3:42:06.900]  America's frontline doctors. They are the only ones that are really will step up
[3:42:06.900 --> 3:42:14.900]  to the plate and help you when you're ill and secondly I want to give recognition
[3:42:14.900 --> 3:42:21.900]  to a very great doctor in the state of Texas who's been a great help. His name
[3:42:21.900 --> 3:42:33.900]  is Dr. Richard Neal, N-E-E-L. He's in the town of Castroville and Dr. Neal has a
[3:42:33.900 --> 3:42:42.900]  protocol of high dose melatonin which I believe saved my life along with the
[3:42:42.900 --> 3:42:50.900]  medication from the American frontline doctors. Dr. Neal has a very long career
[3:42:50.900 --> 3:42:57.900]  in the in the army I believe he retired as a colonel. He was involved in
[3:42:57.900 --> 3:43:03.900]  her work acts. And what is Dr. Neal saying about COVID and or the vaccine?
[3:43:03.900 --> 3:43:11.900]  Well I had the privilege of talking to Dr. Neal for about 20 minutes and he is
[3:43:11.900 --> 3:43:20.900]  saying that he has successfully treated it hundreds and hundreds if not maybe
[3:43:20.900 --> 3:43:24.900]  thousands and I can't it's probably thousands I don't remember exactly what
[3:43:24.900 --> 3:43:34.900]  he said. He's successfully treated many many COVID and COVID shedding patients
[3:43:34.900 --> 3:43:40.900]  through his protocol of high dose melatonin. Dr. Neal was involved in
[3:43:40.900 --> 3:43:48.900]  bio weapons while he was involved in the military and through his experience
[3:43:48.900 --> 3:43:57.900]  in that he came up with his ability to discern that melatonin is one of the
[3:43:57.900 --> 3:44:02.900]  most powerful antioxidants even more powerful. Yeah and of course that's why
[3:44:02.900 --> 3:44:06.900]  you know it's recommended you get eight hours of sleep and because you produce
[3:44:06.900 --> 3:44:10.900]  melatonin when you sleep that's why we we have supplements sleep aid
[3:44:10.900 --> 3:44:14.900]  supplements at infowarstore.com to have the melatonin and you know there's
[3:44:14.900 --> 3:44:18.900]  there's there's other great doctors that I've met here in Texas as well that I've
[3:44:18.900 --> 3:44:22.900]  been to events where they speak I film them the videos are banned on video on
[3:44:22.900 --> 3:44:28.900]  the war room channel and and she would say how she treated a bunch of patients
[3:44:28.900 --> 3:44:32.900]  with COVID and hydroxychloroquine was working with zinc there were there were
[3:44:32.900 --> 3:44:35.900]  other things that were working and she also said that she noticed the people
[3:44:35.900 --> 3:44:39.900]  that that suffered the most were people that were overweight or people that had
[3:44:39.900 --> 3:44:44.900]  pre-existing conditions so it's so it's everything that's been censored off of
[3:44:44.900 --> 3:44:47.900]  the internet and it's those doctors that are getting censored as well because
[3:44:47.900 --> 3:44:50.900]  they're telling the truth and warning people about the vaccine and coming up
[3:44:50.900 --> 3:44:55.900]  on the war room I'm gonna cover how there was a cruise liner that was only
[3:44:55.900 --> 3:45:01.900]  allowing vaccinated people on the cruise and it was filled and they have now had
[3:45:01.900 --> 3:45:05.900]  two people test positive for COVID so it's either it either proves that the
[3:45:05.900 --> 3:45:09.900]  vaccines don't work but the media won't cover it either way John thank you so
[3:45:09.900 --> 3:45:15.900]  much for the call let's go to Jordan in New Jersey Jordan you're on the Alex
[3:45:15.900 --> 3:45:21.900]  Jones show go ahead hi Owen we spoke a week ago I was a former pharmaceutical
[3:45:21.900 --> 3:45:26.900]  information scientist and I just I want to thank you for taking my call again
[3:45:26.900 --> 3:45:32.900]  and also putting up my comments on your site I commend you for that and I just
[3:45:32.900 --> 3:45:38.900]  wanted to reassert and I didn't get this through last time that the COVID-19 had
[3:45:38.900 --> 3:45:43.900]  to be implemented so that they can implement the vaccine that they currently
[3:45:43.900 --> 3:45:50.900]  have to achieve a certain cell mutation in all humans and I know I said to you
[3:45:50.900 --> 3:45:53.900]  that I was trying I'm in the process of doing what you told me to set up the site
[3:45:53.900 --> 3:45:59.900]  with all this data but I wanted to refer to one piece of it that I think everybody
[3:45:59.900 --> 3:46:02.900]  should look at in order to understand this to start to get their heads around
[3:46:02.900 --> 3:46:05.900]  it because I think the only way we win is to really get to the root of what
[3:46:05.900 --> 3:46:08.900]  they're trying to do and why they're doing it from a scientific perspective
[3:46:08.900 --> 3:46:13.900]  that's defense defendable meaning that we can defend it based on scientific
[3:46:13.900 --> 3:46:19.900]  principles and so forth and and what have you so I just wanted to follow up
[3:46:19.900 --> 3:46:24.900]  and point everybody's direction to a Department of Pharmacology member
[3:46:24.900 --> 3:46:29.900]  guiding Bang Lee at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis
[3:46:29.900 --> 3:46:35.900]  and articles that he wrote that are on you know PNAS and PubMed and so forth
[3:46:35.900 --> 3:46:40.900]  the most important of which and this is why COVID-19 was chosen so that they
[3:46:40.900 --> 3:46:45.900]  could have a particular cell mutation that they wanted in order to have future
[3:46:45.900 --> 3:46:49.900]  intrusions to the cell and access the cells it's called structure function and
[3:46:49.900 --> 3:46:56.900]  evolution of coronavirus spike proteins and it most notably it describes
[3:46:56.900 --> 3:47:01.900]  the coronavirus spike protein as a multifunctional molecular machine that
[3:47:01.900 --> 3:47:08.900]  mediates coronavirus entry into host cells and this is the mechanism that they
[3:47:08.900 --> 3:47:12.900]  wanted to have and they had to have COVID because they had to have an excuse
[3:47:12.900 --> 3:47:16.900]  for the scientific community those you know useful idiots who think that they're
[3:47:16.900 --> 3:47:19.900]  trying everybody a favor to get them to go along with this and a lot of the
[3:47:19.900 --> 3:47:25.900]  medical community to think that it's okay to you take the cells like this and
[3:47:25.900 --> 3:47:30.900]  and so it's promoting well and let's be clear either the scientists know this
[3:47:30.900 --> 3:47:34.900]  and the virologist everybody in Fauci knows this and they're criminally liable
[3:47:34.900 --> 3:47:39.900]  or they don't know this and they're criminally negligent so so either way
[3:47:39.900 --> 3:47:42.900]  it's a crime being committed against humanity and the other thing that they
[3:47:42.900 --> 3:47:46.900]  know as well which just makes it even more sick is that they're forcing the
[3:47:46.900 --> 3:47:50.900]  vaccine on everybody and they're saying well we need to have this cap of 80%
[3:47:50.900 --> 3:47:54.900]  or whatever of America vaccinated well they know that the people that already
[3:47:54.900 --> 3:47:59.900]  had COVID that get this vaccine are only going to release more dangerous or
[3:47:59.900 --> 3:48:03.900]  different strains mutant strains whatever they want to say of COVID so they know
[3:48:03.900 --> 3:48:06.900]  all of this they know everything you're talking about or they're criminally
[3:48:06.900 --> 3:48:10.900]  negligent so I mean that's why this is so shocking that they're just going
[3:48:10.900 --> 3:48:14.900]  to release all of this and anybody who's observing or informed like you are is
[3:48:14.900 --> 3:48:18.900]  like hold on how can this be possible?
[3:48:18.900 --> 3:48:23.900]  Yes and it's shocking and I'm trying to let it out in drips and drabs and part of
[3:48:23.900 --> 3:48:26.900]  what I'm calling just to let that go I know and I'm going to build my site and
[3:48:26.900 --> 3:48:30.900]  I'll get back to you guys on that but the thing that I want is that the perpetrators
[3:48:30.900 --> 3:48:34.900]  and this is a big point this is a larger scale point the perpetrators of World War
[3:48:34.900 --> 3:48:39.900]  II actually under it got away and this is a little known thing this is background
[3:48:39.900 --> 3:48:44.900]  how did these apples come back again excuse me my French but how do these people
[3:48:44.900 --> 3:48:49.900]  come back again and essentially what ended up happening was that there were
[3:48:49.900 --> 3:48:53.900]  two Nuremberg trials they're one for the generals who they all hang okay they all
[3:48:53.900 --> 3:48:59.900]  hang except megalith of course or people involved right but and the second
[3:48:59.900 --> 3:49:04.900]  Nuremberg trials were for the people that were involved with the corporate
[3:49:04.900 --> 3:49:09.900]  infrastructure that's heavily detailed in Joseph Borkin's book about the IG
[3:49:09.900 --> 3:49:13.900]  Farben cartel okay all those people got a slap on the wrist none of whom were
[3:49:13.900 --> 3:49:18.900]  hanged they lived in a German villa outside of Berlin and then they all
[3:49:18.900 --> 3:49:23.900]  became heads of major German industries including bare pharmaceuticals and some
[3:49:23.900 --> 3:49:28.900]  of whom later infiltrated US pharmaceutical industry including JD
[3:49:28.900 --> 3:49:34.900]  Ferrell who brought us the first woman's you know contraception pill as well as
[3:49:34.900 --> 3:49:39.900]  Dom Rundfeld running JD Ferrell as just an example so these people have been
[3:49:39.900 --> 3:49:44.900]  lying in wait and slowly unleashing their plan while improving their
[3:49:44.900 --> 3:49:48.900]  technology which is now improved to the level which they're trying to do which is
[3:49:48.900 --> 3:49:52.900]  the access of every human cell and control of the human race but in the meantime
[3:49:52.900 --> 3:49:55.900]  they're also trying to calculate well during this been a great call unfortunately
[3:49:55.900 --> 3:49:59.900]  at the end of the transmission here but ladies and gentlemen will be beginning
[3:49:59.900 --> 3:50:02.900]  the war room as soon as the Alex Jones show concludes but Jordan excellent call
[3:50:02.900 --> 3:50:07.900]  there to finish off and and the other aspect of course is operation paper clip
[3:50:07.900 --> 3:50:11.900]  where the US hired all these Nazi scientists and you know they went on to
[3:50:11.900 --> 3:50:16.900]  work at NASA and everything so it just shows there's a new world order it's big club
[3:50:16.900 --> 3:50:21.900]  and we ain't in it alright that does it for the Alex Jones show remember folks
[3:50:21.900 --> 3:50:26.900]  infowarstore.com if you like my t-shirt here the Tiananmen square t-shirt which is
[3:50:26.900 --> 3:50:31.900]  probably illegal in China you can get it exclusively at infowarstore.com that does
[3:50:31.900 --> 3:50:55.900]  it for the Alex Jones show but the war room kicks off at band.video in 90 seconds.
