[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:36.920]  Texas Alex Jones it is Monday September 6 2011 we're gonna be live here for the
[00:36.920 --> 00:42.160]  next three hours then I'll be back tonight 7 p.m. central 8 p.m. Eastern
[00:42.160 --> 00:48.280]  with info wars nightly news premiering at prisonplanet.tv forward slash news and
[00:48.280 --> 00:57.160]  also info wars news.com all right we have incredible meltdown of the Eurozone by
[00:57.160 --> 01:01.600]  design we told you all this was coming the establishments acting like it was
[01:01.600 --> 01:08.320]  unforeseen the Eurozone is meant to break up they create a union they get
[01:08.320 --> 01:13.040]  countries to waive their rights to that union then they implode that union out
[01:13.040 --> 01:20.280]  of the crisis transfer power to a quote private union private financial system
[01:20.280 --> 01:24.960]  that owns and controls the once sovereign countries it's like a
[01:24.960 --> 01:29.200]  scaffolding around a building was what the EU was same thing with the North
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.000]  American Union we've been in officially for six years the general public
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.280]  doesn't know that the deals have already been signed to merge the EU with the
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.240]  North American Union it's all happening Mexican troops and police are all over
[01:43.240 --> 01:47.280]  the US engaging in police activity finally coming out in mainstream media
[01:47.280 --> 01:54.960]  it's all part of getting rid of sovereignty and just destroying any any
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.880]  chance that there is to ever get control of the global crime bosses because they
[01:59.880 --> 02:05.800]  write the international laws so that's all coming up today obviously I've been
[02:05.800 --> 02:09.280]  getting a lot of phone calls from friends and family some of the worst
[02:09.280 --> 02:16.440]  wildfires in decades in populated areas over a thousand homes now it was just
[02:16.440 --> 02:24.320]  500 yesterday burned down in Austin and outside Austin there is a 20 mile long
[02:24.320 --> 02:32.680]  fire stretching just outside Austin in Bastrop just a few miles from where I'm
[02:32.680 --> 02:38.600]  sitting and government is announcing that they're just letting the fire burn
[02:38.600 --> 02:45.120]  because government can't deal with it government can't and won't protect you
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.520]  the only group that had big enough numbers to accurately assess fires and
[02:50.520 --> 02:58.000]  battle them across the country because they're always happening is the National
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.040]  Guard and then the governor will invite in the guard from other states but in
[03:03.040 --> 03:06.680]  the last six years or so they've been pretty much federalized and they're
[03:06.680 --> 03:13.680]  overseas running checkpoints building fences helping grow opium and helping
[03:13.680 --> 03:18.000]  load on the aircraft and putting it on the news so do you think the globalists
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.120]  want the National Guard helping grow opium that they make 500 billion off
[03:22.120 --> 03:30.280]  of or being dispatched to deal with fires no we do have army here but we're
[03:30.280 --> 03:34.840]  told they're for combat with the American people and we do have a record
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.520]  FEMA and Homeland Security funding but that's for checkpoints and domestic
[03:39.520 --> 03:43.800]  surveillance grids and face-scanning cameras and license plate reading
[03:43.800 --> 03:49.720]  cameras and operations on the streets of America the threat fusion centers
[03:49.720 --> 03:55.400]  federalizing local police oh my gosh though there were big cheers I saw it on
[03:55.400 --> 04:01.120]  the news that Rick Perry returned from the campaign trail and he said listen
[04:01.120 --> 04:07.480]  here Texas is more important I'm here to fight the fires everybody's like we're
[04:07.480 --> 04:14.600]  saved but then we got the news today FEMA was gonna come on Wednesday but now
[04:14.600 --> 04:21.040]  they're coming today we're all saved maybe they'll cut the power off like they
[04:21.040 --> 04:28.280]  did in New Orleans or sabotage the police radios as as as they admittedly
[04:28.280 --> 04:32.560]  did maybe they'll go to high and dry areas and confiscate firearms again I
[04:32.560 --> 04:38.160]  mean everybody's really scared that there's hundreds of fires all around
[04:38.160 --> 04:42.760]  Austin and inside Austin and all areas being evacuated I was watching this
[04:42.760 --> 04:48.200]  weekend from my back porch about three miles away as five helicopters sheriff's
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.400]  Department helicopter the rest of them thank God they're actually doing
[04:50.400 --> 04:54.800]  something worthwhile now flying around scooping water up out of the nearby lake
[04:54.800 --> 04:58.720]  and dumping on the fires look like Mordor Armageddon at night just huge
[04:58.720 --> 05:04.920]  fires a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness
[05:04.920 --> 05:09.320]  the most important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.120]  everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your
[05:13.120 --> 05:16.440]  children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now
[05:16.440 --> 05:19.800]  this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy
[05:19.800 --> 05:24.440]  part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May
[05:24.440 --> 05:28.360]  Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact
[05:28.360 --> 05:33.080]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you

[07:12.640 --> 07:17.640]  home. I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they
[07:17.640 --> 07:22.760]  really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[07:22.760 --> 07:27.120]  citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[07:27.120 --> 07:32.400]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[07:36.640 --> 07:40.200]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[07:40.200 --> 07:45.440]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[08:08.240 --> 08:29.840]  We are live my friends it is Monday the 6th day of September 2011 and I want to
[08:29.840 --> 08:36.000]  get into the big wildfires that are taking place particularly here in
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.560]  central Texas but in different areas of the state and other areas of the
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.560]  country that are parched by a drought the worst that we've seen since the big
[08:44.560 --> 08:52.000]  drought that happened in areas of the Midwest in the 1950s because it's not
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  just about the fires and the thousand plus homes that have been lost it's the
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.640]  fact that from day one it's been confirmed here in our local news that
[09:01.640 --> 09:08.640]  when the fire departments were called on Sunday when all of this began they
[09:08.640 --> 09:14.560]  didn't even respond to the initial fires and showed up hours later once they'd
[09:14.560 --> 09:20.120]  started some of these fires are more than 20 miles long crossing the Colorado
[09:20.120 --> 09:26.160]  River the one that started in Bastrop linked up with two other fires has been
[09:26.160 --> 09:34.200]  the most devastating but this is what happens this is what happens naturally
[09:34.200 --> 09:40.640]  that's why in the old times people would build a fire break or basically a four
[09:40.640 --> 09:48.840]  to six foot mound of dirt or rock around their home place and when droughts
[09:48.840 --> 09:55.560]  came people basically would then put goats in around their house and have
[09:55.560 --> 10:00.800]  them eat the grass down to the rock and then turn the goats out outside the rock
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.200]  fence you drive around anywhere in central Texas which is prone to drought
[10:04.200 --> 10:10.680]  off and on and you see the little rock walls around the houses that's that's to
[10:10.680 --> 10:17.760]  keep fire out that's a fire break also old-timers knew that you needed to cut
[10:17.760 --> 10:22.640]  big strips of timber and fire breaks along property lines and they would go
[10:22.640 --> 10:27.480]  to their neighbors and say hey Bob let's let's work together and cut down this
[10:27.480 --> 10:34.680]  timber but nowadays it's frowned upon to cut fire breaks you go out west they
[10:34.680 --> 10:44.560]  have just incredible fires Montana Utah Wyoming Colorado Nevada Arizona New
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.560]  Mexico because the US Forest Service in some of those states has control of more
[10:49.560 --> 10:55.800]  than 85 percent of the land and they will not allow any of that timber to be
[10:55.800 --> 11:01.800]  removed when it falls over and it is just gigantic gigantic piles in some
[11:01.800 --> 11:07.720]  cases of a hundred years of dead wood and when it lights up it's just amazing
[11:07.720 --> 11:12.200]  then the Forest Service will attempt to go out and fight it thus not letting it
[11:12.200 --> 11:17.920]  burn out and so once you get 30 40 50 60 mile an hour winds and lightning strikes
[11:17.920 --> 11:24.360]  when it's dry it causes unnatural infernos to just roll you know growing up
[11:24.360 --> 11:31.480]  here in Texas every spring the sunsets are incredibly red and gorgeous and a
[11:31.480 --> 11:34.640]  lot of times you can even smell the smoke and see it in the sky from Mexico
[11:34.640 --> 11:38.560]  because the winds are blowing from the south of the north and they're burning
[11:38.560 --> 11:44.320]  their fields controlled burns because it puts nitrogen and other key minerals
[11:44.320 --> 11:50.760]  and and fertilizers back into the soil that's how old-fashioned agriculture is
[11:50.760 --> 11:57.400]  done minus the chemicals and you see that so so fire is a natural part and
[11:57.400 --> 12:02.640]  there's all this incredible fear mongering I talked to neighbors I talked
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.960]  to people at the store because I was basically surrounded by the fires I live
[12:07.960 --> 12:16.720]  out west of Austin and there was just smoke in in all directions you could see
[12:16.720 --> 12:21.000]  it billowing up beautiful blue skies as the cold front blew in and we went from
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.960]  about 110 degrees on average to 58 last night but during the day it's gonna get
[12:25.960 --> 12:32.880]  up into the 80s just gorgeous blue skies but billowing on the horizon big black
[12:32.880 --> 12:38.440]  thunderheads that were not thunderheads but that were gigantic fires this is
[12:38.440 --> 12:44.600]  natural if you read what Lewis and Clark wrote about seeing big big prairie
[12:44.600 --> 12:48.960]  fires and and forest fires on the horizon and big black what appeared to
[12:48.960 --> 12:55.880]  be thunderheads but warrant were smoke if you read what any of the accounts of
[12:55.880 --> 13:02.720]  natives were that was a big issue was fire from lightning strikes and that's
[13:02.720 --> 13:08.600]  why there is more timber now in North America than there was 100 years ago
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.720]  before because most areas didn't have timber because it had been burned out
[13:12.720 --> 13:18.000]  from lightning strikes humans come in pump water to the surface from the
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.520]  aquifers irrigate in these droughts where do you see the animals I've got
[13:23.520 --> 13:28.000]  like 50 turkeys in my yard every day deer everywhere and we've got a little
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.920]  plastic swimming pool we fill up and they come and drink out of it but but the
[13:32.920 --> 13:37.640]  point is people always demonize human activity and I've heard Al Gore he says
[13:37.640 --> 13:44.320]  the hurricane hit New York because of human activity he's of course saying
[13:44.320 --> 13:50.920]  the wildfires are humans every time a dust storm blows in in Australia which
[13:50.920 --> 13:54.920]  they've always had there from the interior Australia's only green around
[13:54.920 --> 14:00.000]  the edges the coastal areas they get on the news and say pay us carbon taxes it
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.360]  would it will fix everything literally just pay government money and you won't
[14:05.360 --> 14:12.920]  have a red dirt dust storm anymore California had one a few years ago and
[14:13.480 --> 14:20.880]  the politically incorrect guy got up there on his show on HBO Bill Maher and
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.400]  said this is global warming I mean that's like saying you slipped and broke
[14:26.400 --> 14:29.840]  your leg because God's mad at you not because you didn't look where you were
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.080]  stepping it's it's they talk to you like your five-year-old children so I
[14:36.080 --> 14:44.000]  want to break something down here a this is natural this area that's why if you
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.800]  look at a map of the vegetation in Texas it's green from East Texas out of
[14:49.800 --> 14:53.880]  Louisiana Mississippi some areas are almost tropical there's swamps with
[14:53.880 --> 14:58.440]  alligators the whole nine yards like some areas are listed as what they call
[14:58.440 --> 15:05.440]  it subtropical tropical lily pads you know a hundred thousand acres swamp
[15:05.440 --> 15:12.760]  rivers lakes amazing and as you move towards the middle of the state and
[15:12.760 --> 15:18.440]  cross about the Austin line west it starts getting drier and drier and
[15:18.440 --> 15:23.160]  drier you drive 50 miles outside Austin say northwest suddenly you're in scrub
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.280]  brush and cactuses everywhere you're having other hundred miles you're in
[15:26.280 --> 15:34.400]  desert and they're on the news saying this is global warming Texas is like
[15:34.400 --> 15:41.360]  this because of human activity ladies and gentlemen Texas has always been
[15:41.360 --> 15:46.840]  arid from Austin over everything's green right up to Austin and then you roll
[15:46.840 --> 15:51.400]  off down into the hills that go that start turning into mountains and up
[15:51.400 --> 15:57.960]  towards the North Plains Desert down towards the south you can go down into
[15:57.960 --> 16:02.960]  the you know the Southwest you can go out into Big Bend where they filmed a
[16:02.960 --> 16:08.200]  lot of Westerns with John Wayne they went there to film Western movies based
[16:08.200 --> 16:12.640]  in deserts because it's always been a desert paying Al Gore money isn't going
[16:12.640 --> 16:17.800]  to change that and people move in and build in the middle of on the edge of a
[16:17.800 --> 16:22.040]  desert when there's a drought this area is turning into a desert right now it's
[16:22.040 --> 16:28.280]  always happened happened in the 50s there are the medians in some areas the
[16:28.280 --> 16:32.080]  grass has been dead for a few months some areas the grass is blown away and
[16:32.080 --> 16:38.400]  there's desert it's turning into a desert and as soon as it starts raining and
[16:38.400 --> 16:44.560]  goes back into that cycle then it will rain all those seeds it's gonna look
[16:44.560 --> 16:48.400]  like a flower jungle because of all this when the plants start dying they all
[16:48.400 --> 16:53.840]  drop the seeds they say well I'm a plant that lives in a semi-arid area time to
[16:53.840 --> 16:59.120]  go I'm gonna put a bunch of flowers off I'm dead they die the seeds are there
[16:59.120 --> 17:04.480]  rain hits it it's gonna look like a tropical rainforest here you know I've
[17:04.480 --> 17:10.320]  lived in Austin when the dam was about to break out at Lake Travis and it was
[17:10.320 --> 17:15.240]  raining every day for three four months straight and the these asphalt roads
[17:15.240 --> 17:20.240]  were falling apart because of all the rain and oh my gosh but I'm digressing
[17:20.240 --> 17:24.960]  I'm gonna get to the economy the huge police state news we've got Gerald
[17:24.960 --> 17:28.200]  Salente again I'm having him on a lot because he's accurately broken down what
[17:28.200 --> 17:33.160]  would come the fact that even mainstream media is saying total collapse is
[17:33.160 --> 17:39.000]  possible as we reported last week Goldman Sachs is betting on the economy
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.640]  totally imploding and quietly telling their top investors and insiders to do
[17:42.640 --> 17:45.320]  that while telling their general customers everything's going to be
[17:45.320 --> 17:52.080]  absolutely fabulous and we've got some other important news dealing with Al

[24:50.980 --> 24:57.400]  calls but continuing with the news I want to play a short clip of Rick Perry
[24:57.400 --> 25:04.520]  in a press conference yesterday and he was asked what about your campaign he
[25:04.520 --> 25:10.400]  had he'd canceled a event and he said hey you know I really want to take care
[25:10.400 --> 25:15.960]  of Texas there's lives at risk and it's so fake now he puts on this whole John
[25:15.960 --> 25:22.240]  Wayne slash Ronald Reagan type look on his face he's such a phony that's what's
[25:22.240 --> 25:27.480]  disgusting of course he ran back for a national photo op he's all over national
[25:27.480 --> 25:32.200]  television right now going let me tell you campaign in the secondary to get in
[25:32.200 --> 25:39.320]  here to Texas and saving people as if Rick Perry because they all cheer as if
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.760]  Rick Perry magically he's here he's gonna save us but they were even bigger
[25:43.760 --> 25:51.280]  cheers today FEMA FEMA is out there FEMA is out there with the fires they oh my
[25:51.280 --> 25:56.800]  gosh you know every time FEMA shows up as Ron Paul pointed out they make
[25:56.800 --> 25:59.800]  everybody stand down for four or five days well they get you under their
[25:59.800 --> 26:04.800]  chain of command and while they run every project through themselves and
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.200]  then everything completely breaks down FEMA it's been proven cannot fight
[26:09.200 --> 26:13.240]  fires has done a terrible job cannot help people during flooding all they can
[26:13.240 --> 26:17.320]  do is go to high and dry areas and confiscate firearms but don't worry
[26:17.320 --> 26:22.840]  Rick Perry is begging for FEMA oh FEMA come save us why doesn't Rick Perry talk
[26:22.840 --> 26:27.000]  about the elephant in the room in fact I I saw it in the Austin American States
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  when this weekend that getting National Guard back to Texas to fight fires is
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.280]  harder than you think most of them are overseas fighting Al Qaeda yes fighting
[26:37.280 --> 26:42.960]  to grow the opium so see the National Guard is assigned the governor should
[26:42.960 --> 26:48.240]  have a big National Guard he doesn't have hardly any because they're overseas in
[26:48.240 --> 26:52.320]  all these wars all these little fire departments are trying to band together
[26:52.320 --> 26:58.560]  when you get 20 mile long fires and 40 50 mile an hour wind of course government
[26:58.560 --> 27:02.200]  came out and said just evacuate all we can do send police to your area to tell
[27:02.200 --> 27:06.000]  you evacuate and then government didn't have any ways to make announcements
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.320]  except for breaking in on 590 a.m. was some robot voice you couldn't even
[27:11.320 --> 27:17.600]  understand guess who had real coverage and help people evacuate all over 590 a.m.
[27:17.600 --> 27:22.360]  that's who I listened to Sunday and yesterday TV was bumbling around and
[27:22.360 --> 27:27.440]  couldn't get anything done radio because it's unscripted they had the fire
[27:27.440 --> 27:32.880]  people calling in firefighters police citizens reports and then we learned
[27:32.880 --> 27:38.760]  Sunday evening Steiner Ranch is on fire there are flames shooting up hundreds of
[27:38.760 --> 27:43.160]  feet in the air they evacuate everyone and then leave the old folks home there's
[27:43.160 --> 27:47.520]  a whole old folks community there just left them there but don't worry all the
[27:47.520 --> 27:52.160]  liberals went to the dog shelters and bass drop in other areas and had the
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.200]  news and in people out there braving fire to save the animals and the old
[27:57.200 --> 28:01.320]  folks were left as the flames approached and people want oh we better save the old
[28:01.320 --> 28:03.680]  people
[28:04.400 --> 28:08.040]  you know the old people they don't matter leave them and start a ranch while
[28:08.040 --> 28:10.880]  it's burning last time I checked they're now trying to get them out a day and a
[28:10.880 --> 28:15.480]  half later and then oh my gosh fire actually wasn't anywhere near this
[28:15.480 --> 28:20.280]  bass drop a pet facility but there were all these trendies out there because
[28:20.280 --> 28:26.640]  they've been caught with their pants down but governments always caught with
[28:26.640 --> 28:32.280]  its pants down government can't protect you won't protect you the idea that
[28:32.280 --> 28:39.400]  who Rick Perry has returned in a purple shirt to save us the idea that FEMA is
[28:39.400 --> 28:44.880]  here I mean when FEMA shows up look out now the National Guard they've been
[28:44.880 --> 28:49.560]  fighting fires for decades and decades and decades they actually know what to
[28:49.560 --> 28:56.160]  do control burns bulldozers fire burns you name it let's see they are not here
[28:56.160 --> 28:59.400]  anymore their numbers have been reduced by more than 90 percent we do have a
[28:59.400 --> 29:04.760]  military here though let's but but it's the quote deal with domestic extremist
[29:04.760 --> 29:09.400]  let's go ahead and play this Perry Club here it is you know I'll be realized
[29:09.400 --> 29:12.680]  way I'm not paying any attention to politics right now there's plenty of
[29:12.680 --> 29:16.680]  time to take care of that people's lives and their possessions are in danger
[29:16.680 --> 29:25.080]  that's substantially more important I actually saw the video on your news now
[29:25.080 --> 29:30.640]  of him in the fake face all all we could find was a news clip showing burning
[29:30.640 --> 29:37.680]  burning structures and then smoke in the sky but it's even more ridiculous
[29:37.680 --> 29:41.800]  watching how fake he is I mean the body language this is a guy that's for force
[29:41.800 --> 29:45.400]  inoculations of a deadly shot of the little girls this is a guy who wanted to
[29:45.400 --> 29:49.920]  hand over 8,000 miles of Texas roads criminally to a foreign company we're

[32:03.560 --> 32:07.520]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[32:07.520 --> 32:11.800]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[32:11.800 --> 32:16.040]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[32:16.040 --> 32:20.400]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[32:20.400 --> 32:24.520]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[32:24.520 --> 32:29.040]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[32:29.040 --> 32:33.160]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[32:33.160 --> 32:37.160]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[32:37.160 --> 32:40.920]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[32:40.920 --> 32:43.640]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[32:43.640 --> 32:48.920]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[32:48.920 --> 32:53.400]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[32:53.400 --> 33:10.040]  sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 leading a frontal
[33:10.040 --> 33:16.040]  assault on the lives of the new world order it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[33:16.040 --> 33:27.160]  radio network
[33:27.160 --> 33:33.200]  all right let me finish up with the unprecedented wildfires in and around
[33:33.200 --> 33:38.360]  Austin Texas Jaren was pointing out during the break I might want to be
[33:38.360 --> 33:44.040]  specific maybe one half of one percent of our audience knows what Steiner Ranch
[33:44.040 --> 33:49.880]  is or Bastrop east of town they've got a 20 mile long fire then now over a
[33:49.880 --> 33:55.040]  thousand houses burned down they've got scores of other smaller fires all
[33:55.040 --> 34:02.040]  around the city and inside the city Steiner Ranch is an upscale area out on
[34:02.040 --> 34:10.840]  the Colorado River just down from the large dam and Lake Travis that's really
[34:10.840 --> 34:15.760]  the damned up Colorado River and they've had a bunch of homes destroyed over
[34:15.760 --> 34:24.400]  there that was an old folks community within it and no one at first thought
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.280]  to even try to get them out because they were too busy all over the place
[34:28.280 --> 34:33.600]  evacuating animals out of shelters that weren't even in danger it's always the
[34:33.600 --> 34:39.480]  same because humans have been dehumanized in people's eyes human life
[34:39.480 --> 34:44.280]  doesn't have a lot of value remember all the snuff videos the Marines and the
[34:44.280 --> 34:48.520]  army released of shooting men women and children for fun running over cars
[34:48.520 --> 34:54.320]  laughing about it playing Elvis music while they shoot innocent people but
[34:54.320 --> 34:58.400]  then those Marines threw that puppy off a cliff and it turned out it was real
[34:58.400 --> 35:03.440]  video and they got court-martialed and everything it's because you haven't been
[35:03.440 --> 35:09.560]  taught to hate animals you've been taught to hate fellow humans you've been
[35:09.560 --> 35:15.720]  desensitized by seeing literally millions of simulated deaths of humans in
[35:15.720 --> 35:20.160]  dramas and TV shows and movies I've seen reports of the average person sees
[35:20.160 --> 35:25.440]  thousands of simulated violent acts per week and your brain takes that on as
[35:25.440 --> 35:31.400]  real your brain accepts all of that information bombarding and as if it's
[35:31.400 --> 35:36.920]  real so when you just see a real person dying it doesn't upset you anymore you
[35:36.920 --> 35:40.760]  know that's why my dad's dad was a world war two vet and saw a lot of people
[35:40.760 --> 35:46.720]  died he never liked violent TV shows he never you know he was a rancher and you
[35:46.720 --> 35:49.520]  know tough guy and everything but he didn't like violent TV shows he didn't
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.720]  like shows with people getting shot and blood dripping out of their mouth a few
[35:54.720 --> 35:58.640]  times he'd take my dad and his brother to see a movie in town and it would be
[35:58.640 --> 36:03.520]  violent he'd get up and leave and it wasn't that he was a wimp it was that
[36:03.520 --> 36:09.640]  he'd seen the piles of dead bodies he'd seen dead bodies he'd and it wasn't fun
[36:09.640 --> 36:15.200]  see he hadn't been brought up on death and destruction and violence on TV then
[36:15.200 --> 36:19.680]  he'd gone and seen the real thing and so when he saw it simulated it brought up
[36:19.680 --> 36:30.440]  bad memories okay and it's the opposite today you're brought up on violence and
[36:30.440 --> 36:35.000]  the major studies show now when you go see real violence or you go to war
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.720]  you're not concerned anymore you've you've you've lost some of your
[36:39.720 --> 36:50.800]  humanity and and people would call that being tough no it's not being tough you
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.560]  see if you've been natural and not experienced violence but then experience
[36:55.560 --> 37:00.640]  the real thing but then experience simulation you don't like it but if
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.600]  you've been shown simulated violence and then you've shown the real thing you
[37:05.600 --> 37:09.960]  either don't care or you like it you understand how how important that is who
[37:09.960 --> 37:14.360]  developed all the shoot them up games for the military in the 60s the first
[37:14.360 --> 37:21.200]  video games were government financed shoot them ups just with pop-ups they
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.680]  noticed with police that instinctive shooting with pop-up paper then it moved
[37:25.680 --> 37:31.160]  to digital images and it went from in World War one more than half the troops
[37:31.160 --> 37:36.880]  up close wouldn't shoot a fellow soldier because they saw him as a human being
[37:36.880 --> 37:41.640]  there was a human compulsion to not want to kill him and when you did kill
[37:41.640 --> 37:46.640]  somebody up close a lot of times you would throw up after if you were sitting
[37:46.640 --> 37:51.200]  around with some dead bodies nowadays on average people pose with them they get
[37:51.200 --> 37:57.280]  excited they like it because they were shown millions of simulated violence
[37:57.280 --> 38:03.200]  actions in the culture without the smell of blood without the pain without the
[38:03.200 --> 38:09.200]  smell of pheromones and death without all the danger without the humanity so it
[38:09.200 --> 38:13.280]  was like popcorn it was entertainment then when you go see the real violence
[38:13.280 --> 38:18.880]  you either don't care or like it see how it's flipped simulated makes you not
[38:18.880 --> 38:25.720]  care or like the violence see real violence then you never like simulated
[38:25.720 --> 38:32.880]  you understand that again everything is psychology more and more I realize the
[38:32.880 --> 38:37.520]  globalist absolutely in their own words are engaged in a psychological warfare
[38:37.520 --> 38:44.400]  operation against free humanity but I'm digressing all people in Austin can
[38:44.400 --> 38:50.240]  think about with fires in the city and outside the city was running and just
[38:50.240 --> 38:55.280]  seeing if they could say you know use the downtown animal shelter in danger is
[38:55.280 --> 39:03.720]  the shelter in Bastrop in danger and I saw in some of the cases we adopted 100%
[39:03.720 --> 39:08.360]  of the animals and so they kind of use it as a gimmick hey yeah we've got all
[39:08.360 --> 39:13.200]  these animals they could burn up the fires are five miles away and everybody
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.760]  shows up to adopt the animals meanwhile old folks with fire 300 yards away it's
[39:18.760 --> 39:25.680]  like I've just enjoy yourselves because you've been taught to disdain them the
[39:25.680 --> 39:32.320]  Romans 2000 plus years ago knew this they knew that when you showed simulated
[39:32.320 --> 39:39.080]  combat is how the gladiatorial stuff began with wooden spears and wooden
[39:39.080 --> 39:44.720]  swords then the rich started saying I actually want my slaves to fight to death
[39:44.720 --> 39:50.600]  for my entertainment or at the death of the leader of the house they would have
[39:50.600 --> 39:55.240]  a few slaves kill each other as a human sacrifice it was a stylized but
[39:55.240 --> 39:59.680]  nevertheless human sacrifice and then it was rich people wanted their own
[39:59.680 --> 40:03.520]  private party people killing each other and then they started getting the
[40:03.520 --> 40:07.880]  public into it and finally the entire culture was based around the
[40:07.880 --> 40:13.080]  dehumanizing sports and the more corrupt society the more poor they got the
[40:13.080 --> 40:17.600]  more they put into the gladiatorial game because you could go and cheer to
[40:17.600 --> 40:22.680]  decide the gladiator lived or died if he was on his back cut up you had power
[40:22.680 --> 40:25.520]  and you didn't care if it was your neighbor thrown in there next week
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.080]  because at least you got to be part of it and then your neighbor didn't care if
[40:29.080 --> 40:36.760]  you were thrown in there next week and that's all this is is a dehumanization
[40:36.760 --> 40:42.000]  and like signpost on the road to perdition we know exactly where this is
[40:42.000 --> 40:48.440]  leading us so what did Katrina teach us what did the situation in New York
[40:48.440 --> 40:54.480]  teaches what did these fires teach us that the that the greenies are not green
[40:54.480 --> 41:00.480]  at all and they'll seize on any event to try to sell you on letting them run your
[41:00.480 --> 41:12.400]  life that's going on but more importantly we've learned government can't and
[41:12.400 --> 41:17.560]  won't protect you they can't protect you so of course they're not going to
[41:17.560 --> 41:21.240]  protect you in fact in every one of these emergencies I've looked at them I've
[41:21.240 --> 41:27.200]  studied them disaster relief science admits this it's the local fire
[41:27.200 --> 41:31.840]  department it's the local police it's the local volunteer fire department it's
[41:31.840 --> 41:36.680]  the state police it's the locals that are fighting the fires FEMA shows up and
[41:36.680 --> 41:40.840]  bosses everybody around they've now shown up took FEMA three days to show up
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.640]  and now what are they doing they're calling everybody in to boss everybody
[41:45.640 --> 41:51.240]  around and tell them what to do in the chain of command instead of fighting the
[41:51.240 --> 41:57.880]  fires and now some of the fires are getting worse Austin is encircled by a
[41:57.880 --> 42:01.800]  ring of fire that they're just in any direction if you get up on a rooftop
[42:01.800 --> 42:07.000]  there's big black clouds like like a war is going on there's seen all black and
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.600]  white footage of World War two out on the eastern front where the Germans and
[42:10.600 --> 42:14.400]  the Russians are fighting each other and they just smoke across the horizon or in
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.240]  all directions I've seen old-color film of it exactly what it looks like it's
[42:19.240 --> 42:24.280]  prairie fires it happens but now there's people built up in along it and
[42:24.280 --> 42:31.280]  some of the only natural fire breaks of the fire are people's irrigated homes
[42:31.280 --> 42:35.000]  what have they done in response to the fire they've ordered most people to not
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.400]  water period oh that's a really good idea the aquifer still has a lot of water
[42:39.400 --> 42:45.080]  in it the lakes to have a lot of water in it their answer is don't water I
[42:45.080 --> 42:50.000]  even heard them on the news saying because the the the fire trucks need the
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.080]  water ladies and gentlemen one of the only areas that hasn't burned down in
[42:54.080 --> 42:59.680]  the fire line in Bastrop is the lost pines golf course which is irrigated
[42:59.680 --> 43:04.520]  seven days a week in the surrounding area though they tell everybody you can
[43:04.520 --> 43:08.600]  water every two weeks in Bastrop or maybe every week depending on your you
[43:08.600 --> 43:14.760]  know depending on your zip code and so what are they doing they should be
[43:14.760 --> 43:19.280]  saying everybody irrigate everything irrigate what wet everything down at
[43:19.280 --> 43:28.080]  night no their answer is don't wait till everything burns down so that's how they
[43:28.080 --> 43:32.160]  operate there are some areas of West Texas out in the desert where they have
[43:32.160 --> 43:37.800]  oil towns and mining towns and there they are running out in the in there in
[43:37.800 --> 43:41.680]  their municipal thousand foot two thousand foot wells what's the answer
[43:41.680 --> 43:46.560]  drill deeper but they've always run out of water they live in the desert here we
[43:46.560 --> 43:50.800]  have giant aquifers everywhere but see most of those aquifers have been bought
[43:50.800 --> 43:55.600]  out by big trans nationals who want to just be able to charge you more so they
[43:55.600 --> 44:00.760]  say we've taken over your your your public utility now we say use less of
[44:00.760 --> 44:04.520]  our product and by the way we're doubling prices because by the way we're
[44:04.520 --> 44:13.120]  selling Austin water that the LCRA is sold out to Houston I've got articles
[44:13.120 --> 44:17.800]  here about the National Health Service being privatized in England oh they've
[44:17.800 --> 44:21.840]  already done tests you think an 18 month wait on a brain tumor that's a hundred
[44:21.840 --> 44:26.120]  percent operable in one month but almost zero percent operable a death sentence
[44:26.120 --> 44:29.720]  within six months you don't like waiting 18 months for that and dying how about
[44:29.720 --> 44:35.920]  two and a half years German companies other companies coming in taking over
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.280]  their National Health Service this is globalism this is how you get conquered
[44:40.280 --> 44:44.240]  economically you pay for the lakes to be built you pay for the dams to be built
[44:44.240 --> 44:48.840]  you pay to have the power plants built your money pays for it it's low prices
[44:48.840 --> 44:54.240]  and they sell it out in every case and double or triple prices and tell you it's
[44:54.240 --> 45:04.720]  for carbon taxes which it has nothing to do with but don't worry when they shut
[45:04.720 --> 45:11.640]  down Texas power plants all over the place and don't let new ones open don't
[45:11.640 --> 45:15.560]  worry we'll just get our power from Mexico like we now do large portions of
[45:15.560 --> 45:20.720]  it where they have no environmental controls on the stacks you go look at
[45:20.720 --> 45:26.560]  Mexican power plants online they're just a small building in a big smokestack they
[45:26.560 --> 45:29.840]  don't have the whole extra building that's the scrubber that's got in some
[45:29.840 --> 45:33.440]  cases hundreds of miles of tubing and tanks and everything they send it through
[45:33.440 --> 45:37.680]  where nothing comes out but carbon dioxide and water vapor no no no no it's
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.120]  gonna off gas all that mercury and lead send it right over in clouds over Texas
[45:42.120 --> 45:49.200]  where I live but nobody cares because it's fun to get cheated alright I've
[45:49.200 --> 45:56.160]  already digressed off into this long enough but if you are in central Texas
[45:56.160 --> 45:59.800]  we're gonna open the phones up just for you after I get into some of the other
[45:59.800 --> 46:04.880]  news I want to hear your view on the wildfires here or if you're out west and
[46:04.880 --> 46:09.320]  have seen the admitted National Forest Service mitigation program where they
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.600]  don't let you cut fire breaks where they own over 80% of land in most of those
[46:13.600 --> 46:17.560]  western states and the devastation that's wreaked they don't even deny that
[46:17.560 --> 46:22.920]  that's happened that's on record what do you think you feel safer Rick Perry for
[46:22.920 --> 46:26.680]  another photo op has shown up to hand everything over to FEMA why isn't Rick
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.880]  Perry saying where is our National Guard why is over 90% of it oversees building
[46:31.880 --> 46:35.160]  fences in other people's countries running checkpoints instead of on our
[46:35.160 --> 46:40.320]  border and growing opium I can show you newscast the National Guard growing
[46:40.320 --> 46:45.760]  opium how did you let Rick Perry six years ago and then completely four years
[46:45.760 --> 46:49.560]  ago with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act why did you let the
[46:49.560 --> 46:55.600]  government take the National Guard away from the states Mr. Tenth Amendment
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.000]  Mr. States rights we know you were Al Gore's Chief of Staff in Texas we know
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.040]  in 93 and 94 you endorsed Hillary Carran said we needed National Health
[47:04.040 --> 47:07.720]  Service we know you support forest inoculation handing over our
[47:07.720 --> 47:13.120]  infrastructure go to Bilderberg we know your you like to go to transvestite
[47:13.120 --> 47:18.540]  bars that that that much is admitted on your expense account I understand
[47:18.540 --> 47:22.320]  Bohemian Grove it's of the Lord you don't get elected as a Republican
[47:22.320 --> 47:26.120]  president I guess Ron Paul doesn't dress in women's clothing so he doesn't get
[47:26.120 --> 47:30.960]  to be president I understand all the simpering limp-rested fake
[47:30.960 --> 47:35.800]  conservatives on talk radio will probably get to destroy America as they
[47:35.800 --> 47:40.600]  pose as conservatives to fool real constitutionalists into loving you with
[47:40.600 --> 47:47.840]  your fake black to pay I've had it I've had it with you make me sick and Mitt
[47:47.840 --> 47:52.120]  Romney is almost as bad he was not Al Gore Chief of Staff he does support
[47:52.120 --> 47:57.280]  carbon taxes and he did support National Health Service I mean you let me tell
[47:57.280 --> 48:00.880]  you something I listened to mainline neocon radio and I want to throw up as
[48:00.880 --> 48:03.800]  they talk about the evils of the Democrats and the idiocy of the
[48:03.800 --> 48:08.280]  Democrats all day long and sure that's a bunch of bamboozled morons on average
[48:08.280 --> 48:12.000]  who think the government's gonna give them a free lunch oh thank you mr.
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.120]  president I get a free car now I get free mortgages now oh thank you and
[48:16.120 --> 48:19.720]  Obama went along with it when old ladies and people would say thank God I get
[48:19.720 --> 48:23.880]  everything free now he sat there and smiled at him like a wolf looking at a
[48:23.880 --> 48:30.000]  at a at a at a at a addled sheep that it was about to eat but but but but you
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.080]  humane line conservatives who like to snicker and make fun of Ron Paul like
[48:35.080 --> 48:41.920]  to call him a kook and like to doddle around and toddle around like morons
[48:42.200 --> 48:54.640]  and I hear him calling in I like to a lot Mitt Romney that Paul can't win I mean
[48:54.640 --> 48:58.800]  was there never a con job you didn't buy into was there ever a scam you didn't
[48:58.800 --> 49:04.160]  fall but see you don't care you like feeling like you're a winner saving the
[49:04.160 --> 49:08.120]  dollar saving our manufacturing saving the Second Amendment saving our future
[49:08.120 --> 49:12.440]  doesn't matter to you you like to go to your Republican country clubs or go to
[49:12.440 --> 49:16.800]  your good old boy events or or go hear your state rep speak who's a main line
[49:16.800 --> 49:22.440]  Republican and feel official or you like a little letter you get sent by from
[49:22.440 --> 49:26.480]  Republican fundraisers of your favorite candidate hand signed by them which
[49:26.480 --> 49:33.320]  isn't and and you like feeling like we're gonna get that Obama you're gonna be in
[49:33.320 --> 49:38.320]  power soon oh we're gonna show these Obama people it's the same thing the
[49:38.320 --> 49:41.760]  idiot Obama supporters thought they thought they were buying into their
[49:41.760 --> 49:46.400]  guy and that their president was in there and they got personal power through
[49:46.400 --> 49:50.160]  it the very same mega banks that have set up the world government the
[49:50.160 --> 49:57.240]  corporate receivership system meant to destroy every form of sovereignty those
[49:57.240 --> 50:05.400]  very groups are the ones that are financing Rick Perry they're the same
[50:05.400 --> 50:09.600]  ones that finance John McCain they're the same ones that are gonna finance
[50:09.600 --> 50:15.120]  Obama again this round if you go with an establishment candidate their rhetoric
[50:15.120 --> 50:19.320]  doesn't matter their actions are what matters and Mitt Romney and Rick Perry
[50:19.320 --> 50:25.320]  scream at you that they're basically Republican Al Gore's or Bill Clinton's and
[50:25.320 --> 50:30.840]  you're so weak-minded I remember six months ago a year ago telling you some
[50:30.840 --> 50:34.800]  of you mainline Republicans that that Rick Perry worked for Al Gore that Rick
[50:34.800 --> 50:38.880]  Perry supported carbon taxes and so did Mitt Romney and I got your email saying
[50:38.880 --> 50:43.960]  I was a liar and I saw the news article saying I work for Obama you people are
[50:43.960 --> 50:49.160]  truly morons I work for the American people in the Republic and common sense

[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:39.840]  Alex Jones
[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:45.280]  okay we are back live into our number two thank you so much for joining us
[1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:50.320]  today I spent a lot of the first hour getting into the wildfires all over
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:55.360]  Texas destroying more than a thousand homes just in the central Texas area and
[1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:59.160]  I was illustrating government can't and won't protect you certainly FEMA won't
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:05.880]  and we have a lot of folks calling in from Texas on the wildfires I want to go
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:09.040]  to people coming up in the next segment so we don't get interrupted then we'll
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:14.560]  talk to Sarah in Wyoming a fire EMT I'm gonna get to everybody just make your
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:18.600]  point we'll move on to the next person of course I threw the question out do you
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:23.760]  feel a lot safer now that Rick Perry has returned from campaigning to save you
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:28.040]  from the fires as if government could people were cheering yeah he's here
[1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:34.240]  he'll fix it and then meanwhile he turns stuff over to FEMA he should be saying I
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:39.640]  want our National Guard back here because the only force coordinating with
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:44.120]  firefighters that's ever been able to stop really big 20 mile long fires is the
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:47.840]  National Guard they've got the tens of thousands of people in the old days there
[1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:51.880]  were some of the best firefighters in the world because they just find them 24
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:58.520]  seven all over the US but in a way that's actually made things more dangerous
[1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:05.960]  because now you've got all this dead fuel lying around across the country we've
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:09.760]  got more trees now than we had a hundred years ago we had more many
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:14.040]  historians believe than we ever had because you know normally wildfires but
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:20.160]  from from lightning strikes meteor strikes they come in hot and cause fires
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:24.880]  would burn out huge swaths of the United States but now they've said no
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:31.600]  wildfires are not normal Al Gore says pay him money and he will fix it any time
[1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:35.080]  there's a hurricane why the this has never happened before of course New York
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:38.960]  gets it all the time by hurricanes just just incredible fear monitoring so I
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:46.600]  want your take on all of that coming up a drudge report has been responded to by

[1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:22.800]  be actually structured and joke about it but but Janet Pat Napolitano says
[1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:29.080]  that drudge is just wrong no big sis is just wrong and Matt drudge is just

[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:23.600]  currency devalued because it continues to go up and up as all other major global
[1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:27.680]  currencies are devalued they claim they're going to buy other world
[1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:34.560]  currencies to try to prop them up against the swiss frank just just just
[1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:39.440]  huge developments on that front also max keiser popping in from europe and we're
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:44.640]  watching the u.s. stock market as it plunges as well as gold goes up to 1900
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:51.960]  it is all coming up today but right now let's go to damien the damien called in
[1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:55.160]  first but he's from south carolina let's talk about wall fires let's go to
[1:10:55.160 --> 1:11:00.240]  somebody in texas first let's go ahead and go to john in texas on the wall
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:06.440]  fires go ahead you're welcome to be on the show hi hi elix yes go ahead okay
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:09.600]  one thing i've noticed about this drought since it started and i only talk
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:14.800]  for the houston area that the lack of chemtrails in the sky except the few
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:18.920]  times we've had a brief shower here maybe like 15 20 minutes i would see
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:24.320]  maybe one two chemtrails in the sky and either that night or the next day we get
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:29.240]  a brief shower but other than that no chemtrails before the drought the
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:33.080]  chemtrail to crap out of the sky is just about every day but when a drought came
[1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:37.480]  in here to site pressure center no no chemtrails well here's what we know
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:45.240]  john what we know is that there is weather modification going on the
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:48.800]  government admits they have those programs but the details are classified
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:52.520]  that's part of the problem having a secret government it not only breeds
[1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:58.040]  corruption and misappropriation of funds and people getting on power trips i mean
[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:03.600]  duh such common sense but well it just allows these people to engage in all
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:09.160]  sorts of bizarre activity and then we just have to wonder what's going on any
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:14.280]  other points you like to make no just to the fact that since the last couple
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:18.920]  years when we've had all this weather the the record tornadoes the record floods
[1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:22.840]  the record everything i mean the destruction has been so bad i mean the
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:25.680]  chinese could have sent a fleet of bombers over here and it couldn't have
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:29.880]  did any less damage of what's been done and but all this stuff is record
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:33.440]  saying the new people get on there say oh we never seen this many tornadoes in
[1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:38.560]  one night we never seen floods like this before but that's not true it's not true
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:44.520]  john i know they say that they've never recorded this many tornadoes because
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:50.320]  they never had Doppler everywhere to pick up every tornado that took place they
[1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:54.040]  say it's the worst drought ever but actually the one in the 50s was even
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:57.840]  worse than what's happening now what they do is they hype it you know they say
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:02.080]  that it's not normal to have hurricanes hit new york i look that up they say
[1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:05.800]  that the water levels rising turns out it's dropping they've now had to admit
[1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:09.800]  that i'm not saying you're wrong you're right that they're saying it's record
[1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:13.360]  setting and if it continues for another year it will be the worst drought
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:17.360]  recorded in modern history here in this area but what do you think the dust
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:21.360]  bowl did i mean that that caused millions of people to have to move out of
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:26.480]  the midwest seven million died from malnutrition associated with it that's
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:31.920]  a major university study seven million died from something similar to what
[1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:37.880]  we're seeing high winds no rain i appreciate your call when was the dust
[1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:44.640]  bowl that was in the 20s in fact look at the point seven million died in great
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:50.640]  depression or seven million died from dust bowl i understand that you're
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:54.160]  saying it's record setting so the government must be doing it and they
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:59.640]  may be but just like government claims they can protect you from everything
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:04.760]  they can't protect you they never have protected people it's our responsibility
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:08.640]  protect ourselves but but we can't even protect ourselves from an act of god a
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:12.680]  tornado a hurricane you can make reasonable preparations you can have a
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:17.520]  storm cellar why do you think everybody had a storm cellar in the old days now
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:23.760]  we just go off the news and hope it protects us there are not more tornadoes
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:28.600]  ladies and gentlemen there have always been tornadoes up and down tornado alley
[1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:34.280]  there have always been tornadoes in new york i saw the news two weeks ago say
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:37.680]  we've never had tornadoes it's global warming i went and looked it up they've
[1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:42.120]  had they've had tornado after tornado a lot of times on the east coast they'd
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:47.320]  call them a black squall a tornado coming in out of the ocean what do you
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:52.120]  think a squall does you know there's the dust bowl
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:58.720]  blow that up for me please the dust bowl or the dirty 30s now they have a
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:02.200]  little one in the 20s too was a period of severe dust storms causing major
[1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:06.840]  ecological agriculture damage to american and canadian prairie lands from
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:13.320]  1930 to 36 in some areas until 1940 the phenomenon what do you think merrill
[1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:17.280]  haggard moved to california was a little kid born in a boxcar traveling there
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:25.400]  was i'm an okie from a skokie was caused by severe drought coupled with
[1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:30.640]  decades of extensive farming without crop rotation yep fallow fields cover
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:36.840]  crops or other techniques prevent wind erosion texas 150 years ago they
[1:15:36.840 --> 1:15:42.160]  reported six seven foot tall grass giant flowers everywhere the cows were like in
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:49.840]  heaven but the cows and the sheep ate it down to the ground and then in the top
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:55.200]  soil ran off now it looks like the surface of a volcanic moon okay let's go
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:16:00.160]  ahead and take another call here let's go ahead and talk to janis in texas
[1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:06.200]  you're on the air welcome hi alex and everyone is complaining that there are
[1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:11.520]  no aerial shots of the overall fire perimeters but i just saw on kv news
[1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:16.040]  that rick perry's like flying all around with a camera and cameras on him
[1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:23.520]  filming no our supreme leader is airborne and he is saving us and and don't
[1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:28.800]  worry though even more powerful fema is here now taking over everything and so
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:32.240]  we're what why is rick perry not demanding that our state guard be
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:38.160]  returned well they've got to grow opium can you give any info on the letting the
[1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:43.240]  fires burn like the fire and bass drop and and also the fire in northeast
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:48.560]  haste county which is the one threatening us it's the containment level
[1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:52.480]  numbers just keep switching and switching and switching it's 40 it's 45 and
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:56.760]  it's 80 and now it's back down to 40 yeah they were saying last time i checked
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:17:02.880]  the what the bass drops 90% uncontained i just heard it was a hundred percent
[1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:07.960]  uncontained yeah well again i heard 90 and then i've heard point is a 90% fire
[1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:14.400]  uncontained is is 100% uncontained when a fires 40% uncontained it's
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:20.960]  uncontained and and again you've got fast driving winds tender box everywhere
[1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:26.320]  it is it is incredible because this is not out west in Wyoming or Montana or
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:30.960]  something then you know where there's a town every 200 miles this is the middle
[1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:40.000]  of little towns and people in big cities everywhere and i've actually got a
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.600]  fellow talk show host who i can't even get on the air because he's busy trying
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:48.800]  to protect his house right now who lives here in austin texas as a frequent
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:51.560]  guest for this show ballish leave it at that we'll definitely get a report from
[1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:56.960]  him later i mean it's serious folks i have watched helicopters two three miles
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:03.160]  away dropping water and big huge yellow planes with props on them dumping
[1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:09.200]  chemicals on fires from my house it took me an hour to get into work today
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:13.160]  normally takes 30 minutes because of just emergency vehicles everywhere and
[1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:18.920]  and again i would drive by and see 30 fire trucks lined up sitting there with
[1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:22.840]  news crews and i don't know what they're doing well i know what they're doing
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:25.720]  they're waiting for femen to come give them orders and rick parody of the
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:28.800]  mortars it's just incredible they ought to just attack it they ought to have
[1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:33.600]  bulldozed look if the if the National Guard was here it'd be bulldozer time
[1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:38.200]  and they would have big bulldozers in there picking fire lines the wind which
[1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:42.880]  way it's going they'd be bulldozing that stuff in they'd be cutting it they'd be
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:48.080]  doing control burns right now that's the only way to stop this got a 20 mile it
[1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:52.000]  fact it's bigger than that now i was just watching the news a 25 mile fire
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:58.480]  that's directly behind me east of me right here it's just like Armageddon and
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:07.600]  all right anything else janice just one last thing my family are all firemen my
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:11.880]  uncle was an arson investigator etc so i know you know the thing to do is to get
[1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:16.120]  out and spray your roof and i was spraying around the house and just got
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:20.400]  accosted by neighbors yelling at me that i was taking away the the water for the
[1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:26.840]  fire see happened to you listen i have a water well and i've talked to neighbors
[1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:30.960]  who've been ninnied at for watering their yard i think people stop when they
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:35.200]  see sprinklers going on my yard from the road they live in the country but up on
[1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:38.320]  the road and try to tell me what to do it's happened to my other neighbors i've

[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:51.920]  every two weeks and again it's this total nitty tattletale society as the
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:56.840]  big mega corporations that are selling central Texas water out just want to
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:25:03.720]  train you to sell you less water for more the aquifers are full down behind my

[1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:13.680]  and it's got fish all in it and it's got a couple feet of spring water in it
[1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:17.800]  that's how much water there is right under the surface and the public is so
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:23.200]  disconnected from reality that they're training everybody don't water save water
[1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:29.800]  I've got a 500 foot deep well that's not deep at all it never runs out you just
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:33.680]  keep you can keep going thousands of feet you heard that poor woman she's got
[1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:37.560]  the fire near her she's out there watering her yard watering to get down to
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:41.880]  keep the house wet oh it's gonna be a lot better if the fire comes and burns
[1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:45.000]  the whole neighborhood down and they've got to use hundreds of thousands of
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.440]  gallons to put it down or should you use a few hundred gallons and keep the fire
[1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:53.960]  from taking place that's how stupid stupid and people don't know a lot of
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:59.160]  them where electricity comes from or where meat comes from in packages they
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:03.840]  know nothing but all over the news they're like do not water we don't have
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:06.480]  enough water the drought the drought the drought and I went and looked at the
[1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:12.000]  actual facts imagine that ladies and gentlemen you don't want your house to
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:17.360]  burn down and a neighbor runs over and says don't water your yard if you a good
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:22.000]  friend of the show and I'm not gonna get into it until we know details but is in
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:26.800]  an area that's being evacuated and I know told us he's there battling to keep
[1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:31.800]  his home from burning down and I know others this is happening to neighbors
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:36.120]  come over and say you do not trim they have rules and awesome you don't cut
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:39.320]  trees without permission you've got to ask the government you do not cut that
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:43.360]  dead tree you do not trim back that brush and you do not water you let the
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:47.600]  house burn down because you don't have lemonade stands you don't have garage
[1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:55.280]  sales you don't have gardens in your yard what a prisoners in a prison allowed
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:01.160]  to do that you are a prisoner of the New World Order by the way Utah legalizes
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:05.800]  gold silver coins as currency no I'm what's happening to Mr. Notehouse though
[1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:10.760]  he's a terrorist the Justice Department says just like those evil terrorists at
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:16.920]  Gibson who were told leave America you can't make this stuff up Sarah in Wyoming
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:23.840]  and EMT fire you're on the air what's your view on what's happening I actually
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:27.360]  wanted to elaborate on one of your points about the dried timber standing
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:32.000]  everywhere in in addition to the record number of the trees they also have another
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.640]  problem called beetle kill and everyone likes to say oh the only way the beetle
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:41.960]  kill will die is if we have our normal winter but global warming is preventing
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:46.840]  all that from dying that's not true beetle kill is naturally eradicated by
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:52.480]  fire and your normal fire will burn through an area take out all the dead
[1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:57.160]  take out all the underbrush and leave the living trees behind but now that we've
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:00.960]  been putting out all these fires and not letting people cut any trees or
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:05.840]  anything like that relieving all this dry tender standing and it kills off
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:09.480]  absolutely everything so you have an entire forest wiped out when it shouldn't
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:13.520]  be that way that's right even here in Austin you'll see in the piney woods and
[1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:17.760]  other areas where the trees that are green have sap in them so they don't
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:23.760]  burn and only the underbrush is burning and so it cleans things out puts the
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:28.080]  nitrogen and other things back into the soil and then it comes back you know
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:33.160]  much more healthy afterwards but all over the country they don't allow that
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:36.880]  stuff to be cut out or hauled away so it's burning so hot it's killing the
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:41.960]  living trees as well. Wyoming actually just moved from southern California which
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:46.680]  is notorious for fires both California and Wyoming have the beetle kill
[1:28:46.680 --> 1:28:51.480]  problem here you can buy a permit for ten bucks and go cut yourself a quarter
[1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:56.040]  wood and each family can have up to ten cords and it's just dry seasoned standing
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:29:00.840]  in California you can't cut it you can't touch it you can't technically you're
[1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:05.040]  not even supposed to be able to go off legal state-run trails or federal run
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:08.160]  trails or campgrounds. Now let's think about that and I also have read in
[1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:12.500]  California now they're starting it in Texas they have these in viral cops that
[1:29:12.500 --> 1:29:16.000]  pull you over and even if you paid for the water it's off your own land they
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:22.680]  demand to see the permit and now again dead timber everywhere standing up
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:27.440]  laying down you can't trim it and then when there's a fire it creates a deadly
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:32.680]  inferno. Now catch me California a plane crashed in the forest and you've got
[1:29:32.680 --> 1:29:36.480]  13,000 acre to burn this place hasn't burned in hundreds of years and now
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:40.160]  you're gonna see a whole city wiped out if the winds change. It's the post
[1:29:40.160 --> 1:29:44.840]  industrial world you cannot let slaves do anything don't cut wood don't have
[1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:49.000]  lemonade stands you're a prisoner in a super max we'll be right back stay with

[1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:09.520]  supply. Folks there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think
[1:32:09.520 --> 1:32:13.360]  it's important for my listeners to do three things right away. Number one,
[1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:19.440]  study the past. History really does repeat itself. Number two, learn to spot the
[1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:26.000]  dangerous food shortage trends. Number three, take decisive action. A perfect
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  storm is brewing or a global food crisis. That's why I'm telling everyone to
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:36.200]  read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:41.160]  deadliest famines in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.

[1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:40.880]  Taliban being U.S. government funded, TSA abuses, different police state

[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:11.040]  which that are two hours long. We've been doing tape special reports mixed in
[1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:18.400]  with live. I've been doing the new rants that are on the rant page that are

[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:44.960]  continue to build this true alternative media organization. We are the real
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:52.880]  media and we are exposing the hoax that is the mainstream dinosaur system but
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:58.400]  it's important that we expand that we hire more reporters that we be able to
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:03.040]  condense the information down for the general public and yes it's in beta test
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:06.480]  right now though a lot of folks do love the new show for prisonplanet.tv
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:11.560]  members I have had some networks and cable systems including international
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:16.000]  systems that have already wanted us to do shows I've already wanted us to edit
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:21.440]  the daily radio TV show into an hour program in the last year or so and I've
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:24.680]  just said no because we weren't ready for that but we're also getting ready for
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:28.560]  that move where it will be available on some different cable and satellite
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:33.680]  systems but for everybody the one place to get it will be prisonplanet.tv so
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:38.280]  this is a venture that's reaching tens of millions of new people in the aggregate
[1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:44.400]  my radio show my news websites just our YouTube page alone has reached about 135
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:48.160]  million people you count the other YouTube pages over 300 million in just
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:52.320]  the last three years that's just one little area is our YouTube hundreds of
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:55.840]  millions so that's why we've got to go to the next level and really instead of
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:59.200]  just putting out a couple documentaries a year or doing a few special reports
[1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:04.200]  here and there actually have a disciplined nightly show where we just
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:08.760]  I'd say this is gonna reach twice as many people as everything else we've done
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:13.720]  in the next year and it is it just reaches them in so much more of a focused
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:17.680]  professional way because it makes me stay focused and stay within those
[1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:21.560]  limited time parameters people don't have enough time to listen to a whole
[1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:26.680]  three-hour show but they can watch a 30-minute news show so again prison
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:30.680]  planet.tv we've had a lot of new people join I want to welcome all those new
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:33.720]  members I want you to send us your emails your feedback we're adding new
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:38.280]  features tweaking things adding more versions I know we upload it well it
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:42.080]  goes live every night and streams and restreams several times then you have
[1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:45.560]  the archive but it's in real high-def takes a lot of folks a long time to
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:49.520]  download that so we're gonna add some lower res versions here in the next
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:53.840]  week we're working as hard as we can for you we appreciate all of your support

[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:22.000]  that are really making the difference out there because the mainstream media as
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:27.320]  you well know I call them the prostitutes and the ABC's the CVS is the
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:34.000]  NBC's the NPR's the PBS is the BBC's are nothing more than houses of
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:40.840]  prostitution and what they're doing as any prostitute does is just serving
[1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:47.520]  their masters and at this critical time at this critical time they're just
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:53.800]  silent on this economic collapse and they're making it sound as though you
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:58.720]  know just hold your breath this is a good buying opportunity the policy makers
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:02.560]  are going to come up with solutions they just have to put their heads together
[1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:07.400]  you know and and they're not going to come up with anything because it's an
[1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:13.120]  unsolvable situation and as we look at what's going on in the news today
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:18.440]  encourage events forming future trends it's important to understand what just
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:22.840]  happened in Switzerland overnight that most people probably don't know about
[1:41:22.840 --> 1:41:27.640]  about a year and a half ago in the trends journal I make it very clear what my
[1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:33.240]  investment strategies are I don't give advice I just say what I do I said that
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:39.680]  I was buying heavily into Swiss francs and gold well about three weeks ago I
[1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:44.120]  made it public again that I was out of Swiss francs because they were
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:49.000]  announcing a scheme to peg this the Swiss franc to the euro you said that
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:54.280]  here and I said it on your on air with you as well and they did it last night
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:42:01.000]  and they did it for one reason and it's the same reason they do everything to
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:08.440]  help the bigs to help the Nestle's to help the the ABBs to help the Huffman
[1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:16.040]  Laroches to help them sell more of their crap to countries overseas whereby they
[1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:20.320]  have to make their currency less expensive so they could spend more of
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:25.320]  their so more of their product as they screw the Swiss people because now
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:30.480]  everything is going to cause them more so no longer are as I used to call the
[1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:36.840]  Swiss the money cockroaches of the world now they're just the number of other
[1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:43.000]  rats out there who are the in what they call the banking system that is selling
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:48.760]  the people out and that's what they're doing they're selling us out as we speak
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:55.320]  whether it's the Swiss doing it as you mentioned a new name for QE to the ship
[1:42:55.320 --> 1:43:01.000]  is going under but I want to go back to the prostitutes and why it's important
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:07.480]  for everyone out there to tell all their friends to keep getting people tuning
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:14.160]  into you because here's what they do Alex remember Hurricane Irene and you saw
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:20.960]  all these prostitutes geared up in their hurricane gear closing down New York City
[1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:26.800]  putting fear in hysteria in the hearts of everyone listen to what your mayor
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:33.320]  says stay inside you know they should change the name of that show Anderson
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:43.600]  Cooper 360 to AC DC 180 because that guy was screaming like crazy out there the
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:50.840]  point I'm making whether it's a hurricane disaster whether it's terrorism boy
[1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:57.960]  did they hit you with fear in hysteria but not when the economy is collapsing
[1:43:57.960 --> 1:44:04.960]  not when the whole world markets are unraveling as they did yesterday while
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:11.920]  Americans who had jobs celebrated Labor Day the European markets and the Asian
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:19.360]  markets but they lost on average European 5% Asian 2.5% it continues as I speak
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:25.640]  they're not saying head for the hills batten down the hatches make sure you
[1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:31.360]  have security measures and oh no no pick up the turlet paper a record the New
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:37.400]  York Times this guy Ron Lieber wrote a story a few weeks ago you know don't do
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:44.520]  anything don't use that fear and flight and fear and flight mentality just stay
[1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:50.320]  put don't run away from home don't put your money into gold just listen to us
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:56.880]  so what they do is they scare the hell out of people to control them with fear
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:03.400]  and hysteria but when it comes to losing your money they tell you take a deep
[1:45:03.400 --> 1:45:10.120]  breath it's just a hiccup it's a buying opportunity well that was my they're
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:16.720]  raping you in front of your eyes Gerald I want to specifically get your take on
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:21.520]  the Wall Street Journal a week and a half ago ran with a report even Goldman
[1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:28.760]  Sachs secretly believes that an economic collapse is coming and quietly to the
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:33.880]  big players and big institutional investors like universities and billionaires
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:39.920]  they told them hey we're betting on in a 50 page 54 page report and basically a
[1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:45.200]  total collapse in the next three to six months Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are
[1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:50.880]  also betting on $2,500 an ounce gold by the end of 2011 just a few months away
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:54.840]  but then meanwhile their pundits I see them on the news and see them on
[1:45:54.840 --> 1:46:00.400]  Bloomberg making fun of anyone talking about a collapse so basically they're
[1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:05.560]  trying to pump it up to keep all the little guys in while they get out the
[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:11.080]  back door and again they engineer the crisis and get more power out of it
[1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:15.720]  that's the method of the madness and as they wreck economies they then always
[1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:20.440]  poses the saviors but but this is all coming to an end Congress record low
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:23.640]  approval rating record number of Americans think the government is
[1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:28.800]  working against them and is not in their best interest we have all this stuff
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:32.640]  happening everything you talked about is coming true what Ron Paul talked about
[1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:37.960]  all coming true what I talked about common sense history hey they're devaluing
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:41.840]  the currency hey they're selling trillions in fake derivatives hey they're
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:45.840]  too big to fail they're going to feed everything into their system hey every
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:49.360]  bailout in Europe is led by a new bailout I mean we know where this is
[1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:54.160]  headed so so why does the system think they can get away with this or is there
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:59.400]  a type of collective delusion going on I mean I mean you've worked in and around
[1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:03.560]  these people as a big consultant and in government and as a lobbyist really
[1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:07.120]  knowing these people you know I understand they've got a plan they think
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:11.600]  they're in control but at the same time more and more I agree with what I've
[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:15.120]  heard you and others say that they're not really in control and that's almost
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:19.560]  even more scary so Gerald Salenta your view on the fact that they're secretly
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:24.400]  betting against their own system and and sending out to their low-level clients
[1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:29.640]  just like Timberwolf said ways to sucker them I mean these are degenerate
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:34.440]  nastiest criminals you can imagine well they're money junkies just like a
[1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:40.760]  heroin addict a coke addict a mess addict they're money addicts you know
[1:47:40.760 --> 1:47:44.560]  that's what they do they have no bounds and boundaries you know they'll kill
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:50.560]  their mother to make a buck and they show that they will let's understand
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:57.120]  Alex that most of the people again are lulled into you know meeting the
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:48:03.600]  prostitutes on Sunday morning they're not watching you they're the only the
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:08.160]  small minority you know we're looking at about a 20% of the population that
[1:48:08.160 --> 1:48:13.320]  gets it at any level look at the wimpy crats those screaming liberals those
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:19.400]  key-sheeters and with the balsamic smiles look what Obama did to them on the day
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:25.560]  before Labor Day when no one's watching the news he announced that well we're
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:29.940]  gonna do but I'm not gonna pass those pollution the pieces of pollution
[1:48:29.940 --> 1:48:36.160]  legislation smog legislation because it might hurt businesses so they know
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:41.880]  what they're doing and all they're interested in doing is protecting the
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:48.680]  two bigs you look at luxury sales they're doing fine because all the money is
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:55.600]  going to the top of the pyramid so they know that all they have to do whether
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:03.200]  it's false leg or real and I've seen it in some of you once that happens they
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:11.440]  use the fear and hysteria card terrorism you know an attack somewhere
[1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:18.200]  whatever it might be to get the sheeple back in line and that's what's going to
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:23.960]  happen mark my words before the elections of 2012 happens fear and
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:29.320]  hysteria at some level will be running through this country well going back to
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:32.840]  what you were talking about earlier it's it's central to all of this they hype up
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:35.960]  and fear monger things that aren't really dangerous or that we have no
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:41.960]  control over while ignoring the total end of our financial system a bottomless
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:47.480]  black hole of depression which they've engineered and then you were talking
[1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:53.280]  about alternative media's rise Janet Napolitano has come out and attacked
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:50:01.240]  drudge report for you know calling her basically a monster and and and she's
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:05.160]  attacked the alternative media saying that they haven't lied about the naked
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:09.640]  body scanners as she says that Janet Napolitano drudge is just wrong on
[1:50:09.640 --> 1:50:14.840]  privacy they're having to respond now to the internet because if you look at the
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:18.840]  numbers the alternative media dwarfs mainstream media the mainstream media is
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:23.440]  not mainstream anymore I know they're not but they still have a very powerful
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:28.760]  voice and that's when people tune in in times of crisis and that's why they'll
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:33.640]  get the sheeple to follow them and you mentioned about the Goldman Sachs report
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:39.080]  listen to what the head of the Deutsche Bank Ackerman said yesterday he
[1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:45.360]  compared what's going on now to 2008 the financial panic yeah no kidding you've
[1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:49.560]  got to wait for him to tell you but but but we stay there we got to go to break
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:53.760]  but we told everybody then it'll be a couple more years if this will cause
[1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:58.520]  inflation will be in a worse depression at the end of it we'll be right back

[1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:57.520]  anybody believe them look at the spectacle that happened this past summer
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:04.160]  with the debt ceiling issue it was the DC drama Queens the Democrats against the
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:11.360]  Beltway circle jerks the Republicans how could any respectable person look to a
[1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:18.560]  politician like them and and have think that they know more than they do again
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:24.080]  as I've said over and over again these politicians are no more than the people
[1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:29.200]  you hated in high school and college that wanted to become class president and
[1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:34.440]  head of the student council that's all this is it's Harvard Princeton Yale
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:39.200]  bullets bombs and banks and you were talking before about the Goldman Sachs
[1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:45.040]  gang and the report that came out this is one big Ponzi scheme they are
[1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:52.320]  suckering in the little people am I saying that no that came from the king
[1:56:52.320 --> 1:57:01.400]  of Ponzi Bernie Madoff February 27 New York magazine a telephone interview he
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:06.520]  said he learned two things when he got into the stock market business number
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:15.160]  one the game is rigged and number two it's all a big Ponzi scheme that's all
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:22.360]  this is and by the way gold prices today hit what one thousand nine hundred and
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:27.680]  twenty two dollars and now they fall in about sixty bucks you're going to see
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:34.880]  wild swings in the markets the higher the price goes the greater the swing and
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:41.280]  I have to tell you my greatest concern I believe that they're going to do
[1:57:41.280 --> 1:57:47.960]  something try something to regulate the supply and sale of gold because they're
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:53.360]  going to blame people like myself and others who have been buying gold for
[1:57:53.360 --> 1:57:59.400]  years as a safe haven against the digital money that's not worth the paper it's
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:08.760]  not printed on as being responsible for this crisis just as the Wall Street
[1:58:08.760 --> 1:58:18.640]  Barker's and Money Honey Chilets are out there blaming socialism on the
[1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:26.280]  problems in Europe I hear it every day no it's not the Society General Gang or
[1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:32.680]  the Deutsche Bank bandits or the Credit Suisse credit no they're even starting
[1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:37.560]  to try to blame Ron Paul do five more minutes with us Gerald we'll be right

[2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:12.600]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:20.120]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:23.760]  Alex Jones.
[2:00:27.040 --> 2:00:31.320]  Wow the first two hours went really quick hard to believe we're already in an hour.
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:34.560]  Number three Max Kaiser coming in about 30 minutes. I want to get to more of your
[2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:38.520]  calls for those that are patiently holding talking about the wildfires. The
[2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:42.800]  fact that Rick Perry and FEMA can't save you won't save you. A bunch of other
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:46.240]  economic news. I've got a whole smattering of key things I want to get
[2:00:46.240 --> 2:00:50.880]  into but Gerald I think you've hit on the heart of it here. If you see the
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:54.520]  internal Homeland Security training manuals going back at least three years
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:01:00.000]  it's gun owners, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, organic
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.960]  gardeners, anybody who wants to be self-sufficient, anybody who's been
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:10.320]  warning about what we see historically unfolding. We're now the bad guys and I
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:14.880]  do actually see and I guess that's why you're now making this prediction or
[2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:19.400]  concur with me that you've been seeing it. They're more and more saying well
[2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:23.440]  Ron Paul stands to gain for everything falling apart you know and it's his
[2:01:23.440 --> 2:01:27.080]  talk causing this and I get emails saying you know you're the reason the
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:31.240]  markets are going down. No it's not Jamie Diamond and Blank Find and Paul
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:34.440] son and all these guys it's not the trillions and derivatives and the
[2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:37.840]  trillions they've gotten in their hundred billion dollar bonuses. No it's
[2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:43.040]  our fault Gerald so we've gone from pessimist porn and people that are
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:48.040]  just crazy to now telling people there was an iceberg it's our fault we're
[2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:51.880]  hitting an iceberg. I don't see that working though. I mean you already have
[2:01:51.880 --> 2:01:55.720]  the fellow reserve wildly unpopular, the people are already very angry at the
[2:01:55.720 --> 2:01:59.000]  banksters, I don't see it working. What are you in the last four minutes we've
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:04.680]  got? So top trends researcher out there where do you see this going now? It's
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:07.560]  clear they're not going to reverse any of the policies. We're going over the
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:12.800]  edge so what's the time frame? I've never seen a summer like the one we just went
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:19.240]  through with the volatility in the markets, the rise of gold so rapidly. This
[2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:25.760]  usually doesn't happen in the summertime. It happened actually to a bit in 2007
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:30.480]  and that's what actually was one of the reasons why I had predicted the panic of
[2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:37.320]  08 in the summer of 2007. What happens now is that everyone's off their holiday
[2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:42.760]  particularly in Europe. Reality's setting in, third-quarter reports are coming in
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:48.640]  so look for the real crash become a winter of discontent. Markets tend to
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:53.840]  really dive in October. Remember they're going to do everything they can. We know
[2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:59.520]  it's a rigged game to keep propping it up but I believe that by one October, the
[2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:05.200]  end of October, early November at the latest, the handwriting will be on the
[2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:11.240]  wall. We didn't go into a double-dip recession. It will now begin to
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:18.400]  say depression but again there's so many wild cards and the wild card to look at
[2:03:18.400 --> 2:03:24.080]  is the wild card of distraction and that's going to come in the form I
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:31.480]  believe of something that they will labor terror or war, some other fear in
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:38.480]  hysteria kind of moment to detract the people's attention away from the
[2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:47.880]  economic crisis. I have to agree with you so all of the craziness we've seen
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:52.920]  you're basically saying is just a prelude or like birthing pains to the
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:57.480]  real finale and what is this system going to give birth to? Just an absolute
[2:03:57.480 --> 2:04:03.240]  collapse? Yeah it's collapsing. You're going to start seeing more and more.
[2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:06.880]  Look at the numbers. The gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in the
[2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:13.200]  U.S. than any of the industrialized nations. 47 shootings in New York this
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:16.840]  past weekend. Oh no, there was just some other big shootings. I was going to bring
[2:04:16.840 --> 2:04:23.600]  that up. A building just got shot up an H&R block. People are just getting
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:28.520]  desperate and going crazy. Exactly and it's happening worldwide by the way. This
[2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:33.600]  isn't just a U.S. phenomenon but look what they're doing in the UK. Look how
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:38.040]  they're cracking down. You know what Gerald? They're going to do everywhere and that's what
[2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:43.080]  we're trying to say Alex is that the worse it gets the harder they're going
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:48.400]  to crack down on us and they'll blame you know the looters and the
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:54.160]  hooligans and none of the economic issues. The sheeple will all clap their hands
[2:04:54.160 --> 2:04:57.800]  and look for protection. Trends research. They're going to do what they did in Europe.
[2:04:57.800 --> 2:05:03.720]  Trendsresearch.com Gerald Salente. A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in
[2:05:03.720 --> 2:05:09.120]  2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years. He
[2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:13.040]  says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest,
[2:05:13.040 --> 2:05:16.360]  educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own
[2:05:16.360 --> 2:05:19.720]  family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[2:05:19.720 --> 2:05:24.480]  The crazy part is he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse of GM,
[2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:27.800]  Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner General Growth
[2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:32.960]  Properties. In fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently he created
[2:05:32.960 --> 2:05:36.400]  a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:40.240]  important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:43.880]  enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains
[2:05:43.880 --> 2:05:47.040]  everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect
[2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:53.200]  yourself. You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America.

[2:06:03.320 --> 2:06:06.880]  years with Steve Shank and E-Foods Direct. I have E-Foods for my own
[2:06:06.880 --> 2:06:10.640]  emergency food supply. You know Steve, life is different now for all of us,
[2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:14.320]  isn't it? Very different. People are using this great food to survive the
[2:06:14.320 --> 2:06:18.560]  present hurricane season and we've already had 40 billion dollars worth of
[2:06:18.560 --> 2:06:23.160]  damage from floods, storms, quakes and droughts and that's just the first eight
[2:06:23.160 --> 2:06:27.480]  months of this year. Natural disasters are newsworthy but only touch a few of us
[2:06:27.480 --> 2:06:32.080]  Americans. The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind. The
[2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:36.400]  unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs
[2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:41.160]  are hitting every American so everyone needs food security. Folks this month you
[2:06:41.160 --> 2:06:44.520]  will get free shipping on every food order from E-Foods Direct. That's right,

[2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:06.080]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is
[2:07:06.080 --> 2:07:11.400]  our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda that
[2:07:11.400 --> 2:07:14.960]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've determined
[2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:19.600]  its influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[2:07:19.600 --> 2:07:24.720]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[2:07:24.720 --> 2:07:28.760]  attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The
[2:07:28.760 --> 2:07:33.920]  criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:37.520]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:07:37.520 --> 2:07:41.120]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[2:07:41.120 --> 2:07:46.360]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:52.040]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:31.160]  Radio Network.
[2:08:31.160 --> 2:08:35.160]  Okay ladies and gentlemen we're gonna go back to your calls now ahead of Max
[2:08:35.160 --> 2:08:39.240]  Kaiser on the total meltdowns in the European stock market. The wild
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:44.960]  gyrations in the US stock market full update on all of that. Unfortunately
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:49.360]  everything we predicted is coming true not because we're smart. The globalist
[2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:54.480]  have planned all of this out. By the way that was too powerful of an interview
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:08:59.720]  with Gerald Salente and if you missed the last segment he started getting into
[2:08:59.720 --> 2:09:04.680]  the collapse of society, the police state, the violence that's coming, the
[2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:10.000]  breakdown, the road warrior scenario. He's gonna join us tonight on info wars
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:14.320]  nightly news. After the markets have closed we'll be able to really break down
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:19.160]  the aftermath of this 7 p.m. tonight. Paul Joseph Watson also on a host of
[2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:23.800]  issues. I'll be joining us from England. We're working on some guests here in
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:28.040]  town who've been battling fires themselves. That's right you want to save
[2:09:28.040 --> 2:09:33.920]  your house so you're not gonna get government help. I drove by Steiner
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:37.080]  Ranch this morning. I wanted to go up there and see what was going on and I
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:42.480]  saw a parking lot with probably 30 fire trucks. Some of them a little but most
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:48.480]  of them big and news vans. I mean what are they doing? What are they doing? They
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:54.120]  should be in there doing controlled burns with bulldozers blocking these fires. It
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:58.960]  is just a limp-rested response with a limp-rested governor flying around
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:05.860]  dreaming of Al Gore in the sky above us. All of that's going on. Ron Paul has come
[2:10:05.860 --> 2:10:11.080]  out and said that indeed Rick Perry is a cheerleader, an effeminate cheerleader,
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:17.280]  male cheerleader. It's what he is for Al Gore. Well that's the headline on the
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:21.000]  article Steve Watson has about it. So we'll play that clip of the new Ron Paul
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:26.600]  ad getting on the attack. Oh by the way I forgot they've got a scientific gallop
[2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:32.960]  poll out in Iowa. Ron Paul is only four points behind two guys. He's about four
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:37.920]  points behind each one of them. Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, both the Clark Kent,
[2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:42.360]  Kendall types. And if you're going for Kendall's folks just go jump off the edge
[2:10:42.360 --> 2:10:45.520]  of a cliff, okay? We've had enough cheerleaders and effeminate Kendall's,
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:50.040]  okay? I understand you don't like old states but actually are smart. I
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:53.560]  understand you go for looks here. But I mean Rick Perry looks like he's been
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:58.960]  run over by a 5,000 pound armadillo. But the point is if you vote for the carbon
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:02.840]  taxing, world government loving Kendall's, you get what you deserve. But
[2:11:02.840 --> 2:11:07.440]  finally Ron Paul, it's in my stack here. You can pull it up. It's on infowars.com
[2:11:07.440 --> 2:11:13.560]  and prisonplotter.com. Ron Paul is only four points in a gallop poll. Four
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:21.400]  stinking points behind Mitt Romney and Ricky Perry. Four points with the media,
[2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:26.600]  the establishment, dying media, flopping around, flailing around like a dying, dying
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:33.040]  maggot, an 8,000 pound maggot, telling everyone that he can't win. He is gaining.
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:37.600]  He's been in the top three. He's won straw polls in New Hampshire in other areas,
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:42.480]  statistical tie, even though Bachman bought hers. And I mean, Bachman is better
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:45.760]  than Rick Perry. I mean, don't get me wrong. Even though she was an IRS attack
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:11:50.200]  dog enforcer, she spends that that she was wanted to learn the enemy's
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:54.720]  operations. And I went, wait a minute, that is actually one of the best pieces of
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:11:58.880]  baloney I've ever heard. Or it's true because a lot of the top lawyers that
[2:11:58.880 --> 2:12:02.240]  fight the IRS did go to work for him first. And if you're going to fight the
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:08.000]  IRS, that's actually what you do. So maybe that's true. I'm not saying Bachman's
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:13.400]  perfect by any means, but Ron Paul likes her a lot better than, you know, he's
[2:12:13.400 --> 2:12:17.320]  friends, whether he likes her, she's not perfect, but she's a lot. Just listen,
[2:12:17.320 --> 2:12:22.520]  you idiots out there that like Rick Perry and the like Mitt Romney, what is wrong
[2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:28.280]  with you? Ron Paul is four points from being number one. He is number three
[2:12:28.280 --> 2:12:33.160]  right now. Bachman's down behind him in every major poll. Ron Paul could be the
[2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:37.440]  next president. Would he fix everything? No. Would it be a big step in the right
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:41.520]  direction? Would it be a big signal that the American flags flying above this
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:46.120]  country again? The globalists wrap all their turning the American flag. They
[2:12:46.120 --> 2:12:50.080]  sell their whole agenda in fake patriotism. Meanwhile, it's back in the news.
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:55.240]  It's now hit AFP, big French news agency and other publications that cancer
[2:12:55.240 --> 2:13:00.120]  among 9 11 workers sparks political storm, that there is a coverup of it, that
[2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:05.400]  they're barred from the September 11th events this year. In America, you can't
[2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:09.480]  have a lemonade stand. First responder heroes aren't allowed at the memorial.
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:19.200]  FEMA runs around blocking people's response to hurricanes and fires. It's a
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:23.520]  twilight zone. Gibson guitar is rated in India says they haven't even broken a law
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:28.240]  and they tell Gibson get out of the country. You got a bunch of crazy people
[2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:33.280]  running things. A bunch of crazy like a Fox control freaks who all over the
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:38.160]  country say, well, we've got giant belts of government land along cities and the
[2:13:38.160 --> 2:13:41.680]  government won't sell the land and no one's allowed to even take the dead
[2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:46.200]  timber out. People are like, but when there's a fire, it's gonna really
[2:13:46.200 --> 2:13:51.240]  devastate things. They go, sorry, that's the way it is. I see news in Austin now
[2:13:51.240 --> 2:13:54.040]  where they don't even let you cut your own trees and they're they're finding
[2:13:54.040 --> 2:14:02.920]  people and arresting people. Incredible. Aaron in Texas while fire info. Aaron,
[2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:08.760]  what's on your mind today? Oh, thank you. Um, okay. There's the, uh, stone oak fire
[2:14:08.760 --> 2:14:15.080]  out in San Antonio. Um, evidently it was actually started by, uh, a city vehicle,
[2:14:15.080 --> 2:14:20.280]  uh, sanitation vehicle was, uh, working on something. And, uh, so the people are
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:24.800]  all outraged. They're asking them to pay for it and then looking in the comments
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:29.920]  on the story, which is very good. Um, it seems like, uh, one person has commented.
[2:14:29.920 --> 2:14:34.880]  Uh, I live a stone's throw from stone oak. We recently received a notice from
[2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:39.680]  saw, that's the sewer district, that they were going to be testing for leaks in
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:45.280]  our sewer systems and be, and would be using a smoke generator to do so. So, uh,
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:50.240]  they may be, uh, covering the story with that. The truck got stuck in a ditch
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:54.640]  and overheated and that sparked the fire, uh, as a way of, you know, covering
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:57.520]  their negligence type of thing. Well, that's how a lot of these fires are
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:02.240]  starting as cars break down. You, you go off the road, grass touches the bottom
[2:15:02.240 --> 2:15:07.120]  and there's high wind blowing and a fire starts right there. Look, if, if, if
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:10.640]  government has to pay for burning the houses down, we pay for it. I mean,
[2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:14.240]  you know, there's such a thing as an act of God and the homeless have been
[2:15:14.240 --> 2:15:17.760]  starting some of the fires in town, trying to cook their food. I mean, it's
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:22.960]  dangerous. Uh, it's, it's desert conditions, 20% humidity, no rain for
[2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:27.920]  three or four months in most areas, not enough rain the last, you know, five years.
[2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:31.600]  And it's like a tender box. I'm like living in a fireworks factory.
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:38.160]  Uh, but send us that article to, uh, showtipsandinfowars.com or anything else.
[2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:42.320]  Oh, I just love your broadcast. I really appreciate the work that you're doing
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:50.800]  and, uh, I, uh, want to say that, uh, let's not forget that Biden's, uh,
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:53.040]  hello? Yes. You said Biden. Go ahead.
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:16:00.000]  One top story. I want to say two things. Biden, I got sworn in, uh, swears in, uh,
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.480]  Petraeus, a CIA director today. Yes.
[2:16:02.480 --> 2:16:06.160]  He's vicious. But I want, I want to say something about, uh, Drudge. Drudge is
[2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:09.440]  just an aggregator of the news. He just puts up the headlines. He doesn't write
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:13.600]  the story. So what is her problem? Napolitano, she's just,
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:17.200]  what, complained that he puts up stories that other people write or something?
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:21.760]  Well, no, no, no, no. Listen, more than half the TSA stories that Drudge linked to,
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:26.640]  and last year it was mainly ours. Let's say 90%. Our hardcore reporting,
[2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:30.480]  our catching them in lies. Drudge. I mean, we're big, but nothing compared in the
[2:16:30.480 --> 2:16:35.360]  web world, nothing. I mean, he drives more than Facebook and Twitter combined.
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:40.640]  Even the New York Times admits he is numero uno setting news agendas. They hate it.
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:44.800]  And so this is Napolitano basically attacking info wars.
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:49.840]  And it shows the effect we're having. Just like we openly had the White House come out against us,
[2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:54.000]  we exposed their program to shut down selective power plants. The White House came out and said,
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:58.400]  we were full of baloney. We're really getting to the point now. I mean, it came out two years ago.
[2:16:58.400 --> 2:17:03.760]  I was on the White House enemies list and that doesn't scare me. That's a mark of honor.
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:09.200]  That's a badge of courage that, and that's a badge of courage. That's a trophy that belongs to all
[2:17:09.200 --> 2:17:15.680]  of you. The listeners, we don't have power because of Alex Jones. We have power because of you
[2:17:15.680 --> 2:17:21.120]  spreading the word about the radio broadcast, about info wars.com, about the videos about
[2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:25.280]  prison planet.TV. And now our new offering in the fight for liberty.
[2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:32.160]  The info wars nightly news. God bless you. Good to hear from you. Let's go ahead and talk to Damon
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:38.480]  Damian in South Carolina. Thanks for holding on wildfires. Go ahead. Alex. First of all,
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:42.960]  I want to say, I feel for you. I'm very sorry to hear that you guys are having all those fires
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:48.320]  out there. I own Timber Proper here in South Carolina and I have lots of friends who work in
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:52.880]  the land management. And we've had some serious fires here in the last few years because of
[2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:58.480]  the same problems that you're having. Federal government won't let the land and timber management
[2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:03.520]  people do control burns. Myrtle Beach, I don't know if you remember this last summer and the summer
[2:18:03.520 --> 2:18:10.000]  before and even this year had massive burning that went on out there. Now, you've got to cut
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:14.960]  channels and do control burns in the old days. Neighbors got together and by the way, we've
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:19.040]  now learning in Bastrop that there's a state park out there. That's where a lot of this is
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:24.560]  going on. Turns out the feds don't allow control burns there because they're advising the state.
[2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:31.760]  Turns out it's the same story again. South Carolina had almost as dry as summer as you have
[2:18:31.760 --> 2:18:36.480]  and we've had massive burning in the last two years and this year out in Myrtle Beach area
[2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:41.920]  specifically. But the other point I want to touch on briefly is that Gerald Filente,
[2:18:41.920 --> 2:18:45.360]  it's interesting he mentioned it. I've been on hold for a while to talk to you today.
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:49.760]  Vermont was just completely devastated by the rain from Irene. I don't know if you've seen the
[2:18:49.760 --> 2:18:56.560]  pictures. And their whole industry is tourism and the roads aren't there for tours now.
[2:18:56.560 --> 2:19:03.040]  And for Gerald to say that we're seeing collapse by collapse by collapse. And they sent National
[2:19:03.040 --> 2:19:07.680]  Guard up there. And I don't know if you remember this. Vermont was so proud at 08 that they were
[2:19:07.680 --> 2:19:12.480]  the first state to tally all their votes and they overwhelmingly voted for Obama in the election.
[2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:18.720]  And it's like he's not even going up there. I mean, I don't want them to send FEMA there,
[2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:22.320]  but they're not getting any relief. I mean, certain states are sending stuff up, which is great.
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:29.600]  But the flood insurance, which is controlled by FEMA, everybody's claims are being denied.
[2:19:30.640 --> 2:19:37.040]  That's another great point. They're denying almost all the claims. FEMA makes you buy flood
[2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:41.600]  insurance and in many cases, purchase it through them because others won't insure. Then they deny
[2:19:41.600 --> 2:19:46.640]  it. That's another incredible scandal. It's another tax. And you're absolutely right. Look,
[2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:52.000]  look, I appreciate your call. It's very elementary. States are supposed to have the National Guard
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:57.360]  for emergencies. The feds take that away from us and give us FEMA back,
[2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:22.640]  which are a bunch of worthless criminals. We'll be right back.
[2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:33.840]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers,

[2:24:01.840 --> 2:24:08.560]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network.
[2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:22.560]  Okay, you heard me mentioning that Ron Paul ad. This is the only way Ron Paul's going to win. A,
[2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:29.840]  we expose the hoax that he can't win. We explain to people this is a psychological warfare tactic.
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:36.080]  B, we put up the fact that he's the only person with a no compromise voting record who predicted
[2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:41.520]  the problems we face accurately. C, he's the only guy being demonized and attacked across the
[2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:48.240]  political spectrum because he is an outsider. And of course, D, if we vote for establishment
[2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:53.680]  candidates again, we deserve what we get. But more importantly and lastly,
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:25:03.680]  we have got to go after Mitt Romney and we've got to go after Rick Perry. We have got
[2:25:03.680 --> 2:25:12.960]  to expose them. Their records are unbelievably bad. I mean, these guys may be slick talking and
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:19.280]  there's something about yuppies and establishment people and I watch it. If you get around really
[2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:24.480]  rich people, really successful people, and I've in my days been around a lot of them,
[2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:30.480]  they're nice, they're real on average, but they're also somewhat reclusive. But you get around
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:36.080]  social climber wannabes. I don't care if they're black, white, Hispanic, whatever they are.
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:44.160]  They're like in a make believe land, come of the country club types where they ignore people and
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:50.640]  act all manipulative and sit there and play games. They act like junior high or something.
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:55.840]  And that's why they're all into how they dress and what they drive and having a certain look and
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:04.080]  whatever group, the hippies do it, the motorcycle folks do it, the sports fans do it. I'm not
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:08.720]  saying you're bad if you like motorcycles or sports or hippy stuff. I'm saying within all
[2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:14.000]  those little genres, there's a certain group that latch on to it and say, I'm in this community.
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:22.240]  And these mainline Republicans really think it's all about going for the establishment candidate
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:32.880]  and somehow they win. It's like the know-it-all calling everybody else stupid liberal types
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:39.280]  who defend Barack Obama no matter what. I've noticed online, they are some of the nastiest
[2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:45.040]  people. I mean, they will put out whole cloth incredible lies on their own websites, even
[2:26:45.040 --> 2:26:49.280]  though I could zoom into oblivion, because they believe that they're on a holy mission
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:54.560]  to expose me because I don't like Barack Obama. And you try to point out he's bought and paid
[2:26:54.560 --> 2:27:00.000]  for by big foreign banks. He's continuing the torture of the war. They're like shut up scum.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:04.720]  Okay, but he's funding Al Qaeda. I mean, this is a war in Libya, right? I mean, he is a peace
[2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:10.720]  prize. Shut up, you dirty right-winger racist. And you're like, but being adult, I'm not any of
[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:16.400]  those things. I'm a human being just like you. I want to communicate with you. And they're just
[2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:20.640]  like, we don't want to communicate with you. We're in our club. We feel like we're winners.
[2:27:21.840 --> 2:27:26.640]  And it's the same on the right and the left. They're establishment wannabes. And they're
[2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:32.160]  going to destroy this country. They're going to destroy this country. And they imagine they got
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:37.600]  all this power because they invest themselves in Obama, or they invest themselves in
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:44.880]  Rick Perry, or they invest themselves in Rush Limbaugh. And it's an illusion. I mean, it's a
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:52.480]  mirage. And look, this new world order is going to destroy all of you people, all the blessings,
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:58.080]  all the good stuff, all the milk and honey, all of the free market. It's all going out the door.
[2:27:58.800 --> 2:28:04.720]  And on top of it, the big mega banks that are openly setting up the world government that
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:09.680]  you were taught doesn't exist. Now it's openly announced. You won't fight it because you said,
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:16.000]  well, if you're establishment, you don't admit this exists. You people are jokes.
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:21.680]  You're jokes. And you think you're winners. You giggle and smirk at real issues.
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:25.920]  You have no idea what you're allowing to take place. But look, it doesn't matter. You're a
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:30.960]  bunch of cowards. Just get out of our way. Get out of our way. We're going to restore the Republic.
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:35.120]  Get out of our way. Believe Obama's going to save you. Believe Rick Perry's going to save you.
[2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:40.160]  Get out of our way. We're going to restore the Republic. You understand? Let's play this clip
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:50.400]  of Ron Paul talking about. Sometimes these computers, I tell you. All right, we'll play it later.
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:55.520]  It's all right. Sometimes we don't save it. We don't have time and then it won't play off the
[2:28:55.520 --> 2:29:00.720]  internet. But we're going to come back and play this ad and we have to. We'll wait on Kaiser.
[2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:05.680]  We've just got to play the ad. I've announced it's coming and we're going to get to get to
[2:29:05.680 --> 2:29:14.560]  this new Ron Paul ad. It is up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com. If you want to get the
[2:29:14.560 --> 2:29:23.120]  article that has the video in it, you just go to info wars.com and you simply
[2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:32.640]  go to the article. Paul slams Perry as Al Gore's texture leader and he's got a new TV ad out
[2:29:32.640 --> 2:29:41.840]  that is absolutely the right medicine for Mr. Twinkle toes. Mr. Fake Tough God Texan, Rick Perry.
[2:29:41.840 --> 2:29:48.560]  Also, we've got a lot of other key news coming up official 9 11 fable to become part of school curriculum.
[2:29:50.320 --> 2:29:57.040]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:01.920 --> 2:30:06.800]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:12.320]  opportunity and recognized risk. Saving means to make money. The cow been pure soap company can
[2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:17.680]  save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated
[2:30:17.680 --> 2:30:22.720]  and twice as good as what you're using now. Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[2:30:22.720 --> 2:30:29.040]  that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials. Your risk is the hundreds of
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:34.960]  hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and a terrorizing clothing called
[2:30:34.960 --> 2:30:39.120]  lint. If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to
[2:30:39.120 --> 2:30:45.680]  do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091

[2:31:02.480 --> 2:31:07.680]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[2:31:07.680 --> 2:31:12.960]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power
[2:31:12.960 --> 2:31:17.920]  your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity
[2:31:17.920 --> 2:31:22.880]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[2:31:22.880 --> 2:31:28.400]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:33.600]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[2:31:33.600 --> 2:31:38.320]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[2:31:38.320 --> 2:31:42.800]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[2:31:42.800 --> 2:31:47.520]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information
[2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:54.400]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

[2:32:11.600 --> 2:32:19.280]  gussets. There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[2:32:19.280 --> 2:32:31.280]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in
[2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:41.040]  the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't. We turn jeans inside
[2:32:41.040 --> 2:32:47.440]  out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality. Our Defender Motorcycle

[2:33:22.720 --> 2:33:41.760]  Okay, here is the new Ron Paul TV ad. You can find it at infowars.com. Please get it out to everybody
[2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:46.560]  you know. Then we're going to Max Kaiser on the latest on the accelerating world economic meltdown.
[2:33:46.560 --> 2:33:53.920]  Here it is. The establishment called him extreme and unelectable. They said he was the wrong
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:34:00.240]  man for the job. It's why a young Texan named Ron Paul was one of only four congressmen to
[2:34:00.240 --> 2:34:06.960]  endorse Ronald Reagan's campaign for president, believing in Reagan's message of smaller government
[2:34:06.960 --> 2:34:14.560]  and lower taxes. After Reagan, Senator Al Gore ran for president, pledging to raise taxes and
[2:34:14.560 --> 2:34:21.760]  increase spending, pushing his liberal values. And Al Gore found a cheerleader in Texas named
[2:34:21.760 --> 2:34:28.080]  Rick Perry. Rick Perry helped lead Al Gore's campaign to undo the Reagan Revolution,
[2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:35.760]  fighting to elect Al Gore president of the United States. Now America must decide who to trust.
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:45.600]  Al Gore's Texas cheerleader or the one who stood with Reagan. Ron Paul, restore America now.
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:56.720]  They caught my devilish smirk of enjoyment. Texas cheerleader for Al Gore, that's who Rick Perry is
[2:34:57.440 --> 2:35:04.720]  and we have got to get the word out. We've got to defeat him. Now joining us is the inventor of
[2:35:04.720 --> 2:35:09.280]  the Hollywood Stock Exchange Virtual Trading System used on many markets around the world,
[2:35:09.280 --> 2:35:17.280]  a top broker in his own right, radio host, TV host, author Max Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com,
[2:35:17.280 --> 2:35:22.480]  joins us every week or so now because he's just been so spot on like Gerald Salente and others.
[2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:31.600]  Another reason to buy gold, Swiss, losing safety status, CNBC, markets are down 138 points. The
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:39.280]  Dow is right now or 1.23%. Everything is going according to plan, like we told you three years
[2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:46.320]  ago. They'd have QE1, QE2, things would only get worse and it's only really deepening the crisis
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:53.120]  we're entering. Instead of writing off the tens of thousands of trillions of different types of
[2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:58.960]  derivatives, all the garbage, instead of getting rid of that, instead of getting rid of the Ponzi
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:04.400]  scheme, the whole world must be fed into the wood chipper. And joining us to talk about the big
[2:36:04.400 --> 2:36:12.640]  developments, what this Swiss, lowering the Frank by 9% saying they're going to buy currencies to
[2:36:12.640 --> 2:36:19.360]  keep it low to try to hide the fact that currencies worldwide are devaluing. What is this all about?
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:23.520]  What's happening with the euro? What's happening with the dollar? What's the next shoe to drop
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:28.640]  Max Kaiser? Because you got attacked, I got attacked, many others did for saying that things were in
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:34.720]  a depression are only going to get worse. Now it's evident we were right. So where is this going now,
[2:36:34.720 --> 2:36:40.720]  Max Kaiser? Well, of course, of course, we were attacked because there's a war. There's a war on
[2:36:41.440 --> 2:36:46.960]  and they have to expect that they're going to be attacked. And for the people on the other side
[2:36:46.960 --> 2:36:52.960]  who are saying that I'm causing some of these problems, I would expect that to hear that from
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:37:00.640]  my enemy, the other side of this war. So this is to be expected as the war heats up. Now in terms
[2:37:00.640 --> 2:37:07.440]  of Switzerland, Switzerland in the last few years has really gone completely against everything that
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:12.960]  people associated with Switzerland. First, they abandoned the gold standard. They sold a lot of
[2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:18.880]  their gold. The Swiss central bank sold tons and tons of gold a few years ago. Then they allowed
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:27.840]  U.S. tax authorities to open up the accounts of United Bank of Switzerland, UBS, to foreign
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:34.240]  interests, which goes against the law in Switzerland. They allowed the U.S. to act extra
[2:37:34.240 --> 2:37:40.640]  to do judicial, to go into their own system and to probe accounts. Then now today they're
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:47.200]  saying they're going to peg the Swiss franc to the euro. In effect, anytime the Swiss franc
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:53.040]  gets to 120 to the euro, they're going to open the spigots and print Swiss francs infinitely,
[2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:58.400]  ad infinitum, which of course is going to cause massive inflation, which only benefits
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:03.280]  the people printing the money. Of course, the central global bankers once again. So Switzerland
[2:38:03.280 --> 2:38:09.760]  has fallen. Switzerland has fallen to the global banking cartel. And now I wouldn't be surprised
[2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:16.960]  if you see a gathering in some square in Zurich of the local Swiss people that are
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:23.120]  being screwed, like we've seen in Athens and Cairo in Wisconsin and Madrid all over the world.
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:27.520]  It's the global insurrection against banker occupation. Now it's hit Switzerland.
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:37.280]  Now, please continue, Max. Well, let me just bring something up,
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:42.240]  which I talked to Jared about it a little bit, getting into this Ron Paul situation.
[2:38:42.240 --> 2:38:48.160]  You know, not only are we have the voting machines that are rigged. We know this from
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:52.400]  previous elections. And not only do you have the polls that are rigged, and not only do
[2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:58.000]  you have the mainstream media that's rigged, but these so-called prediction markets are also rigged.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:05.600]  I'm looking at the biggest one right now. It's called intrade.com. And they have Ron Paul
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:14.000]  winning president contract up there at 3%. Now, this obviously doesn't reflect the current
[2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:19.680]  market. And the reason you get to a 3% probability is through market manipulation.
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:24.080]  And as you know, when you introduced me, I invented prediction markets. I invented
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:29.120]  virtual markets. And intrade is a ripoff of the Hollywood Stock Exchange that came along.
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:33.840]  A couple of the people that I used to work with started intrade. And I've written about how they
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:39.040]  manipulate markets and how dangerous it is when you are manipulating political markets.
[2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:44.160]  You know, every time you head into these elections, you have big news stories quoting the probability
[2:39:44.160 --> 2:39:50.640]  on intrade. But the intrade probability numbers are manipulated. And you can see it right now
[2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:55.920]  with the Ron Paul contract. They have a 3%. That's a manipulated number. Your listeners
[2:39:55.920 --> 2:40:01.360]  can go on to intrade right now. It's a virtual market they use, you know, pretend money. It's
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:07.440]  not real money. And they can play the intrade market and they can get his probability up higher.
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:13.200]  And in so doing, the media would be forced to report on that and to report on the fact that
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:19.360]  Ron Paul is now skyrocketing on the intrade political prediction market. They can also sell
[2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:25.840]  short. Those other two characters, Rick Perry and Mitt Romney, you can sell those two guys short
[2:40:25.840 --> 2:40:31.520]  on intrade and drive their probability down. So in other words, I've always said Alex, you've
[2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:38.080]  got to fight fire with fire. They use their platforms and counterfeit money and counterfeit
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:44.560]  media to present a counterfeit reality. To counterfeit, to counteract that, we have to
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:50.880]  go into the lion's den, go on to an intrade market, get Ron Paul up to a 50%, 60% probability of
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:55.760]  winning, then time will have to report that. Newsweek will have to report that. Droid Report will
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:41:01.520]  have to report that, as they've done in the last three presidential cycles, because it's a market,
[2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:05.680]  therefore it must be right. That's part of the market fundamentals of America. This is,
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:12.720]  you know, America's, you know, theocracy is based on worshiping market results. So if the
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:17.840]  market says it's what it is, and that must be with this direct word from God, the market God.
[2:41:17.840 --> 2:41:23.120]  But the problem is the system, the controllers are in there manipulating the market,
[2:41:23.840 --> 2:41:28.480]  and so creating a fraud, that's why they can say, well, it doesn't matter if he's winning on the
[2:41:28.480 --> 2:41:33.440]  internet. Ron Paul still can't win. Well, it doesn't matter if he's winning now in scientific polls,
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:38.640]  we still say he can't win. But more and more, they're losing control. And the next issue I wanted
[2:41:38.640 --> 2:41:44.400]  to raise, speaking of alternative media, becoming the new media, as you know, the Drudge Report,
[2:41:44.400 --> 2:41:48.800]  I really led with our articles last year, Exposing Big Sister's Lies. We've got a new
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:53.200]  big report coming out very soon by Paul Joseph Watson on this. But here's the headline,
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:42:00.560]  Janet Napolitano, Drudge is just wrong on privacy. Well, no, it's Big Sister's wrong.
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:04.800]  And she's like, how dare him put up photos of me where I look like an ogre? He's using real
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:09.520]  photos of her. How dare him run all these stories criticizing me? Well, most of those stories,
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:16.080]  especially last year, were our articles. This shows it's getting to the system that people
[2:42:16.080 --> 2:42:20.720]  aren't buying their lives anymore. So as we get to this crisis of credibility, where does it go
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:27.520]  from here with the establishment? Well, just a quick little follow up, just as you use the
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:33.680]  Google bombs to get stories listed on Google and therefore on mainstream media, I'm suggesting
[2:42:33.680 --> 2:42:40.000]  doing an in-trade prediction market bomb to make Ron Paul leader on that market and to get his
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:45.360]  name as winning all of the candidates that will have to pick mainstream media. The problem is
[2:42:45.360 --> 2:42:50.400]  the solution. Okay, your skype's breaking up a bit. Your skype's breaking up a bit. But just to
[2:42:50.400 --> 2:42:57.920]  be clear, you sent me a link, intrade.com, and it's got a link to 2012 presidential election winner,
[2:42:57.920 --> 2:43:04.320]  individual open to suggestion. How does an in-trade the prediction market site work? And so explain
[2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:08.160]  to, I mean, we have a lot of stock traders, others listening, but for the general public,
[2:43:08.160 --> 2:43:14.960]  how this works and what this does and what this means. Well, it's based on the technology that
[2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:19.200]  I invented, the virtual specialist technology. When you introduced me, you mentioned it every
[2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:25.360]  time, the virtual specialist technology patent number 159176, the Kaiser patent. You're able
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:30.400]  to take in a virtual currency market all the collected bids and offers or buys and sells and
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:38.560]  generate a price. Now, this is, I designed the technology as a way to manipulate the manipulation.
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:43.360]  Unfortunately, it has fallen into the hands of Wall Street banks. That technology is now owned
[2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:50.000]  by Cantor Foods Gerald and people like intrade who use this technology to use that platform to
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:56.960]  manipulate results. So the 3% probability of Ron Paul winning is the manipulated result and the
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:01.680]  way that, and I'm telling you as the inventor of the technology, the way to overthrow their
[2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:08.560]  manipulation is to do a Google bomb type in-rate attack to get masses of people to buy Ron Paul
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:14.720]  to presidential winner in 2012. And when he'd be hired than the other candidates on that site,
[2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:21.840]  it has to be reported by the news. Max, I understand that. Max, this is too important and I want to
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:26.720]  get to some other issues. You're joining us via video Skype, but we're going to just go to audio
[2:44:26.720 --> 2:44:30.880]  Skype with you here for a moment and come back to you because we're getting a bit more choppiness
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:37.200]  than we normally do when you join us from Paris where you live. But a very interesting idea that
[2:44:37.200 --> 2:44:42.160]  you have there. I want to get into gold and silver and the fact that gold went up, I don't know,
[2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:46.960]  60-something bucks today and they drove it back down. But regardless, you look at the 12-year
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:55.040]  graph, it's going straight up. Short term, where is gold going? Where are the other markets going?
[2:44:55.040 --> 2:44:59.920]  And where does this train end on the current trajectory of the world's financial markets
[2:45:00.560 --> 2:45:08.080]  with the men doing God's work like Lloyd Blankfein? Where does this insanity end, Max Kaiser?
[2:45:08.080 --> 2:45:14.240]  Well, if you'll indulge me one second here, if I can just take one other little digression.
[2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:20.400]  We've been talking about Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and all these banksters and how they've
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:27.680]  been interfering with markets and keeping prices like gold suppressed. I wanted to remind you
[2:45:27.680 --> 2:45:35.520]  of a story that came out last year about the Teamsters. Goldman Sachs had invested some of
[2:45:35.520 --> 2:45:41.200]  the pension funds of the Teamsters and they put their money into a fraudulent derivatives-based
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:48.640]  product that lost 60% of the value very quickly. What the Teamsters did was they went down to
[2:45:48.640 --> 2:45:52.960]  Goldman Sachs office and they said, either you give us your money back or we're going to break
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:46:00.240]  your legs. And guess what? Goldman Sachs gave the money back. The reason I bring this up is because
[2:46:00.240 --> 2:46:07.040]  it's foolish to think that when you're dealing with a gangster like Goldman Sachs, a terrorist like
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:12.400]  Goldman Sachs, that you're going to appease them by talking them into doing the right thing or
[2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:18.240]  acting in a moral way. They only understand one language and that is intimidation. That's the
[2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:24.640]  only language they understand. And the America has had their money stolen, trillions of dollars,
[2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:32.400]  and therefore it's incumbent upon Americans to seek redress. And since the courts won't help
[2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:37.600]  them and since there's nobody to help them, they have to do what the Teamsters did. Go down to
[2:46:37.600 --> 2:46:43.360]  their office and get your money back and intimidate them. It's a great story. It's on Google. You can
[2:46:43.360 --> 2:46:48.160]  do a search for it. I have it on my website. It's how the Teamsters beat Goldman Sachs. And I think
[2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:54.800]  that's a blueprint for the future. That answer your question on the gold. Where is it going?
[2:46:54.800 --> 2:47:01.360]  Obviously, gold is going much higher because it's the only currency in the world without what's called
[2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:08.400]  counter-party risk. It is what it is. You don't need like a derivative contract, two parties
[2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:14.960]  trading with each other to create the value between those two parties. Gold has a value
[2:47:14.960 --> 2:47:20.400]  unto itself. It has intrinsic value. And that's why it's always been viewed as a reliable currency
[2:47:20.400 --> 2:47:26.960]  for thousands of years. Now, during the post-Fiat currency era of 1971, going forward when Nixon
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:33.680]  went off the gold standard, essentially, we went into a period believing that Fiat money could
[2:47:33.680 --> 2:47:40.240]  replace gold. And the average lifespan of Fiat money, I just learned this myself, is 27 years.
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:46.320]  Now, the dollar has been around for 40 years as a Fiat currency. You have to think of it
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:52.080]  in those terms. The US dollar has only been around for 40 years in its life as a Fiat currency.
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:56.800]  Yeah, it's been a Federal Reserve note completely for at least 40 years. So it's only dollar in
[2:47:56.800 --> 2:48:06.160]  name only. It is a true absolute fraud. And so 40 years is very long in the tooth for a Fiat currency.
[2:48:06.160 --> 2:48:11.360]  I've done my own history. You're right. They rarely last past 30 years, very long in the tooth.
[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:15.920]  So we're coming to the end of an age. The bankers are saying, hey, bank of the world,
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:22.480]  you pay your carbon taxes, your VAT to us. We rule you. We've bought all the armies with Fiat
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:29.120]  dollars. How's that sound? Will the armies and the bureaucrats follow them straight into Hades,
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:32.240]  or will they wake up and start bringing these criminals to justice?
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:37.440]  Well, all the banks are consolidating. So the two biggest bankrupt banks in Greece
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:43.440]  have just merged. The stocks went up 30% that day. Now they're hitting all new all-time lows.
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:48.800]  The two biggest banks in France, Society General and BNP, they're not talking about merging.
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:53.600]  Bank of America, which of course is one of America's biggest banks. They just got a $5
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:58.240]  billion injection from Warren Buffett. They're now talking about going bankrupt, but instead
[2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:04.240]  they'll merge with some other entity like a city bank or a JP Morgan. So all these global banks,
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:08.960]  the two big to fail banks are becoming even bigger. They're merging again another huge
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:15.920]  round of mergers as a way to consolidate power in those very few bankers. So the trend toward
[2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:22.960]  this global superstructure of bankers who control everything underneath is well underway.
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:27.360]  And what we sacrifice with the people of Greece sacrifice, the people of Ireland sacrifice,
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:31.920]  Egypt, Tunis is sovereignty. That's what we have to give in return.
[2:49:31.920 --> 2:49:35.840]  Exactly. The people that engineered the fraud, it was in the news two weeks ago,
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:42.640]  EU dictatorship, financial council to rule. Who was that council? The big mega bank heads.
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:47.520]  I mean, it's incredible that they've gotten away with it this far. And so what I'm getting from
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:53.440]  UMACS is it just continues forever with them publicly robbing us, stealing everything with
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:59.120]  armed forces doing it because they're ballheaded and wear suits and everybody knows old ballheaded
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:04.560]  men can't hurt you. And so we've got to let them rule us. We've got to give our entire future to
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:13.440]  them because they're now God of this planet. Well, see the issue is that they are fraudulent and
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:20.720]  inauthentic. And as such, you can counterfeit endlessly. There's no entity amount of fiat
[2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:24.720]  money you can. And they don't mind wrecking things and always posing as the same. They control
[2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:30.640]  the so-called media. So they can wreck things and poses the savior and then always get more power
[2:50:30.640 --> 2:50:36.880]  and then wreck more, get more power, wreck more, get more power, wreck more blame other scapegoats.
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:43.440]  Folks really wake up, blow a building up, poses the savior. I mean, hand Libya to Al Qaeda. So what?
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:48.800]  I mean, I mean, it really is. So it just goes on and on with them trampling us and running over us
[2:50:48.800 --> 2:50:55.680]  and basically just until the public wakes up. But they won't. They like Rick Perry. They like
[2:50:55.680 --> 2:51:00.640]  the slick bacteria. They like it. When they hear about him going to transvestite bars, they get
[2:51:00.640 --> 2:51:06.240]  even more excited. Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes? Are you still smelling
[2:51:06.240 --> 2:51:12.240]  up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth and getting ashes everywhere? Why? When you

[2:53:00.640 --> 2:53:05.360]  You've been lied to. Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine, the government and the talking
[2:53:05.360 --> 2:53:10.160]  heads in the media. The market has proven that it's more like a casino than an investment.
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:15.280]  And if you've had enough and want to keep your hard earned money safe, this message is for you.

[2:54:14.560 --> 2:54:19.760]  Gerald Salente is going to be on a bunch of other information. We're putting a lot of work into this.
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:24.080]  We're going to be breaking down a lot of different facets and getting into some areas we didn't cover
[2:54:24.080 --> 2:54:30.320]  today. Labor leaders call for war on Republicans. Hoffa says, President Obama, this is your army.
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:35.920]  We are ready to march. Let us take these sons of bleepers out, but they're always saying those of
[2:54:35.920 --> 2:54:40.560]  us that don't want big government or the ones that want violence. Big sis attacks Matt Drudge.
[2:54:40.560 --> 2:54:46.640]  Says, don't call me an ogre. He never called you an ogre. Continuing, Texas dual. Ron Paul goes after
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:54.000]  Rick Perry. We've got those articles up. U.S. he's dropped on Israeli embassy in Washington.
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:55:00.080]  Former FBI employee sent its for leaking classified papers to an Israeli connected mole.
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:07.680]  That's all going on. You can see the wildfires from space going on in Central Texas.
[2:55:08.640 --> 2:55:12.400]  That amazing reports up at Infowars.com also DrudgeReport.com.
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:19.760]  There is just so much going on. Also, it turns out less insured people after Obamacare went through.
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:25.040]  Well, it was designed to do that. So this is just all part of the general free for all of corruption
[2:55:25.680 --> 2:55:33.520]  going on. Finishing up with Max Kaiser. Max, I was mentioning Libya and then during the break,
[2:55:33.520 --> 2:55:39.760]  you were saying you wanted to get into that. Even Reuters is admitting as so is RIA Novostat.
[2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:45.360]  EU official says Al Qaeda acquires weapons in Libya and it's now the main group taking over
[2:55:45.360 --> 2:55:49.680]  the major cities. That's completely confirmed. LA Times, you name it. Even Chuck Norris has
[2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:54.560]  got an article out talking about our article saying, why are they shifting from Al Qaeda to
[2:55:54.560 --> 2:56:00.000]  the American people? And, you know, why is our government helping Al Qaeda? Any comments on that,
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:05.680]  Max Kaiser? Well, yeah, I have a comment. It's kind of interesting. I haven't heard you talk about it
[2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:14.720]  yet. Unicredit, which is the biggest bank in Italy, their vice chairman was the head of the
[2:56:14.720 --> 2:56:22.720]  Libyan central bank. And the reason this is important is that when you now notice that the
[2:56:22.720 --> 2:56:28.960]  European financial crisis has gone into overdrive and Italy just in the last two weeks has now
[2:56:28.960 --> 2:56:34.560]  going into a major meltdown mode. This was an unintended consequence of going in there and
[2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:41.280]  mucking around in Libya, because Libya and Italy have this historic relationship going back decades,
[2:56:41.280 --> 2:56:46.640]  as people know. And there's tremendous amount of fraud and corruption between the Italian
[2:56:47.280 --> 2:56:51.840]  banking system, the biggest bank in Italy, Unicredit, and the Libyan central bank, which
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:56.080]  is a huge central bank, given the fact that they have all of the oil profits from all.
[2:56:56.080 --> 2:57:01.120]  Sure. It's only the black market keeping countries propped up and now that little deal's been screwed
[2:57:01.120 --> 2:57:06.800]  up. Yeah, exactly. So this is just an interesting side note that an unintended consequence. I
[2:57:06.800 --> 2:57:11.280]  doubt seriously that when the US stumbled in there or NATO stumbled in there, that they thought
[2:57:11.280 --> 2:57:15.440]  through their actions and realized that if you screw around with the central bank in Libya,
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:20.400]  you're going to trigger a massive European bank default, which is now in progress.
[2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:26.400]  And a destabilization of those tens of billions of dollars tied up, not just in Africa, but also
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:32.320]  in Europe. But why do you think they, at the end of the day, went into Libya and have now
[2:57:32.320 --> 2:57:38.640]  put Al Qaeda into control with reportedly them even getting heat-sinking missiles? We're told,
[2:57:38.640 --> 2:57:42.560]  give all our rights up, or Al Qaeda will sneak into the window and drink our blood at night,
[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:46.720]  like Nosferatu. But at the same time, Al Qaeda is good and friendly, and if you don't like them,
[2:57:46.720 --> 2:57:54.000]  you're evil. Well, you know, the history, the recent history is, of course, that Momar Gaddafi was
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:58:00.320]  on the terror list. But then he made good friends with Tony Blair, the prime minister of Britain.
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:06.800]  And magically, he was amazed, waved his magic wand, and he was part of the world community again.
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:11.600]  And they were doing oil deals and weapons deals. And Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan was now
[2:58:12.800 --> 2:58:17.920]  managing the Libyan sovereign wealth fund. And it looked great for Libya. And so you realize
[2:58:17.920 --> 2:58:23.120]  that the bigger terrorists are Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. They let the real terrorists into
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:28.720]  Libya. And now with the banking system in collapse as it is, and with the bankers in charge,
[2:58:28.720 --> 2:58:33.520]  there's no hope for that country at all. All right, Max Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com.
[2:58:33.520 --> 2:58:36.400]  Thank you for joining us. I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
