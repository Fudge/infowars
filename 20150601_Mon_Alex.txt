[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:37.320]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:37.320 --> 00:41.240]  ladies and gentlemen i just had to double take i can't believe that it's
[00:41.240 --> 00:48.920]  already june 1st 2015 on this worldwide monday edition i'm your host alex jones
[00:48.920 --> 00:53.760]  we have several extremely informative guests joining us today we're going to
[00:53.760 --> 00:59.200]  be looking at the aftermath of the amazing speech that ran paul gave
[00:59.200 --> 01:03.920]  yesterday's now become gop enemy number one for actually being a
[01:03.920 --> 01:09.000]  constitutionalist he's come out and said that his opponents quote secretly want
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.720]  terror attacks they can blame it on me that clips coming up after the break but
[01:12.720 --> 01:17.240]  first here's a segment of where he really laid it all out from c span
[01:17.240 --> 01:22.960]  yesterday let us be very clear why we're here this evening we are here this
[01:22.960 --> 01:27.480]  evening because this is an important debate this is a debate over the bill
[01:27.480 --> 01:33.000]  of rights this is a debate over the fourth amendment this is a debate over
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.080]  your right to be left alone just as brand I said that the right to be left
[01:41.080 --> 01:47.640]  alone is the most cherished of rights the right to be left alone is the most
[01:47.640 --> 01:55.800]  prized to civilized men let us be clear we are here tonight because the
[01:55.800 --> 02:02.200]  president continues to conduct an illegal program sensational the president
[02:02.200 --> 02:07.960]  has been rebuked by the court the president has been told in no we're
[02:07.960 --> 02:12.760]  going to come back after the break and air a full five six minute piece then
[02:12.760 --> 02:18.280]  we're gonna air the clip of where ran paul senator from Kentucky talks about
[02:18.280 --> 02:25.000]  the fact that they hope there's a terror attack so he can be blamed the fact that
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.360]  no other republican has the guts to do what he's doing shows you really how
[02:31.360 --> 02:37.320]  controlled both political parties are where are the democrats where are the
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.080]  republicans well they're being blackmailed because a bunch of them are
[02:42.080 --> 02:52.840]  criminals of different stripes probably the biggest contingent or pedophiles and
[02:52.840 --> 03:00.320]  they're compromised and here's ran paul with a wall of deceit across the media
[03:00.320 --> 03:06.560]  including republican right-wing establishment talking heads saying
[03:06.560 --> 03:11.080]  that he doesn't want to keep us safe and what's terrorist to attack us really
[03:11.080 --> 03:15.440]  it's our rogue government that openly armed al-qaeda and isis and syria
[03:15.440 --> 03:21.560]  libya and other areas like egypt they're the ones that dissolved our borders
[03:21.560 --> 03:26.480]  they're the ones using the patriot act in nsa against veterans the tea party
[03:26.480 --> 03:33.320]  libertarians and conservatives there's also this claim was snowed and now that
[03:33.320 --> 03:37.960]  we can finally all talk without being surveilled there are several other
[03:37.960 --> 03:42.560]  patriot act like laws that they've snuck through that basically quote
[03:42.560 --> 03:48.320]  authorized what's going on but the body of it is illegal and they were doing it
[03:48.320 --> 03:54.960]  before they'd ever passed these laws so believe this it's still going on
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.960]  headline on drudge free to chat without nsa tracking at least for now and it's
[03:59.960 --> 04:03.520]  good to say that because in the public starts thinking about it and thinking
[04:03.520 --> 04:08.000]  about how laws affect this and yes you can technically go with what they say
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  yes we've stopped now recording everything including your phone
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.480]  conversations not just the quote metadata who you called and when and boy
[04:17.480 --> 04:24.520]  we're wide open to terror attack but that itself is a lie so we'll break it
[04:24.520 --> 04:36.280]  all down today video up on info wars.com Rand Paul declares big victory for
[04:36.280 --> 04:42.560]  privacy China fearless to fight war with us says their state media
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.640]  Obama announces draconian unconstitutional gun rags by executive

[04:54.160 --> 04:58.720]  housing crash that's coming stay with us

[05:03.760 --> 05:07.800]  than knowing the star-spangled banner it's knowing the Constitution it's
[05:07.800 --> 05:12.080]  understanding those rights and fighting for them our country's falling apart
[05:12.080 --> 05:16.360]  because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and do
[05:16.360 --> 05:20.440]  the right thing it's putting your life on the line to protect your country from

[07:09.200 --> 07:14.680]  average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single

[07:59.160 --> 08:12.960]  you can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amuck
[08:12.960 --> 08:17.520]  but when you actually look at the details then I think we've struck the
[08:17.520 --> 08:21.880]  right balance and if people can't trust not only the executive branch but also
[08:21.880 --> 08:28.920]  don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're
[08:28.920 --> 08:33.000]  abiding by the Constitution due process and rule of law then we're gonna have
[08:33.000 --> 08:41.800]  some problems. The Alex Jones show because there is a war on or your mind.
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.120]  Of course multiple federal courts have ruled that major provisions of the
[08:49.120 --> 08:56.800]  Patriot Act are unconstitutional that NSA bulk data collection is illegal but
[08:56.800 --> 09:03.520]  President Obama knows that his constituents are dumber than a box of
[09:03.520 --> 09:11.960]  hammers dumber than a bag of rocks and so he can just sit up there and lie to
[09:11.960 --> 09:16.880]  everybody or say oh my gosh we're about to be hit by a terror attack because the
[09:16.880 --> 09:24.560]  Patriot Act elapsed last night at midnight and Rand Paul it's gonna be his
[09:24.560 --> 09:31.440]  fault when terrorists attack us. When the federal government working bipartisanly
[09:31.440 --> 09:36.200]  has opened the southern border up basically wide open and pays to bring
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.000]  illegals in and allows radicals to come in and then start organizing at major
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.440]  mosque calling for terror attacks across the United States and our own
[09:45.440 --> 09:50.000]  government has been arming ISIS and Al Qaeda all over the Middle East to topple
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.120]  secular governments and destabilize the region and even judicial watch last
[09:55.120 --> 10:00.080]  week got the defense intelligence documents from two years ago where the
[10:00.080 --> 10:08.120]  Pentagon admitted its main directive was to arm Al Qaeda by name along with Al
[10:08.120 --> 10:15.760]  Nazra by name and the Salafist by name. You wonder why our military has been
[10:15.760 --> 10:20.400]  speaking out and why you've seen the thousands of photos of officers covering
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.240]  their faces with signs saying I won't fight for Al Qaeda and why General
[10:24.240 --> 10:29.360]  Dempsey two years ago went on that Saturday night on the eve of an attack
[10:29.360 --> 10:36.320]  on Syria and told Obama the military is going to go mutinous. Well it's not
[10:36.320 --> 10:41.840]  mutiny we've got a rogue government that's illegitimate engaging in public war
[10:41.840 --> 10:49.440]  crimes in our name. So anyone that gets up there and says that Rand Paul wants
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.000]  terror attacks to happen is a complete fraud. Rand Paul has said secure our
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.600]  border. By the way people ask why I like Rand Paul the best of any of the
[10:55.600 --> 11:01.760]  candidates. It's not that I've known him for 20 years. I'm proud of the fact that
[11:01.760 --> 11:10.480]  I'm probably the first person to ever interview Rand Paul for political
[11:10.480 --> 11:17.920]  discussions. Back when his father was running in 1995-96 I'd just gotten my
[11:17.920 --> 11:22.760]  radio show. I just had Rand Paul on and I said well who else can come on this is
[11:22.760 --> 11:26.360]  such a close race because back then his district came right up to South Austin. I
[11:26.360 --> 11:30.920]  was in his district at the time and they said gee we don't know who you could
[11:30.920 --> 11:36.120]  have on his campaign managers you know doing these interviews and I said well
[11:36.120 --> 11:42.280]  who else is around he goes well you could interview me and I said really Rand I
[11:42.280 --> 11:46.200]  didn't know you didn't tell me you were his son yeah no I'm taking time off for
[11:46.200 --> 11:54.720]  my practice. I'm a doctor to help my dad so I'm on the phone with Rand Paul I
[11:54.720 --> 12:05.000]  said well yeah you come on that's true story and I just know he's for real but
[12:05.000 --> 12:11.240]  separating all of that he has separated himself from the pack by doing
[12:11.240 --> 12:17.000]  something that's bold. Stand up for the Constitution stand up for the Bill of
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.200]  Rights stand up for common sense call out the president and say what he's doing
[12:21.200 --> 12:27.160]  is illegal and treasonous on the Senate floor and he's had the entire
[12:27.160 --> 12:31.920]  establishment come after him. Here are the headlines Rand Paul my opponents
[12:31.920 --> 12:39.880]  secretly want terror attack so they can blame it on me. Video Rand Paul speaks
[12:39.880 --> 12:43.440]  out against the Patriot Act I don't think the American people are going to
[12:43.440 --> 12:48.040]  take it anymore that's the type of talk that saves countries. Getting people out
[12:48.040 --> 12:51.880]  of their trance saying don't take it anymore we're in a crisis this is
[12:51.880 --> 12:59.160]  outrageous they label all this tyranny real milk toast. The Patriot Act just made
[12:59.160 --> 13:05.000]  Rand Paul GOP enemy number one that's the headline.
[13:07.320 --> 13:12.880]  Meanwhile zombie Patriot Act will keep US spying even of the original dies
[13:12.880 --> 13:19.800]  that's right we're going to break it down and some will ask well if they're
[13:19.800 --> 13:24.320]  still doing it then what's the point because then we force them to do it
[13:24.320 --> 13:27.600]  illegally and then there'll be more whistleblowers and then the whole thing
[13:27.600 --> 13:35.920]  will implode and it's coming out they're using the NSA to spy on Congress it's
[13:35.920 --> 13:46.520]  coming out it's coming out that all of this is being done and being deployed
[13:46.520 --> 13:53.480]  against the American people and it's forcing the Daily Beast Newsweek magazine
[13:53.480 --> 13:58.760]  to come out and admit that there are all these other illegal systems going on
[13:58.760 --> 14:02.840]  back when they thought we put up with anything they had Admiral Poindexter the
[14:02.840 --> 14:06.600]  head of the total information awareness network that's the corporate private
[14:06.600 --> 14:11.440]  group with governmental power over 800,000 private contractors domestically
[14:11.440 --> 14:17.200]  merging all the spy agency data which then allows total infiltration by foreign
[14:17.200 --> 14:21.640]  governments and corporate espionage giving 800,000 private contractors
[14:21.640 --> 14:28.360]  access to basically all of it and then putting them in place a system we should
[14:28.360 --> 14:31.840]  get William Benning on sometime this week just to give us his take on all
[14:31.840 --> 14:37.400]  this former technical director of the NSA then having computer systems in place
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.080]  so no one can tell who accesses the network
[14:42.360 --> 14:49.240]  designing it so that we're wide open and our security is destroyed through a
[14:49.240 --> 14:57.800]  panopticonic omnipresent big brother on steroids system and then selling it as
[14:57.800 --> 15:03.640]  Americana and then calling the man who's speaking out against it a traitor
[15:09.080 --> 15:12.880]  so they're doing two things they're going oh don't worry the spine is
[15:12.880 --> 15:16.560]  continuing to keep you safe Rand Paul failed no he didn't fail he showed
[15:16.560 --> 15:23.360]  leadership and stood up against this technological takeover that's happening
[15:23.360 --> 15:33.760]  this this this technocracy and it shows how far we've sunk into tyranny that
[15:33.760 --> 15:40.920]  it's radical that it's over the top that it's shocking that a senator would get
[15:40.920 --> 15:46.360]  up and say we can't have illegal total spying recording everything the
[15:46.360 --> 15:53.360]  American people do in a free country everyone knows that's the antithesis of
[15:53.360 --> 15:57.280]  a free country everyone knows they admit they haven't stopped one terror attack
[15:57.280 --> 16:02.200]  with all this data because it's not even pointed at that it's pointed at taking
[16:02.200 --> 16:07.840]  our freedoms rigging markets understanding globalist competition so
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.440]  they can shut it down it's about cornering the global market in everything
[16:12.440 --> 16:20.760]  they've built in the last seven years five mega cities huge multi hundred
[16:20.760 --> 16:29.800]  thousand square foot per building some cases eight nine ten buildings that are
[16:29.800 --> 16:35.280]  hundred thousand square feet or more that are their own compact cities
[16:36.440 --> 16:41.600]  openly recording everything we do forever so they can data mine it and pull
[16:41.600 --> 16:45.760]  up an entire record of everything you've ever done whenever they want and it's
[16:45.760 --> 16:49.400]  all illegal and they have the nerve to get up on television
[16:49.400 --> 16:56.800]  mine it takes a lot to shock me my mouth was hitting the floor last night
[16:56.800 --> 17:01.320]  during the Sunday a two-hour radio show we do every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. I went
[17:01.320 --> 17:10.400]  back in the break room was getting a glass of water and CNN was on I think we
[17:10.400 --> 17:16.240]  even have the clip and they had the host going along with the person they were
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.080]  interviewing taking turns who could grovel to the Patriot Act and the NSA
[17:21.080 --> 17:25.520]  and big brother the most and the host goes all we're doing is following the
[17:25.520 --> 17:30.240]  Constitution the Patriot Act is the Constitution and Rand Paul is trying to
[17:30.240 --> 17:35.800]  destroy it there is no spying no one is being watched it none of it's true it's
[17:35.800 --> 17:39.560]  a conspiracy theory and now the terrorists are gonna attack us and then
[17:39.560 --> 17:43.440]  they cut to the guest and they just basically agreed to everything they
[17:43.440 --> 17:48.440]  said I mean it was inverted reality like what senator Marco Rubio got up a few
[17:48.440 --> 17:54.720]  weeks ago and said there is no NSA spying domestically period it does not
[17:54.720 --> 18:00.640]  exist and you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor and it'll cut your
[18:00.640 --> 18:05.120]  premiums or it's gonna be free and of course they admit now and a big article
[18:05.120 --> 18:10.800]  in Politico yesterday that there's massive increases right now huge over
[18:10.800 --> 18:18.200]  the top increases across the board under Obamacare in premiums on average 50% a
[18:18.200 --> 18:22.720]  year how's that for free but see they call it the Affordable Care Act so it's
[18:22.720 --> 18:31.760]  okay what do they call the new Patriot Act a similarly sickening name it'd be
[18:31.760 --> 18:37.120]  like throwing babies into woodchippers and the cops pull up and you go I'm
[18:37.120 --> 18:42.840]  only engaging and take your child to work day and I am a greenskeeper a
[18:42.840 --> 18:46.720]  forester and so I'm just running a woodchipper and I'm showing my child how
[18:46.720 --> 18:51.640]  it work is throwing a child in the woodchipper I mean this is the inversion
[18:51.640 --> 18:58.240]  of reality let's go ahead and go to Rand Paul talking about how they secretly
[18:58.240 --> 19:03.400]  want to blame terror attack on him here it is well here in town think I'm
[19:03.400 --> 19:08.160]  making a huge mistake some of them I think secretly want there to be an
[19:08.160 --> 19:12.840]  attack on the United States so they can blame it on me one of the people in the
[19:12.840 --> 19:16.560]  media the other day came up to me and said oh well when there's a great attack

[19:20.280 --> 19:26.640]  the people who attack us are responsible for attacks on us do we blame the police
[19:26.640 --> 19:32.760]  chief for the attack of the Boston bombers the thing is is that there can

[24:09.680 --> 24:14.400]  there's a man the perception has been created including by political figures
[24:14.400 --> 24:17.920]  that serve in this chamber that the United States government is listening
[24:17.920 --> 24:21.280]  to your phone calls or going through your bills on them as a matter of course
[24:21.280 --> 24:26.960]  that is absolutely categorically false the next time that any politician
[24:26.960 --> 24:31.360]  senator congressman talking head whatever it may be stands up and says
[24:31.360 --> 24:35.000]  that the US government is listening to your phone calls or going through your
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.160]  phone records they're lying it just is not true except for some very isolated
[24:42.160 --> 24:46.560]  instances in the hundreds of individuals for whom there is reasonable
[24:46.560 --> 24:52.320]  suspicion that they could have links to terrorism and that is absolute patented
[24:52.320 --> 24:58.960]  lies from all the NSA whistleblowers exposing it and what's admitted remember
[24:58.960 --> 25:01.960]  the folks that weren't even Muslims in Florida that ordered some pressure
[25:01.960 --> 25:07.960]  cookers to cook seafood in and they got SWAT teamed I mean that the everything's
[25:07.960 --> 25:13.600]  being watched your locations being tracked by your phone I've told people
[25:13.600 --> 25:17.080]  about that 20 years ago they didn't believe it now it's all out in the open
[25:17.080 --> 25:22.120]  the head of the CIA portrays three years ago came out admitted your
[25:22.120 --> 25:28.280]  appliances are watching you Samsung in their terms of the conditions says that
[25:28.280 --> 25:32.160]  the camera and microphones listening to you and sending it to third parties so
[25:32.160 --> 25:40.200]  quote watch what you say but they sit up there with the authority of the Senate
[25:40.200 --> 25:45.640]  in their fancy suits and lie to you I mean look at this political headline USA
[25:45.640 --> 25:55.880]  freedom act versus USA patriot act how about USA lovey flowers act versus the
[25:55.880 --> 26:03.920]  USA sweet puppy dog act how condescending how insulting that it's an
[26:03.920 --> 26:09.600]  America Republic killing 180 degrees opposite from what we were founded on
[26:09.600 --> 26:18.680]  July 4th 1776 at Independence Hall the complete flipside the complete inverse
[26:18.680 --> 26:25.200]  the upside down bizarro world of the scum that came out four years ago and
[26:25.200 --> 26:29.480]  again this year when investigations got started and said Congress is allowed to
[26:29.480 --> 26:34.440]  insider trade no one else is we're allowed to own companies and then give
[26:34.440 --> 26:39.960]  them government contracts oh it's okay that my wife or in the case of dine
[26:39.960 --> 26:46.920]  feinstein her husband owns a multi-billion dollar biotech company
[26:46.920 --> 26:49.560]  that we're gonna give billions of dollars it's taxpayer money there's
[26:49.560 --> 26:53.480]  nothing wrong with that because we had a committee hearing and we voted on it and
[26:53.480 --> 26:57.200]  said it was okay hey why don't you just go ahead and vote that it's okay that a
[26:57.200 --> 27:02.520]  bunch of you are pedophiles so you haven't gotten us there yet though you're
[27:02.520 --> 27:09.080]  trying they're just a bunch of out-of-control con men and women Harry
[27:09.080 --> 27:13.800]  Reed all of them they're a bunch of hypocrite jokes like let me cover this
[27:13.800 --> 27:18.080]  the next hour all the new moves to get our guns Obama promised executive
[27:18.080 --> 27:21.760]  action well it was in Politico it was in the hill yesterday we have an article
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.680]  red linked on info wars comm they're coming to assault the gun owners the
[27:25.680 --> 27:31.760]  gun shows to ban the 556 the 223 to ban the variants of the rifles they're
[27:31.760 --> 27:39.000]  coming just like they said they would they're coming how about if they just
[27:39.000 --> 27:47.000]  ban all guns all civilian arms and just call it the USA freedom act I mean come
[27:47.000 --> 27:55.280]  on USA freedom USA USA USA everything is wonderful everything is awesome how
[27:55.280 --> 27:58.760]  about that free Obamacare oh I'm sorry I cut your prices oh I'm sorry and increase

[28:10.160 --> 28:13.040]  on average they know you don't buy what they're doing they keep acting like
[28:13.040 --> 28:19.000]  everything's normal as they put money in their Swiss bank accounts as they buy
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.040]  houses overseas as they get ready to flee the country because they know when
[28:23.040 --> 28:27.480]  the housing bubble pops and the banking money bubble pops and when all the
[28:27.480 --> 28:31.360]  inflation starts hitting with depressionary cycles under it with stag
[28:31.360 --> 28:37.680]  inflation that you're going to be upset
[28:41.920 --> 28:45.640]  let's go back to Rand Paul the clip we already played that I'm gonna come back
[28:45.640 --> 28:49.920]  with five minutes that we haven't gotten to yet where he says his opponents
[28:49.920 --> 28:55.520]  secretly want terror attacks so they can blame it on him here it is oh here in
[28:55.520 --> 29:00.640]  town think I'm making a huge mistake some of them I think secretly want
[29:00.640 --> 29:05.200]  there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me one
[29:05.200 --> 29:08.840]  of the people in the media the other day came up to me and said oh well when
[29:08.840 --> 29:12.040]  there's a great attack are you gonna feel guilty that you caused this great
[29:12.040 --> 29:17.120]  attack and it's like the people who attack us are responsible for attack
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.360]  yeah yeah since when was there this idea that we've got to preemptively take
[29:21.360 --> 29:25.240]  all your rights to keep you safe from an attack and then you look at who the
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.080]  attackers are it's a bunch of Saudi Arabians that are double agents with
[29:29.080 --> 29:37.400]  Western intelligence with their idiot followers that they recruit I mean it's
[29:37.400 --> 29:42.280]  real simple criminals in our government are running radical Islam as a pretext
[29:42.280 --> 29:47.240]  to terrorize us into submission radical Islamics are the gun the globalist hold
[29:47.240 --> 29:51.360]  to our head they're holding us hostage we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:51.360 --> 30:00.160]  run time to call their bluff Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the Pentagon
[30:00.160 --> 30:04.960]  admits it accidentally sent a shipment of live anthrax to as many as nine
[30:04.960 --> 30:10.280]  laboratories in the US as well as a lab overseas a CDC investigation of this
[30:10.280 --> 30:14.520]  mistake is underway and at the time there is no known risk to the general
[30:14.520 --> 30:18.920]  public the anthrax samples were shipped from an army facility in Utah to
[30:18.920 --> 30:23.560]  government and commercial labs in Texas Maryland Wisconsin Delaware New Jersey
[30:23.560 --> 30:28.040]  Tennessee New York California and Virginia the labs were working as part of a
[30:28.040 --> 30:33.200]  Pentagon effort to develop a new diagnostic test to identify biological
[30:33.200 --> 30:38.160]  threats in the environment dead or inactivated agents were expected but
[30:38.160 --> 30:43.440]  one lab reports being able to grow live axillus anthrax the safety failure comes
[30:43.440 --> 30:47.840]  on the heels of increased scrutiny of bioterror agents and their oversight
[30:47.840 --> 30:52.440]  around the country last June more than 80 people may have been exposed to live

[34:29.720 --> 34:33.880]  judges then we're gonna have some problems what difference at this point
[34:33.880 --> 34:52.560]  doesn't make everything is cool when you're part of a team that's right we're
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.640]  told that everything is awesome we're told that everything is wonderful and
[34:57.640 --> 35:03.520]  how dare one senator out of what 500 people in Congress the House and Senate
[35:03.520 --> 35:09.440]  a hundred in the Senate how dare one person stand up and say why are we
[35:09.440 --> 35:15.800]  building giant cities all over the country of just huge buildings full of
[35:15.800 --> 35:21.280]  computers recording everything we do and by the way obsessing on what
[35:21.280 --> 35:25.040]  government does is only one part of the story what about corporations what about
[35:25.040 --> 35:31.240]  companies what about the fact that a total control grid can be hacked and
[35:31.240 --> 35:38.440]  taken over what about how the smart homes and smart cars can easily be
[35:38.440 --> 35:44.560]  hijacked this is the real issue that we're discussing here today is a
[35:44.560 --> 35:50.680]  revolution by the technocrats to take over society look at these headlines
[35:50.680 --> 35:58.480]  senators flash anger at Paul and vice versa US lawmakers pile on as Rand Paul
[35:58.480 --> 36:07.040]  forces counterterrorism laps the Patriot Act and the NSA on their own
[36:07.040 --> 36:11.800]  admissions have never stopped one terror attack in this country you can pull
[36:11.800 --> 36:17.160]  that headline up from last week it has nothing to do with terrorism most
[36:17.160 --> 36:22.000]  terrorism is funded by the criminals that run at this government and others
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.680]  doesn't mean our whole government doesn't mean the military doesn't mean the
[36:25.680 --> 36:29.800]  police the media always spends that and says you mean the cop down the street
[36:29.800 --> 36:34.720]  carried out 9-11 when you say government no criminals running our government
[36:34.720 --> 36:39.000]  bare minimum open the door funded the terrorist and allowed them to attack and
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.280]  then use that crisis to take American freedoms and point the biggest police
[36:43.280 --> 36:49.080]  state the world's ever seen at the American Patriot and now they say we've
[36:49.080 --> 36:55.960]  got to surveil you because domestic terror attacks are coming and this is
[36:55.960 --> 37:03.440]  how far we've fallen that it's seen as bizarre that it's seen as weird to have
[37:03.440 --> 37:08.720]  a senator get up and say we should have a debate about the bill of rights and
[37:08.720 --> 37:17.880]  Constitution do we want to go 1984 or do we want to go 1776 and Paul said I'm
[37:17.880 --> 37:23.520]  not going to take it anymore and neither are the American people and let's see of
[37:23.520 --> 37:26.880]  the American people really want freedom now because if we want to be held
[37:26.880 --> 37:32.640]  hostage and told the big bad boogeyman's gonna kill us if we don't let the
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.240]  government take all our rights well then we deserve what we get I mean come on
[37:36.240 --> 37:40.680]  folks we know we don't get security by having a giant mega-sized government
[37:40.680 --> 37:47.000]  spying on every facet of our lives we know that we understand that and just as
[37:47.000 --> 37:54.440]  I said 15 years ago back in October of 2001 when they passed the Patriot Act I
[37:54.440 --> 38:00.840]  said over and over again bigger than Dallas this will be used in non-terror
[38:00.840 --> 38:08.080]  related cases it's what the legislation says but forget the legislation that's
[38:08.080 --> 38:16.320]  just a thin veil cover the DEA for 20 plus years had more access to the NSA
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.480]  database than the NSA did they kept it compartmentalized because the DEA is
[38:21.480 --> 38:25.360]  part of the CIA arm that brings the narcotics in and then shuts down
[38:25.360 --> 38:30.640]  competition and that's why the NSA has it in place where you can't see who goes
[38:30.640 --> 38:34.800]  into the database because the DEA and others are going into the database with
[38:34.800 --> 38:38.680]  parallel construction and seeing that say you're growing marijuana or you're
[38:38.680 --> 38:42.400]  doing whatever or you smuggle in cocaine yourself out of Mexico a few
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.520]  kilos you're going to sell it they don't want you to drive down prices they don't
[38:46.520 --> 38:49.640]  want you to be able to have money that the big banks don't control this is
[38:49.640 --> 38:55.280]  about vertical integration consolidation and so they're going to go and
[38:55.280 --> 38:58.120]  they're going to bust you and you're going to wonder why but in court when
[38:58.120 --> 39:02.640]  they indict you they're going to say that oh this informant witnessed you do
[39:02.640 --> 39:07.400]  it and then they got a wiretap and then they were able to record you when it
[39:07.400 --> 39:10.440]  turns out a year before they already knew everything you were doing and when
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.560]  created a fake investigation and perjured themselves in front of the judge who
[39:14.560 --> 39:19.400]  knows full well every day the DEA is in front of him or her in their court with
[39:19.400 --> 39:24.560]  a fake case made up and the sick argument is well you were a drug dealer so
[39:24.560 --> 39:32.720]  it's okay and I'm not defending drug dealers I mean a drug dealer of
[39:32.720 --> 39:38.360]  narcotics or other hard drugs is a predator and would be engaged in some
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.920]  other criminal activity of drugs warning legal so I don't like the criminal
[39:43.920 --> 39:47.640]  culture let me tell you I don't like the criminal culture at the fake drug war
[39:47.640 --> 39:53.760]  creates corrupting the police again ten years of prohibition prohibition ends
[39:53.760 --> 39:58.880]  in the early 1930s they need something new to be illegal so they made everything
[39:58.880 --> 40:04.240]  at the drug store basically illegal you could buy anything you wanted and drug
[40:04.240 --> 40:11.000]  abuse was a lot lower than it is now look at the numbers they made it
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.320]  illegal now it had a lot of money involved now the prostitution money went
[40:15.320 --> 40:20.040]  to it now the robbery money went to it now the shakedown money went to it now
[40:20.040 --> 40:25.040]  people would do anything to get their cocaine or heroin and now you could buy
[40:25.040 --> 40:28.560]  it on the street not pay taxes on it you could buy off the police with that
[40:28.560 --> 40:34.120]  money and you could keep control of your mafia systems I don't care if you were
[40:34.120 --> 40:40.080]  the Italian mob the Irish mob the last mob the Jewish mob those are the real
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.880]  mobs in this country and in a mob war when the Italian mafia tried to muscle in
[40:44.880 --> 40:51.280]  on the Jewish mafia a few buttons got punched a few switches got flipped the
[40:51.280 --> 40:54.880]  FBI got turned loose on them because until the late 40s early 50s
[40:54.880 --> 40:59.440]  La Cosa Nostra didn't exist Jagger Hoover said so the Congress it was a
[40:59.440 --> 41:06.640]  conspiracy theory that the mafia even existed and now today because of
[41:06.640 --> 41:11.600]  Hollywood we only think the mafia is Italian that shows you how controlling
[41:11.600 --> 41:17.920]  these systems are what a joke the real mafia is the CIA all run by a bunch of
[41:17.920 --> 41:24.840]  guys from Yale and Harvard the real mafia is Hollywood the real mafia is the DEA
[41:24.840 --> 41:31.640]  and then the FBI are the errand boys that run around busting all the low level
[41:31.640 --> 41:36.720]  people for the mafia and that's what they've been since the days of Jagger
[41:36.720 --> 41:42.960]  Hoover but they had lots of movies for you though where the where the FBI is
[41:42.960 --> 41:49.200]  out busting the bad guys yeah they were only allowed to bust a few cheesy
[41:49.200 --> 41:58.040]  flamboyant over-the-top Italians they were not allowed to bust anybody else
[41:58.040 --> 42:01.440]  and that's the facts about organized crime not all the real Italian crime
[42:01.440 --> 42:08.360]  families and again the real reason the Italian crime families got rooted out
[42:08.360 --> 42:11.400]  is exactly what you see in the movie the Godfather that's a composite of real
[42:11.400 --> 42:14.680]  events that actually happened the names have been changed Mario Puzo gave
[42:14.680 --> 42:19.840]  speeches where he died admitting that because they wouldn't run child sex
[42:19.840 --> 42:24.400]  slavery and pedophile rings and wouldn't bring in narcotics and sell them to
[42:24.400 --> 42:33.040]  kids and so they got pushed out because they wouldn't be part of that see
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.520]  there's the rest of the story
[42:36.520 --> 42:44.240]  we're a nation of chumps ladies and gentlemen the big banks run the whole
[42:44.240 --> 42:49.400]  show they launder the money they own the aircraft and they fly drugs in kids
[42:49.400 --> 42:59.840]  out drugs in women out drugs in stolen art and jewelry out and if they can
[42:59.840 --> 43:03.320]  though when they want to get your five-year-old out of the backyard they
[43:03.320 --> 43:07.120]  got some folks in Thailand or Saudi Arabia to sell them to and when they're
[43:07.120 --> 43:10.840]  done your child's gonna be tortured to death and nobody's coming to help them
[43:10.840 --> 43:14.400]  because you're trendy and you go to fake churches to tell you everything's okay
[43:14.400 --> 43:18.600]  and you turn on the TV and watch all the cop shows where everything's all right
[43:18.600 --> 43:24.520]  and it's not all right it's not all right
[43:24.520 --> 43:38.800]  so just remember that stop being naive because while we sit here so amicably
[43:38.800 --> 43:48.480]  chatting the most wicked synthesis of evil the planet's ever seen is taking
[43:48.480 --> 43:55.440]  over the real mafia puts hydrofluorosalistic acid in the water that
[43:55.440 --> 44:00.200]  eats your glands and eats your brain and gives you pancreatic cancer and bone
[44:00.200 --> 44:06.200]  cancer and brain cancer and lowers your IQ up to 15 points after just six years
[44:06.200 --> 44:19.560]  of exposure at 1.3 parts per million just remember that's who we're dealing with
[44:19.560 --> 44:24.040]  you think they're hardcore oh they're hardcore and the good news is thanks to
[44:24.040 --> 44:27.120]  the majority of government scientists going public and admitting that it's a
[44:27.120 --> 44:31.000]  plan to brain damage the public they've been forced to cut it by 50% out of the
[44:31.000 --> 44:36.400]  water and abandon it as a pesticide and only raise that because need to realize
[44:36.400 --> 44:41.720]  folks we're dealing with some hardcore killers here but when their confidence
[44:41.720 --> 44:48.240]  came collapses it's over for them now ladies and gentlemen before I get to the
[44:48.240 --> 44:52.520]  Rand Paul speech I haven't played yet want to make a very important announcement
[44:52.520 --> 44:56.760]  out of all the products we sell at inforwarslife.com it helps fund our
[44:56.760 --> 45:02.400]  operation so it's a win-win-win 361 as I call it you get the biggest effect I
[45:02.400 --> 45:05.240]  at least personally had other folks have from super male or super female
[45:05.240 --> 45:11.320]  vitality but I found that when I don't take it with a survival shield x2 nascent
[45:11.320 --> 45:16.400]  iodine that it doesn't work as well and it is the survival shield deep earth
[45:16.400 --> 45:24.840]  pure 9999 crystal source everybody else has it from seaweed which is fine but
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.480]  this stuff turns bright blue electric blue purple on paper when you put a drop
[45:29.480 --> 45:36.000]  of it you know with water or by itself on paper because it's true iodine the
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.040]  other stuff out there is like a hundred to sixty year old recipe and I'm not
[45:39.040 --> 45:41.880]  against it but you know it's why people feel sick when they take it and just
[45:41.880 --> 45:47.280]  doesn't have the same effect this is the good halogen that blocks and goes into
[45:47.280 --> 45:51.840]  thyroid all the other bad halogens hydrofluorosalic acid the fluoride the
[45:51.840 --> 45:58.240]  bromine the chlorine those are all the bad halogens this stuff's so pure that
[45:58.240 --> 46:04.840]  you put a little crystal of it on a hot plate it turns purple and turns into gas
[46:04.840 --> 46:08.840]  in the air and that's what we inject directly into the palm oil and that's
[46:08.840 --> 46:14.240]  what you get is the absolute organic pure essence with zero contaminants in our
[46:14.240 --> 46:18.880]  test of the purest cleanest most powerful iodine in the world warning
[46:18.880 --> 46:24.840]  within two weeks of taking it most people go through detox to consult your
[46:24.840 --> 46:32.440]  physician this stuff is rocket fuel rocket fuel this the globalists are
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.600]  obsessed with iodine themselves and we've even got a lot of you know famous
[46:36.600 --> 46:40.080]  people you name it rich folks buying this because they know all about it we've
[46:40.080 --> 46:47.000]  been contacted by huge big wigs and nutraceuticals you name it I mean I don't
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.360]  know why anybody else wouldn't actually go out and get a mind source of this but
[46:50.360 --> 46:57.480]  that's what we got we're in contact with our exclusive deep earth crystal
[46:57.480 --> 47:00.840]  supplier and we are being told that the supply of these crystals is running low
[47:00.840 --> 47:05.400]  at our drilling site we're looking into digging deeper in the earth we already
[47:05.400 --> 47:09.480]  dig over 7,000 feet below the surface with expensive drilling technology and
[47:09.480 --> 47:12.960]  sure that our crystals are super pure and free from radiation other contaminants
[47:12.960 --> 47:17.520]  I've been sitting on this information for weeks while we try to secure a larger
[47:17.520 --> 47:21.680]  supply but folks Fukushima is getting worse than ever and it's time to prepare
[47:21.680 --> 47:25.520]  a bottom line 70% of the original radioactive meltdown was dumped to the
[47:25.520 --> 47:29.160]  Pacific Ocean and we know it's already hitting the United States now more than
[47:29.160 --> 47:33.600]  333 containers holding nuclear waste are known and admitted to be damaged and
[47:33.600 --> 47:38.800]  leaking and could explode with hydrogen explosions each one being a new Fukushima
[47:38.800 --> 47:43.440]  experts are saying a major hydrogen explosion could occur at Fukushima which
[47:43.440 --> 47:48.480]  we've been told again would be worse than Chernobyl if you're not preparing
[47:48.480 --> 47:52.880]  yourself you're crazy I take survival shield x2 every day and I have an
[47:52.880 --> 47:57.760]  entire supply stored away in an emergency storage case x2 stores for
[47:57.760 --> 48:03.920]  years so if you can't get it now while we do have it in stock and store some away
[48:03.920 --> 48:10.000]  your your nuts we suggest you do bulk discounts do apply for two five and ten
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.800]  packs it's no BS folks that this is one of our most powerful important things
[48:15.800 --> 48:23.040]  we've ever done and you can see the over 345 reviews on infowarslife.com the
[48:23.040 --> 48:27.200]  average five stars this is no joke and I'm sure we're going to be able to get
[48:27.200 --> 48:30.960]  more of the crystals but we are running low on our current supply we have one
[48:30.960 --> 48:35.840]  last batch being made and then we've got to secure more of the crystals we ended
[48:35.840 --> 48:42.280]  up getting the crystals because of economic espionage our competitors I'm
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.000]  not in competition with people but folks think they get a bigger market by
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.800]  knocking somebody else down it's not actually how it works you have to grow
[48:48.800 --> 48:52.160]  markets overall but we're just trying to help people and have a win-win and
[48:52.160 --> 48:57.960]  funder operation trying to shut down our sources of pure clean iodine from ocean
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.440]  based systems and while they were busy shutting that down for a while with the
[49:01.440 --> 49:06.480]  DEA because this is a controlled substance in bulk not as a dietary
[49:06.480 --> 49:10.440]  supplement because you can do a lot of stuff obviously with the raw form I mean
[49:10.440 --> 49:16.960]  it's it's just a super element we were going around looking everywhere for
[49:16.960 --> 49:21.760]  other sources and found this amazing nutrimentical grade form that's a by
[49:21.760 --> 49:27.280]  product when they're drilling super deep into the earth and you've got to just go
[49:27.280 --> 49:33.760]  through a lot of gesticulations a lot of paperwork a lot of jumping through
[49:33.760 --> 49:38.200]  hoops to get it we've brought it to you there's nothing else like it out there
[49:38.200 --> 49:42.320]  and compared to other iodines it's just amazing but if you're not going to get
[49:42.320 --> 49:45.800]  our iodine it is good to get the Himalayan salts other sea salts that
[49:45.800 --> 49:50.120]  are known to have the ocean-borne forms of iodine it'll do amazing things for
[49:50.120 --> 49:53.840]  you as well that's why the government until the 60s from the 20s of the 60s
[49:53.840 --> 49:58.800]  ordered it to be put in the salt because they knew it was good and and help the
[49:58.800 --> 50:02.280]  glands and help battle goiter and a whole bunch of other disorders that were
[50:02.280 --> 50:06.720]  plagued in the country and they admit that IQs went up more than 15% you can
[50:06.720 --> 50:11.960]  just search engine that in the Midwest within one generation after they had it
[50:11.960 --> 50:16.400]  put in the salt then they removed it and of course add the bad halogen to the
[50:16.400 --> 50:20.440]  water so they know exactly what they're doing and good scientists are battling
[50:20.440 --> 50:24.080]  this inside the government that's why they just cut fluoride by half and we'll
[50:24.080 --> 50:27.360]  see if the water districts actually do that but we're having major victories

[54:26.880 --> 54:32.600]  sit there and say that Rand Paul is going to let us be attacked by terrorists
[54:32.600 --> 54:37.080]  when John McCain's doing nothing to secure our borders and has been tacitly

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:27.160]  Alex Jones. We've been playing excerpts of Rand Paul's super historic just
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:35.720]  amazing light in a dark room speech and I was thinking about Admiral Poindexter
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:44.320]  wrote a article where he was heavily quoted in the article it was titled
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:53.040]  total information awareness network New York Times and it was in 2002 this is
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.440]  when I thought everybody was scared and would do whatever whatever the system
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.440]  said and it's just says everything you do is tracked everything you do is
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.720]  recorded we're gonna watch everything you do it's gonna be an internet of
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:10.120]  things everything will be tracked by smart meters this is the new America under
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:15.680]  the total information awareness network there it is total information awareness
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:24.880]  by Jeffrey Rosen and it breaks it all down I mean Rand Paul ought to just get
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.480]  up and read that on the Senate floor where they quote him saying all this in
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.360]  fact you print me that article I want to read some of it we're gonna cover the
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:39.040]  second amendment with a guess coming up in the next segment and then we'll get
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.560]  into China's a fearless to fight with US state media a bunch of economic news
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.760]  teachers threatened with fines for violating Michelle O's school lunch
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.240]  rules because in a free society you're supposed to have everything your kids
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.000]  eat federalized and I have the first lady lecturing you but let's go back to
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.320]  Rand Paul's historic speech this is what we fought the revolution over are we
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:08.640]  going to so blithely give up our freedom are we going to so blithely go
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:14.760]  along and just say take it well I'm not gonna take it anymore I don't think the
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.880]  American people are gonna take it anymore 80% of those under 40 say we've
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:25.520]  gone too far that this whole collection of all of our records all the time is
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:31.320]  too much the court has said how can records be relevant to an investigation
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:36.680]  that hasn't started the court has said that even under these lower standards
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.560]  even under these standards of saying that it would be relevant that all of the
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:49.640]  stuff they're collecting is precisely irrelevant now people say well they're
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:54.520]  not looking at it they're not listening to it it's the tip of the iceberg what
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.200]  we're talking about here and realize that they were dishonest about the
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.600]  program until we caught them they kept saying over and over again we're not
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:10.040]  doing this we're not collecting your records and they were the head of the
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:17.440]  intelligence agency lied to the American people and he still works here we
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.960]  should be upset we should be marching in the streets and saying he's got to go
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:29.080]  we can't allow this we can't allow the rule of law to be so trod upon that we
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.120]  live in an arbitrary governmental world where they collect anything they want
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.960]  anytime they want they may kill him this is the tip of the iceberg they're
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.680]  collecting records through executive order they're collecting records through
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.040]  section 702 now do you know why I love Rand Paul? People say how will we protect
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.120]  ourselves without these programs what about using the Constitution what about
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:58.680]  using judicial warrants the Sonarif boy the Boston bomber they say how will we
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:05.480]  look at his phone records get a warrant put his name on it you can get a warrant
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.440]  there's no reason the world the guy had already bombed us you think anybody was
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:15.160]  gonna turn down a warrant we should have gotten a warrant before get warrants on
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.920]  people we have suspicion on the Simpson guy that was shot in Garland he'd
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:26.520]  already been arrested we had suspicion let's hire a thousand more FBI agents
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.600]  let's hire people to do the investigation and quit wasting time on
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.840]  innocent American people man this is good let's be very clear while we're here
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:43.320]  President Obama set this program up the president Obama who once was against the
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:48.320]  Patriot Act the president Obama who once said you know what we should have
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.680]  judges right warrant the president Obama who once believed we're gonna go to
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.240]  break is the president we'll cover the attack on the second amendment straight
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:00.840]  ahead and more with senator Rand Paul well it looks like the Justice
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.520]  Department wants to ban more Americans from owning guns that's right
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:11.160]  president Barack Hussein Obama is proposing new firearm regulations that
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.600]  will revoke gun rights from those the government declares to be mentally
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.200]  unfit and that's a scary thought considering the fact that the official
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:26.480]  diagnostic system for mental disorders in the US the DSM 5 is so broad that
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:31.480]  almost every form of human behavior can be diagnosed as some type of mental
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.480]  illness for example in 2012 the Department of Veteran Affairs sent out
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:41.200]  letters to US military veterans to inform them that their competence levels
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.800]  were under review and if the federal government rated them incompetent they
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.920]  would be prohibited from purchasing possessing receiving or transporting a
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:55.160]  firearm or even ammo for more details on this story plus all today's breaking

[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.200]  since 99 for guns and ammo handguns and gun magazines he's a panelist selected
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:38.520]  by the New York Times blog to discuss the Virginia Tech shootings again David
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:46.560]  Kodria joins us we see the brainwashing where they come out and say
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.120]  there's more gun crime than there's ever been when we know it's down well
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:55.720]  professor lot was here about a month ago he said it's down 61% but we crunched
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.880]  the Justice Department numbers which we know they got caught last year trying to
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:05.520]  make it look worse than it was under White House orders unprecedented but
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.600]  still that's 51% drop in crime using guns since 1992 and those numbers are
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.520]  public even the LA Times had to admit gun crimes down but perception is it's
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:22.240]  up and that's because of the brainwashing in Hollywood and movies and TV and
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.920]  in the culture from people basically following the orders of the Attorney
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:39.360]  General who said just brainwash the public to not like guns but look at
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.760]  what happened with the terrorists attack up in Garland folks had guns they
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.400]  were taken out look at what the head of Interpol called for last year he said
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.360]  it's time for arming people like they do in some areas of the U.S. so we don't
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.840]  have mall shootings the answer to bad people with guns is good people with
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.120]  guns but I'm not going to go over all the tried and true known facts the bigger
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:06.080]  issue here is a whole new assault is coming extra legislatively extra
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:14.080]  judicially directly from the gun grabbers themselves and they're now
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:18.800]  admittedly when we had mr. lot on professor lot of dr. lot a few three
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.200]  four weeks ago is they're coming out with fake statistics now just like they
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.400]  got caught with fake statistics on how positive gay marriage is and how
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:33.080]  wonderful it is and how wonderful those relationships are and how people once
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:37.400]  they're exposed to it love it I'm not even bashing gays it's not even on my
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.480]  radar screen the point is it came out last week it was fake studies at major
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:51.200]  universities so from fake studies to fake crime statistics to now fake videos
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.440]  which you could tell their actors I mean they think the public is so dumb
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:58.760]  David's here to break it down for us David thank you for coming on the
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:05.160]  broadcast today well Alex thanks very much for having me on it's great to you
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.600]  know have your crew reach out to me like this because this is an important
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:15.080]  story because everything that the anti-gunners do is based on a lie you
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:20.640]  know you mentioned dr. lot and they're trying to now take his studies which
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.960]  prove that guns in the hands of private citizens deter crime and they're trying
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.120]  to say oh well you know that's that's not true they're trying to take the
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.680]  studies out of people like Gary Cleck who talks about the number of defensive
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.080]  gun uses per year and say oh that's not true so all they ever present is the
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:42.320]  cost of so-called gun violence which is overwhelmingly done by criminals who if
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.360]  you take a look at their existing laws are not allowed to have guns anyway and
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:52.280]  we see how well that works all of these things are aimed at us peaceable
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.280]  American gun owners it's no surprise to see this administration is trying to do
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.960]  things through executive order it's also no surprise to see this being
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.920]  spearheaded by the Justice Department and it's no surprise to see that the
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.360]  Republican establishment has been so silent on this right up through to and
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.400]  including the Loretta Lynch confirmation as Attorney General I mean who is
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:20.560]  surprised that she is not a continuation of Eric Holder and that she is a
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.080]  creature of the Obama White House David Kodria.com is your website where
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.520]  folks can link through and see all the amazing articles that you write for
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:34.400]  multiple magazines and publications Kodria's CODREA David Kodria.com again
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.800]  I'm Alex Jones this is the Alex Jones show he just joined us he also writes
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.680]  for examiner.com David if gun owners are awake we know they're coming after our
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.000]  guns we know their predatory we know it's about to tellitarianism finally
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.520]  people are getting hardcore it's while we're beginning to gain some ground but
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:57.680]  the Empire striking back how do you expect this to play out when they come
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.760]  in with all these new executive actions outside of law to restrict the Second
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.360]  Amendment will it be like California where it's kind of a cold war against gun
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.560]  owners or could Obama go offensive out in the open with some really draconian
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:17.640]  moves. Well I expect to see him test the limits using executive actions and then
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.880]  of course what that unfortunately does is that creates a victim in the system
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.000]  and then we're entered into the legal system where things are long and drawn
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.680]  out and then you get an activist judge to say oh no this is fine this is okay and
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.960]  I think what we're seeing is a new paradigm not not among Americans because
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.320]  civil disobedience is a long and time-honored tradition among Americans
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.840]  but on gun owners we've kind of been conditioned that you know what we have
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:48.080]  these lobbying groups and if something goes wrong what we do is we we write a
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:53.240]  form email that tracks to our representative or our senator which
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.960]  does of course absolutely no good if your senators are Diane Feinstein and
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:02.040]  Barbara Boxer okay so we're seeing a new paradigm among gun owners that is
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:07.160]  basically illustrated by the I will not comply movement that we see exemplified
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.280]  in Washington state and now recently over the weekend in Oregon state that
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:17.640]  had an I will not comply rally to protest their basically new law that says
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:24.120]  that it's illegal for you to transfer your property to someone else and just
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.240]  last year well we gave the first speech since the Alamo was basically
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:35.720]  destroyed in 1836 the state land commissioner basically came in and
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.640]  said no we're going to have a second amendment rally there undoubtedly that's
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:43.040]  what the folks died for there was the right to keep my arms when Santa Ana
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.120]  said turn your guns in and about 1500 people showed up every race color and
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.560]  creed to give a speech there violating the city law saying no open carry of
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.480]  handguns or rifles and we violated it right in front of the police because it
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:03.040]  violated state law and it violated the Constitution and this is what it's all
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.360]  about so we do see the rise of the activist gun owner that's got to be
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.520]  scaring the anti gunners well it no doubt scares the anti gunners I think
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.240]  that it also causes a degree of discomfort among the establishment gun
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:22.000]  lobby organizations that here before have basically been able to control the
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.400]  narrative and to count on their lobbying efforts and and their public
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.280]  relations effort to tell the gun owners side of the story and that's why I'm
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.920]  good I don't knock that I believe in that I've been doing that for decades but
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.280]  what I also believe is that there comes a time when you have no other recourse
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.640]  and now the rubber meets the road you have to say I'm either going to obey
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:47.640]  this idiot or I'm going to defy and resist this eating and no one can make
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.360]  that decision for you except yourself well the establishment I think has
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:56.640]  taken our restraint as a sign of weakness when instead we've been preparing
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:02.760]  making political inroads warning people setting up political defenses but I
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.440]  think now they've gone from being arrogant to really starting to realize
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.960]  we're not backing down we're not going away they may have dumbed down half the
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:16.080]  population but still there is a giant group of Americans across section that
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:22.160]  is growing that is not going to submit yeah I've seen people who had their
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.240]  lives destroyed case in point Wayne Fincher out of Arkansas who constructed
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.160]  his own machine gun had had perfectly constitutional justification for doing it
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.560]  it was not something that was entered into interstate commerce to give any
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:39.920]  kind of pretext to get a tax imposed on this thing and he was sentenced to six
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.840]  and a half years the judge actually denied the reading of the Constitution in
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.240]  his trial and the poor man was so harassed by the end of things that when
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:55.080]  his wife died while he was in prison the authorities would not let him out on a
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:00.080]  controlled release to attend her funeral this is you got to take it down to the
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:04.320]  human level I mean not just to tell anecdotes but to let people understand
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.480]  this isn't just something that you'll read about in the news this has effects
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.440]  on real people this has effects you who are watching this on your freedom well
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.680]  that's another point I was going to ask you when we come back from break they
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.600]  will they seem to persecute veterans libertarians conservatives gun owners
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.080]  people with no criminal records people that assault the earth with vitriolic
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.440]  pleasure how do they get people at the ATF and other agencies because I've had
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.360]  a country at the gun show and get my face when I'm just there you know giving
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:42.880]  a speech the ATF why do they hate us so much why do they hate good people so
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.000]  much I mean how did they get who are these people because you've been you

[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.560]  I haven't yet had some more of Rand Paul and his historic speech yesterday but
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:34.160]  worldwide there are corporate robber baron interest on record they don't
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:38.040]  even deny this anymore they're taking over whole countries and the first thing
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:42.840]  they want when they take country over is a disarm the public this is not brain
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:48.560]  surgery or rocket science and people could say yeah well Hitler you know he
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:52.600]  didn't take the guns with with new laws he already had laws on the books yeah he
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:58.240]  used already existing laws the point is this will always be used to oppress and
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:06.440]  people finally get this they understand this point and then I see the feds that
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:11.440]  are involved in their war against the Second Amendment and they just from what
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.560]  I've seen hate the guts of the American people but that doesn't mean a group of
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.280]  federal marshals I run into protecting a vice president are bad guys they're
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.080]  listeners guys I ran into or doesn't mean all the FBI guys you know hate
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:30.400]  patriots in fact most cops in national studies or our pro-second of them it's
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.800]  like 98% so there's kind of a paradox here where you've got special political
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:42.920]  kind of commas our units of the federal government that really are you
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:47.160]  surping this country and I guess to do that job they've got to decide we're the
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:54.440]  bad guys but how do they get their mind around that David that's tough to
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.840]  actually come up with a definitive answer on all you all you can really do
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.720]  Alex is go based on experience you know I'm from the generation I suspect you are
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:08.200]  too that we were raised thinking that Ephraim Zimbalist on the FBI or Peter
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.960]  Graves with his impossible mission force were not a threat to civil liberties
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.520]  they were out there protecting us we couldn't conceive of a Maloy and Reed on
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:22.240]  Adam 12 coming in on a no-knock raid and shooting our poodle and you have all
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.120]  kinds you know we had within the ATF we had some whistleblowers come forward
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:30.680]  these guys were raised thinking that they were doing a service that they were
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:35.840]  protecting they're different in a way they they didn't really though study
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:42.840]  things like the federal's papers and and the thoughts of the founders but there
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:48.520]  are another group altogether that seemed to take a sadistic pleasure in the
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:53.960]  power if I could segue for a second in a past career I was responsible for
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:57.920]  getting permits from several major cities in Cal in Southern California and
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.840]  just the level of power trip that you would meet in city clerk offices so
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:08.760]  that's it exactly it's the power trip you see in private sector in government
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:14.800]  it's people on power trips yeah and and unfortunately when you get people on
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:20.040]  power trips with authority and with weaponry calling the shots you get
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.120]  essentially the new brown shirts that are more than happy to enforce the new
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:28.680]  intolerable acts and for those people who say well you know this is America we
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:32.400]  have the right to free speech we have the right to vote it can never happen
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.160]  here I bet just somebody in Weimar Republic would have said you know this
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.520]  could never happen here we're the most civilized country in Europe I think you
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.240]  hit on something there I think we've gotten to the point where people finally
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.480]  understand it can happen here and it is happening here have we hit that wake up
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:52.440]  moment and then how do these two forces the immovable object the unstoppable
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:58.000]  force what happens when they collide I believe that we're almost at a stalemate
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:05.520]  I pray sometimes that the people who want to oppress us aren't stupid enough to
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:12.240]  pull the trigger I fear sometimes that they are and if and when they are I think
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.800]  that they're going to be surprised that there is going to be a critical mess
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:20.160]  doesn't have to be doesn't have to be everyone my friend Mike Vanderbilt
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:25.040]  estimates it's something like 3% of the columnist took up arms against the
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:31.480]  British and if we had numbers like that it would just be vastly outnumbering and
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.000]  and again we're not talking about coming out in Wellingtons where as to meet
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.880]  Napoleon on you know on the field of battle or anything like that we're
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:43.880]  basically talking about what I alluded to earlier everyone has to make the
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:49.600]  decision for himself I am either going to obey and capitulate and surrender or I
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:55.280]  am going to defy and if necessary resist unfortunately that kind of leaves us on
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:00.040]  our own unfortunately if you try to organize that lends itself to agents
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.360]  provocateur and infiltrators and people trying to get the low-hanging fruit to
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:09.720]  do dumb things so that they can then further justify exactly against the
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.920]  public and and of course you know wild headlines to scare the sheep into
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.240]  thinking that well we got sure but I mean what look 3% started the
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.360]  Revolutionary War 5% wanted that's historically admitted by a lot of
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.680]  professors that have been the analysis as you said I think if it does kick off
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.840]  physically which we're trying to avert I think we're going to be surprised it's
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:34.520]  going to be like 10% of the gun owners are gonna end up standing up and there's
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:39.160]  170 million gun owners 150 million gun owners I mean we're talking about we're
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:44.040]  talking about 15 17 million people and if the globalist couldn't take back dad
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:47.240]  I mean you know for all their bravada and all their arrogance they're going to be
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:53.600]  deep in you know what we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:57.280]  the GCN radio network
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:04.640]  police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:10.120]  tool called stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:16.680]  and text messages without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the FBI
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:21.240]  who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.840]  agreements forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:30.160]  needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment and
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:34.480]  they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying where we
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:39.160]  now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:44.400]  people who are not even suspected of any crimes once again more evidence that

[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:07.640]  spending the news they get arrested with guns the illegal areas like airports
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:13.320]  and he cast the nerve to get up on MSNBC and say quote gun owners are racist
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:20.680]  people in the country scared of blacks that's all they've got is to invoke
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.840]  race instead of going let's look at where we have gun control Chicago DC New
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:30.480]  York highest crime rates liberal democratic areas disarming black people
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:35.120]  and then letting crime run rampant and of course the first gun laws were against
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:40.680]  black people in this country it is such a bank robin I played the Fox News clip
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:46.680]  Fox Sports clip I played ESPN clips I remember the talking point last year
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:52.720]  that the NRA is the new clan the NRA was founded to fight the clan they
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:59.080]  inverse everything I've been at gun rallies and had people walk up and go
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:03.640]  you're just a big fat racist I'm talking about white yuppies and I really am
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:08.800]  sick of them they have no intellectual acumen they have no historical
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:13.000]  understanding all they have is arrogance of their totalitarian cult they are not
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.600]  liberals it's liberal to keep more of your money it's liberal to have your
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.560]  own property it's liberal to raise your kids as you see fit it's liberal to be
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:25.000]  able to associate with who you want it's liberal to not be spied on it's
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.800]  liberal to be able to have guns to protect yourself it's liberal to be
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:35.040]  able to travel where you want it's liberal to read and have knowledge and to
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:43.920]  have more freedom not less that's liberal not totalitarian but you have
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.080]  these mental midgets in fact I played a clip yesterday I'm typically played again
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:50.400]  my son went out to see if we could duplicate what happened in New York and
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:57.240]  Times Square where no one knew what the TPP was the Trans-Pacific Partnership and
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:05.920]  Austinites were just as dumb they didn't know what planet they were on well
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:12.600]  they could talk about racism you're not conspiracy theorist are you you're not
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:25.640]  racist are you that's all they could say it's amazing when you have knowledge
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:29.880]  that's all they say is conspiracy theory and then it makes them feel superior
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:35.480]  because they know a magic $5 word we're gonna go back to our guest here in a
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.280]  moment to finish up with the attack on the Second Amendment and where it's
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.240]  going and talk about this article that Kate Daniels wrote about that our guest
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.160]  broke gun control group deceives public by hiring paid actors I want to talk
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:51.920]  about that for hidden camera experiment but before we do that we have made an
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:57.560]  America section of ballcaps belt buckles long-sleeve shirts short short
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:04.800]  sleeve shirts women's cut shirts with gold foil Molan Lombay available at

[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:15.960]  expensive t-shirts that are not made in the US but it's your decision info
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:20.760]  wars store.com and we have this hat that I believe the best-looking ball cap I've
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:26.560]  ever seen made in America super high quality it simply says 1776 it has a
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:32.440]  little gads in flag rattlesnake on the side and says made in 1776 on the back
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:38.640]  and and I wear this hat out I wear the black t-shirt that goes along with it
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:44.320]  that you can get and people invariably invariably and it is expensive this is
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:48.920]  made America and it's high quality it's expensive compared to other hats that
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:54.920]  are made in China and people come up to me and they say what's 1776 mean it's
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:59.680]  non-threatening but it's a great conversational piece now separately I
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.280]  had the idea when Pac Sun got criticized and and banned an upside-down American
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.640]  flag and I'm sure they probably did mean it as a disrespectful thing that's a big
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:13.280]  leftist thing to hate the American flag and try to ban it or burn it we come out
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.600]  with a shirt that says save America with an upside-down flag with the US flag
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:23.080]  code under it and then on the back it says our republic is in distress ask
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:29.160]  me why info wars.com ask anybody that flies flags upside down at their house
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.600]  or on their truck it will cause conversations well this is a great
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.720]  shirt to get people asking questions and it says ask me why and the shirt is a

[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:05.280]  the writer for guns and ammo magazine handguns you name it he's also his

[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:13.960]  gun rights defender of the month by the Citizens Committee on the right to keep
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:18.160]  and bear arms and journals the year by the Second Amendment Foundation I want
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.200]  to kind of give you the floor for the last 10 minutes and anytime you want it
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:26.320]  you can call for the video we can play it or just roll the video behind you but
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:31.600]  I wanted you to have some time to get into some other Second Amendment subjects
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:37.240]  that we haven't covered. Well first of all about the video I think it's important
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:43.800]  that we clear up that everybody knew that the actors were actors in this video
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:49.000]  I don't think it surprised anyone except the so-called progressives and you're
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.080]  absolutely right they use racism as the new scarlet letter the R instead of the
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:58.960]  A to try to make us afraid to speak out because then they'll call us bad names
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.520]  they call themselves progressives what they are is the exact opposite of that
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:09.000]  which is why I say every day for them is opposite day but what I did with this
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.640]  report was I filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:17.960]  mayor's office of film and entertainment in the city of New York and I proved
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:22.000]  that they were actors I mean we all suspected it because they walk into this
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.760]  gunstore this big gunstore which we knew was fake we knew that the guy behind the
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:33.000]  counter at the gunstore was fake he's an actor he's done voice work for oh gosh
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.640]  one of the video games I think it's a Grand Theft Auto 5 or something like
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.720]  that which which was actually so violent that they banned it in Australia from the
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:49.640]  Kmart's and stores like that there but we knew this was a fake setup there I
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:54.800]  see the guy right there and we knew that these were fake guns as well because in
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:00.080]  New York you can't even go into a gunstore and handle the gun unless you
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:03.840]  first apply for a permit and then of course you see these guys that are
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:09.200]  breaking Jeff Cooper Colonel Cooper the gunners gurus rule against putting your
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:15.880]  finger on the trigger every one of them invariably is basically doing unsafe
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:20.760]  gun handling practices because you always treat all guns as if they're loaded
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:24.600]  and you never stick your finger on the trigger until you're ready to actually
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.040]  fire a shot and you have the gun properly aimed you know your target you
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:33.800]  know what's behind it that's just basic common gun sets which the other side
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:39.200]  of course says and claims for their own and of course with progressives every day
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:45.160]  is opposite day by proving that these were actors this puts to the lie the sham
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:51.160]  that they were doing a social experiment with hidden cameras to debunk gun
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:56.880]  myths no they weren't they had actors I know from the permits that they brought
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:01.360]  in 45 crew members I know from the permits that they brought in five trucks
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:06.200]  what I don't know from the permits though was all those hundreds of replica
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.120]  firearms that they brought in and when I asked the mayor's office about that
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.800]  their response on the phone was oh well the NYPD was there and they were
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:19.320]  making sure that these weren't real guns and so no permits were needed well
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:25.000]  yeah there are entire standards first of all in New York and in New York City
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.080]  against imitation firearms that that tightly control those there are
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.800]  standards within the film industry that they have to comply with and so the fact
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.320]  that I did not get any permitting information or any documentation on the
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:46.160]  city the NYPD saying that these guns were okay also raises the question of well
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.920]  then they weren't accounted for either you have no idea what they were you have
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.160]  no idea how many there were you have no idea how they were transported nobody
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:58.440]  signed in for them and receiving nobody signed in for them to send them back so
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:01.720]  that we should let me just briefly interrupt you David Codrie is our
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:06.840]  guest David Codrie calm it's about the culture of deception obviously anybody
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:10.880]  that's a gun owner and knows any basic facts could tell us was a fraud guns
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.640]  don't say on them I killed a little boy or I killed an old lady but for the
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:20.240]  progressives that are so ignorant they thought it was real this thing's
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:24.960]  designed it shows the video the hidden cameras being put in they attempted to
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:29.960]  run this fraud thinking the general public is as dumb as they are and I find
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:36.480]  it's so apropos so poignant so fitting so perfect that you've got a guy involved
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:40.600]  in indiscriminate ultra violence or you know video game where they rape women
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:47.280]  and shoot people and run folks over with violent video games connected directly
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:51.680]  to psychotic breaks with Prozac heads killing people and then they have the
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:57.320]  nerve to try to restrict us it's just over the top sorry yeah now that is
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:00.800]  part and parcel but the other people that have fooled Alex and this is what's
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:06.360]  really disturbing is it fooled the media elites who were reporting on this as if
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:10.320]  it were real I'm writing an article right now a matter of fact my deadline is
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.640]  later this afternoon for guns magazine I am a field editor I do their rights
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:20.320]  watch column for them every month and basically I'm analyzing ad week which is
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.280]  like the number two trade publication in the advertising industry and the guy
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:29.400]  who wrote the article on that was under the assumption that the guns were real
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:34.040]  that the people were real they actually had their minds changed by these
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:39.400]  powerfully persuasive arguments of the anti-gunners and on top of that he's
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.040]  basically saying yes these were actually the guns that were used in the
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:48.960]  times like like you're gonna have Adam Lanz's bushmaster okay and and you're
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:53.520]  going to be having that in a retail store for retail prices the first time
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:57.480]  gun buyers and it's not going to be like impounded right now and some I think
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:01.240]  you're giving him too much of a benefit of the doubt here the media just needs
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:05.680]  an excuse to run hoaxes I think they probably know it's all fake this is
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:09.840]  what they do that there's a new level of lying is what I'm saying they they
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:16.480]  seem to have tripled down yeah no I can't argue with that it just seems
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:22.320]  amazing though I run into not only the outright deception but I run into
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:26.120]  ignorance all the time too you know where where somebody you know a cop gets
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:30.680]  involved in a shooting and uses his Glock and the reporter refers to it as his
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:34.440]  service revolver so I mean there is a tremendous amount of ignorance and of
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:38.400]  course we see Bloomberg has set up with what's the school of journalism
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.560]  Columbia School of Journalism I believe where he's bringing journalists in with
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:48.640]  a bunch of anti-gun panelists to teach them how to report on gun news and it's
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:52.840]  just ridiculous so we have the idiots that are that are the authorized
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:56.280]  journalists but we also have the people that you referred to and I call them
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:02.840]  fourth estate fifth columnist amazing and so where is this going now I mean is
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:08.600]  the media going to keep reporting it like it's real well in this particular
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:13.960]  story I think everybody's going to kind of go silent you go to the ceasefire the
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:18.560]  states United Facebook page and Twitter account things like that they're not
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:22.000]  going to admit this they know they've been caught you're not going to see the
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.880]  media report on this you're not going to see a retraction you're not going to see
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.400]  the Huffington Post come back and say well what if they did break the law big
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.200]  deal they were doing it for a greater good you know it's the David Gregory
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:36.760]  holding up the 30-round magazine where you or I would be facing a world of
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:40.240]  hurt well you know he's doing it for a good cause therefore we can just give
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:44.280]  him a pass sure but I mean to have Bloomberg out quote teaching journalism
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:49.120]  students how to report on gun news how transparent is that and as you said as
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:54.280]  as Dr. Lott said they're gearing up for a major offensive with this information I
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.360]  think their last attempted gun grab backfired on them because it was so
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.040]  blatant what do you think this new attacks going to be and what's the
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:07.760]  latest on Bloomberg trying to finance local races around the country well
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:11.720]  Bloomberg should be no surprise to people I was reporting a couple years ago
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:17.560]  how he was busily going through all of the various states and registering in
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.760]  corporations through all the states to set up exactly the types of efforts that
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:27.320]  he's doing right now all we can really rely on ultimately is that we tell the
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:32.680]  truth now there's obviously a real disparity between the reach of a guy
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:39.400]  like me and the reach of somebody who's got a show on NBC or CBS or CNN or or
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:44.800]  even MSNBC or the New York Times or the Washington Post or the LA Times all
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.360]  that is just a given it's it's the battle space if you will the
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.480]  intellectual or ideological battle space that we have to deal with but we
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:58.200]  continue to tell the truth we continue to reach a critical mass and that critical
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:02.880]  mass continues to educate themselves and continues to be force multipliers
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:08.760]  spread the word because again when we don't have the same reach we rely on
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:14.760]  basically patriotic people not just to be consumers of information sure force
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:18.920]  multipliers and to help propagate it so that this information gets out there and
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:24.840]  ultimately we rely on a critical mass we're gonna say these are not gun laws
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:30.920]  these are intolerable acts we will defy ultimately we will resist but I'm like
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:34.960]  you I'm not a revolutionary I was just saying you know go out on the porch you
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:39.360]  know I have have a nice maduro cigar and a couple fingers of the good stuff in
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:43.840]  the evening and maybe watch you know sons of anarchy on Netflix or something
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:49.880]  like that but these are radicals enslaving us so as men and as humans we
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:53.400]  have an instinct to say no to it and I think they've really miscalculated
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:59.000]  because the awakening is accelerating but they are coming and I as you said
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.440]  David I pray every day they're not stupid enough to try to start a hot war
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:08.480]  with American gun owners because they hate the military they hate police they
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:11.200]  hate the general public they think we're all just gonna kill each other and
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.680]  that's not the way this is gonna go and they'll find out like the Nazis and the
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:20.040]  communists everybody else that we're gonna end up basically tracking them
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:22.800]  down we're gonna have our own Nuremberg trials and they're gonna end up being
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:28.640]  brought to justice they're not going to get away with this yeah and and again I'm
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:33.240]  not gonna start anything with anyone I simply want to leave live my life and
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:38.960]  be left in peace to live my life in freedom and enjoying the blessings of
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:43.520]  liberty which we're supposed to be secured to us and our posterity by the
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.760]  preamble of the Constitution and the laws and the powers that it authorizes

[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:19.680]  us for about 45 minutes to the next hour maybe the whole hour take some phone
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:24.880]  calls he wants to get into the state of the media landscape which I want to talk
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.400]  about that's why I asked him on last week with the report of hundreds of
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:34.760]  newspapers going under thousands preparing to go under broadcast media in
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:39.240]  trouble we're also going to get into Bilderberg that's coming up in the state
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:43.360]  of the police in the community we've got a lot of police news because it's come
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:49.840]  out that the police killed about 400 people in the line of duty last year
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:55.360]  and I really want to flesh this out because when the Washington Post in the
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:55:06.080]  New York Times and CNN and MSNBC a group of media operations a constellation
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:11.120]  that fundamentally want to destroy this country and fundamentally want tyranny
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:16.560]  and fundamentally want to take over for foreign banks to support the screw job
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:22.440]  of Obamacare who support open borders who support taking our guns who support
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.360]  abortion and then they sit up there on their high horse and say the police are
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:30.800]  horrible and the police seem to be federalized and the police are the
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:40.400]  problem you'd have to be an idiot not to know it's a setup and there's nothing I
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.080]  dislike more than third world police or cops that are on power trips and act
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:49.800]  like thugs the problem is that's not what's really happening on average and
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.880]  it's a very evil distortion and there is a plan to cause a civil war in this
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:02.960]  country when they come after the guns and we need to short circuit the whole
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:09.600]  stinking thing and the police seem to do it as well just bashing the police is
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:14.000]  designed to make them go into gang mentality and circle the wagons and then
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:20.320]  close ranks and then the feds are going to come in as their saviors all this
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:24.360]  George Soros stuff is designed to do is to drive the police into the arms of the
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.520]  feds and just can't we be smart enough to see through it can't we be smart
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:34.760]  enough to derail it can't we understand the enemy operation so I'm gonna talk
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:40.520]  about how to reform the police as well and I don't really know Anthony's views
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:46.760]  on this he's a pretty smart guy when he's not you know making sex jokes or
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:51.000]  whatever which I'm not judging fine that's what you're into knock yourselves
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.240]  out it's just an interesting show to go on I like going on it sometimes and
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:57:00.440]  thought why not return the favor come on my show so he's gonna be joining us I
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:03.600]  think he's been on this show before I don't know it all blurs together when
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:10.080]  you do this every day government wipes recent vaccine inquiry data injury data
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.880]  from website big news on info wars.com because it keeps coming out people being
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:17.840]  damaged and having to pay off the people that were brain damaged and the
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:22.360]  vaccines killing people and so now that data had been published on the feds on
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:28.160]  website now they've pulled it that's on info wars.com China's official
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:31.640]  state-run media repeated what they said last week and said they're fearless and
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:37.440]  ready to take the fight to the US Vietnam says that they've got intel that
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.560]  large artillery is being placed on the man-made sandcastles as the Pentagon
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:46.120]  calls them in the South China Sea and that's what this is really about there's
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:50.960]  oil and gas out there Vietnam three years ago claimed it China's already had
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:55.200]  combat with ships and on their border with Vietnam the last year in fact
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:59.920]  Vietnam's basically at war with China right now and it wouldn't be the first
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:03.040]  time they've had a whole bunch of wars with China that's why I was stupid to
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.800]  try to invade Vietnam folks because I mean they just have been fighting for
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:13.520]  couple thousand years anybody tries to take them over and but I digress on that
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:20.400]  subject this is all about getting that oil and gas and quite frankly those
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:25.840]  islands have never belonged to China in fact they're most those islands didn't
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:32.160]  exist before they're making and so it is a very provocative move by China what is
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:35.880]  our government doing arming China every weapon system you can imagine of the
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:39.960]  Sun third hour coming up spread the word

[01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:01.440]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:06.160]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:10.920]  30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we

[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:23.480]  and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:30.760]  we're now into the third hour we have a guest joining us to break down the
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:35.240]  police state Bilderberg coming up here in just a few weeks Rob do it others will
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:42.840]  be in Austria covering it but you see the conniption fit the hysterical
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:46.440]  running around in circles screaming that if government corporations don't
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:50.480]  spy on everything we do and what we eat what books we read and record every one
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:54.240]  of our phone calls that vicious horrible Al Qaeda people will crawl off
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:59.000]  underneath the table and bite us on the feet and I'm thinking a joke about the
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.440]  threat of Islamic terrorism the point is the West is openly funding the whole
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:09.160]  thing now that's been admitted and so you wonder how can they have Marco Rubio
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:14.160]  and John McCain and Obama get up on television and say there is no domestic
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:20.000]  spying it's a conspiracy theory how can you have that when it's known it's going
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:25.160]  on when back when they thought we were all afraid in the New York Times in 2002
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:29.200]  345 they admitted the whole thing portray us just three years ago admitted at
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:33.560]  all clapper gets up and goes we do not collect any doubt a period inside the
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:39.640]  U.S. they want to excuse us because the lie was just so over the top how do they
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:45.720]  do it well this piece aired on Friday's nightly news this is not scripted these
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:51.160]  are not actors my son Rex Jones went out talked about 20 something people this is
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:56.480]  just part one we're gonna show all the people and he went out and every one of
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:00.320]  them didn't know what the TPP was but some would say you're a conspiracy
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:04.560]  theorist because that's what they've heard if someone warns you about
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:08.800]  government corruption it must just be a delusional theory and you look at the
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:12.480]  eyes of these people these are trendies down with the University of Texas they
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:18.160]  don't know how to find their butt with both hands I mean they don't know what
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:23.800]  country they're in what planet they're on here's the clip what do you think the
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:34.120]  TPP is TTP now what a TKP the DPP the what TPP I have no idea nope I have no
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.880]  idea what that is I ain't got a clue I have no idea
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:48.200]  Daniel know what the heck the TPP is no no nobody knows what this is I have no
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:57.880]  idea the toilet paper products the Texas petroleum people the terrorist group
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:06.560]  I don't know and my name is a WWE Thunderstruck roller coaster God bless
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:13.920]  words of wisdom I would honestly have no idea well she it gives the information
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:21.720]  and and into turning well I don't know exactly the words in in in English and
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:27.360]  that's what we call guessing probably some Congress thing about homeless men
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:32.280]  tyrannical people in power actually pretty close actually pretty darn close
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:37.720]  toilet paper the TPP or the Trans Pacific Partnership trans trans what
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:42.600]  Pacific Partnership is a alliance of corporate global businesses that will
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:49.080]  then be able to in any of the three segments Asian Pacific European or
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:54.240]  American will be able to bypass any or all of the laws and rules in that place
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:57.800]  and be able to deal with currency and due process what do you think about that
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:04.120]  reminds me of what China does with their free market zones I would definitely
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:08.680]  have to hear a lot more information because this sounds a lot like a bit of
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:14.080]  conspiracy theory to me I think it sounds a little bit far-fetched I'm
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:20.480]  being totally honest I just don't care right now is that bad like I was just
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:28.640]  so unprepared for this I think that's awesome dude why
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:35.440]  because we need people like that I guess I literally have no clue I've never I've
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:40.960]  been watching news in a while man okay well there you have it he has a watch
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:47.920]  news none of us have we just vote for Obama and pray that he doesn't smite us
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.000]  with his mighty hand of vengeance my first question for you is which party
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.440]  do you support third-party libertarian all right the full reports on info wars
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:04.320]  calm let's talk about the real war on women first wave feminism was a noble
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:09.920]  cause but modern feminists well instead of fighting for say paid and protected
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:16.760]  maternity leave they want to ban words shirts and man-spreading come on that's
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:21.680]  cultural Marxism which asserts that culture and language is responsible for
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:27.000]  oppressing women and not the state the truth is the state encourages gender
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.960]  wars it's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:35.800]  ourselves in fact the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:40.520]  exploit women as the late Aaron Russo revealed the Rockefellers bankrolled
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:44.840]  feminism and not because they had any interest in women's rights but because
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:49.520]  women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta the state collects more tax
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:53.960]  dollars children are indoctrinated at an earlier age and the traditional family

[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:44.480]  on a whole host issues a few weeks ago but obviously as now that we've got him
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:47.600]  other things have been breaking but one of the things I wanted to bring up with
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:52.040]  him is actually in a list of stuff he sent me and that's the lay of the land
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:57.400]  in the media and where things are today and what the media is going to look
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:04.320]  like in the future one thing's for sure there's a lot of new media a lot of it
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:08.720]  is exploding a lot of it is growing some of the old stars of the new media aren't
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:14.640]  as big as they were some are bigger but what we know is dinosaur broadcast TV
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:23.760]  cable TV newspapers are in trouble and it's not just because of the format or
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:28.960]  even the quote competition it's that they won't even compete you turn into
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:35.000]  CNBC or MSNBC and they got big expensive sets and big budgets but it's all
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:40.520]  these political hacks from both parties that have given themselves shows not
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.240]  because they were talented in the media or a good journalist but because they
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:48.520]  were somebody's chief of staff so maybe they can go home and tell mom hey look
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:53.720]  I'm on TV but everybody can be on TV today so it really does come down to
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:59.280]  what is the most informative what is the most interesting who's been the most
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:06.160]  accurate in the past I'll tell you info wars.com prisonplanet.com all of our
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.600]  media systems grow on average at about 30 40 percent a year that's an
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:17.000]  exponential growth curve but then alexa.com a Amazon company and world
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.960]  and daily wrote about this seven months ago and it started just delisted every
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:25.040]  libertarian or conservative side out there and just cut our ratings by 80
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.240]  percent even though Google analytics and all of our systems we showed these side
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:36.560]  by side show us going up they just lowered us and then every socialist fake
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:44.360]  liberal thing was skyrocketed on the same day the same day October 1st 2014 so
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:47.800]  they're gonna play games it's come out that Nielsen has been caught cooking
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.840]  the ratings for MSNBC and CNN it won't matter your sponsors won't get a
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:56.680]  response let me explain something to our enemies suddenly you live in your own
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:03.640]  world our advertisers don't buy advertising off of Arbitron even though
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:09.080]  we're on stations that are you know our Arbitron folks we're on commercial
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:12.760]  stations as well I'm kind of have a leg in both worlds and they don't buy it
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:16.400]  from Nielsen's or other ad agencies we have some ad agency buys but that's
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:21.360]  just because they know about results results is what gets people to
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:26.400]  advertise results there's a reason you're all going bankrupt and or profit
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:31.040]  loss divisions it's because you're like a dead animal people want to just get you
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:35.040]  in the ditch they don't want you in the living room they want to bury you and
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:41.680]  forget you flush you down the toilet like a rotting goldfish so keep it up
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:45.240]  keep lying keep cheating keep doing it that's my view on it we're gonna get
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:49.160]  his take on that Bilderberg the current state of police in the community I want
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:53.600]  to get his take on it I want to talk about what my view is on it and a lot
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:59.280]  more so Anthony of the opening Anthony show Anthony Cumina.com thank you for
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:02.200]  coming on the broadcast today I've thrown a lot of stuff out there you're
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:06.400]  welcome though to just wild card any other subject you want to bring up the
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:12.320]  NSA Rand Paul whatever you want to cover I love it but I think first and
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:16.080]  foremost you should know I am not with the opening Anthony show anymore I knew
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:19.040]  you had your own big show I can't keep track of all this stuff but I was
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:23.800]  summarily dismissed for some tweets that I made back in last July well I
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:27.120]  apologize it just shows I don't pay attention a lot entertainment stuff but
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:29.880]  I like your show because you do cover some serious stuff in fact I've been on
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:35.040]  your show then yes yeah we're on this show and I got to say you know it's
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:38.960]  talking about the media and the state of the media today the fact that years
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:42.280]  ago I've been in broadcasting for a while and when people brought up Alex
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:47.600]  Jones you'd get that oh that guy oh he talks about this and conspiracies and
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:52.760]  and I think the proof is that in the pudding as they say you're a lot of what
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:57.640]  you talked about over the years has absolutely come to fruition and that is
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:03.240]  the results that I think make people go oh so the mainstream media is full of
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:07.960]  crap I do have to go to some of these what people would consider fringe
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:14.480]  broadcasters to actually get the truth and to see people going over to
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:21.800]  alternative type media and news shows is a glimmer of hope I think that we can
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:28.640]  look at because when I watch MSNBC and even Fox who I have a lot of friends
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:33.200]  over there at Fox and I do some of the shows over there every so often but to
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:38.080]  watch that and see what they're shoveling to the public it's disgraceful
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:43.480]  but but this the technology these days allowing a lot of people that in the
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:48.920]  past wouldn't have that opportunity to do a news broadcast and put the truth
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:55.400]  out to people and you've been doing it for years very well I must say is is that
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:58.040]  light at the end of the tunnel I think that we're getting that that maybe
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:03.800]  people maybe people when they're informed and and getting facts and
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:07.440]  actually able to make up their own minds about what they're hearing not based
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:12.680]  on the the the truckload of manure that the that the mainstream media gives us
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:16.960]  there might be hope for the future and I apologize for getting all the shows
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:20.360]  confused I know you've been doing a whole bunch of shows for years in fact you
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:24.480]  were syndicated on terrestrial radio one of the most popular morning shows
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:28.240]  for a long time even given Howard Stern a run for his money but then you ran into
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:34.120]  the FCC and got shut down just like he did what do you think of the FCC and its
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:38.680]  secret plan and power grabbing the internet now well yeah I think they've
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:43.560]  left broadcasting in their wake now they were they were the police of
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:47.600]  broadcasting for quite a while we had run-ins with them a lot of personality
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:53.480]  radio hosts had run-ins with the FCC the the that was the big fear we had oh my
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.280]  god are we gonna get a complaint did we say anything against FCC regulations
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:03.440]  well that's gone the the people that real broadcasters in but they call real
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:11.000]  radio are afraid of now is the public is is the the Twitter's and and Facebook's
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.680]  and Instagram's and things that people will post that say oh my god you've
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.360]  offended people you've said something bad the FCC's a joke now no one breaks the
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:26.080]  FCC rules they don't even file complaints anymore for obscene language and such
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:32.520]  they've gone on to bigger and better things yes the internet we talked about
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:37.880]  net neutrality and how don't worry this is just to keep everything fair whenever
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:43.000]  a government agency jumps in to keep something fair you know you are getting
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:49.160]  screwed and if you think for a second as as with broadcasting initially the FCC
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:55.560]  was brought in to maintain frequencies and power of the stations is the
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:00.160]  transmitter within legal parameters and then all of a sudden they start going
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:04.960]  well maybe we should start looking at content and they should or shouldn't go
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:09.160]  over our airways if people don't think that that's what they'll do with the
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:15.280]  internet they're insane blind and do not see what their whole program has been
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:19.040]  in the past well what about Chris Pratt the actor had to come out and
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:23.240]  apologize because feminist groups complained that the New Jurassic Park
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:28.240]  movie had traditional gender roles and showed a man as a hero I mean I'm sure
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:33.400]  you've noticed every new movie the men are bad the women are the heroes and
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:37.120]  look I don't care if you put women and hero roles Sigourney Weaver whatever
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:41.920]  everybody knows that women and men want to go watch men as action heroes it's
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:45.960]  always been that way so it's this attempt to just muscle in and take over
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:50.240]  reality that doesn't sound liberal to me it sounds the Talitarian and then he
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:56.360]  rolled over and prostrated himself apologizing that he showed a man in a
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:05.040]  good role I mean what planet are we on here the the apology is going to be to
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:11.520]  the to the 2000s 2000 teens is going to be what the hula hoop and pet rock were
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:18.520]  to the 70s and whatnot it we go I hope someday we look back and think how
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:25.040]  ridiculous all of these apologies were when they were happening yes I've seen
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:29.960]  preemptive apologies where someone thinking someone might be offended in
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:35.520]  the future has apologized preemptively yeah I think you're right when a man
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:39.000]  and a woman on a traditional date go to see a film and I think this is the
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  majority of people they want to see traditional values and traditional
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:50.360]  storylines in movies and a small minority is always the squeaky wheel that
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:55.680]  makes people think this is what everyone wants and that's crap it's if we
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.760]  want sure like you brought up Sigourney Weaver that was alien and that was in
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:05.000]  in the late 70s and she was a hero and it was fantastic what a great movie but
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.600]  it doesn't mean that now any time a male is in that dominant role in a movie that
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:17.760]  it's somehow anti-feminism and or misogynistic we're listening these days
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:22.960]  because of social media and the read that everyone has a voice now we are
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:28.600]  listening to the small minority make these decisions and and speaking for
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:32.400]  the majority of people and getting it completely wrong yeah so the tail wagging
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.320]  the dog Anthony Cumia his own show Anthony cumia.com tell us about your
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:40.120]  own broadcast radio that you're doing right now as I know I've heard on the
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:44.560]  radio yeah tell us about that and then tell us what you want to cover when we
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:50.040]  come back it's fantastic I I've never had the freedom I've been broadcasting
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:54.360]  for about 20 years and never had the freedom that I have now on Anthony
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:19:01.360]  cumia.com to cover controversial topics in real language with real guests that
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:06.800]  speak openly and without this fear of repercussions that we all have now we've
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:11.040]  talked about freedom of speech and and you know all the First Amendment is the
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:14.680]  most important thing and and I'm not even talking about government agencies taking
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:19.720]  away our freedom of speech we have the people it's it's the the guy next door
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:23.400]  the person let's talk about that when we come back because that's one of the
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:27.360]  topics that's one of the first topics I want to raise with you is I don't hate
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:31.280]  Muslims I'm not some bigot I get most Muslims aren't radical but there is a
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:37.880]  big segment that basically are like Stone Age you know crazy barbarians I
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:41.800]  mean you know mutilating women but murdering Christians and then we're
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:44.960]  not supposed to be able to draw pictures of Muhammad or they're gonna come
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:50.040]  kill us and now the left says we have to ban free speech to accommodate these
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:54.920]  outsiders that's the inverse of free speech so I want to talk about irreverence
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:20:00.800]  being at the heart of a free society straight ahead so Mark and I we're
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:04.720]  talking about these looters you know in Baltimore and in Ferguson seems like
[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:08.480]  every time there's some kind of an upset the looters come out and I'm thinking to

[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:20.920]  Anthony Kumiya is our guest pioneer in talk radio alternative talk radio shock
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:24.600]  talk I guess you could call it but I've been on multiple shows that he hosts and
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:28.400]  he's a pretty smart guy and I enjoy listening to him when I'm on his show
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:33.280]  or the few times I've heard it on a serious XM because again I'm so busy I
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:36.600]  don't have time to tune into a lot of entertainment media I've really tried to
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:40.600]  direct my crew to do that more because that's where the real battle for hearts
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:44.880]  and minds is happening that's why you turn on the TV and Obama's on almost
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:51.640]  every show now or his wife or Republicans but that's because their
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:56.600]  propaganda isn't as effective as it once was so I believe they're going to use
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:03.080]  violence that people respond to speech with as an excuse to say you better not
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:08.760]  say that or somebody might get violent and that's how they've banned a lot of
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:13.440]  free speech in Europe now I don't support I don't like anti-Muslim
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:18.520]  rallies in Europe you know saying kick all the Muslims out but they shouldn't
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:22.840]  be banned in France and Germany as they've been and it's the same thing I
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:27.560]  don't like people coming to my country telling me I don't have free speech look
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:33.160]  at Saudi Arabia you go there and you say a cuss word or you give somebody a
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:36.720]  playboy or on the other side give somebody a Bible you're gonna get life
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:41.120]  in prison maybe executed there's never any criticism of that by the left
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.360]  Anthony that's another point the so-called left and I'm not left-wing or
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:51.200]  right-wing but but the left seems to be so authoritarian now with all their
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:56.080]  free speech garbage and they never complain about China is banning women
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:01.520]  showing cleavage so they're going to Saudi Arabian around but then meanwhile
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:08.360]  in America a man having any success is somehow inherently something evil it
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:12.520]  really just seems like it's an anti-man thing not about empowering women and
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:16.880]  then why would the political system want to develop something like that yeah
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:21.800]  well just add that to the ever-increasing hypocrisies that we see from the
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:27.240]  left the progressive left which is such a joke now to even call them
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:32.360]  progressive they are more totalitarian than anything right now yeah they have
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:39.080]  really eliminated freedom of speech through fear we don't worry about an
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:44.360]  agency coming by and really taking our freedom of speech that's easy to go and
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:48.240]  make public and and make it look like hey they are infringing on our freedom of
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:53.680]  speech of speech but when we're we're doing it just as people saying you can't
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:57.320]  say that because it's offensive it's racist it's homophobic it's misogynistic
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:03.000]  that's when people get petrified petrified of that scarlet letter which one
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.920]  is it going to be that's slapped on me did I say something bad about transgender
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:13.520]  people did I talk about Muslims did I say something about blacks in Ferguson or
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:18.960]  or Baltimore oh my god look out that's the fear everyone has and it's an
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:23.440]  absolute infringement on your First Amendment right when the fear of ruining
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:28.840]  your reputation losing your job your your family's maybe in danger because of
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:32.800]  it it's happened and and that's what we're looking at it's the new infringement
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:38.720]  on our freedom of speech is this and a bunch of little rats running around
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:44.440]  called the American public we're doing the job that Orwell thought that the
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:49.240]  government would be doing when in sense we're all just ratting on ourselves now
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:53.240]  sure it's like you see these articles every day where the nine-year-old played
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:56.720]  in the park across the street so the child's been taken a neighbor called
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:00.800]  what's the law that your kid can't play in a park well they just call it
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:04.520]  endangerment you know what you're doing I think is the answer no matter what
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:08.480]  somebody's political views are if more of us that are outspoken who support free
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:14.000]  speech start our own podcast our own radio shows then that's the answer to all
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.240]  the control freaks is to battle them with true Americana culture tell folks
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:25.120]  about the system you've launched this is great it's anthony kumbia com it's you
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:30.080]  know unlike what we're seeing here on Skype it's HD video I mean we have a lot
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:35.320]  of guests on the show that not necessarily I don't necessarily agree
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.400]  with you know I had a gun control advocate on the show and we went off
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:46.200]  talking about guns and crime and whatnot but in in open and honest forum
[02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:50.680]  something that is very rare these days and do you think it's a coincidence that
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:54.240]  right when the technology is available for a lot of people to do their own
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:57.720]  broadcasts and get things out there that all of a sudden the government wants to
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:03.120]  start regulating the internet you think that's a coincidence no it's not I mean
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:06.120]  notice we're told get ready for imminent terror attacks right when they're
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:12.520]  trying to reauthorize the Patriot Act exactly a long segments coming up we
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:15.760]  break her in a moment I want to come back and get into where you think the
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:19.440]  media will be in 10 years I mean obviously nobody has a crystal ball and
[02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:22.480]  then I want to shift into a topic I know you talk a lot about and that's the
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:26.920]  police I mean the biggest story in the country month after month is the police
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:30.920]  and so I want to get your take on what you think's behind that and where you
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:34.640]  think that's going as well again ladies and gentlemen you're listening to the

[02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:57.280]  network
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:03.480]  well it looks like the Justice Department wants to ban more Americans
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:09.280]  from owning guns that's right President Barack Hussein Obama is proposing new
[02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:14.280]  firearm regulations that will revoke gun rights from those the government
[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:19.080]  declares to be mentally unfit and that's a scary thought considering the fact
[02:30:19.080 --> 02:30:25.280]  that the official diagnostic system for mental disorders in the US the DSM-5 is
[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:30.960]  so broad that almost every form of human behavior can be diagnosed as some type
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:36.520]  of mental illness for example in 2012 the Department of Veteran Affairs sent
[02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:40.920]  out letters to US military veterans to inform them that their competence
[02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:45.880]  levels were under review if the federal government rated them incompetent they
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:50.040]  would be prohibited from purchasing possessing receiving or transporting a

[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:35.440]  always enjoy talking to folks that were successful in their own right not through
[02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:42.960]  the establishment system look I've got to be honest with you I don't follow Kim
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:47.400]  Kardashian or who or stepdad is I know one of the sisters came out and was
[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:50.680]  worried about geoengineering the other day so when I can get some of these
[02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:58.080]  high-peds to focus on some real issues we love it but I guess their stepdad is
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:04.360]  is like the last white guy to win a triathlon or whatever or or decathlon I
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:10.560]  guess at the Olympics and I remember hearing about his transformation to a
[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:16.360]  woman it's the front page of drudge report calm miss America call me
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:24.080]  Caitlyn and listen I think that Bradley Manning is a hero I guess Chelsea
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:28.040]  Manning now it's good that he exposed war crimes it's good he exposed some of
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:33.320]  the stuff that was going on but at the same time we're supposed to then obsess
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:38.240]  all day over the fact he thinks he's a woman here's all I'm saying why is the
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:42.560]  only story I ever seem to hear about anywhere is men becoming women and I
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:45.680]  understand it's interesting and people like to talk about it I'm doing it right
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:50.720]  now but China is threatening nuclear war with the US and their official daily
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:55.320]  Chinese government newspaper that's up on info wars calm they're building islands
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:35:00.320]  with artillery to stop the ships coming through Obama by executive power has
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:08.880]  just opened the border up with cook numbers we've got zero point two percent growth levels we've
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:15.800]  got just all this craziness going on and you'd think none of that matters in the
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:20.280]  world as Obama prepares executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment that
[02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:25.240]  could cause a civil war and look at this miss America of your TV viewer you can
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:33.080]  click on it and it's these photo shoots and it's some old guy with makeup all
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:36.680]  over him dressed up like a woman I mean at least get a guy that looks like a
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:40.560]  woman if you're gonna put them and make them look like this night I mean this is
[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:46.760]  this is ridiculous now it's a creepy old guy like a woman I mean it's just it's
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:52.360]  just force-feeding weirdness and when I've studied history these people say oh
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:56.240]  you just are a bigot no I personally don't care what somebody does in their
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:36:01.360]  own time it's that I don't like being force-fed constantly this weird one
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:06.720]  agenda the obsession it's gotta be for like five six years because I cover
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:13.840]  media with trainees and transvestites just constantly force-feeding it shoving
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:18.080]  it down my throat pun intended as if it's the only thing in the universe the
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:21.920]  only thing in the world what's behind the agenda and I know I'm kind of
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:25.320]  digressing off what I said we come back with police brutality and that whole
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:28.800]  crisis and where that's going but here are the two big twin stories the police
[02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:35.240]  are evil and the coolest thing to be is it is it is a training or a transvestite
[02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:39.040]  or to totally have your genitals removed and taxpayers will pay for it I
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:42.800]  mean is that what we're going to be known as in the future is not space
[02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:48.240]  exploration not you know inventing a cure for cancer but how cool it is to
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:54.400]  dress up and drag or to take hormones and oh look I'm a woman and then you see
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:57.560]  the women are acting like men the men are acting like women and I mean I'm
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:01.880]  kind of just ranting here just because I don't know what to make of it what do
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:09.360]  you think's happening here Anthony well I see a lot of distractions I see a lot
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:13.400]  of distractions being thrown out there the dumbing down of the American people
[02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:20.640]  through the mass media and this is just a prime example you brought up some very
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:27.200]  important subjects that are happening right now earlier today I saw that there
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:34.560]  was a Russian jet buzzing American ships out at sea and just nothing we don't we
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:38.120]  don't talk about it we don't hear about it we want to hear about yeah the
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:45.800]  Kardashians and and this man woman on I've gotten that sent to me probably 50
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:51.240]  times today that picture and nothing about what the real important issues are
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:56.600]  in in in this country and to the American people and it is a dumbing down I
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:59.960]  think it goes hand-in-hand with what the subject that we were going to talk
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:07.960]  about a virtual police state localized as of yet in a few of these cities which
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:13.200]  I think is kind of a test run I think in Boston with the the Boston bombing at
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:18.120]  the marathon we saw a very successful test run of how the police would be
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:25.240]  greeted with open arms by the people given the right emergency and it is
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:30.880]  dangerous and again all they have to do is sprinkle the news and social media
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:36.520]  takes off with it with some Bruce Jenner as a woman and Kardashians and Nikki
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:41.640]  Minaj and all the rest Kanye and we don't just don't seem to care we just
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:47.680]  sit there and accept it and and watch the the pretty pictures and and do
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:54.640]  nothing about it well I agree with you and it's a complex issue on the police
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:58.960]  on one hand George Soros and others want to make all anger at the government
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:03.760]  be distracted as you said into police themselves we've let the culture get this
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:07.720]  way we let the training get this way we've let society degenerates the police
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:11.800]  get fearful so then they militarize the feds give them all the weapons give them
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:16.120]  the training then when there's problems as Al Sharpton said they want to
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:20.040]  federalize the police as if that's going to make it better and standardize it so
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:25.480]  it's classic Hagellian dialectic a problem reaction solution my point is we
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:30.280]  need to reach out to police take back our communities change it from within not
[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:35.040]  with federalization I really think that some of the people in government do
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:42.280]  want to have some type of moderate slow motion civil war in this country out of
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:48.240]  which they can then bring in the real police state yeah it's more like a chess
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:55.440]  game than this this fast-moving revolution that we say I think people in
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:02.400]  power do think three or four moves ahead and will cause an emergency make it look
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:10.840]  very desperate so that we as the people bang beg them to come in and help us the
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:15.920]  authorities whether it be the police or the federal government never come in and
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:19.840]  say we're gonna take this from you it just it wouldn't happen it's very
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:24.440]  difficult for them to do that because people have this very limited but
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:29.000]  somewhat of an understanding of what some of their rights are so they make a
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:34.120]  problem and then you beg them to come in and help you they're just helping they're
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:37.960]  not taking away your rights they're protecting your freedom and protecting
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:43.880]  your safety so you have to be able to look at how many moves ahead they're
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:48.680]  planning on doing to see what their ultimate goal is and if you talk like
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:54.080]  this too much people say you sound like a nut you sound like your paranoid
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:41:00.520]  about the government but past performance is indeed indicative of future
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:05.080]  what we're going to see them doing in the future it's frightening and it's
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:09.400]  what's more frightening is the lack of awareness that the people have but they
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:14.840]  know Bruce Jenner wants to be a woman and that's easy for them and again my
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:18.920]  issue is there's no need to be teaching my children about Bruce Jenner and how
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:23.960]  to become a woman I mean what is the state doing wanting to be involved with
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:28.520]  our children it's totally creepy it's totally weird and it's my taste it's
[02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:32.800]  not discrimination it's my taste that I'm sick of having a weird creepy man
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:38.040]  with big hands with liver spots all over them with a bunch of people fawning
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:43.360]  combing their hair like it's Marilyn Monroe I'm worried about the elite what
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:49.440]  they put on pedestals I mean it's just it's just bizarre like why didn't they
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:53.200]  get a man that looked like a woman and was at least attractive is what I'm
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:58.080]  getting at why was it something ugly why do they want to there's something there
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:03.040]  it's it's it's twisted I think it's more than just a distraction Alex but what
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:07.600]  you're saying ugly you know it's in the eye of the beholder you're being very
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:14.360]  very negative here and offensive bigoted I'm saying I don't like old men in
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:20.520]  drag okay so bigoted you know you used to be able to raise your children as per
[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:26.280]  your values and your morality now that's some type of crime I gather and
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:32.560]  you're teaching hate if you don't teach this this all-encompassing tolerance
[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:39.520]  that we're all supposed to have your own ethics and morality has no place in your
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:45.800]  child's life it is to be read your child's to be raised by what a society
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:51.840]  deems acceptable now and if it's Bruce Jenner in a dress with makeup on his
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:56.920]  face you have no right telling your kids that that isn't completely fine or
[02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:02.200]  you're just teaching hate well I just wonder what future we're gonna have as
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:09.320]  a country I mean China they chain their kids up by the millions literally when
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:13.400]  they go to work at the big factories there's video and newscasts that show
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:17.160]  this if you're a listener don't believe it just type in China you know children
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:20.600]  chain during work and I'm not saying that's a good thing it's terrible but
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:28.840]  suicide nets a drugging of the workers you know 15 hour workdays how will we
[02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:33.600]  compete with something like that when our gross domestic product is gonna be men
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:42.120]  learning how to put dresses on yeah you know you look back and and again I'll
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:47.400]  I'll be criticized for a waxing fantastic about the good old days but I don't
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:52.120]  know when you look back and look at our achievements in the space program look at
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:58.120]  our achievements when you know we fought in those good wars and the amazing
[02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:03.080]  bravery of our soldiers and the victories we've had all the innovation
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:08.400]  that has come out of this country and the amazing technology that we have
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:13.080]  available to us because of those brilliant minds and and the we used to
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:18.160]  innovate and lead the world now I mean our our flag is not a guy in a dress I
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:23.400]  mean it just isn't the flag of a country we're not seeing any of that anymore I
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:28.300]  don't know what we're doing as a country anymore we have to hitch rides to a
[02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:34.640]  space station that we paid a hell of a lot into Russian rockets on rushing
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:39.200]  rockets because we don't have a program to bring our own astronauts up there
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:43.600]  anymore that's disgraceful and for anyone that says well we got our own
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:46.680]  problems down here if you look at all the innovations that came from the
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:51.400]  American space program at things that we use today the amazing technologies we
[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:56.120]  have that came from the space program it's very it's very but the blinders on
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:00.200]  to think that it's just let's go up there improve where big shots we're not
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:04.640]  doing this anymore and it's showing in our society and in the American
[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:09.440]  civilization that's it I mean I'm tolerant I'm open in fact I hate even
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:12.560]  having to say that because quite frankly I'm paying attention to all this
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:18.560]  weirdness it wants to force its infantile weird mindset into my life and
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:25.440]  then it criticizes any innovation any pro-human I think it's I've got the
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:29.560]  answer we're decadent I don't mean decadent drinking a beer watch football
[02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:32.720]  game folks I mean decadent in that we don't appreciate what we've got we're
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:36.720]  spoiled brats I'm a spoiled brat compared to my dad my kids are somewhat
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:39.960]  spoiled compared to me and my kids are pretty good compared to other ones and
[02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:44.720]  I just realized that we've had it good so long because of the freedom we had in
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:48.880]  this country that we've now gone into a real decadent cycle decadent in Latin
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:55.000]  means to sink in slowly like quicksand and my god I mean it's not the cliche of
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:58.520]  each generation it's done or I don't believe that but because of the smart
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:02.720]  phones the culture of the short attention span the IQs are dropping I
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:06.800]  really think we're going to hit rock bottom very soon Anthony and I'm worried
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:09.440]  about what's gonna happen when we do I mean imagine if we have another great
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:15.040]  depression with the majority of people not knowing how to take care of
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:18.720]  themselves what it will look like with a hundred million people on food
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:25.120]  assistance Anthony I couldn't imagine even years ago I would bring up the I
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:30.040]  couldn't imagine what American refugees would look like streaming over some
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:34.280]  border to find some kind of safety or food or water depending on what the
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:37.960]  emergency was here I just couldn't imagine a line of people complaining that
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:43.560]  their heels hurt or that their suit was dirty or just we don't have this
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:52.640]  instinct to to survive and to innovate and to kind of adapt and overcome a bad
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:57.400]  time like like yes the depression amazing what people had to do with
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:04.040]  families to just live in that time I cannot see these soft American people
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:11.880]  that we see today actually living through something like that and I want to
[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:17.760]  be clear I don't claim to be some tough time I mean my dad's dad and my mom's
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:22.160]  dad were both Army Air Corps guys in World War two they were both really hard
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:27.920]  working they didn't act like tough guys but they were tough guys and my dad's
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:33.560]  dad could do electrical fix the combine fix the well then he could go be in you
[02:47:33.560 --> 02:47:37.760]  know county government on top of that and help poor people and it was just a
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:42.680]  really cool manly man and now I think back to images of my dad's dad and I
[02:47:42.680 --> 02:47:48.680]  look at my dad and then me and I can see the degeneration from him and I think
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:54.960]  oh my god and so much of it is just the way the modern world is has removed us
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:47:59.840]  from the land so we're artificial and I think so many of the people in the
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:04.880]  establishment Anthony are even more artificial than you and I have gotten so
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:08.720]  we at least can see what we've become these people look at us that want to be
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:12.920]  self-sufficient that want to be a little manly and they think we're the problem
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:17.200]  they don't get that that's what built the civilization we see the ghost of what
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:21.240]  we were and wish we were better they see it and think it's a scary ghost
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:28.080]  right it's it's I don't consider myself a tough guy either I mean but I think the
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:32.400]  goal of people that came before us in this country was to make it a little
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:37.520]  easier for the next generation but not so easy to that where literally men
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:42.120]  cannot change a flat tire anymore it's just they can't do it and that's one of
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:46.320]  the most simple things that a man is supposed to be able to do I think again
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:50.440]  the some of some of the technologies that we've gotten of course this little
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:57.120]  gadget has changed the way we live as a society and I think we're certain and
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:02.120]  hollering about how great it is but we don't really we aren't looking in the
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:07.440]  future to see how it's affecting us as people and how we don't really face to
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:12.200]  face talk to each other anymore we don't if something was important to you and
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:15.920]  you wanted to learn more about it you really have to work to go somewhere to
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:20.800]  find that information or learn how to do something now it's intertwined with well
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:24.960]  I'm kind of interested in this but also look there's a man dressed like a woman
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:30.000]  we're back to that again it's distracting this is a great talk you just said it we
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.640]  now have access to more information than anybody ever did before in our fingertips
[02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:38.560]  every library of the world and and now we don't appreciate it because there's
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:42.880]  so much of it it's that paradox so in your gut is it gonna get a lot worse
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:47.560]  before it gets better and are we gonna make it as a species I am so cynical
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:51.840]  when I see what's happening I think it will get a lot worse before it gets
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:56.080]  better if it gets better I think we're on this weird what we're looking at a
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:50:02.320]  time in history where technology such as the smartphones changes civilization
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:07.280]  like those those crossroads at like wow all right we have air travel air travel
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:13.000]  change civilization as we know it this is doing that but we don't know where
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.800]  it's gonna take us but I guarantee you we are not seeing the good old days
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:22.200]  anymore we'll just have to hope the future brings something that's a little
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:25.760]  better than what I'm seeing right now Anthony I got to have you back on more
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:29.200]  because I'm not just saying this kiss in your butt you've really helped me just
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:32.000]  bouncing back and forth crystallize so much what I've been trying to get at I
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:37.260]  just as a guy that's built a company a father three children you know both
[02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:40.600]  sides my family been somewhat successful in business whatever you know just try
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:44.040]  to be a good guy try to build a better world try to make it better for my kids
[02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:48.160]  I see how trying to do everything for my kids has made them kind of spoiled so
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:52.960]  now I'm kind of reversing that but then I look at the whole society and I think
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:59.440]  it's just that we have angst wanting to let folks know and warn people that we
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:03.600]  are to fork in the road that we kind of were choosing our own adventure right
[02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:07.840]  now and that some of these roads lead somewhere really scary that's a normal
[02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:12.480]  instinct to want to know how the world works to want to be involved to want to
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:17.200]  have your own freedom to want to stop special interests that are totalitarian
[02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:22.360]  and they've conditioned the public that that's bad or evil to have a survival
[02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:26.160]  instinct and so I think really the world split into two different groups of
[02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:28.920]  people are three different those that want to build a better world want to
[02:51:28.920 --> 02:51:32.680]  know how it works want to inform others those that are lazy and don't care and
[02:51:32.680 --> 02:51:36.520]  those that actually know what's going on but want to feed on the giant dumb
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:42.600]  mass and so I think the battle is in between those three groups and sometimes
[02:51:42.600 --> 02:51:46.840]  I think the giant mass of dumb down idiots is more dangerous than even the
[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:51.160]  elite because we study history giant herds of dumb down people are
[02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:55.400]  incredibly dangerous and are uncontrollable I think the establishment
[02:51:55.400 --> 02:52:00.480]  with their social engineering and stuff has taken the easiest path but I think
[02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:06.840]  down the road it's the worst path we have absolutely you just have to glance
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:11.120]  back through history you don't even have to go very far to see a dumb down
[02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:17.480]  public that is a bit desperate is extremely dangerous to the entire world
[02:52:17.480 --> 02:52:22.360]  and I think that's what we're saying as far as information goes it's very
[02:52:22.360 --> 02:52:28.040]  difficult to weed out accurate information these days and I think the
[02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:33.880]  powers that be enjoy that they take advantage of it love it the distractions
[02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:38.160]  that are available when you're going to look for information is akin to try
[02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:42.800]  sitting in a library and studying something while there's clowns juggling
[02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:48.480]  and music playing and talking and and freak shows going on it would be very
[02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:53.280]  difficult but that's virtually what we're doing it's very hard to say how
[02:52:53.280 --> 02:52:57.480]  many times have you tried to look something up and gone off on a tangent
[02:52:57.480 --> 02:53:01.960]  because other links are popping up or you know somebody calls you or text you
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:06.840]  with something with it's very hard to concentrate sure our brains have been
[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:12.960]  rewired I mean our brains have been rewired yeah rewired and the lack of
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:18.840]  attention span that we have today the lack of just an interest in any one
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:23.960]  thing we have to we have to be all over the place 24 hours a day instead of
[02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:29.120]  really just settling in and looking at something studying it becoming
[02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:34.960]  knowledgeable about a subject it that that's gone it's gone
[02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:41.320]  Mr. Cumia the bit of very informative interview very thought-provoking love
[02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:45.320]  it Alex I tell folks again when your different podcasts and radio shows air
[02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:51.600]  how folks find those it's easy just go to anthonycumia.com we're live every day
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:54:01.400]  4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on the East Coast and again open honest funny provocative just
[02:54:01.400 --> 02:54:08.040]  free it's it's freedom finally able to voice opinions and yeah people will get
[02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:11.600]  mad but at least I don't have to worry that my boss is gonna throw me out the
[02:54:11.600 --> 02:54:15.240]  door well that's what is gonna be the great equalizer that's what they want
[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:18.640]  to censor the web and shut us down now because people gotten a taste for real
[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:23.560]  freedom which isn't left or right it's it's just common sense and people are
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:26.720]  going away you mean there's shows that aren't left or right they're just common
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:32.680]  sense and then their interactive they resonate with it and it's it's really
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:36.080]  part of the big battle that we're having right now thank you so much for the
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:41.960]  time well that was a really good interview very informative and look it
[02:54:41.960 --> 02:54:48.600]  comes down to this as a culture as a society you would have to have a lobotomy
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:52.680]  to not know we're in big trouble and there are a thousand different
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:56.480]  distractions out there and a lot of times I'll take distractions and cover
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:00.200]  them because I can get folks they're distracted to tune into the show to
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:03.800]  actually hear about the real issues but let me explain something the social
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:07.240]  engineers and they've written countless books that we've quoted here on air
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:12.680]  admit that they're distracting us and dumbing us down and admit they have a
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:17.640]  larger plan to take control of society and that they want humanity basically out
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:24.640]  of the ballgame with a decision-making process and all I'm saying is we should
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:31.720]  want to be in the ball game and people think that means a bunch of work my life
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:37.880]  is so much more fulfilled so much more dynamic than when I was just a high
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:42.800]  school student wanting to get decent grades and pick up cheerleaders and it
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:48.640]  wasn't bad but if I had a great you know life growing up it was just that once
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:52.800]  you really realize there's a battle for the future of humanity we're designed
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:55.960]  to be part of that battle we're designed to try to build good communities
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:59.800]  we're designed to try to mentor young people we're designed to try to teach
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:04.800]  people what we've learned we're designed to learn from our elders as well and
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:09.640]  instead we just euthanize our elders and don't give our veterans health care and
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:14.520]  abort our babies and and yeah there's arguments you know for all of that out
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:19.680]  there but the arguments are frauds and the elite don't live the way they want
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:26.920]  us to live the elite have been so decadent so long they're disconnected
[02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:32.480]  from reality and they're dangerous now before we in this hour we're gonna have
[02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:36.600]  a lot of the breaking news boiled down tonight on the nightly news but it all
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:39.480]  comes down to the fact that they want to control our lives look at this article
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:44.040]  out of EAG news West Virginia teacher threatened with fine for violating
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:49.640]  Michelle O's school lunch snack rules they want to tell us how much vitamin C
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:52.640]  we should get they want to tell us how much fat we should get they want to
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:57.720]  tell us that GMO is okay no it's not and that's why we try to fund this
[02:56:57.720 --> 02:57:01.200]  operation with high-quality water filters at the lowest price to cut out
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:04.840]  fluoride glyphosate and hundreds of other deadly chemicals that's why an
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:09.180]  info or store.com we're running all these different specials on the
[02:57:09.180 --> 02:57:16.800]  nutraceuticals survival shield nasin iodine x2 a true game changer because
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:20.320]  it's the deep earth crystal source of the pure halogen that blocks the bad
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:25.760]  halogens I mean just try it for yourself folks you will detox though I
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:29.320]  consult your physician this is not a game this is a big game changer
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:33.120]  unfortunately we did we developed the last two years a new source of this deep
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:37.640]  earth crystals and it's very hard to procure we're selling out of the
[02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:41.360]  supplies we have we have one more batch getting made that's smaller right now
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:44.760]  we're basically sold out of the current batch we've got a little bit left if you
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:49.680]  go to info wars store.com or info wars life.com you can find the survival
[02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:53.440]  shield x2 nasin iodine and when it sells out which it will will still have the
[02:57:53.440 --> 02:57:57.040]  original and I believe we'll be able to get more of the deep earth crystals but
[02:57:57.040 --> 02:58:01.080]  I told you the story two years ago about how they tried to stop us getting our
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:05.640]  other really clean form that's from the ocean and trying to stop us getting that
[02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:08.800]  we found this source and did the research and found out how it was even
[02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:17.280]  better in my view so info wars life.com or 888-2533139 we have big discounts
[02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:21.040]  going on two packs five packs and ten packs this stuff stores for a long time
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:25.400]  so if I was you I was stockpilot it's that big of a game changer and it helps
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:32.600]  fund the info wars operation so info wars life.com or 888-2533139 and we'll
