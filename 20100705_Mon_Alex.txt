[00:00:04.907 --> 00:00:07.849]  It's been 234 years since this republic was established.
[00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:47.245]  The United States has had its birthday and scores of mainstream newspapers are saying it could be our last.
[00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:52.909]  So the establishment is now basically trying to demoralize the United States.
[00:00:52.909 --> 00:01:05.396]  They have denied that they've been dismantling the country for decades, when every move they've made has been to do just that, and when all of their internal globalist publications admit that that is their goal.
[00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:14.472]  Why now are they all over the news saying the United States is in peril?
[00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:20.814]  US, British, Canadian newspapers all basically saying the same thing.
[00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:24.435]  Why has the green light been given to report on this?
[00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:34.799]  11 years ago, we began to beat the drum about derivatives and how they were counterfeit fraud being sold to government and individuals and how they were designed to implode the economy.
[00:01:36.274 --> 00:01:47.382]  To be under the loan sharking control of the very so-called banks, or the criminal class of fraudsters, is really the proper term for them.
[00:01:47.382 --> 00:01:55.047]  And then I saw in 2007, they started admitting it was deadly and going to implode, but not saying it was fraud.
[00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:59.890]  Because they were getting ready for the solution to the problem they had created.
[00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.553]  They were getting ready to introduce the solution
[00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.551]  To the crisis they had engineered.
[00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:17.214]  Here is CNBC today, Dow repeats great depression pattern charts show.
[00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:25.437]  That's CNBC, Dow repeats depression charts.
[00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:27.818]  Amazing, here's another headline.
[00:02:27.818 --> 00:02:28.858]  With the U.S.
[00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:33.100]  trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[00:02:35.373 --> 00:02:39.074]  That is the London Telegraph.
[00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:42.675]  And these type of headlines go on and on and on.
[00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:46.396]  We're going to read over these articles coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:48.937]  But think about that headline from CNBC.
[00:02:48.937 --> 00:02:53.878]  Dow repeats Great Depression pattern the charts show.
[00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:05.115]  Look at this headline out of the Globe and Mail, one of the big papers in Canada.
[00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:08.856]  Happy 4th of July, America needs it.
[00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:18.019]  The great republic is in a perilous state politically and economically.
[00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:26.982]  I've got article after article like that in front of me without even looking.
[00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:28.983]  Without even looking this morning.
[00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.072]  This information is all over the map.
[00:03:34.072 --> 00:03:41.537]  I will guarantee you that if I get my great crew in there to go search these type terms we're seeing, we will see a concerted pattern.
[00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:54.646]  In fact, I heard on the radio, I was listening to music on XM, driving with my wife, and so we were listening to some 80s music,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:07.089]  And the fella came on yesterday and said, Happy Fourth of July, unless you don't want to celebrate it like some people don't want to because of what's going on and where our country's going.
[00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.071]  And I was like, excuse me?
[00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:16.537]  Now, DJs on 80 stations are making bizarre, cryptic comments.
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:31.352]  Or perhaps the country is on the verge of total revolution against this offshore takeover and people are just sick and tired of going along and so they're just spontaneously speaking out.
[00:04:31.352 --> 00:04:34.775]  Could this be like Romania and what happened with Ceausescu?
[00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:35.195]  I don't know.
[00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:38.119]  We need to debate this today.
[00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:41.602]  We don't have any guests lined up because I wanted to be able to open the phones up throughout the broadcast.
[00:04:41.602 --> 00:04:42.843]  They're not open yet.
[00:04:42.843 --> 00:04:50.128]  I want to tell you some of the subjects I'd like to hear from you on and get into the economy, the oil spill, the Iran situation.
[00:04:50.128 --> 00:04:55.611]  An incredible stack of Big Brother news here in front of me and CPS news.
[00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:57.032]  That's all coming out worldwide.
[00:04:57.032 --> 00:04:58.894]  They do have quotas to take your children.
[00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.450]  Listen up, folks.
[00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.391]  This is important.
[00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:02.512]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:10.857]  Now you can get free shipping on the storable, easy-to-fix, delicious food from efoodsdirect.com from July 4th through July 14th.
[00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:16.681]  We have looming evacuations in the Southeast, unemployment insurance running out, and predictions of huge inflation.
[00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:18.682]  So we all need to get as much food as we can.
[00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:22.163]  Every one of you needs to buy as much storable food as possible.
[00:05:22.163 --> 00:05:27.344]  This is the perfect time to do just that with eFoodsDirect and take advantage of their free shipping special.
[00:05:27.344 --> 00:05:37.506]  When you order from eFoodsDirect.com from July 4th through July 14th, every dollar you spend will buy the food and eFoodsDirect will pay for the shipping in the continental United States.
[00:05:37.506 --> 00:05:39.707]  This is Alex Jones wishing you and your family
[00:05:39.987 --> 00:05:43.609]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:06:04.377 --> 00:06:05.378]  What have we got?
[00:06:05.378 --> 00:06:07.520]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.485]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:13.747]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:15.769]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:17.451]  So they think they own our land?
[00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:18.772]  They think they own our water?
[00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:19.393]  Children?
[00:06:19.393 --> 00:06:20.494]  Our education?
[00:06:20.494 --> 00:06:21.335]  Our money?
[00:06:21.335 --> 00:06:24.999]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:30.324]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:31.345]  We have the facts.
[00:06:31.345 --> 00:06:32.506]  We have the Constitution.
[00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:33.407]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:06:33.407 --> 00:06:34.308]  We have common law.
[00:06:34.308 --> 00:06:36.830]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.594]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:06:40.694 --> 00:06:45.659]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.161]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:48.242]  Don't tread on me.
[00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:55.109]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.

[00:07:56.298 --> 00:07:58.039]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:13.467]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:16.888]  Every morning I get up, I can even get up at 5 a.m.
[00:08:16.888 --> 00:08:26.512]  and Paul Watson's already updated PrisonPlanet.com because he's updating from the UK where he lives, and I'm always amazed by the headlines.
[00:08:26.512 --> 00:08:27.012]  Even though
[00:08:28.456 --> 00:08:32.430]  I spend many hours every day reading newspapers, reading legislation.
[00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:40.874]  Going over government and industry white papers to study what the globalists are saying, thinking, and doing.
[00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:45.795]  I am still amazed that this is really happening.
[00:08:45.795 --> 00:08:54.058]  It is July 5th, 2010, the day after our birthday here in the United States for our Republic.
[00:08:54.058 --> 00:09:00.001]  The mainstream media all over the world is saying the United States is in peril of completely collapsing.
[00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:07.987]  We have to ask ourselves, why is the media starting to tell the truth?
[00:09:07.987 --> 00:09:10.810]  That's an important question, isn't it?
[00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.971]  And what are the ramifications of a collapse?
[00:09:12.971 --> 00:09:14.373]  What does a collapse mean?
[00:09:18.803 --> 00:09:23.166]  I'll go over that today, but just look at these headlines at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:27.549]  TSA to block websites with controversial opinions.
[00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:36.815]  And the article goes over how InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are already being censored by governments around the world.
[00:09:36.815 --> 00:09:41.438]  Here's another one, SpyTech that monitors conversations being launched in Europe report.
[00:09:43.095 --> 00:09:48.737]  And this is all over the European newspapers and raw stories reporting on it here.
[00:09:48.737 --> 00:10:03.581]  But if you go back to my film, Police State 2000, that I released in 2000, but that we shot in 1999, I have the Austin American statesman in there.
[00:10:03.581 --> 00:10:10.943]  And it says, oh, the Austin police are putting up anti
[00:10:13.806 --> 00:10:23.134]  Gunshot systems, where they can pick up gunshots and then triangulate the location.
[00:10:23.134 --> 00:10:39.408]  And so I went to a search engine and researched it and found out that it was a federal grant, that Kay Belly Hutchinson, the Senator, had bragged about getting us the money for it, and that it had been put in in every major city in the country, and that it was not an anti-crime device.
[00:10:39.408 --> 00:10:41.110]  It was not a gunshot detector.
[00:10:42.253 --> 00:11:05.471]  But that it indeed was a system with shotgun microphones to listen to people at up to 200 yards away and that they were using computer software, keyword software, the same stuff the NSA has used for 30 years with keyword echelon systems, to record basically everything and then have computers analyze it and flag it.
[00:11:09.738 --> 00:11:19.026]  And I'm gonna cover this more today, but the big issue is that's how illegitimate and how creeping and how criminal this government is.
[00:11:19.026 --> 00:11:21.368]  All these governments, the same system worldwide.
[00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:22.889]  It's a global corporate government.
[00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:25.171]  They've taken over almost every nation in the world.
[00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:32.037]  They've jacked up our taxes, paid themselves our tax money, used our militaries to back up their takeover of third world nations.
[00:11:32.037 --> 00:11:35.680]  Then the United States, England, and Europe get our name demonized.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.141]  We then get the blame.
[00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:38.082]  We collapse.
[00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:44.222]  A open world government is founded, basically run by the third world countries.
[00:11:44.222 --> 00:11:54.805]  And by run, that's in quotes, the globalists will just have them vote in a puppet security council system and call for sanctions on the West and the rest of it.
[00:11:54.805 --> 00:12:00.986]  But the third world armies in the next phase will be used as the muscle to come in here and police the West.
[00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:02.547]  It's all been figured out.
[00:12:02.547 --> 00:12:06.568]  They play every different side against each other and the globalists sit offshore
[00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:22.929]  Basically in the symphony of destruction and manipulation, but it was so frustrating to go do the research and read about the company that had gotten the contracts all over the United States and how they bragged that, oh, not only is it a gunshot triangulator,
[00:12:24.572 --> 00:12:39.635]  But yes, this can be routed into software to pick up violent sounding words, agitated tone, and then it's a form of pre-crime and the police are dispatched.
[00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:41.575]  But that itself is a cover.
[00:12:41.575 --> 00:12:43.015]  They're not concerned about crime.
[00:12:43.015 --> 00:12:46.336]  In fact, they love it because then you beg for more police and more control.
[00:12:46.336 --> 00:12:50.977]  It's about the NSA listening to you even when you're on the street.
[00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:56.982]  Have you ever read 1984 by Eric Blair, pen name George Orwell?
[00:12:56.982 --> 00:13:12.525]  He runs off to meet with this woman, because it's illegal to have a girlfriend outside of government authorization, and they meet in a park.
[00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.486]  And the fact that he is
[00:13:17.091 --> 00:13:20.173]  Not trying to overthrow the state, that's an even bigger crime.
[00:13:20.173 --> 00:13:25.918]  It's just the fact that he wants to be an individual and maybe have a little privacy.
[00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:35.305]  There's a camera in the bathroom, a camera in the bedroom, there's microphones everywhere, and so they go to this park and then they notice that there's some woods a few hundred yards away, so they
[00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:41.896]  They go off and they hide in the woods and they make love under some trees.
[00:13:41.896 --> 00:13:43.517]  And of course, it's all videotaped.
[00:13:43.517 --> 00:13:53.160]  It's all recorded because Big Brother puts the cameras and microphones by design in the most remote areas.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:14:02.544]  And I remember a decade ago as well, not just reading about the microphones being put up all over the United States by the Pentagon, but that we paid for.
[00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:11.973]  And then lying to the public whenever they would ask about them and saying, oh, those are gunshot detectors.
[00:14:11.973 --> 00:14:15.573]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:14:15.573 --> 00:14:25.455]  But I remember reading about billions of dollars, $2 billion, Homeland Security funding eight years ago for New York for cameras and microphones and $3 billion for Boston.
[00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:33.237]  But even before that, billions of dollars for the most remote areas of Iowa and
[00:14:34.588 --> 00:14:48.756]  Colorado, Texas, and Utah, where they put up cameras and microphones, but also little wire rails that may go dozens of miles, one report said.
[00:14:48.756 --> 00:14:54.879]  And they have these in some of the parkland around San Francisco, some of the state and federal parks.
[00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:59.662]  And these little robots buzz back and forth on the wires and then
[00:15:02.213 --> 00:15:10.979]  Periodically stop and recharge at solar charging systems and then continue on listening to what you're doing in the woods.
[00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:17.444]  And the spin was, we want to catch people dumping things in the national parks and state parks and city parks.
[00:15:17.444 --> 00:15:21.207]  And of course I went and researched the program more using search engine terms.
[00:15:21.207 --> 00:15:25.069]  That's all Google is, is an NSA search, but it allows you to use it at a limited level.
[00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:36.980]  And using their own technology, I went and looked it up, and of course, it is to see what you're saying when you're in the woods.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:52.754]  I was, Saturday, I watched a Firefox, the old Clint Eastwood movie from the late 70s, where he's a US spy sent to Russia to steal the high-tech stealth aircraft.
[00:15:54.113 --> 00:15:56.014]  Of course, that was all science fiction in that movie.
[00:15:56.014 --> 00:16:01.758]  Of course, it turns out the Russians and the US had already developed stealth, had it for a decade before that movie was even made.
[00:16:01.758 --> 00:16:03.318]  See, it's all conditioning.
[00:16:03.318 --> 00:16:17.367]  Kind of like they have the new hit movie this weekend, Salt, with CFR member Angelina Jolie, to come out six days at the peak cycle, right on the 4th of July, two days before the 4th of July,
[00:16:18.817 --> 00:16:23.538]  Right when there was a national news story about sexy Russian spies.
[00:16:23.538 --> 00:16:25.978]  See how everything's conditioned and pre-programmed?
[00:16:25.978 --> 00:16:27.319]  And they admit now the movies.
[00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:28.719]  They call it behavior placement.
[00:16:28.719 --> 00:16:30.779]  For a decade I've called it propaganda placement.
[00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:32.640]  They now have called it behavior placement.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.480]  And they admit that everything is basically government programming.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.821]  Almost every show.
[00:16:36.821 --> 00:16:43.142]  Every national radio program is put out by the big syndicators.
[00:16:43.142 --> 00:16:44.362]  Everything is engineered.
[00:16:47.262 --> 00:16:47.482]  I think?
[00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.511]  There's no way they can all be fired or censured.
[00:17:08.511 --> 00:17:10.333]  And the word is that's already starting.
[00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:14.335]  That's why you're hearing more and more national hosts admit the government stage is terror.
[00:17:14.335 --> 00:17:18.138]  You're hearing top Republicans come out and say the majority of Republicans are against war.
[00:17:18.138 --> 00:17:18.899]  It's a fraud.
[00:17:18.899 --> 00:17:28.685]  I even heard beyond the beltway last night admitting maybe we should decriminalize drugs because, you know, it's corrupting police and corrupting the population.
[00:17:28.685 --> 00:17:33.028]  More and more people are figuring out that they better tell the truth.
[00:17:33.028 --> 00:17:35.010]  They better speak out or it's over.
[00:17:38.345 --> 00:17:40.146]  You can't just take the middle road here.
[00:17:40.146 --> 00:17:49.413]  You can't just sit on the sidelines and think that you're gonna be unscathed.
[00:17:49.413 --> 00:17:51.835]  That is the worst position to be in right now.
[00:17:51.835 --> 00:18:02.923]  But going back to Firefox, this is how I can't watch movies, I can't read the newspaper, I can't see somebody playing a video game, or I'll be at a coffee shop and hear people regurgitating the propaganda.
[00:18:02.923 --> 00:18:03.904]  So everywhere,
[00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:07.711]  When you're aware of this information, you see it.
[00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:21.623]  So I'm watching Firefox and there's that stealth propaganda conditioning many years before, in fact, almost nine years before they announced stealth technology.
[00:18:21.623 --> 00:18:27.568]  There they are describing the stealth technology in great detail and now it's declassified.
[00:18:27.568 --> 00:18:32.533]  Again, they had it a decade before they made the movie in the United States and to some extent in Russia.
[00:18:37.191 --> 00:18:43.193]  And he's going through Russian customs as an American businessman.
[00:18:43.193 --> 00:18:49.014]  That's his cover, Clint Eastwood infiltrating.
[00:18:49.014 --> 00:18:58.337]  And the movie even admits the cover he's using is a opium trafficker, and that the Russians are involved in that with him, so they basically let him slip in.
[00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:03.138]  So there you have the movie admitting that the government ships in the narcotics.
[00:19:03.138 --> 00:19:04.799]  So it's all about throwing it in your face.
[00:19:06.189 --> 00:19:10.752]  Because they know the subconscious mind is much more powerful than the conscious mind, so they're preconditioning you.
[00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:16.815]  And he goes through a checkpoint and they search his bags, and then they ask him questions and he gets mad and says, how dare you?
[00:19:16.815 --> 00:19:18.316]  This has never been done to me before.
[00:19:18.316 --> 00:19:21.818]  And it's shocking in the movie that he's showing his papers.
[00:19:21.818 --> 00:19:25.781]  And it's shocking that he's having his bags searched.
[00:19:25.781 --> 00:19:27.241]  And what was that?
[00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:27.722]  30 years ago?
[00:19:27.722 --> 00:19:31.324]  30 years ago that movie came out?
[00:19:33.243 --> 00:19:47.569]  And now you look at what a Hollywood rendition of what a total police state looks like, and it's America!
[00:19:47.569 --> 00:19:54.212]  We're gonna come back and I'm gonna get into some devastating information.
[00:19:54.212 --> 00:19:56.713]  And then I've got an important question to ask all of you out there.
[00:19:56.713 --> 00:19:57.193]  Stay with us.
[00:19:57.193 --> 00:19:57.953]  We're live.
[00:19:57.953 --> 00:19:58.273]  July 5th, 2010.
[00:20:01.192 --> 00:20:04.953]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:06.274]  Think again!
[00:20:06.274 --> 00:20:13.917]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[00:20:13.917 --> 00:20:21.159]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:26.541]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.
[00:20:26.741 --> 00:20:29.703]  On how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[00:21:05.476 --> 00:21:07.257]  Genetically modifying.
[00:21:07.257 --> 00:21:09.719]  Mixing vegetables with animals.
[00:21:09.719 --> 00:21:12.642]  And now experimenting with viruses.
[00:21:12.642 --> 00:21:13.663]  Viruses.
[00:21:13.663 --> 00:21:19.408]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:21:19.408 --> 00:21:21.590]  Starve or surrender.
[00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.370]  Surrender.
[00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.174]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:21:26.174 --> 00:21:27.054]  What then?
[00:21:29.795 --> 00:21:32.856]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:37.198]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:21:37.198 --> 00:21:40.059]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[00:21:59.935 --> 00:22:09.957]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:09.957 --> 00:22:16.398]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:16.398 --> 00:22:25.240]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:34.826]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:34.826 --> 00:22:39.428]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[00:22:39.428 --> 00:22:41.229]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:43.731]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:22:44.011 --> 00:22:47.332]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:51.513]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[00:22:51.513 --> 00:22:55.074]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.074 --> 00:23:00.055]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.055 --> 00:23:05.277]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[00:23:05.277 --> 00:23:05.977]  Listen.
[00:23:05.977 --> 00:23:10.258]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:23:10.258 --> 00:23:13.239]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:16.695]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:20.476]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[00:23:20.476 --> 00:23:28.901]  Heart and Body Extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[00:23:28.901 --> 00:23:31.442]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[00:23:31.442 --> 00:23:35.804]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[00:23:36.004 --> 00:23:36.284]  Day after day
[00:24:07.276 --> 00:24:15.662]  Alright, we're getting close to 80 days into the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:24:36.024 --> 00:24:41.446]  Clearly it is a false flag operation any way you look at it.
[00:24:41.446 --> 00:24:44.247]  I'm going to recap that coming up at about 40 after.
[00:24:44.247 --> 00:24:59.291]  We do have a member of the Council on Foreign Relations in the Washington Post talking about 20 million people being forcibly evacuated.
[00:24:59.291 --> 00:25:01.352]  The official number is over 150 million gallons.
[00:25:04.719 --> 00:25:05.160]  of course.
[00:25:23.736 --> 00:25:36.382]  Still is sending now more of the oil towards Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, and the currents are now beginning to bring the largest areas of the slick.
[00:25:36.382 --> 00:25:42.265]  Tens of thousands of square miles of it directly at the Florida Keys.
[00:25:42.265 --> 00:25:43.626]  And still Obama
[00:25:45.165 --> 00:25:48.129]  70 plus days into this is blocking ships.
[00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:54.479]  Last week they said, well, we'll start looking at a procedure to down the road allow ships.
[00:25:54.479 --> 00:25:58.185]  Yes, we're going to allow it after we bureaucratically sit on it.
[00:25:59.022 --> 00:26:00.703]  That's a policy the Japanese have.
[00:26:00.703 --> 00:26:12.212]  They'll accept your goods, your produce or your seafood, but then the inspectors don't show up and it rots or basically becomes putrid on the dock.
[00:26:12.212 --> 00:26:17.396]  It's kind of the big mafia union mode of a sabotaging industry and society.
[00:26:17.396 --> 00:26:19.798]  The United States has been sucked dry.
[00:26:19.798 --> 00:26:26.844]  The goal is to run up our debts and then bankrupt us, and then we will implode into the loan sharks grasp.
[00:26:28.135 --> 00:26:39.802]  And so we're getting all these reports of soldiers starting to move families away from the Gulf Coast.
[00:26:39.802 --> 00:26:45.385]  I want to open the phones up specifically for soldiers or police.
[00:26:46.619 --> 00:27:12.914]  Or people that are involved in the bureaucratic planning, civilian sectors of this, specifically, then we'll have open phones after that for everybody, specifically for people who are working in the relief effort or who are working in the government for your specific intel on plans for forced evacuations of the Gulf area.
[00:27:14.158 --> 00:27:22.984]  Now, we saw reports a month and a half ago that 40 million were going to be evacuated and that they were being evacuated.
[00:27:22.984 --> 00:27:27.447]  That, I guess, came from rumors that there was talk of evacuation.
[00:27:27.447 --> 00:27:32.030]  Now, the fact that there are discussing forced evacuations, that's now confirmed.
[00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:38.414]  But you notice that it kind of discredited the original reports because people were saying that the evacuations had begun.
[00:27:38.414 --> 00:27:40.335]  And that is not the case.
[00:27:40.335 --> 00:27:43.798]  But clearly, a atmosphere of martial law exists
[00:27:44.518 --> 00:27:55.950]  Uh, in the areas of the Gulf affected where private BP contractors, or anyone with a BP lanyard for that matter, can order the police around.
[00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.552]  PBS is reporting on this today.
[00:27:57.552 --> 00:28:00.235]  It's happened to their reporters, Frontline specifically.
[00:28:02.961 --> 00:28:03.502]  I don't know.
[00:28:18.641 --> 00:28:21.822]  Because BP will put out a APB.
[00:28:21.822 --> 00:28:22.982]  This is the corporate governance.
[00:28:22.982 --> 00:28:36.425]  They're just training us and drilling us to have foreign troops, to have mercenaries, to have private contractors, to have the clergy quietly on FEMA payroll, teaching her flock to submit to tyranny.
[00:28:36.425 --> 00:28:39.045]  This has all been pre-planned, you notice.
[00:28:39.045 --> 00:28:40.645]  Katrina was a drill, a test.
[00:28:40.645 --> 00:28:43.366]  They used that to see if the troops would confiscate
[00:28:44.716 --> 00:28:47.918]  Guns as they were ordered to and they did pass the test.
[00:28:47.918 --> 00:28:49.199]  They did it.
[00:28:49.199 --> 00:28:56.383]  And so you can see the SPP, North American Union, where the corporate chiefs are giving the government officials orders in the meetings.
[00:28:56.383 --> 00:29:00.145]  You see this in every case.
[00:29:00.145 --> 00:29:04.928]  And so it is confirmed.
[00:29:04.928 --> 00:29:07.410]  Breaking news, military men moving their families.
[00:29:08.627 --> 00:29:14.789]  Snow plows ready to remove abandoned vehicles from highways when evacuation occurs.
[00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:19.570]  This is from before it's news.
[00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:23.571]  Snow plows ready to remove abandoned vehicles from highways when evacuations occur.
[00:29:23.571 --> 00:29:30.513]  It's been approximately three weeks since the State Trooper Secret Service appointee Greg Everson appeared.
[00:29:30.513 --> 00:29:31.853]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:45.630]  Now, they do have regular evacuation plans for hurricanes, they do have evacuation routes, and they do have these emergency plans already in place.
[00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:50.435]  So we have to look at this and study it, but also not get overly panicked by it.
[00:29:50.435 --> 00:29:54.360]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.023]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:04.047]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:30:04.047 --> 00:30:10.452]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:30:10.452 --> 00:30:17.838]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:17.838 --> 00:30:22.721]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:24.863]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:30:31.374 --> 00:30:35.103]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:30:35.635 --> 00:30:42.401]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:30:42.401 --> 00:30:46.285]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:30:46.285 --> 00:30:52.671]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:30:52.671 --> 00:30:53.872]  Thank you.
[00:31:01.479 --> 00:31:05.440]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:14.302]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:31:14.302 --> 00:31:18.923]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:31:18.923 --> 00:31:29.745]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:31:30.385 --> 00:31:39.887]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:39.887 --> 00:31:45.329]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:31:45.329 --> 00:31:52.810]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.571]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:31:59.363 --> 00:32:03.906]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:32:03.906 --> 00:32:04.826]  Number one.
[00:32:04.826 --> 00:32:08.249]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.249 --> 00:32:09.109]  Number two.
[00:32:09.109 --> 00:32:13.992]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:13.992 --> 00:32:14.753]  It's true.
[00:32:14.753 --> 00:32:19.616]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.616 --> 00:32:20.436]  Number three.
[00:32:20.436 --> 00:32:24.039]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:27.741]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:27.921 --> 00:32:28.722]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.722 --> 00:32:31.484]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.484 --> 00:32:35.168]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.168 --> 00:32:35.969]  Number 5.
[00:32:35.969 --> 00:32:40.112]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.112 --> 00:32:44.877]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.157 --> 00:32:49.322]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.322 --> 00:32:51.124]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.124 --> 00:32:53.367]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.367 --> 00:32:55.729]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:07.677 --> 00:33:16.684]  There is no doubt that the media and the government is trying to hype this oil spill to be a lot worse than it is.
[00:33:16.684 --> 00:33:19.846]  There have been other oil spills that have been larger.
[00:33:19.846 --> 00:33:25.391]  Though if it continues to leak, it will surpass those in the next few weeks, it is estimated.
[00:33:26.977 --> 00:33:46.511]  The fact that Barack Obama for 70 plus days has blocked foreign governments from coming in with giant oil skimmers like the one we've been talking about the last two weeks, the Taiwanese trawler, the mega ship that can scoop half a million barrels a day.
[00:33:46.511 --> 00:33:50.834]  Half a million barrels a day.
[00:33:50.834 --> 00:33:51.435]  Out of the Gulf.
[00:33:54.878 --> 00:33:58.001]  That is more than all of the relief ships in the U.S.
[00:33:58.001 --> 00:33:59.782]  fleet combined.
[00:33:59.782 --> 00:34:04.246]  One ship, and there are more than 30 of them that have been standing by.
[00:34:04.246 --> 00:34:07.069]  So I have to deal with what I can prove.
[00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:21.182]  The government is blocking criminally relief efforts that would have mitigated this to a great extent.
[00:34:23.598 --> 00:34:29.402]  And we know they're trying to pass a carbon tax in its stead, but I'm going to cover that more later.
[00:34:29.402 --> 00:34:44.532]  I'm going to give you the toll-free number to join us if you are police, military, corporate, government individuals with specific first-hand knowledge.
[00:34:44.532 --> 00:34:48.294]  I don't want to play the telephone game, you know, where you go around the table whispering in somebody's ear.
[00:34:48.294 --> 00:34:51.897]  By the time it makes it around the table, the story's completely changed.
[00:34:51.897 --> 00:34:53.098]  I would like to specifically
[00:34:54.161 --> 00:34:57.602]  Here from you, dealing with evacuations.
[00:34:57.602 --> 00:35:10.528]  Now I have the AP, I have the Washington Post, I have other publications where high-powered globalists are on record saying that they believe there's going to be 20 million people evacuated.
[00:35:10.528 --> 00:35:18.551]  Remember the headline a week and a half ago, two weeks ago, Oil Industry Insider and CFR member predicts Gulf evacuation?
[00:35:20.407 --> 00:35:45.748]  Buried in an article in the Gulf of Mexico Scenarios and Predictions on the Washington Post news site, founder and chairman emeritus of Simons and Company International, said in response to the tropical storm brewing in the Caribbean that's now come and gone, Alex, Simmons says, we're going to have to evacuate the Gulf states.
[00:35:45.748 --> 00:35:48.170]  Can you imagine evacuating 20 million people?
[00:35:49.517 --> 00:35:52.418]  This story is 80 times worse than I thought.
[00:35:52.418 --> 00:35:58.499]  Now, is he picking up the feedback loop of the incredible fear-mongering going on out there?
[00:35:58.499 --> 00:36:02.920]  By a lot of sites and organizations?
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.381]  And then, is this a feedback loop?
[00:36:05.381 --> 00:36:06.681]  Is he regurgitating?
[00:36:06.681 --> 00:36:14.923]  Or is this Council on Foreign Relations member out there pushing and promoting this to create fear?
[00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:16.784]  And the fact that it's in the Washington Post, it's...
[00:36:18.339 --> 00:36:25.644]  That's pretty much, you can't get more establishment than that publication.
[00:36:25.644 --> 00:36:26.285]  But I don't know.
[00:36:26.285 --> 00:36:28.926]  I mean, we know this crude oil's toxic.
[00:36:28.926 --> 00:36:38.453]  All crude oil has some toxins in it, but this is particularly nasty, filled with all these different chemicals, benzene, the list goes on and on.
[00:36:38.453 --> 00:36:43.297]  We know that over 150 million gallons, conservatively, is poured into the Gulf.
[00:36:43.297 --> 00:36:45.078]  We know it's just out there floating around.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:54.185]  Between 50 and 300 miles offshore, it's spread all over the Gulf.
[00:36:54.185 --> 00:37:04.153]  The currents are starting to carry it out into the Atlantic, past the Florida Keys.
[00:37:04.153 --> 00:37:10.918]  And the hurricane season is starting, and set to drive that oil directly into shore.
[00:37:10.918 --> 00:37:13.881]  And I know everybody's talked about this, and we've discussed it ad nauseum.
[00:37:15.439 --> 00:37:18.300]  It's just we're getting deeper and deeper and deeper into this.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:33.683]  And if you add the way the media is hyping it, I mean, I've been spot checking CNN, MSNBC and others, and they are behaving as if it is the end of the world.
[00:37:33.683 --> 00:37:38.864]  Last Friday, I was watching MSNBC again, and it was the same thing I saw the night before.
[00:37:38.864 --> 00:37:40.584]  They cut to reporters on the beach.
[00:37:41.724 --> 00:37:50.810]  And there was just a tiny patina, kind of like scum you'll get in your bathtub if you don't clean it for a couple weeks.
[00:37:50.810 --> 00:38:08.361]  There was just a little line, maybe a foot wide, up on the high water mark, the tide mark, where oil had been brought into the Florida panhandle, and they were acting like it was the end of the world, actually hyperventilating.
[00:38:15.666 --> 00:38:17.967]  And last week I had one of my mistakes on air.
[00:38:17.967 --> 00:38:19.328]  I always get names flipped around.
[00:38:19.328 --> 00:38:21.329]  It wasn't Corbin.
[00:38:21.329 --> 00:38:27.993]  That guy died from a... from a stingray.
[00:38:27.993 --> 00:38:28.994]  Or whatever his name was.
[00:38:28.994 --> 00:38:30.054]  I don't remember.
[00:38:30.054 --> 00:38:32.196]  It's the other one that's still alive who's an American.
[00:38:32.196 --> 00:38:34.497]  He's got dark hair.
[00:38:34.497 --> 00:38:38.159]  What's that guy's name who runs around in the bush?
[00:38:38.159 --> 00:38:41.361]  And he's a big environmentalist, always demonizing humans at the end of the show?
[00:38:43.547 --> 00:38:44.027]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:44.027 --> 00:38:45.728]  They have one of those nature guys on.
[00:38:45.728 --> 00:38:48.949]  I don't watch a lot of television.
[00:38:48.949 --> 00:38:57.253]  And he literally went for 10 minutes without taking a breath, just saying that these beaches are never coming back.
[00:38:57.253 --> 00:38:59.614]  These estuaries are never coming back.
[00:38:59.614 --> 00:39:08.338]  These fisheries and marshes are never coming back, ever.
[00:39:08.338 --> 00:39:10.639]  I mean, I thought it was the end of the world if I didn't know better.
[00:39:11.607 --> 00:39:18.413]  The truth is, oil is toxic, but it's very biodegradable, and there are a lot of different species of bacteria that are naturally occurring.
[00:39:18.413 --> 00:39:27.260]  In fact, that was the Obama administration's excuse for not spraying oil-eating microbes on it, as they pointed out.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:36.888]  Well, there are hundreds and hundreds in the Gulf, different varieties of bacteria and other microbes that eat oil, so most of this oil will be eaten up in a few years, and that's true.
[00:39:40.814 --> 00:39:44.076]  But not before it comes in and really hurts the fishing.
[00:39:44.076 --> 00:39:46.418]  Not before it comes in and really causes a problem.
[00:39:46.418 --> 00:39:57.126]  And if you don't clean up most of it when it's out to sea, when it all stacks up and gets blown into shore by hurricanes, if you get any fraction, 10, 20, 30%,
[00:39:59.642 --> 00:40:04.346]  And they're reporting that conservatively, that's probably what's gonna come in when some big hurricanes hit.
[00:40:04.346 --> 00:40:17.199]  You take 20, 30, 40 million gallons of oil, and you dump that on the Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida coast, and then it goes around through the Keys, and up the East Coast, it is going to be hellish!
[00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.071]  And some of that oil's gonna go around the world.
[00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:30.135]  I'll guarantee you in 10 years, some of that stuff's gonna be washing up on the Pacific side of South America and the United States.
[00:40:30.135 --> 00:40:31.816]  In fact, I've seen giant tarballs.
[00:40:31.816 --> 00:40:37.699]  A few months ago, I was down at the Texas beach and there was a tarball probably the size, my dad took a picture of it.
[00:40:37.699 --> 00:40:40.200]  He went down there with us fishing with the kids.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.541]  It was probably the size of a football.
[00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:46.323]  And it was this big blob, but it was hard.
[00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.711]  of tar, of old oil.
[00:40:49.711 --> 00:40:59.414]  And it had mollusks growing on it, it had barnacles, it had little worms, it had... I mean, that thing was a floating island of life.
[00:40:59.414 --> 00:41:01.614]  And who knows where it came from?
[00:41:01.614 --> 00:41:04.395]  But it was as hard as a rock.
[00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:07.436]  And there were all these creatures living on it.
[00:41:07.436 --> 00:41:14.738]  So I would imagine, a decade from now, there'll be big tar balls floating up.
[00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:16.599]  But most of it is going to be eaten.
[00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:23.604]  But if it blows into shore, while it's still off-gassing, it's going to be a crisis.
[00:41:23.604 --> 00:41:28.546]  And there probably will be some towns that people have got to move back 10-15 miles.
[00:41:28.546 --> 00:41:29.466]  But you know the government.
[00:41:29.466 --> 00:41:30.307]  They love a good crisis.
[00:41:30.307 --> 00:41:35.809]  They love an excuse to come in with troops, boss people around, go into houses, rob people's homes.
[00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:39.390]  Remember what police all over Louisiana and Mississippi got caught doing on video?
[00:41:40.714 --> 00:41:51.502]  Going in, ripping the front doors off pawn shops and jewelry stores, and stealing the safes, going into Walmart, running everybody else out who was stealing so they could steal.
[00:41:51.502 --> 00:41:54.244]  Filling their carts with television sets.
[00:41:54.244 --> 00:41:58.127]  I mean, let's face it, America on average is very decadent and very immoral.
[00:41:58.127 --> 00:42:01.149]  And police are made up of decadent, immoral people.
[00:42:01.149 --> 00:42:05.513]  Not all of them, but they're made up of a sampling of what the United States has turned into.
[00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:10.822]  And you've got great officers out there, but more and more, they protect the goons.
[00:42:10.822 --> 00:42:22.585]  They promote the thugs, the lowest common denominator, that'll follow orders, and then enjoy meting out oppression, because that's what the system wants.
[00:42:22.585 --> 00:42:32.708]  And so, when that oil... I mean, if they're acting like it's the end of the world on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox, to some extent, and CNBC,
[00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:44.370]  If they're breathless, talking about the tiny fraction of oil that's already hit, and it is a problem.
[00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:51.956]  If they've already 10 miles inland, in Louisiana, Mississippi, and other areas, declared it a federal disaster area, and are telling people they can't fish.
[00:42:51.956 --> 00:43:01.804]  I mean, I see it in the news every day, where families, 10 miles in, are bass fishing on vacation, in completely beautiful blue lakes.
[00:43:03.025 --> 00:43:06.526]  Uh, that are connected to the ocean waterways.
[00:43:06.526 --> 00:43:13.908]  And the BP people, the local police, the game wardens, the Coast Guard comes up and says, you can't fish here.
[00:43:13.908 --> 00:43:15.589]  Get off this lake.
[00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:17.750]  Any excuse to boss people around.
[00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:23.051]  But then 10 miles away, where the oil's coming in, we're now almost 80 days.
[00:43:23.051 --> 00:43:24.392]  What is it?
[00:43:24.392 --> 00:43:24.612]  Day 76, 77?
[00:43:28.294 --> 00:43:31.295]  They are not letting people clean up the oil.
[00:43:31.295 --> 00:43:40.637]  The religion of government is setting up a precedent to expand their jurisdiction.
[00:43:40.637 --> 00:43:44.838]  Criminally, illegally, illegitimately.
[00:43:44.838 --> 00:43:47.219]  And so they expanded their jurisdiction in New Orleans.
[00:43:47.219 --> 00:43:52.780]  They went in, didn't bring in food and water, blocked people from getting it, wouldn't let people exit the city, wouldn't let them walk out over the highways.
[00:43:54.016 --> 00:43:57.337]  Ordered police to shoot and kill families trying to come out.
[00:43:57.337 --> 00:44:05.859]  We told you at the time, Charles in Louisiana, he's been calling in for 13 years, a good source of info, sent us a lot of good info over the years.
[00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:17.622]  He called in and said, well, today, Mr. Jones, they shot some people, peaceful families, trying to get out, trying to walk over the highway system, which is high and dry, and they shot them.
[00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:19.523]  And a year later, it came out, there'd been a
[00:44:20.919 --> 00:44:22.740]  Cover up that it had happened.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:36.345]  And three years after that, some of the police officers that followed the orders, and they're still guilty, but not as guilty as those that gave the orders to them, to shoot those people and drive back a crowd of men, women, and children trying to get out.
[00:44:36.345 --> 00:44:40.107]  You're not gonna get out.
[00:44:40.107 --> 00:44:48.830]  They've set the precedent that they can either tell you to get out when you don't need to leave, or they can lock you down in a city and make you stay there.
[00:44:51.395 --> 00:44:53.596]  76 days in.
[00:44:53.596 --> 00:44:56.538]  76 days in.
[00:44:56.538 --> 00:45:12.407]  And where are the Norwegian, and the Dutch, and the Taiwanese, and the Japanese, and the German, and the Brazilian mega-ships that can come in and suck up tens of thousands of barrels a day individually?
[00:45:12.407 --> 00:45:14.708]  Some of the ships, a quarter million barrels.
[00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:23.369]  300,000, 400,000 barrels in one ship, 500,000 barrels a day.
[00:45:23.369 --> 00:45:29.931]  And I just keep beating that drum.
[00:45:29.931 --> 00:45:32.532]  Because this is a crisis they're not going to let go to waste.
[00:45:33.547 --> 00:45:40.395]  They need this ecological disaster to hammer through their takeover of all Western industry.
[00:45:40.395 --> 00:45:45.100]  When you hear green industry, that means the government says what type of industry you can have.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:52.047]  That means they say you've got to buy this type of generator, or this type of electrical transmission system, or you can't have that type of factory.
[00:45:52.668 --> 00:45:54.590]  Or you can't have this type of house.
[00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:57.032]  Or you can't have that type of business.
[00:45:57.032 --> 00:45:59.474]  Or you can't have a pond on your property.
[00:45:59.474 --> 00:46:02.297]  This is total feudalism and serfdom.
[00:46:02.297 --> 00:46:03.878]  And they're announcing it in Europe!
[00:46:03.878 --> 00:46:06.000]  Can't have a space heater outside.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.962]  Can't have a fireplace.
[00:46:07.962 --> 00:46:12.706]  You've got to have a zero carbon footprint home.
[00:46:12.706 --> 00:46:14.748]  Families aren't allowed to live in a home by themselves.
[00:46:14.748 --> 00:46:15.809]  That's too wasteful.
[00:46:15.809 --> 00:46:17.411]  You must all live in dormitories.
[00:46:21.471 --> 00:46:38.885]  I've got stacks of mainstream news here today in front of me where they now admit in England, London Telegraph, they're all reporting on it, that the government does indeed have quotas of absolutely innocent families and their newborn babies before the babies are born.
[00:46:38.885 --> 00:46:44.810]  They're even looking for hair color, eye color, you name it, for rich families that are going to adopt them.
[00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.092]  Of course, we are harvested by government.
[00:46:48.257 --> 00:46:52.522]  And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, I know you know this.
[00:46:52.522 --> 00:47:10.280]  In fact, I said I was going to get to this, and I am now, and we're going to come back and take phone calls from people that have specific intel on preparations for evacuation in the Gulf States.
[00:47:14.375 --> 00:47:15.616]  Specific information.
[00:47:15.616 --> 00:47:26.422]  It doesn't have to be specific information that it's going to happen or that you've told it's going to be something that's taking place in the near future.
[00:47:26.422 --> 00:47:32.206]  It just needs to be whether you've been told that it's a possibility.
[00:47:32.206 --> 00:47:35.928]  Or if you have been told they're preparing for it, what those preparations are.
[00:47:35.928 --> 00:47:36.789]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:47:36.789 --> 00:47:36.849]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:47:44.358 --> 00:47:51.099]  9-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[00:47:51.099 --> 00:47:51.560]  Again, 800-259-9231.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:48:11.364]  Boy, I tell you, two days being off and coming back in here and looking at all this news this morning and reading over this,
[00:48:14.315 --> 00:48:15.175]  My head is spinning.
[00:48:15.175 --> 00:48:25.037]  What about yours?
[00:48:25.037 --> 00:48:27.638]  My head is spinning right now.
[00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:31.219]  And I understand why people are living in denial out there.
[00:48:31.219 --> 00:48:35.139]  I know why people don't want to believe this is really happening.
[00:48:35.139 --> 00:48:36.680]  Tyranny comes in incrementally.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.340]  It happens slowly.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.081]  It's creeping death.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:42.641]  Creeping death of our society.
[00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:57.881]  But the prognosis, any way you slice it, runs from bad to worse.
[00:48:57.881 --> 00:49:03.286]  And I don't know if they're gonna cap the oil well anytime soon.
[00:49:03.286 --> 00:49:09.111]  I don't know how devastating it's gonna be when the majority of that oil gets blown in by those hurricanes.
[00:49:12.205 --> 00:49:21.933]  I don't know if they're gonna launch an attack on Iran, even though the mainstream media says they're gearing up to do it, and it's pretty much a foregone conclusion.
[00:49:21.933 --> 00:49:24.134]  But I'll tell you what I do know.
[00:49:24.134 --> 00:49:31.300]  I know that we're all becoming acclimated, even if you're against all this evil.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.902]  At some level, we're all becoming comfortable with it.
[00:49:33.902 --> 00:49:35.844]  We're becoming accustomed to it.
[00:49:35.844 --> 00:49:37.405]  We're becoming accepting of it.
[00:49:39.394 --> 00:49:42.896]  And that's why we really can't approach this emotionally.
[00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:52.480]  It's good to get emotional and angry to get moving, but you have to follow up with focused, cold determination.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:50:00.984]  You have to make it a goal to wake up as many people as you can and to defend this republic and to restore this republic, whatever it takes.
[00:50:00.984 --> 00:50:06.046]  Because I realize reading this news this morning that I don't even want to cover it.
[00:50:08.137 --> 00:50:21.588]  Believe me, I want to just walk away and go hide out in a farmhouse somewhere and just make the commitment that anybody comes here and tries to violate my rights, they're going to have a problem.
[00:50:21.588 --> 00:50:22.108]  But you know what?
[00:50:22.108 --> 00:50:26.572]  That is a loser mentality.
[00:50:26.572 --> 00:50:29.194]  You cannot run and hide from this.
[00:50:29.194 --> 00:50:30.275]  You've got to meet it head on.
[00:50:30.275 --> 00:50:31.796]  It's the only way.
[00:50:31.796 --> 00:50:35.499]  Because I know the government shipping and the narcotics.
[00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.721]  I know the government is totally criminal.
[00:50:38.738 --> 00:50:46.046]  I know they've engineered a depression, and that we're in a depression, and now the mainstream media is admitting we're in a depression.
[00:50:46.046 --> 00:50:55.577]  I know that the establishment is adding sterilants and toxins and carcinogens by design to our water and food.
[00:50:55.577 --> 00:50:59.982]  And I know that my children deserve to not drink that, and I'm going to stop these people.
[00:51:02.588 --> 00:51:03.808]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:03.808 --> 00:51:06.329]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.230]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:15.433]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.433 --> 00:51:19.835]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:19.835 --> 00:51:30.079]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:30.339 --> 00:51:31.980]  Under any circumstance.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:39.183]  These and other closely guarded gun cashing secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:51:39.183 --> 00:51:39.883]  But listen up.
[00:51:39.883 --> 00:51:46.126]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:51:46.126 --> 00:51:47.986]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:47.986 --> 00:51:50.147]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:50.147 --> 00:51:50.628]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:50.628 --> 00:51:52.528]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:51:52.528 --> 00:51:53.129]  Hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:53.129 --> 00:51:53.709]  Right now.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:05.644]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.644 --> 00:52:06.644]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.644 --> 00:52:09.086]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.086 --> 00:52:10.107]  A republic.
[00:52:10.107 --> 00:52:12.749]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.749 --> 00:52:15.011]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.011 --> 00:52:17.032]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.032 --> 00:52:18.733]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.733 --> 00:52:20.034]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.034 --> 00:52:20.655]  Children?
[00:52:20.655 --> 00:52:21.776]  Our education?
[00:52:21.776 --> 00:52:22.596]  Our money?
[00:52:22.596 --> 00:52:26.259]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.619 --> 00:52:30.304]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.304 --> 00:52:31.586]  You are being warned.
[00:52:31.586 --> 00:52:32.607]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.607 --> 00:52:33.769]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.769 --> 00:52:34.670]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:35.551]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.551 --> 00:52:38.075]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.075 --> 00:52:41.860]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.923]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.923 --> 00:52:48.424]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.424 --> 00:52:49.504]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:49.504 --> 00:52:56.368]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.

[00:54:29.622 --> 00:54:32.524]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:54:32.524 --> 00:54:42.251]  I'm going to take some of your phone calls, specifically for people that have any intel on evacuations.
[00:54:42.251 --> 00:54:48.135]  Have you been told they're preparing for forced evacuations in areas of the Gulf?
[00:54:48.135 --> 00:54:52.799]  Or have you been told when you're working in and around this that that's not being planned?
[00:54:52.799 --> 00:54:56.321]  Do you know what the mitigation program is?
[00:54:56.321 --> 00:54:56.461]  When?
[00:54:59.056 --> 00:55:06.320]  This hundred plus million barrels of oil gets blown in by the hurricanes that are now forming.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.662]  We're going into the tropical storm slash hurricane season.
[00:55:09.662 --> 00:55:10.242]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:55:10.242 --> 00:55:10.962]  And I realize what it is.
[00:55:10.962 --> 00:55:13.043]  I started the show and I read these headlines.
[00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:15.105]  Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[00:55:15.105 --> 00:55:15.905]  CNBC.
[00:55:26.087 --> 00:55:28.449]  Here's a London Telegraph article.
[00:55:28.449 --> 00:55:29.150]  With the U.S.
[00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:32.093]  trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[00:55:32.093 --> 00:55:38.839]  Then I look at these headlines.
[00:55:38.839 --> 00:55:42.402]  This is out of the Globe and Mail, out of Canada.
[00:55:42.402 --> 00:55:43.683]  Happy 4th of July!
[00:55:43.683 --> 00:55:45.765]  America needs it!
[00:55:45.765 --> 00:55:49.609]  The Great Republic is in a perilous state, politically and economically.
[00:55:53.203 --> 00:56:02.409]  And there's all these articles about how the United States is tottering towards collapse, complete collapse.
[00:56:02.409 --> 00:56:07.453]  Now, we've known this was happening for a very long time.
[00:56:07.453 --> 00:56:13.337]  And we knew what the causes of it would be, mainly false debt derivatives.
[00:56:13.337 --> 00:56:14.537]  And we knew it was by design.
[00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:19.941]  The very same central banks have done this in smaller third world nations by smaller GDP.
[00:56:23.004 --> 00:56:26.227]  And so we know they've done it over and over and over again.
[00:56:26.227 --> 00:56:30.410]  They're just going after the biggest target they've ever hit.
[00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:38.197]  And if they're able to complete this conversion from liberty to total tyranny, it's going to be hell.
[00:56:38.197 --> 00:56:39.378]  I mean, do you have any idea?
[00:56:39.378 --> 00:56:42.621]  And I'm asking myself that.
[00:56:43.772 --> 00:56:44.732]  Right now.
[00:56:44.732 --> 00:56:45.733]  I'm not just asking you.
[00:56:45.733 --> 00:56:59.658]  Do we have any idea what it's going to be like to be in a third world police state in a nation of spoiled brats, many of which don't want to work, that have been living off people who do want to work?
[00:56:59.658 --> 00:57:08.802]  And with all of the gangster mentality and all of the glorification of crime and just the immorality, can you imagine
[00:57:09.915 --> 00:57:10.336]  I don't
[00:57:24.855 --> 00:57:28.356]  Skin a buck and run a trot line, a country boy can survive.
[00:57:28.356 --> 00:57:41.441]  Well, today, right at 90%, the roles are reversed, of the population lives in urban areas, and only half of the 10% that is truly rural is self-sufficient.
[00:57:41.441 --> 00:57:44.462]  5% of America knows how to feed themselves.
[00:57:44.462 --> 00:57:46.603]  What do you think's gonna happen to those 5%?
[00:57:46.603 --> 00:57:49.044]  You're gonna be overrun.
[00:57:49.044 --> 00:57:50.725]  Crime exploded during the Great Depression.
[00:57:51.616 --> 00:57:54.597]  Can you imagine what is going to happen here?
[00:57:54.597 --> 00:57:57.077]  And we know what the government's gonna do.
[00:57:57.077 --> 00:58:03.339]  They're all living in offshore armored compounds in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean and the South Pacific on record.
[00:58:03.339 --> 00:58:09.601]  They were all evacuating four years ago because they designed what we're about to go through.
[00:58:09.601 --> 00:58:10.221]  Comprende?
[00:58:10.221 --> 00:58:14.542]  That's why when I get up here and I talk about this not being a joke, folks, it's not.
[00:58:14.542 --> 00:58:15.803]  I get white-knuckled, okay?
[00:58:15.803 --> 00:58:16.923]  I have nightmares over this.
[00:58:18.424 --> 00:58:24.587]  I look at my children, and they're so innocent and so beautiful and so good, I start crying now.
[00:58:24.587 --> 00:58:30.350]  And not sobbing, just tears involuntarily start coming out the edges of my eyes.
[00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:33.311]  And it makes me so mad at the New World Order.
[00:58:33.311 --> 00:58:37.394]  And on the 4th of July, I cried, because they've destroyed this country.
[00:58:37.394 --> 00:58:42.296]  They've destroyed everything we ever are and ever were.
[00:58:42.296 --> 00:58:44.917]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.917 --> 00:58:46.918]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:54.176 --> 00:58:55.437]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:55.437 --> 00:58:59.379]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.379 --> 00:59:01.601]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:07.464]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:07.464 --> 00:59:13.688]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.128 --> 00:59:20.071]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.071 --> 00:59:24.292]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.292 --> 00:59:28.574]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:28.574 --> 00:59:34.516]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:34.516 --> 00:59:38.078]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.078 --> 00:59:40.059]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.059 --> 00:59:40.479]  It's here.

[00:59:55.539 --> 00:59:58.322]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.086 --> 01:00:09.932]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.932 --> 01:00:11.514]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.514 --> 01:00:13.076]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:17.262]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.262 --> 01:00:21.347]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.033 --> 01:00:35.915]  All right, we're into hour number two, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:35.915 --> 01:00:40.997]  On this July 5th, 2010 edition, Bob in Michigan and others are holding.
[01:00:40.997 --> 01:00:43.738]  I want intel on Gulf evacuations.
[01:00:43.738 --> 01:00:48.940]  A month and a half ago, I saw reports that evacuations had already begun.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:53.682]  I made phone calls to supposed towns and it was not true.
[01:00:53.682 --> 01:00:57.464]  But just when I'm about to say, oh great, that's not the case,
[01:00:59.818 --> 01:01:08.620]  I have this article out of PrisonPlanet.com where Oil Industry Insider and CFR member predicts Gulf evacuation.
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.060]  We're going to have to evacuate the Gulf.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.181]  Can you imagine evacuating 20 million people?
[01:01:13.181 --> 01:01:15.081]  This story is 80 times worse than I thought.
[01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:17.002]  That's the Washington Post.
[01:01:17.002 --> 01:01:23.443]  Now, I'm not blaming people that are running around like chickens with their heads cut off because when the hurricanes blow that oil in, it's going to be bad.
[01:01:25.134 --> 01:01:31.798]  And the Feds have never allowed berms or anything to be built to stop even a little bit of oil that's come in per capita.
[01:01:31.798 --> 01:01:37.322]  And it's treason, it's criminal, but they think we're so dumb they're allowing it to happen.
[01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:45.447]  So, I'm gonna open the phones up and see if we get any good information.
[01:01:45.447 --> 01:01:47.548]  In fact, guys, will you give me a pen?
[01:01:47.548 --> 01:01:49.089]  All I have is a Sharpie.
[01:01:49.089 --> 01:01:52.472]  I wanna write notes when people call in so I can check what they say.
[01:01:54.036 --> 01:01:56.082]  Uh, and, uh, the sharp you'll bleed through.
[01:01:56.082 --> 01:01:57.527]  Thanks a million, Matt.
[01:01:57.527 --> 01:01:57.728]  Great.
[01:01:59.503 --> 01:02:27.050]  1-800-259-9231 but then I'm going to really boil down the position we're in and what's happening with the economy and what I believe is going to happen next and what I think we can do to counter these criminals because they are now just like in 2007 they started getting everybody ready for the controlled housing implosion as the cover for the engineered depression and now they're telling you we're in a depression and get ready for total collapse which means they're
[01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:30.976]  Strongly considering pulling the plug.
[01:02:30.976 --> 01:02:37.710]  We're already circling the toilet bowl slowly, but they're starting to accelerate that.
[01:02:41.129 --> 01:02:54.652]  And of course, we would expect with a new war and with a full-blown depression, an economic collapse, they would shut down the web, so they're getting all the couch potatoes ready for that, telling them how essential it is every day.
[01:02:54.652 --> 01:02:56.213]  So, things don't look good.
[01:02:56.213 --> 01:02:58.133]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:02:58.133 --> 01:03:06.215]  We've been building towards this point for the last 15 years that I've been on air, trying to warn you about the bankers and what they've done to every other country they control.
[01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:07.295]  And here we are.
[01:03:07.295 --> 01:03:10.556]  We're in a good position to fight them, better than we would have been,
[01:03:15.939 --> 01:03:29.063]  Because we have been here speaking out and because we understood the globalist game plan.
[01:03:29.063 --> 01:03:31.143]  But we're still in very, very dire straits.
[01:03:31.143 --> 01:03:33.264]  And when I say we're in a better position,
[01:03:35.391 --> 01:03:38.233]  We're ready for the punch that's getting thrown in our stomach.
[01:03:38.233 --> 01:03:40.214]  It doesn't mean it's gonna feel good.
[01:03:40.214 --> 01:03:41.675]  At least some of us are ready.
[01:03:41.675 --> 01:03:46.999]  Alright, I'm gonna go to break and come back so Bob doesn't get cut short and go to Bob in Michigan and others, but if you've gotten the intel...
[01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:58.383]  Or, you know, if your husband's out on an oil rig and he's been told some information you want to tell us, or you're a police officer in the Gulf, and I'm sure you've asked, what are we going to do when the oil comes ashore?
[01:03:58.383 --> 01:03:59.404]  What have you been told?
[01:03:59.404 --> 01:04:03.307]  Or are they keeping that information close to their vest?
[01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.108]  It was compartmentalized.
[01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:13.014]  You know, the mere fact that they're not preparing for an evacuation, or at least telling lower-level personnel, that tells you as much
[01:04:13.965 --> 01:04:14.686]  I don't think so.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.983]  All of that oil coming to shore, and as the Gulf heats up in August and September, that's when it gets its hottest.
[01:04:28.983 --> 01:04:35.386]  It takes the first few months of summer to really get it hot, and then by August and September, it's like bathtub water.
[01:04:35.386 --> 01:04:44.670]  Then all that methane, all that natural gas, all that oil plume that's underwater, because most of it's underwater, it's going to off-gas even worse.
[01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:51.133]  And some experts are talking about, you know, 100 miles inland, there being toxic clouds, because oil doesn't
[01:04:54.610 --> 01:05:00.751]  Listen up, folks.
[01:05:00.751 --> 01:05:01.691]  This is important.
[01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:02.791]  Alex Jones here.

[01:08:32.836 --> 01:08:40.880]  A county nurse was not given permission to go onto the BP property when she finally did that.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:56.107]  The people who work at BP who were coming to see her were only allowed to get band-aids and aspirin from her and they were told that they only could go to the BP doctors if they wanted to get treated.
[01:08:56.107 --> 01:09:01.410]  President Obama touched on the health issues in particular in the Gulf today and I want to play this.
[01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:01.670]  Listen.
[01:09:02.384 --> 01:09:15.792]  So far we have seen that on shore we are not seeing huge elevations in toxins in the air or in the water.
[01:09:15.792 --> 01:09:21.695]  But that may not be the case out where people are actually doing the work.
[01:09:21.695 --> 01:09:26.178]  And we've got to make sure that we are providing all the protections that are necessary
[01:09:27.007 --> 01:09:31.453]  Do you think the administration is doing enough?
[01:09:31.453 --> 01:09:37.320]  Okay, we're going to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 if you've got any specific intel.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.622]  This has been going on for weeks.
[01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:47.740]  They are saying that the dispersant is not bad for you, though it admittedly has the skull and crossbones on the container.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:53.722]  They have put millions and millions and millions of gallons of the dispersant into the Gulf.
[01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:54.762]  It is much worse.
[01:09:54.762 --> 01:10:02.943]  This is one of the cases where the disease is more preferable than the cure, where the cure is worse than the disease.
[01:10:02.943 --> 01:10:05.204]  And that's Obama, a paid corporate liar.
[01:10:06.084 --> 01:10:07.945]  Who will tell you that there's no health problems?
[01:10:07.945 --> 01:10:09.967]  People have died.
[01:10:09.967 --> 01:10:14.670]  Mainline medical doctors have seen the workers are saying that their lungs are completely fried.
[01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:19.152]  That they're dead men walking.
[01:10:19.152 --> 01:10:26.977]  The average life expectancy from the Exxon Valdez, where they use these same dispersants, is 51 years.
[01:10:26.977 --> 01:10:32.141]  That's 20 plus years less than the average life expectancy.
[01:10:32.141 --> 01:10:32.981]  In fact, roughly 25 years less.
[01:10:32.981 --> 01:10:33.121]  So...
[01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:37.686]  There you have it.
[01:10:37.686 --> 01:10:41.568]  And BP has its own little special doctors.
[01:10:41.568 --> 01:10:45.470]  And now the oil is coming in towards the shore.
[01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:54.075]  And you better believe that just like with the 9-11 victims and the emergency workers, they were not given treatment.
[01:10:54.075 --> 01:10:57.696]  And it was covered up for close to a decade.
[01:10:57.696 --> 01:11:04.060]  And I've seen New York Post articles calling the police and firemen ambulance chasers, though they're dying or dead.
[01:11:05.302 --> 01:11:21.546]  All these universities have done CAT scans, just countless universities, their doctors have come out, medical centers have said, we CAT scanned their lungs, they're full of asbestos and mercury and pulverized dust and concrete and glass and they're dying!
[01:11:22.848 --> 01:11:43.038]  I've been there with these military men and women, firemen and police, and they will be walking around, 35, 45-year-old men and women with tanks of oxygen, and they will, in the green room with you, and I've been at 9-11 events in New York, they will say, excuse me, and you'll go around the corner and they're coughing blood up in a handkerchief.
[01:11:43.658 --> 01:11:43.918]  I think?
[01:12:03.143 --> 01:12:04.884]  weapons residue when the U.S.
[01:12:04.884 --> 01:12:07.907]  blew up the weapons systems they'd sold Saddam.
[01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:10.809]  They were getting rid of the evidence at Kamasi and other bunkers.
[01:12:10.809 --> 01:12:17.534]  When people came back and their brain stems shriveled up and they died, they did autopsies and would even find that they died of nerve agents.
[01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:25.240]  But the government said, we're not giving a red cent to your family because you aren't just cheap, you're seen as trash to them.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.501]  All right, let's go to Bob in Michigan.
[01:12:26.501 --> 01:12:27.682]  Bob, thanks for holding.
[01:12:27.682 --> 01:12:29.184]  Tell us the info you've got.
[01:12:30.444 --> 01:12:47.792]  Okay, well it's not evacuation plans, but I work for a manufacturing company up here in Walker, Michigan, and we have a contract with BP to build oil booms, and about five days ago,
[01:12:48.747 --> 01:12:49.047]  I don't
[01:13:07.976 --> 01:13:10.738]  A chain link that runs all the way through the side of the boom.
[01:13:10.738 --> 01:13:18.382]  And how they wanted it redesigned is where they put a little metal eyelet inside of the nylon fabric and then run a quarter inch cable through it.
[01:13:18.382 --> 01:13:22.104]  So basically the anchor will like rip right through the material.
[01:13:22.104 --> 01:13:26.346]  And I've got that on audio right here from my foreman.
[01:13:26.346 --> 01:13:29.128]  That company was in the newspaper about three days ago.
[01:13:29.128 --> 01:13:36.552]  They did a big story about how like, you know, BP is putting Americans to work and Americans are working to, you know, solve this right now.
[01:13:37.475 --> 01:13:38.116]  All this stuff.
[01:13:38.116 --> 01:13:41.959]  The name of the company is Prestige Parts in Walker, Michigan.
[01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:45.902]  I'm probably going to try and get at least three or four of the other guys that work there to call you and talk to you.
[01:13:45.902 --> 01:13:46.922]  My girlfriend's right here.
[01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:47.903]  She's quality control.
[01:13:47.903 --> 01:13:49.364]  She knows it, but she won't get on the phone.
[01:13:49.364 --> 01:13:52.607]  Yeah, that's what I got.
[01:13:53.507 --> 01:13:54.809]  Incredible information.
[01:13:54.809 --> 01:13:58.993]  Well, this fits in with Obama blocking all of the skimmer ships.
[01:13:58.993 --> 01:14:07.923]  This fits in with him dumping his stock the week before that he had in BP, along with the BP CEO, Goldman Sachs, dumping it.
[01:14:07.923 --> 01:14:10.346]  Just record levels of stock being dumped.
[01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:11.387]  But to be specific,
[01:14:12.769 --> 01:14:20.399]  I'm not very familiar with these booms, but I've seen it on the news, and they've already talked about how a lot of them are ineffective.
[01:14:20.399 --> 01:14:28.931]  But what you're saying is, is that it's going to be anchored to something that when waves hit it, it's just going to basically rip the cable out of the nylon?
[01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:29.552]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:14:31.843 --> 01:14:52.519]  My foreman did a PSI test on it because he like tested like the old version versus the new version of how they want it and like it I mean I've got him on tape like right here you know saying that it's like far less effective that basically they wanted ineffectual oil booms to continue to even like keep participating in the contract for a year to buy oil booms from us.
[01:14:52.519 --> 01:14:55.922]  Now here's the 64 million dollar question.
[01:14:55.922 --> 01:14:59.465]  Are these oil booms cheaper?
[01:14:59.465 --> 01:15:00.025]  Yes.
[01:15:00.025 --> 01:15:00.445]  Are they Joe?
[01:15:01.878 --> 01:15:02.939]  Uh, my girlfriend says yes.
[01:15:02.939 --> 01:15:07.481]  She's quality control and her office supervisor.
[01:15:07.481 --> 01:15:09.283]  And so they are somewhat cheaper?
[01:15:09.283 --> 01:15:15.767]  Well, that could be the motive, but see, I mean, that's classic where they just want people to see booms.
[01:15:15.767 --> 01:15:19.789]  It doesn't matter if they basically fall apart like a cheap t-shirt.
[01:15:19.789 --> 01:15:30.816]  I mean, everybody's been to a party or to an event where they hand out free t-shirts, but they're so cheap, the first time you wear it, it starts tearing out of the seams because it's so thin and the stitching falls out.
[01:15:31.596 --> 01:15:49.065]  I mean I've I've seen t-shirts that fall apart when you first put them on so that's basically what this sounds like but would the motive in that be it being inexpensive or would the because they're charged with cleaning it up so you would think that they want to clean it up quick
[01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:55.251]  Because if they don't work, the mitigation is going to be much more expensive.
[01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:59.996]  Or is it because they're in bed with Obama as being the head globalist pushing the carbon tax?
[01:15:59.996 --> 01:16:04.701]  BP literally created it with Ken Lay of Enron, that's on record.
[01:16:04.701 --> 01:16:05.482]  I mean, what do you think?
[01:16:07.327 --> 01:16:19.829]  I think that, you know, it's totally a part, you know, they want to try and get that global carbon tax in, and also, um, I think that, you know, they buy oil booms a lot, and I'm sure that they test their products to see, like, which are the most resilient and effective for the job.
[01:16:19.829 --> 01:16:21.530]  So I'm pretty sure they would know, you know?
[01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:23.190]  I mean, it's their job to know these things.
[01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:26.891]  They, you know, walk around in Armani suits, so I would assume, you know?
[01:16:26.891 --> 01:16:28.351]  I mean, they know.
[01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:29.151]  You know?
[01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:30.991]  So it has to be in for them, you know?
[01:16:30.991 --> 01:16:33.632]  I mean, what's the cost of losing all that oil out there, you know?
[01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:33.872]  I mean...
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:52.432]  If the booms don't catch it so that they can suck the oil up, so the ships can come by and suck the oil up, it's going to be much more expensive for them to clean up what ends up hitting the shore or going into the rivers and estuaries, unless that's what they want.
[01:16:52.432 --> 01:17:00.798]  And on every front, they will aggressively, Obama and BP, do whatever it takes to make sure it's as bad as it can be.
[01:17:00.798 --> 01:17:03.380]  I mean, what do your co-workers think's going on?
[01:17:04.824 --> 01:17:09.347]  Well, all of them say that basically they don't, they want booms that won't even work.
[01:17:09.347 --> 01:17:16.712]  They think it's, like, at least three or four of the people I've talked to think it's a total joke, including the foreman.
[01:17:16.712 --> 01:17:20.094]  And this outfit... Go ahead, sorry.
[01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:25.198]  No, it's just you're saying this outfit that you work for is one of the biggest suppliers of booms?
[01:17:25.198 --> 01:17:32.362]  I don't know if they're one of the biggest suppliers of booms, but they have a contract with BP.
[01:17:32.362 --> 01:17:33.083]  To make all the booms.
[01:17:33.598 --> 01:17:37.001]  But, I mean, like you were saying before, though, about, like, you know, how it benefits them.
[01:17:37.001 --> 01:17:41.885]  I mean, it's priceless for them to be able to try and, like, reinvigorate the environmental movement with this.
[01:17:41.885 --> 01:17:46.269]  So, you know, I mean... And, I mean, like you say, you know, there's tons of oil out there.
[01:17:46.269 --> 01:17:47.591]  They've got all the land they own, too.
[01:17:47.591 --> 01:17:49.833]  They don't build refineries, you know?
[01:17:49.833 --> 01:17:49.973]  So...
[01:17:50.888 --> 01:17:52.810]  Yeah, it's just all, it's all straight.
[01:18:10.851 --> 01:18:27.471]  The problem magically this fits their mo to a T and it also is a nice political diversion while they devalue the dollar and get ready to launch potentially what could trigger World War three with Iran.
[01:18:27.471 --> 01:18:28.272]  Anything else, Bob?
[01:18:30.092 --> 01:18:45.446]  Um, just, I mean, you always talk about wanting people to bring up solutions and stuff like that, and, you know, I think that Debra Medina, even though she kind of like, you know, turned around during her campaign, like, she really laid the basis for, like, economic diffusion and decentralization in the state, you know?
[01:18:45.922 --> 01:18:58.892]  And a lot of states, like that's what we really I think have to do is sort of like re-imagine the Madisonian division of sovereignty between the federal government and the state, and try to equitably distribute that sovereignty between the states, you know, throughout its constituent parts.
[01:18:58.892 --> 01:19:00.254]  Bob, stay in contact with us.
[01:19:00.254 --> 01:19:03.456]  Your phone's really breaking up, but I appreciate you giving us that information.
[01:19:03.456 --> 01:19:09.081]  We'll try to look into that, and of course others can do that as well.
[01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:13.965]  But we know they're blocking the states, and that's why it is important
[01:19:14.915 --> 01:19:15.516]  I don't know.
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:52.828]  In plain view of everyone, if somebody with authority just stands up to them in a media platform and says no, and points out how asinine this is, they'll fold like a house of cards.
[01:19:52.828 --> 01:19:54.329]  1-800-259-9231 for whistleblowers.

[01:20:01.775 --> 01:20:02.516]  The problem.
[01:20:02.516 --> 01:20:05.099]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:20:05.099 --> 01:20:07.822]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:20:07.822 --> 01:20:10.486]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:20:10.486 --> 01:20:12.989]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:20:12.989 --> 01:20:19.036]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water

[01:21:59.938 --> 01:22:06.620]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:14.722]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:14.722 --> 01:22:22.564]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:27.988]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:27.988 --> 01:22:33.211]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:37.554]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:37.554 --> 01:22:38.655]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:03.115]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:23:03.115 --> 01:23:05.395]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:23:05.395 --> 01:23:06.275]  Don't!
[01:23:06.275 --> 01:23:09.716]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:23:09.716 --> 01:23:18.798]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[01:23:18.798 --> 01:23:22.459]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[01:23:39.036 --> 01:23:40.236]  Stop the calls now.
[01:23:40.236 --> 01:23:42.217]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:42.797]  Get Herb K.'
[01:23:42.737 --> 01:23:45.257]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:23:45.257 --> 01:23:45.858]  Call 800-405-7850.
[01:23:45.858 --> 01:23:46.458]  That's 800-405-7850.
[01:23:46.458 --> 01:23:46.498]  800-405-7850.
[01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:13.007]  What has the United States been turned into?
[01:24:13.007 --> 01:24:15.589]  A bunch of domesticated, soft people looking for a free lunch.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.922]  But we haven't gotten a free lunch, have we?
[01:24:40.922 --> 01:24:42.683]  No.
[01:24:42.683 --> 01:24:59.216]  The incredible wealth built up by our forebears has been stolen and the controllers of this nation have run up a six hundred, that's conservative, six hundred trillion dollar debt.
[01:24:59.216 --> 01:25:01.298]  When you hear about a national debt every year,
[01:25:03.234 --> 01:25:07.895]  And you hear about how it's $14 trillion in all of this, that is nothing.
[01:25:07.895 --> 01:25:22.240]  When you actually look at what these bankers have created and how they've tied it to us, the taxpayers, they say we are liable for their derivatives that they have created.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.841]  You see, that's what gives their worthless derivatives value.
[01:25:28.444 --> 01:25:38.249]  They first sell their derivatives out into the market, people buy them who've been defrauded, and the globalists consolidate their power further.
[01:25:38.249 --> 01:25:40.430]  Then, when they're toxic assets...
[01:25:41.479 --> 01:25:48.522]  That they've sold begins to destroy all the major economies and savings of the planet.
[01:25:48.522 --> 01:25:52.484]  The bankers come in as the saviors saying, we've got a solution.
[01:25:52.484 --> 01:25:53.805]  A bank of the world.
[01:25:53.805 --> 01:25:55.746]  We re-monetize the globe.
[01:25:55.746 --> 01:25:58.287]  We devalue all the world's currencies.
[01:25:58.287 --> 01:26:01.349]  But this new currency, it has value.
[01:26:01.349 --> 01:26:02.029]  SDR.
[01:26:04.887 --> 01:26:13.134]  Special drawing rights, which just means the bankers can make up, in a computer, infinity ones and zeros.
[01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:17.618]  Now they already had that power through doubling.
[01:26:17.618 --> 01:26:23.683]  Because they can double money and then double it again and then double it again and double it again through fractional reserve banking.
[01:26:23.683 --> 01:26:28.347]  But with the end of Glass-Steagall 11 years ago, they have transcended even that.
[01:26:30.782 --> 01:26:32.724]  And it's so elementary.
[01:26:32.724 --> 01:26:33.704]  It's so simple.
[01:26:33.704 --> 01:26:35.366]  They are con artists.
[01:26:35.366 --> 01:26:37.447]  They are fraudsters.
[01:26:37.447 --> 01:26:42.151]  I say this every day because if this message doesn't get out, we have no future.
[01:26:42.151 --> 01:26:47.495]  We must expose the fact that Bernie Madoff was the founder of the Nasdaq.
[01:26:47.495 --> 01:26:56.762]  We must expose that he helped set up many of the systems that we are now being destroyed by financially.
[01:26:56.762 --> 01:26:58.563]  And the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:26:59.505 --> 01:27:02.947]  It is destroying our jobs, our industry, everything.
[01:27:02.947 --> 01:27:08.150]  And then you look at Ken Lay and Enron and BP and all of these people.
[01:27:08.150 --> 01:27:13.474]  These are the very individuals that created the new derivative of the carbon tax.
[01:27:13.474 --> 01:27:22.900]  And they've been pushing this and promoting this for 15 years as the main funding mechanism for their new private global government.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:26.062]  This criminal ruling class, this criminal class.
[01:27:27.895 --> 01:27:33.981]  Who has total contempt for us because we've let them bamboozle us to this level.
[01:27:33.981 --> 01:27:35.622]  It is a sick joke.
[01:27:35.622 --> 01:27:37.785]  They laugh at us.
[01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:38.705]  So here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:27:38.705 --> 01:27:52.299]  I'm gonna open the phones up completely, not just for whistleblowers, but for everybody, to specifically give me your ideas of how you think we can get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:27:53.874 --> 01:28:00.097]  And what course of action, concisely, you think we as individuals can take?
[01:28:00.097 --> 01:28:09.540]  But also, which direction we want to force this out-of-control government to go in, and how do we force them to do that?
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:17.884]  But I'll say this, the number one message, and the number one mission that I've got, is simply telling the people who the bad guys are.
[01:28:18.703 --> 01:28:23.810]  The general public is starting to get angry, starting to get focused, starting to awaken.
[01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:31.882]  But they still don't understand who their enemy is completely, and they don't know the depth of corruption, and the depth of ruthlessness.
[01:28:31.882 --> 01:28:33.785]  You must first know your enemy.
[01:28:36.857 --> 01:28:39.958]  And then you've got to have the will to face them down.
[01:28:39.958 --> 01:28:43.140]  And you've got to have the will to make sacrifices.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:29:05.409]  And if you're ashamed to knock on your neighbor's door, or invite them over for coffee and a piece of pie, if you're ashamed to talk to your neighbor, or if you're foolish enough to not understand that just having that neighbor over for coffee and a piece of pie to talk about the state of the world, you begin to shift your attention, their attention, onto issues that are actually important.
[01:29:07.932 --> 01:29:24.181]  See, that's part of the big globalist mind trick, is they say, oh, you don't talk about taxes, you don't talk about politics, you don't talk about religion, you know, oh, it's the weekend, or oh, I'm going bowling with, you know, the boys, or I'm going out with my girlfriends to eat dinner.
[01:29:24.181 --> 01:29:25.182]  Men and women out there,
[01:29:26.246 --> 01:29:26.827]  We're on the march.
[01:29:26.827 --> 01:29:27.527]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.654 --> 01:30:00.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:02.462]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:30:02.462 --> 01:30:04.844]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:30:04.844 --> 01:30:08.048]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:30:08.048 --> 01:30:13.153]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:30:13.153 --> 01:30:17.357]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:30:17.657 --> 01:30:19.998]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:22.879]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:30:22.879 --> 01:30:25.801]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:30:25.801 --> 01:30:33.404]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:39.122]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:30:39.122 --> 01:30:41.443]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:30:41.443 --> 01:30:45.665]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:30:45.665 --> 01:30:46.745]  And I got news for you.
[01:30:46.745 --> 01:30:48.086]  You're everyone else.
[01:30:48.086 --> 01:30:49.566]  Invisible Empire.

[01:31:21.374 --> 01:31:24.035]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.

[01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:52.630]  Thank you!
[01:31:59.724 --> 01:32:04.688]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:32:04.688 --> 01:32:05.688]  What have we got?
[01:32:05.688 --> 01:32:08.130]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:09.131]  A republic.
[01:32:09.131 --> 01:32:11.793]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:32:11.793 --> 01:32:14.055]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:32:14.055 --> 01:32:16.076]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:32:16.076 --> 01:32:17.757]  So they think they own our land?
[01:32:17.757 --> 01:32:19.078]  They think they own our water?
[01:32:19.078 --> 01:32:19.699]  Children?
[01:32:19.699 --> 01:32:20.800]  Our education?
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.640]  Our money?
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:25.283]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:32:25.643 --> 01:32:30.610]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:31.651]  We have the facts.
[01:32:31.651 --> 01:32:32.813]  We have the Constitution.
[01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:33.714]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:34.615]  We have common law.
[01:32:34.615 --> 01:32:37.119]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:37.119 --> 01:32:40.904]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:32:41.004 --> 01:32:45.966]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:32:45.966 --> 01:32:47.467]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:32:47.467 --> 01:32:48.547]  Don't tread on me.
[01:32:48.547 --> 01:32:54.970]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:33:10.917 --> 01:33:18.463]  Alright, let's do this.
[01:33:18.463 --> 01:33:24.047]  Let's take calls and then you have my word
[01:33:37.219 --> 01:33:44.861]  And I'm going to cover the economic news, the military news, the oil spill news, the incredible police state news.
[01:33:44.861 --> 01:33:46.862]  It just gets more and more wild by the minute.
[01:33:46.862 --> 01:33:49.743]  But we're going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:33:49.743 --> 01:34:00.767]  I first want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that I think are so essential for everyone out there to check out, because these are things everyone needs.
[01:34:00.767 --> 01:34:01.747]  You need storable food.
[01:34:03.086 --> 01:34:18.216]  And the best outfit out there, non-GMO, non-hybrid, all grown right here in America, except for the bananas, is efoodsdirect.com, and they're running a special until July 14th of free shipping, so all of your money goes towards food.
[01:34:18.216 --> 01:34:28.704]  And let me tell you, that's a substantive discount when somebody gives you free shipping in a food order, because obviously the shipping is normally high, because food weighs a lot.
[01:34:29.224 --> 01:34:31.145]  Check out their amazing line of foods.
[01:34:31.145 --> 01:34:35.847]  They've got ready-to-eat, they've got gourmet style, they've got special diets.
[01:34:35.847 --> 01:34:38.848]  This is the one-stop shop and they're patriots.
[01:34:38.848 --> 01:34:41.429]  The letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[01:34:41.429 --> 01:34:46.211]  Efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:34:46.211 --> 01:34:54.075]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't have to tell you that you need firearms, you need storable food, you need water filters, you need neighbors you can trust, you need family you can trust.
[01:34:55.037 --> 01:35:00.401]  And even if it's a one month supply of food, this stuff is highly portable.
[01:35:00.401 --> 01:35:04.264]  They've got it all at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:35:04.264 --> 01:35:06.966]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about is weapons-universe.com.
[01:35:09.312 --> 01:35:12.653]  These folks have everything you can imagine for your self-defense needs.
[01:35:12.653 --> 01:35:17.735]  You need to go to weapons-universe.com.
[01:35:17.735 --> 01:35:23.637]  Whether you need knives or stun guns, blow guns, collapsible batons, they have it all.
[01:35:23.637 --> 01:35:26.198]  They're patriots and great prices.
[01:35:26.198 --> 01:35:28.618]  Weapons-universe.com.
[01:35:28.618 --> 01:35:30.779]  They have authentic movie replica swords.
[01:35:30.779 --> 01:35:34.100]  I like that neat Conan the Barbarian one they sent me.
[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:35.861]  It's not a cheapo and it's made in Spain.
[01:35:36.661 --> 01:35:42.527]  You won't find a better selection with brand names like Cold Steel, Spyderco, and Smith & Wesson.
[01:35:42.527 --> 01:35:47.372]  Weapons-Universe.com has the largest selection and some of the best prices you'll find anywhere.
[01:35:47.372 --> 01:35:53.698]  Go to Weapons-Universe.com or click on the banner that's up on InfoWars.com today.
[01:35:53.698 --> 01:35:57.602]  And so again, I really want to thank those sponsors for making this broadcast possible.
[01:35:57.602 --> 01:35:58.764]  Okay, without further ado...
[01:36:01.237 --> 01:36:07.801]  Let's go right back to your phone call, see what you have to say out there on this July 5th, 2010 transmission.
[01:36:07.801 --> 01:36:09.722]  Julio in Illinois, thanks for holding.
[01:36:09.722 --> 01:36:10.022]  Welcome.
[01:36:11.235 --> 01:36:17.280]  Alex Jones, happy Independence Day to you, to one of the best patriots out there helping the cause.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.781]  Thank you, sir, for what you have done.
[01:36:18.781 --> 01:36:20.642]  Thank you.
[01:36:20.642 --> 01:36:21.443]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:36:21.443 --> 01:36:29.790]  I was at the case of Chicago yesterday and noticed a huge police state situation there.
[01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:33.492]  There were camouflaged-looking officers all over the place.
[01:36:33.492 --> 01:36:39.217]  There was Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Police Service.
[01:36:40.021 --> 01:36:45.648]  Oh, roaming through downtown, all over State Street, which is one of the busiest streets in downtown.
[01:36:45.648 --> 01:36:53.076]  Just a month ago, we got video of it, we're going to be posting it this week, the full report to PrisonPlanet.tv on top of it.
[01:36:54.011 --> 01:36:59.293]  There is the foreign troops from Eastern Europe training to take on domestic groups.
[01:36:59.293 --> 01:37:00.234]  We have it on video.
[01:37:00.234 --> 01:37:01.294]  We were there.
[01:37:01.294 --> 01:37:02.835]  I sent my crew up there.
[01:37:02.835 --> 01:37:04.035]  All part of the acclamation.
[01:37:04.035 --> 01:37:08.157]  But notice, the bigger the police state, the less secure you are.
[01:37:08.157 --> 01:37:09.858]  Total gun ban in Chicago.
[01:37:10.538 --> 01:37:13.080]  In fact, guys, I IM'd you this on Friday.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:16.522]  I don't know if you have it, but I forget the exact headline.
[01:37:16.522 --> 01:37:18.763]  I was telling my crew because I wanted to read it on air.
[01:37:18.763 --> 01:37:24.707]  It was something like, uh, Chicago, uh, you know, revises gun ban.
[01:37:24.707 --> 01:37:29.731]  And they were saying, ha, ha, ha, it'll still be almost impossible to get a gun.
[01:37:29.731 --> 01:37:32.853]  And everyone who has been convicted of a gun crime has to come register.
[01:37:33.733 --> 01:37:34.694]  I don't think so.
[01:37:52.072 --> 01:37:54.793]  Bragging about how he's going to still disarm people.
[01:37:54.793 --> 01:37:59.595]  There he is in a city that is more dangerous than many areas of Mexico.
[01:37:59.595 --> 01:38:06.538]  I mean, there's only one city in the United States that has collapsed as bad as Mexico into crime, and that's Chicago.
[01:38:06.538 --> 01:38:07.659]  And no one denies that.
[01:38:07.659 --> 01:38:11.701]  I was listening to Chicago-based radio last night for about an hour, being on the Beltway.
[01:38:12.721 --> 01:38:19.407]  Uh, as I was sitting there fishing and they were admitting, the host was admitting it is becoming just a hellhole of crime.
[01:38:19.407 --> 01:38:21.969]  Uh, but, uh, please continue, Julio.
[01:38:22.961 --> 01:38:25.723]  Yeah, the police state's pretty disgusting here.
[01:38:25.723 --> 01:38:34.548]  Actually, I was with a member of We Are Change Chicago, filming out of the police state stuff, and there was the American flag right near Congress Boulevard in downtown.
[01:38:34.548 --> 01:38:41.692]  Underneath the American flag was two great CCTV cameras, so that's great for our protection, big brother watching us.
[01:38:41.692 --> 01:38:45.755]  But my question to you is about Bill Gates and Bilderberg.
[01:38:45.755 --> 01:38:52.319]  You were talking about how, with Jim Tucker and others, how they gave the green light, pretty much, for an invasion of Iran.
[01:38:52.859 --> 01:39:08.652]  What I'm concerned about with Bill Gates, and I'm sure you're going to talk about this in your new Fall of the Republic eugenics film, is about that weather modification and how he and Melinda Gates are big on eugenics and vaccinations.
[01:39:08.652 --> 01:39:11.194]  Have you got any intel from your sources?
[01:39:12.455 --> 01:39:17.557]  We know Bilderberg well about how Bill Gates will be using any, like, weather modifications.
[01:39:17.557 --> 01:39:22.439]  I think Gerald Solente talked about the new Dust Bowl will be the BP oil spill.
[01:39:22.439 --> 01:39:34.244]  And now, you think they're going to talk about these record temperatures going on in the Northeast and all around the country, that this is global warming coming back and we need to have a cap-and-trade tax cuts for breathing?
[01:39:34.964 --> 01:39:39.207]  I'm sure you could talk for an hour on each one and so could I, but Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it was the Rockefeller founder.
[01:39:39.207 --> 01:39:39.767]  Now I knew that
[01:40:00.996 --> 01:40:12.420]  Over a hundred years ago, the banking families propagandized through the media and said, oh, yes, it's trust busting.
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:14.840]  We've got all these big monopolies.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:18.162]  And so you've punished us.
[01:40:18.162 --> 01:40:21.443]  Our companies are now going to be broken up.
[01:40:21.443 --> 01:40:28.745]  But what happened was the holdings that these elite families had basically went tax exempt and went into foundations.
[01:40:31.431 --> 01:40:38.927]  And I'd always known that the Rockefeller family basically created the modern environmental movement.
[01:40:38.927 --> 01:40:41.251]  I'd always known that they...
[01:40:42.762 --> 01:40:43.523]  We're good to go.
[01:41:04.645 --> 01:41:06.067]  Philanthropy.
[01:41:06.067 --> 01:41:07.829]  Oh, I'm a philanthropist.
[01:41:07.829 --> 01:41:12.374]  And that the Rockefellers didn't like people saying, hey, give your money to charity.
[01:41:12.374 --> 01:41:18.801]  Hey, you're so rich, worth billions and millions of dollars at the turn of the 20th century.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:28.262]  Over 100 years ago, and so they invented, you learn something every day, they invented philanthropy.
[01:41:28.262 --> 01:41:31.923]  Well, what do you see Bill and Melinda Gates doing with their 100 billion?
[01:41:31.923 --> 01:41:34.644]  What do you see Warren Buffett with his 80 billion?
[01:41:34.644 --> 01:41:35.984]  What do you see them doing?
[01:41:35.984 --> 01:41:48.528]  They put it in a tax-free foundation, and then only the interest on that money goes to their supposed
[01:41:53.118 --> 01:41:55.800]  Social endeavor.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.861]  And then they keep all their assets tax-free.
[01:41:58.861 --> 01:42:04.965]  It is a huge unfair trade advantage, business advantage, because everybody else is having to pay taxes.
[01:42:04.965 --> 01:42:11.728]  And that's why you read in the memoirs of the Astors and others, even recently they'll brag, what, taxes?
[01:42:11.728 --> 01:42:13.810]  That's for little people.
[01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:16.051]  See, you pay taxes, they don't.
[01:42:17.259 --> 01:42:24.888]  And yes, most of what Bill and Melinda Gates spend their money on is eugenics, is population reduction, and...
[01:42:26.604 --> 01:42:32.926]  The second biggest area that I've noticed Bill and Melinda Gates are now involved in is weather modification.
[01:42:32.926 --> 01:42:34.527]  And I'm sure most of you have seen that.
[01:42:34.527 --> 01:42:35.747]  It's been all over the news.
[01:42:35.747 --> 01:42:37.608]  Oh, isn't Bill Gates nice?
[01:42:37.608 --> 01:42:42.029]  He's invested billions of dollars in stopping hurricanes.
[01:42:42.029 --> 01:42:45.230]  He's invested billions of dollars in weather control.
[01:42:45.230 --> 01:42:51.352]  He has all these patents and oh, he wants a new government agency to be created to fund this.
[01:42:51.352 --> 01:42:53.693]  Yeah, to fund him.
[01:42:53.693 --> 01:42:55.274]  He'll control the Weather Bureau.
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:58.781]  The Bill & Melinda Gates Weather Control.
[01:42:58.781 --> 01:43:02.483]  You know, this sunny day, brought to you by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:43:02.483 --> 01:43:05.605]  This is what our grandkids are gonna be listening to.
[01:43:05.605 --> 01:43:08.686]  It turns out that in the early 60s, the U.S.
[01:43:08.686 --> 01:43:19.552]  government was controlling, speeding them up, making them weaker, making them stronger, killing them, directing them, steering them, hurricanes.
[01:43:19.552 --> 01:43:21.933]  And in 1967, the Stanford Research Institute
[01:43:23.334 --> 01:43:36.777]  And of course, the Naval War Laboratory headed up at that time by Ben Livingston did certify that they had complete control over the weather.
[01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:39.418]  And so, yes, they are manipulating the weather.
[01:43:39.418 --> 01:43:42.199]  Now, what's manipulated and what isn't?
[01:43:42.199 --> 01:43:46.100]  Once they start changing the weather in one spot, that changes the weather forever.
[01:43:46.994 --> 01:43:51.776]  Though probably in small ways, who knows what chain reactions they could be creating.
[01:43:51.776 --> 01:43:55.398]  You know, that's really the problem at the end of the day, is that globalists are all about data.
[01:43:55.398 --> 01:43:58.239]  They're all about controlling information.
[01:43:58.239 --> 01:44:00.100]  They're all about understanding systems.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:05.462]  But to do that, they engage in massive tests, massive experiments.
[01:44:05.462 --> 01:44:14.506]  And we are all taking part in genetic engineering experiments, in toxic experiments being poisoned, in weather control experiments,
[01:44:15.931 --> 01:44:21.273]  And Bill and Melinda Gates are developing viruses that go in and reprogram your brain.
[01:44:21.273 --> 01:44:26.055]  And I've been warning you about that for a decade at least, but now it's mainstream news.
[01:44:26.055 --> 01:44:28.336]  And you just wake up and you're not who you were before.
[01:44:28.336 --> 01:44:30.737]  And that's the type of enemy we face.
[01:44:30.737 --> 01:44:32.117]  And they've already got all this stuff.
[01:44:32.117 --> 01:44:33.338]  They admit they do.
[01:44:33.338 --> 01:44:34.538]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[01:44:34.538 --> 01:44:36.199]  That's why they don't care.
[01:44:36.199 --> 01:44:36.919]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:44.604]  And you try to talk to some steroid head cop about this information, they're just gonna laugh, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:44.604 --> 01:44:46.505]  If it wasn't on American Idol, they're not gonna listen.
[01:44:46.505 --> 01:44:49.767]  If you try to talk to your dumb neighbor, they're not gonna listen.
[01:44:49.767 --> 01:45:02.836]  You try to talk to the average American, even though they don't like being screwed by the government and they know things are getting worse and worse, they still just don't realize how serious it is.
[01:45:02.836 --> 01:45:04.157]  And I love America.
[01:45:05.714 --> 01:45:07.539]  And I love the good people that are in this country.
[01:45:07.539 --> 01:45:09.183]  I mean, it's a mix.
[01:45:09.183 --> 01:45:14.056]  People say, well, the ugly Americans, you know, the rude Americans overseas when they see how we behave.
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:18.462]  How we're wealthy and take it for granted.
[01:45:18.462 --> 01:45:28.907]  How we're into pettiness and style and I mean that's really looked down upon by classy people.
[01:45:28.907 --> 01:45:30.868]  We are creatures of the corporate board.
[01:45:30.868 --> 01:45:34.290]  We're creatures of whatever the system is selling us.
[01:45:34.290 --> 01:45:36.871]  We dress like clowns.
[01:45:36.871 --> 01:45:39.193]  We're a joke.
[01:45:39.193 --> 01:45:41.714]  And it's easy for people that have never had it good to see that.
[01:45:44.505 --> 01:45:45.686]  And I'm saying I'm a joke.
[01:45:45.686 --> 01:45:48.147]  I mean, I'm not up here judging anybody.
[01:45:48.147 --> 01:45:54.472]  We are the children of decadent people, who are the children of decadent people, who are the children of decadent people.
[01:45:54.472 --> 01:46:09.481]  Now, sure, you take somebody on average born a hundred years ago, they were a lot more polite, a lot harder working, a lot more honorable, statistically, historically.
[01:46:09.481 --> 01:46:12.163]  I'm not saying you are a bad person individually.
[01:46:12.163 --> 01:46:13.224]  I'm just saying on average,
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.082]  But it's more than just the fact that we're decadent.
[01:46:17.082 --> 01:46:23.447]  We are, we're poisoned.
[01:46:23.447 --> 01:46:26.629]  We're chemically blunted.
[01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:34.015]  We're in a big giant science experiment with a bunch of control freaks that think they're God doing really bad things to everybody.
[01:46:34.015 --> 01:46:35.196]  And it's all real.
[01:46:35.196 --> 01:46:42.422]  I mean, CNN admits they put silicon in chicken McNuggets, a petrochemical that's admittedly toxic.
[01:46:45.618 --> 01:46:47.278]  Everything gets tested on us.
[01:46:47.278 --> 01:46:51.299]  That's illegal everywhere in the world, but here.
[01:46:51.299 --> 01:46:55.120]  The GMO crops we're fed are illegal everywhere in the world, but here.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.220]  We are a joke, okay?
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:00.220]  Now, I'll admit I'm a joke.
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:01.381]  I don't wanna be a joke.
[01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:06.382]  I wanna... I'm gonna go to Gil Hung Up.
[01:47:06.382 --> 01:47:08.382]  I'm gonna go to Brian, Eric, Laura, and others.
[01:47:08.382 --> 01:47:09.162]  No, Gil didn't hang up.
[01:47:09.162 --> 01:47:11.422]  He's just at the end of the line there.
[01:47:11.422 --> 01:47:14.723]  And see, that caller calls in, and he brings up such heavy subjects.
[01:47:21.044 --> 01:47:23.626]  I just realized my children don't have much future.
[01:47:23.626 --> 01:47:27.990]  And that's a really scary thing to face up to.
[01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:30.633]  But I know this, I can't stop living.
[01:47:30.633 --> 01:47:33.055]  I can't stop my will to live.
[01:47:33.055 --> 01:47:35.537]  I can't stop my life force.
[01:47:35.537 --> 01:47:46.406]  And the fact that my instincts and my spirit, everything I am, is driving me forward to explore, to trailblaze, to continue to live.
[01:47:46.406 --> 01:47:47.928]  Just living is a victory.
[01:47:49.485 --> 01:47:55.287]  For our ancestors, thousands of years ago, just surviving was victory.
[01:47:55.287 --> 01:48:01.569]  Just having children, and enough of the children surviving to have children, that was winning, and that's still winning.
[01:48:01.569 --> 01:48:03.389]  And the globalists boil everything down to that.
[01:48:03.389 --> 01:48:05.010]  They understand that's winning.
[01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:14.953]  That's why they've got a plan, through banking fraud, to bankrupt almost everyone so that you're now under their control, and so your government's under their control, so they can then kill you.
[01:48:16.226 --> 01:48:22.748]  Because when you don't exist anymore, and your children don't exist anymore, they have full spectrum dominance.
[01:48:22.748 --> 01:48:28.630]  And they debate whether they're going to keep less than a million people, or whether they should have 500 million.
[01:48:28.630 --> 01:48:33.832]  And they put out white papers, and have debates that we've covered and linked to.
[01:48:33.832 --> 01:48:39.954]  They have hundreds and hundreds of public debates, and they laugh at you in the debates and know you're not even interested.
[01:48:39.954 --> 01:48:42.195]  And they say because you're not interested, you deserve to die.
[01:48:45.506 --> 01:49:02.675]  I mean I don't like a bunch of control freaks messing with my water and my food and talking about how I don't deserve to live and how they plan to kill me and how they're slowly killing all of us to where we die of degenerative diseases.
[01:49:02.675 --> 01:49:12.781]  Most of us are now sterile or almost sterile and I sit around recognizing it and I'm here on the radio and I'm talking about it and we have radio breaks and I have
[01:49:12.901 --> 01:49:13.741]  You see what I'm talking about?
[01:49:13.741 --> 01:49:15.862]  More and more I think I should just do one video a day
[01:49:44.122 --> 01:49:47.684]  And cover the important issues for 10 minutes, and then that's it.
[01:49:47.684 --> 01:49:49.645]  That's all there is.
[01:49:49.645 --> 01:49:59.289]  But no, to attack this system, I had to attack it through its structure, through its infrastructure, through the way it was set up.
[01:49:59.289 --> 01:50:00.630]  And I guess that's what a fish does.
[01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:05.773]  It follows the stream, it follows the river, it follows out to the lakes and then to the big sea.
[01:50:07.978 --> 01:50:10.620]  You know, I'm totally for real.
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:14.342]  And I believe the things I'm saying, and I know what I'm saying is real.
[01:50:14.342 --> 01:50:20.426]  And to be quite honest with you, I take off two days, which is a long time for me, two days straight.
[01:50:20.426 --> 01:50:27.851]  And... I'm blasted right now.
[01:50:27.851 --> 01:50:35.556]  I don't get all excited and happy when I see an article in the London Telegraph where they admit the government kidnaps children for no reason to fill quotas.
[01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:40.431]  They're picking them by hair color and eye color.
[01:50:40.431 --> 01:50:42.792]  Fifteen years ago, I'd get excited about an article like that.
[01:50:42.792 --> 01:50:45.113]  Like, oh, I get to expose the evil.
[01:50:45.113 --> 01:50:49.314]  You know, this will show people how evil the system is.
[01:50:49.314 --> 01:50:52.796]  And then I realized, wait a minute, no, this is just part of acclimation.
[01:50:52.796 --> 01:50:55.196]  Okay, the government kidnaps kids for no reason.
[01:50:55.196 --> 01:50:56.937]  Okay, they ship narcotics in.
[01:50:56.937 --> 01:50:58.478]  Okay, they're poison in the water.
[01:50:58.478 --> 01:50:59.558]  Okay, they're growing the opium.
[01:51:00.933 --> 01:51:02.254]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.254 --> 01:51:07.838]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.838 --> 01:51:12.861]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.861 --> 01:51:18.425]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.425 --> 01:51:20.246]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:20.526 --> 01:51:21.026]  We're good to go!
[01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:51.512]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:51.512 --> 01:51:57.617]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.617 --> 01:51:59.999]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.834 --> 01:52:04.216]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.216 --> 01:52:08.119]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:08.119 --> 01:52:11.841]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:52:11.841 --> 01:52:18.726]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[01:52:18.786 --> 01:52:19.267]  I think so.
[01:52:33.843 --> 01:52:34.363]  That's right.
[01:53:00.663 --> 01:53:09.072]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:53:09.072 --> 01:53:12.616]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:06.732]  All right, Barney in Texas.
[01:54:06.732 --> 01:54:07.893]  You're on the air, Barney.
[01:54:09.264 --> 01:54:11.465]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:54:11.465 --> 01:54:13.266]  I've been listening to you since November.
[01:54:13.266 --> 01:54:20.770]  A friend of mine sent me a text on Obama Deception and ever since then I've been watching all your videos and finding out what's been going on in the world.
[01:54:20.770 --> 01:54:27.214]  I wanted to give you two quick solutions and then a really good news report.
[01:54:27.214 --> 01:54:33.397]  One thing, I'm a Prison Planet subscriber.
[01:54:33.397 --> 01:54:33.937]  Thank you, sir.
[01:54:33.937 --> 01:54:35.578]  I couldn't do it without you.
[01:54:35.578 --> 01:54:38.620]  Yeah, I just think I wanted to encourage all the other listeners, kind of like
[01:54:39.722 --> 01:54:43.347]  If all the Christians tithe, then we'd be able to change the world.
[01:54:43.347 --> 01:54:52.860]  But, you know, all we have to do is stop buying Starbucks and McDonald's and movies and everyone can... Oh, I think all your listeners could afford $5 or $6 a month to support you.
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:57.005]  I would like... If Michael Moore is allowed to get his films in the theaters, I think...
[01:54:57.873 --> 01:55:01.074]  We should be able to support you so you can do that.
[01:55:16.298 --> 01:55:17.199]  And they know that.
[01:55:17.199 --> 01:55:26.104]  They know we are starting to endanger them, and that's why they're now trying to openly shut down the internet, and why they're demonizing their competition.
[01:55:26.104 --> 01:55:27.705]  That's actually good news.
[01:55:27.705 --> 01:55:34.489]  The establishment would just be ignoring us and others if we weren't having an effect, Barney, so that's a really good point.
[01:55:34.489 --> 01:55:36.210]  People always ask me, well, what are solutions?
[01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:38.512]  Well, states' rights, 10th Amendment,
[01:55:40.032 --> 01:55:46.597]  Getting healthy, getting informed, calling for criminal charges against the bankers.
[01:55:46.597 --> 01:55:56.523]  But the biggest thing is, if nobody points out that BP is clearly involved in a false flag here, if nobody points out that Obama is blocking the aid effort here, then no one will know that.
[01:55:56.523 --> 01:56:01.146]  So it really is the perception issue.
[01:56:01.146 --> 01:56:04.969]  We've got to counter the establishment's lies with the truth.
[01:56:04.969 --> 01:56:05.229]  Go ahead.
[01:56:05.998 --> 01:56:18.147]  Yeah, there's so many of us that, you know, believe what you're saying and we see, you know, been woken up, but the simplest thing we can do is to support somebody who's out there on the front lines, um, doing it because in our daily lives we get so busy.
[01:56:18.147 --> 01:56:22.831]  So we, you know, at the end of our 60 or 70 years on this earth, there's only so much we can do.
[01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:29.476]  But if we support somebody in a very practical way, then we can get the message out because it's really hard to talk to.
[01:56:29.476 --> 01:56:31.638]  I work in Hispanic media.
[01:56:31.638 --> 01:56:33.339]  It's hard to talk to educated or, uh,
[01:56:35.003 --> 01:56:36.143]  Middle class people.
[01:56:36.143 --> 01:56:42.105]  I live in the suburbs of Dallas and it's like you can't really get a conversation going because there's so much information.
[01:56:42.105 --> 01:56:47.146]  They think they kind of treat you like like you're crazy or whatever like your conspiracy theorist.
[01:56:47.146 --> 01:56:53.007]  But whenever I've seen my friends actually watch the videos, your videos, then they get it.
[01:56:53.007 --> 01:56:55.448]  So that's why people Barney.
[01:56:55.448 --> 01:56:58.749]  I mean, this is probably the no exaggeration.
[01:57:00.114 --> 01:57:15.490]  The third, fourth, I don't know, 5,000 times, because it happens hundreds of times a year, where people on air as callers and in emails and on the street say, I couldn't wake my father or my mother or my son or my daughter up or my boss or my employer or my pastor.
[01:57:16.471 --> 01:57:18.954]  I couldn't wake my rabbi up, whatever the case is.
[01:57:18.954 --> 01:57:26.223]  I couldn't wake my imam up until I gave them Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Terror Storm.
[01:57:26.223 --> 01:57:31.990]  And the films really are the most important work I do because the radio show is informative.
[01:57:32.891 --> 01:57:55.623]  The news websites are informative, but the films, I'm really able to give people a full spectrum breakdown, and with that nugget of information, they're able to really then wake themselves and others up, and that's why PrisonPlanet.tv is so important, because people can then download the shows, the radio interviews, the video interviews, all the films, and burn them to disk,
[01:57:56.323 --> 01:57:57.684]  And I wanted to give you a good report.
[01:57:57.684 --> 01:58:00.505]  My brother, Tim Donnelly, he lives in California in the 59th District.
[01:58:00.505 --> 01:58:03.747]  That's San Bernardino County and part, half of Los Angeles County.
[01:58:03.747 --> 01:58:07.229]  He, just three months ago, he's a patriot, he was actually in 05, one of the founding
[01:58:26.025 --> 01:58:28.127]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:28.127 --> 01:58:31.329]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.199 --> 01:58:54.742]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:54.742 --> 01:58:55.662]  Number 1.
[01:58:55.662 --> 01:58:59.084]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.084 --> 01:58:59.945]  Number 2.
[01:58:59.945 --> 01:59:04.828]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:04.828 --> 01:59:05.588]  It's true.
[01:59:05.588 --> 01:59:10.451]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.451 --> 01:59:11.272]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.272 --> 01:59:14.874]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:14.874 --> 01:59:18.777]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:18.777 --> 01:59:19.037]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.557 --> 01:59:22.320]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:26.805]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.805 --> 01:59:30.950]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:35.716]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:35.996 --> 01:59:40.158]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.158 --> 01:59:41.959]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.959 --> 01:59:44.200]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:46.801]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:46.801 --> 01:59:47.802]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:47.802 --> 01:59:49.022]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:16.934]  Alright, we've got a long way to go and a short time to get there and I promised to start getting into more of the news and breaking it down
[02:00:35.342 --> 02:00:46.730]  And I will do that as soon as I've talked to Barney, Brian, Eric, Laura, and Gil, at least that group of callers that have been holding the longest.
[02:00:46.730 --> 02:00:53.595]  And then I'm getting into the news, and let me tell you, the news says a lot.
[02:00:53.595 --> 02:01:01.541]  The news says more with a story than what is just on the surface.
[02:01:01.541 --> 02:01:04.823]  The fact that the mainstream media admits we're now in a depression,
[02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:12.972]  That's bad.
[02:01:12.972 --> 02:01:14.573]  That's why I haven't covered it in two hours.
[02:01:14.573 --> 02:01:20.656]  A issue this big.
[02:01:20.656 --> 02:01:22.718]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:01:22.718 --> 02:01:28.421]  We're going to have a 20 year long depression.
[02:01:28.421 --> 02:01:29.902]  And at the end of that, it only gets worse.
[02:01:32.025 --> 02:01:37.590]  The globalists are destroying our society right in front of us and they're getting away with it.
[02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:46.919]  Yeah, a lot of people are getting upset and are waking up and, oh, Alex Jones is bigger than ever and growing exponentially and so what?
[02:01:46.919 --> 02:01:51.002]  I feel like a sack of crap.
[02:01:51.002 --> 02:01:54.806]  And I shouldn't even get up here on air and say that.
[02:01:54.806 --> 02:01:56.868]  It's not that I can't handle the responsibility.
[02:01:58.826 --> 02:02:06.290]  It's just that I cannot believe that I'm in this position, and it makes my brain hurt to focus on it.
[02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:07.251]  I don't know how to explain it.
[02:02:07.251 --> 02:02:08.472]  I'm just sick of it.
[02:02:08.472 --> 02:02:10.653]  I'm sick of looking at Barack Obama.
[02:02:10.653 --> 02:02:12.674]  I'm sick of looking at the Republicans.
[02:02:12.674 --> 02:02:16.476]  I'm sick of looking at the heads of these oil companies and these bankers.
[02:02:16.476 --> 02:02:22.960]  Mousetongues on the Infowars.com front page makes me want to throw up looking at that demonic chipmunk.
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:25.982]  I'm just sick of thugs and trash and liars.
[02:02:25.982 --> 02:02:27.063]  I want them out of my life!
[02:02:29.315 --> 02:02:35.596]  And I can't believe how stupid people are out there that serve this system who love petty power trips.
[02:02:35.596 --> 02:02:36.516]  I just don't like evil.
[02:02:36.516 --> 02:02:39.277]  I'm going to be flat out honest with you.
[02:02:39.277 --> 02:02:42.177]  And I can't believe that I'm a good guy.
[02:02:42.177 --> 02:02:48.878]  I always grew up thinking I was bad and that I was evil because I had bad thoughts and I was aggressive.
[02:02:48.878 --> 02:02:51.899]  But that's just being a man.
[02:02:51.899 --> 02:02:56.540]  At least I'm not a snake who stabs people in the back.
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:57.040]  I'm sorry.
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:58.160]  I said I'm going to take your calls.
[02:03:02.549 --> 02:03:03.929]  America is dying, folks.
[02:03:03.929 --> 02:03:04.950]  I don't know how else to say it.
[02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:10.811]  I can't hardly do the show.
[02:03:10.811 --> 02:03:11.811]  Barney, we've got about a minute and a half.
[02:03:11.811 --> 02:03:12.692]  I'm going to come back with our callers.
[02:03:12.692 --> 02:03:13.452]  Finish up your points.
[02:03:13.452 --> 02:03:19.033]  You're saying somebody you know just won a primary with only twenty-something thousand dollars.
[02:03:19.033 --> 02:03:24.014]  Everybody who's seen as an incumbent or as an establishment person is losing.
[02:03:24.014 --> 02:03:25.455]  Everyone who's seen as a patriot
[02:03:27.673 --> 02:03:35.014]  I want to let you know that it is.
[02:03:35.014 --> 02:03:42.116]  He was one of the founding members of the Minutemen movement, which was to get the attention, the national attention, on the problem of the border, which it did.
[02:03:42.116 --> 02:03:44.716]  The media, of course, spinned it and played the race card.
[02:03:44.716 --> 02:03:48.037]  I work in Hispanic media and speak Spanish, so I saw that happen.
[02:03:48.037 --> 02:03:52.097]  I would hear the stories from him and then see it on the news, and it was totally different.
[02:03:52.097 --> 02:03:55.278]  But either way, three months ago, he decided he got fed up.
[02:03:56.252 --> 02:04:14.406]  Only three months before the primary, he decided to run, and there's 500,000 people in that district, which is part of Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County, and there's only 80 districts in California, so it's kind of, the other, the closest opponent spent $160,000, and the establishment opponent who got all the
[02:04:17.705 --> 02:04:18.486]  I agree with you.
[02:04:18.486 --> 02:04:19.046]  I agree with you.
[02:04:19.046 --> 02:04:21.387]  And people have got to see themselves as the leader.
[02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:23.669]  It doesn't mean you have all the answers.
[02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:26.410]  It doesn't mean you're not going to make mistakes.
[02:04:26.410 --> 02:04:28.872]  It's just you've got to get up and take action.
[02:04:44.201 --> 02:04:44.882]  Great call.
[02:04:44.882 --> 02:04:46.704]  I appreciate that information.
[02:04:46.704 --> 02:04:49.368]  Barney, send me the contact info for that person.
[02:04:49.368 --> 02:04:50.950]  I'd like to get them on.
[02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:53.593]  Brian, Eric, Laura, Gil, others, your calls are straight ahead.

[02:07:01.616 --> 02:07:05.577]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:05.577 --> 02:07:14.438]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:14.438 --> 02:07:19.079]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:19.079 --> 02:07:29.881]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:30.521 --> 02:07:40.043]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:40.043 --> 02:07:45.465]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:45.465 --> 02:07:52.946]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:52.946 --> 02:07:55.707]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:01.966 --> 02:08:10.269]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.269 --> 02:08:18.752]  Okay, the last two hours of this July 5th, 2010, Monday edition are simulcasting right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:18.752 --> 02:08:30.877]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the next two hours, and we're going to cover a ton of news, like Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[02:08:32.585 --> 02:08:34.966]  That's what we've been telling you for two years.
[02:08:34.966 --> 02:08:39.447]  It took them two to three years to admit they were in a depression in 1929 and 1933.
[02:08:39.447 --> 02:08:43.968]  The same bankers ran that scam.
[02:08:43.968 --> 02:08:45.508]  So we're gonna break that down.
[02:08:45.508 --> 02:08:46.429]  Also, with the U.S.
[02:08:46.429 --> 02:08:50.570]  trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:51.410]  London Telegraph.
[02:08:51.410 --> 02:08:53.211]  You know about the New York Times last week.
[02:08:53.211 --> 02:08:55.391]  The Third Depression.
[02:08:55.391 --> 02:08:58.392]  Why are they suddenly all reporting the truth?
[02:08:59.639 --> 02:09:07.262]  The truth so far, so far as, yeah, we're really in a depression, but not who's behind it, how do we get out of it?
[02:09:07.262 --> 02:09:14.105]  How do we bring those behind it to justice so that they don't keep doing it in the future?
[02:09:14.105 --> 02:09:19.687]  I'm gonna go to your calls, but I wanna just say this simply and succinctly right now, and I'm gonna get back into it later.
[02:09:19.687 --> 02:09:23.849]  It isn't enough to throw out every incumbent.
[02:09:23.849 --> 02:09:25.950]  It isn't enough to just
[02:09:27.584 --> 02:09:33.810]  Educate yourself on the fact that there is a world government and there are offshore private banks that are robbing us.
[02:09:33.810 --> 02:09:50.786]  People have to also really grow up and face the facts, even if it is horrifying, that the controllers of this planet are eugenicists and that they are poisoning our water and our food and our air by design
[02:09:52.711 --> 02:09:59.479]  To introduce chemicals and toxins into our food chain that will lower
[02:10:01.078 --> 02:10:15.928]  Our standard of living, our quality of life, that will cause degenerative diseases that they can then make money off of treating them in the future, and that will ultimately basically sterilize the majority of the population.
[02:10:15.928 --> 02:10:20.471]  This is their stated goal, and this is clearly what they are doing.
[02:10:20.471 --> 02:10:23.153]  All right, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[02:10:23.153 --> 02:10:24.694]  Let's talk to Brian in Tennessee.
[02:10:24.694 --> 02:10:25.815]  Go ahead, Brian, thanks for holding.
[02:10:26.994 --> 02:10:28.315]  Hey Alex, how's it going, buddy?
[02:10:28.315 --> 02:10:30.135]  Good, sir.
[02:10:30.135 --> 02:10:35.078]  I just wanted to, I don't have any information about the Gulf, but I have something important.
[02:10:35.078 --> 02:10:42.381]  I want to talk to you about the Patriot Act, which will definitely come into effect if they start evacuating millions of people and seizing guns.
[02:10:42.381 --> 02:10:48.444]  Yesterday I was laying in bed, I was reading the Constitution, and I couldn't believe it.
[02:10:48.444 --> 02:10:55.107]  My jaw fell out when I was reading the 10th Amendment, and then I looked at the 9th Amendment,
[02:10:56.096 --> 02:11:07.582]  And it just suddenly dawned on me that the Patriot Act is no more genuine than a $3 bill.
[02:11:07.582 --> 02:11:22.850]  The only reason that the thing can exist is because most of the American people are ignorant of their rights in the Constitution, and they're intimidated, and they don't question anything, but on its own legs, it's not a valid law.
[02:11:25.551 --> 02:11:32.434]  For instance, in the Fourth Amendment, you know, it talks about how you can't have any unlawful searches and seizures.
[02:11:32.434 --> 02:11:38.876]  And the Patriot Act obviously extends more of that to the government, to where they can come into your house.
[02:11:38.876 --> 02:11:45.638]  And the system lied and said that sneak and peek and all the rest of that wouldn't be used on citizens.
[02:11:45.638 --> 02:11:49.460]  And it has been, and now they use it in regular law enforcement.
[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:52.221]  Absolutely, it was written for the American people.
[02:11:53.061 --> 02:11:59.516]  And the Patriot Act conservatively nullifies five of the ten articles in the Bill of Rights.
[02:12:00.526 --> 02:12:04.387]  But it says plainly, here's the thing, this is what's so crazy.
[02:12:04.387 --> 02:12:16.509]  It says in the Ninth Amendment, the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[02:12:16.509 --> 02:12:22.831]  So you cannot take any of the rights in the Constitution from the people.
[02:12:22.831 --> 02:12:24.751]  It's there in plain black and white.
[02:12:24.751 --> 02:12:28.292]  The Ninth Amendment is probably the most important amendment there.
[02:12:30.029 --> 02:12:47.146]  And the 10th Amendment just further expounds on it and says the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.
[02:12:47.839 --> 02:12:50.060]  So, I mean, I don't understand.
[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:51.320]  It's so cut and dry.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:53.401]  How can we listen?
[02:12:53.401 --> 02:12:58.243]  Listen, it's cut and dry that the government can't just say we'll kill U.S.
[02:12:58.243 --> 02:13:06.826]  citizens anywhere we want in the United States or worldwide if someone in the Pentagon or White House thinks they might be a terrorist.
[02:13:08.046 --> 02:13:10.188]  And people say, well, we gotta get tough on the terrorists.
[02:13:10.188 --> 02:13:13.411]  Then you go research who the terrorists are.
[02:13:13.411 --> 02:13:17.955]  99% of the time, literally, it is a staged government event.
[02:13:17.955 --> 02:13:25.121]  And of course you don't let the government just arrest and take away anybody they want to a dungeon.
[02:13:25.121 --> 02:13:35.930]  I mean, of course that's the greatest threat, not some turbaned guy who wants to blow up a school, even if that turbaned guy actually exists, which in most cases they don't.
[02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:48.676]  There is some real Muslim terrorists out there from the research I've done, but most of it is government, and most of the real stuff is basically copycat from the government stuff.
[02:13:48.676 --> 02:13:53.499]  And this is an elementary statement you're making, Brian, but it's also very profound.
[02:13:53.499 --> 02:13:58.461]  That's why I'm dumbfounded so much, is this is openly treason.
[02:13:58.461 --> 02:14:01.222]  It is openly criminal.
[02:14:01.222 --> 02:14:04.304]  But the government knows they're doing that.
[02:14:04.304 --> 02:14:05.865]  I mean, listen, having the military,
[02:14:06.894 --> 02:14:09.995]  Running checkpoints all over the country with local police.
[02:14:09.995 --> 02:14:12.796]  And training with foreign troops to take on the American people.
[02:14:12.796 --> 02:14:18.418]  And the federal government secretly training tens of thousands of preachers, now on record.
[02:14:18.418 --> 02:14:20.079]  This was secret when we first reported it.
[02:14:20.079 --> 02:14:26.301]  Now it's, oh yes, the government's working secretly with preachers to prepare their flocks to go to FEMA camps.
[02:14:26.301 --> 02:14:28.001]  I mean, how creepy is that?
[02:14:28.001 --> 02:14:32.923]  If you go watch The Running Man from the mid-1980s, it's like, where's my brother?
[02:14:33.183 --> 02:14:35.484]  Oh, he was permanently detained.
[02:14:35.484 --> 02:14:47.471]  You go watch Firefox, like I said in the first hour with Clint Eastwood, from the late 1970s, and he goes to visit Russia, and they search his bags, and he's shocked by the incredible police state.
[02:14:47.471 --> 02:14:52.134]  I mean, again, we are living in the Soviet Union.
[02:14:52.134 --> 02:14:54.235]  And so, secret arrest is being promoted.
[02:14:55.327 --> 02:14:57.208]  Shutting down free speech is being promoted.
[02:14:57.208 --> 02:14:59.889]  Taking everybody's bank accounts.
[02:14:59.889 --> 02:15:01.749]  Not giving people money.
[02:15:01.749 --> 02:15:05.891]  In the last week, I've seen all these mainstream media reports put it out there.
[02:15:05.891 --> 02:15:12.013]  Oh, I guess the health care bill didn't cover pre-existing conditions and those with really bad conditions.
[02:15:12.013 --> 02:15:15.135]  Oh, it does cut your benefits and raise your taxes.
[02:15:16.295 --> 02:15:26.119]  And see, they don't care if you find out Obama's a liar and his approval rating, you know, drops, like the approval rating of gonorrhea, because they'll just put a new puppet in.
[02:15:26.119 --> 02:15:34.322]  This was all meant to happen, all, and the whole fake debate, I mean, and to see our fellow Americans buying this hook, line, and sinker.
[02:15:34.322 --> 02:15:35.042]  Anything else, Brian?
[02:15:36.146 --> 02:15:37.547]  Yes, sir.
[02:15:37.547 --> 02:15:54.758]  My frustration is much like yours, but it seems to me, I mean, am I wrong in saying that the power from these so-called laws and acts, like the Patriot Act, they get their power from the ignorance of the 99% of the American people?
[02:15:54.758 --> 02:16:04.704]  In other words, if 300 million Americans realized the 9th and 10th Amendments and what they meant, that the Patriot Act would simply just fall apart like a house of cards?
[02:16:04.924 --> 02:16:05.385]  Exactly.
[02:16:05.385 --> 02:16:06.346]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:06.346 --> 02:16:13.276]  That's why I had the idea and threw it out over eight years ago on air and then others picked it up and ran with it.
[02:16:13.276 --> 02:16:14.878]  And that's the power of this show.
[02:16:14.878 --> 02:16:17.201]  We have great guests with really great ideas.
[02:16:17.201 --> 02:16:20.186]  We have wonderful callers with just amazing ideas.
[02:16:22.336 --> 02:16:33.050]  And if any one of you out there can just implement these ideas in your town, in your city, in your state, then it is a model for the rest of the country and the world.
[02:16:33.050 --> 02:16:35.593]  That's why they're so scared of anyone standing up.
[02:16:35.593 --> 02:16:37.335]  That's why they want to make you feel powerless.
[02:16:38.567 --> 02:16:47.593]  And I had the idea of having the states, via the 9th and 10th Amendment, nullify the Patriot Act, and we couldn't get that done, so I said, how about counties and cities?
[02:16:47.593 --> 02:16:58.800]  And then other people picked up the idea, and over 800 cities and four states passed laws against the Patriot Act, and we stood up and said, no, this is unconstitutional.
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:03.543]  Then that gave moral support to courts, who've stood up and said it's unconstitutional.
[02:17:05.074 --> 02:17:06.315]  Okay.
[02:17:06.315 --> 02:17:07.777]  And so it's always a struggle.
[02:17:07.777 --> 02:17:10.880]  The tyrant's always wanting your freedoms.
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:15.544]  And you're always having to stand up and secure those freedoms.
[02:17:15.544 --> 02:17:17.526]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[02:17:17.526 --> 02:17:19.928]  I mean, what does the Bill of Rights talk about?
[02:17:19.928 --> 02:17:22.530]  Well, we've gotten our country, we've gotten our Constitution.
[02:17:22.530 --> 02:17:24.933]  Now we need to secure that with this Bill of Rights.
[02:17:27.947 --> 02:17:29.969]  I mean, do you lock your house when you go out of town?
[02:17:29.969 --> 02:17:30.609]  Do you secure?
[02:17:30.609 --> 02:17:35.853]  Do you put your child in a safety seat in a car to try to secure them?
[02:17:35.853 --> 02:17:42.499]  Do you stop smoking cigarettes so you secure that you won't die of lung cancer?
[02:17:42.499 --> 02:17:46.582]  Again, you can't just go to the bar every day after work and get drunk and be free.
[02:17:46.582 --> 02:17:51.606]  There are crooks who will take over government that has the power to rob your butt.
[02:17:51.606 --> 02:17:52.927]  Let's go to Eric in California.
[02:17:52.927 --> 02:17:55.509]  You're on the air, Eric.
[02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:56.170]  Hey, Alex.
[02:17:56.170 --> 02:17:56.490]  Hey, buddy.
[02:17:57.611 --> 02:18:07.735]  Hey, long time listener, sometime contributor, I'm not a Prison Planet member, but I do buy every one of your videos and I do support your sponsors.
[02:18:07.735 --> 02:18:08.275]  Thank you.
[02:18:08.275 --> 02:18:10.977]  One of which, one of which, guess it, Jeans.
[02:18:10.977 --> 02:18:20.060]  And let me just tell you, after being a lifelong Levi's wearer, my boys couldn't be happier, if you know what I mean.
[02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:21.701]  The Kikis are comfortable.
[02:18:21.701 --> 02:18:23.442]  Okay, so what else is on your mind, sir?
[02:18:24.542 --> 02:18:31.063]  Hey, buddy, I was just awoken this morning, July 5th, 2010, to a police helicopter.
[02:18:31.063 --> 02:18:38.965]  And very untypically of this area, they were on the loudspeaker, giving the description of an armed robbery suspect.
[02:18:38.965 --> 02:18:47.587]  But what it did is it made me, it finally dawned on me how badly the police state needs us.
[02:18:47.587 --> 02:18:52.008]  And let me just preface that by saying back when the legal immigration
[02:18:53.109 --> 02:18:56.551]  Movement first started and there was those big demonstrations in L.A.
[02:18:56.551 --> 02:18:57.671]  Do you remember those?
[02:18:57.671 --> 02:19:01.093]  I don't remember the year of that.
[02:19:01.093 --> 02:19:03.775]  But you remember when there was like 500,000 marching through L.A.
[02:19:03.775 --> 02:19:10.478]  and then we had the May 1st demonstration shortly after that.
[02:19:10.478 --> 02:19:11.919]  That's when I got involved.
[02:19:11.919 --> 02:19:20.924]  Well, in my town, my town was one of few that got reported of any incidences of violence from the illegal immigrant population.
[02:19:21.690 --> 02:19:49.571]  and uh... in my town what they had to do is they had to pull from all different counties they had to gather up about four hundred uh... goons enforcers to uh... to quell the riot I'll come back and uh... finish up Yeah finish up your point and then we'll continue but I'm going to try to finish up this caller quickly and then a few others because I really we're two and a half hours in here ladies and gentlemen and I need to I've covered quite a bit of news but not as much as I want to I want to get into
[02:19:52.165 --> 02:19:57.694]  The fact that the media is now admitting we're in a depression, and that our country's gonna collapse.
[02:20:00.984 --> 02:20:05.527]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.527 --> 02:20:06.448]  Number 1.
[02:20:06.448 --> 02:20:09.871]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:09.871 --> 02:20:10.731]  Number 2.
[02:20:10.731 --> 02:20:15.615]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.615 --> 02:20:16.375]  It's true.
[02:20:16.375 --> 02:20:21.239]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.239 --> 02:20:22.060]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:25.662]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.662 --> 02:20:29.365]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.545 --> 02:20:30.346]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.346 --> 02:20:33.108]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.108 --> 02:20:36.791]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.791 --> 02:20:37.591]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.591 --> 02:20:41.734]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.734 --> 02:20:46.498]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:21:00.936 --> 02:21:03.598]  Hi, this is Peter Karanchnoble from Midas Resources.
[02:21:03.598 --> 02:21:10.024]  It is becoming painfully obvious the Washington bailout is running out of steam and the economy is showing signs of a double-dip recession.
[02:21:10.024 --> 02:21:15.108]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[02:21:15.108 --> 02:21:17.850]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:21:17.850 --> 02:21:20.572]  Are a majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[02:21:20.572 --> 02:21:23.395]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[02:21:23.715 --> 02:21:31.498]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy, or the dollar, your investment will never be worthless.
[02:21:31.498 --> 02:21:34.299]  And it will protect you from that hidden tax, inflation.
[02:21:34.299 --> 02:21:38.440]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:40.321]  Call me today, Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:21:44.082 --> 02:21:48.904]  And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.

[02:23:04.214 --> 02:23:06.275]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:23:06.275 --> 02:23:09.017]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:23:09.017 --> 02:23:11.238]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:23:11.238 --> 02:23:12.659]  Okay, here it comes.

[02:23:14.561 --> 02:23:16.502]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:23:16.502 --> 02:23:18.483]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:23:18.483 --> 02:23:22.166]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:23:22.166 --> 02:23:29.910]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[02:23:52.105 --> 02:23:52.505]  It works!
[02:24:05.723 --> 02:24:10.425]  Okay, Eric in California, finish up your point.
[02:24:10.425 --> 02:24:24.189]  Yeah, well, like I was saying, there was a small riot as soon as it got dark down here in my town, and they had to pull in resources from all the different cities throughout my particular county.
[02:24:24.189 --> 02:24:29.651]  My point being is, the police state needs us.
[02:24:29.651 --> 02:24:32.212]  They need us to participate.
[02:24:34.597 --> 02:24:36.679]  I'll tie this in with this.
[02:24:36.679 --> 02:24:43.023]  What's the big argument for cracking down on illegal aliens, you know, like what they're proposing to do in Arizona?
[02:24:43.023 --> 02:24:49.688]  Their big argument is, well, the Hispanic community won't trust the police, and therefore they won't help us fight crime.
[02:24:49.688 --> 02:24:52.611]  This is another example of what I'm saying.
[02:24:52.611 --> 02:24:57.374]  They need us for this police state.
[02:24:57.374 --> 02:24:59.376]  Hi, Harry, and I appreciate your call.
[02:24:59.376 --> 02:25:00.937]  Those are really good points that you've made.
[02:25:03.854 --> 02:25:07.678]  The problem is people need to have their own judgment.
[02:25:07.678 --> 02:25:13.044]  If the police are asking for your help to find a missing child, that's a good thing.
[02:25:13.044 --> 02:25:16.808]  Or if they're asking for your help to go fight a forest fire, you should saddle up and do it.
[02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:30.399]  But through an emergency alert system that is to find missing children, now it's got anti-gun messages and just random messages about spying on your neighbor.
[02:25:30.399 --> 02:25:37.304]  So they always use something that sounds reasonable to then push a complete takeover of society.
[02:25:37.304 --> 02:25:44.129]  You'll also notice that the IRS will visit a Sacramento car cleaner
[02:25:46.072 --> 02:25:58.938]  Car Wash for a four cent unpaid ticket, or four cent unpaid bill, and send armed officers, not once but twice, threatening to arrest them if they didn't pay the four cents.
[02:25:58.938 --> 02:26:00.738]  They hadn't even sent them a letter.
[02:26:00.738 --> 02:26:02.859]  But see, that's how they waste resources.
[02:26:02.859 --> 02:26:08.842]  Those on top know how to deploy them where they never actually stop any real crime.
[02:26:08.842 --> 02:26:09.922]  I mean, here's an article.
[02:26:09.922 --> 02:26:13.224]  Interpol asks web surfers to catch fugitives.
[02:26:14.918 --> 02:26:26.881]  Interpol has been caught in Europe with DynCorp, with Halliburton, with the UN, all over Eastern Europe, running the child kidnapping and the international prostitution.
[02:26:26.881 --> 02:26:29.542]  I mean, that's come out in government document after government document.
[02:26:29.542 --> 02:26:33.223]  Just Google, UN caught kidnapping women and children in Europe.
[02:26:33.223 --> 02:26:35.224]  You'll get BBC, you name it.
[02:26:35.224 --> 02:26:39.125]  And then read, Interpol comes up time and time again in there.
[02:26:40.985 --> 02:26:51.733]  It says, International Police Agency Interpol on Monday urged internet users to help track down hundreds of fugitives wanted for murder, rape, and sexual child abuse and other serious crimes.
[02:26:51.733 --> 02:26:56.757]  Well, why don't they go arrest some of the people in their own department?
[02:26:56.757 --> 02:27:01.461]  Again, Interpol is the federal police of every nation in Europe.
[02:27:01.461 --> 02:27:08.867]  And when you go to a hotel, this has been going on for 30 years or more, in Europe, you are registered into the Interpol system.
[02:27:08.867 --> 02:27:10.448]  Everywhere you go is being watched.
[02:27:11.513 --> 02:27:17.681]  But this is done so the criminals that run the society can be protected.
[02:27:17.681 --> 02:27:26.752]  Let's say one of these criminals ripped you off or killed your wife and you're gonna go to that European country next door to you, say you're in Spain, you're gonna go to Portugal.
[02:27:27.685 --> 02:27:38.168]  And this happens all the time, and they have a computer system that statistically will know, okay, this guy from Spain is coming to Portugal.
[02:27:38.168 --> 02:27:46.491]  Our actuaries, our analysis shows there's a 79% chance he's planning to do harm to this fellow that lives in Portugal.
[02:27:46.491 --> 02:27:56.494]  And they see you going from your city 500 miles away to a particular city in Portugal, and then when you get off the airplane, or when you pull into your hotel, an hour later,
[02:27:57.725 --> 02:27:58.986]  There's a knock on your door.
[02:27:58.986 --> 02:28:00.247]  Why are you here?
[02:28:00.247 --> 02:28:02.109]  Why are you in Portugal?
[02:28:02.109 --> 02:28:07.595]  And so, Interpol is mainly to make sure these globalists can commit their crimes and get away with it.
[02:28:07.595 --> 02:28:09.436]  I mean, large portions.
[02:28:09.436 --> 02:28:11.458]  This has come out in news report after news report.
[02:28:12.831 --> 02:28:18.114]  And some of them have been caught, of the European elite, are openly satanists and are openly pedophiles.
[02:28:18.114 --> 02:28:23.176]  It's you don't get in the club, like a lot of Republican congressmen, you've got to be gay.
[02:28:23.176 --> 02:28:25.558]  That's kind of the club here.
[02:28:25.558 --> 02:28:29.400]  Or with Democrats, it's always been in, for some reason, to rape women.
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:32.161]  I don't know why, but it just keeps coming up.
[02:28:32.161 --> 02:28:33.182]  That's kind of the club.
[02:28:33.182 --> 02:28:35.163]  They like to slap women around.
[02:28:35.163 --> 02:28:37.584]  Bill Clinton likes to bite them while he rapes them, to hold them down.
[02:28:37.584 --> 02:28:41.146]  He bites them on the lips, like a bulldog bites a bull.
[02:28:42.566 --> 02:28:43.747]  But that's what they do.
[02:28:43.747 --> 02:28:47.169]  And in Europe, it's pedophile run.
[02:28:47.169 --> 02:28:51.371]  And so anybody trying to get justice, Interpol is there to protect the pedophiles, period.
[02:28:51.371 --> 02:28:56.513]  And see, if you really want freedom, folks, you're gonna have to actually go research what I said and find out.
[02:28:56.513 --> 02:28:58.775]  I didn't just say that to be shocking, okay?
[02:28:58.775 --> 02:29:00.696]  That's actually true.
[02:29:00.696 --> 02:29:01.316]  Okay?
[02:29:01.316 --> 02:29:04.698]  And 15 years of deep research, it's just everywhere.
[02:29:04.698 --> 02:29:08.580]  You could find that out in five minutes just doing a search about it.
[02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:08.760]  But...
[02:29:12.298 --> 02:29:17.702]  Here's what I'm going to do, okay, because I keep saying I'm going to get to the news and then I don't.
[02:29:17.702 --> 02:29:30.310]  We're going to come back from break and I'm going to give each caller about a minute and a half, plus they've been holding, clear out this phone board and then I'm going to get to all this news instead of just eating around the edges.
[02:29:30.310 --> 02:29:33.912]  Those are so much.
[02:29:33.912 --> 02:29:34.693]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:34.693 --> 02:29:37.054]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:29:39.147 --> 02:29:40.468]  Study history.
[02:29:40.468 --> 02:29:45.029]  When good people lay around and become decadent, the worst elements take over.
[02:29:45.029 --> 02:29:45.809]  Okay?
[02:29:45.809 --> 02:29:51.151]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.151 --> 02:29:52.552]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.552 --> 02:29:55.073]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.073 --> 02:29:57.774]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:57.543 --> 02:30:59.284]  This information is too important to wait.
[02:31:00.128 --> 02:31:04.691]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.691 --> 02:31:05.592]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.592 --> 02:31:09.015]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.015 --> 02:31:09.875]  Number 2.
[02:31:09.875 --> 02:31:14.779]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.779 --> 02:31:15.519]  It's true.
[02:31:15.519 --> 02:31:20.403]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.403 --> 02:31:21.224]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.224 --> 02:31:24.806]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.806 --> 02:31:28.509]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.709 --> 02:31:29.489]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.489 --> 02:31:32.250]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.250 --> 02:31:35.951]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.951 --> 02:31:36.731]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.731 --> 02:31:40.872]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.872 --> 02:31:45.934]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:45.934 --> 02:31:50.095]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.095 --> 02:31:51.896]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:57.757 --> 02:32:04.219]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:04.219 --> 02:32:10.621]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:10.621 --> 02:32:18.003]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:18.003 --> 02:32:22.544]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:32:22.884 --> 02:32:31.552]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:32:31.552 --> 02:32:35.275]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:35.802 --> 02:32:42.589]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:42.589 --> 02:32:46.472]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:46.472 --> 02:32:54.540]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:32:54.540 --> 02:32:55.001]  Thank you.
[02:33:04.677 --> 02:33:05.538]  Ha!
[02:33:05.538 --> 02:33:07.199]  We are back live!
[02:33:07.199 --> 02:33:09.380]  We need to get fired up for freedom!
[02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:13.322]  We need to defend the republic.
[02:33:13.322 --> 02:33:19.786]  We need to stay focused every day and realize this is a life and death situation.
[02:33:19.786 --> 02:33:23.988]  Not just for our own individual lives, but for the life of free humanity.
[02:33:23.988 --> 02:33:26.230]  Laura in Iowa, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:33:27.375 --> 02:33:31.377]  Hi Alex, I've been listening to you for 15 years, no kidding.
[02:33:31.377 --> 02:33:32.797]  Wow.
[02:33:32.797 --> 02:33:44.002]  Yeah, I've been listening to you since you first came out and what I want to say is that why don't we separate, form our own colonies, join together, take America back.
[02:33:44.002 --> 02:33:45.223]  Take what's ours back.
[02:33:45.823 --> 02:33:50.346]  Why are we going to just sit here and wait until the UN kicks in our door and hauls us off to a VMA?
[02:34:06.275 --> 02:34:16.639]  They have secret police now grabbing US, Canadian and British citizens and putting bags over their heads on TV to send the message of, we will snatch you, we will grab you.
[02:34:16.639 --> 02:34:24.542]  Those cops are being trained to snatch and grab and then now openly take someone to a dungeon to be tortured and never seen again.
[02:34:24.542 --> 02:34:29.204]  They're actually promoting that on the news and they've started the snatching and grabbing part.
[02:34:30.184 --> 02:34:32.124]  And they're telling us torture's good.
[02:34:32.124 --> 02:34:50.788]  So, I mean, I'm not trying to poo-poo your idea, and it's kind of like the Free State Project, people moving to New Hampshire, and I'm all for people forming little communities, but now they're harassing the Amish, using environmental rules to try to take their kids and take their land.
[02:34:50.788 --> 02:34:55.289]  I mean, I agree with you that's a logical thing to do.
[02:34:55.289 --> 02:34:58.110]  The problem is there's nowhere to go.
[02:35:01.072 --> 02:35:02.315]  Wow.
[02:35:02.315 --> 02:35:03.318]  It just sickens me.
[02:35:03.318 --> 02:35:04.039]  I'm like you.
[02:35:04.039 --> 02:35:05.743]  I'm up at night.
[02:35:05.743 --> 02:35:06.826]  I'm pacing around.
[02:35:06.826 --> 02:35:07.167]  I just...
[02:35:07.853 --> 02:35:08.834]  I'm just sick of it.
[02:35:08.834 --> 02:35:12.836]  I'm sick of them stripping away our freedoms.
[02:35:12.836 --> 02:35:13.437]  I'm just tired of it.
[02:35:38.974 --> 02:35:41.997]  I just want to say that I highly respect you.
[02:35:41.997 --> 02:35:50.805]  I've been on your side for many years and I've been on America's side even longer and I just know that we will win in the end and hang in there.
[02:35:50.805 --> 02:35:51.485]  Don't give up.
[02:35:51.485 --> 02:35:54.368]  I know you're discouraged because I can hear it sometimes in your voice.
[02:35:54.368 --> 02:35:57.030]  I get that way too, but God bless America.
[02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:58.471]  Let's get her back.
[02:35:58.471 --> 02:35:59.773]  Laura, thank you.
[02:35:59.773 --> 02:36:02.155]  You know, it's not that I'm discouraged.
[02:36:06.201 --> 02:36:25.490]  I'm intellectually pleased that we're gaining so much headway, but now I realize that the battle is joined, and that the system is now taking our resistance serious, and I'm just every day more and more dumbfounded by how real this is.
[02:36:25.490 --> 02:36:35.374]  You want to think more of your fellow man, and to just have everything we ever covered confirmed in triplicate,
[02:36:36.576 --> 02:36:39.198]  It's not a good feeling.
[02:36:39.198 --> 02:36:41.801]  I'm not happy I'm right.
[02:36:41.801 --> 02:36:42.982]  I wish I was a kook.
[02:36:42.982 --> 02:36:45.544]  I wish I was a conspiracy theorist.
[02:36:45.544 --> 02:36:50.988]  And I see people on the YouTube comment boards and I see them on the InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:36:50.988 --> 02:37:01.998]  You know, I made a video Friday about the economic implosion that's happening and how it's by design and
[02:37:03.223 --> 02:37:08.484]  It was emergency SOS, America being taken over by offshore banks.
[02:37:08.484 --> 02:37:14.225]  And I saw about half the people commenting going, oh, shut up conspiracy theorists, none of this is happening.
[02:37:14.225 --> 02:37:16.086]  There's no problem.
[02:37:16.086 --> 02:37:19.086]  You're trash, you're scum.
[02:37:19.086 --> 02:37:21.787]  They don't even have self-preservation instincts.
[02:37:21.787 --> 02:37:26.568]  I mean, everything I said in that 15-minute video that's had over 100,000 views,
[02:37:29.292 --> 02:37:38.077]  Is on the record now, world government, the UN wanting to scrap the dollar for a global SDR, private banks ruling us.
[02:37:38.077 --> 02:37:39.658]  I mean, I live in a republic.
[02:37:39.658 --> 02:37:41.259]  I rule myself.
[02:37:41.259 --> 02:37:43.641]  I am the sovereign.
[02:37:43.641 --> 02:37:47.603]  My ancestors, like your ancestors, created this country.
[02:37:47.603 --> 02:37:56.709]  And it's not perfect, but it's a lot better than some offshore swindlers who call themselves banks, this criminal ruling class dominating me.
[02:37:56.709 --> 02:37:58.050]  I mean, I don't like being conquered.
[02:37:59.656 --> 02:38:06.628]  I mean, these people really openly are on the news saying, we'll arrest any citizens we want and we'll torture them.
[02:38:06.628 --> 02:38:11.977]  And they're paying private contractors to throw bags over people's heads and throw them in vans all over the world.
[02:38:13.524 --> 02:38:23.889]  On the news, and the news reports it like it's, well, the police are letting private contractors arrest people, and it shows someone with a bag being thrown over their head and being drug into a car.
[02:38:23.889 --> 02:38:29.691]  That's being done to acclimate everyone where cops and others just think it's normal.
[02:38:29.691 --> 02:38:37.635]  We're being lowered down into the acid right now.
[02:38:37.635 --> 02:38:41.597]  And it's gonna make people wake up, but I'm sitting here watching this
[02:38:44.158 --> 02:38:56.602]  This war, this battle being joined, and I'm in the fight, but I'm also in like a general's perspective, looking at it, and I'm just like, why did this have to happen?
[02:38:56.602 --> 02:39:08.206]  And I see these masses of people who aren't awake, and I care about them, I love them, I want them to have freedom, I want them to control their own destiny, I want them to not be slaves, and they're laughing at me.
[02:39:08.206 --> 02:39:10.067]  And I don't even get angry at them.
[02:39:10.067 --> 02:39:11.747]  They're pathetic.
[02:39:11.747 --> 02:39:12.928]  It makes me feel sick.
[02:39:14.770 --> 02:39:20.138]  You ever seen somebody do something bad that you're friends with or somebody you know and it's like an embarrassed feeling?
[02:39:20.138 --> 02:39:21.320]  You feel embarrassed?
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:24.705]  I feel embarrassed.
[02:39:24.705 --> 02:39:28.070]  I guess overall that's, I just feel embarrassed how pathetic we are.
[02:39:29.158 --> 02:39:34.985]  But then I also know how great humans are and the art, the literature, the bravery, the ingenuity.
[02:39:34.985 --> 02:39:48.821]  I just love humanity so much and I know my children are part of humanity and I want them to grow up and to have a good future and I want my daughters to find good, loving, strong men who care about them and want to build them up.
[02:39:50.783 --> 02:39:53.605]  And I want my son to find a good woman to be his wife.
[02:39:53.605 --> 02:39:58.509]  And I do think about, my God, I brought children into this world.
[02:39:58.509 --> 02:40:02.232]  But if I had to do it over again, I would, because I can't give up.
[02:40:02.232 --> 02:40:04.033]  But still, it freaks me out.
[02:40:04.033 --> 02:40:07.556]  I'm like, what in the world?
[02:40:07.556 --> 02:40:10.838]  Truth is so much stranger than fiction, as they say, and it's true.
[02:40:10.838 --> 02:40:16.483]  This is so bizarre.
[02:40:16.483 --> 02:40:18.024]  And it's all admitted.
[02:40:18.024 --> 02:40:18.965]  I mean, I knew
[02:40:20.894 --> 02:40:28.439]  In 1999, that they were putting microphones up everywhere with the NSA listening for keywords and recording it.
[02:40:28.439 --> 02:40:32.881]  I found the documents, found the reports, but it's in the news today.
[02:40:32.881 --> 02:40:36.023]  It's all over the news that, hey, guess what?
[02:40:36.023 --> 02:40:40.086]  Microphones have been put up to record you in malls and on the street.
[02:40:41.311 --> 02:40:41.871]  I mean, this is bad!
[02:40:41.871 --> 02:40:42.751]  This is real bad!
[02:41:06.124 --> 02:41:08.144]  In the past, I thought, well, they haven't killed me.
[02:41:08.144 --> 02:41:14.866]  They have threatened me and other things, but because they don't want to underline and highlight everything I've said.
[02:41:14.866 --> 02:41:20.007]  But more than that, they just think so little of you that they think there's nothing you're going to do about it.
[02:41:20.007 --> 02:41:22.067]  Because you don't see yourselves as leaders.
[02:41:22.067 --> 02:41:24.248]  You don't see yourself in a role of standing up.
[02:41:24.248 --> 02:41:28.249]  You wouldn't know how to stand up, they think.
[02:41:28.249 --> 02:41:31.229]  Because you expect everything instantly, they think.
[02:41:31.229 --> 02:41:34.410]  They think that you're weak-minded and shallow and that they can do these things.
[02:41:35.563 --> 02:41:43.026]  Now they're starting to shift, they're starting to see that we've got a good chance of defeating them if people get a winning spirit.
[02:41:43.026 --> 02:41:48.528]  If people get a winning attitude and have the facts.
[02:41:48.528 --> 02:42:03.653]  If we're determined and they understand that I've got a lot of problems but I am determined and I've had a lot of success against the enemy and they know that people see that as a model of future success and so they are scared of us.
[02:42:05.472 --> 02:42:07.792]  Yeah, there's our story from what, four years ago?
[02:42:07.792 --> 02:42:12.453]  Government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[02:42:12.453 --> 02:42:15.994]  That's from PrisonPlanet.com, September 6, 2006.
[02:42:15.994 --> 02:42:18.095]  By the way, where did that come from?
[02:42:18.095 --> 02:42:28.837]  Google put out a stinking press release, and I got called a kook by several newspapers for having Paul Watson write an article about it.
[02:42:28.837 --> 02:42:30.397]  And then now today, they come out and admit
[02:42:36.291 --> 02:42:45.276]  I mean, do I have to explain to people that the government listening to you inside your house without a warrant is tyranny?
[02:42:45.276 --> 02:42:57.163]  I mean, just four years ago, Bush was strutting around on television at press conferences saying, I am not spying on the American people.
[02:42:57.163 --> 02:42:59.424]  These warrantless wiretaps are only for Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:00.503 --> 02:43:11.507]  And then of course it came out that there were hundreds of thousands of them, literally different mass wiretaps listening to tens of millions of Americans randomly, and that they had premeditatedly lied.
[02:43:11.507 --> 02:43:13.027]  Of course they did.
[02:43:13.027 --> 02:43:15.408]  Bush had that big, you know what, eatin' grin on his face.
[02:43:15.408 --> 02:43:16.528]  He enjoys it.
[02:43:16.528 --> 02:43:17.809]  It's funny to him.
[02:43:17.809 --> 02:43:19.590]  Bush sees you as an animal.
[02:43:19.590 --> 02:43:20.730]  He's a psychopath.
[02:43:20.730 --> 02:43:22.551]  He sees you as a piece of meat.
[02:43:22.551 --> 02:43:29.293]  That's why he'll even wipe his glasses on Clinton's coat, or he'll be on Jay Leno, or on other shows.
[02:43:30.998 --> 02:43:42.103]  You know, before the show, a woman walks by to adjust somebody else's makeup, and he'll grab their dress and clean his glasses, because you're seen as a piece of tissue paper.
[02:43:42.103 --> 02:43:46.305]  He blows his snot into it and throws it in the trash.
[02:43:46.305 --> 02:43:55.130]  In fact, they found it so quickly.
[02:43:55.130 --> 02:43:57.831]  There he is, cleaning his glasses on her.
[02:43:59.738 --> 02:44:03.363]  And as soon as you get that, you know, people say, that's not happening in America.
[02:44:03.363 --> 02:44:04.904]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[02:44:04.904 --> 02:44:13.254]  That is you literally in a trance under mind control, rationalizing whenever your face was something that threatens you and that scares you.
[02:44:13.254 --> 02:44:14.476]  You just say, that's not true.
[02:44:14.476 --> 02:44:15.717]  That's not true.
[02:44:15.717 --> 02:44:16.799]  That's not real.
[02:44:19.209 --> 02:44:20.550]  Look, it's real, okay?
[02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:23.931]  It's so much more real, I can't even describe it to you.
[02:44:23.931 --> 02:44:27.673]  And for all of you out there, and a lot of it's a snowball effect.
[02:44:27.673 --> 02:44:37.897]  They admittedly have government psychological warfare databases of certain phrases and terms that they have discovered are effective with weak-minded people.
[02:44:37.897 --> 02:44:38.017]  And
[02:44:38.919 --> 02:44:52.831]  The Easily Influenced, and you'll see these comments on YouTube and everywhere else, and you can even click on their handles and go to their websites, and a lot of times, they admit they're an army psyops, or they work for a big corporation in public relations.
[02:44:52.831 --> 02:45:00.658]  And they'll just come out and say, you know, none of this is true, you're a tinfoil hat wearer.
[02:45:00.658 --> 02:45:05.422]  And the simpler, the more mindless it is, the more effective it is.
[02:45:07.122 --> 02:45:09.745]  Until they're psychologically ready to roll out with it.
[02:45:09.745 --> 02:45:13.909]  They think you're acclimated and conditioned enough to go from, Alex is a crazy kook.
[02:45:13.909 --> 02:45:16.532]  There's no microphones put up in your town to listen to you.
[02:45:16.532 --> 02:45:23.859]  You know, this guy's a nut to, yeah, we've put them out for over a decade and we're also listening to you in your house.
[02:45:23.859 --> 02:45:24.640]  It's for your safety.
[02:45:25.751 --> 02:45:32.774]  And then those people that were saying I was a kook, they just go, well of course we need microphones listening to us.
[02:45:32.774 --> 02:45:36.095]  Or they still keep lying and saying there is no article.
[02:45:36.095 --> 02:45:40.356]  I could sit here on TV with all the articles where they're admittedly listening to you, worse than 1984.
[02:45:42.097 --> 02:45:47.782]  And it's done to target you the good people that know what you're up to and to know how to manipulate you.
[02:45:47.782 --> 02:45:57.851]  And it's known to see what economic decisions you're going to be making because they put it into these big aggregators to then make decisions on how to better rape you, how to better manipulate you financially.
[02:45:57.851 --> 02:46:00.954]  And they admit that.
[02:46:00.954 --> 02:46:04.978]  The biggest way the NSA operates is they'll see a trend for
[02:46:08.109 --> 02:46:19.181]  Say French Bulldogs five years ago, and they'll just give that information to a select board of corporations, and then those corporations can use that data however they want.
[02:46:19.181 --> 02:46:26.349]  If they want to put a French Bulldog on a lunchbox, knowing it'll sell easier, which gives them an unfair trade advantage.
[02:46:27.563 --> 02:46:36.329]  Or, the way one NSA guy described it to me, the NSA doesn't know why, but strawberries start getting real popular, and everything's strawberries, strawberries, strawberries.
[02:46:36.329 --> 02:46:38.611]  Then they know how to pre-position from that.
[02:46:38.611 --> 02:46:54.382]  They kind of boil it down in a simple way in V for Vendetta, where it shows these trucks driving around with dishes on the roofs, listening to what's happening in people's houses, which they actually really do have, with these acoustic microphones, and
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:47:08.865]  They go into the board meeting with the police, the FBI, and others, with the Big Brother fellow, and they say the positive mention is down to a record level, down to below 40%.
[02:47:10.868 --> 02:47:13.729]  And they say, that's it, we've got to move now, we're in deep trouble.
[02:47:13.729 --> 02:47:15.769]  Once it drops between 40, it's all over.
[02:47:15.769 --> 02:47:19.170]  They are actually listening to you in your house!
[02:47:19.170 --> 02:47:21.110]  They know what you really think of the government.
[02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:25.291]  They know the majority of you know 9-11's an inside job.
[02:47:25.291 --> 02:47:28.552]  They know many of you are waking up about the poison in the water.
[02:47:28.552 --> 02:47:31.453]  They know you're waking up about the bankers being criminals.
[02:47:31.453 --> 02:47:35.374]  They know the majority of you know that the oil leak's a staged event.
[02:47:36.388 --> 02:47:42.410]  Okay, they know, they know, they know that we really do have 4 million web visitors a week.
[02:47:42.410 --> 02:47:47.792]  They know we really do have between 2 to 5 million radio listeners a week, depending on which week.
[02:47:47.792 --> 02:47:50.153]  They know it's exponentially growing.
[02:47:50.153 --> 02:47:51.713]  They're going to start a war, folks.
[02:47:51.713 --> 02:47:53.294]  They're going to blow oil wells.
[02:47:53.294 --> 02:47:54.854]  They're going to stage crises.
[02:47:54.854 --> 02:48:00.576]  They're going to stage mass shootings and blame it on patriots, all in an attempt to shut you up to go along with this.
[02:48:07.918 --> 02:48:11.999]  See, there's no more denial for those of you out there that are childlike.
[02:48:11.999 --> 02:48:13.679]  The government is listening to you.
[02:48:13.679 --> 02:48:15.399]  Google is the NSA.
[02:48:15.399 --> 02:48:19.460]  They are listening to you in your house and watching you with the camera built in.
[02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:21.761]  They are using your iPads, your iPhones.
[02:48:21.761 --> 02:48:25.281]  They are using all of the systems that are cell phone enabled.
[02:48:25.281 --> 02:48:27.242]  They are using everything to track you.
[02:48:27.242 --> 02:48:29.742]  It was designed to track you.
[02:48:29.742 --> 02:48:31.422]  They are completely criminal.
[02:48:31.422 --> 02:48:35.263]  If you're 38 years old or younger, they took your blood at birth.
[02:48:37.236 --> 02:48:39.678]  And put it in a bioweapons database.
[02:48:39.678 --> 02:48:42.040]  I told you this 15 years ago.
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:43.061]  It's now admitted.
[02:48:43.061 --> 02:48:44.682]  This isn't a joke.
[02:48:44.682 --> 02:48:47.144]  There isn't time to screw around.
[02:48:47.144 --> 02:48:48.465]  Listen, cops.
[02:48:48.465 --> 02:48:49.886]  Listen, military.
[02:48:49.886 --> 02:48:52.528]  You are being poisoned.
[02:48:52.528 --> 02:48:55.070]  You have got to choose sides.
[02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:56.151]  And there's no decision.
[02:48:56.151 --> 02:48:57.412]  You're already on our side.
[02:48:57.412 --> 02:48:59.753]  You're already slated for extermination.
[02:48:59.753 --> 02:49:04.057]  Slow, soft-kill extermination getting more and more intense.
[02:49:04.057 --> 02:49:06.418]  The system's already tested how to roll out a new plague.
[02:49:07.479 --> 02:49:15.787]  Have a celebrity lead the plague and to make sure they manage the plague so that real cures and the real cause is never found.
[02:49:15.787 --> 02:49:18.409]  They already know how to make money out of killing you.
[02:49:18.409 --> 02:49:20.191]  This isn't a joke.
[02:49:20.191 --> 02:49:22.093]  This isn't a conspiracy theory.
[02:49:22.093 --> 02:49:23.514]  It's a fact.
[02:49:23.514 --> 02:49:26.437]  You've got to join us bureaucrats.
[02:49:26.437 --> 02:49:31.702]  All of you people that go to these Ivy League universities that are taught you're the elite and the public's a bunch of scum.
[02:49:32.930 --> 02:49:34.811]  You're seen as scum as well.
[02:49:34.811 --> 02:49:37.533]  You're creating a hell planet.
[02:49:37.533 --> 02:49:45.937]  All of you that work as bureaucrats or media people, all of you that hold this system up, the system is a meat grinder.
[02:49:45.937 --> 02:49:48.199]  The system is a wood chipper.
[02:49:48.199 --> 02:49:52.701]  And sure, they were putting the blacks in 50 years ago and you laughed at them, hearing them squeal.
[02:49:52.701 --> 02:49:54.963]  Now they've gotten up to you in the wood chipper.
[02:49:55.842 --> 02:49:57.984]  Are you going to continue to laugh about it?
[02:49:57.984 --> 02:49:59.986]  Are you going to continue to think you're a winner?
[02:49:59.986 --> 02:50:02.909]  Are you going to continue to think you're part of the winning team?
[02:50:02.909 --> 02:50:07.854]  You're not on the winning team in this predatory system.
[02:50:07.854 --> 02:50:12.378]  Killing millions of innocent Arabs isn't funny.
[02:50:12.378 --> 02:50:15.081]  The troops growing opium in Afghanistan isn't funny.
[02:50:16.514 --> 02:50:20.657]  All of this will come back on us and is coming back on us.
[02:50:20.657 --> 02:50:25.079]  The globalists hate you, the American people, much more than they hate the Arabs.
[02:50:25.079 --> 02:50:26.660]  Why are they killing the Arabs?
[02:50:26.660 --> 02:50:30.823]  Because they have courage and they're independent and they have big families.
[02:50:30.823 --> 02:50:34.385]  And they're certainly not perfect and have a lot of cultural problems as well.
[02:50:34.385 --> 02:50:34.906]  Everybody does.
[02:50:35.916 --> 02:50:39.318]  But they are killing them because they're red-blooded, folks.
[02:50:39.318 --> 02:50:43.980]  They're taking them over so they can be exterminated through the soft kill weapons.
[02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:46.521]  They don't have fluoridated water, folks.
[02:50:46.521 --> 02:50:49.202]  Okay, they still are red-blooded.
[02:50:49.202 --> 02:50:52.484]  They are domesticating you to kill you.
[02:50:52.484 --> 02:50:56.565]  They are domesticating you ahead of your orderly extermination.
[02:50:56.565 --> 02:50:58.146]  This is not a drill.
[02:50:58.146 --> 02:51:01.228]  Four calls and the whole last hour will be news.
[02:51:01.228 --> 02:51:04.109]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've got to try my pillow.

[02:54:14.747 --> 02:54:16.208]  Gil in Texas.
[02:54:16.208 --> 02:54:17.469]  Thank you for holding her on the air.
[02:54:17.469 --> 02:54:18.149]  Good to talk to you.
[02:54:18.149 --> 02:54:21.811]  It's been a long time since I've spoken to you, Alex.
[02:54:21.811 --> 02:54:23.773]  My God, what can you say?
[02:54:23.773 --> 02:54:31.417]  I mean, our father said, where they actually have the troops protecting the poppy fields.
[02:54:31.417 --> 02:54:34.239]  Effectively, that's going to bring poison right here to this country.
[02:54:34.239 --> 02:54:37.061]  We have our troops protecting the poison that's going to poison our own people.
[02:54:38.223 --> 02:54:39.364]  Isn't that crazy?
[02:54:39.364 --> 02:54:41.265]  And they put it in our face.
[02:54:41.265 --> 02:54:42.426]  This is the PSYOP.
[02:54:42.426 --> 02:54:44.068]  They admit everything now.
[02:54:44.068 --> 02:54:45.749]  They're now all over the news today.
[02:54:45.749 --> 02:54:53.675]  I saw no fewer than five mainstream reports saying yes, microphones have been put up to listen to you.
[02:54:53.675 --> 02:54:57.058]  We called them gunshot detectors, but we're really recording you.
[02:54:57.058 --> 02:55:01.282]  And NSA software is tracking everything you do.
[02:55:01.282 --> 02:55:02.803]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:55:03.404 --> 02:55:10.566]  I had no security out here where I live, but now we have nighttime security in a vehicle with a pretty yellow flashing light.
[02:55:10.566 --> 02:55:15.387]  I imagine they have the ability to listen in on the conversations in and around our apartment.
[02:55:15.387 --> 02:55:20.669]  They found tar balls on Crystal Beach now, here in Texas.
[02:55:20.669 --> 02:55:27.191]  And they're not wanting to admit or confirm that it's possibly from the BP oil spill.
[02:55:27.191 --> 02:55:29.312]  There's just so much going on.
[02:55:29.312 --> 02:55:30.752]  I had a vision, I hope it's not true,
[02:55:31.619 --> 02:55:36.363]  Of blood in the skies here on the Gulf Coast.
[02:55:36.363 --> 02:55:40.926]  So you're down there by Galveston and you're saying you're seeing tarballs coming up?
[02:55:40.926 --> 02:55:41.827]  I'm near the boot.
[02:55:41.827 --> 02:55:47.031]  I'm actually in southeast Texas, Beaumont-Pedarpa-Orange area.
[02:55:47.031 --> 02:55:50.414]  Port Nature's where I picked Mars' hills from in that area.
[02:55:50.414 --> 02:55:54.397]  In fact, I can spit and hit Port Nature's from where I'm from.
[02:55:54.397 --> 02:55:57.880]  And yeah, they're saying they're having tarballs wash up on
[02:55:58.636 --> 02:56:02.417]  I'm hearing rumors also that this thing is far beyond what they're willing to admit.
[02:56:20.007 --> 02:56:30.012]  Yeah, well first they said it was 5,000 barrels a day, then it was 10, then 20, then 30, then 50,000 barrels a day.
[02:56:30.012 --> 02:56:38.116]  So they've lied so much, I don't think anyone even knows, but we do know from the satellite and aircraft photos that most of the oil
[02:56:39.070 --> 02:56:43.072]  Because it's coming up from 5,000 feet under the water, is in underwater plumes.
[02:56:43.072 --> 02:56:47.375]  And so, most of the oil hasn't even gotten to the surface.
[02:56:47.375 --> 02:57:07.728]  And as the Gulf heats up in late summer, to the temperature of a bathtub, as it does every year, as it takes, again, a whole summer for it to get hot, it's such a large body, but once it gets hot, it gets really hot, that all that oil's then gonna come up, because when it's cold, for some reason, it causes it to stay lower in the water, and it's gonna off-gas all those gases,
[02:57:08.368 --> 02:57:11.030]  And so this is just horrible.
[02:57:11.030 --> 02:57:20.657]  And yeah, the reports I've seen are that Hurricane Alex did blow in a lot of that oil and that some of it had drifted over towards Texas.
[02:57:20.657 --> 02:57:30.884]  And it's unconfirmed whether or not that's from that oil spill or some other spill because when everybody's busy watching this spill, other oil companies don't have to be as careful.
[02:57:30.884 --> 02:57:32.225]  Anything else?
[02:57:32.225 --> 02:57:33.306]  Oh, Project Wolfbox.
[02:57:34.639 --> 02:57:35.542]  What's the latest?
[02:57:35.542 --> 02:57:36.324]  You're hearing anything?
[02:57:36.324 --> 02:57:40.277]  There's some people on the internet saying that maybe at 48 hours after the 4th...
[02:57:41.263 --> 02:57:47.689]  He might, might slowly start implementing this mass evacuation of the Gulf Coast, probably including my area as well.
[02:57:47.689 --> 02:57:51.593]  I don't know, there's a lot of speculation and unfortunately no facts.
[02:57:51.593 --> 02:57:59.160]  I tried to open the phones up for whistleblowers and we got some interesting info but nothing specific.
[02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:05.406]  I would imagine they're going to start trying to evacuate people if they do, when that main oil comes ashore.
[02:58:06.397 --> 02:58:09.020]  Being pushed by hurricanes coming into the Gulf.
[02:58:09.020 --> 02:58:11.962]  We'll continue to track it, Gil.
[02:58:11.962 --> 02:58:13.864]  Alright, here's... Gil, thank you.
[02:58:13.864 --> 02:58:14.705]  We gotta go to break here.
[02:58:14.705 --> 02:58:15.325]  Good to hear from you.
[02:58:15.325 --> 02:58:15.746]  God bless.
[02:58:15.746 --> 02:58:23.053]  And we'll pray for you down there on the Texas coast, but especially those in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida being the heaviest hit.
[02:58:23.053 --> 02:58:26.976]  And of course, the Florida Keys, the main body of oil in those...
[02:58:29.571 --> 02:58:32.915]  Currents is being directed out towards the keys.
[02:58:32.915 --> 02:58:34.737]  We're going to come back with the fourth and final hour.
[02:58:34.737 --> 02:58:38.481]  I will cover news and then back to your calls.
[02:58:38.481 --> 02:58:42.906]  Stay with us.

[02:58:54.794 --> 02:58:56.056]  Tyranny is here.
[02:58:56.056 --> 02:58:59.700]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:02.223]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:59:02.223 --> 02:59:08.090]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:59:08.090 --> 02:59:14.337]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:59:14.757 --> 02:59:20.701]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:59:20.701 --> 02:59:24.904]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:59:24.904 --> 02:59:29.187]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:59:29.187 --> 02:59:35.152]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:59:35.152 --> 02:59:38.694]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:59:38.694 --> 02:59:40.675]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:59:40.675 --> 02:59:41.116]  It's here.

[02:59:55.983 --> 02:59:58.764]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:08.783 --> 03:00:11.525]  It is the fourth and final hour.
[03:00:11.525 --> 03:00:15.968]  I am going to cover news intensely for the next half hour.
[03:00:15.968 --> 03:00:20.671]  Then we will go to your phone calls, Tim, Ron, Michael, and others that are patiently holding.
[03:00:20.671 --> 03:00:23.173]  You'll want to get queued up for calls in 30 minutes.
[03:00:23.173 --> 03:00:24.033]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:00:24.033 --> 03:00:24.754]  It is July 5th, 2010.
[03:00:24.754 --> 03:00:25.955]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:00:25.955 --> 03:00:28.096]  Okay, let me go ahead and launch into this today.
[03:00:37.805 --> 03:00:38.185]  I don't know.
[03:00:57.935 --> 03:01:01.459]  Coming out with this in the open, and that's a question I would field to the listeners.
[03:01:01.459 --> 03:01:03.021]  Why do you think that's the case?
[03:01:03.021 --> 03:01:05.303]  I have my take on it, and I'll be going over that.
[03:01:05.303 --> 03:01:07.946]  Here is CNBC.
[03:01:07.946 --> 03:01:14.053]  Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[03:01:14.053 --> 03:01:18.378]  And this is what our guest, the economist we've had on, had been saying for two years.
[03:01:19.569 --> 03:01:28.576]  That we've really been in a recession for four, a depression for two, and that the charts mirror what happened in 29 through 33.
[03:01:28.576 --> 03:01:31.799]  They didn't announce that we were in a depression until the middle of 1933.
[03:01:31.799 --> 03:01:39.145]  And then, of course, the War Powers Act was declared, and the United States was put under a form of economic martial law.
[03:01:41.614 --> 03:01:57.164]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is repeating a pattern that appeared just before markets fell during the Great Depression, Daryl Guppy, CEO at Guppy Traders, told CNBC today.
[03:01:58.260 --> 03:02:01.242]  Those who don't remember history are doomed to repeat it.
[03:02:01.242 --> 03:02:07.447]  There was a head-and-shoulders pattern that developed before the Great Depression in 1929.
[03:02:07.447 --> 03:02:14.052]  Then with the recovery of 1930, we had another head-and-shoulders pattern that preceded a fall in the market.
[03:02:14.052 --> 03:02:18.936]  And in the current Dow situation, we see an exact repeat of that environment, Guppy said.
[03:02:18.936 --> 03:02:22.419]  The Dow retreated 457 points, or 4.5% last week to close.
[03:02:26.562 --> 03:02:27.703]  At 9,686.
[03:02:27.703 --> 03:02:30.406]  Now the Globalist may go prop that up.
[03:02:30.406 --> 03:02:31.167]  I haven't looked today.
[03:02:31.167 --> 03:02:32.408]  Will you guys pull up the Dow?
[03:02:32.408 --> 03:02:34.631]  It was at 9,686 Friday.
[03:02:34.631 --> 03:02:36.933]  Let's see what it is today.
[03:02:36.933 --> 03:02:41.958]  Guppy said a Dow fall below 9,800 confirmed the head and shoulders pattern.
[03:02:42.932 --> 03:02:49.815]  The Shanghai Composite is seeing a very rapid collapse, falling below 2,500, which suggests a major fall in the Dow.
[03:02:49.815 --> 03:02:57.418]  He added, in the European markets, Guppy says Frankfurt DAX is witnessing a different pattern to London's FTSE.
[03:02:57.418 --> 03:03:03.300]  And again, I put out an emergency alert Friday, SOS emergency alert.
[03:03:05.017 --> 03:03:07.759]  Emergency SOS is the name of the video.
[03:03:07.759 --> 03:03:08.920]  You can search that term.
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:13.824]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and it states the facts.
[03:03:13.824 --> 03:03:19.869]  The private central banks, they're not even banks, they're just fraudsters, have set this up in the last 15 years.
[03:03:19.869 --> 03:03:21.530]  They've admitted they've set it up.
[03:03:21.530 --> 03:03:29.857]  It's all pre-planned, and we've got to stop them.
[03:03:32.028 --> 03:03:38.610]  I guess the Dow's down again today, another 46 plus points, 46.05.
[03:03:38.610 --> 03:03:40.991]  It's closed today.
[03:03:40.991 --> 03:03:43.932]  Okay, I guess it's a holiday, so that's Friday.
[03:03:43.932 --> 03:03:49.514]  It goes on to say, Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[03:03:49.514 --> 03:03:50.714]  Here's another one.
[03:03:50.714 --> 03:03:51.694]  With the U.S.
[03:03:51.694 --> 03:03:55.355]  trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[03:03:55.355 --> 03:04:00.057]  And that's Ambrose Evans Pritchard, a very prestigious writer,
[03:04:01.857 --> 03:04:04.599]  With London Telegraph, the U.S.
[03:04:04.599 --> 03:04:11.364]  workforce shrank 652,000 jobs in June, one of the sharpest contractions ever.
[03:04:11.364 --> 03:04:14.486]  That rate of hourly earnings fell 0.1%.
[03:04:14.486 --> 03:04:17.989]  Wages are flirting with deflation.
[03:04:17.989 --> 03:04:25.334]  So they're devaluing the currency while you have depression in the real economy.
[03:04:25.334 --> 03:04:28.376]  Wall Street's making record profits.
[03:04:28.376 --> 03:04:30.118]  You've got deflation in wages.
[03:04:31.735 --> 03:04:36.404]  But inflation in currency value.
[03:04:36.404 --> 03:04:39.088]  Now, they didn't believe that could even exist until the late 70s.
[03:04:39.088 --> 03:04:41.232]  It's stag inflation.
[03:04:41.232 --> 03:04:43.557]  This is leaning towards hyper stag inflation.
[03:04:46.397 --> 03:04:48.718]  I mean, we live in a completely rigged economy.
[03:04:48.718 --> 03:04:53.180]  And even MSNBC had a headline, or CNBC admitting that last week.
[03:04:53.180 --> 03:04:56.081]  Dylan Radigan came out and said the entire stock market's rigged.
[03:04:56.081 --> 03:04:57.001]  It is!
[03:04:57.001 --> 03:04:59.262]  It's a casino meant to rip you off.
[03:04:59.262 --> 03:05:00.783]  Don't be a sucker!

[03:08:33.190 --> 03:08:35.831]  Stock markets worldwide in massive retreat.
[03:08:35.831 --> 03:08:37.952]  There is no way to pay back
[03:08:39.913 --> 03:08:45.318]  The 1.5 quadrillion, 1,500 trillion, that these banks have created.
[03:08:45.318 --> 03:08:48.721]  It is designed to destroy us.
[03:08:48.721 --> 03:08:54.066]  It is a giant lead weight they trick us into connecting ourselves to.
[03:08:54.747 --> 03:08:55.968]  And then they hold us hostage.
[03:08:55.968 --> 03:09:04.474]  If you want the economy to come back, if you want your pension fund, if you want your retirement, you've got to give us, the bankers, even more power over your economy.
[03:09:04.474 --> 03:09:06.676]  You've got to give us trillions more.
[03:09:06.676 --> 03:09:14.922]  And you give them the trillions, and Congress says, and the Parliament of England says, and the EU says to the central banks, where'd the money go?
[03:09:14.922 --> 03:09:17.584]  And they say, we're not going to tell you.
[03:09:17.584 --> 03:09:19.606]  This is a swindle.
[03:09:19.606 --> 03:09:21.327]  But because they're wearing $5,000 designer suits,
[03:09:24.437 --> 03:09:30.501]  And because they control your pension funds, no one goes to jail because they're holding us hostage.
[03:09:30.501 --> 03:09:35.263]  Dow repeats Great Depression pattern.
[03:09:35.263 --> 03:09:36.724]  That's CNBC.
[03:09:36.724 --> 03:09:38.445]  Here's London Telegraph.
[03:09:38.445 --> 03:09:39.766]  With the U.S.
[03:09:39.766 --> 03:09:43.068]  trapped in depression, this really is starting to feel like 1932.
[03:09:43.068 --> 03:09:46.770]  652,000 people lost their jobs in the month of June alone.
[03:09:53.123 --> 03:09:57.226]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've known for four years we've been in a recession.
[03:09:57.226 --> 03:09:59.187]  All the economists we've had on.
[03:09:59.187 --> 03:10:01.629]  You can see it around you in business.
[03:10:01.629 --> 03:10:04.290]  They were telling you the economy was great four years ago.
[03:10:04.290 --> 03:10:07.192]  They've been telling you it's been getting better the last year and a half?
[03:10:07.192 --> 03:10:07.813]  Baloney!
[03:10:09.275 --> 03:10:20.519]  Anyone in business, anyone in the real world, I mean, 46 states on the verge of collapsing according to Bloomberg and the federal government's own admissions.
[03:10:20.519 --> 03:10:21.959]  Is that a recovering country?
[03:10:21.959 --> 03:10:25.420]  46 states on the verge of collapsing.
[03:10:25.420 --> 03:10:30.622]  But the big private mega banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup,
[03:10:32.264 --> 03:10:43.349]  Bank of America, they're all doing good with record profits and taking over everything, so they tell you the economy's great.
[03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:50.191]  And without even looking today, I've got a stack of mainstream news articles about how we're in a depression.
[03:10:50.191 --> 03:10:52.232]  Suddenly they're admitting we're in a depression.
[03:10:52.232 --> 03:10:52.452]  Why?
[03:10:54.480 --> 03:11:09.655]  They're going to scare us again and say, well, you better give the Federal Reserve unlimited power over the entire economy, over every facet of the economy, or they won't be able to fix it.
[03:11:09.655 --> 03:11:10.896]  They told you that a year and a half ago.
[03:11:13.208 --> 03:11:19.214]  Now they can offer their new global currency and their SDR as the solution to the crisis they've created.
[03:11:19.214 --> 03:11:19.675]  That's why.
[03:11:19.675 --> 03:11:20.616]  They've already milked us.
[03:11:20.616 --> 03:11:22.317]  They've already gotten us positioned.
[03:11:22.317 --> 03:11:23.819]  They've got us where they want us.
[03:11:23.819 --> 03:11:27.122]  They wanted to get us deeper into a depression and more in debt to them.
[03:11:27.122 --> 03:11:29.565]  And they've done that now.
[03:11:29.565 --> 03:11:33.329]  And they're coming back saying, gee, we just want to save the economy.
[03:11:36.041 --> 03:11:40.282]  And it is like having a 10-pound tumor growing on the side of your heart.
[03:11:40.282 --> 03:11:42.883]  If we do remove the tumor, it may kill us.
[03:11:42.883 --> 03:11:47.664]  But if we don't remove the tumor, we're dead.
[03:11:47.664 --> 03:11:52.225]  I mean, we're that ingratiated and that integrated in with these crooks.
[03:11:52.225 --> 03:11:55.586]  They've made it where we're dependent on them.
[03:11:55.586 --> 03:11:57.247]  That's the whole ballgame.
[03:11:57.247 --> 03:12:00.828]  A Ponzi scheme that's too big to fail.
[03:12:00.828 --> 03:12:01.928]  That's the name of their game.
[03:12:01.928 --> 03:12:05.289]  A Ponzi scheme, too big to fail, that's designed to fail.
[03:12:06.946 --> 03:12:09.408]  And when it fails, it conquers you economically.
[03:12:09.408 --> 03:12:14.452]  You remember this headline last week?
[03:12:14.452 --> 03:12:15.613]  The Third Depression.
[03:12:15.613 --> 03:12:17.155]  Paul Krugman, New York Times.
[03:12:17.155 --> 03:12:20.858]  Why are... But of course, his answer is giving the government and the Federal Reserve more power and more money.
[03:12:22.093 --> 03:12:23.034]  More spending.
[03:12:23.034 --> 03:12:24.155]  Your money.
[03:12:24.155 --> 03:12:25.015]  And they've already decided.
[03:12:25.015 --> 03:12:31.180]  They're going to devalue the dollar and on its ashes build the new SDR that you pay carbon taxes to.
[03:12:31.180 --> 03:12:35.384]  Think of the magnitude of what's happening right now.
[03:12:35.384 --> 03:12:43.510]  And then I saw stacks of these articles without even looking.
[03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:45.192]  Happy 4th of July.
[03:12:45.192 --> 03:12:46.933]  America needs it.
[03:12:46.933 --> 03:12:51.477]  The great republic is in a perilous state politically and economically.
[03:12:52.759 --> 03:12:58.343]  This is by Jeffrey Simpson from the Saturday Globe and Mail.
[03:12:58.343 --> 03:13:02.106]  We can only hope our American friends enjoy their national holiday weekend.
[03:13:02.106 --> 03:13:07.871]  Let them wave their flags, enjoy their picnics, and show their love of country, because they need a holiday.
[03:13:07.871 --> 03:13:13.315]  And my sister is in England.
[03:13:13.315 --> 03:13:17.098]  She just got out of college, so she's taking the European trip.
[03:13:17.098 --> 03:13:19.500]  And my parents were over 4th of July,
[03:13:21.488 --> 03:13:27.174]  She called to say hi from England and she said, oh, it's so nice.
[03:13:27.174 --> 03:13:31.578]  The Brits are all dressed up like Americans and they're making fun of us and it's fun.
[03:13:32.990 --> 03:13:34.631]  And it's like a cute thing.
[03:13:34.631 --> 03:13:40.033]  And of course, I separately knew the culture and knew that she said it's like they think we're silly.
[03:13:40.033 --> 03:13:41.734]  They like us, but it's like we're dumb.
[03:13:41.734 --> 03:13:42.654]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:13:42.654 --> 03:13:44.515]  We're a big joke.
[03:13:44.515 --> 03:13:51.858]  You see, first, we're blamed for everything in the world, all the wars, all the evil when we've just been the blood supply for the cancer.
[03:13:51.858 --> 03:13:55.280]  And now, Obama wasn't the messianic leader.
[03:13:56.900 --> 03:13:58.201]  Americans are just a joke.
[03:13:58.201 --> 03:14:00.703]  She said, yes, we're just a sad joke now.
[03:14:00.703 --> 03:14:06.527]  And they come over and say, oh, you're a pathetic joke.
[03:14:06.527 --> 03:14:09.850]  See, it's something fun.
[03:14:09.850 --> 03:14:11.691]  I mean, they're slaves over there as well.
[03:14:11.691 --> 03:14:15.754]  And the media makes it into a fun joke to make fun of Americans.
[03:14:15.754 --> 03:14:20.078]  The same corporate media that owns the media over there owns our media.
[03:14:20.078 --> 03:14:21.679]  And they'll put out different flavors.
[03:14:21.679 --> 03:14:24.101]  You know, here people make fun of the French and
[03:14:25.117 --> 03:14:32.979]  How they're pathetic and how they're cowards and all of this baloney.
[03:14:32.979 --> 03:14:34.080]  I need a water, boys.
[03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:39.441]  I'm coughing here.
[03:14:39.441 --> 03:14:40.161]  I found one.
[03:14:40.161 --> 03:14:45.503]  A delicious plastic glass with estrogen mimicking hormones.
[03:14:45.503 --> 03:14:46.063]  Just what I need.
[03:14:51.991 --> 03:14:53.772]  Okay, let me continue to the news here.
[03:14:53.772 --> 03:15:06.216]  I had another little stack of depression news that I'm looking for here.
[03:15:06.216 --> 03:15:08.237]  I'll have to find that during the break.
[03:15:08.237 --> 03:15:19.381]  Let me shift gears here before I get into that list of other news media.
[03:15:21.325 --> 03:15:33.367]  Talking about how America's basically done for, and that's now a popular, popular little sport.
[03:15:33.367 --> 03:15:34.908]  Well here, I found one of them.
[03:15:34.908 --> 03:15:39.569]  Let me go over this report for you.
[03:15:39.569 --> 03:15:44.970]  50 Random Facts That Make You Wonder What In The World Has Happened To America.
[03:15:44.970 --> 03:15:46.830]  This is from the Economic Collapse blog.
[03:15:49.383 --> 03:15:51.550]  So let's go through the 50.
[03:15:51.550 --> 03:15:53.617]  Let's see if we have time.
[03:15:53.617 --> 03:15:55.965]  Number 50, counting down to number one.
[03:15:58.621 --> 03:16:04.665]  A new report released by the United Nations is publicly calling for the establishment of a world currency.
[03:16:04.665 --> 03:16:07.326]  And none of the major news networks are even covering it.
[03:16:07.326 --> 03:16:08.167]  49.
[03:16:08.167 --> 03:16:22.115]  The state of California is so broke that Arnold Schwarzenegger has ordered California's state controller to reduce state workers' pay for July to the federal minimum allowed by law. $7.25.
[03:16:26.834 --> 03:16:27.175]  We're good.
[03:16:39.915 --> 03:16:42.736]  Because she argued with him, didn't touch him.
[03:16:42.736 --> 03:16:45.918]  That tortures what heroes do.
[03:16:45.918 --> 03:16:46.338]  47.
[03:16:46.338 --> 03:16:47.479]  In early 2009, U.S.
[03:16:47.479 --> 03:16:57.864]  net national savings as a percentage of GDP went negative for the first time since 1952, and it was continued in its downward trend since then. 46.
[03:17:00.762 --> 03:17:09.493]  Cor Exit 9500 is so incredibly toxic that the UK's Marine Management Organization has completely banned it.
[03:17:09.493 --> 03:17:14.779]  So if there was a major oil spill in the North Sea, BP would not be able to use it.
[03:17:14.779 --> 03:17:17.542]  And yet BP has dumped over a million gallons
[03:17:18.323 --> 03:17:19.003]  We're good to go.
[03:17:36.277 --> 03:17:38.419]  That's the equivalent of 21st century soup lines.
[03:17:53.613 --> 03:18:00.697]  Charge the cost of 360 golf umbrellas 9,000 to taxpayers.
[03:18:00.697 --> 03:18:07.081]  43 researchers at the State University of New York in Buffalo received $389,000 from the U.S.
[03:18:07.081 --> 03:18:17.368]  government to pay 100 residents of Buffalo $45 each to record how much malt liquor they drink and how much pot they smoke each day.
[03:18:18.848 --> 03:18:18.928]  42.
[03:18:18.928 --> 03:18:25.292]  The average duration of unemployment in the United States has risen to an all-time high.
[03:18:25.292 --> 03:18:25.792]  41.
[03:18:25.792 --> 03:18:28.753]  But Obama says the economy's doing great, though.
[03:18:28.753 --> 03:18:30.294]  Record unemployment.
[03:18:30.294 --> 03:18:33.496]  Record people on food stamps, but everything's fine.
[03:18:33.496 --> 03:18:34.076]  41.
[03:18:34.076 --> 03:18:41.100]  The bottom 40% of all income earners in the United States now collectively own less than 1% of the nation's wealth.
[03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:42.461]  Number 40.
[03:18:42.461 --> 03:18:49.307]  In the U.S., the average federal worker now earns about twice as much as the average worker in the private sector.
[03:18:49.307 --> 03:18:49.667]  39.
[03:18:49.667 --> 03:18:55.332]  Back in 1950, each retiree's Social Security benefit was paid for by 16 workers.
[03:18:55.332 --> 03:19:01.176]  Today, each retiree's Social Security benefit is paid for by approximately 3.3 workers.
[03:19:01.176 --> 03:19:06.341]  By 2025, it is projected that there will be approximately two workers for each retiree.
[03:19:07.557 --> 03:19:08.398]  Number 38.
[03:19:08.398 --> 03:19:09.500]  According to the U.S.
[03:19:09.500 --> 03:19:12.846]  Treasury Department report to Congress, the U.S.
[03:19:12.846 --> 03:19:18.355]  national debt will top $13.6 trillion this year and climb to an estimated $19.6 trillion by 2015.
[03:19:22.435 --> 03:19:24.276]  That's just what the media reports on, folks.
[03:19:24.276 --> 03:19:27.359]  The Washington Post admits $600 trillion in derivatives.
[03:19:27.359 --> 03:19:32.323]  And those bankers claim we will pay for all of that, even though it's not ours.
[03:19:32.323 --> 03:19:32.363]  37.
[03:19:32.363 --> 03:19:39.489]  The federal government actually had the goal to ask for online donations that will supposedly go towards paying off national debt.
[03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:41.921]  36.
[03:19:41.921 --> 03:19:53.534]  The Cactus Bug Project at the University of Florida has allocated $325,000 in economic stimulus funds to study the mating decisions of cactus bugs.
[03:19:53.534 --> 03:19:53.574]  35.
[03:19:53.574 --> 03:19:58.239]  A dinner... We're gonna come back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:58.239 --> 03:19:58.840]  We'll continue.
[03:20:01.926 --> 03:20:03.809]  Don't answer it!
[03:20:03.809 --> 03:20:10.418]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Dead in 90 Days.

[03:20:13.402 --> 03:20:19.490]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:20:19.730 --> 03:20:23.992]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:20:23.992 --> 03:20:31.376]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan, and without attorneys or going to court.

[03:20:49.966 --> 03:20:52.548]  That's ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[03:20:52.548 --> 03:20:54.290]  Or call now for free information.
[03:20:54.290 --> 03:20:54.470]  800-477-9256.
[03:20:54.470 --> 03:20:54.650]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:21:00.723 --> 03:21:10.748]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:21:10.748 --> 03:21:17.191]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[03:21:17.191 --> 03:21:26.035]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:21:26.395 --> 03:21:35.587]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:21:35.587 --> 03:21:40.192]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:21:40.192 --> 03:21:41.995]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:41.995 --> 03:21:44.498]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:21:44.778 --> 03:21:48.102]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[03:21:48.102 --> 03:21:52.286]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[03:21:52.286 --> 03:21:53.027]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[03:21:53.027 --> 03:21:53.367]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:02.808 --> 03:22:04.970]  We're subject to other police action.
[03:22:04.970 --> 03:22:06.231]  Tyranny is here.
[03:22:06.231 --> 03:22:09.974]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:09.974 --> 03:22:12.396]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:12.396 --> 03:22:18.281]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:22:18.281 --> 03:22:24.527]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:24.927 --> 03:22:30.908]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:22:30.908 --> 03:22:35.089]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:22:35.089 --> 03:22:39.370]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:22:39.370 --> 03:22:45.331]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:45.331 --> 03:22:48.871]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:48.871 --> 03:22:50.852]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:50.852 --> 03:22:51.292]  It's here.

[03:23:00.643 --> 03:23:03.666]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:03.666 --> 03:23:08.991]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:08.991 --> 03:23:11.033]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:11.033 --> 03:23:16.038]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:16.038 --> 03:23:17.219]  How much do you want?
[03:23:17.219 --> 03:23:18.361]  When do you want it?
[03:23:18.361 --> 03:23:20.242]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:23:20.242 --> 03:23:21.324]  When will you need it?
[03:23:21.324 --> 03:23:23.526]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:23:23.526 --> 03:23:24.567]  Will there be any food?
[03:23:24.827 --> 03:23:26.368]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:23:26.368 --> 03:23:31.630]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:23:31.630 --> 03:23:35.211]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:23:35.211 --> 03:23:39.033]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:23:39.033 --> 03:23:40.273]  How much will you need?
[03:23:40.273 --> 03:23:41.174]  We don't know.
[03:23:41.174 --> 03:23:42.274]  How much do you want?
[03:23:42.274 --> 03:23:43.015]  All you can get.
[03:23:43.015 --> 03:23:43.995]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:23:44.275 --> 03:23:47.337]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:23:47.337 --> 03:23:49.438]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:23:49.438 --> 03:23:54.881]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:54.881 --> 03:23:55.821]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:23:55.821 --> 03:24:11.170]  Alright, I'm going to try to race through more of these 50 random facts that make you wonder what in the world has happened to America.
[03:24:12.910 --> 03:24:15.272]  Of course, I would add a few of my own.
[03:24:15.272 --> 03:24:28.003]  Why is the government now openly admitting they put microphones up everywhere, putting our public comments in parks, in malls, through NSA databases?
[03:24:28.003 --> 03:24:30.806]  That's coming up after I take calls in the next segment.
[03:24:30.806 --> 03:24:34.049]  I'm gonna get into the police state stack of news from today.
[03:24:39.306 --> 03:24:50.229]  A dinner cruise company in Chicago got nearly one million in economic stimulus funds to combat terrorism.
[03:24:50.229 --> 03:24:57.911]  Number 34, it is being reported that a six-year-old girl from Ohio is on the no-fly list maintained by U.S.
[03:24:57.911 --> 03:25:01.312]  Homeland Security, and they refuse to take her off.
[03:25:01.312 --> 03:25:05.673]  It's about it being absurd, where you just accept that they do whatever they want.
[03:25:08.493 --> 03:25:09.293]  Number 33.
[03:25:09.293 --> 03:25:22.818]  During the first quarter of 2010, the total number of loans that are at least three months past due in the United States increased for the 16th consecutive quarter to an all-time record, I would add.
[03:25:22.818 --> 03:25:23.179]  32.
[03:25:23.179 --> 03:25:31.802]  According to a new report, Americans spend twice as much as residents of other developed countries on health care, but get lower quality and far less efficiency.
[03:25:33.032 --> 03:25:35.856]  Well, government just took it over, so it's gonna get a lot worse.
[03:25:35.856 --> 03:25:42.865]  And they've now admitted, in the AP, The Hill, Obama has admitted, oh, I'm sorry, you don't get free healthcare.
[03:25:42.865 --> 03:25:47.030]  We make you buy healthcare of your poor.
[03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.411]  I'm sorry.
[03:25:50.199 --> 03:25:51.400]  Here's another one.
[03:25:51.400 --> 03:25:54.163]  Well, yeah, for at least 6-7 years they've had cloned chickens.
[03:26:10.771 --> 03:26:12.493]  and cloned cow meat.
[03:26:12.493 --> 03:26:15.195]  I mean, you've been eating it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:26:15.195 --> 03:26:24.123]  The FDA has announced that offspring of cloned animals could be in our food supply right now, and that there's nothing that they can do about it.
[03:26:24.123 --> 03:26:26.946]  Yeah, but if you don't pay one nickel of taxes, they're gonna come.
[03:26:26.946 --> 03:26:29.148]  But, oh, we can't do anything about the cloned animals.
[03:26:29.148 --> 03:26:36.175]  We can harass Amish people and arrest people that get caught all over the country selling eggs on the street corner that they
[03:26:37.423 --> 03:26:39.544]  Got from their own chickens.
[03:26:39.544 --> 03:26:44.707]  But we can't stop big agribusiness from giving you clone food.
[03:26:44.707 --> 03:26:46.448]  Continuing.
[03:26:46.448 --> 03:26:51.771]  In May, sales of new homes in the United States dropped the lowest level ever recorded.
[03:26:51.771 --> 03:26:53.212]  And that's even with cooked federal numbers.
[03:26:54.876 --> 03:27:03.283]  Continuing, uh, 28, in 1950, the ratio of the average executive paycheck to the average worker's paycheck was about 30 to 1.
[03:27:03.283 --> 03:27:06.145]  Since the year 2000, the ratio has been arranged between 300 to 500 to 1.
[03:27:09.363 --> 03:27:23.846]  Number 27, federal border officials recently said that Mexican drug cartels have not only set up shop on Arizona soil, they're actually maintaining lookout bases in strategic locations in the hills of southern Arizona as much as 80 miles into the United States.
[03:27:23.846 --> 03:27:26.046]  And that's back in the news today.
[03:27:26.046 --> 03:27:29.627]  Huge border wars in Texas and Arizona over the weekend.
[03:27:29.627 --> 03:27:36.648]  And if Americans now go down major highways, Mexican troops and cartels actually stop them and steal everything they've got.
[03:27:37.208 --> 03:27:38.629]  And the police refuse to even help.
[03:27:38.629 --> 03:27:42.412]  I mean, it's just total collapse of society.
[03:27:42.412 --> 03:27:43.994]  The globalists love it.
[03:27:43.994 --> 03:27:44.574]  The U.S.
[03:27:44.574 --> 03:27:47.536]  government has declared some parts of Arizona off-limits to U.S.
[03:27:47.536 --> 03:27:47.977]  citizens.
[03:27:47.977 --> 03:27:52.320]  That's number 26, because of the threat of violence from Mexican drug smugglers.
[03:27:52.320 --> 03:27:53.962]  Number 25, we're halfway through.
[03:27:53.962 --> 03:27:58.766]  And every one of these I read, I can think of 10 or 15 things even worse that are going on.
[03:28:00.417 --> 03:28:12.387]  25, according to the credit card repayment calculator, if you owe $6,000 on a credit card with a 20% interest rate and only pay a minimum payment each time, it will take you 54 years to pay off the credit card.
[03:28:12.387 --> 03:28:22.315]  During those 54 years, you will pay $26,168 in interest rate changes in addition to the $6,000 in principal that you are required to pay back.
[03:28:22.315 --> 03:28:23.096]  So you'll pay $22,000 plus.
[03:28:27.428 --> 03:28:32.014]  Yeah, $23,000 plus... No, no, $33,000.
[03:28:32.014 --> 03:28:33.235]  $26,000 and $6,000.
[03:28:33.235 --> 03:28:36.059]  So you'll be paying over $30,000.
[03:28:36.059 --> 03:28:39.863]  That's kind of like, you know, the central banks.
[03:28:39.863 --> 03:28:42.726]  They owe a billion dollars to somebody they made up.
[03:28:42.726 --> 03:28:44.208]  They end up paying back $50 billion.
[03:28:44.208 --> 03:28:45.189]  They still owe $50 billion.
[03:28:45.189 --> 03:28:45.990]  That's like Nigeria.
[03:28:45.990 --> 03:28:46.851]  I love to use that example.
[03:28:48.072 --> 03:28:48.132]  24.
[03:28:48.132 --> 03:29:05.477]  According to prepared testimony by Goldman Sachs Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs shorted roughly $615 million of the collateralized debt obligations and residual mortgage-backed securities the firm underwrote since late 2006.
[03:29:05.477 --> 03:29:09.458]  And that's just one report on one Timberwolf transaction.
[03:29:09.458 --> 03:29:15.300]  Yeah, they were betting against what they were selling their clients.
[03:29:15.300 --> 03:29:16.520]  That's their whole business model.
[03:29:17.875 --> 03:29:26.085]  Number 23, the six biggest banks in the United States now possess assets equivalent to 60% of America's gross national product.
[03:29:26.085 --> 03:29:27.947]  And when they're done, they'll have over 100%.
[03:29:27.947 --> 03:29:30.210]  How is that possible?
[03:29:30.210 --> 03:29:36.298]  They'll own everything, and you'll owe them a bunch of interest on it, so it'll be more.
[03:29:37.867 --> 03:29:41.371]  I mean, it's like they've made 600 trillion dollars in made-up derivatives.
[03:29:41.371 --> 03:29:44.935]  I'm gonna run through the rest of these, go to your calls, and hit some police state news.
[03:29:44.935 --> 03:29:46.136]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:29:46.136 --> 03:29:47.137]  Long segment coming up.
[03:29:47.137 --> 03:29:51.382]  Ton of key info.
[03:29:51.382 --> 03:29:52.784]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.784 --> 03:29:55.307]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.307 --> 03:29:58.010]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.731 --> 03:30:05.273]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:30:05.273 --> 03:30:06.194]  Number 1.
[03:30:06.194 --> 03:30:09.616]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:30:09.616 --> 03:30:10.476]  Number 2.
[03:30:10.476 --> 03:30:15.359]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:30:15.359 --> 03:30:16.099]  It's true.
[03:30:16.099 --> 03:30:20.982]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:30:20.982 --> 03:30:21.802]  Number 3.
[03:30:21.802 --> 03:30:25.384]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:30:25.384 --> 03:30:29.086]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:30:29.286 --> 03:30:30.087]  Number 4.
[03:30:30.087 --> 03:30:32.850]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:30:32.850 --> 03:30:36.534]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:30:36.534 --> 03:30:37.315]  Number 5.
[03:30:37.315 --> 03:30:41.480]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:30:41.480 --> 03:30:46.245]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:30:46.525 --> 03:30:50.690]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:50.690 --> 03:30:52.471]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[03:31:02.318 --> 03:31:05.701]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[03:31:24.657 --> 03:31:31.162]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[03:31:31.162 --> 03:31:32.664]  Buy American and stay clean.

[03:31:52.727 --> 03:31:53.227]  Thank you!
[03:32:00.302 --> 03:32:02.685]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:32:02.685 --> 03:32:04.908]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:32:04.908 --> 03:32:08.232]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:32:08.232 --> 03:32:13.339]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:32:13.339 --> 03:32:17.525]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:32:17.825 --> 03:32:20.167]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:32:20.167 --> 03:32:22.728]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:32:22.728 --> 03:32:25.990]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:32:25.990 --> 03:32:33.575]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:32:33.928 --> 03:32:39.313]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:32:39.313 --> 03:32:41.636]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:32:41.636 --> 03:32:45.860]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:32:45.860 --> 03:32:46.921]  And I got news for you.
[03:32:46.921 --> 03:32:48.262]  You're everyone else.
[03:32:48.262 --> 03:32:49.763]  Invisible Empire.

[03:33:09.238 --> 03:33:16.585]  I don't know if we'll have time to play this, but it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPanda.com.
[03:33:16.585 --> 03:33:21.209]  Anderson Cooper saying the First Amendment is dead.
[03:33:21.209 --> 03:33:29.057]  And then going over how, even, I've got a frontline story here of a photographer they'd hired.
[03:33:30.967 --> 03:33:35.630]  To go down to Texas City and take photos of the BP refinery.
[03:33:35.630 --> 03:33:40.213]  This is the same one that had a big leak a few years ago and they got a big fine over it.
[03:33:40.213 --> 03:33:47.657]  And the cops showed up and they said, we don't care, you don't take photos in America.
[03:33:47.657 --> 03:33:51.119]  I was coming back from the beach about a year ago.
[03:33:51.119 --> 03:33:55.002]  And this was down in Corpus Christi.
[03:33:55.002 --> 03:33:56.283]  I was coming back from Port Aransas.
[03:33:57.561 --> 03:34:03.902]  And I was getting on an access road and saw this big refinery and I said, you know, I always need B-roll for my films.
[03:34:03.902 --> 03:34:09.244]  And I want to expose how the carbon tax is meant to shut down our society.
[03:34:09.244 --> 03:34:15.465]  And I might mention that the big oil companies are actually financing it and that they got together in 96.
[03:34:15.465 --> 03:34:17.866]  This has been declassified.
[03:34:17.866 --> 03:34:19.186]  Well, not declassified.
[03:34:19.186 --> 03:34:22.707]  The AP, Associated Press, sued
[03:34:23.877 --> 03:34:25.999]  And got those minutes in 2000.
[03:34:25.999 --> 03:34:28.841]  We've written articles about it and covered it.
[03:34:28.841 --> 03:34:30.322]  If you want to go pull the stories up.
[03:34:31.212 --> 03:34:41.415]  Where they shut down all of the refineries that they didn't own or bought them up and closed them to create an artificial bottleneck because there's too much oil.
[03:34:41.415 --> 03:34:42.695]  And so they want to keep prices up.
[03:34:42.695 --> 03:34:43.736]  How do they do that?
[03:34:43.736 --> 03:34:45.796]  They shut down refining capacity.
[03:34:45.796 --> 03:34:50.378]  They fund environmental groups who go out and lobby against it.
[03:34:50.378 --> 03:34:54.119]  And then they themselves sit back and make fun of the very groups they financed.
[03:34:54.119 --> 03:34:58.080]  I mean, this is on record.
[03:34:58.080 --> 03:35:00.341]  So that's how they create that artificial scarcity.
[03:35:01.454 --> 03:35:11.605]  And I, this is no exaggeration, I pulled up by that big refinery right before you get on 37 to go north.
[03:35:11.605 --> 03:35:22.576]  I pulled up, I got out with a video camera on a tripod and filmed the refinery.
[03:35:22.576 --> 03:35:23.717]  I cut down a side street.
[03:35:24.807 --> 03:35:25.107]  I don't know.
[03:35:47.170 --> 03:35:56.115]  Entrance ramp was a Texas State Police officer who got right up on my butt, ran my plates, put me in a database, then peeled off.
[03:35:56.115 --> 03:35:57.636]  Didn't pull me over.
[03:35:57.636 --> 03:36:01.758]  That is infrastructure protection.
[03:36:01.758 --> 03:36:05.180]  They're watching everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:36:05.180 --> 03:36:11.023]  And they tell those poor state police guys, Al-Qaeda is going to blow up the chemical plant.
[03:36:11.023 --> 03:36:14.145]  Give me a break.
[03:36:14.145 --> 03:36:15.986]  But they can't stop the open border.
[03:36:19.881 --> 03:36:29.710]  So the same thing happened to this PBS photographer, and that's in the news, but I'm already burning time up here, and I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[03:36:29.710 --> 03:36:42.201]  I'm gonna at least get to Tim, Ron, Michael, Pastor, and Coyote, but be ready with your points, folks, because I've got to get to this police state news, but continuing here.
[03:36:42.201 --> 03:36:43.742]  Okay, what number had I gotten to?
[03:36:48.089 --> 03:36:54.073]  The six biggest banks in the United States now possess assets equivalent to 60% of America's gross national product.
[03:36:54.073 --> 03:36:55.774]  Number 22, four of the biggest U.S.
[03:36:55.774 --> 03:37:04.079]  banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, had a perfect quarter with zero days of trading losses during the first quarter of 2010.
[03:37:04.079 --> 03:37:08.082]  Yeah, it's completely rigged.
[03:37:08.082 --> 03:37:12.785]  These companies are the CIA.
[03:37:12.785 --> 03:37:15.567]  Or properly said, the CIA is Goldman Sachs.
[03:37:16.874 --> 03:37:21.356]  You notice the Russians didn't infiltrate the government.
[03:37:21.356 --> 03:37:26.998]  They infiltrated Harvard and Goldman Sachs and Wall Street.
[03:37:26.998 --> 03:37:29.199]  They're agents of influence.
[03:37:29.199 --> 03:37:30.980]  And the media is saying, well, they should be let go.
[03:37:30.980 --> 03:37:36.942]  Yeah, they're illegal aliens who had fake names and probably were spies, but they just wanted to be bankers' friends.
[03:37:36.942 --> 03:37:40.924]  Well, you don't infiltrate the government.
[03:37:40.924 --> 03:37:45.226]  The congressmen are all like fish on a trotline hook to the bankers.
[03:37:47.059 --> 03:37:50.952]  So you cozy up to them, the dirtbags.
[03:37:50.952 --> 03:37:52.537]  They've already taken America over.
[03:37:54.673 --> 03:37:56.094]  See how this is all hidden in plain view?
[03:37:56.094 --> 03:38:03.997]  1.41 million Americans filed for personal bankruptcy in 2009, a 32% increase over 08.
[03:38:03.997 --> 03:38:10.059]  BP has hired private security contractors to keep American people away from oil cleanup sites, and nobody seems to care.
[03:38:10.059 --> 03:38:12.340]  Number 20, yeah, the cops just follow orders.
[03:38:12.340 --> 03:38:13.781]  There's no law.
[03:38:13.781 --> 03:38:17.402]  Just like there's no law, Obama can tell the states they can't clean up the oil.
[03:38:17.402 --> 03:38:19.643]  But everybody just bootlecks.
[03:38:19.643 --> 03:38:22.144]  Oh, you say you have authority?
[03:38:22.144 --> 03:38:23.625]  Take my farm, take my ranch.
[03:38:26.701 --> 03:38:36.747]  Barack Obama, number 19, is calling for a civilian expeditionary force to be sent to Afghanistan and Iraq to help overburdened military troops build infrastructure.
[03:38:36.747 --> 03:38:41.530]  And he's calling for a draft, just like his chief of staff is, Rahm Emanuel.
[03:38:41.530 --> 03:38:42.530]  Oh, don't believe me?
[03:38:42.530 --> 03:38:45.092]  Just go search engine, Rahm Emanuel calls for national draft.
[03:38:46.169 --> 03:38:55.394]  On June 18th, two Christians decided that they would peacefully pass out copies of the Gospel of John on a public sidewalk outside of an Arab festival in Dearborn, Michigan.
[03:38:55.394 --> 03:38:59.316]  And within three minutes, eight policemen surrounded them and placed them under arrest, number 18.
[03:38:59.316 --> 03:39:03.858]  And this story has links to mainstream news everywhere.
[03:39:03.858 --> 03:39:05.139]  See, it's all over.
[03:39:05.139 --> 03:39:09.401]  You come to a town that's Muslim, no free speech if they don't like what you say.
[03:39:09.401 --> 03:39:13.203]  You come to a town that's mainly Jewish, no free speech if you talk bad about Jews.
[03:39:14.023 --> 03:39:19.670]  You come to a town where, you know, it's run by Baptists, you talk bad about the Baptist Church, you get arrested.
[03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:24.596]  I mean, this is a mirror into how censorship and tyranny works.
[03:39:24.596 --> 03:39:31.986]  And then the feds come in and take over your town, which they're doing, and whatever they say they don't like you to say is now illegal, as Cass Sunstein calls for.
[03:39:34.298 --> 03:39:43.521]  I mean, here's America, open to the whole world, and you go to Dearborn, Michigan, and they got the minarets up and the call to prayer and everything, and what, Christians aren't allowed to be on the street handing out flyers?
[03:39:43.521 --> 03:39:45.441]  Christians aren't allowed to in Dallas?
[03:39:45.441 --> 03:39:50.943]  Daryl Runders has been arrested repeatedly for standing on the sidewalk handing out flyers in America.
[03:39:50.943 --> 03:39:54.424]  Because it's Americans they've gotta keep down.
[03:39:54.424 --> 03:40:00.266]  It's anybody trying, you know, the system says, my gosh, somebody actually involved trying to be out here in free speech?
[03:40:00.266 --> 03:40:03.807]  We better make them shut up, because mafia runs this country.
[03:40:04.943 --> 03:40:08.346]  You don't let slaves get out there and speak to others.
[03:40:08.346 --> 03:40:18.635]  Those little puny ants outnumber the globalist 100 to one, and if they ever figure that out, it's over for the grasshoppers.
[03:40:18.635 --> 03:40:19.776]  I can't believe that story.
[03:40:19.776 --> 03:40:26.762]  In fact, I want to get those Christians on who couldn't hand out flyers outside the Dearborn, Michigan facility.
[03:40:26.762 --> 03:40:30.265]  The cops don't care if they're on a sidewalk and it's America and there's free speech.
[03:40:30.265 --> 03:40:30.625]  They arrest you.
[03:40:34.312 --> 03:40:36.633]  They were arrested for the free speech!
[03:40:36.633 --> 03:40:46.776]  17, it's been reported that sales of foreclosed homes in Florida made up nearly 40% of all home purchases in the past part of the year.
[03:40:46.776 --> 03:40:48.677]  Yeah, the banks are buying it up.
[03:40:48.677 --> 03:40:51.238]  Somebody put 200 grand in a house, they get it for 5,000.
[03:40:51.238 --> 03:41:01.382]  During a recent interview with Larry King, former First Lady Laura Bush revealed that the world that she is actually in favor of legalized gay marriages and a woman's right for abortion.
[03:41:01.382 --> 03:41:02.442]  Well, they're not conservatives.
[03:41:03.732 --> 03:41:15.716]  Number 15, scientists at Columbia University are warning that the dose of radiation from the new full-body scanners going into airports all over the country could be up to 20 times higher than originally estimated.
[03:41:15.716 --> 03:41:17.377]  I told you that two years ago.
[03:41:17.377 --> 03:41:19.518]  It's meant to fry your DNA.
[03:41:19.518 --> 03:41:21.739]  It's targeting your ovaries and your testicles.
[03:41:21.739 --> 03:41:24.620]  It's high-powered.
[03:41:24.620 --> 03:41:26.020]  And they're recording it.
[03:41:26.020 --> 03:41:26.861]  You don't care, though.
[03:41:26.861 --> 03:41:29.442]  Your religion is submitting to tyranny.
[03:41:29.442 --> 03:41:32.863]  I'm surprised people don't go in there naked saying, please, kill me.
[03:41:35.953 --> 03:41:39.535]  And again, that's scientists at Columbia University, and there's a bunch of other studies saying that.
[03:41:39.535 --> 03:41:41.095]  They don't care.
[03:41:41.095 --> 03:41:43.257]  14.
[03:41:43.257 --> 03:41:48.299]  43% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement.
[03:41:48.299 --> 03:41:55.662]  The FDIC's deposit insurance fund now has negative $20.7 million in it, which represents a slight improvement from the end of 2009.
[03:41:57.725 --> 03:42:13.974]  Number 12, the judge that BP is pushing to hear the estimated 200 lawsuits to the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster gets tens of thousands of dollars a year in oil royalties and has paid travel expenses to industry conferences by BP.
[03:42:13.974 --> 03:42:16.095]  See, corruption is now the law.
[03:42:16.095 --> 03:42:18.236]  Evil is law.
[03:42:18.236 --> 03:42:19.817]  Evil is law.
[03:42:19.817 --> 03:42:23.799]  Degeneracy and wickedness is what's protected.
[03:42:23.799 --> 03:42:25.741]  Goodness is bad.
[03:42:25.741 --> 03:42:26.341]  You understand that?
[03:42:28.387 --> 03:42:31.891]  Because crooks run everything, and they don't like anybody that gets uppity.
[03:42:31.891 --> 03:42:34.534]  It's about all keeping the slaves down.
[03:42:34.534 --> 03:42:36.376]  Not scaring off the fish, you know.
[03:42:36.376 --> 03:42:38.959]  The globalists are basically like fishermen.
[03:42:38.959 --> 03:42:41.723]  They're like, don't bang your oar on the boat.
[03:42:41.723 --> 03:42:44.586]  We're catching these little suckers.
[03:42:44.586 --> 03:42:46.068]  These little stupid little fishies.
[03:42:49.366 --> 03:42:50.708]  Listen to this.
[03:42:50.708 --> 03:42:51.769]  In recent years, the U.S.
[03:42:51.769 --> 03:43:06.007]  government has spent $2.6 million to study the drinking habits of Chinese prostitutes and $400,000 to pay researchers to cruise six bars in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to find out why gay men engage in risky sexual behavior when drunk.
[03:43:06.892 --> 03:43:10.034]  That's probably figuring out how to put bio weapons in their food or something.
[03:43:10.034 --> 03:43:10.735]  You never know.
[03:43:10.735 --> 03:43:12.976]  I mean, you know, they'll hire somebody for a weird study.
[03:43:12.976 --> 03:43:13.897]  They don't know why they're doing it.
[03:43:13.897 --> 03:43:17.640]  And that's used by the CIA later to carry out some type of operation.
[03:43:17.640 --> 03:43:20.121]  That was just randomly throwing out, you know, a possibility.
[03:43:20.121 --> 03:43:22.363]  I'm not saying that's what's happening here.
[03:43:22.363 --> 03:43:24.705]  I'm saying it's been declassified.
[03:43:24.705 --> 03:43:31.890]  They used gay men getting hepatitis shots in New York in the seventies to give them the HIV because they knew they would spread it.
[03:43:36.954 --> 03:43:39.658]  Okay, continuing here.
[03:43:39.658 --> 03:43:40.539]  Number 10, U.S.
[03:43:40.539 --> 03:43:46.507]  officials say more than $3 billion in cash, much of it aid money paid by U.S.
[03:43:46.507 --> 03:43:51.875]  taxpayers, has been stolen by corrupt officials in Afghanistan and flown out to Kabul International Airport in recent years.
[03:43:51.875 --> 03:43:53.757]  Well, that's all by design.
[03:43:55.231 --> 03:43:56.692]  They openly grow the opium over there.
[03:43:56.692 --> 03:43:57.732]  The troops grow it.
[03:43:57.732 --> 03:43:58.172]  Number 9.
[03:43:58.172 --> 03:43:59.432]  According to a report by U.S.
[03:43:59.432 --> 03:44:04.814]  Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the baggage check fees collected by U.S.
[03:44:04.814 --> 03:44:11.497]  airlines shot up 33% in the first quarter of 2010 to $769 million.
[03:44:11.497 --> 03:44:12.317]  Number 3.
[03:44:12.317 --> 03:44:23.100]  California high school students are fighting for their right to show their American patriotism, even on a Mexican holiday, after they were forced to remove their American flag t-shirts on Cinco de Mayo.
[03:44:23.100 --> 03:44:24.581]  That's now been happening nationwide.
[03:44:26.515 --> 03:44:28.857]  Number seven, right now, interest in U.S.
[03:44:28.857 --> 03:44:38.124]  national debt and spending on entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare are somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 15 percent of the GDP.
[03:44:38.124 --> 03:44:42.568]  By 2080, they were projected to eat up approximately 50 percent of the GDP.
[03:44:42.568 --> 03:44:47.992]  Number six, the total of government and corporate consumer debt in the United States is now at 360 percent of GDP.
[03:44:51.800 --> 03:44:55.422]  You understand it's three times GDP plus.
[03:44:55.422 --> 03:45:02.567]  Number five, a six-year-old girl was recently handcuffed and sent to a mental facility after throwing temper tantrums in her elementary school.
[03:45:02.567 --> 03:45:12.573]  Number four, in Florida, students have been arrested by police for things as simple as bringing a plastic butter knife to school, throwing an eraser, or drawing a picture of a gun.
[03:45:12.573 --> 03:45:14.634]  Oh, yeah.
[03:45:14.634 --> 03:45:19.217]  Number three, school officials in one town in Massachusetts are refusing to allow students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
[03:45:20.526 --> 03:45:28.173]  Number two, according to one new study, approximately 21% of children in the United States are living below the poverty level.
[03:45:28.173 --> 03:45:34.859]  Since 1973, more than 50 million babies have been murdered in abortion facilities across the United States.
[03:45:34.859 --> 03:45:37.741]  See, if they can sell you abortion, they can sell you anything.
[03:45:37.741 --> 03:45:39.363]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[03:45:39.363 --> 03:45:41.925]  Tim in Michigan, you're on the air.
[03:45:41.925 --> 03:45:42.926]  Hey Alex.
[03:45:42.926 --> 03:45:44.187]  Hey buddy.
[03:45:44.187 --> 03:45:46.349]  Hey man, thanks for taking my call again.
[03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.669]  Listen,
[03:45:48.154 --> 03:45:51.617]  First off, I got three things I really want to cover.
[03:45:51.617 --> 03:46:11.393]  There was a interview that Bill Clinton gave, who he was just totally giving BPs of props, and his exact statement was, I can't wait to get into your gas tank.
[03:46:14.540 --> 03:46:19.529]  Whoever found this well from BP knew exactly what they were doing.
[03:46:19.529 --> 03:46:20.891]  This thing is a gusher.
[03:46:20.891 --> 03:46:26.521]  He never talked about the people.
[03:46:28.214 --> 03:46:40.659]  You affected the economy, you never talked about... No, it's all... Listen, we played a clip of Obama earlier, even though they admit all these people are dying, getting sick, almost all the people from the Exxon Valdez are dead.
[03:46:40.659 --> 03:46:43.320]  They know it's very toxic to have people cleaning this up.
[03:46:43.320 --> 03:46:50.062]  Now it's going to come into shore and Obama's on TV saying no ill health effects, no problems, just lying.
[03:46:50.062 --> 03:46:51.343]  What's the name of that video, Tim?
[03:46:53.050 --> 03:47:05.040]  I'm not exactly sure, but if you Google Bill Clinton giving interview for BP, I'm sure it'll pop up on YouTube.
[03:47:05.040 --> 03:47:06.782]  Okay, we'll try to get it posted.
[03:47:06.782 --> 03:47:07.763]  Thank you, Tim.
[03:47:07.763 --> 03:47:09.124]  Ron in Arizona, you're on the air.
[03:47:09.124 --> 03:47:11.366]  Go ahead, Ron.
[03:47:11.366 --> 03:47:15.509]  Good afternoon, Alex and Patriots.
[03:47:15.509 --> 03:47:19.493]  They haven't been spraying chemtrails in Pescot, Arizona.
[03:47:20.080 --> 03:47:20.681]  I don't know.
[03:47:29.102 --> 03:47:31.083]  He is not an American citizen.
[03:47:31.083 --> 03:47:36.286]  He is a foreign agent working for the international banksters.
[03:47:36.286 --> 03:47:39.108]  I agree, but it's espionage.
[03:47:39.108 --> 03:47:41.049]  And if people get one message, it's this.
[03:47:41.049 --> 03:47:42.670]  Globalism is tyranny.
[03:47:42.670 --> 03:47:46.812]  It is foreign banking, corporate takeovers through fraud.
[03:47:46.812 --> 03:47:48.433]  It is espionage.
[03:47:48.433 --> 03:47:51.875]  And so all these corporate officials that are here in the U.S.
[03:47:52.395 --> 03:48:02.920]  Conspiring to defraud the taxpayers are enemy operatives and they need to be seized immediately and given a trial and then they need to be dealt with.
[03:48:02.920 --> 03:48:03.821]  Go ahead.
[03:48:03.821 --> 03:48:05.662]  I agree with you, Alex.
[03:48:05.662 --> 03:48:16.327]  I just asked you to make that point clear because he is a foreign agent working for foreign banksters who are trying to destroy this country.
[03:48:16.327 --> 03:48:20.389]  And the last thing is there's an ancient Hebrew saying that goes, quote,
[03:48:22.023 --> 03:48:26.247]  Oh my people, those who oppress you are children and women rule over you.
[03:48:26.247 --> 03:48:37.376]  Oh my people, those who guide you lead you astray and confuse the path and confuse your path.
[03:48:37.376 --> 03:48:49.466]  What we need to do in this country is get the women out of Congress, put men back in and quit relying on women to save us because the Bible says that is not going to save us.
[03:48:50.250 --> 03:48:51.872]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[03:48:51.872 --> 03:48:52.754]  I know this.
[03:48:52.754 --> 03:48:55.317]  There are a lot of really smart, intelligent women.
[03:48:55.317 --> 03:48:57.120]  There are women smarter than I am.
[03:48:57.120 --> 03:48:59.503]  A lot smarter.
[03:48:59.503 --> 03:49:00.705]  But men and women are different.
[03:49:04.025 --> 03:49:07.727]  There has never been a society that has done the things we're doing that survived.
[03:49:07.727 --> 03:49:08.728]  And we're going to collapse.
[03:49:08.728 --> 03:49:10.529]  I mean, people don't like to hear it.
[03:49:10.529 --> 03:49:12.110]  They don't like to know it.
[03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:16.633]  But human society is supposed to work a certain way.
[03:49:16.633 --> 03:49:18.054]  And it's been destroyed.
[03:49:18.054 --> 03:49:19.475]  And the family's gone.
[03:49:19.475 --> 03:49:20.376]  No one's secure.
[03:49:20.376 --> 03:49:26.140]  Our women under feminism have been turned into totally insecure trollops, dressed up like whores.
[03:49:26.140 --> 03:49:28.501]  Our children are dying and on drugs.
[03:49:28.501 --> 03:49:30.002]  And we're destroyed.
[03:49:30.002 --> 03:49:33.365]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[03:49:34.165 --> 03:49:36.726]  It's not that women are bad.
[03:49:36.726 --> 03:49:38.466]  Any more bad than men.
[03:49:38.466 --> 03:49:41.507]  It's that women want security.
[03:49:41.507 --> 03:49:48.510]  And women tend to, in history, be very trusting of government.
[03:49:48.510 --> 03:49:50.830]  And they statistically are today.
[03:49:50.830 --> 03:49:55.672]  And so, over 80% of purchases are decided by women.
[03:49:55.672 --> 03:49:56.832]  What color is the furniture?
[03:49:56.832 --> 03:49:58.193]  What color are the drapes?
[03:49:58.193 --> 03:49:59.173]  What brand of milk?
[03:49:59.173 --> 03:50:00.173]  What brand of eggs?
[03:50:00.173 --> 03:50:02.074]  I mean, women make the... My wife!
[03:50:03.191 --> 03:50:04.912]  Makes almost all the decisions.
[03:50:04.912 --> 03:50:06.653]  I'm here working, working on this.
[03:50:06.653 --> 03:50:09.795]  My wife probably makes 90% of the decisions.
[03:50:09.795 --> 03:50:13.037]  And if somebody could get control of my wife, they'd run my house.
[03:50:13.037 --> 03:50:15.579]  They would run my life.
[03:50:15.579 --> 03:50:20.742]  And that's why Hitler said, first you get the women, you got the children, so follow the men.
[03:50:20.742 --> 03:50:22.964]  That's an exact quotation.
[03:50:22.964 --> 03:50:25.005]  And Goebbels was obsessed with it.
[03:50:25.005 --> 03:50:27.607]  First you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[03:50:29.324 --> 03:50:31.246]  And they've got the women, folks.
[03:50:31.246 --> 03:50:37.653]  I mean, the women support the CPS because they think, oh, the CPS is helping the children.
[03:50:37.653 --> 03:50:41.977]  Meanwhile, the CPS is hunting women, hunting, you know, taking their kids.
[03:50:41.977 --> 03:50:42.498]  It's admitted.
[03:50:45.034 --> 03:50:50.657]  And it doesn't mean men aren't lazy and gullible and dumb, it's just that there's a natural order of things.
[03:50:50.657 --> 03:50:53.159]  And so don't worry, America's going completely down.
[03:50:53.159 --> 03:51:00.623]  We're all completely screwed, and it'll be a bunch of people like Andrew Napolitano and all those hunchbacked women they got in the Supreme Court ruling us.
[03:51:01.323 --> 03:51:10.531]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[03:51:10.531 --> 03:51:14.094]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[03:51:14.094 --> 03:51:23.682]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[03:51:23.682 --> 03:51:28.947]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[03:51:29.227 --> 03:51:44.671]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance, and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold, and guns, with absolutely no apologies.
[03:51:44.671 --> 03:51:49.312]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[03:51:49.312 --> 03:51:49.752]  That's right.
[03:51:49.912 --> 03:51:50.393]  We're good to go.
[03:52:01.567 --> 03:52:06.531]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:52:06.531 --> 03:52:07.531]  What have we got?
[03:52:07.531 --> 03:52:09.973]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:52:09.973 --> 03:52:10.994]  A republic.
[03:52:10.994 --> 03:52:13.636]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:52:13.636 --> 03:52:15.898]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:52:15.898 --> 03:52:17.919]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:52:17.919 --> 03:52:19.600]  So they think they own our land?
[03:52:19.600 --> 03:52:20.921]  They think they own our water?
[03:52:20.921 --> 03:52:21.522]  Children?
[03:52:21.522 --> 03:52:22.663]  Our education?
[03:52:22.663 --> 03:52:23.483]  Our money?
[03:52:23.483 --> 03:52:27.146]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:52:27.506 --> 03:52:31.191]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:52:31.191 --> 03:52:32.473]  You are being warned.
[03:52:32.473 --> 03:52:33.494]  We have the facts.
[03:52:33.494 --> 03:52:34.656]  We have the Constitution.
[03:52:34.656 --> 03:52:35.557]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:52:35.557 --> 03:52:36.458]  We have common law.
[03:52:36.458 --> 03:52:38.982]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:38.982 --> 03:52:42.747]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:52:42.847 --> 03:52:47.813]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:52:47.813 --> 03:52:49.315]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:52:49.315 --> 03:52:50.396]  Don't tread on me.
[03:52:50.396 --> 03:52:57.264]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:53:02.130 --> 03:53:03.992]  Don't answer it!
[03:53:03.992 --> 03:53:12.099]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[03:53:12.099 --> 03:53:13.580]  800-477-9256.
[03:53:13.580 --> 03:53:19.686]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:53:19.926 --> 03:53:24.187]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[03:53:55.597 --> 03:53:56.278]  800-477-9256.
[03:53:56.278 --> 03:53:57.818]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:53:57.818 --> 03:54:06.502]  Look at this AP headline.
[03:54:06.502 --> 03:54:10.604]  Army drops PsyOps name from Influence Operations.
[03:54:10.604 --> 03:54:15.186]  The Army has dropped the Vietnam era name Psychological Operations or its branch
[03:54:16.394 --> 03:54:19.702]  That is in charge of changing minds by enemy lines.
[03:54:19.702 --> 03:54:22.388]  Acknowledging the term can sound ominous.
[03:54:22.388 --> 03:54:25.114]  What do you think hydrogen bombs dropping on you is?
[03:54:25.114 --> 03:54:25.395]  Ominous?
[03:54:27.363 --> 03:54:30.225]  What do you think a Hellfire missile shooting into your mud hut is?
[03:54:30.225 --> 03:54:31.025]  Ominous?
[03:54:31.025 --> 03:54:34.888]  That's what the Pentagon does, is it dominates and controls.
[03:54:34.888 --> 03:54:38.009]  And the Pentagon admits it now works for Wall Street.
[03:54:38.009 --> 03:54:38.890]  And what is Wall Street?
[03:54:38.890 --> 03:54:51.818]  A bunch of inbred bankers who think that we should all basically die because they have Ponzi-schemed all the wealth of the world into their hands, but they did it through fraud, and so they need to get rid of us so they can enjoy it all.
[03:54:52.765 --> 03:55:02.008]  And they're in control of killers that have bioweapons that can kill even subgroups in the human race.
[03:55:02.008 --> 03:55:06.150]  By subgroups, I mean even down to villages.
[03:55:06.150 --> 03:55:13.552]  Even down to just very delicate genetic variations.
[03:55:13.552 --> 03:55:18.194]  It's like they've got hundreds of species of perch, and most of them are subspecies.
[03:55:18.194 --> 03:55:19.074]  That's what I mean by that.
[03:55:20.148 --> 03:55:20.308]  They've
[03:55:37.811 --> 03:55:42.794]  Lobotomize, you can't even understand me right now, but we've got listeners who do care and are involved.
[03:55:42.794 --> 03:55:50.018]  You know, I said I'd get to this, and I'm going to cover it at the start of the show because I want to be able to go to Coyote and Michael and Pastor.
[03:55:50.018 --> 03:55:54.981]  I mean, just look at all these articles I didn't get to.
[03:55:54.981 --> 03:55:58.383]  I've got a whole bunch of police state articles here.
[03:55:58.383 --> 03:56:00.805]  The First Amendment has been suspended, CNN.
[03:56:00.805 --> 03:56:02.486]  That's their story.
[03:56:02.486 --> 03:56:05.948]  BP, Homeland Security, and cops worked together to deny First Amendment.
[03:56:06.707 --> 03:56:08.468]  In a three state area.
[03:56:08.468 --> 03:56:09.189]  There's no law.
[03:56:09.189 --> 03:56:09.929]  They just do it.
[03:56:09.929 --> 03:56:12.151]  It's called tyranny.
[03:56:12.151 --> 03:56:15.973]  BP cops detain reporter for taking pictures of oil refinery in Houston.
[03:56:15.973 --> 03:56:20.877]  Not allowed for PBS to cover something.
[03:56:20.877 --> 03:56:24.519]  Spy tech that monitors conversations being launched in Europe report.
[03:56:24.519 --> 03:56:25.560]  Raw story.
[03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:28.042]  This is out of a bunch of other mainstream articles.
[03:56:29.765 --> 03:56:35.709]  They used to call them gunshot detectors, but now they admit the NSA is recording everything and running it through a database.
[03:56:35.709 --> 03:56:38.631]  I'll cover this tomorrow, it's so important.
[03:56:38.631 --> 03:56:41.793]  I gotta give each caller one minute now.
[03:56:41.793 --> 03:56:43.835]  Coyote in Colorado, go ahead.
[03:56:43.835 --> 03:56:44.896]  Coyote, go ahead.
[03:56:44.896 --> 03:56:46.997]  Hey Alex, Coyote.
[03:56:46.997 --> 03:56:48.658]  Hey buddy, what's up?
[03:56:48.658 --> 03:56:50.299]  Oh, not a whole heck of a lot.
[03:56:50.299 --> 03:56:56.984]  Anyway, Matt Ryan has an incredible article on InfoWars that people need to go to.
[03:56:57.817 --> 03:57:02.000]  It's called, Why Are Police Abusing the Elderly?
[03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:06.943]  And it's an incredible article, people need to go in and read it and comment.
[03:57:06.943 --> 03:57:19.451]  Also, the Corexit 9500 dispersion that BP is using on the oil spill, it literally disperses
[03:57:20.464 --> 03:57:31.406]  The oil into the water, it becomes soluble in water and makes it impossible for oil booms or for skimmers to remove the oil.
[03:57:31.406 --> 03:57:33.887]  It is the worst thing that they could be doing right now.
[03:57:33.887 --> 03:57:44.049]  Now I've seen a lot of experts in this saying that and it's so toxic and it allows in a lot of the base elements that are poisonous, the heavy metals, the
[03:57:45.802 --> 03:57:52.508]  Other chemicals to then become soluble in water, so that it can be lifted up into the atmosphere.
[03:57:52.508 --> 03:58:08.223]  Exactly, and not only that, once, well, when it evaporates, it becomes part of the ecosystem, and it also becomes part of the water table, especially in estuaries, and then all the birds and the wildlife there pick this stuff up.
[03:58:09.488 --> 03:58:13.113]  And it just, it permeates the entire life cycle.
[03:58:28.072 --> 03:58:28.733]  I'm out of time.
[03:58:28.733 --> 03:58:29.973]  Great job to the crew.
[03:58:29.973 --> 03:58:31.355]  Great job to all the affiliates.
[03:58:31.355 --> 03:58:35.478]  We can save humanity if we face up to how evil the elite are.
[03:58:35.478 --> 03:58:36.438]  Please, folks.
[03:58:36.438 --> 03:58:37.779]  It's so hardcore.
[03:58:37.779 --> 03:58:39.341]  You've got to face all the facts.
