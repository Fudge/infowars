[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:37.720]  it's been 230 40 years since this Republic was established the United States has had its
[00:37.720 --> 00:48.440]  birthday and scores of mainstream newspapers are saying it could be our last so the establishment
[00:48.440 --> 00:54.440]  is now basically trying to demoralize the United States they have denied that they've
[00:54.440 --> 01:00.280]  been dismantling the country for decades when every move they've made has been to do just
[01:00.280 --> 01:05.320]  that and when all of their internal globalist publications admit that that is their goal
[01:05.320 --> 01:15.360]  why now are they all over the news saying the United States is in peril US British
[01:15.360 --> 01:22.320]  Canadian newspapers all basically saying the same thing why has the green light been given
[01:22.320 --> 01:28.280]  to report on this 11 years ago we began to beat the drum about derivatives and how they
[01:28.280 --> 01:33.640]  were counterfeit fraud being sold to government and individuals and how they were designed
[01:33.640 --> 01:40.640]  to implode the economy to be under the loan sharking control of the very so-called banks
[01:40.640 --> 01:48.400]  or the criminal class of fraudsters is really the proper term for them and then I saw in
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.520]  2007 they started admitting it was deadly and going to implode but not saying it was
[01:53.520 --> 01:59.840]  fraud because they were getting ready for the solution to the problem they had created
[01:59.840 --> 02:09.960]  they were getting ready to introduce the solution to the crisis they had engineered here is
[02:09.960 --> 02:20.800]  CNBC today Dow repeats great depression pattern charts show that CNBC Dow repeats depression
[02:20.800 --> 02:32.000]  charts amazing here's another headline with the US trapped in depression this really is
[02:32.000 --> 02:41.520]  starting to feel like 1932 that is the London Telegraph and these type of headlines go on
[02:41.520 --> 02:46.480]  and on and on we're going to read over these articles coming up in the next segment but
[02:46.480 --> 02:59.760]  think about that headline from CNBC Dow repeats great depression pattern the charts show
[02:59.760 --> 03:05.400]  look at this headline out of the Globe and Mail one of the big papers in Canada happy
[03:05.400 --> 03:17.920]  4th of July America needs it the great republic is in a perilous state politically and economically
[03:17.920 --> 03:27.560]  I've got article after article like that in front of me without even looking without even
[03:27.560 --> 03:35.280]  looking this morning this information is all over the map I will guarantee you that if
[03:35.280 --> 03:39.440]  I get my great crew in there to go search these type terms we're seeing we will see
[03:39.440 --> 03:52.000]  a concerted pattern in fact I heard on the radio I was listening to music on XM driving
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.320]  with my wife and so we were listening to some 80s music and the fellow came on yesterday
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.240]  and said happy 4th of July unless you don't want to celebrate it like some people don't
[04:03.240 --> 04:08.000]  want to because of what's going on and where our country is going and I was like excuse
[04:08.000 --> 04:19.840]  me now DJs on 80 stations are making bizarre cryptic comments or perhaps the country is
[04:19.840 --> 04:27.120]  on the verge of total revolution against this off-shore takeover and people are just sick
[04:27.120 --> 04:31.880]  and tired of going along and so they're just spontaneously speaking out could this be like
[04:31.880 --> 04:38.360]  Romanian what happened with Chilcescu I don't know we need to debate this today we don't
[04:38.360 --> 04:41.120]  have any guests lined up because I wanted to be able to open the phones up throughout
[04:41.120 --> 04:44.280]  the broadcast they're not open yet I want to tell you some of the subjects I'd like

[06:12.560 --> 06:17.440]  mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[06:17.440 --> 06:22.840]  they think they own our water children our education our money we have to define who

[08:21.480 --> 08:28.800]  from the UK where he lives and I'm always amazed by the headlines even though I spend
[08:28.800 --> 08:35.520]  many hours every day reading newspapers reading legislation going over government and industry
[08:35.520 --> 08:42.640]  white papers to study what the globalists are saying thinking and doing I am still amazed
[08:42.640 --> 08:51.200]  that this is really happening it is July 5th 2010 the day after our birthday here in the
[08:51.200 --> 08:56.680]  United States for our republic the mainstream media all over the world is saying the United
[08:56.680 --> 09:03.320]  States is in peril of completely collapsing we have to ask ourselves why is the media
[09:03.320 --> 09:12.120]  starting to tell the truth that's an important question isn't it and what are the ramifications
[09:12.120 --> 09:20.800]  of a collapse what does a collapse mean I'll go over that today but just look at these
[09:20.800 --> 09:27.480]  headlines at prison planet dot com TSA to block websites with controversial opinions
[09:27.480 --> 09:31.960]  and the article goes over how info wars dot com prison planet dot com are already being
[09:31.960 --> 09:39.800]  censored by governments around the world here's another one spy tech that monitors conversations
[09:39.800 --> 09:46.480]  being launched in Europe report and this is all over the European newspapers and raw
[09:46.480 --> 09:54.520]  stories reporting on it here but if you go back to my film police state 2000 that I released
[09:54.520 --> 10:05.200]  in 2000 but that we shot in 1999 I have the Austin American statesmen in there and it
[10:05.200 --> 10:19.720]  says oh the Austin police are putting up anti gunshot systems where they can pick up gunshots
[10:19.720 --> 10:25.640]  and then triangulate the location and so I went to a search engine and researched it
[10:25.640 --> 10:29.800]  and found out that it was a federal grant the K. Belly Hutchinson the senator had bragged
[10:29.800 --> 10:33.960]  about getting us the money for it and that had been put in and every major city in the
[10:33.960 --> 10:42.680]  country and that it was not an anti crime device it was not a gunshot detector but that
[10:42.680 --> 10:51.600]  it indeed was a system with shotgun microphones to listen to people at up to 200 yards away
[10:51.600 --> 10:57.520]  and that they were using computer software keyword softwares the same stuff the NSA has
[10:57.520 --> 11:03.280]  used for 30 years with keyword echelon systems to record basically everything and then have
[11:03.280 --> 11:12.000]  computers analyze it and flag it and I'm going to cover this more today but the big issue
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.240]  is that's how illegitimate and how creeping and how criminal this government is all these
[11:19.240 --> 11:23.240]  governments the same system worldwide it's a global corporate government they've taken
[11:23.240 --> 11:27.480]  over almost every nation in the world they've jacked up our taxes paid themselves our tax
[11:27.480 --> 11:32.560]  money used our militaries to back up their takeover of third world nations then the United
[11:32.560 --> 11:40.520]  States England and Europe get our name demonized we then get the blame we collapse a open world
[11:40.520 --> 11:45.280]  government is founded basically run by the third world countries and by run that's in
[11:45.280 --> 11:52.160]  quotes the globalist will just have them vote in a puppet security council system and call
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.800]  for sanctions on the west and the rest of it but the third world armies in the next
[11:56.800 --> 12:01.440]  phase will be used as the muscle to come in here and police of the west it's all been
[12:01.440 --> 12:05.940]  figured out they play every different side against each other and the globalist set
[12:05.940 --> 12:13.440]  off shore basically in this symphony of destruction and manipulation but it was so frustrating
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.680]  to go do the research and read about the company that had gotten the contracts all over the
[12:17.680 --> 12:24.840]  United States and how they bragged that oh not only is it a gunshot triangulator but
[12:24.840 --> 12:35.680]  yes this can be routed into software to pick up violent sounding words agitated tone and
[12:35.680 --> 12:41.560]  then it's a form of pre crime and the police are dispatched but that itself is a cover
[12:41.560 --> 12:45.280]  they're not concerned about crime that they love it because then you beg for more police
[12:45.280 --> 12:53.080]  and more control it's about the NSA listening to you even when you're on the street have
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.480]  you ever read 1984 by Eric Blair pen named George are well he runs off to meet with this
[12:58.480 --> 13:07.520]  woman because it's illegal to have a girlfriend outside of government authorization and they
[13:07.520 --> 13:19.360]  meet in a park and the fact that he is not trying to overthrow the state that's an even
[13:19.360 --> 13:24.120]  bigger crime it's just the fact that he wants to be an individual and maybe have a little
[13:24.120 --> 13:30.840]  privacy there's a camera in the bathroom a camera in the bedroom microphones everywhere
[13:30.840 --> 13:34.360]  and so they go to this park and then they noticed that there's some woods a few hundred
[13:34.360 --> 13:41.400]  yards away so they they go off and they hide in the woods and they make love under some
[13:41.400 --> 13:46.760]  trees and of course it's all videotaped it's all recorded because big brother puts the
[13:46.760 --> 13:54.840]  cameras and microphones by design in the most remote areas and I remember a decade
[13:54.840 --> 13:59.520]  ago as well not just reading about the microphones being put up all over the United States by
[13:59.520 --> 14:06.560]  the Pentagon but that we paid for and then lying to the public whenever they would ask
[14:06.560 --> 14:16.280]  about them and saying oh those are gunshot detectors yes yes yes but I remember reading
[14:16.280 --> 14:22.520]  about billions of dollars two billion dollar homeland security funding eight years ago for
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.600]  New York for cameras and microphones and three billion for Boston but even before that billions
[14:27.600 --> 14:39.920]  of dollars for the most remote areas of Iowa and Colorado and Texas and Utah where they
[14:39.920 --> 14:47.840]  put up cameras and microphones but also little little wire rails that may go dozens of miles
[14:47.840 --> 14:53.120]  one report said and they have these in some of the park land around San Francisco some
[14:53.120 --> 14:59.520]  of the state and federal parks and these little robots buzz back and forth on the wires and
[14:59.520 --> 15:08.520]  then periodically stop and recharge at solar charging systems and then continue on listening
[15:08.520 --> 15:14.640]  to what you're doing in the woods and the spin was we want to catch people dumping things
[15:14.640 --> 15:18.640]  in the national parks and state parks and city parks and of course I went and researched
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.440]  the program more using search engine terms that's all Google is is an NSA search but
[15:23.440 --> 15:29.000]  it allows you to use it at a limited level and using their own technology I went and
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.840]  looked it up and of course it is to see what you're saying when you're in the woods.
[15:36.840 --> 15:46.360]  I was Saturday I watched a Firefox the old Clint Eastwood movie from the late 70s where
[15:46.360 --> 15:54.560]  he's a US spy sent to Russia to steal the high tech stealth aircraft and of course that
[15:54.560 --> 15:58.280]  was all science fiction in that movie of course it turns out the Russians and the US had already
[15:58.280 --> 16:03.280]  developed stealth had it for a decade before that movie was even made see it's all conditioning
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.560]  kind of like they have the new hit movie this weekend salt with CFR member Angelina Jolie
[16:08.560 --> 16:16.800]  to come out six days at the peak cycle right on the fourth of July two days before the fourth
[16:16.800 --> 16:24.240]  of July right when there was a national news story about sexy Russian spies see how everything
[16:24.240 --> 16:28.040]  is conditioned and pre-programmed and they admit now the movies they call it behavior
[16:28.040 --> 16:31.880]  placement for a decade I've called it propaganda placement they now have called it behavior
[16:31.880 --> 16:36.000]  placement and they admit that everything is basically government programming almost every
[16:36.000 --> 16:47.400]  show every national radio program is put out by the big syndicators everything is engineered
[16:47.400 --> 16:54.800]  talking points are handed out and now because the alternative media has grown so fast and
[16:54.800 --> 16:59.800]  is rivaling this and because so many people who are on the radio nationally are rebelling
[16:59.800 --> 17:06.640]  and I've got that from the highest levels and if they all just start telling the truth
[17:06.640 --> 17:10.440]  there's no way they can all be fired or censured and the word is that's already starting that's
[17:10.440 --> 17:14.280]  why you're hearing more and more national hosts admit the government stage is terror
[17:14.280 --> 17:17.400]  you're hearing top republicans come out and say the majority of republicans are against
[17:17.400 --> 17:23.160]  war it's a fraud I even heard beyond the beltway last night admitting maybe we should decriminalize
[17:23.160 --> 17:30.160]  drugs because you know it's corrupting police and corrupting the population more and more
[17:30.160 --> 17:34.480]  people are figuring out that they'd better tell the truth they'd better speak out or
[17:34.480 --> 17:45.760]  it's over you can't just take the middle road here you can't
[17:45.760 --> 17:50.800]  just sit on the sidelines and think that you're going to be unscathed that is the worst position
[17:50.800 --> 17:55.400]  to be in right now but going back to firefox this is how I can't watch movies I can't read
[17:55.400 --> 18:00.560]  the newspaper I can't see somebody playing a video game or I'll be at a coffee shop and
[18:00.560 --> 18:06.200]  hear people regurgitating the propaganda so so everywhere when you're aware of this
[18:06.200 --> 18:11.720]  information you see it so I'm watching firefox and there's that stealth propaganda conditioning
[18:11.720 --> 18:21.760]  many years before in fact almost nine years before they announced stealth technology there
[18:21.760 --> 18:27.680]  they are describing the stealth technology in great detail and now as declassified again
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.120]  they had it a decade before they made the movie in the united states and to some extent
[18:32.120 --> 18:43.800]  Russia and he's going through Russian customs as an American businessman that's his cover
[18:43.800 --> 18:52.720]  Clint Eastwood infiltrating and the movie even admits the cover he's using is a opium
[18:52.720 --> 18:56.880]  trafficker and that the Russians are involved in that with him so they basically let him
[18:56.880 --> 19:03.080]  slip in so there you have the movie admitting that the government ships in the narcotics
[19:03.080 --> 19:07.640]  so it's all about throwing it in your face because they know the subconscious mind is
[19:07.640 --> 19:11.280]  much more powerful than the conscious mind so they're preconditioning you and he goes
[19:11.280 --> 19:15.520]  through a checkpoint and they search his bags and then they ask him questions and he gets
[19:15.520 --> 19:19.920]  mad and says how dare you has never been done to me before and it's shocking in the movie
[19:19.920 --> 19:26.000]  that he's showing his papers and it's shocking that he's having his bags searched and what
[19:26.000 --> 19:35.840]  was that 30 years ago 30 years ago that movie came out and now you look at what a Hollywood
[19:35.840 --> 19:48.120]  rendition of what a total police state looks like and it's America we're going to come
[19:48.120 --> 19:55.040]  back and I'm going to get into some devastating information and then I've got an important
[19:55.040 --> 20:01.760]  question to ask all of you out there stay with us we're live July 5th 2010 so you think
[20:01.760 --> 20:07.440]  the mass of Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe think again benzene a toxic

[20:12.840 --> 20:17.280]  of miles inland whether you live near the Gulf or not benzene and other volatile organic

[22:22.440 --> 22:27.700]  counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an

[24:21.360 --> 24:29.960]  that he's just a fool and he never gives an answer but the fool on the hill alright we're
[24:29.960 --> 24:37.260]  getting close to 80 days into the disaster in the gulf of mexico clearly it is a false
[24:37.260 --> 24:47.560]  flag operation anyway you look at it i'm going to recap that coming up at about 40 after
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.400]  we do have a member of the council on farm relations in the washington post talking about
[24:52.400 --> 25:04.600]  20 million people being forcibly evacuated the official number is over 150 million gallons
[25:04.600 --> 25:10.880]  of oil in the gulf but in the past they've continued to give us lower estimates than
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.800]  and then revise them later so it could be much much higher that's a conservative estimate
[25:15.800 --> 25:21.320]  and the hurricane season as you know is here and a hurricane alex though it just grazed
[25:21.320 --> 25:28.240]  the gulf and went into mexico still is sending now more of the oil towards texas louisiana
[25:28.240 --> 25:34.480]  mississippi florida and the currents are now beginning to bring the largest areas of the
[25:34.480 --> 25:42.840]  slick tens of thousands of square miles of it directly at the florida keys and still
[25:42.840 --> 25:49.600]  obama 70 plus days into this is blocking ships last week they said well we'll start
[25:49.600 --> 25:55.960]  looking at a procedure to down the road allow ships yes we're going to allow it after we
[25:55.960 --> 26:02.440]  bureaucratically sit on it that's a policy the japanese have they'll accept your goods
[26:02.440 --> 26:09.800]  your produce your seafood but then the inspectors don't show up and it rots or you know basically
[26:09.800 --> 26:16.360]  becomes putrid on the dock it's kind of the big mafia union mode of a sabotaging industry
[26:16.360 --> 26:21.640]  and society the united states has been sucked dry the goal was to run up our debts and then
[26:21.640 --> 26:32.960]  bankrupt us and then we will implode into the loan sharks grasp at an even deeper level
[26:32.960 --> 26:37.160]  and so we're getting all these reports of soldiers starting to move families away from
[26:37.160 --> 26:47.880]  the gulf coast i want to open the phones up specifically for soldiers or police or people
[26:47.880 --> 26:54.760]  that are involved in the bureaucratic planning civilian sectors of this specifically them
[26:54.760 --> 27:03.120]  will have open phones after that for everybody specifically for people who are working in
[27:03.120 --> 27:09.520]  the relief effort are who are working in the government for your specific intel on plans
[27:09.520 --> 27:16.160]  for forced evacuations of the gulf area now we saw reports a month and a half ago that
[27:16.160 --> 27:23.760]  40 million were going to be evacuated and that they were being evacuated that i guess
[27:23.760 --> 27:29.840]  came from rumors that there was talk of evacuation now the fact that there are discussing forced
[27:29.840 --> 27:35.280]  evacuations that's now confirmed but you notice that it kind of discredited the original reports
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.920]  because people were saying that the evacuations had begun and that is not the case but clearly
[27:40.920 --> 27:49.840]  a atmosphere of martial law exists in the areas the gulf affected where private bp contractors
[27:49.840 --> 27:56.840]  or anyone with a bp lanyard for that matter can order the police around pbs is reporting
[27:56.840 --> 28:04.120]  on this today it's happened to their reporters front line specifically abc news is reported
[28:04.120 --> 28:09.560]  it cbs that they just come up and say you're not going to film that oil rig from a mile
[28:09.560 --> 28:16.680]  offshore you're not going to film us cleaning up oil and people have even been arrested
[28:16.680 --> 28:22.880]  several miles inland because bp will put out a a pb this is the corporate governance
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.800]  they're they're just training us and drilling us to have foreign troops to have mercenaries
[28:27.800 --> 28:33.480]  to have private contractors to have the clergy quietly on the fema payroll teaching her flock
[28:33.480 --> 28:40.680]  to submit to tyranny this has all been preplanned you notice katrina was a drill a test they
[28:40.680 --> 28:47.160]  use that to see if the troops would confiscate guns as they were ordered to and they did
[28:47.160 --> 28:52.600]  pass the test they did it and so you can see the spp north american union where the corporate
[28:52.600 --> 28:57.440]  chiefs are giving the government officials orders in the meetings you see this in every
[28:57.440 --> 29:09.200]  case and so it is confirmed breaking news military men moving their families snow plows
[29:09.200 --> 29:16.160]  ready to remove abandoned vehicles from highways when evacuation occurs this is from before
[29:16.160 --> 29:23.360]  it's news snow plows ready to remove abandoned vehicles from highways when evacuations occur
[29:23.360 --> 29:27.480]  it's been approximately three weeks since the state trooper secret service pointy greg
[29:27.480 --> 29:39.280]  everton appeared and it just goes on from there now they do have regular evacuation
[29:39.280 --> 29:44.520]  plans for hurricanes that you have evacuation routes and they do have these emergency plans
[29:44.520 --> 29:49.840]  already in place so we have to look at this and study it but also not get overly panicked
[29:49.840 --> 30:00.280]  by where on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network hi folks

[32:03.120 --> 32:07.720]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[32:07.720 --> 32:12.760]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[32:12.760 --> 32:17.840]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[32:17.840 --> 32:22.560]  grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[32:22.560 --> 32:27.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[32:27.840 --> 32:32.960]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[32:32.960 --> 32:37.520]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar powered generator provides
[32:37.520 --> 32:41.640]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar powered
[32:41.640 --> 32:45.760]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more
[32:45.760 --> 32:51.680]  information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember

[33:07.800 --> 33:13.920]  there is no doubt that the media and the government is trying to hide this oil spill to be a lot
[33:13.920 --> 33:20.760]  worse than it is there have been other oil spills that have been larger though the continues
[33:20.760 --> 33:28.040]  to leak it will surpass those in the next few weeks it is estimated the fact that Barack
[33:28.040 --> 33:34.560]  Obama for 70 plus days has blocked foreign governments from coming in with giant oil
[33:34.560 --> 33:39.800]  skimmers like the one we've been talking about the last two weeks the Taiwanese trawler the
[33:39.800 --> 33:51.040]  mega ship that can scoop half a million barrels a day half a million barrels a day out of
[33:51.040 --> 34:01.480]  the Gulf that is more than all of the relief ships in the US fleet combined one ship there
[34:01.480 --> 34:07.000]  are more than 30 of them that have been standing by so I have to deal with what I can prove
[34:07.000 --> 34:20.440]  the government is blocking criminally relief efforts that would have mitigated this to
[34:20.440 --> 34:27.240]  a great extent and we know they're trying to pass a carbon tax in its stead but I'm
[34:27.240 --> 34:32.120]  going to cover that more later I'm going to give you the toll free number to join us
[34:32.120 --> 34:44.480]  if you are police military corporate government individuals with specific first hand knowledge
[34:44.480 --> 34:47.440]  I don't want to play the telephone game you know where you go around the table whisper
[34:47.440 --> 34:51.840]  in somebody's ear by the time it makes it around the table the story is completely changed
[34:51.840 --> 34:58.760]  I would like to specifically hear from you dealing with evacuations now I have the AP
[34:58.760 --> 35:05.200]  I have the Washington Post I have other publications were high powered globalist are on record
[35:05.200 --> 35:12.040]  saying that they believe there's going to be 20 million people evacuated remember the
[35:12.040 --> 35:17.360]  headline week and a half ago two weeks ago oil industry insider and CFR member predicts
[35:17.360 --> 35:24.520]  Gulf evacuation buried in an article in the Gulf of Mexico scenarios and predictions on
[35:24.520 --> 35:35.920]  the Washington Post news site founder and chairman emeritus of Simons and company international
[35:35.920 --> 35:40.240]  said in response to the tropical storm brewing in the Caribbean that's now come and gone
[35:40.240 --> 35:47.160]  Alex Simmons says we're going to have to evacuate the Gulf States can you imagine evacuating
[35:47.160 --> 35:54.120]  20 million people this story is 80 times worse than I thought now is he picking up the feedback
[35:54.120 --> 36:03.000]  loop of the incredible fear mongering going on out there by a lot of sites and organizations
[36:03.000 --> 36:10.960]  and then is this a feedback loop is he regurgitating or is this council on foreign relations member
[36:10.960 --> 36:16.080]  out there pushing and promoting this to create fear and the fact that it's in the Washington
[36:16.080 --> 36:25.760]  Post it's that's pretty much you can't get more establishment in that publication but
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.920]  I don't know I mean we know this crude oil's toxic all crude oil has some toxins in it but
[36:30.920 --> 36:36.880]  this is particularly nasty filled with all these different chemicals benzene the list
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.240]  goes on and on we know that over 150 million gallons conservatively is poured into the
[36:42.240 --> 36:51.400]  Gulf we know it's just out there floating around between 50 and 300 miles offshore it's
[36:51.400 --> 36:57.000]  it's spread all over the Gulf the currents are starting to carry it out into the Atlantic
[36:57.000 --> 37:09.720]  past the Florida keys and the hurricane season is starting and set to drive that oil directly
[37:09.720 --> 37:15.520]  into the shore and I know everybody's talked about this and we've discussed it at nauseam
[37:15.520 --> 37:23.160]  it's just we're getting deeper and deeper and deeper into this and if you add the way
[37:23.160 --> 37:29.600]  the media is hyping it I mean I've been spot checking singing in MSNBC and others and they
[37:29.600 --> 37:36.720]  are behaving as if it is the end of the world last Friday I was watching MSNBC again and
[37:36.720 --> 37:41.920]  it was the same thing I saw the night before they cut to reporters on the beach and there
[37:41.920 --> 37:49.520]  was just a tiny patina kind of like scum you'll get in your bathtub if you don't clean it
[37:49.520 --> 37:57.120]  for a couple weeks there was just a little line maybe a foot wide upon the high water
[37:57.120 --> 38:04.480]  mark of the tide mark where oil had been brought into the Florida panhandle and they were acting
[38:04.480 --> 38:15.720]  like it was the end of the world actually hyperventilating
[38:15.720 --> 38:20.040]  and last week I had one of my mistakes on air I always get names flipped around it wasn't
[38:20.040 --> 38:29.920]  Corbin that that guy died from a from a stingray or whatever his name was I don't remember
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.840]  it's the other one that's still alive who's an American he's got dark hair what's that
[38:34.840 --> 38:40.520]  guy's name who runs around in the bush he's a big environmentalist always demonizing humans
[38:40.520 --> 38:46.120]  at the end of the show it doesn't matter they have one of those nature guys on I don't watch
[38:46.120 --> 38:54.760]  a lot of television and he was literally went for 10 minutes without taking a breath just
[38:54.760 --> 38:59.600]  saying that these beaches are never coming back these estuaries are never coming back
[38:59.600 --> 39:08.840]  these fish you these fisheries and marshes are never coming back ever I mean I thought
[39:08.840 --> 39:13.320]  it was the end of the world if I didn't know better the truth is oil is toxic but it's
[39:13.320 --> 39:17.800]  very biodegradable and there are a lot of different species of bacteria they're naturally
[39:17.800 --> 39:26.040]  occurring that was the Obama administration's excuse for not spraying oil-leading microbes
[39:26.040 --> 39:30.040]  on it as they pointed out well there are hundreds and hundreds in the Gulf different varieties
[39:30.040 --> 39:35.600]  of bacteria and other microbes that eat oil so most of this oil will be eaten up in a
[39:35.600 --> 39:44.240]  few years and that's true but not before it comes in and really hurts the fishing not
[39:44.240 --> 39:47.840]  before it comes in and really causes a problem and if you don't clean up most of it when
[39:47.840 --> 39:53.640]  it's out to sea when it all stacks up and gets blown into shore by hurricanes if you
[39:53.640 --> 40:01.440]  get any fraction of 10 20 30 percent and then they're reporting that conservatively that's
[40:01.440 --> 40:06.300]  probably what's going to come in when some big hurricane said you take 20 30 40 million
[40:06.300 --> 40:12.960]  gallons of oil and you dump that on the Louisiana Mississippi Florida coast and then it goes
[40:12.960 --> 40:19.600]  around through the keys and up the east coast it is going to be hellish and some of that
[40:19.600 --> 40:24.600]  oil is going to go around the world I'll guarantee in 10 years some of that stuff is going to
[40:24.600 --> 40:30.520]  be washing up on the Pacific side of South America and the United States in fact I've
[40:30.520 --> 40:35.000]  seen giant tar balls a few months ago I was down at the Texas beach and there was a tar
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.960]  ball probably the size of my dad took a picture of it we went down there with his fishing
[40:38.960 --> 40:45.720]  with the kids it was probably the size of of a football and it was this big blob but
[40:45.720 --> 40:54.200]  it was hard of tar of old oil and it had mullus growing on it it had barnacles it had little
[40:54.200 --> 41:00.960]  worms it had I mean that thing was a floating island of life and who knows where it came
[41:00.960 --> 41:07.560]  from but it was as hard as a rock and there were all these creatures living on it so
[41:07.560 --> 41:15.640]  I would imagine a decade from now there'll be big tar balls floating up but most of it
[41:15.640 --> 41:22.480]  is going to be eaten but if it blows into shore while it's still off gassing it's going
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.400]  to be a crisis and there probably will be some towns that people got to move back you
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.880]  know 10 15 miles but you know the government they love a good crisis they love an excuse
[41:30.880 --> 41:36.080]  to come in with troops boss people around go into houses rob people's homes remember
[41:36.080 --> 41:42.040]  what police all over Louisiana Mississippi got caught doing on video going in ripping
[41:42.040 --> 41:47.600]  the front doors off pawn shops and jewelry stores and stealing the safes going into Walmart
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.360]  running everybody else out who was stealing so they could steal filling their carts with
[41:52.360 --> 41:58.000]  television sets I mean let's face it America on average is very decadent and very immoral
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.840]  and police are made up of decadent immoral people not all of them but they're made up
[42:02.840 --> 42:07.960]  of a sampling of what the United States has turned into and you've got great officers
[42:07.960 --> 42:12.840]  out there but more and more they protect the goons they promote the thugs the lowest common
[42:12.840 --> 42:18.480]  denominator that'll follow orders and then enjoy meeting out oppression because that's
[42:18.480 --> 42:27.000]  what the system wants and so when that oil I mean if they're acting like it's the end
[42:27.000 --> 42:37.120]  of the world on CNN MSNBC and Fox to some extent and CNBC if they're breathless talking
[42:37.120 --> 42:44.920]  about the tiny fraction of oil that's already hit and it is a problem if they've already
[42:44.920 --> 42:49.680]  10 miles inland in Louisiana Mississippi and other areas declared it a federal disaster
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.400]  area and are telling people they can't fish I mean I see it in the news every day where
[42:54.400 --> 43:03.360]  families 10 miles in our bass fishing on vacation in completely beautiful blue lakes
[43:03.360 --> 43:10.080]  that are connected to the ocean waterways and the BP people the local police the game
[43:10.080 --> 43:15.720]  wardens the Coast Guard comes up and says you can't fish here get off this lake any
[43:15.720 --> 43:22.080]  excuse to boss people around but then 10 miles away where the oil is coming in we're now
[43:22.080 --> 43:32.240]  almost 80 days what is it day 76 77 they are not letting people clean up the oil the religion
[43:32.240 --> 43:41.920]  of government is setting up a precedent to expand their jurisdiction criminally illegally
[43:41.920 --> 43:48.200]  illegitimately and so they expand their jurisdiction in New Orleans they went in didn't bring in
[43:48.200 --> 43:51.520]  food and water block people from getting it wouldn't let people exit the city wouldn't
[43:51.520 --> 43:56.240]  let them walk out over the highways ordered police to shoot and kill families trying to
[43:56.240 --> 44:02.200]  come out we told you at the time Charles in Louisiana he's been calling in for 13 years
[44:02.200 --> 44:06.600]  a good source of info sent us a lot of good info over the years he called in and said
[44:06.600 --> 44:12.440]  well today Mr. Jones they shot some people peaceful families trying to get out trying
[44:12.440 --> 44:18.520]  to walk over the highway system which is high and dry and they shot him and a year later
[44:18.520 --> 44:24.640]  it came out there'd been a cover-up and it had happened and three years after that some
[44:24.640 --> 44:29.320]  of the police officers that followed the orders and they're still guilty but not as guilty
[44:29.320 --> 44:33.880]  as those that gave the orders to them to shoot those people and drive back a crowd of men
[44:33.880 --> 44:40.640]  women and children trying to get out you're not gonna get out they've they've set the
[44:40.640 --> 44:46.720]  precedent that they can either tell you to get out when you don't need to leave or they
[44:46.720 --> 44:57.320]  can lock you down in a city and make you stay there 76 days in 76 days in and where are the
[44:57.320 --> 45:03.920]  Norwegian and the Dutch and the Taiwanese and the Japanese and the German and the Brazilian
[45:03.920 --> 45:12.280]  mega ships that can come in and suck up tens of thousands of barrels a day individually
[45:12.280 --> 45:22.440]  some of the ships a quarter million barrels 300,000 400,000 barrels and one ship 500,000
[45:22.440 --> 45:31.520]  barrels a day and I just keep beating that drum because this is a crisis they're not
[45:31.520 --> 45:37.120]  gonna let go to waste they need this ecological disaster to hammer through their takeover
[45:37.120 --> 45:43.600]  of all western industry when you hear green industry that means the government says what
[45:43.600 --> 45:47.600]  type of industry you can have that means they say you've got to buy this type of generator
[45:47.600 --> 45:52.680]  or this type of electrical transmission system or you can't have that type of factory or
[45:52.680 --> 45:57.640]  you can't have this type of house or you can't have that type of business or you can't have
[45:57.640 --> 46:03.800]  a pond on your property this is total feudalism and serfdom and they're announcing it in Europe
[46:03.800 --> 46:10.000]  can't have a space seater outside can't have a fireplace you've got to have a zero carbon
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.760]  footprint home families aren't allowed to live in a home by themselves that's too wasteful
[46:15.760 --> 46:24.040]  you must all live in dormitories I've got stacks of mainstream news here today in front
[46:24.040 --> 46:30.600]  of me where they now admit in England London telegraph they're all reporting on it that
[46:30.600 --> 46:36.080]  the government does indeed have quotas of absolutely innocent families and their newborn
[46:36.080 --> 46:41.600]  babies before the babies are born they're even looking for hair color eye color you
[46:41.600 --> 46:46.520]  name it for rich families that are going to adopt them of course we are harvested by
[46:46.520 --> 46:52.800]  government and I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen I know you know this and in fact
[46:52.800 --> 46:59.440]  I said I was going to get to this and I am now then we're going to come back and take
[46:59.440 --> 47:09.440]  phone calls from people that have specific intel on preparations for evacuation in the
[47:09.440 --> 47:20.000]  Gulf states specific information doesn't be specific information that it's that it's going
[47:20.000 --> 47:26.480]  to happen or that you've told it's going to be something that's taking place in the future
[47:26.480 --> 47:33.000]  it just needs to be whether you've been told that it's a possibility or if you have been
[47:33.000 --> 47:50.320]  told they're preparing for it what those preparations are 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 is the toll free
[47:50.320 --> 48:08.240]  number to join us again 800-259-9231 pull out tell you two days being off and coming back
[48:08.240 --> 48:15.120]  in here and looking at all this news this morning and reading over this my head is spinning
[48:15.120 --> 48:29.040]  what about yours my head is spinning right now and I understand why people are living
[48:29.040 --> 48:35.120]  in denial out there I know why people don't want to believe this is really happening that
[48:35.120 --> 48:41.680]  tyranny comes in incrementally it's happened slowly it's creeping death creeping death
[48:41.680 --> 48:57.960]  of our society but the prognosis any way you slice it runs from bad to worse
[48:57.960 --> 49:05.920]  and I don't know if they're going to cap the oil well anytime soon I don't know how devastating
[49:05.920 --> 49:12.440]  it's going to be when the majority of that oil gets blown in by those hurricanes I don't
[49:12.440 --> 49:16.120]  know if they're going to launch an attack on Iran even though the mainstream media says
[49:16.120 --> 49:22.440]  they're gearing up to do it and it's pretty much a foregone conclusion but I'll tell you
[49:22.440 --> 49:28.440]  what I do know I know that we're all becoming acclimated even if you're against all this
[49:28.440 --> 49:35.960]  evil at some level we're all becoming comfortable with it we're becoming accustomed to it we're
[49:35.960 --> 49:43.000]  becoming accepting of it and that's why we really can't approach this emotionally it's
[49:43.000 --> 49:49.760]  good to get emotional and angry to get moving but you have to follow up with focused cold
[49:49.760 --> 49:57.400]  determination you have to make it a goal to wake up as many people as you can and to defend
[49:57.400 --> 50:03.800]  this republic and to restore this republic whatever it takes because I realize reading
[50:03.800 --> 50:09.400]  this news this morning that I don't even want to cover it believe me I want to just walk
[50:09.400 --> 50:14.520]  away and go hide out in the farmhouse somewhere and just make the commitment that anybody
[50:14.520 --> 50:21.840]  comes here and tries to violate my rights they're going to have a problem but you know
[50:21.840 --> 50:29.720]  what that is a loser mentality you cannot run and hide from this you've got to meet
[50:29.720 --> 50:35.320]  it head on it's the only way because I know the government shipping and the narcotics
[50:35.320 --> 50:41.040]  I know the government is totally criminal I know they've engineered a depression and
[50:41.040 --> 50:46.240]  that we're in a depression and now the mainstream media is admitting we're in a depression I
[50:46.240 --> 50:54.160]  know that the establishment is adding sterilants and toxins and carcinogens by designing to
[50:54.160 --> 50:59.520]  our water and food and I know that my children deserve to not drink that I'm going to stop
[50:59.520 --> 51:07.520]  these people this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells are on a staggering
[51:07.520 --> 51:12.080]  pace gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate vicious criminals

[56:13.680 --> 56:19.920]  by design the very same central banks have done this in smaller third world nations by smaller
[56:19.920 --> 56:27.120]  smaller gdp and so we know they've they've done it over and over and over again they're just going

[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.760]  happening with the economy and what i believe is going to happen next and what i think we can do
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.880]  to counter these criminals because they are now just like in 2007 they started getting everybody
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.800]  ready for the controlled housing implosion as the cover for the engineer depression and now
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.760]  they're telling you we're in a depression and get ready for total collapse which means they're
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:34.720]  strongly considering pulling the plug we're already circling the toilet bowl slowly and but
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:43.600]  they're starting to accelerate that and so and of course we would expect with a new war and with
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:49.440]  a full blown depression an economic collapse they would shut down the web so they're getting all the
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:55.600]  couch potatoes ready for that telling them how essential it is every day uh so things don't
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.920]  look good i'm i'm going to be honest with you we've been building towards this point for the last
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.920]  15 years that i've been on air trying to warn you about the bankers and what they've done to
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.680]  every other country they control and uh here we are we're in a good position to fight them better
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:22.800]  than we would have been because we have been here speaking out and because we understood the globalist
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:33.200]  game plan but we're still in very very dire straits and when i say we're in a better position
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.120]  we're ready for the punch that's getting thrown in our stomach it doesn't mean it's going to feel
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.840]  good at least some of us are ready all right i'm going to go to break and come back uh so bob
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.560]  doesn't get cut short into bob and michigan and others but if you've gotten the intel or you know
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.520]  if your husband's out on an oil rig and he's been told some information you want to tell us or
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.040]  you're a police officer in the gulf and i'm sure you've asked what are we going to do when the
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.600]  world comes to shore what have you been told or are they keeping that information close to their
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:09.760]  vest it is compartmentalized you know the mere fact that they're not preparing for an evacuation or at
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:15.360]  least telling lower level personnel that tells you as much as not being told what they're planning
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.240]  because they should be planning uh for different contingencies because you get
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.760]  all of that oil coming to shore and as the gulf heats up in august and september that's when it
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.880]  gets its hottest because it takes all the first few months of summer to really get it hot and then
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.840]  by august and september it's like bathtub water then all that methane all that natural gas all
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:43.760]  that oil plume that's underwater because most of it's underwater uh it's going to off gas even worse
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:50.160]  and some experts are talking about you know 100 miles inland they're being toxic clouds because
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:56.640]  oil doesn't precipitate and turn into water vapor but all those other chemicals that's leaching out
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:02.640]  of it they do we'll talk about it straight ahead listen up folks this is important alex jones here

[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.960]  what the problems are because bp the genesis communications radio network
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:09.040]  proudly presents dispersants however we know that they're the same types of illnesses that
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:16.880]  people reported in alaska now the average lifespan of a person who did clean up on the
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:23.920]  exxon valdez is 51 years old almost all those people who did work on the exxon valdez are now
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:31.520]  dead and bp still here once again is big oil not giving the information to the doctors and
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:38.560]  health care officials county nurse was not given permission to go on to the bp property when she
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:45.920]  finally did that on the the people who work at bp who are coming to see her were only allowed to
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:53.680]  get band-aids and aspirin from her and they were told that they only could go to the to the bp
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.800]  doctors if they wanted to get treated president obama touched on on the health issues in particular
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:08.560]  are in the gulf today and i want to play this listen so far we have seen that on shore we are
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:17.920]  not seeing huge elevations in toxins in the air or in the water but that may not be the case
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:24.480]  out where people are actually doing the work and we've got to make sure that we are providing
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:34.000]  all the protections that are necessary okay we're going to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.920]  if you've got any specific intel but this has been going on for weeks they are saying that
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.240]  the dispersant is not bad for you though it admittedly has the skull and crossbones on the
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:52.480]  container they have put millions and millions and millions of gallons of the dispersant into the
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:10:00.000]  gulf it is much worse this is one of the cases where the disease is more preferable than the cure
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.640]  where the cure is worse than the disease and that's obama a paid corporate liar who will tell you
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:12.080]  that there's no health problems people have died mainline medical doctors who've seen the workers
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:19.680]  are saying that their lungs are completely fried that that that they're dead men walking the average
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:25.040]  of life expectancy from the exon Valdez where they use these same dispersants is 51 years
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:33.600]  that's 20 plus years less than the average life expectancy in fact roughly 25 years less
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:43.120]  so there you have it and BP has its own little special doctors and now the oil is coming in
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:51.360]  towards the shore and you better believe that just like with the 9-11 victims and the emergency
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:58.000]  workers they were not given treatment and it was covered up for close to a decade and i've seen
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  new york post articles calling the police and firemen ambulance chasers though they're dying or dead
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:10.800]  all these universities have done CAT scans just countless universities their doctors have come
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:17.520]  out medical centers and said we we CAT scan their lungs they're full of asbestos and mercury and
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:23.920]  pulverized dust and concrete and glass and they're dying and i've been there with these
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:31.200]  military men and women firemen and police and they will be walking around 35 45 year old men
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.720]  and women with tanks of oxygen and they will in the green room with you when i've been at 9-11
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:41.760]  events in new york they will say excuse me and and you'll go around the corner and they're coughing
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.320]  blood up in a handkerchief i've been there when they're too sick to even speak and you know what
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.520]  they say about them they're scum they're liars they're not sick and so when you go down there and
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:56.000]  clean up that oil with all that dispersant then you die like a roach that's been sprayed with
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  raid they'll tell you go crawl in a hole and die just like our troops that breathed all that chemical
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.920]  chemical weapons residue when the u.s blew up this the weapon systems they'd sold saddam they
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.760]  were getting rid of the evidence at camisee and other bunkers when people came back and their
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.800]  brain stem shriveled up and they died they did autopsies and would even find that they died of
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:22.080]  nerve agents but the government said we're not giving a red cent to your family because you
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.800]  aren't just cheap you're seen as trash to them all right let's go to bob and michigan bob thanks
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.520]  for holding tell us the info you've got uh on uh plans for evacuations if any in the gulf
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.800]  okay well it's not evacuation plans but i work for a uh uh manufacturing company up here in
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:47.840]  walker michigan and we have a contract with bp to build oil booms and about about five days ago
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.680]  bp basically threatened to quit participating in their side of the contract by buying our oil booms
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:59.040]  if we didn't make the product like far or less effective i have my foreman on a tape recorder
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:04.080]  here saying that basically essentially yes they wanted us to like make sure that the booms were
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.880]  essentially worthless before the anchor was attached to a big uh the chain link that runs all
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.200]  the way through the side of the boom and how they wanted it redesigned is where they put a little
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.880]  metal eyelet inside of the nylon fabric and then run a quarter inch cable through it so basically
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:24.400]  the anchor will like rip right through the uh material and i've got that on uh on audio right
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.000]  here from my foreman um that uh company was in the newspaper about three days ago they did a
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.200]  big story about how like you know bp is putting americans to work and americans are working to
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.920]  you know solve this right now and all this stuff the name of the company is prestige parts and
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.320]  walker michigan um i'm probably going to try and get at least three or four of the other guys that
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.760]  work that are calling and talk to you and my girlfriend's right here she's quality control
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:54.640]  she knows it but she won't get on the phone um yeah that's that's what i got incredible information
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.680]  well this fits in with obama blocking all of the skimmerships this fits in with uh him dumping his
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:08.320]  stock the week before that he had in bp along with the bp ceo goldman sacks dumping it just record
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:14.320]  levels of stock being dumped but but to be specific i'm not very familiar with these booms
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.040]  uh but i've seen it on the news and they've already talked about how a lot of them are
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.440]  ineffective but what you're saying is is that it's going to be anchored to something that when
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:29.440]  waves hit it it's just going to basically rip the cable out of the nylon is that what you're saying
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:36.640]  that's my uh my foreman did a psi test on it because he like tested like the old version
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.640]  versus the new version of how they want it and like it i mean i've got him on tape like right
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.800]  here you know saying that it's like far less effective that basically they wanted ineffectual
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.440]  oil booms to continue to even like keep participating in the contract for a year to buy oil booms from
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:15:00.880]  us now here's the 64 million dollar question are these oil booms cheaper yes are they jealous
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.880]  my girlfriend says yes she's quality control and are on for supervisor
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:12.560]  here and so they are somewhat cheaper well that could be the motive but see i mean that's classic
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:18.560]  where they just want people to see booms it doesn't matter if they basically fall apart like a cheap
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.760]  t-shirt i mean everybody's been to a party or to an event where they hand out free t-shirts but
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.360]  they're so cheap the first time you wear it it starts tearing out the seams because it's so thin
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:35.040]  and the stitching falls out i mean i've i've seen t-shirts that fall apart when you first put them
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:44.160]  on so that's basically what this sounds like but would the motive in that be it being inexpensive
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.400]  or would the because they're charged with cleaning it up so you would think that they want to clean
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:54.960]  it up quick because if they don't work the mitigation is going to be much more expensive
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:00.560]  or is it because they're in bed with obama as being the head globalist pushing the carbon tax bp
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.440]  literally created it with ken lay of enron that's on record uh i mean what do you think
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.960]  i think that you know it's totally apart you know they want to try and get that global carbon tax
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:16.400]  in and also um i think that you know they buy oil booms a lot and i'm sure that they test their
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:20.720]  products to see like which are the most resilient and effective for the job so i'm pretty sure they
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.000]  would know you know i mean it's their job to know these things they you know walk around an
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.560]  armani suit so i would have been you know i mean they know you know so it has to be in for them
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.200]  you know i mean what's the cost of losing all that oil out there you know i mean and like i'm
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:41.040]  just saying you know well the booms don't catch it if the booms don't catch it so that they can
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:46.160]  suck the oil up so the ships can come by and suck the oil up it's going to be much more expensive
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.640]  for them to clean up what ends up hitting the shore or going into the rivers and estuaries
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:58.480]  unless that's what they want and on every front they will aggressively obama and bp do whatever it
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:02.720]  takes to make sure it's as bad as it can be i mean what are your what are your co-workers
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.480]  things going on well and all of them say that basically they don't they they want booms that
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.400]  won't even work they think it's any of the like at least three or four of the people i've talked to
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:20.480]  think it's a total joke including the foreman and this outfit yeah good sorry now is just you're
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.520]  saying this outfit that you work for is one of the biggest suppliers of booms i don't know if
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:29.280]  they're one of the biggest suppliers suppliers of booms but they have a contract with bp
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.920]  to make all of them but and i mean like you were saying before though about like you know
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.840]  how it benefits them i mean it's priceless for them to be able to try and like read the
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.480]  invigorate the environmental movement with this so you know i mean and i don't i mean you like
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.600]  you say you know there's tons of oil out there that they've got all the land they all do they
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:53.200]  don't build refineries you know you know it's just all it's all straight and they know how
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:18:00.080]  people's brains work they know that three months six months a year into this people say just do

[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:13.600]  then oh then they'll find the solution uh to fixing the problem magically this fits their
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:21.440]  mo to a t and it also is a nice political diversion while they devalue the dollar and
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:27.680]  and get ready to launch potentially what could trigger world war three uh with iran anything
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:34.960]  else bob um just i i mean you always talk about wanting people to bring up bring up solutions
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.880]  and stuff like that and you know i think that debba medina even though she kind of like you
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.120]  know turned around during her campaign like she really raised the basis for like economic
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.040]  diffusion and decentralization in the states you know and a lot of states like that's what we
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.640]  really i think have to do is kind of like reimagine the madisonian division itself
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:59.840]  and try to equitably distribute that within you know throughout it yeah bob bob stay in contact
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.520]  whether it's your phone's really breaking up but i appreciate you giving us that information we'll
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:09.840]  we'll try to look into that and of course others can do that as well but we know
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:16.640]  they're blocking the states and that's why it is important uh to get good governors in place
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:25.200]  and it would have been nice to debba medina would have won uh so that if the oil spill is to hit
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.960]  texas it hasn't yet thank god that she could go down there and somehow confront the feds because
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:37.040]  there's no way the feds can just brazenly say that they have this jurisdiction and that no one can
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:45.280]  stop the oil in plain view of everyone if somebody with authority just stands up to them in a media

[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.000]  we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody british in a town in
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.440]  the new olines we fired our guns and the british kept becoming there was what has the united states
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:34.880]  been turned into a bunch of domesticated soft people looking for a free lunch
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:45.360]  but we haven't gotten a free lunch have we know the incredible wealth built up by our
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:54.640]  forebears has been stolen and the controllers of this nation have run up a 600 that's conservative
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.280]  600 trillion dollar debt when you hear about a national debt every year
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:08.560]  and you hear about how it's 14 trillion dollars and all of this that is nothing when you actually
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:15.040]  look at what these bankers have created and how they've tied it to us the taxpayers they say
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:24.080]  we are liable for their derivatives that they have created you see that's what gives their
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:31.280]  worthless derivatives value they first sell their derivatives out into the market
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:38.160]  people buy them who've been defrauded and the globalists consolidate their power further
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:46.160]  then when their toxic assets that they've sold begins to destroy all the major economies and
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:53.120]  savings of the planet the bankers come in as the saviors saying we've got a solution a bank of the
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:26:00.160]  world we remonetize the globe we devalue all the world's currencies but this new currency it has
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:09.360]  value sdr special drawing rights which just means the bankers can make up in a computer
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.760]  infinity ones and zeros now they already had that power through doubling
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.520]  because they can double money and then double it again and then double it again and double it
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.320]  again through fractional reserve banking but with the end of Glass-Steagall 11 years ago
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:35.280]  they have transcended even that and it's so elementary it's so simple they are con artists
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.400]  they are fraudsters i say this every day because if this message doesn't get out
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:47.360]  we have no future we must expose the fact that bernie made off was the founder of the nasdaq
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:56.640]  we must expose that he helps set up many of the systems that we are now being destroyed by financially
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.600]  and the power to taxes the power to destroy it is destroying our jobs our industry everything
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:09.200]  and then you look at ken lay and in ron and bp and all of these people these are the very
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:14.640]  individuals that created the new derivative of the carbon tax and they've been pushing this and
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:22.080]  promoting this for 15 years as the main funding mechanism for their new private global government
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:31.040]  this criminal ruling class this criminal class who has total contempt for us because we've let
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:38.560]  them bamboozle us to this level it is a sick joke they laugh at us so here's what i'm going to do
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:43.680]  i'm going to open the phones up completely not just for whistleblowers but for everybody
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:52.320]  to specifically give me your ideas of how you think we can get ourselves out of this mess
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:58.000]  and what course of action concisely you think we as individuals can take
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:05.440]  but also which direction we want to force this out of control government to go in and how do we
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:14.080]  force them to do that but i'll say this the number one message and the number one mission that i've
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:20.800]  got is simply telling the people who the bad guys are the general public is starting to get angry
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:26.320]  starting to get focused starting to awaken but they still don't understand who their enemy is
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:32.000]  completely and they don't know the depth of corruption and the depth of ruthlessness you
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:40.160]  must first know your enemy and then you've got to have the will to face them down and you've
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.680]  got to have the will to make sacrifices and if you're ashamed to knock on your neighbor's door
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:52.720]  or invite him over for coffee and a piece of pie if you're ashamed to talk to your neighbor or if
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:56.880]  you're foolish enough to not understand that just having that neighbor over for coffee and a piece of
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:03.680]  pie to talk about the state of the world you begin to shift your attention their attention
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:10.000]  on the issues that are actually important see that's part of the big globalist mind trick is
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.120]  they say oh you don't talk about taxes you don't talk about politics you don't talk about religion
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.720]  you know oh it's the weekend or oh i'm going bowling with with you know the boys or i'm going out with
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:28.080]  my girlfriends to eat dinner uh men and women out there think that it's their private time
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:33.360]  their precious time and they don't want to hear about anything negative uh that's see that's
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:41.520]  individual selfishness we're going to lose everything because the general public doesn't
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:47.040]  know how the world works and doesn't understand how dark the streets are and doesn't want to be
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:53.600]  uncomfortable well you're going to be uncomfortable because we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:26.800]  yeah no problem i was at the uh taste of chicago yesterday and noticed a huge uh police state
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:33.760]  uh situation there uh there were uh camouflage looking officers all over the place that was
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:40.640]  there was a department of homeland security federal protective police service of roaming
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:45.040]  through downtown all over state street which is one of the one of the busiest streets and
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:50.000]  downtown a month ago well we got video of over me posting it this week the full report to prison
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:57.840]  planet dot tv uh on top of it there is the uh foreign troops from eastern europe training
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:03.120]  to take on domestic groups we have it on video we were there i sent my crew up there all part of
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:09.200]  the acclamation but notice the bigger the police state the less secure you are total gun ban in
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:15.760]  chicago in fact guys i i am due this on friday i don't know if you have it uh but i forget the
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:20.000]  exact headline i was telling my crew because i wanted to read it on air it was something like uh
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:27.840]  chicago uh you know revises gun ban and they were saying ha ha ha it'll still be almost
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:33.680]  impossible to get a gun and everyone who has been convicted of a gun crime has to come register and
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:39.600]  you have to take five hours of training and we have to authorize you and it's still up to our
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:45.120]  discretion and so this is the new model the supreme court says you can have a gun but you
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:50.560]  can jump through a hundred hoops to get it so most people will be barred and just to see that mob boss
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:57.520]  daily bragging about how he's going to still disarm people there he is in a city that is more
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.080]  dangerous than many areas of mexico i mean there's only one city in the united states
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.760]  that has collapsed as bad as mexico into crime and that's chicago and no one denies that i was
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:13.120]  listening to chicago based radio last night for about an hour beyond the beltway uh as i was
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:18.480]  sitting there fishing and they were admitting the host was admitting it is becoming just a hell
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:24.720]  hole of crime uh but uh please continue julia yeah the police state's pretty disgusting here
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:29.360]  there's uh actually i was with a member of we are change chicago filming out of police state stuff
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:34.400]  and there was the in the american flag right near congress uh congress boulevard downtown
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:40.400]  underneath the american flag was uh two great cc tv camera so that's great for our protection big
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:46.160]  brother watching us but my question to you is is about bill gates and bill deberg you're talking
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:51.600]  about how uh with jim talker and others how they gave the green light pretty much for an invasion
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.400]  of iran what i'm concerned about with bill gates and uh i'm sure you're going to talk about this
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:02.000]  in your new fall the republic eugenics film is about now you know that weather modification
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:10.640]  and how he and melinda gates are big on eugenics and vaccinations have you got any intel from your
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:17.440]  sources uh we know bill deberg well about how bill gates will be using any like weather modifications
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:23.840]  i think jail salente talked about the new dust bowl will be the bp oil spill and now who you think
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:27.520]  they're going to talk about these record temperatures going on in the northeast and all around the
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:33.760]  country that this is global warming coming back and we need to have a cap and trade uh tax us for
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:41.200]  breathing um situations i appreciate your call that's a wide range of important questions and we
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:46.080]  i'm sure you could talk for an hour on each one and so could i uh but bill and melinda gates
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:56.880]  foundation it was uh the rockefeller founder now i knew that
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:06.480]  over a hundred years ago the banking families propagandized through the media
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:15.920]  and said oh uh yes it's trust busting we've got all these big monopolies and so you've punished
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:23.120]  us uh well our companies are now going to be broken up but what happened was the holdings
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:28.720]  that these elite families had basically went tax exempt and went into foundations
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:37.840]  and i'd always known that the rockefeller family basically created the modern environmental
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:47.040]  movement i'd always known that they basically promoted philanthropic endeavors as a way to hide
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.480]  their money and use the money for social control and to secure their monopoly but i was up here
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:58.160]  friday and rob jegerson was saying watch this documentary i saw it on pbs about the rockefellers
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:03.680]  and and they're lo and behold he played me the clip i didn't know the rockefellers founded the term
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:10.480]  philanthropy oh i'm a philanthropist and that and that the rockefellers didn't like people saying
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.320]  hey give your money to charity hey you're so rich worth billions of millions of dollars the turn of
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:25.440]  the 20th century over a hundred years ago and so they invented you learn something every day
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.880]  they invented philanthropy well what do you see bill and melinda gates doing with their hundred
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:36.560]  billion what do you see warren buffett with his 80 billion what do you see them doing they put it
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:48.400]  in a tax-free foundation and then only the interest on that money goes to their supposed
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:42:00.480]  social endeavor and then they keep all their assets tax-free it is a huge unfair
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:05.120]  trade advantage business advantage because everybody else is having to pay taxes and that's
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:11.760]  why you're reading the memoirs of the asters and others even recently they'll brag what taxes that's
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:19.520]  that's for little people see you pay taxes they don't and yes most of what bill and melinda gates
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:27.840]  spend their money on is eugenics is population reduction and the second biggest area that
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:33.600]  i've noticed bill and melinda gates are now involved in is weather modification and i'm sure
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:38.720]  most of you've seen that it's been all over the news oh isn't bill gates nice he's invested
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:45.120]  billions of dollars in stopping hurricanes he's invested billions of dollars in weather control
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:50.000]  he has all these patents and oh he wants a new government agency to be created to fund this
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:57.920]  yeah to fund him he'll control the weather bureau the bill and melinda gates weather control
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:02.880]  you know this sunny day brought to you by bill and melinda gates foundation this is what our
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:08.960]  grandkids are going to be listening to it turns out that in the early 60s the u.s government
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:15.840]  was controlling speeding them up making them weaker making them stronger killing them
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:21.840]  them directing them steering them hurricanes and in 1967 the stanford research institute
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:32.960]  and of course the naval war laboratory headed up at that time by ben livingston did certify
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:39.280]  that they had complete control over the weather and so yes they are manipulating the weather
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:44.480]  now what's manipulated and what isn't once they start changing the weather in one spot
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:50.640]  that changes the weather forever though probably in small ways who knows what chain reactions they
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:54.480]  could be creating you know that's really the problem at the end of the day is the globalists
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:59.440]  are all about data they're all about controlling information they're all about understanding
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:06.400]  systems but to do that they engage in massive test massive experiments and we are all taking
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:13.840]  part in genetic engineering experiments in toxic experiments being poisoned in weather control
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:20.640]  experiments and bill and melinda gates are developing viruses that go in and reprogram
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.200]  your brain and i've been warning you about that for a decade at least but now it's mainstream news
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.720]  and you just wake up and you're not who you were before and that's the type of enemy we face and
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:34.800]  they've already got all this stuff they admit they do that's why they're so arrogant that's why
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:42.000]  they don't care ladies and gentlemen and you try to talk to some steroid head cop about this
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.840]  information they're just going to laugh ladies and gentlemen if it wasn't on american idol they're
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:50.080]  not going to listen you try to talk to your dumb neighbor they're not going to listen you try to
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:57.600]  talk to the average american even though they don't like being screwed by the government and they
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:03.360]  know things are getting worse and worse they still just don't realize how serious it is and i and i
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:09.840]  love america and i love the good people that are in this country i mean it's a mix people say well
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:15.920]  the ugly americans you know the rude americans overseas when they see how we behave how we're
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:24.960]  wealthy and take it for granted how we're into uh pettiness and and and style and i mean that's
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:31.440]  really looked down upon by by classy people we are creatures of the corporate board we're creatures
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:39.760]  of whatever the system is selling us we dress like clowns we're a joke and it's easy for
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:46.720]  people that have never had it good to see that um and i'm saying i'm a joke i mean i i'm not up here
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:52.080]  judging anybody we are the children of decadent people who are the children of decadent people
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:56.560]  who are the children of decadent people now sure you take some money on average born a hundred
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:03.680]  years ago they were a lot more polite a lot harder working a lot more honorable statistically
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:13.120]  historically i'm not saying you are a bad person individually i'm just saying on average
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:17.440]  but it's more than just the fact that we're decadent we are
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:28.880]  we're poisoned we're chemically blunted we're in a big giant science experiment
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:34.240]  with a bunch of control freaks that think they're god doing really bad things to everybody and it's
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:41.840]  all real i mean cnn admits they put silicon and chicken mcnuggets a petrochemical that's admittedly
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:49.840]  toxic everything gets tested on us that's illegal everywhere in the world but here
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:58.480]  the gmo crops were fed are illegal everywhere in the world but here we are a joke okay now i'll
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:06.640]  admit i'm a joke i don't want to be a joke i want to i'm gonna go to gill hung up i'm gonna go to
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.160]  brian eric laura you know there's no gill didn't hang up he's just at the end of the line there
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:14.720]  and see that caller calls in and he brings up such heavy subjects
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:25.520]  i just realized my children don't have much future and that's a really scary thing to face up to
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:34.480]  but i know this i can't stop living i can't stop my will to live i can't stop my life force
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:41.520]  and the fact that my instincts and my spirit everything i am is driving me forward to explore
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:51.920]  to trailblaze to continue to live just living is a victory for our ancestors thousands of years ago
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:58.800]  just surviving was victory just having children and enough of the children surviving to have children
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.280]  that was winning and that's still winning and the globalists boil everything down to that
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.960]  they understand that's winning that's why they've got a plan through banking fraud to bankrupt
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:12.640]  almost everyone so that you're now under their control and so your government's under their
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:18.800]  control so they can then kill you because when you don't exist anymore and your children don't
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:24.880]  exist anymore they have full spectrum dominance and they debate whether they're going to keep
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.240]  less than a million people or whether they should have 500 million and they put out white papers
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:36.160]  and have debates that we've covered and linked to they have hundreds and hundreds of public debates
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.640]  and they laugh at you in the debates and know you're not even interested and they say because
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:48.160]  you're not interested you deserve to die i mean i don't like a bunch of control freaks messing
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:51.600]  with my water and my food and talking about how i don't deserve to live and
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:01.680]  how they plan to kill me and how they're slowly killing all of us to where we die of degenerative
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:07.840]  diseases most of us are now sterile or almost sterile and i sit around recognizing it and
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.840]  i'm here on the radio and i'm talking about it and we have radio breaks and i have guessed on and i've
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.480]  got to kind of be part of the system at a certain level you know part of the structure to be able
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:25.360]  to promote and to be able to have advertisers i mean you know this this system is so corrupt
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:31.760]  and so diabolical it's almost like even responding to it in a conventional way adds power to it
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:42.000]  i mean you see what i'm talking about more and more i think i should just do one video a day
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:50.320]  and cover the important issues for 10 minutes and then that's it that's all there is but no to
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:57.200]  to attack this system i had to attack it through its structure through its infrastructure through
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:02.160]  the way it was set up and i guess that's what a fish does it follows the stream it follows the river
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:10.640]  it follows out of the lakes and then to the big sea but you know i'm for i'm totally for real and
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:15.840]  i believe the things i'm saying and i know what i'm saying is real and to be quite honest with you
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:27.920]  i take off two days which is a long time for me two days straight and i'm blasted right now i don't
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:33.200]  get all excited and happy when i see an article the one in telegraph where they admit the government
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:38.800]  kidnaps children for no reason to fill quotas and that they're picking them by hair color and eye
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:44.080]  color you know 15 years ago i'd get excited about an article like that like oh i get to expose the
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:50.880]  evil you know this will show people how evil the system is and then i realize wait a minute no this
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:56.400]  is just part of acclimation okay the government kidnaps kids for no reason okay they ship narcotics
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:02.400]  in okay they're poison in the water okay they're growing the opium hi this is alex jones did you
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:06.560]  know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.800]  near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:15.440]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds and all perform even golden silver before in this
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:20.400]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:26.320]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:31.760]  produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:36.480]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant

[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:15.520]  um I've been listening to you since November a friend of mine sent me a text on Obama deception
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:19.760]  and ever since then I've been watching all your videos and finding out what's been going on in
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:28.000]  the world I wanted to give you two quick solutions and then a really good news report one one thing
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.720]  I'm a prison I'm a prison planet subscriber thank you sir I couldn't do it without you
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:38.560]  yeah I just think I wanted to encourage all the other listeners kind of like
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:44.800]  if all the Christians hide then we'd be able to change the world but you know all we have to do
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.280]  is stop buying Starbucks and McDonald's and movies and everyone can uh oh I think all your
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:54.320]  listeners could afford five or six dollars a month to support you to I would like if Michael Moore is
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:59.360]  allowed to get his films in the theaters I think uh we should be able to support you so you could do
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:04.560]  that but I do think the biggest solution to interrupt you just to add to what you're saying
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:13.040]  is promoting the alternative media into the mainstream media we need to supplant the corporate
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:19.840]  lying globalist propaganda arms and they know that they know we are starting to endanger them
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:24.880]  and that's why they're now trying to openly shut down the internet and why they're demonizing
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:30.880]  their competition that's actually good news the establishment would just be ignoring us and others
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.280]  if we weren't having an effect uh Barney so that's a really good point people always ask me well
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:44.160]  what are solutions well states rights tenth amendment uh getting healthy getting informed uh calling
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:49.600]  for criminal charges against the bankers but the biggest thing is if nobody points out that BP is
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:54.560]  clearly involved in a false flag here if nobody points out that Obama is blocking the aid effort
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:03.120]  here then no one will know that so it really is the perception issue we've got to counter the
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:08.400]  establishment's lies with the truth go ahead yeah there's so many of us that you know believe what
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:12.880]  you're saying and we see you know been woken up but the simplest thing we can do is to support
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:18.400]  somebody who's out there on the front lines doing it because in our daily lives we get so busy so we
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:23.040]  you know at the end of our 60 or 70 years on the surface there's only so much we can do but if we
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:28.320]  support somebody in a very practical way then we can get the message out because it's really hard
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:35.920]  to talk to i work in Hispanic media it's hard to talk to educated or uh middle class people
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:40.560]  i live in the suburbs of Dallas and it's like you can't really get a conversation going because
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:45.680]  there's so much information they think they kind of treat you like like you're crazy or whatever
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:50.880]  like your conspiracy theorist but whenever i've seen my friends actually watch the videos your
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:57.600]  videos then they get it so oh no that's why people Barney i mean this is probably the
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:03.840]  no exaggeration the third fourth i don't know five thousand times because it happens
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:09.760]  hundreds of times a year where people on air as callers and in emails and on the street
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:14.640]  say i couldn't wake my father or my mother or my son or my daughter up or my boss or my employee
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:22.080]  or my pastor i couldn't wake my rabbi up whatever the case is i couldn't wake my imam up until i gave
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:28.240]  them in game blueprint for global enslavement terror storm and the films really are the most
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:34.560]  important work i do because the radio show is informative the news websites are informative
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:41.280]  but the films i'm really able to give people a full spectrum breakdown and with that negative
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:46.800]  information they're able to really then wake themselves and others up and that's why prison
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:52.240]  planet dot tv is so important because people can then download the shows the radio interviews the
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:58.320]  video interviews all the films and burn them to disc and give them to people on any subject they
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.320]  want to inform them with and so that is a very exciting point that you just made Barney because
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:11.680]  the films are the way to go and i wanted to give you a good report um my brother tim donnelly
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:18.400]  in he lives in california in the 59th district uh that's the san bernonito county and part of
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:24.800]  los angeles county he uh just three months ago he's a patriot he was actually in 05 one of the
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:34.000]  founding members and president of the uh of the minute men movement and he won the primary the
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:42.720]  republican primary with only 24 000 to stay there stay there i'm going right back to you thank you

[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:57.280]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:02.560]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:08.080]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:13.360]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:18.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:23.760]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:28.320]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:32.960]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:21.520]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:24.160]  all right we've got a
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:32.480]  long way to go in a short time to get there and i promised to start getting into more of the news
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:41.200]  and breaking it down and i will do that as soon as i've talked to barney brian eric laura and gill
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:47.360]  at least that group of callers that have been holding the longest and then i'm getting into
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:59.040]  the news and let me tell you the news says a lot the news says more with a story than what is just
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:04.800]  on the surface the fact that the mainstream media admits we're now in a depression
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:16.080]  that's bad that's why i haven't covered it in two hours a issue this big
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:26.000]  it's just unbelievable we're going to have a 20 year long depression
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:35.600]  and at the end of that it only gets worse the globalists are destroying our society right
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:39.200]  in front of us and they're getting away with it yeah a lot of people are getting upset no
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:47.120]  are waking up and oh alex jones is bigger than ever and growing exponentially and so what i feel
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:55.200]  like a sack of crap and i and i i shouldn't even get up here on air and say that it's not that i
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:02:01.840]  can't handle the responsibility it's just that i cannot believe that i'm in this position
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:08.560]  and it makes my brain hurt to focus on it i don't know how to explain it i'm just sick of it i'm
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:13.600]  sick of looking at barack obama i'm sick of looking at the republicans i'm sick of looking at the
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:19.200]  heads of these oil companies these bankers now say tongues on the info wars dot com front page
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:24.960]  makes me want to throw up looking at that demonic chipmunk i'm just sick of thugs and trash and
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:32.480]  liars i want them out of my life and i can't believe how stupid people are out there that serve this
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:37.920]  system who love petty power trips i just don't like evil i'm gonna i'm gonna be flat out honest
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:44.720]  with you and i can't believe that i'm a good guy i always grew grew up thinking i was bad and then i
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:50.400]  was evil because i had bad thoughts and i was aggressive and but that's just being a man
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:58.160]  man at least i'm not a snake who stabs people on the back i'm sorry i said i'm gonna take your calls
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:06.160]  i just america is dying folks i don't know how else to say it i can't hardly do the show
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:13.360]  barney we got about a minute and a half i'm gonna come back with our callers finish up your points
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:18.080]  you're so you're saying somebody you know just i just want a primary with only 20 something thousand
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:24.400]  dollars everybody who's seen as an incumbent or as an establishment person is losing everyone who's
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:31.440]  seen as a patriot uh is is is winning and and that is very positive news so i should be more
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:36.320]  positive go ahead i want to let you know that it is uh he he was one of the founding members of the
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.040]  minute men movement which was to get the attention the national attention on the problem of the
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:45.440]  border which it did the media of course spin didn't play the race card i work in hispanic
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:50.880]  media and speak spanish so i saw that happen out here the stories from him and then see it on the
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:55.360]  news and it was totally different but either way three months ago he decided he got fed up and
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:03.440]  only three months before the primary he decided to run and there's 500 000 people in that district
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:08.480]  which is part of los angeles county and san mernino county and there's only 80 districts in
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:14.800]  california so it's kind of the other the closest opponent spent 160 000 and the in the
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:20.880]  establishment opponent who got all the support only got 10 of the vote so he got about 30 of
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:25.680]  the vote but i wanted to inspire other people because even me i'm now inspired i've never
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:30.880]  been into politics but you know to get a real patriot i think we should start at the state
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:36.000]  level instead of like never madina i agree with you i agree with you and people have got to see
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.640]  themselves as the leader it doesn't mean you have all the answers doesn't mean you're not

[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:25.120]  at prisonplanet.tv we're gonna have wide open phones throughout the next two hours
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.800]  and we're gonna cover a ton of news like down repeats great depression pattern
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:36.880]  that's what we've been telling you for two years it took them two to three years to admit
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:44.480]  they were in a depression in 1929 and 1933 the same bankers ran that scam so we're gonna break
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:50.400]  that down also with the us trapped in depression this really is starting to feel like 1932
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:55.920]  london telegraph you know about the new york times last week the third depression why are they
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:04.240]  suddenly all reporting the truth the truth so far so far as yeah we're really in a depression
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:09.280]  but not who's behind it how do we get out of it how do we bring those behind it to justice
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:15.520]  so that they don't keep doing it in the future i'm gonna go to your calls but i want to just
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:20.960]  say this simply and succinctly right now i'm going to get back into it later it isn't enough to throw
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:29.360]  out every incumbent it isn't enough to just educate yourself on the fact that there is a
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:35.360]  world government and there are offshore private banks that are robbing us people have to also
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:42.000]  really grow up and face the facts even if it is horrifying that the controllers of this planet are
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:50.720]  eugenicist and that they are poisoning our water and our food and our air by design
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:59.440]  to introduce chemicals and toxins into our food chain that will lower
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:07.200]  our standard of living our quality of life that will cause degenerative diseases that they can
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:14.160]  then make money off of treating them in the future and that will ultimately basically sterilize the
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:20.240]  majority of the population this is their stated goal and this is clearly what they are doing
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:24.880]  all right let's go ahead and go to your phone calls let's talk to brian in tennessee go ahead
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:31.440]  brian thanks for holding hey alex how's it going buddy good sir uh i just wanted to i don't have
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:36.160]  any information uh about the golf but i have something important uh i want to talk to you about
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:40.560]  the patriot act which will definitely come into effect if they start evacuating millions of people
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:45.840]  and using guns uh yesterday i was laying in bed i was reading the con uh the constitution
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:52.160]  and uh i couldn't believe it my my job out fell out when i when i was reading the tenth amendment
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:11:01.360]  and uh now look at the ninth amendment and and it just suddenly dawned on me that the the patriot act
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:10.480]  act has is no more genuine than a three dollar bill and that the the only reason that the thing can
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:17.280]  exist is because most of the american people are ignorant of their rights in the constitution
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:23.120]  and they're intimidated and they don't question anything but on its own legs it's not a valid law
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:28.720]  all right for for instance in the fourth amendment you know it talks about how
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:35.360]  you can't have any unlawful searches and seizures and the patriot act obviously extends
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:40.560]  more of that to the to the government so that where they can come in the system lied and said
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:46.640]  that sneak and peek and all the rest of that wouldn't be used on citizens and it has been and now
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:52.160]  they use it in regular law enforcement uh absolutely it was written for the american people
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:59.520]  and the patriot act conservatively nullifies five of the ten uh articles in the bill of rights
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:06.000]  but it says plainly here's the thing this is what's so crazy it says in the ninth amendment the
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:14.880]  enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:22.480]  retained by the people so you cannot take any of the rights in the constitution from the people
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:27.200]  play it's it's there in plain black and white is the ninth amendment is is probably the most
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:33.280]  important amendment there and then further in the tenth amendment just further expound on it and
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:41.840]  says the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by the states
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:50.320]  are reserved to the states respectively or to the people so i mean i don't understand it's it's so
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:57.440]  cut and dry how how can we listen listen it's cut and dry that the government can't just say we'll
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:04.080]  kill us citizens anywhere we want in the united states or worldwide if someone in the pentagon
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:09.600]  or white house thinks they might be a terrorist and people say well we gotta get tough on the
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:16.480]  terrorist then you go research who the terrorists are 99 of the time literally it is a staged
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:22.880]  government event and of course you don't let the government just arrest and take away anybody they
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:29.680]  want to a dungeon i mean of course that's the greatest threat not some turbaned guy who wants
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:35.840]  to blow up a school even if that turbaned guy actually exists which in most cases they don't
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:41.280]  there is some real muslim terrorist out there from the research i've done but but most of it
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:48.240]  is government and and most of the real stuff is basically copycat from the government stuff and
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:52.960]  you know this is an elementary statement you're making brian but it's also very profound that's
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:14:01.440]  why i'm dumbfounded so much is this is openly treason it is openly criminal but the government
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:07.920]  government knows they're doing that i mean listen having the military running checkpoints all over
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:12.560]  the country with local police and training with foreign troops to take on the american people
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:18.240]  and the federal government secretly training tens of thousands of preachers now on record i mean
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:22.480]  this was secret when we first reported it now it now it's oh yes the government's working secretly
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:28.160]  with preachers through to prepare their flocks to go to fema camps i mean how creepy is that if you
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:34.080]  go watch the running man from the mid-1980s it's it's like where's my brother oh he was permanently
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:38.480]  detained you know you go watch firefox like i said in the first hour with clain eastwood
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:45.840]  from the late 1970s and he goes to visit russia and they search his bags and he's shocked by the
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:53.680]  incredible police state i mean again we are living in the soviet union and so secret arrest is being
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:15:00.320]  promoted shutting down free speeches being promoted taking everybody's bank accounts not giving people
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:05.600]  money in the last week i've seen all these mainstream media reports put it out there
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:10.880]  oh i guess the health care bill didn't cover pre-existing conditions and those with really
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:17.280]  bad conditions oh it does cut your benefits and raise your taxes oh and see they don't care if
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:23.440]  you find out obama's a liar and his approval rating you know drops like the approval rating a gonorrhea
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:29.520]  because they'll just put a new puppet in this was all meant to happen all and the whole fake debate
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:34.960]  i mean it's and to see our fellow americans buying this hook line and sinker anything else brian
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:42.800]  yes sir uh my frustration is is is much like yours but it seems to me i mean am i wrong in
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:50.000]  saying that the power from the so-called laws and acts like like the patriot act uh they get their
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:56.880]  power from the ignorance of the 99 of the american people in other words if 300 million americans
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:16:03.040]  realized the ninth and tenth amendments and what they meant that the patriot act would simply just
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:08.160]  fall apart like a house of cards exactly i appreciate your call that's why i had the idea
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:12.320]  and threw it out over eight years ago on air and then others picked it up and ran with it
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:17.760]  and that's the power of this show we have great guests with really great ideas we have wonderful
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:26.160]  callers with just amazing ideas and if any one of you out there can just implement these ideas in
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:32.800]  your town in your city in your state then it is a model for the rest of the country in the world
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:37.280]  that's why they're so scared of anyone standing up that's why they want to make you feel powerless
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:43.360]  and i had the idea of having the states via the ninth and tenth amendment nullify the patriot act
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:48.640]  and we couldn't get that done so i said how about counties and cities and then other people picked
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:56.000]  up the idea and over 800 cities and four states passed laws against the patriot act and we stood
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:02.240]  up and said no this is unconstitutional then that gave moral support to courts who've stood up and
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:09.840]  said it's unconstitutional okay and so it's always a struggle the tyrants always wanting your freedoms
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:17.760]  and you're always having to stand up and secure those freedoms uh let's go ahead and talk i mean
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:22.400]  what does the bill of rights talk about well we've gotten our country we've gotten our constitution
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:24.960]  now we need to secure that with this bill of rights
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:32.160]  i mean do you lock your house when you go out of town do you secure do you put your child
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:39.200]  in a safety seat in a car to try to secure them uh do you stop smoking cigarettes so you secure
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:45.680]  that you won't die lung cancer again you can't just go to the bar every day after work and get drunk
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:51.440]  and be free there are crooks who will take over government that has the power to rob your butt
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:59.680]  let's go to eric in california on the air eric hey alex hey buddy hey uh long time listener uh
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:05.920]  sometime contributor not a prison planet member but i do buy every one of your videos and i do

[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:17.040]  tell you after being a lifelong Levi's wear my boys couldn't be happier if you know what i mean
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:25.520]  the key keys are comfortable okay so what else is on your mind sir hey buddy i was just a
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:33.440]  woken this morning uh July 5th 2010 to a police helicopter and very untypical of this area they
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:39.680]  were only the loudspeaker uh given the description of an armed robberies suspect but what it did is
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:48.320]  it it made me it finally dawned on me how badly the police state needs us and let me just preface
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:55.200]  that by by saying back uh when the legal immigration uh movement first started and there was those big
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:19:01.520]  demonstrations in la do you remember those i don't remember the year that um you remember when
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:09.600]  there was like 500 000 marching through la and then uh then we had the may 1st um demonstration
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:15.040]  shortly after that that's when i got involved well in my town my town was one of few that got
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:22.560]  reported of any instances of violence from the uh illegal immigrant population and uh in my town
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:27.520]  what they had to do is they had to pull from all different counties they had to gather up about
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:37.200]  400 uh goons enforcers to uh to call the riot and i'll come back and uh finish up yeah finish up
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:41.200]  your point and then we'll continue but i'm gonna try to finish up this call her quickly and then
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:45.920]  a few others because i really we're two and a half hours in here ladies and gentlemen and i need to
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:49.520]  i've covered quite a bit of news but not as much as i want to i want to get into
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.640]  the fact that the media is now admitting we're in a depression
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:57.680]  and that our country is going to collapse
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:05.360]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator

[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:26.080]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:31.200]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:36.000]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:41.520]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind

[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:51.600]  trust the police and therefore they won't help us fight crime um this is another example of what
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:59.520]  i'm saying they need us for this police state hi harry and i appreciate your call those are
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:07.760]  really good points that you've made the problem is people need to have their own judgment if the
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:13.600]  police are asking for your help to find a missing child that's a good thing or if they're asking
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:20.240]  for your help to go fight a forest fire you should saddle up and do it but through an emergency alert
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:28.800]  system that is to find missing children now it's got anti gun messages and just random messages about
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:35.280]  spying on your neighbor so they always use something that sounds reasonable to then push a complete
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:44.160]  takeover of society you'll also notice that the irs will visit a sacramento car cleaner
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:54.720]  car wash for a four cent unpaid ticket or four cent unpaid bill and send armed officers not once but
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:26:00.560]  twice threatening to arrest them if they didn't pay the four cents they had to even send them a letter
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:06.320]  but see that's how they waste resources those on top know how to deploy them where they never
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:11.680]  actually stop any real crime i mean i mean here's an article interpol asked web servers
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:20.480]  to catch fugitives interpol has been caught in europe with dinecore with halliburton with the un all
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:27.120]  over eastern europe running the child kidnapping and uh the international prostitution i mean that's
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:31.840]  come out in government document for government document just google un caught kidnapping women
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:38.480]  and children in europe you'll get bbc you name it and then read interpol comes up time and time
[02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:44.800]  again in there so it says international police agency interpol on monday urged internet users to
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:50.880]  help track down hundreds of fugitives wanted for murder rape and sexual child abuse and other
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:54.880]  serious crimes well why don't they go arrest some of the people in their own department
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:03.120]  again interpol is the federal police of every nation in europe and when you go to a hotel this
[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:08.720]  has been going on for 30 years or more in europe you are registered into the interpol system
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:14.640]  everywhere you go is being watched but this is done so the criminals that run the society
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:22.160]  can be protected let's say one of these criminals ripped you off or killed your wife or uh and and
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:26.000]  you're going to go to that european country next door to you say you're in spain you're going to
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.880]  go to portugal and this happens all the time and they have a computer system that statistically
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:40.480]  you'll know okay uh this guy from spain is coming to portugal our actuaries our analysis shows
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:46.800]  there's a 79 chance he's planning to do harm uh to this fellow that lives in portugal and they see
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:51.840]  you going from your city 500 miles away to a particular city in portugal and then when you
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:58.720]  get off the airplane or when you pull into your hotel an hour later there's a knock on your door
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:05.840]  or why are you here why are you in portugal and so interpol is mainly to make sure these globalists
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:10.320]  can commit their crimes and get away with it i mean large portions this has come out of news
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:17.040]  reported for news report and some have been caught of the european elite are openly satanist and are
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:21.360]  openly pedophiles it's it's you don't get in the club like a lot of republican congressmen
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:27.440]  you've got to be gay i mean that's kind of the club here uh or with democrats it's it's always been
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:32.640]  in for some reason to rape women i don't know why but it just keeps coming up that's kind of the
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:37.120]  club they like to slap women around uh bill clinton likes to bite them all he rapes him to hold
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:43.920]  him down he bites him on the lips like a bulldog bites a bull um but that's what they do and and
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:49.600]  in europe it's it's it's pedophile run and so anybody trying to get justice interpol is there
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:54.080]  protect the pedophiles period and see if you really want freedom folks you're gonna have to
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:58.880]  actually go research what i said and find out i didn't just say that to be shocking okay that's
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:05.040]  actually true okay and and 15 years of deep research it's just everywhere you could find
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:13.680]  that out in five minutes just doing a search about it uh but um here's what i'm gonna do okay
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:18.960]  because i i keep saying i'm gonna get to the news and then i don't um we're gonna come back from break

[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:37.840]  wow and yeah i've been listening to you since you first came out and what i want to say is that
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:45.120]  why don't we separate former own colonies join together take america back take what's ours back
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:49.760]  why are we gonna just sit here and wait till u n kicks in our door and hauls us off to a
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.720]  female where are we gonna start a colony how are we gonna fund the colony how are we gonna stop
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:34:00.480]  secret agents from coming in to our colony that's open and infiltrating it and committing
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:05.200]  crimes and blaming it on us i mean they are openly setting up the secret police model all over the
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:09.920]  western world they have secret police now grabbing us canadian and british citizens
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:16.480]  and putting bags over their heads on tv to send the message of we will snatch you we will grab you
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:22.240]  those cops are being trained to snatch and grab and then now openly take someone to a dungeon
[02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:27.680]  to be tortured and ever seen again they're actually promoting that on the news and they started the
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:33.280]  snatching and grabbing part and they're telling us torture is good so i mean i'm not trying to
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:39.280]  poo poo your idea and it's kind of like the free state project people moving to uh new hampshire
[02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:45.520]  but and i'm all for people's forming little communities but now they're harassing the amish
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:52.880]  using environmental rules uh to try to take their kids and take their land i mean i i agree with you
[02:34:52.880 --> 02:35:03.200]  that's a logical thing to do the problem is uh there's nowhere to go wow it just thickens me
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:09.920]  i'm like you i'm up at night i'm pacing around i just i'm just sick of it i'm sick of them stripping
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:14.800]  away our freedoms i'm just tired of it well ma'am we're gonna win we've got to educate people about
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:20.720]  who the globalists are and how their systems work and how they convert societies into tyrannies
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:24.640]  and then we are going to wake people up we're going to take back our congress they're going to try
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:29.680]  to stage terror attacks they're going to launch new wars but we've got to just realize their tricks
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:34.480]  keep educating people about their tricks and then bring them to justice in it because we don't have
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:40.640]  any other choice it's going to have to be done anything else laura i just want to say that i
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:47.120]  highly respect you i've been on your side for many years and i've been on america's side even longer
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:52.400]  and i just know that we will win in the end and hang in there don't give up i know you're discouraged
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:57.440]  because i can hear it sometimes in your voice i get that way too but god bless america let's get her
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:07.760]  back laura thank you you know it's not that i'm discouraged i'm intellectually pleased
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:15.360]  that we're gaining so much headway but now i realize that the battle is joined and that the system is
[02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:23.440]  now taking our resistance serious and i'm just every day more and more dumbfounded by how real
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:33.120]  this is you want to think more of your fellow man and to just have everything we ever covered
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:42.960]  confirmed in triplicate it's not a good feeling i'm not happy i'm right i wish i was a kook i
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:48.560]  wish i was a conspiracy theorist and i see people on the youtube comment boards and i see them on
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:56.720]  the info wars and prison planet you know i made a video friday about the economic implosion that's
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:37:06.000]  happening and how it's by design and it was emergency s os america being taken over by
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:12.560]  offshore banks and i saw about half the people commenting going off shut up conspiracy theorists
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:19.920]  none of this is happening there's no problem uh your trash your scum they don't even have
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:26.640]  self-preservation instincts i mean everything i said in that 15 minute video that's had over 100
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:36.000]  thousand views is on the record now world government the un wanting to scrap the dollar for a global sdr
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:42.320]  private banks ruling us i mean i live in a republic i rule myself i am the sovereign i
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:49.040]  my ancestors like your ancestors created this country and it's not perfect but it's a lot
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:54.880]  better than some offshore swindlers who call themselves banks this criminal ruling class
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:38:02.480]  dominating me i mean i don't like being conquered i mean it these people really openly are on the
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:07.440]  news saying we'll arrest any citizens we want and we'll torture them and they're paying private
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:14.080]  contractors to throw bags over people's heads and throw them in vans all over the world on the news
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:19.440]  and the news reports it like it's well the police are letting private contractors arrest people
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:24.000]  and it shows someone with a bag being thrown with their head being drugged into a car that's being
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:31.280]  done to acclimate everyone where cops and others just think it's normal we're being lowered down
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:40.400]  into the acid right now and it's going to make people wake up but i you know i'm sitting there
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:47.600]  i'm sitting there watching this this war this battle being joined and and i'm in the fight but
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:54.880]  i'm also in like a general's perspective looking at it and i'm just like why did this have to
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:00.720]  happen what and i see these masses of people who aren't awake and i care about them i love them i
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:06.320]  want them to have freedom i want them to control their own destiny i want them to not be slaves
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:12.160]  and then they're laughing at me and i don't even get angry at them they're pathetic it it makes me
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:18.560]  feel sick you ever seen somebody do something bad that your friends with or somebody you know and
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:25.360]  it's like an embarrassed feeling you feel embarrassed i feel embarrassed i guess overall
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:31.200]  that's i just feel embarrassed how pathetic we are but then i also know how great humans are and
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:38.800]  the art the literature the bravery the ingenuity i just love humanity so much and i know my children
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:43.600]  are part of humanity and i want them to grow up and have a good future and i want my daughters
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:48.720]  to find good loving strong men uh who care about them and want to build them up
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:55.680]  and i want my son to find a good woman to be his wife and then i and i do think about my god i
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:40:02.080]  brought children into this world but i've i had to do over again i would because i can't give up
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:09.200]  but still it freaks me out i'm like what in the world truth is so much stranger than fiction as
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:22.160]  they say and it's true that this is so bizarre and it's all admitted i mean i knew in 1999
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:27.840]  that they were putting microphones up everywhere with the nsa listening for keywords and recording
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:34.480]  it i found the documents found the reports but it's in the news today it's all over the news
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:40.000]  that hey guess what microphones have been put up to record you in malls and on the street
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:46.240]  and other places and computers are going to be analyzing what you say i mean folks they're
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:51.760]  admitting they ship in the drugs they're admitting they run white slavery range they're admitting they
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:56.800]  got microphones listening to us they're admitting they're arresting citizens and secretly detaining
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:04.800]  them and executing them before the laws even passed i mean this is bad this is real bad and see
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:09.760]  in the past i thought well they haven't killed me they have threatened me and other things but
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:12.480]  because they don't want to underline and highlight everything i've said
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:18.560]  but more than that they just think so little of you that they think there's nothing you're
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:23.520]  gonna do about it because you don't see yourselves as leaders you don't see yourself in a role of
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:29.760]  standing up you wouldn't know how to stand up they think because you expect everything instantly
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:34.400]  they think they they think that your weak mind didn't shallow and that they can do these things
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:39.920]  now they're starting to shift they're starting to see that we've got a good chance of defeating
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:46.720]  them if people get a winning spirit if people get a winning attitude and have the facts
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:53.760]  you've were determined and they understand that i've got a lot of problems but i am determined
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:59.520]  and i've had a lot of success against the enemy and they know that people see that as a model
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:07.680]  of future success and so they are scared of us yeah there's our story from what four years ago
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:12.640]  government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million americans that's from
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:19.600]  prisonplanet.com september 6 2006 by the way where did that come from google put out a stinkin press
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:25.440]  release and i got called a kook by several newspapers for writing for heaven paul watson
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:30.320]  write an article about it and then now today they come out and admit
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:40.800]  i mean do i have to explain to people at the government listening to you inside your house
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:48.400]  without a warrant is tyranny i mean i mean just just four years ago bush was strutting around
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:57.200]  on television at press conferences saying i am not spying on the american people these
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:02.240]  warrenals wiretaps are only for al-qaeda and then of course it came out that there were hundreds
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:08.880]  of thousands of them uh literally different mass wiretaps listening to tens of millions of americans
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:14.160]  randomly and that they had premeditatedly lied of course they did bush had that big you know
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:19.680]  what eating ground on his face he enjoys it it's funny to him bush sees you as an animal he's a
[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:25.440]  psychopath he sees you as a piece of meat that's why he'll even wipe his glasses on clinton's coat
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:32.640]  or he'll he'll be on jay leno or or on other shows and you know before the show a woman walks by
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:39.040]  to adjust uh somebody else's makeup and he'll grab their dress and clean his glasses because
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:44.480]  you're seen as a piece of tissue paper he blows his snot into it and throws it in the trash
[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:59.840]  in fact they found it so quickly there he is cleaning his his glasses on her and and and as
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:04.160]  soon as you get that you know people say that's not happening in america that's a conspiracy
[02:44:04.160 --> 02:44:10.400]  theory that is you literally in a trance under mind control rationalizing whenever your face
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:15.920]  was something that threatens you and that scares you you just say that's not true that's not true
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:23.120]  that's not real look it's real okay it's so much more real i can't even describe it to you
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:28.720]  and for all of you out there and a lot of it's a snowball effect they admittedly have government
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:33.360]  psychological warfare databases of certain phrases and terms that they have discovered
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:41.200]  are effective with weak minded people and the easily influenced and you'll see these
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:45.680]  comments on youtube and everywhere else and you can even click on their handles and go to their
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:50.800]  websites and a lot of times they admit they're in army psyops or they work for a big corporation
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:58.320]  in public relations and they'll just come out and say you know none of this is true you're a
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:07.360]  tinfoil hat wearer and and the simpler the more mindless it is the more effective it is until
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:11.600]  they're psychologically ready to roll out with they think you're acclimated and conditioned enough
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:16.400]  to go from Alex is a crazy cook there's no microphones put up in your town to listen to you
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:22.560]  you know this guy's a nut to yeah we've put him out for over a decade and we're also listening
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:29.040]  to you in your house it's for your safety and then those people that were saying I was a kook
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:34.160]  they just go well of course we need microphones listening to us or they still keep lying and
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:38.800]  saying there is no article I could sit here on tv with all the articles where they're admittedly
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:44.960]  listening to you worse than 1984 and it's done to target you the good people that know what you're
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:50.400]  up to and to know how to manipulate you and it's known to see what economic decisions you're going
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:54.960]  to be making because they put it into these big aggregators to then make decisions on how to better
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:46:02.000]  rape you how to better manipulate you financially and they admit that the biggest way the nsa
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:12.560]  operates is they'll see a trend for say french bulldogs five years ago and they'll just give
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:18.320]  that information to a select board of corporations and then those corporations can use that data
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:23.920]  however they want if they want to put a french bulldog on a lunchbox knowing it'll sell easier
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:30.480]  which gives them an unfair trade advantage or the way one an essay guy described it to me
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:34.480]  the nsa doesn't know why but strawberries start getting real popular and everything strawberry
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:39.520]  strawberry strawberries then they know how to preposition from that they kind of boil it down
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:44.800]  in a simple way in vifer vendetta where it shows these trucks driving around with dishes on the
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:49.360]  roofs listening to what's happening in people's houses which they actually really do have
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:54.320]  with these acoustic microphones and
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:01.600]  they go into the board meeting with the police the fbi and others with the big brother fellow
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:09.680]  and they say uh the positive mention is uh down to a record level down to below 40 percent
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:14.960]  and they say that's it we've got to move now we're in deep trouble once it drops between 40 it's
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:20.480]  all over they are actually listening to you in your house they know what you really think of
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:26.320]  the government they know the majority of you know 9-11's an inside job they know many of you
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:30.560]  were waking up about the poison in the water they know you're waking up about the bankers being
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:37.360]  criminals they know the majority of you know that the oil leaks a staged event okay they know
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:43.520]  they know they know that we really do have four million web visitors a week they know we really
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:48.320]  do have between two to five million radio listeners a week depending on which week they know it's
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:53.360]  exponentially growing they're going to start a war folks they're going to blow oil wells they're
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:58.640]  going to stage crises they're going to stage mass shootings and blaming on patriots all in an attempt
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:10.400]  to shut you up to go along with this see there's no more denial for those of you out there that
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:16.800]  are childlike the government is listening to you google is the nsa they are listening to you in your
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:21.920]  house and watching you with the camera built in they are using your ipads your iphone's they are
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:26.880]  using all of the systems that are that are cell phone enabled they are using everything to track
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:33.760]  you it was designed to track you they are completely criminal if you're 38 years old or younger they
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:41.920]  took your blood at birth and put it in a bio weapons database i told you this 15 years ago
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:49.760]  it's now admitted this isn't a joke there isn't time to screw around listen cops listen military
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:56.960]  you are being poisoned you have got to choose sides and there's no decision you're already on our
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:02.880]  side you're already slated for extermination slow soft kill extermination getting more and more
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:08.960]  intense the system's already tested how to roll out a new plague have a celebrity lead the plague
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:14.720]  and to make sure they manage the plague so that real cures and the real cause is never found
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:21.600]  they already know how to make money out of killing you this isn't a joke this isn't a conspiracy
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:28.080]  theory it's a fact you've got to join us bureaucrats all of you people that go to these ivy league
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:33.360]  universities that are taught you're the elite and the public's a bunch of scum you're seeing
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:40.560]  a scum as well you're creating a hell planet all of you that work as bureaucrats or media people
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:47.440]  all of you that hold this system up the system is a meat grinder the system is a woodchipper
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:52.560]  and sure they were putting the blacks in 50 years ago when you laughed at them hearing them squeal
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:57.760]  now they've gotten up to you in the woodchipper are you going to continue to laugh about it
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:01.360]  are you going to continue to think you're a winner are you going to continue to think
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:06.480]  you're part of the winning team you're not on the winning team in this predatory system
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:14.400]  killing millions of innocent Arabs isn't funny the the troops growing opium in afghanistan
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:21.520]  isn't funny all of this will come back on us and is coming back on us the globalist
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:26.560]  hates you the american people much more than they hate the Arabs why are they killing the Arabs
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:30.800]  because they're have courage and they're independent and they have big families and
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:34.880]  they're certainly not perfect and have a lot of cultural problems as well everybody does
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:40.240]  but they are killing them because they're red-blooded folks they're taking them over
[02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:45.600]  so they can be exterminated to the soft kill weapons they don't have fluoridated water folks
[02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:52.560]  okay they still are red-blooded they are domesticating you to kill you they're

[02:54:18.560 --> 02:54:21.680]  the long time since i've spoken to you alex uh
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:26.960]  my god what can you say i mean i saw that statement where they actually held the troops
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:34.080]  protecting the poppy fields to effectively that's going to bring poison right here to this country
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:39.120]  we have high troops protecting the poison that's going to poison our own people isn't that crazy
[02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:44.880]  and they put it in our face this is the psi op they admit everything now they're now all over
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:51.840]  the news today i saw no fewer than five mainstream reports saying yes microphones have been put up
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:59.600]  to listen to you we called them gunshot detectors but we're really recording you an nsa software
[02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:05.520]  is tracking everything you do i mean this is incredible no security out here where i live
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:10.800]  but now we have nighttime security in a vehicle with a pretty yellow flashing lights i imagine
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:15.040]  they have the ability to listen in on the conversations in and around our apartment
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:22.400]  oh they found tar balls on crystal beach now here in texas and they're not wanting to admit or
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:29.840]  confirm that it's possibly from from the bp oil spill there's just so much going on i had a vision
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:37.040]  i hope it's not true of of blood in the skies here on the gulf coast and so you're down there
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:42.160]  by galveston and you're saying you're seeing tar balls coming up i'm near the boot i actually
[02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:48.880]  i'm actually in southeast texas boom i put out the orange area uh port natus where uh tex marz
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.720]  is scales from in in that area in fact i can spit and hit port natus from where i'm from and uh
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:59.840]  yeah they're saying they're they're having tar balls worship on on a galveston isle in the
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:06.880]  beach and then you know course the coast guard is in with the uh the industrial complex they're
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:12.320]  not going to admit that it's possibly possibly from that spill i'm hearing rumors also that this
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:17.680]  thing is is far beyond what what they're willing to admit that it's probably a lot worse and
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:26.400]  you know well first they said it was uh five thousand barrels a day then it was 10 then 20
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:33.760]  then 30 then 50 thousand barrels a day so they've lied so much i don't think anyone even knows but
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:40.000]  we do know from the satellite and aircraft photos that most the oil because it's coming up from five
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:45.920]  thousand feet under the water is in underwater plumes and so most the oil hasn't even gotten to the
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:53.360]  surface and as the gulf heats up in late summer to the temperature of a bathtub as it does every
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:57.920]  year as it takes again a whole summer for it to get hot it's such a large body but once it gets
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:03.200]  hot it gets really hot that all that oil is then going to come up because when it's cold for some
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:08.960]  reason it causes it to stay lower in the water and it's going to off gas all those gases and so this
[02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:16.640]  is just horrible and uh yeah the uh the reports i've seen are that hurricane alex did blow in
[02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:22.720]  a lot of that oil and some of it had drifted over towards texas and it's uh unconfirmed whether or
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:27.920]  not uh that's from that oil spill or some other spill because when everybody's busy watching this

[03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:39.440]  you for joining us okay let me go ahead and launch into this today this is really our top story
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:45.040]  uh and the issue here is not that the media is starting to admit that we're in a depression
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:52.080]  but that why did they cover it up this long and why are they now admitting it that means the
[03:00:52.080 --> 03:01:00.080]  establishment has made the decision to start coming out with this in the open that's a question
[03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:04.240]  i would feel to the listeners why do you think that's the case i have my take on it i'll be going
[03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:15.600]  over that here is cnbc dowell repeats great depression pattern and this is what our guest
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:20.880]  the economist we've had on had been saying for two years uh that we've really been in a recession
[03:01:20.880 --> 03:01:28.800]  for four a depression for two and that the charts mirror what happened in 29 through 33 they didn't
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:34.640]  announce that we were in a depression until the middle of 1933 and then of course the war powers
[03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:41.680]  act was declared and the united states was put under a form of economic martial law dowell repeats
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:46.240]  great depression pattern the charts show the dowell jones industrial average is repeating a
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:53.600]  pattern that appeared just before markets fell during the great depression daryl guppy ceo at
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:02:01.840]  guppy traders told cnbc today those who don't remember history are doomed to repeat it there was
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:07.760]  a head and shoulders pattern that developed before the great depression in 1929 then with the
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:13.840]  recovery of 1930 we had another head and shoulders pattern that proceeded to fall in the market
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:19.280]  and in the current dowell situation we see an exact repeat of that environment guppy said
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:29.760]  the dowell retreated 457 points or 4.5 last week to close at 9686 and the globalist may go prop
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:34.880]  that up like i haven't looked at that we guys pull up the dowel it was at 9686 friday let's see what
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:41.920]  it is today guppy said a dowell fall below 9800 confirmed the head and shoulders pattern
[03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:48.240]  the shanghai composite is seeing a very rapid collapse following below 2500 which suggests a
[03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:54.320]  major fall in the dowel he added in the european markets guppy says frankford dax is witnessing
[03:02:54.320 --> 03:03:00.560]  a different pattern to london's fts e and again i put out an emergency alert friday
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:09.360]  sos emergency alert uh emergency sos is the name of the video you can search that term it's up on
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:15.120]  info wars dot com and present planet dot com and it states the facts the private central banks
[03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:19.920]  they're not even banks they're just fraudsters have shut this up in the last 15 years they've
[03:03:19.920 --> 03:03:32.880]  admitted they've set it up it's all pre planned and we've got to stop them i guess the dowels are
[03:03:32.880 --> 03:03:41.840]  down again today and 46 another 46 plus points 46.05 it's closed today okay i guess it's a holiday
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:50.560]  so that's friday it goes on to say uh dowell repeats great depression pattern here's another one
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:57.680]  with the us trapped in depression this really is starting to feel like 1932 and that's ambrose
[03:03:57.680 --> 03:04:06.000]  evans pritchard a very prestigious writer uh with the london telegraph the us workforce shrink
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:12.720]  652 thousand jobs in june one of the sharpest contractions ever that rate of hourly earnings
[03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:21.600]  fell 0.1 wages are flirting with deflation so they're devaluing the currency while you have
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:30.080]  depression in the real economy wall street's making record profits you've got deflation in wages
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:38.480]  but inflation in currency value now they didn't believe that could even exist until
[03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:43.520]  the late 70s it's stag inflation this is leaning towards hyper stag inflation
[03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:51.760]  i mean we live in a completely rigged economy and even msnbc had a headline or cnbc admitting
[03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:58.000]  that last week dylan radigan came out and said the entire stock market's rig it is it's a casino

[03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:58.080]  ourselves to and then they hold this hostage if you want the economy to come back if you want your
[03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:03.280]  pension fund if you want your retirement you've got to give us the bankers even more power over
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:08.880]  your economy you've got to give us trillions more and you give them the trillions and congress says
[03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:14.720]  and the parliament of england says and the eu says to the central banks where'd the money go
[03:09:14.720 --> 03:09:21.440]  and they say we're not going to tell you this is a swindle but because they're wearing $5,000
[03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:28.960]  designer suits and because they control your pension funds no one goes to jail because they're
[03:09:28.960 --> 03:09:37.680]  holding us hostage dowell repeats great depression pattern that's cnbc here's london telegraph
[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:44.640]  with the u.s. trapped in depression this really is starting to feel like 1932
[03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:51.200]  652,000 people lost their jobs in the month of june alone
[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:56.480]  ladies and gentlemen we've known for four years we've been in a recession
[03:09:57.040 --> 03:10:02.160]  all the economists we've had on you can see it around you in business they were telling you the
[03:10:02.160 --> 03:10:06.320]  economy was great four years ago they've been telling you it's been getting better the last
[03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:15.520]  year and a half baloney anyone in business anyone in the real world i mean 46 states on the verge
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:20.880]  of collapsing according to bloomberg and the federal government's own admissions is that a
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:27.760]  recovering country 46 states on the verge of collapsing but the big private megabanks goldman
[03:10:27.760 --> 03:10:36.640]  sacks jp morgan chase city group bank of america they're all doing good with record profits and
[03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:45.520]  taking over everything so they tell you the economy is great and without even looking today
[03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:50.720]  i've got a stack of mainstream news articles about how we're in a depression suddenly they're
[03:10:50.720 --> 03:10:56.640]  admitting we're in a depression why because they're going to scare us again and say well
[03:10:56.640 --> 03:11:02.800]  you better give the federal reserve unlimited power over the entire economy over every facet of the
[03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:13.360]  economy or they won't be able to fix it they told you that a year and a half ago and now they
[03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:19.040]  can offer their new global currency and their str as the solution to the crisis they've created
[03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:22.880]  that's why they've already milked us they've already gotten us positioned they've got us where
[03:11:22.880 --> 03:11:27.360]  they want us they wanted to get us deeper into a depression and more in debt to them and they've
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:36.560]  done that now and they're coming back saying gee we just want to save the economy and it is like
[03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:42.720]  having a 10 pound tumor growing on the side of your heart if we do remove the tumor it may kill us
[03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:50.720]  but if we don't remove the tumor we're dead i mean we're that ingratiated and that integrated
[03:11:50.720 --> 03:11:57.040]  in with these crooks we they've made it where we're dependent on them that's the whole ball game
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:03.920]  a ponzi scheme that's too big to fail that's the name of their game a ponzi scheme too big to fail
[03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:09.360]  that's designed to fail and when it fails it conquers you economically
[03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:17.600]  you remember this headline last week the third depression paul krugman new york times wire but
[03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:20.800]  of course his answer is given the government the federal reserve more power and more money
[03:12:21.920 --> 03:12:26.320]  more spending your money and they've already decided they're going to devalue the dollar
[03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:32.960]  and on its assage build the new s dr that you pay carbon taxes to think of the magnitude
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:39.120]  of what's happening right now and then i saw stacks of these articles without even looking

[03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:39.280]  and steal everything they've got and the police refuse to even help i mean it's just
[03:27:39.280 --> 03:27:46.080]  total collapse of society the globalists love it the u.s government has declared some parts of
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:50.400]  arizona off limits to u.s citizens that's number 26 because the threat of violence
[03:27:50.400 --> 03:27:56.320]  for mexican drug smugglers number 25 we're halfway through and every one of these i read i can think
[03:27:56.320 --> 03:28:02.160]  of 10 or 15 things even worse that are going on uh 25 according to the credit card repayment
[03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:07.760]  calculator if you owe 6 000 on a credit card with a 20 interest rate and only pay a minimum

[03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:19.680]  you will pay 26 168 dollars in interest rate changes in addition to the 6 000 principle
[03:28:19.680 --> 03:28:25.200]  that you are required to pay back so you'll pay uh 22 000 plus dollars
[03:28:25.200 --> 03:28:34.560]  yeah 23 000 plus i don't know 33 000 dollars 26 000 and 6 000 so uh you'll be paying uh
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:40.800]  over 30 000 dollars that's kind of like you know the central banks they own a billion
[03:28:40.800 --> 03:28:45.040]  dollars or somebody they made up they end up paying back 50 billion they still owe 50 billion
[03:28:45.040 --> 03:28:50.640]  that's like nigeria i love to use that example 24 according to prepared testimony by goldman

[03:29:24.960 --> 03:29:30.320]  product and when they're done they'll have over a hundred percent how is that possible they'll
[03:29:30.320 --> 03:29:38.160]  loan everything and you'll owe them a bunch of interest on it so it'll be more i mean it's like

[03:33:25.120 --> 03:33:33.520]  frontline story here uh of a photographer they'd hired to go down to texas city and take photos
[03:33:33.520 --> 03:33:38.720]  of the bp refinery this is the same one that had a big leak a few years ago and they got a big
[03:33:38.720 --> 03:33:43.760]  fine over it and the cops showed up and they said we don't care you don't take photos in america
[03:33:47.360 --> 03:33:53.520]  i uh was coming back from the beach about a year ago and this was down in corpus christie
[03:33:53.520 --> 03:33:59.280]  i was coming back from port aransas and i was getting on an access road and saw this big
[03:33:59.280 --> 03:34:05.120]  refinery and i said you know i always need b-roll for my films and i want to expose all the carbon
[03:34:05.120 --> 03:34:11.840]  tax has meant to shut down our society and i might mention that the big oil companies are
[03:34:11.840 --> 03:34:19.040]  actually financing it and that they got together in 96 this has been declassified well not declassified
[03:34:19.040 --> 03:34:26.880]  the ap associated press sued and uh got those minutes in 2000 we've written articles about it
[03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:34.320]  and covered it if you want to go pull the stories up where they shut down all of the uh refineries
[03:34:34.320 --> 03:34:39.840]  that they didn't own or bought them up and closed them to create an artificial bottleneck because
[03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:44.240]  there's too much oil and so they want to keep prices up how do they do that they shut down
[03:34:44.240 --> 03:34:50.800]  refining capacity they fund environmental groups who go out and lobby against it and then they
[03:34:50.800 --> 03:34:55.680]  themselves sit back and make fun of the very groups they financed i mean this is on record
[03:34:57.840 --> 03:35:04.240]  so that's how they create that artificial scarcity and i this is no exaggeration i pulled up
[03:35:07.120 --> 03:35:13.360]  by that big refinery right before you get on 37 to go north i pulled up i got out with a video
[03:35:13.360 --> 03:35:25.600]  camera on a tripod and filmed the refinery i cut down the side street and the refinery was about
[03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:30.960]  two miles away it's just giant sprawling facility there were no cars around me no one around me
[03:35:32.080 --> 03:35:38.880]  i got in my car driving a minivan got on the highway entrance ramp got back on the highway
[03:35:38.880 --> 03:35:51.040]  and violently coming down from another entrance ramp was a texas state police officer who got

[03:43:13.120 --> 03:43:17.600]  why they're doing it and that's used by the cia later to carry out some type of operation that
[03:43:17.600 --> 03:43:21.760]  was just randomly throwing out you know a possibility i'm not saying that's what's

[03:46:19.920 --> 03:46:29.840]  is a gusher um uh never talked about he never talked about the people the effect of the economy
[03:46:29.840 --> 03:46:34.880]  you ever talked about no it's all listen we played a clip of obama earlier even though
[03:46:34.880 --> 03:46:39.680]  they admit all these people are dying getting sick almost all the people from the exon valdez
[03:46:39.680 --> 03:46:44.000]  are dead they know it's very toxic to have people cleaning this up now that's going to come into
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:50.400]  shore and obama's on tv saying no ill health effects no problems just lying what's the name
[03:46:50.400 --> 03:46:59.920]  of that video tim um i'm not exactly sure but just uh if you google um bill clinton uh giving
[03:46:59.920 --> 03:47:05.840]  interview for bp i'm sure you'll be able to it'll pop up on youtube okay well we'll we'll we'll
[03:47:05.840 --> 03:47:12.000]  try to get it posted thank you tim ron and arizona you're on the air go ahead ron good afternoon
[03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:20.800]  alex and uh patriots they haven't been spraying uh chemtrails in uh petrified arizona area for
[03:47:20.800 --> 03:47:28.960]  over a month and i have no idea very so carol has never committed any act of treason because
[03:47:28.960 --> 03:47:34.880]  he is not an american citizen he is a foreign agent working for the international banksters
[03:47:34.880 --> 03:47:41.680]  but it's still i agree but it's it's espionage and if people get one message it's this globalism
[03:47:41.680 --> 03:47:48.880]  is tyranny it is foreign banking corporate takeovers through fraud it is espionage and so all
[03:47:48.880 --> 03:47:54.880]  these corporate officials that are here in the us conspiring to defraud the taxpayers
[03:47:54.880 --> 03:48:00.720]  are enemy operatives and they need to be seized immediately and given a trial and then they need
[03:48:00.720 --> 03:48:08.640]  to be dealt with go ahead and i agree with you alex i i just i asked you to make that point
[03:48:08.640 --> 03:48:15.600]  clear because he is a foreign agent working for foreign uh banksters who are trying to destroy
[03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:23.120]  this country in the last thing is there's an ancient hebrew saying that goes quote all my people those
[03:48:23.120 --> 03:48:30.000]  who oppress you are children and women rule over you all my people those who guide you lead you
[03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:39.280]  astray and confuse the path and confuse your path uh what we need to do in this country is
[03:48:40.240 --> 03:48:46.640]  get the women out of congress put men back in and quit relying on women to save us because the
[03:48:46.640 --> 03:48:52.960]  bible says that is not going to save us well i appreciate your call i know this there are a
[03:48:52.960 --> 03:48:57.760]  lot of really smart intelligent women there are women smarter than i am a lot smarter
[03:48:57.760 --> 03:49:06.480]  but men and women are different and there has never been a society that has done the things
[03:49:06.480 --> 03:49:10.400]  we're doing that survived and we're going to collapse i mean people don't like to hear it
[03:49:10.400 --> 03:49:17.200]  they don't like to know it but human society is supposed to work a certain way and uh it's
[03:49:17.200 --> 03:49:22.400]  been destroyed and the family's gone no one's secure our women under feminism have been turned
[03:49:22.400 --> 03:49:28.320]  into totally insecure trollops dressed up like whores our children are dying and and on drugs
[03:49:28.320 --> 03:49:33.040]  and and we're destroyed hitler said first you get the women then you got the children so follow
[03:49:33.040 --> 03:49:42.160]  the men it's not that women are bad any more bad than men it's that women want security and women
[03:49:42.160 --> 03:49:52.960]  tend to in history be very trusting of government and they statistically are today and and so over
[03:49:52.960 --> 03:49:58.000]  80 percent of purchases are decided by women what color is the furniture what color of the drapes
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  what brand of milk what brand of eggs i mean the women make the my wife makes almost all the
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:09.520]  decisions i'm here working working on this my wife probably makes 90 percent of the decisions
[03:50:09.520 --> 03:50:13.920]  and if somebody could get control of my wife they'd run my house they would run my life
[03:50:15.280 --> 03:50:20.320]  and that's why hitler said first you got first you get the women you got the children so follow
[03:50:20.320 --> 03:50:25.920]  the men that's an exact quotation and gerbils was obsessed with it first you get the women then
[03:50:25.920 --> 03:50:32.880]  you've got the children so follow the men and they've got the women folks i mean the women support
[03:50:32.880 --> 03:50:38.480]  the cps because they think oh the cps is helping the children oh it's you know meanwhile the cps
[03:50:38.480 --> 03:50:46.080]  is hunting women hunting you know taking their kids it's admitted and today it doesn't mean men
[03:50:46.080 --> 03:50:50.960]  aren't lazy and gullible and dumb it's just that there's a natural order of things and so don't
[03:50:50.960 --> 03:50:56.000]  worry america's going completely down we're all completely screwed and it will be a bunch of people
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:51:01.600]  like andrew napolitano and all those hunchback women they got the supreme court ruling us global
