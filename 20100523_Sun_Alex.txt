[00:00.000 --> 00:08.760]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.760 --> 00:14.560]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14.560 --> 00:19.800]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this 23rd
[00:19.800 --> 00:21.800]  day of May 2010.
[00:21.800 --> 00:27.320]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:27.320 --> 00:30.600]  I want to get into the North Korea situation coming up later.
[00:30.600 --> 00:37.720]  U.S. implicates North Korean leader in torpedo attack New York Times and I wouldn't put it
[00:37.720 --> 00:40.800]  past Kim Jong-il that fits his M.O.
[00:40.800 --> 00:46.080]  But this article out of the Times of London, spy photos reveal secret launch site for Iran's
[00:46.080 --> 00:51.640]  long range missiles just like they claim that Iraq had long range missile sites and was
[00:51.640 --> 00:54.240]  going to attack the United States.
[00:54.240 --> 00:58.920]  Now that logic Israel should be attacked then because they've got intercontinental ballistic
[00:58.920 --> 01:01.440]  missiles and over 400 of them.
[01:01.440 --> 01:06.280]  Of course Iran and Iraq do not have nukes.
[01:06.280 --> 01:10.720]  Our government helped Pakistan get nukes to menace India.
[01:10.720 --> 01:13.960]  The truth is the globalists could care less about real threats to this country.
[01:13.960 --> 01:22.960]  They've got space, space weapons galore up there that are basically a countermeasure,
[01:22.960 --> 01:24.960]  a checkmate to any threat.
[01:24.960 --> 01:31.240]  No, they want to organize limited theater nuclear exchanges but they don't want to go
[01:31.240 --> 01:33.360]  into North Korea.
[01:33.360 --> 01:37.960]  They want to go into Iran so we'll be breaking that down later in the show here.
[01:37.960 --> 01:43.840]  I know that I covered it some Thursday and Jason covered it when he filled in on Friday.
[01:43.840 --> 01:49.040]  The Mexican president Felipe Calderon coming here to the United States and lecturing us
[01:49.040 --> 01:51.040]  on how we need to turn our guns in.
[01:51.040 --> 01:57.160]  But I want to go back into that first when we come back from break and then obviously
[01:57.160 --> 01:59.120]  Rand Paul.
[01:59.120 --> 02:07.120]  Now this isn't just about Rand Paul earlier in the week winning by 30 plus points against
[02:07.120 --> 02:10.160]  the Republican establishment candidate.
[02:10.160 --> 02:12.200]  Now it's more than that.
[02:12.200 --> 02:20.080]  It deals with what racism and tribalism is under the auspices of multiculturalism.
[02:20.080 --> 02:26.240]  All this is is a new religion in this country where if you question anything, the socialist
[02:26.240 --> 02:31.920]  that control our government want, the command and controllers, you are a racist.
[02:31.920 --> 02:34.840]  You don't want government healthcare, you're a racist.
[02:34.840 --> 02:39.240]  You don't like Obama spending more money than all presidents before him combined, you're
[02:39.240 --> 02:41.280]  a racist.
[02:41.280 --> 02:47.800]  And it's just a mindless weapon to be used and so what the politically correct priest
[02:47.800 --> 02:55.240]  are saying is you are not allowed to even have your own opinions or you will be arrested
[02:55.240 --> 02:56.240]  for being a racist.
[02:56.240 --> 02:58.760]  And that's already the case in Europe.
[02:58.760 --> 03:04.520]  And so just like concealed carry owners are no longer concealing them, they are legally
[03:04.520 --> 03:09.560]  and lawfully carrying them openly don't need a permit for that in all but a few global
[03:09.560 --> 03:11.960]  cities like Chicago and New York.
[03:11.960 --> 03:16.400]  And it's making the media report on the fact that why aren't they being arrested?
[03:16.400 --> 03:19.560]  Well because there's no law against this.
[03:19.560 --> 03:25.360]  Gun owners are coming out of the closet and saying there's nothing wrong with us.
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.440]  And to hell with you if you don't like it basically, well it's the same thing with being
[03:31.440 --> 03:36.640]  an American, being against big government, being against socialism, being against open
[03:36.640 --> 03:39.480]  borders, being against the new world order.
[03:39.480 --> 03:40.680]  Let them call you a racist.
[03:40.680 --> 03:41.940]  I don't care.
[03:41.940 --> 03:43.440]  I am done caring.
[03:43.440 --> 03:47.000]  I mean I never really cared because I know what I really stand for.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.480]  But now I'm going to be more overt, more in the establishment's face.
[03:51.480 --> 03:57.120]  Okay, I'm going to wear my colors openly for liberty and freedom and tell it like it is.
[03:57.120 --> 04:06.960]  So that is coming up as well today because the GOP has won their first big race in 20
[04:06.960 --> 04:09.960]  years in Hawaii.
[04:09.960 --> 04:17.200]  We have Andrew Romanoff, the anti-establishment Democrat, trouncing his Democrat competitor
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.400]  in the primary in Colorado.
[04:21.400 --> 04:28.680]  We have Specter, the ultimate insider, the ultimate incumbent out of there in Pennsylvania.
[04:28.680 --> 04:35.560]  But they're trying to blunt this anti-incumbent, anti-globalist revolution with their final
[04:35.560 --> 04:38.200]  weapon, racism.
[04:38.200 --> 04:41.920]  I don't want to turn my guns in.
[04:41.920 --> 04:42.920]  Racist.
[04:42.920 --> 04:44.320]  I don't want government-run healthcare.
[04:44.320 --> 04:45.320]  Racist.
[04:45.320 --> 04:46.320]  We're going bankrupt.
[04:46.320 --> 04:48.280]  I don't think we can have open borders anymore.
[04:48.280 --> 04:49.280]  Racist.
[04:49.280 --> 04:50.280]  It's not going to work.
[04:50.280 --> 04:55.440]  That's why Rand Paul's numbers are only going up since they've been screaming racist.
[04:55.440 --> 04:56.440]  We'll be right back.
[04:56.440 --> 04:57.440]  Stay with us.
[04:57.440 --> 05:01.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[05:01.240 --> 05:05.200]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[05:05.200 --> 05:06.840]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[05:06.840 --> 05:10.880]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[05:10.880 --> 05:11.880]  or gold?
[05:11.880 --> 05:12.880]  It's true.
[05:12.880 --> 05:15.800]  Seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible
[05:15.800 --> 05:17.440]  that could even happen again.
[05:17.440 --> 05:21.600]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[05:21.600 --> 05:22.600]  seeds.
[05:22.600 --> 05:27.920]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[05:27.920 --> 05:29.760]  food for you and your family.
[05:29.760 --> 05:30.880]  And here's the best part.
[05:30.880 --> 05:35.080]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[05:35.080 --> 05:40.840]  to plant a full acre crisis garden, so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[05:40.840 --> 05:47.640]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[05:47.640 --> 05:52.120]  That's 877-327-0365.
[05:52.120 --> 05:56.640]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[05:56.640 --> 06:21.640]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[06:26.640 --> 06:36.080]  Incomements, whether they be Republican or Democrat, are being thrown out of office in
[06:36.080 --> 06:41.840]  primaries all across the United States.
[06:41.840 --> 06:48.440]  And then when you look at the poll numbers, in the case of Arlen Specter, he gets trounced
[06:48.440 --> 06:54.720]  by another Democrat in the primary, and now the Democrat up against the Republican is
[06:54.720 --> 06:57.560]  at least 10 points behind.
[06:57.560 --> 07:03.720]  You've got anti-establishment Republicans running against establishment Republicans,
[07:03.720 --> 07:05.600]  beating them by 30-plus points.
[07:05.600 --> 07:10.640]  In the case of Rand Paul, everywhere incumbents are in trouble.
[07:10.640 --> 07:17.120]  And this is the first time in modern history in the United States, in our 230-plus years,
[07:17.120 --> 07:20.920]  that it's been an anti-incumbency across the board.
[07:20.920 --> 07:27.680]  Normally, what happens is you'll get Democrats in office, and then they sell the people out,
[07:27.680 --> 07:31.360]  so the population gets mad and puts in Republicans.
[07:31.360 --> 07:36.360]  And then a few years later, the Republicans don't do what they said they do, and the public
[07:36.360 --> 07:38.480]  then votes Democrats back in.
[07:38.480 --> 07:43.120]  And on and on and on, the fraud goes on.
[07:43.120 --> 07:47.120]  And it's taken the American people about 100 years to figure out that private corporate
[07:47.120 --> 07:52.960]  offshore interests have bought off the leadership of both parties.
[07:52.960 --> 07:58.120]  There were some real elections previous to 100 years ago, and a few examples where we
[07:58.120 --> 08:00.600]  had real elections in the last 100 years.
[08:00.600 --> 08:05.400]  But by and large, the robber barons that created the monopoly over banking, the monopoly over
[08:05.400 --> 08:13.720]  the railroads, the monopoly over the delivery of farm goods from the countryside to the city,
[08:13.720 --> 08:20.400]  they were able to build a centralized control system and consolidate their power.
[08:20.400 --> 08:27.960]  And the last 100 years, really about 110 now, but since about 1900, we have seen a continued
[08:27.960 --> 08:33.320]  consolidation of undemocratic, un-American power.
[08:33.320 --> 08:39.560]  As John D. Rockefeller I said, competition is a sin, monopolies made my family, and
[08:39.560 --> 08:42.040]  they'll make our world government empire.
[08:42.040 --> 08:47.800]  And they'll read those quotes by him, yes, over 90 years ago calling for a world government
[08:47.800 --> 08:50.040]  private corporate empire.
[08:50.040 --> 08:54.920]  And they funded the UN, they funded the club of Rome, they funded all the major environmental
[08:54.920 --> 09:01.000]  organizations to destroy property rights, they run almost everything with the Dutch role
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.440]  family and the British role family and the Rothschilds.
[09:06.440 --> 09:09.260]  And they openly brag about it.
[09:09.260 --> 09:19.400]  So the incredible news here today is that for the first time in 100 plus years, there
[09:19.400 --> 09:25.160]  has been a true populist realignment in the nation.
[09:25.160 --> 09:30.400]  Remember how it took in poll numbers six years or two years into his second term, halfway
[09:30.400 --> 09:37.320]  into his second term for George W. Bush to go from a high approval rating down to the
[09:37.320 --> 09:44.360]  low 40s and then to the mid 30s and then to the low 20s by the time he left office.
[09:44.360 --> 09:49.080]  It took six years for people to wake up to the fact that he was not a conservative, he
[09:49.080 --> 09:55.560]  was not a patriot, that he was just a puppet who couldn't even read off a teleprompter.
[09:55.560 --> 10:02.320]  Now it took about eight months for Obama to go from a 80 plus percent approval rating
[10:02.320 --> 10:07.360]  to a low 40 and now in many polls below a 40.
[10:07.360 --> 10:12.480]  It took eight months for him to go from an 80 plus, some polls were 87, some 82, but
[10:12.480 --> 10:17.240]  above 80, down to a low 40 or below 40.
[10:17.240 --> 10:21.480]  Now he's falling even faster, lowest approval rating in U.S. history for any president this
[10:21.480 --> 10:24.000]  far into their administration, okay?
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.080]  So it took less than a year for them to wake up to Obama, it took six years to wake up
[10:29.080 --> 10:35.560]  to Bush and when they put a Republican fake savior in in two and a half years, three years,
[10:35.560 --> 10:39.480]  it will take weeks to wake up to him.
[10:39.480 --> 10:43.360]  Do you understand that or her?
[10:43.360 --> 10:45.320]  People have figured out their bird cage liner.
[10:45.320 --> 10:49.560]  Instead of talking about what the bird cage liner Barack Obama's doing, real name Barry
[10:49.560 --> 10:55.440]  Sotaro or what George W. Bush is doing with his fake Texas accent from Kenny Bunkport,
[10:55.440 --> 11:01.160]  instead of it taking years, it takes months now.
[11:01.160 --> 11:04.680]  Instead of looking at what's on the bird cage liner, we look at the bird, the New World
[11:04.680 --> 11:12.840]  Order, the offshore corporations that are doing, you know what, all over us as a society.
[11:12.840 --> 11:16.480]  And that's why it's the Big New Brzezinski Panic last week.
[11:16.480 --> 11:21.480]  We wrote stories about it up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com with the video, in fact
[11:21.480 --> 11:26.360]  I forget the exact headline with you, I think it's the Big New Brzezinski says afraid of
[11:26.360 --> 11:31.280]  global awakening and he said, our world government is in trouble, you can go watch the video.
[11:31.280 --> 11:37.480]  This is the top globalist advisor living, who's actually calling shots for the big families.
[11:37.480 --> 11:42.360]  I mean, he's the conciliary for the New World Order, bigger than Kissinger, the top advisor
[11:42.360 --> 11:48.640]  to Obama on all geopolitical operations and he's at the CFR and he on TV and he says,
[11:48.640 --> 11:53.200]  our world government's in trouble, for the first time, the world is awake to our world
[11:53.200 --> 11:55.000]  government.
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.080]  See now, they don't have to sit there arrogantly and deny there's a world government anymore
[11:59.080 --> 12:01.200]  because they now know you're awake.
[12:01.200 --> 12:03.200]  So he sits up there and says, what are we going to do?
[12:03.200 --> 12:05.040]  Well, they're going to start a war.
[12:05.040 --> 12:08.320]  They're going to start a World War III is what they're going to do, to teach you to
[12:08.320 --> 12:12.080]  do what they say, to teach you to give up your pension funds, because this is the key
[12:12.080 --> 12:14.640]  I want to lay out here for you.
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.760]  All you out there, laugh at tyranny and laugh at corruption, say, how does it affect me?
[12:18.760 --> 12:24.360]  It affects you because 100% of the time, when you get a corrupt despotic system in control,
[12:24.360 --> 12:30.000]  it takes your pension funds and devalues your currency, 100% of the time, this is going
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.520]  to hurt you.
[12:32.520 --> 12:38.200]  It's the equivalent of somebody who works in an asbestos factory, you know, back in
[12:38.200 --> 12:40.200]  the 40s for 10 years.
[12:40.200 --> 12:44.800]  It may not kill you next year, but in the next five to 10 years, statistically, you're
[12:44.800 --> 12:45.800]  dead.
[12:45.800 --> 12:47.800]  You're going to die of emphysema or cancer.
[12:47.800 --> 12:48.800]  You're dead.
[12:48.800 --> 12:49.800]  Okay.
[12:49.800 --> 12:50.800]  The country is dead.
[12:50.800 --> 12:51.800]  It's dead already.
[12:51.800 --> 12:52.800]  We bled out.
[12:52.800 --> 12:53.800]  It's over.
[12:53.800 --> 12:57.320]  They savaged the hell out of us and you just now woke up to it when it's too late.
[12:57.320 --> 13:01.200]  Now we can do some things, salvage some things and rebuild.
[13:01.200 --> 13:04.160]  The engine of liberty is unstoppable.
[13:04.160 --> 13:09.920]  We can raise this sucker from the dead, but you've got to admit it's dead first before
[13:09.920 --> 13:14.520]  there's any hope of resurrection of the Republic or freedom worldwide.
[13:14.520 --> 13:15.520]  Okay.
[13:15.520 --> 13:21.280]  You've got to admit death by a thousand cuts, 1.5 quadrillion and the economists we have
[13:21.280 --> 13:28.560]  on debate, whether it's 500 trillion or 1,500 trillion, but it's well over 500 trillion.
[13:28.560 --> 13:34.320]  Some estimates are 1.5 quadrillion of fake made up derivatives by the counterfeiting
[13:34.320 --> 13:40.160]  central banks as a economic weapon to totally take over society.
[13:40.160 --> 13:46.160]  Now that is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, conservatively, some estimates are thousands,
[13:46.160 --> 13:49.560]  of times more wealth than there really is in the world.
[13:49.560 --> 13:54.120]  That'd be like a Bernie Mane office that'll make up 200 billion in fake money if he made
[13:54.120 --> 13:58.760]  up gulag or Google or infinity.
[13:58.760 --> 14:04.040]  Yeah, Google's a word, gulags a word, not just a place in Russia where they keep you
[14:04.040 --> 14:05.040]  in a camp.
[14:05.040 --> 14:10.520]  It's a thousands of zeros or something with a one in front of it.
[14:10.520 --> 14:15.200]  The point is, once you're making tens of trillions of made up currency up, why not go to the
[14:15.200 --> 14:16.800]  limit?
[14:16.800 --> 14:18.840]  So we're dead already.
[14:18.840 --> 14:23.520]  It's like Star Trek, Wrath of Khan, when Shatner goes down and they keep him from going
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.280]  into the radiation chamber and they explain, he's dead already.
[14:27.280 --> 14:29.280]  It's dead already.
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.080]  And don't worry, for you the uppies out there that are self-hating, it's probably going
[14:33.080 --> 14:35.080]  to completely collapse.
[14:35.080 --> 14:36.720]  We probably won't be able to fix it.
[14:36.720 --> 14:41.360]  So you'll get to have your way and be a little socialist and your kids can wear black uniforms
[14:41.360 --> 14:45.240]  and rob all of us that produced and you'll have all your petty power.
[14:45.240 --> 14:51.880]  But for most of you out there, just continue enjoying your football and your baseball and
[14:51.880 --> 14:59.320]  laughing at people like me because, you know, this is what you want, this is what you get.
[14:59.320 --> 15:02.840]  But I mean, to be more serious, folks, we can avert this.
[15:02.840 --> 15:11.680]  We can reverse this if you get really hardcore serious and awake and angry and upset, okay?
[15:11.680 --> 15:15.240]  Like they're doing in Greece, like they're doing in Iceland, many other nations.
[15:15.240 --> 15:16.680]  The bankers are in trouble.
[15:16.680 --> 15:18.180]  They are not invincible.
[15:18.180 --> 15:24.480]  But when we come back, I want to first get into Felipe Calderon coming here to the U.S.
[15:24.480 --> 15:26.400]  and lecturing us.
[15:26.400 --> 15:31.400]  No one else would put up with this, but people in the U.S. we are just such weak, slack,
[15:31.400 --> 15:35.760]  flawed, broke back, politically correct, chicken necks.
[15:35.760 --> 15:37.960]  We put up with any amount of humiliation.
[15:37.960 --> 15:39.720]  We see it as a virtue.
[15:39.720 --> 15:46.520]  We've been trained to be cowardly and domesticated and it's time to wake up again and realize
[15:46.520 --> 15:50.600]  that if they get our guns, our journey to slavery is complete.
[15:50.600 --> 15:55.080]  So we're going to break down Felipe Calderon demanding that we turn our guns in.
[15:55.080 --> 16:00.880]  Then we're going to get into the political realignment that's happened and a lot more.
[16:00.880 --> 16:01.880]  Hello friends.
[16:01.880 --> 16:02.880]  This is Alex Jones.
[16:02.880 --> 16:05.840]  You've heard me talk about Calvin 5 Star Soaps for years.
[16:05.840 --> 16:10.120]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find
[16:10.120 --> 16:11.120]  in stores.

[16:24.800 --> 16:29.800]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and
[16:29.800 --> 16:31.240]  gentle on the environment.

[16:59.000 --> 17:00.000]  Thank you.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.840]  They helped to create a new world order.
[17:02.840 --> 17:05.000]  We are part of a new world order.
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.800]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[17:08.800 --> 17:12.520]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[17:12.520 --> 17:13.520]  documents.
[17:13.520 --> 17:17.960]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[17:17.960 --> 17:20.440]  It means all the world under their control.
[17:20.440 --> 17:23.200]  The United Nations would take over America.
[17:23.200 --> 17:26.520]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[17:26.520 --> 17:31.460]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[17:31.460 --> 17:33.960]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[17:33.960 --> 17:38.440]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[17:38.440 --> 17:39.440]  financial system.
[17:39.440 --> 17:42.320]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[17:42.320 --> 17:46.040]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[17:46.040 --> 17:48.840]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[17:48.840 --> 17:54.880]  Invisible Empire, secure your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or watch
[17:54.880 --> 17:58.400]  it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[18:25.240 --> 18:26.760]  Will it make your children sick?
[18:26.760 --> 18:30.900]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[18:30.900 --> 18:32.060]  and be immunized?
[18:32.060 --> 18:35.840]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[18:35.840 --> 18:39.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[18:39.440 --> 18:40.680]  How much will you need?
[18:40.680 --> 18:41.680]  We don't know.
[18:41.680 --> 18:42.680]  How much do you want?
[18:42.680 --> 18:43.680]  All you can get.
[18:43.680 --> 18:44.680]  I'm Alex Jones.
[18:44.680 --> 18:52.360]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[18:52.360 --> 19:00.160]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[19:00.160 --> 19:04.920]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[19:04.920 --> 19:08.480]  What have we got, a republic or a monarchy?
[19:08.480 --> 19:12.360]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[19:12.360 --> 19:16.560]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.240]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[19:21.240 --> 19:22.240]  our money.
[19:22.240 --> 19:26.320]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[19:26.320 --> 19:29.840]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[19:29.840 --> 19:31.080]  You'll have to be more than that.
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.800]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common
[19:34.800 --> 19:35.800]  law.
[19:35.800 --> 19:39.360]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you
[19:39.360 --> 19:43.840]  Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping
[19:43.840 --> 19:46.280]  giant that is the American people is rising.
[19:46.280 --> 19:49.080]  A new tool in the Info War, Don't Tread on Me.

[20:05.280 --> 20:09.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:09.280 --> 20:28.360]  Okay, my friends, thanks for joining us again on this live Sunday, the 23rd day of May 2010.
[20:28.360 --> 20:33.880]  Coming up, the national campaign to demonize Rand Paul, the disinformation behind that
[20:33.880 --> 20:40.320]  and why it's going to blow up in the controller's pathetic faces, but first I want to get into
[20:40.320 --> 20:42.360]  Felipe Calderon.
[20:42.360 --> 20:49.320]  Now, if you go back to the time he was elected, what, three years ago, clearly he wasn't elected.
[20:49.320 --> 20:54.160]  He's a globalist stooge, and at the time we predicted that there was going to be a giant
[20:54.160 --> 21:01.480]  war breaking out in Mexico and that the already horrible drug violence was going to accelerate
[21:01.480 --> 21:08.560]  because our inside sources like Cellicastello and others, DEA agents, said that Los Zetas
[21:08.560 --> 21:15.360]  was actually a paramilitary front for the Mexican military and the U.S. and the CIA,
[21:15.360 --> 21:20.400]  and that it was going to be waging war against cartels that weren't laundering their money
[21:20.400 --> 21:21.400]  through U.S. banks.
[21:21.400 --> 21:28.960]  And of course, now it's even on the news that CIA aircraft crash in Mexico with 3,000 tons
[21:28.960 --> 21:34.320]  of pure cocaine coming from the source, and our troops are told, grow the poppies in Afghanistan.
[21:34.320 --> 21:38.160]  They put it on the news and explain, well, we're growing it and shipping it out, but
[21:38.160 --> 21:40.360]  if we catch you with it, you're still going to jail.
[21:40.360 --> 21:45.560]  Well, yeah, because our government deals the drugs and the banks make the money, and they've
[21:45.560 --> 21:53.120]  got to keep it illegal to keep the price up, so it's very simple, but side issue, Felipe
[21:53.120 --> 21:59.920]  Calderón is a complete thug, and his government is just filled with narcotics traffickers,
[21:59.920 --> 22:02.840]  they're constantly ratting each other out.
[22:02.840 --> 22:06.840]  And most of the weapons being used, and I've seen this in State Department reports, have
[22:06.840 --> 22:12.280]  grenade launchers, they're German military weapons, they're U.S. military weapons that
[22:12.280 --> 22:20.520]  are sold to Mexico as the multi-billion-dollar aid packages, and then the Mexican military
[22:20.520 --> 22:26.080]  sells it to even the rival drug cartels to make money.
[22:26.080 --> 22:30.520]  And then some of the Mexican people are buying shotguns, are buying handguns in the U.S.,
[22:30.520 --> 22:35.040]  they're not allowed to own guns in Mexico, that's why they're slaves, to defend themselves,
[22:35.040 --> 22:37.000]  and Felipe Calderón doesn't like this.
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.880]  Look, these people are his property, okay, I mean, you try to protest the government
[22:41.880 --> 22:45.520]  in Mexico, they just pull up with machine guns and mow you down, the police were wearing
[22:45.520 --> 22:50.480]  a ski mask there 50 years ago, we're just now becoming slaves here, and he got up before
[22:50.480 --> 22:57.200]  the Congress and he said, look, if you allow these guns to be sold in Mexico, criminals
[22:57.200 --> 23:01.960]  may even challenge your government, and that's a threat, he'll just have some Mexican drug
[23:01.960 --> 23:04.840]  gangs already killing cops, kill more.
[23:04.840 --> 23:09.640]  But so most of the guns going to Mexico are not from the U.S. or from gun shops or gun
[23:09.640 --> 23:14.800]  shows, but this is their new reason to want to ban all semi-automatic handguns and rifles
[23:14.800 --> 23:20.160]  in the U.S. and to ban gun shows, and the attorney general's been pushing it, by the
[23:20.160 --> 23:27.120]  way, argued two years ago in federal court that he's for a complete gun ban of U.S. citizens.
[23:27.120 --> 23:30.600]  And that's the problem with these illegal aliens, when they become citizens over 90%
[23:30.600 --> 23:35.880]  of the time in polls, they vote to take guns, they vote to be slaves again, oh please, don't
[23:35.880 --> 23:41.080]  let me own a gun, take my gun, so that's another reason we've got to be against these open
[23:41.080 --> 23:47.760]  borders, but imagine a U.S. president going down to Mexico and telling them what to do.
[23:47.760 --> 23:51.400]  And that's why Congressman McDermott and others pointed out, this violates all the decorum
[23:51.400 --> 23:58.880]  of the house, no one ever does this, no foreign leader has ever come and told us what legislation
[23:58.880 --> 24:05.040]  to pass, but it's all part of humiliating the U.S., all part of training the American
[24:05.040 --> 24:07.840]  people to put up with all forms of humiliation.
[24:07.840 --> 24:12.120]  Obama is the head of the U.N. Security Council, in violation of Article 1, Section 9 of the
[24:12.120 --> 24:19.800]  Constitution, it's a felony, he still is, a U.N. official, the head of the U.N. It's
[24:19.800 --> 24:24.160]  all part of throwing it in our face, setting the precedent, yeah, we're going to take
[24:24.160 --> 24:27.600]  your blood without warrants at checkpoints, yeah, we're going to take all babies' blood
[24:27.600 --> 24:32.080]  at birth and put it in a Pentagon database, yeah, we're going to take your pension funds,
[24:32.080 --> 24:35.480]  yeah, we're going to steal tens of trillions of dollars and not tell Congress where the
[24:35.480 --> 24:41.680]  money went when people ask in the Congress of Tim Geithner and others, Treasury Secretary,
[24:41.680 --> 24:46.240]  it's all about humiliating us and letting us know we're pathetic slaves, and so they
[24:46.240 --> 24:52.160]  have this kingpin, this L. Heffey, this mob boss, Calderon, comes to the United States
[24:52.160 --> 24:56.840]  and gets standing ovations when he calls for banning most types of firearms.
[24:56.840 --> 24:59.920]  All semi-automatic are, quote, assault weapons.
[24:59.920 --> 25:05.440]  Now remember, Mexico has the highest crime rate in the world according to the State Department,
[25:05.440 --> 25:08.760]  23,000 deaths and counting in the last two years.
[25:08.760 --> 25:14.840]  There's kidnappings of U.S. citizens, attacks on the U.S. Embassy, even resort areas are
[25:14.840 --> 25:18.880]  imploding to crime and murder like Cancun, nowhere is safe there.
[25:18.880 --> 25:21.200]  You couldn't travel somewhere more dangerous.
[25:21.200 --> 25:24.880]  You might as well go to the West Bank of Israel of Palestine, it's safer.
[25:24.880 --> 25:28.640]  I mean, there's nowhere more dangerous, but you notice the colleges tell the college kids
[25:28.640 --> 25:32.240]  go there and everybody tells you get a trip down there and go down there so you can be
[25:32.240 --> 25:36.000]  shaken down by the Mexican troops, she can be kidnapped, she can be murdered, she can
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  be raped.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.920]  It's so much fun to be kidnapped and killed, it's so much fun.
[25:39.920 --> 25:42.880]  It's more dangerous than Brazil in kidnapping now.
[25:42.880 --> 25:47.400]  It's more dangerous than Costa Rica or Argentina or any of these countries, by the way Costa
[25:47.400 --> 25:51.040]  Rica isn't safe anymore, they'll lie to you and tell you that.
[25:51.040 --> 25:55.840]  It's worse than Bolivia, it's worse than Honduras, these are really bad countries now I'm naming.
[25:55.840 --> 25:57.400]  Costa Rica's pretty good comparatively.
[25:57.400 --> 26:02.680]  It's worse than, what's one of the most horrible with the shining path, Peru.
[26:02.680 --> 26:09.760]  I mean, we've got a real toilet south of us, this thing is completely collapsed.
[26:09.760 --> 26:13.760]  The government makes people in the Justice Department take implantable microchips to
[26:13.760 --> 26:15.880]  get in the building.
[26:15.880 --> 26:19.640]  Mexico makes you register with thumb prints to get a cell phone.
[26:19.640 --> 26:24.680]  Total police state, collapsing completely, thanks to NAFTA and GATT.
[26:24.680 --> 26:28.880]  Oh yeah, it's been worse for Mexico than even for the US, but good for the globalist.
[26:28.880 --> 26:35.160]  So it's totally collapsing now and meanwhile Chicago and New York have exploding crime
[26:35.160 --> 26:41.040]  rates and Mayor Daley, the son of the most famous mob boss in US history, said comments
[26:41.040 --> 26:43.480]  at a press conference that I can't even repeat.
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.640]  Somebody pointed out, sir, you have the most draconian gun laws in the country and you
[26:47.640 --> 26:52.240]  have the highest crime rate, criminals move here because they're safe and he said, I ought
[26:52.240 --> 26:57.440]  to shove a gun up your, you know what, and basically blow you away, just a total big
[26:57.440 --> 26:58.440]  fat mobster.
[26:58.440 --> 27:03.920]  Oh, you got a problem, I owns you, you understand that I own you and your family, I'll shove
[27:03.920 --> 27:07.400]  a gun in you, you know what, we can play the clip.
[27:07.400 --> 27:12.280]  That's what Calderon is, that's what Daley is, that's what Bloomberg is, it's big fat
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.320]  mobsters sucking your blood, sucking your taxes.
[27:16.320 --> 27:20.200]  You want to be a third world country, you want to have your pension funds taken, you
[27:20.200 --> 27:25.880]  want to have everything devalued, it's going to happen to you, all you scumbag, weak, disgusting
[27:25.880 --> 27:30.320]  yuppies that suck your thumb for a living and are dumber than a box of rocks and are
[27:30.320 --> 27:34.920]  so politically correct, you'll never get up and stand up and speak out for anything
[27:34.920 --> 27:39.200]  and all you politically correct scum out there that love seeing America fall and love
[27:39.200 --> 27:43.280]  all the tyranny and love seeing this country become bankrupt, oh, you think you're going
[27:43.280 --> 27:48.000]  to get all your little reconquista and your infosora and your socialism, no, it'll be
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.200]  a big toilet, it'll be a big giant toilet like Eastern Europe, it'll be a big giant
[27:53.200 --> 27:58.760]  filthy toilet just like Mexico City, you like it, well that's what you get, you like it,
[27:58.760 --> 28:03.200]  you get it, all of you are going to get it, police and black ski mask everywhere, military
[28:03.200 --> 28:09.160]  checkpoints, total scum, filth, all of the slaves, control freaks everywhere, ruling,
[28:09.160 --> 28:13.320]  having their way with us, you're going to get it, all of you decadent football idiots
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.800]  who only care about football, all of you out there that love to lay down to corruption
[28:17.800 --> 28:21.920]  and to think everything is cute and funny and love to make fun of me all day and attack
[28:21.920 --> 28:27.000]  this radio show because I'm red blooded and I know what's going on, you're going to get
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.160]  everything you want, I want you to listen carefully, in the next two years they're going
[28:32.160 --> 28:36.480]  to devalue your currency by at least 50%, you're so stupid when the government tells
[28:36.480 --> 28:40.800]  you it's not devalued, you still won't know it's devalued because they told you so and
[28:40.800 --> 28:44.560]  as you lose your standard of living, you'll just stick your thumb in your mouth and suck
[28:44.560 --> 28:49.480]  it and watch television and then ask the government to come with diapers and change your diaper
[28:49.480 --> 28:53.240]  and the government will come lovingly and slit your throat and you'll thank them because
[28:53.240 --> 28:56.960]  that's what you do is bow down to corruption because your forefathers are rolling in their
[28:56.960 --> 29:26.920]  graves with hatred of you because you're trash.
[29:56.960 --> 30:06.440]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid
[30:06.440 --> 30:10.320]  losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[30:10.320 --> 30:16.360]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting
[30:16.360 --> 30:21.200]  in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[30:21.200 --> 30:25.920]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and
[30:25.920 --> 30:27.240]  our families.
[30:27.240 --> 30:31.080]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your
[30:31.080 --> 30:32.400]  own home.
[30:32.400 --> 30:37.000]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.160]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[30:41.160 --> 30:48.160]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by
[30:48.160 --> 30:51.360]  producing your own colloidal silver right from home.
[30:51.360 --> 30:58.360]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[30:58.360 --> 31:01.840]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[31:01.840 --> 31:05.800]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[31:05.800 --> 31:07.440]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[31:07.440 --> 31:11.480]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[31:11.480 --> 31:12.480]  or gold?
[31:12.480 --> 31:15.840]  It's true, seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[31:15.840 --> 31:18.000]  possible that could even happen again.
[31:18.000 --> 31:22.440]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[31:22.440 --> 31:23.440]  seeds.
[31:23.440 --> 31:28.480]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[31:28.480 --> 31:30.360]  food for you and your family.
[31:30.360 --> 31:31.480]  And here's the best part.
[31:31.480 --> 31:35.680]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[31:35.680 --> 31:38.160]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[31:38.160 --> 31:41.400]  So visit them today at www.survivalseedbank.com.
[31:41.400 --> 31:48.200]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[31:48.200 --> 31:52.360]  That's 877-327-0365.
[31:52.360 --> 31:57.200]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[31:57.200 --> 31:59.520]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[31:59.520 --> 32:07.400]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[32:07.400 --> 32:12.400]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[32:12.400 --> 32:21.160]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[32:21.160 --> 32:28.280]  They soak right in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[32:28.280 --> 32:34.400]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[32:34.400 --> 32:39.320]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[32:39.320 --> 32:46.120]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[32:46.120 --> 32:50.680]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[32:50.680 --> 32:52.840]  ride all day with confidence.
[32:52.840 --> 32:55.760]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[32:55.760 --> 33:01.680]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[33:01.680 --> 33:05.400]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:05.400 --> 33:14.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:14.400 --> 33:19.640]  Have you noticed the people that want your guns, also want to build more prisons and
[33:19.640 --> 33:24.440]  get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and have DNA databases for all and strip you
[33:24.440 --> 33:27.000]  of your liberties, both Republican and Democrat?
[33:27.000 --> 33:33.200]  They have legislation in the Senate, the belligerence act that states the Pentagon can secretly
[33:33.200 --> 33:38.640]  arrest U.S. citizens and secretly strip you of your rights anytime they want, that you
[33:38.640 --> 33:39.640]  can be tortured.
[33:39.640 --> 33:44.000]  Oh, yeah, that's in the bill, enhanced interrogation.
[33:44.000 --> 33:49.720]  Oh, but you don't hear the media crying and screaming, oh my gosh, like they are about
[33:49.720 --> 33:52.720]  Arizona, and I've read the Arizona bill.
[33:52.720 --> 33:57.440]  That's why Janet Napolitano in congressional hearings last week said I haven't read it.
[33:57.440 --> 34:01.680]  Well, of course she hadn't read it because if she said she'd read it, which she obviously
[34:01.680 --> 34:05.800]  has, she'd know it says if the cops pull you over drunk driving or pull you over for
[34:05.800 --> 34:11.080]  something else or at the scene of a crime and ask for ID and you don't have one and
[34:11.080 --> 34:13.160]  you're an illegal, they're going to arrest you.
[34:13.160 --> 34:15.680]  That's what the stinkin' thing says.
[34:15.680 --> 34:19.280]  But nope, police, you already know this, you were arrest illegals, you're told to release
[34:19.280 --> 34:22.440]  them, drunk driving, you name it, 800 plus sanctuary cities.
[34:22.440 --> 34:23.560]  It's on record.
[34:23.560 --> 34:28.760]  You're only allowed to go after the American people and when it comes to us, shoot us in
[34:28.760 --> 34:33.800]  the back, rob us, take everything we got, throw the book at us.
[34:33.800 --> 34:39.000]  We are scum, no matter what color we are, we are the cattle to be sucked dry.
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.960]  And the globalists just want foreigners in here to pull the lever to take our guns and
[34:43.960 --> 34:45.520]  to vote for socialism.
[34:45.520 --> 34:48.840]  And once they've totally brought the country down, don't worry, police, you're going to
[34:48.840 --> 34:50.880]  get to have your way with the illegals.
[34:50.880 --> 34:54.160]  Once they're legal, you're going to get to suck them dry as well.
[34:54.160 --> 34:58.600]  There's going to be a lot of societal raping going on.
[34:58.600 --> 35:03.840]  You want enjoyment, you want domination, you want control, you want a sadist buffet of
[35:03.840 --> 35:06.760]  enjoyment, you have got it.
[35:06.760 --> 35:09.440]  Don't you worry, it's just going to get better and better for tyranny.
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.760]  Now, if you're a good cop, you're going to be kicked off the force.
[35:13.760 --> 35:18.720]  It's all part of tyranny, oh, hundreds and hundreds of other countries have fallen to
[35:18.720 --> 35:19.720]  it.
[35:19.720 --> 35:23.360]  Now, in America, we do it bigger and better.
[35:23.360 --> 35:28.840]  So congressman slams the outrage of Calderon lecture on immigration, that's a prisonplanet.com
[35:28.840 --> 35:29.840]  article.
[35:29.840 --> 35:32.360]  We have the video of McClintock up there laying it all out.
[35:32.360 --> 35:33.840]  In fact, get that cued up too.
[35:33.840 --> 35:35.600]  He says it so well, I'm going to play it.
[35:35.600 --> 35:37.160]  Calls next hour.
[35:37.160 --> 35:43.800]  But first, let's play Felipe Calderon, the unelected fraud.
[35:43.800 --> 35:45.680]  It's on record.
[35:45.680 --> 35:48.360]  They stole elections nationwide, riots all over Mexico.
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.040]  The people are trying to stand up for liberty down there, but their government is, well,
[35:52.040 --> 35:55.920]  they got triple the resources we got here in the U.S., more billionaires than we have
[35:55.920 --> 35:58.520]  in the U.S. and they're one of the poorest countries in the world.
[35:58.520 --> 36:02.400]  I mean, you talk about slavery, that's what Mexico has, is slavery.
[36:02.400 --> 36:08.160]  Oh, you're not called a slave, you just are a slave.
[36:08.160 --> 36:15.040]  And folks, I was out of Mexico two years ago, even in Yucatan, it's checkpoints every
[36:15.040 --> 36:22.840]  two miles with the bus driver with a big chartered bus going out to the pyramids.
[36:22.840 --> 36:24.120]  I've never seen this before in Mexico.
[36:24.120 --> 36:29.680]  I've seen them do it to gringos and scum, slaves, you know, they're coming in there
[36:29.680 --> 36:35.840]  to be sucked off of, you know, give me some money or I'm going to take you to prison.
[36:35.840 --> 36:37.520]  But again, that's sweet and loving.
[36:37.520 --> 36:39.160]  You'll never hear the State Department complain about that.
[36:39.160 --> 36:40.840]  It's, oh, it's so sweet.
[36:40.840 --> 36:41.840]  Oh, good.
[36:41.840 --> 36:42.840]  Oh, loving.
[36:42.840 --> 36:46.800]  But I watched the bus driver have to pay the Mexican troops off.
[36:46.800 --> 36:51.800]  So now even the big tours are sucked on by the military, but don't worry, we're getting
[36:51.800 --> 36:52.800]  like that here too.
[36:52.800 --> 36:55.040]  It's a whole part of freedom.
[36:55.040 --> 36:57.640]  In every third world country, you got troops on the streets, well, we got them here in
[36:57.640 --> 37:00.520]  America now and they're going to be running our lives.
[37:00.520 --> 37:04.840]  But again, I'm digressing how dare me be against troops all over the street.
[37:04.840 --> 37:08.240]  It's a great thing to pay off the military.
[37:08.240 --> 37:09.920]  That's good.
[37:09.920 --> 37:16.200]  But here's Felipe Calderón telling us what we've got to do.
[37:16.200 --> 37:22.080]  Telling us how we've got to behave and what legislation we've got to pass and lying and
[37:22.080 --> 37:27.520]  saying that our guns sold here in America are the ones flooding Mexico.
[37:27.520 --> 37:32.480]  When he knows full well, he's down there running a giant war against cartels that aren't laundering
[37:32.480 --> 37:34.800]  their money through big U.S. banks.
[37:34.800 --> 37:37.160]  Now, here it is.
[37:37.160 --> 37:47.440]  But believe me, many of these guns are not going to honest American hands.
[37:47.440 --> 37:52.200]  Instead, thousands are ending up in the hands of criminals.
[37:52.200 --> 37:55.360]  We all do respect.
[37:55.360 --> 38:00.840]  You do not regulate the sale of these weapons in the right way.
[38:00.840 --> 38:06.920]  Nothing guarantees that criminals here in the United States with access to the same power
[38:06.920 --> 38:14.440]  of weapons will not decide to challenge American authorities and civilians.
[38:14.440 --> 38:23.280]  But I will ask Congress to help us with respect and to understand how important it is for
[38:23.280 --> 38:30.400]  us that you enforce current laws to stem the supply of these weapons to criminals and
[38:30.400 --> 38:33.800]  consider restating the assault weapons ban.
[38:33.800 --> 38:35.800]  Oh, they clap.
[38:35.800 --> 38:38.040]  Let's get this straight.
[38:38.040 --> 38:42.360]  There are 35 to 40 million illegals here, another million or two a year, a million
[38:42.360 --> 38:43.360]  legals.
[38:43.360 --> 38:47.200]  It's almost all from Latin America and Mexico pouring in.
[38:47.200 --> 38:49.640]  They export the criminal element.
[38:49.640 --> 38:51.920]  They come here to have the baby for free.
[38:51.920 --> 38:54.160]  Everybody gets on welfare.
[38:54.160 --> 38:56.200]  All the police basically leave you alone.
[38:56.200 --> 38:57.200]  You're above the law.
[38:57.200 --> 38:58.360]  Isn't this great?
[38:58.360 --> 39:00.480]  The whole Southwest is going bankrupt.
[39:00.480 --> 39:03.880]  They're not paving roads in California.
[39:03.880 --> 39:05.080]  It's completely collapsing.
[39:05.080 --> 39:07.640]  I'm talking to friends and family out there.
[39:07.640 --> 39:09.160]  It's just completely collapsing.
[39:09.160 --> 39:10.320]  Everything's falling apart.
[39:10.320 --> 39:14.240]  They're laying off half the police in major cities or more.
[39:14.240 --> 39:18.960]  But meanwhile, we've got to stem the flow of guns down there to his country where people
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.320]  are disarmed so the criminal gangs can have their way just like in Chicago and New York.
[39:24.320 --> 39:31.120]  Everywhere you have thugs like Bloomberg or Daily in Chicago or Kolarone, their answer
[39:31.120 --> 39:37.080]  to the crime their corrupt system creates is that we need to turn our guns in so we
[39:37.080 --> 39:42.360]  can live like the poor people who are under tyranny live in Mexico.
[39:42.360 --> 39:46.240]  I'll guarantee you, if we'd have made those 35 million illegal aliens stay in Mexico,
[39:46.240 --> 39:47.680]  they would have overthrown that government.
[39:47.680 --> 39:49.000]  We have something better down there.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.560]  But our stinking globalist government, the same globalists that are destroying America,
[39:52.560 --> 39:57.120]  that run America, they run Mexico and they brag about it, how they keep the people poor
[39:57.120 --> 40:01.800]  by design so that they have no way of ever standing up.
[40:01.800 --> 40:06.400]  The elite don't want a middle class and people in the United States are about to find that
[40:06.400 --> 40:07.400]  out.
[40:07.400 --> 40:11.600]  Now, here was Barack Obama the day before at the White House with Kolarone saying, our
[40:11.600 --> 40:14.840]  nation isn't defined by its borders.
[40:14.840 --> 40:16.000]  Pure New World Order.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.120]  This is pure globalization, pure world government.
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.520]  Okay, this is the North American Union that I heard some yuppies on the radio making fun
[40:24.520 --> 40:28.080]  of me last week saying there's no such thing as an N.A.U.
[40:28.080 --> 40:32.880]  Doesn't matter if it's all public, it's just, they're like children.
[40:32.880 --> 40:36.280]  They just don't understand how real this is.
[40:36.280 --> 40:37.280]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[40:37.280 --> 40:38.280]  Here it is.
[40:38.280 --> 40:43.260]  In the 21st century, we are defined not by our borders, but by our bonds.
[40:43.260 --> 40:47.680]  So I say to you and to the Mexican people, let us stand together.
[40:47.680 --> 40:49.720]  This is all about the North American Union.
[40:49.720 --> 40:51.920]  This is all about global government.
[40:51.920 --> 40:55.440]  And they're openly saying back that up.
[40:55.440 --> 41:01.720]  This is a YouTube video we've got up in the story that Paul Watson and Aaron Dix wrote.
[41:01.720 --> 41:08.400]  Mexican president wants to disarm Americans, Aaron Dix, Felipe Calderon pressures US leadership
[41:08.400 --> 41:14.120]  to reenact unconstitutional assault weapons ban from House floor.
[41:14.120 --> 41:15.120]  And then it continues.
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.040]  Congressman slams outrage of Calderon lecture on immigration.
[41:19.040 --> 41:24.280]  That's from prisonplanet.com, Paul Joseph Watson, but look, there's time to save the
[41:24.280 --> 41:26.720]  United States.
[41:26.720 --> 41:29.560]  There's time to save it.
[41:29.560 --> 41:34.960]  Free countries are incredibly rare.
[41:34.960 --> 41:39.160]  And you need to understand that Mexico is fully collapsed.
[41:39.160 --> 41:41.400]  It is a failed state.
[41:41.400 --> 41:45.960]  Every top sociologist we talk to, every person that studies geopolitical developments, but
[41:45.960 --> 41:47.880]  just the evidence in front of our face.
[41:47.880 --> 41:53.240]  It is a failed, collapsed state.
[41:53.240 --> 41:58.640]  And the only real economy down there, thanks to NAFTA, deindustrializing what was in Mexico,
[41:58.640 --> 42:03.560]  it's all moved to China and India now, is narcotics and it's $500 billion a year coming
[42:03.560 --> 42:04.560]  through there.
[42:04.560 --> 42:07.720]  And people are going to fight to get a piece of that money.
[42:07.720 --> 42:12.280]  And Calderon basically is on the record, the army is going to ship it in, he's going to
[42:12.280 --> 42:16.240]  make 100% of it with the big L heffies that run Mexico.
[42:16.240 --> 42:20.800]  And anybody tries to take a cut into that, Los Zetas and the Pentagon-backed trained
[42:20.800 --> 42:23.480]  forces are coming in to kill you.
[42:23.480 --> 42:28.480]  And the Mexican people are saying, you know what, we're going to get some of this money.
[42:28.480 --> 42:31.280]  And you know, quite frankly, who can blame them?
[42:31.280 --> 42:34.960]  And so they are tearing up the U.S. forces down there and the Mexican forces.
[42:34.960 --> 42:40.080]  Yes, folks, our government grows the poppies, the Marines grow it, the army grows it in
[42:40.080 --> 42:41.080]  Afghanistan.
[42:41.080 --> 42:43.080]  They even put it on TV, they think it's so stupid.
[42:43.080 --> 42:47.680]  Okay, yeah, we're growing it, but it's still bad.
[42:47.680 --> 42:50.400]  You legalize this crud overnight.
[42:50.400 --> 42:52.080]  All of this stuff would end.
[42:52.080 --> 42:54.520]  They keep it illegal to keep the price up.
[42:54.520 --> 42:58.400]  Felipe Calderon wants our guns, give me a break, mafia boss.
[42:58.400 --> 43:05.080]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[43:05.080 --> 43:06.080]  tyranny is here.
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.200]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[43:10.200 --> 43:12.640]  It really says that the state is God.
[43:12.640 --> 43:17.160]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[43:17.160 --> 43:18.400]  on earth.
[43:18.400 --> 43:23.200]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[43:23.200 --> 43:25.040]  expanded nationwide.
[43:25.040 --> 43:29.720]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[43:29.720 --> 43:31.000]  shadow state.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.200]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.600]  Repair to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.680]  Police cameras, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[43:44.680 --> 43:45.680]  corner.
[43:45.680 --> 43:48.920]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[43:48.920 --> 43:50.960]  The police state isn't coming.
[43:50.960 --> 43:51.960]  It's here.

[44:01.440 --> 44:04.440]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[44:04.440 --> 44:08.800]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[44:08.800 --> 44:09.800]  do you want?
[44:09.800 --> 44:11.840]  My answer would be all I can get.
[44:11.840 --> 44:16.840]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[44:16.840 --> 44:18.080]  How much do you want?
[44:18.080 --> 44:19.160]  When do you want it?
[44:19.160 --> 44:21.120]  Now or after the battle starts.
[44:21.120 --> 44:22.240]  When will you need it?
[44:22.240 --> 44:24.360]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[44:24.360 --> 44:25.680]  Will there be any food?
[44:25.680 --> 44:27.160]  Will it make your children sick?
[44:27.160 --> 44:31.280]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[44:31.280 --> 44:32.480]  and be immunized?
[44:32.480 --> 44:36.240]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[44:36.240 --> 44:39.800]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[44:39.800 --> 44:41.040]  How much will you need?
[44:41.040 --> 44:42.040]  We don't know.
[44:42.040 --> 44:43.040]  How much do you want?
[44:43.040 --> 44:44.040]  All you can get.
[44:44.040 --> 44:45.040]  I'm Alex Jones.

[45:59.200 --> 46:02.800]  They help to create a new world order.
[46:02.800 --> 46:08.760]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[46:08.760 --> 46:12.480]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[46:12.480 --> 46:13.480]  documents.
[46:13.480 --> 46:17.920]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[46:17.920 --> 46:20.400]  It means all the world under their control.
[46:20.400 --> 46:23.160]  The United Nations would take over America.
[46:23.160 --> 46:26.480]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[46:26.480 --> 46:31.400]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[46:31.400 --> 46:33.920]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[46:33.920 --> 46:38.400]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[46:38.400 --> 46:39.400]  financial system.
[46:39.400 --> 46:42.280]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[46:42.280 --> 46:45.960]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[46:45.960 --> 46:47.120]  And I got news for you.
[46:47.120 --> 46:48.800]  You're everyone else.
[46:48.800 --> 46:49.800]  Invisible Empire.

[47:01.800 --> 47:05.480]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[47:05.480 --> 47:35.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:35.240 --> 47:39.960]  The Mexican president, the head of a failed state who has crime just pouring into our
[47:39.960 --> 47:46.840]  country of every level, money laundering, murder, kidnapping, police being slaughtered,
[47:46.840 --> 47:47.840]  racial killings.
[47:47.840 --> 47:53.240]  They teach in Mexico, the Southwest belongs to Mexico, that it's their duty to do this.
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.080]  Thank God most Hispanic Americans are aware of this brainwashing and have decided to be
[47:57.080 --> 47:58.080]  Americans.
[47:58.080 --> 47:59.080]  And I say true sides.
[47:59.080 --> 48:03.400]  Do you support the Bill of Rights Constitution, private property, Second Amendment or being
[48:03.400 --> 48:05.920]  a slave to Felipe Calderon?
[48:05.920 --> 48:08.280]  And I'm going to open the phones up on this issue next hour.
[48:08.280 --> 48:15.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 888-201-2244-888-201-2244.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.200]  But it has got my blood boiling.
[48:19.200 --> 48:21.080]  And I think about it as a kid.
[48:21.080 --> 48:24.840]  Why would my parents take me down to Mexico, I guess because it's beautiful, and then
[48:24.840 --> 48:30.040]  to be pulled over by cops and shaken down like we were slaves and groveling to them.
[48:30.040 --> 48:32.720]  And now they just arrest you and take everything you got.
[48:32.720 --> 48:36.360]  Why isn't that on our media how Americans are treated in Mexico?
[48:36.360 --> 48:41.960]  Why isn't more on our media how they're targeting police to kill them in the U.S. on record?
[48:41.960 --> 48:48.400]  Why isn't it in our media because our government is run by criminals that want to destroy our
[48:48.400 --> 48:49.400]  sovereignty?
[48:49.400 --> 48:51.120]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[48:51.120 --> 48:52.320]  We're the wealthy nations.
[48:52.320 --> 48:57.960]  The big banks will bring in any outside group they can that will vote for the tyranny.
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.840]  But I'm already digressing.
[49:01.840 --> 49:03.480]  Has NAFTA and GATT been good for you, folks?
[49:03.480 --> 49:05.320]  Has globalism been good for you?
[49:05.320 --> 49:12.680]  If you think NAFTA and GATT, now, what is it, 17 years old, was bad, the rest of the
[49:12.680 --> 49:15.360]  New World Order is 100 times worse.
[49:15.360 --> 49:16.760]  They've already bankrupted us.
[49:16.760 --> 49:17.760]  They've already killed the dollar.
[49:17.760 --> 49:20.000]  They just haven't announced it to you yet.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.280]  Our economy is dead.
[49:21.280 --> 49:22.560]  It's not coming back.
[49:22.560 --> 49:24.160]  It's not designed to come back.
[49:24.160 --> 49:25.600]  The big banks brag.
[49:25.600 --> 49:28.080]  They're waging war against the real economy.
[49:28.080 --> 49:29.680]  Don't you understand that?
[49:29.680 --> 49:33.200]  Wall Street and the big central banks are not free market.
[49:33.200 --> 49:34.800]  They're monopoly men.
[49:34.800 --> 49:38.480]  You mainland Republicans aren't going to find out.
[49:38.480 --> 49:39.840]  You're making me sick.
[49:39.840 --> 49:46.520]  Just the level of willful ignorance when this is so obvious that I'm shifting gears back
[49:46.520 --> 49:47.520]  into another subject.
[49:47.520 --> 49:51.640]  This next hour, we'll take your calls on all these subjects.
[49:51.640 --> 49:54.080]  Why is the system so mad at Rand Paul?
[49:54.080 --> 49:56.320]  Why is there a big hoax right now?
[49:56.320 --> 50:03.160]  It's like we go from one in 25,000 having autism a few decades ago to now one in 68.
[50:03.160 --> 50:05.120]  There's brain damage kids everywhere.
[50:05.120 --> 50:08.240]  The vaccine inserts admit they brain damage the kids.
[50:08.240 --> 50:12.480]  So they have these hoaxes all over the news where they claim that doctors have been disgraced
[50:12.480 --> 50:16.640]  and proven to be frauds that exposed autism from mercury.
[50:16.640 --> 50:18.200]  Then you actually go read what happened.
[50:18.200 --> 50:19.320]  None of it's true.
[50:19.320 --> 50:22.960]  It's a hoax.
[50:22.960 --> 50:27.280]  It was a hoax that the H1N1 was killing people when it wasn't, but it didn't matter.
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.880]  They still sold you tens of millions of dollars of vaccine.
[50:31.880 --> 50:33.520]  It's another hoax.
[50:33.520 --> 50:35.880]  Rand Paul is a libertarian conservative.
[50:35.880 --> 50:38.320]  He was asked, are you for the civil rights act?
[50:38.320 --> 50:41.600]  He said, yes, but I think it's been expanded too much to private clubs.
[50:41.600 --> 50:42.600]  Well, yeah.
[50:42.600 --> 50:46.600]  I mean, if you're white, can you force your way into a black fraternity or the Bohemian
[50:46.600 --> 50:49.080]  Grove is males only?
[50:49.080 --> 50:55.720]  I mean, we've seen civil rights suits because women reporters aren't allowed in the golf
[50:55.720 --> 50:58.920]  master's bathrooms.
[50:58.920 --> 51:00.560]  You're not part of the club, lady.
[51:00.560 --> 51:02.120]  It's not just that you're a woman.
[51:02.120 --> 51:03.120]  You're not allowed.
[51:03.120 --> 51:04.120]  You don't.
[51:04.120 --> 51:05.120]  This isn't your club.
[51:05.120 --> 51:08.920]  I mean, what can I go join the black panthers even if they don't want me when I'm as white
[51:08.920 --> 51:12.720]  as a cracker as white bread?
[51:12.720 --> 51:17.960]  I mean, you know, again, it's this religion of division in the name of unity.
[51:17.960 --> 51:23.400]  And so they take his statement and run this national hoax.
[51:23.400 --> 51:24.400]  And why did they do this?
[51:24.400 --> 51:25.640]  Because they're panicked by him.
[51:25.640 --> 51:29.000]  He admits there's a world government, a new world order that the carbon tax has meant
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.560]  to shut down our society, that he's going to fight it.
[51:32.560 --> 51:37.920]  One senator could block Elena Kagan, who openly says she wants to ban the Second Amendment
[51:37.920 --> 51:39.880]  and free speech.
[51:39.880 --> 51:43.040]  We've got her actual University of Chicago law review.
[51:43.040 --> 51:46.920]  We've taken the actual quotes out of it and have big articles up on my site.
[51:46.920 --> 51:50.920]  Panthers aren't even telling you how bad this lady is because they want that power.
[51:50.920 --> 51:53.080]  They're run by the same system, folks.
[51:53.080 --> 51:57.320]  Notice the Patriot acts passed by Bush, Obama expands it, and it's going to be used on you,
[51:57.320 --> 51:59.000]  the American people.
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.920]  You don't like having your ranch taken?
[52:00.920 --> 52:01.980]  You're a terrorist.
[52:01.980 --> 52:03.480]  You don't like your kids being brainwashed?
[52:03.480 --> 52:04.480]  You're a terrorist.
[52:04.480 --> 52:07.920]  I mean, do you understand what's happening?
[52:07.920 --> 52:17.200]  See, folks, the Republican incumbent just lost in Utah to a real Patriot conservative.
[52:17.200 --> 52:23.760]  Senator Spector, the magic bullet fraud, just lost because he's an incumbent in the primary.
[52:23.760 --> 52:30.400]  GOP wins House seat in Obama's Hawaii home district.
[52:30.400 --> 52:35.440]  They scored a midterm election victory Sunday when Honolulu City Councilman Charles Dajou
[52:35.440 --> 52:37.520]  won a Democratic held health promise.
[52:37.520 --> 52:41.400]  He isn't white, but they'll probably put a white guy's face up and say he's racist,
[52:41.400 --> 52:43.440]  though, because, you know, he must be racist.
[52:43.440 --> 52:45.040]  He's against the government health care plan.
[52:45.040 --> 52:46.040]  Must be.
[52:46.040 --> 52:47.800]  Again, they just throw it out there.
[52:47.800 --> 52:48.960]  They're the race pimps.
[52:48.960 --> 52:51.240]  They're invoking race.
[52:51.240 --> 52:55.120]  Republicans scored a midterm election Saturday when Honolulu City Councilman won.
[52:55.120 --> 52:56.120]  Boom.
[52:56.120 --> 52:57.840]  First time in 20 years, the Republicans won.
[52:57.840 --> 53:04.200]  Andrew Romanoff, an anti-establishment Democrat, got 60% of the state Democratic delegate Saturday,
[53:04.200 --> 53:08.360]  pushing him to the top of the line of the primary ballot over Senator Michael Bennett.
[53:08.360 --> 53:12.840]  They have a parliamentary system in Colorado, different than the rest of the country, but
[53:12.840 --> 53:16.320]  he's set to win there as the Democratic Party lines up against him.
[53:16.320 --> 53:18.880]  So why are they so upset?
[53:18.880 --> 53:23.640]  Everywhere there's an election, incumbents are being thrown out, and not just Republicans,
[53:23.640 --> 53:24.640]  not just Democrats.
[53:24.640 --> 53:26.440]  What did I tell you a year and a half ago?
[53:26.440 --> 53:27.640]  Senator Cornyn would give speeches.
[53:27.640 --> 53:29.400]  Rick Perry would give speeches at tea parties.
[53:29.400 --> 53:31.020]  They'd be booed off the stage.
[53:31.020 --> 53:33.960]  The liberal media wouldn't cover it.
[53:33.960 --> 53:41.200]  Then whenever other Democratic Congressmen like Lloyd Doggett got booed off, the media
[53:41.200 --> 53:43.480]  said it's a right-wing conspiracy.
[53:43.480 --> 53:44.480]  It's lobbyist.
[53:44.480 --> 53:45.480]  It's fake.
[53:45.480 --> 53:46.960]  And I was screaming bloody murder, going, no.
[53:46.960 --> 53:51.640]  People are mad at incumbents across the board, but the media made it all about Obama
[53:51.640 --> 53:54.880]  so he could be blamed to keep it in the left-right paradigm.
[53:54.880 --> 53:58.320]  So when he leaves office, the mainline Republicans get back in.
[53:58.320 --> 54:04.320]  See, as long as they can share power in the tag team, as long as that illusion is there,
[54:04.320 --> 54:05.480]  the globalists win.
[54:05.480 --> 54:10.240]  But the minute people realize it's incumbents and how they've actually voted, did they vote
[54:10.240 --> 54:11.280]  for the tarp?
[54:11.280 --> 54:12.680]  Did they vote for the open borders?
[54:12.680 --> 54:14.400]  Did they vote for the wars?
[54:14.400 --> 54:16.240]  It's a populist movement.
[54:16.240 --> 54:17.920]  Did they vote for bigger government?
[54:17.920 --> 54:20.040]  They're all being thrown out.
[54:20.040 --> 54:22.520]  And that's what can take Washington back.
[54:22.520 --> 54:26.920]  And then we have the state's rights movement, which the feds are now demonizing, saying
[54:26.920 --> 54:29.960]  there's going to be another Oklahoma city, and it's going to be the fall to the state's
[54:29.960 --> 54:30.960]  rights movement.
[54:30.960 --> 54:34.960]  See, they're scared to death of that, setting us up for a stage terror attack.
[54:34.960 --> 54:35.960]  They're going to stage.
[54:35.960 --> 54:39.840]  But listen, let's go ahead and play while they're so scared of Rand Paul.
[54:39.840 --> 54:47.040]  The next day, they come out and start saying he doesn't like black people with no evidence.
[54:47.040 --> 54:50.960]  Then they say, what do you think of the civil rights law, which they know all libertarians
[54:50.960 --> 54:58.800]  say, we think it's good, but it should be the states that did it, but it's been expanded
[54:58.800 --> 55:02.280]  to private clubs, and that's wrong.
[55:02.280 --> 55:06.320]  And they went completely crazy with that.
[55:06.320 --> 55:14.000]  So I guess if you want to have a black club, a white club, any other club, I guess La Raza,
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.400]  which means the race, I guess they got to let gringos in.
[55:16.400 --> 55:21.560]  You see, all this stuff's only one way, because whites are seen as the establishment by the
[55:21.560 --> 55:27.080]  ultra elite who are using everybody else to basically destroy any middle class groups
[55:27.080 --> 55:28.680]  that can oppose the big bankers.
[55:28.680 --> 55:33.640]  They don't want anyone with any money or any education to oppose them, you understand?
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.280]  But remember, everybody gets the fluoride in their water.
[55:37.280 --> 55:38.880]  Everybody gets the mercury in their shots.
[55:38.880 --> 55:39.880]  We're all in this together.
[55:39.880 --> 55:41.720]  We're all under attack by the system.
[55:41.720 --> 55:43.560]  But let's play Rand Paul.
[55:43.560 --> 55:48.120]  This is what's got him so mad at him and why they're engaged in a national hoax saying
[55:48.120 --> 55:49.120]  he's racist.
[55:49.120 --> 55:55.880]  Here it is.
[55:55.880 --> 56:02.240]  I have a message, a message from the Tea Party, a message that is loud and clear and
[56:02.240 --> 56:08.680]  does not mince words, we've come to take our government back.
[56:08.680 --> 56:14.600]  The Civil Rights Act isn't even one of his policies, so they just make it up.
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.560]  Part of the Fed is, we've come to take our government back from the special interest
[56:19.560 --> 56:24.760]  who think that the federal government is their own personal ATM.
[56:24.760 --> 56:31.920]  From the politicians who bring us oversized fake checks emblazoned with their signature
[56:31.920 --> 56:38.480]  as if it was their money to give, Washington is horribly broken.
[56:38.480 --> 56:41.040]  I think we stand on a precipice.
[56:41.040 --> 56:47.760]  We are encountering a day of reckoning and this movement, this Tea Party movement is
[56:47.760 --> 56:53.440]  a message to Washington that we're unhappy and that we want things done differently.
[56:53.440 --> 57:03.360]  Uh-oh, they're going to play race card.
[57:03.360 --> 57:06.600]  The Tea Party movement is huge.
[57:06.600 --> 57:11.040]  The mandate of our victory tonight is huge.
[57:11.040 --> 57:16.640]  What you have done and what we are doing can transform America.
[57:16.640 --> 57:25.040]  I think America's greatness hinges on us doing something to save the country.
[57:25.040 --> 57:26.040]  The Tea Party movement-
[57:26.040 --> 57:27.040]  Get pause.
[57:27.040 --> 57:28.920]  We're going to go to break, come back and play more of this in the next hour and take
[57:28.920 --> 57:29.920]  your calls.
[57:29.920 --> 57:33.680]  But you don't talk about America being great, you don't talk about free market, you don't
[57:33.680 --> 57:35.880]  talk about how the government's out of control.
[57:35.880 --> 57:37.640]  We'll play the race card on you.
[57:37.640 --> 57:42.440]  We've trained the public to clap like seals for your head if you don't want government
[57:42.440 --> 57:46.840]  health care, you're a racist, you're a racist, you're a racist, you're a racist, racist,
[57:46.840 --> 57:51.040]  racist, racist, they're race pimps.
[57:51.040 --> 57:52.720]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[57:52.720 --> 57:56.080]  You've heard me talk about Calben 5 star subs for years.
[57:56.080 --> 58:00.360]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find
[58:00.360 --> 58:01.360]  in stores.

[58:15.040 --> 58:20.040]  Since 1947, Calben soap company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and
[58:20.040 --> 58:21.480]  gentle on the environment.

[58:49.440 --> 58:50.640]  Thank you.
[58:50.640 --> 58:55.640]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[58:55.640 --> 58:56.640]  What have we got?
[58:56.640 --> 58:59.000]  A republic or a monarchy?
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.840]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[59:02.840 --> 59:07.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[59:07.000 --> 59:11.680]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[59:11.680 --> 59:12.680]  our money.
[59:12.680 --> 59:16.760]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[59:16.760 --> 59:20.280]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[59:20.280 --> 59:21.280]  You have me warned.
[59:21.280 --> 59:25.120]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common
[59:25.120 --> 59:26.120]  law.
[59:26.120 --> 59:30.120]  He is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't
[59:30.120 --> 59:31.120]  Tread on Me.
[59:31.120 --> 59:32.120]  Rise of the Republic.
[59:32.120 --> 59:35.960]  Terran, he is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people
[59:35.960 --> 59:36.960]  is rising.
[59:36.960 --> 59:39.600]  A new tool in the Info War, Don't Tread on Me.
[59:39.600 --> 59:47.720]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and support
[59:47.720 --> 59:51.880]  independent, patriotic, liberty films.
[59:51.880 --> 59:55.600]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:55.600 --> 01:00:02.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.880]  Oh, yeah!
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.880]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.880]  Turn me loose.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.880]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.880]  Set me free.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:10.880]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.880]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.880]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:21.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:34.680]  You know, I was ranting last hour because it's just all too much to have Rand Paul who's
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:45.320]  never even talked about the National Civil Rights Act demonized because he said he thinks
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.520]  it's taken too far when it comes to private clubs.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.440]  And when they asked him what he meant, he said, well, you know, like women in male clubs
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:01:00.120]  or men in women's clubs, I guess men need to, I've actually seen the news where transvestites
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.440]  keep demanding to be part of women's clubs and be in the bathrooms where the, come on
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.080]  folks, come on, we need the power of free association.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:14.400]  But it's the way that media makes this big deal, just everybody just breathing heavy
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.360]  and freaking out over it, but it's not going to work, I'm going to talk more about that
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.360]  coming up.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.360]  Right now, I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:27.000]  I've got a bunch of other news as well, but let's talk to a Fernando just hung up in Ireland.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.800]  I wanted to talk to the fellow in Ireland, Keith in Texas.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800]  You're on the air.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800]  Go ahead.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.800]  Yeah.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800]  Go ahead, Keith.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.800]  If you want to talk, we can talk.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800]  All right.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.720]  I just want to let you know the big call went through.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.680]  I got on the wrestling ball show.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:48.640]  I plugged invisible empire, the videos on the Funkmaster 5 channel on YouTube, Funkmaster
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.960]  5, all spelled out.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960]  You're kidding, Keith.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.440]  I think I said what was it six months ago or something that when you plug the films
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.240]  on air, you get a hundred bucks.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.240]  Didn't I say that?
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]  I got the big one.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.240]  I got the big one for you this time.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240]  It was tough.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.680]  It was the toughest one to get on, but I got them and I got two more to, I got Dennis
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680]  Miller.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.680]  I plugged it three times on his show and I got Hamity last week too.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.880]  Well, listen, send me your name and address and you get the cash.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.680]  I don't remember how much I said.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.680]  I didn't know that.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.680]  I just do it usually.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680]  You know me.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.680]  I know.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:24.240]  Well, no, that was, we had, we had Mark Dyson, he was saying, give people a free book and
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.240]  I said, I'll go further.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.280]  If you get Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity or Glenn Beck with one of my films, like the
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:35.200]  Obama deception or fall the Republic or any of them, you got a hundred dollars.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.200]  And so I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.440]  If on the show, you can have all the money back.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.680]  Yeah, but I want to give it to you.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.440]  So, so send me, plus I mean, I know you're for real, Keith, because I've seen your YouTube
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.440]  channel.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.240]  Give us, give us the YouTube channel again so we can pull it up for tomorrow.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.040]  So we have for the show.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.040]  Funkmaster five.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.040]  You just type in Funkmaster five and you get it.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.480]  Yeah, you can get it.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.720]  If you type it into Google or YouTube, I'm actually fixing to upload it right now.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.800]  I had to close down Firefox because it was messing up my signal here, but I'm going
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.160]  to upload it right when I hang up with you.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.640]  So I mean, I mean, what did Limbaugh say about it?
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.880]  Well, you know what?
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:17.800]  I got him to say he'll check it out to what he, you know, you know, have Limbaugh with
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.760]  his 20 plus million listeners, probably 50 million he's touched.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.920]  If he would just admit world government was real, instead of telling people it doesn't
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:26.920]  get close.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.880]  Well, I know he's getting close.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:34.360]  Of course he's now talking about it some because they're all over television saying world government
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360]  will save you.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.360]  We've got to have work.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.360]  Here's a message of Rush Limbaugh.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.040]  Rush, I know you get paid $40 million a year and you're a talented guy and not here telling
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.000]  you what to do and I have nothing against you, but save America.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.560]  Even if they, even if they do throw you off the air, I mean, how can you spend the almost
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.520]  billion bucks you've got?
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.680]  Just come out and play Herman von Roompi or Ban Ki-moon or any of these world leaders
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.120]  admitting they're setting up world government.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.520]  Explain to people that the private banks are tyrannical, are oppressive, are illegitimate.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.240]  Save the country, Rush.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.480]  Tell Republicans the truth.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:14.400]  Instead of going down in history as a political hack, please, Rush, please, man.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400]  Come on.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.320]  I mean, I appreciate your call.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320]  Keith, good to hear from you.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320]  All right.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.640]  I'm going to try to go faster to your calls.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.800]  I want to finish with the Rand Paul clip and talk about why he's in so much trouble.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:30.080]  Then we're going to go to John, Sean, David, Truth Patriot, Eddie, Henry, and I'm told
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.720]  Colonel Six is on there too, so we'll be getting to him, but I want to be fair to the other
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.760]  callers who haven't been on lately, but I want to hear what Colonel Six has to say, and
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.000]  I can just rant and rave all day.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.280]  You just happen to have the Mexican president who is such a crook up here telling me I got
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.880]  to turn my guns into him.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.360]  I mean, as a red-blooded American, that's how the war started in Texas and Gonzalez
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.120]  was the Tejanos wouldn't turn their guns in.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.560]  Half the people in Gonzalez that wouldn't turn it in, by the way, were Hispanic.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.560]  Don't call them Mexicans.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.560]  They were Texans.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.160]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.800]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.800]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800]  or gold?
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.200]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.360]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.920]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.920]  seeds.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:27.840]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.720]  food for you and your family.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.600]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.520]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.760]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:47.560]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:51.720]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:56.560]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.760]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:06.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.680]  a war on for your mind.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:21.040]  Okay, we're going to your calls, John, Shawn, David, Truth Patriot, Eddie, Henry, Colonel
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.560]  Six, and others here in a moment.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:29.520]  The toll-free number to join us is 888-201-2244, but I want to finish up with Rand Paul.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:37.640]  So Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning, he wins by 33 points above the establishment
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.280]  Republican and everywhere.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.120]  You're an establishment Democrat in the primary.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.120]  You lose.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.920]  You're an establishment Democrat in Hawaii.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.720]  You lose to a Republican.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.680]  The same thing just happened in Utah.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:57.000]  It just happened in Colorado yesterday, everywhere, every incumbent, and every person Obama has
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:04.960]  campaigned for has lost by double digits, double-digit losses.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.560]  I've studied political science.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.280]  I've studied all the major races going back over 200 years.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.960]  I'm obsessed with it, folks.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.960]  And let me just give you the newsflash.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.320]  This has never happened.
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.760]  People always blame one party or the other.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:23.640]  But now, remember those polls the last two years showing 11%, 9% approval ratings for
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.480]  Congress, both parties?
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:31.000]  People finally have figured out both parties are bought and paid for by the same interest.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.080]  And that's what Zbigniew Brzezinski said last week.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:40.440]  The article is Brzezinski decries global political awakening during CFR speech, a global political
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.160]  awakening to global government.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.440]  No longer are the people only looking at their puppets.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.160]  They're now looking at our global control system.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.760]  This is the greatest crisis we have ever faced as a power elite.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.600]  Go watch the video.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.320]  We can't just continue denying it doesn't exist.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:05.160]  Our big neocontactual hosts have done well for us, stalling the conservatives, but no
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.600]  longer does it work.
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.600]  Even the great Limbaugh will not be able to cover up much longer, comrades.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.480]  I mean, you know, these guys are in trouble, okay?
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.680]  That's why you tune into Limbaugh or into Savage or Hannity.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.760]  It's sounding more and more like the Alex Jones show, because they'll be passed say if they
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:28.600]  don't cover the reality when you've got hundreds of world leaders announcing a global government
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.040]  run by private banks.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:37.760]  And then Rand Paul does the unpardonable sin of coming out and saying carbon tax is a way
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.760]  to shut down America and its communist.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.480]  And you know, he declares war on the new world order.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.960]  And so they come after him with both barrels screaming racist.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:54.000]  They think it's the one attack angle they've got left folks, tens of thousands go to Google
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.320]  type in Rand Paul over 10,000 articles in Google news in the last three days demonizing
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.320]  him.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:07.040]  MSNBC has done 24 hour news cycles foaming at the mouth like he is Frankenstein come
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.480]  to kill us and we better get our pitchforks.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.560]  He's never talked about the Civil Rights Act.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:16.480]  He said on record he supports it, but that he thinks it's gone too far letting women
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.280]  in men's locker rooms was the original article they pulled up.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:26.400]  You heard about where these women demand to be in the NFL locker rooms, demand to go
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.600]  in with their microphones while people are in there, and then they file suit if they can.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:35.200]  That's what he's talking about on the on the Disabilities Act.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.440]  He said, what if it's a small business only make a $20,000 a year and somebody owns that
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.920]  themselves and they can't put in a wheelchair ramp or a $100,000 elevator to the second
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.920]  floor.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.160]  Oh, hey, he wants to take everything away from people in wheelchairs.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.040]  He's not even, that's not, those aren't even his issues.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.160]  He was asked as a libertarian what he thought of it.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.160]  Like a religion.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.280]  Oh, I guess I better let the bankers rob me.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.640]  I guess we better let Washington do what it wants.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.600]  God forbid he could be a racist.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.920]  That's this religion and but they've exposed themselves.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:15.840]  You say you're against government healthcare, slime ball Matthews, Carlos Watson, all of
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.120]  them say it's racist.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.480]  These are clan rallies.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.160]  They don't like black people.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.160]  They don't want the government running healthcare.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.360]  They're, they're, they're racist.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.360]  That's all they've got.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:32.040]  And what did I tell Salon Wyman, Mother Jones, Salon, Washington Post, they've all talking
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:38.200]  about me and Rand Paul, conspiracyist, conspiracist Alex Jones, Rand Paul is awesome.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.800]  And I went on to say, if you're an establishment Republican or Democrat, you are gone come
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.800]  November.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.480]  Jones said, this is, this is Wednesday, right before they launched their attack.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.380]  The good news is that people are coming in from both parties who have much better track
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.360]  records and don't have these establishment pedigrees.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.840]  He also warned the media against smearing Paul.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.600]  The mainstream media doesn't understand.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.400]  They are out of bullets when the mainstream media wants to hurt Rand Paul.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.360]  They should come out and endorse him.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.120]  When the establishment attacks someone, it only empowers them.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:12.320]  Uh, yeah, I'm afraid he was only about 17 points ahead of his democratic challenger
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.280]  in polls that came out Wednesday.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.400]  A new one came out today.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.720]  I'm afraid he's over 22%.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:24.000]  I'm afraid the attacks actually backfiring all, uh, see, it doesn't work anymore.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.600]  Criminal media, when you lie about people, they don't trust you anymore.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600]  Okay.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.560]  And you're going to be caught in your hoax as you always are, but, but let's finish
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.960]  up with the Rand Paul.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.960]  What has got them so upset in his victory speech when he declared war on the new world
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.960]  order?
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.960]  Here's the second part of that.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.880]  Uh, uh, no, no straight talking out of him.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.880]  You're not going to lead any American revolution against tyranny.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.800]  We're going to come out and we're going to paint a Hitler mustache on you, pal.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800]  Here it is.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:57.640]  The Tea Party movement is about saving the country from a mountain of debt that is devouring
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:02.480]  our country and I think could lead to chaos.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:08.560]  We now have a president though who apologizes for America's greatness.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:16.080]  We have a president who went to Copenhagen and appeared with Robert Mugabe, Hugo Chavez
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:22.840]  and others, Eva Morales to apologize for the industrial revolution.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:30.760]  They say these dictators, these petty dictators say that to stop climate change, it's about
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.800]  ending capitalism.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:39.080]  They are explicit and the president by attending Copenhagen gives credibility and credence
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:45.840]  to these folks and he should not go and CNN panics and cuts away.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.960]  They showed the entirety of the other victory speeches and boy, they cut away right there.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.120]  Oh, oh my gosh.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.120]  Don't talk about that.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.120]  That's the deal.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.120]  It's very simple.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.040]  The ultra rich have got their money.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.560]  They control the issuance of currency and credit.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:07.480]  They had their little rope ladder down to the cloud nine of wealth and power.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.800]  They're up there in Valhalla.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:16.640]  They're up there enjoying themselves and they've just pulled the rope ladder up just like this
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.400]  is a Donkey Kong where we don't get to climb, you understand?
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.360]  And so they're pulling the ladder up, taking it away from us.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.000]  That's what the carbon taxes are.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.160]  That's what all this control is.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.320]  They brag.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.720]  It's a post industrial world for you and your family.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.960]  How did naft and get turnout for you?
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.640]  How all these wars turnout for you?
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.400]  I told you eight and a half years ago the Patriot Act was written for the American people.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.000]  Now it's admitted it's for you.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.280]  You're the enemy regardless of what color you are and it's so asinine.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.360]  You know, Dr. Rand Paul is against abortion.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:57.040]  Do you hear the main line black leaders funded out there calling for an abortion?
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.960]  Boy, if I was black I sure would be.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.520]  I mean, if you've got any racial identity.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.280]  But see if you don't have any identity as a human being or for your culture because
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.160]  the media tells you that's bad.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.200]  So what if 51 to 52% of black people since 1973 were never born?
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.200]  That's right.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.880]  More than half the black people that were going to be born in this country, they don't exist.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.520]  They're deader than a hammer.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.520]  And guess what?
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.320]  Rand Paul doesn't want to kill you.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.840]  But you know who the real racists are?
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:29.000]  The Margaret Sanger liberals that curl up around you like a snake or like Rumpel Stilskin
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  in the new Shrek movie.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.200]  He took my kids to that.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.240]  Just reminded me of politicians.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.720]  In fact, try to YouTube Rumpel Stilskin's Shrek trailer.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.400]  I want to just, when we come back, show a short clip of how he talks, feels sweet.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.600]  Hi, oh, I want to help you.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.720]  And that's Margaret Sanger in the Rockefeller documents.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.720]  I've sent off to universities.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.440]  I've got the actual copies of their letters.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.560]  How do we kill these subhuman weeds?
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.360]  I just want to get rid of them as soon as I can.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.200]  Oh, oh, this is in the 20s.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.960]  We'll pose as liberals.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:14:59.960]  That's how we'll get them.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.080]  So they'll trust us and we'll hire blacks as our fronts and we're going to kill them.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.840]  Oh, it's going to be so good.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.800]  Oh, oh, it was so liberal, liberal.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:13.120]  Meanwhile, he got some doctor going, we shouldn't abort all the babies.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.640]  Shut up, racist.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:19.160]  The truth is, they're like, if people get in like this guy, we won't be able to kill
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.160]  the black people.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.160]  We're only able to kill half of them right now.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.800]  Oh, we want to kill more of them.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:29.400]  What are we going to do if these patriot Christian conservatives get in?
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.720]  They're going to stop murdering all the babies.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.720]  Ah.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:38.720]  You got to go read Margaret Sanger, these subhuman weeds.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.320]  How do we exterminate them?
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.840]  Well, John D. Rockefeller had a good meeting with him last week.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.560]  He says we'll pose as liberals and we'll have a total movement where we lead the blacks,
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:53.640]  that way they trust us so we can exterminate them, exterminate you, murder you, because
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.800]  it's so liberal, murder you.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:01.760]  But meanwhile, Rand Paul says you can have a private club.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.720]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.080]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.080]  do you want?
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.080]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.080]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.320]  How much do you want?
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.320]  When do you want it?
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.480]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.600]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.920]  Will there be any food?
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.400]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:31.520]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.680]  and be immunized?
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.480]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.080]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.320]  How much will you need?
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.320]  We don't know.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.320]  How much do you want?
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.320]  All you can get.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.400]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:56.040]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.800]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.120]  Hi this is Alex Jones.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.080]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.680]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.280]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than a real
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.280]  silver or gold?
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.080]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.240]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.800]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.800]  seeds.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.720]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.560]  food for you and your family.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.560]  And here's the best part.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.880]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.360]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.640]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:48.440]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.920]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.440]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.800]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:06.320]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.160]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.160]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:19.480]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:25.040]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:31.320]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:35.640]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:40.960]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:46.240]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:52.200]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.800]  Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:19:00.800]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:05.080]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap,
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:09.680]  not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.400]  and operated American company.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:16.200]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.840]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.840]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving triple-concentrated soaps
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.840]  anywhere.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:32.400]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.400]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:42.400]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.400]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:58.400]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website, 5starsoap.com, for buying a one-to-two month
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.400]  soap sampler.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:00.400]  Thank you.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:05.400]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:10.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:22.400]  By the way, criticizing Rand Paul because he believes people should be able to have
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:28.320]  private clubs where they can set the rules to who gets in is, I mean, is the next step
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:34.320]  from government.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:39.320]  But the way they hype this, the way they push it, it shows you how threatened they are.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:45.320]  But don't worry, every other establishment candidate is losing in every race.
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:49.320]  But they're really afraid of him because he stood up and said, I'm going to be a leader
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:54.320]  to go up against the takeover of America and the world government and the carbon tax, as
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320]  he said on this show.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:59.320]  And it's all over the news that he's come on this show and said he's against the one-world
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:00.320]  government.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.320]  He'll actually talk about it when he sees a world leader on television calling for global
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.320]  government.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.520]  He'll come out and say that's wrong, losing our sovereignty.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.600]  He won't ignore the facts, and that's why they're going after Rand Paul.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.320]  So donate to him, support him, tell everybody, you know, in Kentucky it's brainwashing and
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.320]  lies.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.320]  But the polls show it's only backfired on him.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:26.320]  I know there's many, many callers holding here trying to give each caller about one minute.
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.320]  Sean, David, Truth, Patriot, the list goes on and on.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.320]  One minute comment or question.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.320]  Sean, you're on the air.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.320]  Thanks for holding from Chicago.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.320]  Alex, I'm going to be brief.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:41.320]  First of all, when it comes to broadcasting, you are about the best.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.320]  I was a huge limbo fan.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:48.320]  I've listened to a lot of guys broadcasting, but if you're self-taught, you're brained
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320]  and you're about the best.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.320]  My point I'm going to make about Rand Paul and the media backfired on him.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:57.320]  Rand Paul, he has gone through absolutely nothing to melt the Gibson.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.320]  He did not go through with the Passion of Christ.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.320]  If you remember that movie, everybody demonized it.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.320]  It was the biggest opening day for a foreign movie film.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:13.320]  Christians came out, people came out and they supported Mel Gibson.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.320]  I think that's going to happen to Rand Paul.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:21.320]  I think the media can say what they want about him just like they did with Mel Gibson back then.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:26.320]  I think it's going to be a bloodbath for the Democratic opponent.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:30.320]  I'm going to let you go, but thank you for waking me up.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:37.320]  On 3.55 about a year ago, somebody wrote infowars.com and spray paint on a bypass.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.320]  Thank you.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.320]  I saw that.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.320]  I turned into infowars.com.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:45.320]  Whoever that guy was, you woke me up and thank you.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.320]  God bless you, Sean.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.320]  I appreciate your call.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.320]  Speaking of the Gibsons, I know the Gibsons and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.320]  I never heard anything racial out of their mouths.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:01.320]  It became a self-fulfilling prophecy with what was done to his film, which did backfire.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.320]  It made about $2 billion off of it.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.320]  That became a self-fulfilling prophecy itself and then he got mad at the cop.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.320]  There was an exchange there.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:17.320]  But again, it shows how this is our religion is obsessing on race or religion, which then only makes it bigger
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.320]  instead of how big corporate interests are robbing us.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.320]  But I agree.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:27.320]  Unless Rand Paul buys into the hype and the mind control that he's bad, which he isn't doing,
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:32.320]  and unless the public buys into the hype, this is only going to help him.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.320]  All the media's got is hoaxes.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:40.320]  I told Salon, I said, you're out of bullets.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.320]  It's not working anymore.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.320]  People don't buy your demonization.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.320]  Just like with Ron Paul, they called him a racist and all that stuff made up.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:51.320]  Now he's their darling because they failed.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.320]  Now he's a political force in America.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.320]  But everything we're doing doesn't ride on Rand Paul regardless.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:03.320]  It rides on the awakening that's happening and every incumbent being thrown out in the primary.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.320]  It's already started in both parties.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:10.320]  You know how scared the system is?
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.320]  People better be upset.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.320]  We better take this country back.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.320]  We better slash the size of government and get our bill of rights back.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.320]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.320]  The banks have already stolen trillions and trillions of dollars.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:25.320]  They've already bankrupted us.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:30.320]  We've got to get control of the government and default on this debt or it's only going to get worse.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.320]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.320]  Yeah, just real quick.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.320]  It's only taking a minute.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:42.320]  The first point I want to make is that, and if Rand, you're listening out there, you can use this.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:48.320]  Obama had a hot minute to get down to Louisiana and take care of business.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.320]  Now, Teddy Roosevelt was president right now.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:59.320]  He'd be down there right now with a shovel covering those beaches to save the rest of Louisiana and the rest of our country.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:05.320]  Okay, because we're under attack by corporations from England.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:10.320]  And my next point is that the branding has changed.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:18.320]  As of two days ago, Obama's speech at West Point, it is now the new international order.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:23.320]  Oh, no, he said we're a new international order and he told the troops, you must fight climate change.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.320]  And they're training the troops to take your farm, take your ranch, shut down your factory.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:33.320]  The Pentagon's new job is fighting carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.320]  Yep.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.320]  And I have a quick question for you.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:42.320]  I don't know if this is true or not, but is there just one chapel in the United Nations building?
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.320]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.320]  Yes, there's one new age chapel in the building.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.320]  All right.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.320]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.320]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.320]  I appreciate you, John.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:56.320]  In fact, we've got the new international order speech at West Point, don't we?
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.320]  We'll play that coming out of the next break.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.320]  All right, let's move quick here.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.320]  Truth patriot in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.320]  Alex, how's it going, buddy?
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.320]  You're the man.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:14.320]  All right, I called in last week and the idea that I put out there is kind of gone viral on Facebook.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:20.320]  The idea was to kind of have a bank run, stop paying our mortgages and our credit cards,
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:25.320]  and take our license plates off of our cars on the 4th of July, 2012.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.320]  And just so many people have been adding this page to their Facebook.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.320]  You know, I don't want to throw a plug out there.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.320]  No, it's fine.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.320]  But people have heard it a lot.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.320]  Write an article.
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.320]  Send it to ridersandinfowars.com.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.320]  We'll get it up.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.320]  Okay.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.320]  Let's go to Eddie in New Hampshire.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.320]  Eddie, you're on the air.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320]  Hey, buddy.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320]  Hi, brief.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.320]  Hi.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:49.320]  I just want to ask you about an article we have up on our prison planet website.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:56.320]  It's way between now and, I believe, August, the US planes and four to five more aircraft carriers,
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.320]  as well as other warships to the Persian Gulf.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:05.320]  Now, I would think that if you send that sort of firepower to a region, you plan on using it.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:10.320]  Yeah, for those that don't know, they've got four aircraft carriers now in the Gulf.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:17.320]  They've moved bunker busters and nukes into Diego, Garcia, and out there off the coast of Africa.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:23.320]  And they are really, well, Israel's openly talking about striking Iran with nukes.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:32.320]  And most analysts believe this could, that there's a probability, start a potential World War III between Russia and China and the US.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:40.320]  And what it just came out, got declassified last week that the US considered a joint strike with Russia in the 60s against China.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.320]  So, I mean, look, this is serious.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:50.320]  And the globalists are in so much financial trouble, they may start a huge war to get everybody to kind of forget about the banks robbing you,
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.320]  forget about the depression, forget about the 20-plus percent unemployment that the media says is 10 percent.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:00.320]  You know, forget about how you're graduating from college and have no hope of a job ever.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.320]  You know, forget about that.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.320]  We're in a war, so you better keep your mouth shut.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:14.320]  Absolutely. And my question to you is, if Iran stands down, shows no aggression whatsoever, the powers would be, the powers would be,
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.320]  we'll have to concoct some sort of false flag, most likely here on our soil.
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.320]  Well, that's right.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:29.320]  If the globalist bombard Iran, and Iran was smart enough to not fight back, 100 percent chance the Pentagon would stage terror attacks and say Iran did it.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.320]  But Iran is not going to stand down.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:35.320]  Their entire posture is to attack Iraq, invade the forces there.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.320]  They've got sleeper cells all over the country.
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:40.320]  Our government has not fought a real enemy since Vietnam.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.320]  And when they attack Iran, that is what's going to happen.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:48.320]  A real enemy is going to go absolutely ape, and the globalists aren't going to have to stage terror attacks.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.320]  The Iranians have got forces in the U.S.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:58.320]  They're going to set fire to skyscrapers, blow up schools, which is exactly what the globalists want, because they just want to destroy this country.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.320]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:05.320]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.320]  tyranny is here.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:10.320]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.320]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:18.320]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:25.320]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:31.320]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.320]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:39.320]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:45.320]  Body scammers, sound cannons, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.320]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.320]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.320]  It's here.

[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.320]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:09.320]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:14.320]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.320]  Food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.320]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.320]  Now or after the battle starts.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.320]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.320]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.320]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.320]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:31.320]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:35.320]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:39.320]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.320]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.320]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:42.320]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.320]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:47.320]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:55.320]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:59.320]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:05.320]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:09.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:23.320]  Folks, sometimes if I sound sped up and frustrated, it's because we've got pirates in the Gulf
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:30.320]  of Mexico and on Texas lakes from Mexico robbing American citizens, cops being killed, ranchers
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:36.320]  being murdered, arson all over Texas, Arizona and in Mexico.
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.320]  I've got stacks of these articles here.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.320]  17 states now filing versions of Arizona's immigration bill, which by the way is totally
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:50.320]  constitutional, says if the cops have already pulled you over for something and you're here
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.320]  illegally, they're going to take you to jail.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.320]  Of course, if you're a citizen, you get the book thrown at you.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:59.320]  Top official says feds may not process illegals referred from Arizona.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:01.320]  That's out of the AP.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.320]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.320]  I've already seen the stories over the years where sheriffs and others will arrest illegal
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.320]  aliens, commit crimes.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:12.320]  They'll call ICE and ICE won't come pick them up.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:16.320]  That's a division of Homeland Security that deals with border enforcement.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.320]  In fact, people won't believe this.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:26.320]  Google the term ICE gives illegals jobs.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.320]  ICE gives illegals green cards.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:34.320]  Or Homeland Security uses illegals to build border fence.
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:37.320]  So when they have these fake raids two or three times a year where they raid like a
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.320]  thousand illegals, it's a meat-bagging plant because it's a monopoly.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.320]  If you're not illegal, you can't basically work there.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.320]  That's how it works because the wages are so low.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.320]  That's priced everybody out of the market.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:54.320]  And it's just so amazing that when they bust them, they then take them and give them all
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:56.320]  green cards.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.320]  I mean, that's your traitorous federal government, folks.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.320]  No country is this open.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:02.320]  Our country is collapsing.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.320]  There it is.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:07.320]  ICE gives work permits to 27 illegal aliens in Seattle raid.
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.320]  ICE cancels customs inspection.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.320]  They might find illegal aliens.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.320]  Head agent, don't tell, and then it goes on from there.
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:18.320]  But you can pull up the one where illegals build border fence.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.320]  It's supposed to be 200 miles long.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:21.320]  They built like 50 miles of it.
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.320]  Totally fake.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.320]  You know, an elephant could get through it.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.320]  I mean, a jet airplane could, you know, roll through it.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.320]  A star destroyer could drive through it.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.320]  I mean, it's all right.
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:32.320]  I'm ranting.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.320]  There's just so much news just like this here.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:39.320]  Meanwhile, every basic freedom of an American citizen is just out the door.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.320]  We have absolutely no rights.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:47.320]  Here's that clip from West Point at the commencement a few days ago.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:51.320]  Just like Obama earlier, we played the clip, said America's not defined by its borders.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:54.320]  It's more of an idea than a place, North American Union.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:36:01.320]  Here he is telling West Point that it's, you know, basically the new international order that they serve this order
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:06.320]  and that they serve the fight against carbon, against carbon dioxide.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.320]  Here it is.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:13.320]  We have to shape an international order that can meet the challenges of our generation.
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:18.320]  We will be steadfast in strengthening those old alliances that have served us so well,
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:23.320]  including those who will serve by your side in Afghanistan and around the globe.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:29.320]  As influence extends to more countries and capitals, we also have to build new partnerships
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:34.320]  and shape stronger international standards and institutions.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:38.320]  This engagement is not an end in itself.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:43.320]  The international order we seek is one that can resolve the challenges of our times,
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:48.320]  countering violent extremism and insurgency, stopping the spread of nuclear weapons
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:55.320]  and securing nuclear materials, combating a changing climate and sustaining global growth,
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.320]  helping countries feed themselves and care for their sick.
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.320]  That's enough.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:08.320]  Obama took the restrictions off and then doubled the previous funding for forced abortions and fantasies worldwide.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:15.320]  Oh, here's the Guardian. Stopping nukes revealed how Israel offered to sell South Africa nuclear weapons.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:20.320]  Secret apartheid-era papers give first official evidence of Israel's nuclear weapons.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.320]  Israel and the U.S. helped give AQcon labs the nukes in Pakistan.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.320]  There, I mean, our government hands nukes out.
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:37.320]  The head of ABB in 1996, he got Clinton authorization for it, was former and then he served again
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:41.320]  as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. He gave them the reactors.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:46.320]  Meanwhile, Iran is even offering to have France in Richard's uranium so it can't be using weapons.
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:49.320]  No, you're going to get attacked. No.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:56.320]  We used to run you and take all your oil and we staged a coup in 53 and then you threw us out in 79.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.320]  That oil is ours. Shut up. The nuking will begin momentarily.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.320]  Oh, South Africa wants some nukes.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.320]  Oh, Pakistan wants some nukes.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:07.320]  North Korea wants some nukes. Here they are, baby.
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:13.320]  Now, menace everyone. See, they like North Korea there.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.320]  Probably on the globalist payroll to menace Japan, keep them in line.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.320]  And then they love Pakistan to menace India and China.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:25.320]  And they love South Africa menacing everyone.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.320]  Oh, it's just so sick how they operate.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.320]  All right, I'm out of control today.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:34.320]  Colonel Six in Texas, then David, Henry, Mark, Rolando, Brent, Joshua and others.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.320]  We'll get to all those calls at least.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.320]  Colonel Six, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.320]  Yeah, I'm going to be real quick.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:48.320]  If you go to colonelsix.com, you'll see where the mainstream media in the United States are not telling
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:53.320]  half of the story with North Korea and South Korea.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:59.320]  For instance, early this morning, we arrested a Korean female spy,
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:05.320]  North Korean female spy, who had smacked into South Korea as a refugee.
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:16.320]  She got classified information from a subway worker that was over a great portion of the security and so forth.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:29.320]  In order to stage attacks on the subway there, the North Koreans, Kim Jong-il is insisting that so
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:39.320]  accept the delegation from North Korea to inspect the children themselves.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:47.320]  For those that don't know, it's now been confirmed by the South Koreans and others that that was a torpedo attack
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:52.320]  to kill 50 plus people and now the North's basically bragging about it.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:40:01.320]  All I know is our government allowed nukes to be given to him and I think they love the fact that he's a complete psychopath.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:11.320]  Let me tell you one other thing. There's a general, General Kim Jong-un, who had been demoted to a three star.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:18.320]  After this attack on the channel and sinking it, he was promoted back to a four star.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:27.320]  And that was his reward for putting off this operation in good fashion.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:34.320]  Again, I can say I don't mean to overhide, but if you look at Colonel Six dot com, it's about intelligence.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.320]  It's about telling people things.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:44.320]  I will give a sure take on what's about to happen in North Korea because while we're all busy running around in fear of Rand Paul,
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:49.320]  who may get us and the bankers are robbing us, but that's not a problem.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:55.320]  We're all running around in fear of Iran, meanwhile North Korea is running around foaming at the mouth.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:07.320]  Well, North Korea has some 70,000 Special Forces troops lined up on the southern border with South Korea.
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:29.320]  And they also have some major alert that he has said to South Korea and to Secretary of State Clinton that anything that South Korea does is going to be a provocation for all that war.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:39.320]  I mean, if they don't let them come in and inspect the ship, China is kind of in the mix there.
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:44.320]  China wanted to kind of reel...
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.320]  Let me ask you this. Could the ship be a false flag?
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.320]  No.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:59.320]  I don't think so either because North Korea has bragged about blowing up ships and torpedoing ships and grabbing them before.
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:07.320]  Kim Jong-il has a seven-story pleasure palace and kidnaps Asian film stars who he then tortures and rapes to death.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:11.320]  This is big government. This is what big government people would have us.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:24.320]  Liberals and socialists would have us all under... I mean, it always ends with some little guy with a pot bellied and a big high forehead with big Coke bottle glasses and a gray or blue jumpsuit walking around.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:30.320]  Doesn't matter if it's the Germans or if it's the Russians or if it's the Chinese or if it's the Cubans.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:36.320]  I'm tired of little men in jumpsuits telling me I got to lick their boots up and down both sides.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:45.320]  Okay, I'm free, I got private property, I own guns, I'm sick of the government trying to rip me off and bankrupt my country, and I'm done.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.320]  We're going to accelerate through final calls, David and others, straight ahead.

[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.320]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:20.320]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:25.320]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:33.320]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:39.320]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:42.320]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:48.320]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.320]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:09.320]  When you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:14.320]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:18.320]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:23.320]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:26.320]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:31.320]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:35.320]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:39.320]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.320]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:47.320]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:55.320]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:01.320]  Again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:10.320]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:21.320]  Here's the article. The story out of MPR, December 14, 2006.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:25.320]  Border fence firm snared for hiring illegal workers.
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:28.320]  See, we don't make anything up here.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:33.320]  Look, we have to get angry as Americans. We have to get territorial again.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:38.320]  Being an American doesn't just mean you salute the flag at a basketball game and start crying.
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:43.320]  It means you defend your private property, you defend your second amendment, you defend the republic.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:49.320]  And look, America isn't perfect, but it's a lot better than North Korea, Mexico, and communist China, and other countries.
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.320]  I mean, folks, we have the government documents.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:57.320]  We have the International Bank of Settlement documents where they said they were going to destroy the world economy
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:03.320]  by selling derivatives to countries to bankrupt them so the banks could come in and take over.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:07.320]  This is economic conquest. Grow up. It's really happening.
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:12.320]  We've got to save the country. We've got to admit what's going on
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:18.320]  and demand that the liberal establishment that isn't liberal at all
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:22.320]  be honest about the fact that they're a bunch of poverty pimp social manipulators
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.320]  and that the Republicans be honest about the fact they're a bunch of corporate whores
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:31.320]  sold out to foreign interest with NAFTA and GATT. It all has to end now.
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:36.320]  It's only going to get worse. And all we've got to do is sit here and explain to people who the bad guys are
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:40.320]  and how they did it and lay all the facts out, and these people are going to go down.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.320]  And they're openly talking about shutting the web down.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:49.320]  There's a headline here where the FCC says they now have power over the Internet and are going to install a fairness doctrine.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:54.320]  That's mainstream news. In fact, where's my headline?
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:49:00.320]  I can't even keep track of this anymore. It's just totally insane.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:06.320]  Cover it tomorrow. I can't find it now. I just can't believe that the new Supreme Court nominee
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.320]  has written more than 10 white papers saying ban free speech and the Second Amendment.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:17.320]  A woman should be in Maoist China, not here.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:24.320]  This is war, folks. This is an attack on the country. The government is criminal.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.320]  All right, let's go to David in South Carolina. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.320]  You got me, Alex.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.320]  Yeah, I got you. Go ahead.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:35.320]  Oh, great, man. I'm a four-year listener, first-time caller. I love everything you do.
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:37.320]  I really appreciate you taking my call.
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:39.320]  I appreciate you calling. What's on your mind?
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  The bottom line is the economic system is coming down and coming down in pieces like 9-11.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.320]  You know, this guy's graphically getting blasted.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:56.320]  And these guys, they have to divert everybody's attention from the fact that they cannot hold the...
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:01.320]  You know what they say? The center cannot hold.
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:05.320]  And they are tearing... This country is coming apart.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:11.320]  And what they're going to do is one of three things, possibly all three at the same time,
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:16.320]  is the situation in North Korea. They'll get us in a war with China.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.320]  The situation with Iran will probably get us in a war with Russia.
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:25.320]  And, of course, the situation with the illegals and this whole situation...
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.320]  Oh, they can give them the order to riot. They'll burn everything down.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:32.320]  The media will say, look how cute it is.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:37.320]  They'll bust us into little pieces. I'm just telling you, that's how I feel about it.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:43.320]  And I tell you what, I'm glad you've been covering this because it's great to have a good voice out there
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:46.320]  actually getting through the root of the matter.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:51.320]  Because instead of letting everybody get by with Glenn Beck and all these guys,
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:54.320]  they're barely touching on it and they're not really getting through it.
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:59.320]  And as far as Rand Paul goes, he's a great guy.
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:04.320]  He really is. He's sincere at least. He's decent and honest, I think.
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:06.320]  No, that's why they're coming after him.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:11.320]  Look, Arnold Schwarzenegger told Rolling Stone magazine in 1977,
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:15.320]  then in the 80s he gave other interviews in the 1990s. I mean, I made a film about it.
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:20.320]  It's an hour of the three-hour film, Marshall Law, that I made in 2005.
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:25.320]  And he said, I want to be like Hitler. I want to be a dictator. I hate Jews.
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:29.320]  And because he's now a sell-out globalist, the ADL gives him awards.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:34.320]  But then Rand Paul says nothing racial and the media is saying he's against the Civil Rights Act
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.320]  and they have no clip of him saying it. It's just made up.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:43.320]  It's just made up. They're a pack of crooks, folks. Listen, let me tell you something.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:47.320]  You actually get with a real liberal, all they talk about is reducing population,
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:52.320]  how much they hate minorities. I never heard the N-word until I was around liberals, okay?
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:59.320]  Because they're not liberals. They're parasite control freaks, okay?
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:03.320]  I just can't handle it anymore. I appreciate your call, David.
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:07.320]  Henry in Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:10.320]  Hello, Alex Jones. Can you hear me?
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.320]  Yes, I can. Go ahead.
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:17.320]  Okay, well, my phone's doing the automatic cough button thing right now,
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:23.320]  so it probably sound like I'm on Quailude. Go ahead, sir. Go ahead.
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:27.320]  I'm going to let you go. I'm going to let you go. I'm going to let you go. I'm going to let you go.
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:32.320]  I'm going to let you go. I just can't hear you. Mark in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.320]  Hey, great day, Alex. I want to commend you first of all.
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:43.320]  I want to commend for laying before God all the things that you've spoken out to the people that you've prayed in.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:48.320]  I think that's what we all need to do, and I've been looking at Romans about that.
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:54.320]  Rulers are not a terror, but to put away the good or put away the bad and then help the good.
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:53:00.320]  And I'm wanting to ask you just to let you just tell us all or a little bit about what info we have
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:04.320]  that proves the stealing of these people, all these big bank people,
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.320]  the people that are stealing all the money, and then what we can do.
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:10.320]  What is the four-step plan we can do to actually get that money back?
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:13.320]  Whatever the whole situation, I want you to just speak away.
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:16.320]  All right. I appreciate your call, Mark.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:26.320]  Look, we're at the end of the show, and I promised to go to calls, but I told you before they passed the Banker bailout act of October 2008
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:31.320]  that they weren't going to tell you where the money went and that it wasn't going to be used on the subprime mortgages.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:34.320]  And the next day, they said, we're not going to spend it on that.
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:40.320]  We're not going to tell you where it went. We have the Timberwolf emails and the McClatchy newspaper emails.
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.320]  They got in lawsuits separately.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:48.320]  I mean, Bernie Madoff made up fake assets and sold it, and that's what derivatives are.
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:55.320]  Bernie Madoff founded the NASDAQ and designed many of the current derivatives that are sold in the market.
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:00.320]  Same thing with Ken Lay. He was involved in global warming taxes and derivatives.
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:03.320]  What do you think carbon taxes are? It's a derivative.
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:05.320]  Okay. Bill Clinton was involved.
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:11.320]  The Republicans were involved in changing the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 so they could sell all this stuff.
[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:13.320]  It's counterfeit, okay?
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:20.320]  They sell it to governments and individuals so that they get money and power when they sell it to you at full value.
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:27.320]  Then, when everything falls apart, they come in with more fiat derivatives and loan that to you to get you out of the trouble.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.320]  But really, you wake up and realize you're deeper down the rat hole, okay?
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:35.320]  It's not a free market system. It's a rigged game.
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:42.320]  And these guys want to destroy the free market and blame capitalism because they want to cut the money off to everybody else now that they have it.
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:50.320]  I mean, Goldman Sachs, I've got articles here where they've dropped the suit against AIG and the government's dropped its criminal investigation.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:54.320]  And these criminal investigations of Goldman Sachs, it's a whitewash, folks.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:57.320]  We need to bring these people to justice.
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:03.320]  It's illegal that Henry Paulson gave himself $212 million of bailout money to himself.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:07.320]  And Congress, Congressman Stern, asked him, how'd you get a waiver? Who gave it to you?
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:09.320]  And he said, I gave myself a waiver.
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:13.320]  It's illegal. We don't owe the money.
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:20.320]  We monetize it because they've already monetized it. They're going to keep monetizing new bailouts, new ripoffs.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.320]  We monetize it now. It devalues the currency some. It's going to be painful.
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:29.320]  And then we're honest about the fiscal responsibilities.
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:33.320]  We get government out of the lives of the American people and 90% of what they do.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:40.320]  We keep the small government we need to guard our liberty, or we let them fully implode the economy and take over out of the crisis they created.
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:43.320]  And we're here at the chopping block point.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:48.320]  Do you guys find my FCC headline? I don't know where it is here in my stack.
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:51.320]  I had it right here in my stack, headline FCC to regulate Internet.
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:55.320]  There it is. FCC to re-regulate Internet in order to enforce net neutrality.
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:56:00.320]  Now, that's not the one. It's a new article I had today. It doesn't matter, whatever.
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:07.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rinaldo in New York City. Thanks for holding.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:11.320]  Good evening, Alex. Long time living there, first time caller.
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.320]  Welcome.
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.320]  Thank you very much. I don't know if we get past this, Alex.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:26.320]  It's under the mind control that the public is under. I try to warn my coworkers about what's going on here in New York City, the liberal capital of America.
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:32.320]  They just laugh, yeah, Obama's doing good. The endless work keeps going on, and they're not even protesting.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:35.320]  I don't know if we can survive this policy. I really don't.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:45.320]  Well, that is the thing. I went to the shopping mall, and it didn't matter what color people were, or how tall they were, or how short they were, they all look like zombies.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:52.320]  And they all look like children. It's like weak, soft children who giggle and laugh and are stupid.
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:57:02.320]  And you try to talk to yuppies. Either people are really awake when I go to public places and know who I am and run over and have a light in their eyes and know what's happening.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.320]  Or they're like these broke back little children.
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:16.320]  I mean, the public is like a bunch of domesticated pigs or something, who the master comes over and dumps some slop in, and they oink and snort and enjoy it, and they don't worry about anything.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:21.320]  And when they see one of the pigs get let off, they kind of snort and giggle because that means more slop for them.
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:28.320]  They don't know that pigs about to get butchered, and two days later they're going to be hanging up by their ankles, their throat getting slit, blood pouring everywhere.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.320]  They just think it's funny. God bless you.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:37.320]  Rinaldo, you can call me back tomorrow 11 to 3 central if you want to talk more. I sound frustrated here at the end. It was a good broadcast.
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:41.320]  I got a lot of info out, but I didn't cover two whole stacks of my news.
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.320]  So we'll be covering that all tomorrow. God bless you all.
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:58:01.320]  And if you're new here on Planet.TV and 4Wars.com, check out all the new films we've got out.
