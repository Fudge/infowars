[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.280]  we're going to have a particularly jam-packed and important worldwide
[00:29.280 --> 00:40.480]  transmission today thank you for joining us it is the 13th day of March 2012 well
[00:40.480 --> 00:48.320]  I had an extreme epiphany awakening understanding this morning and much of
[00:48.320 --> 00:55.400]  the realization I had I already knew but it really hit me hard right between the
[00:55.400 --> 01:04.680]  ice and I will break down this epiphany as best I can and I will make it one of
[01:04.680 --> 01:13.080]  the main goals of this radio show to explore this epiphany I have explored
[01:13.080 --> 01:27.600]  this some in the past but it is the big enchilada I felt like Saul of Tarsus on
[01:27.600 --> 01:40.040]  the road to Damascus it is in times of great change that we see the best the
[01:40.040 --> 01:48.400]  worst of people and I can tell you that society is in a very grave crisis not
[01:48.400 --> 01:56.000]  just militarily not just intellectually but in our gut in our spirit in our soul
[01:57.240 --> 02:03.120]  and I will break down this epiphany on the other side this realization this
[02:03.120 --> 02:09.400]  this this higher level of awakening that I've experienced and the and this this
[02:09.400 --> 02:13.560]  awakening is simple confirmation
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.760]  what's so bizarre I actually called Paul Watson during this happening and told
[02:23.760 --> 02:30.040]  him it was happening and he said no I'm noticing it too I'll give you a little
[02:30.040 --> 02:33.160]  hint people were just running off the road everywhere going into zombie state
[02:33.160 --> 02:38.200]  they're putting stuff in the water they got wavelengths going it is wild I mean
[02:38.200 --> 02:42.080]  we've all got a fight for our consciousness right now this is hardcore
[02:42.080 --> 02:46.880]  what's going on and something big is about to happen when I saw driving into
[02:46.880 --> 02:53.920]  work this morning was bizarre and it's even being pointed out in fact I saved
[02:53.920 --> 02:57.240]  the newspaper and then lost it on the RV coming back I don't know where it is
[02:57.240 --> 03:01.640]  guys can you guys type whatever the newspaper is in Orlando something like
[03:01.640 --> 03:05.640]  pedestrian accidents way up and then it gets into people not paying attention
[03:05.640 --> 03:09.760]  and walking out in front of cars and walking into fountains and falling off
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.440]  balconies because I kept meaning to pull up more data I knew it was important
[03:14.440 --> 03:18.240]  because I've been seeing it but the public now is just walking out in front
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.200]  of cars bicycles coming out on 70 mile an hour highways right in front of you
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.880]  vehicles just flying off highways people texting while driving you talk to the
[03:26.880 --> 03:30.440]  public on the street they're either totally awake or they're in zombie state
[03:30.440 --> 03:35.720]  and I'm already getting into the epiphany it's just I was seeing it this morning
[03:35.720 --> 03:39.980]  it was like a video game driving into work this morning just wrecking and
[03:39.980 --> 03:47.200]  splattering and and and jumping mediums and and and it was women just texting
[03:47.200 --> 03:50.200]  while they're driving with computer screens up their faces flying off
[03:50.200 --> 03:55.840]  highways and this is the insertion into the matrix they're coming out in fact we
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.880]  reprinted it came out last week new video games to interface with brain I
[04:00.880 --> 04:06.160]  mean it's all coming out these neural hookups I mean you put a kid in front of
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.280]  the TV you see him go into a trance state a literal sleepwalking brain wave
[04:10.280 --> 04:23.000]  occurs when you hook them up to to the different systems that read brain waves
[04:23.000 --> 04:31.000]  my god I don't know how we're gonna stand against this weapon system we're
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.040]  living in a science fiction movie I hope you realize that by the way what we
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.920]  told you eight years ago has now been publicly announced Google is the
[04:37.920 --> 04:47.240]  National Security Agency that's mainstream news DARPA it's an NSA two-way
[04:47.240 --> 04:53.320]  grid it's a crystal ball it's an electronic crystal ball system they now
[04:53.320 --> 05:02.440]  admit we're not in Kansas anymore it's 2012 I had tried everything I'd cut back
[05:02.440 --> 05:06.320]  the amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing
[05:06.320 --> 05:10.640]  was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.840]  as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of
[05:15.840 --> 05:19.920]  what I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of
[05:19.920 --> 05:24.240]  great products at info wars team.com but I want to point out the three that have
[05:24.240 --> 05:31.680]  helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months products like beyond tangy
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.480]  tangerine pollen burst and rebound when I started taking the tangy tangerine and
[05:36.480 --> 05:41.040]  other products every day I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months now
[05:41.040 --> 05:46.520]  that's results I want to challenge my listeners to go to info wars team.com
[05:46.520 --> 05:51.120]  and order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way

[06:12.840 --> 06:16.200]  have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[06:16.200 --> 06:19.920]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.320]  put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival

[08:05.240 --> 08:12.080]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.080 --> 08:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.680 --> 08:23.040]  Alex Jones
[08:28.680 --> 08:37.120]  it is Tuesday the 13th day of March 2012 really had him on for about 15 minutes
[08:37.120 --> 08:40.240]  Sunday didn't have time to finish our discussion I wanted to get into the
[08:40.240 --> 08:43.800]  latest on the world financial meltdown of what's happening in Europe and how
[08:43.800 --> 08:47.080]  that affects us with investigative journalist Greg Palace he'll be popping
[08:47.080 --> 08:51.240]  in for about 20 30 40 minutes I'm not sure in the second hour and then
[08:51.240 --> 08:55.840]  investigative journalist John Rappaport used to work for ABC News and CBS and
[08:55.840 --> 08:59.000]  decided to quit working for about 16 years ago to expose the globalist
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.920]  always an informative interview he'll be joining us on a host of issues I talked
[09:03.920 --> 09:08.320]  to Paul Watson this morning and he's gonna have breaking news you know about
[09:08.320 --> 09:14.840]  three weeks ago he found the big bioethics journal that is used for
[09:14.840 --> 09:18.800]  policy worldwide in hospitals they no longer have the Hippocratic oath to do
[09:18.800 --> 09:23.200]  no harm and they said we're gonna start killing people up to age three and old
[09:23.200 --> 09:27.680]  people if we decide the government decides your your life isn't worth
[09:27.680 --> 09:33.960]  living and and that we say you're not conscious then we are going to start
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.240]  killing you and then Christian Science Monitor London Telegraph Associated Press
[09:39.240 --> 09:44.400]  they all picked it up a few days later and it became a big discussion see they
[09:44.400 --> 09:47.680]  don't want to have all this rolled out now that they didn't want death panels
[09:47.680 --> 09:53.000]  being discussed pre passage of the health care bill after it was passed they
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.720]  said yeah you kill grandma you hire 10 teachers you know Bill Gates said and
[09:56.720 --> 09:59.880]  then they could have you know Newsweek with the cover story the case for
[09:59.880 --> 10:03.040]  killing granting showing an old lady with the plug being pulled on her on the
[10:03.040 --> 10:09.480]  cover the only way they can get away with this is that they have basically
[10:09.480 --> 10:14.280]  mesmerized the public when you hear folks say the public sent a trance people
[10:14.280 --> 10:22.400]  are like sleepwalking zombies that is your subconscious highly powerful brain
[10:22.400 --> 10:27.480]  the conscious is only the small narrow focus of that huge supercomputer we've
[10:27.480 --> 10:31.520]  all got between our ears those are not hyperbole it's out of the mouths of
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.680]  babes that's what's going on and I've done countless radio shows and had
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.600]  doctors on and shown the brainwaves lowering when you watch television or
[10:42.600 --> 10:46.360]  play video games for extended periods of time and I've read the DARPA documents
[10:46.360 --> 10:49.640]  on air where they talk about artificially lowering brainwaves and
[10:49.640 --> 10:53.440]  lowering consciousness with chemicals different wavelengths through
[10:53.440 --> 11:00.880]  television and biologicals as well it's a cocktail and DARPA admits that for
[11:00.880 --> 11:04.200]  at least a decade they've been testing this was on the Baltimore Sun ten years
[11:04.200 --> 11:11.000]  ago on cell towers testing carrier waves that they found can affect human
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.240]  emotion I mean this is this is admitted in the scholarly documents and has
[11:17.240 --> 11:21.440]  even come out in newspapers so we're not in Kansas anymore we're in a buck
[11:21.440 --> 11:28.640]  Rogers world here it is Department of Justice wants court to keep Google
[11:28.640 --> 11:34.600]  NSA partnership secret the NSA and CIA founded at 12 years ago on record I've
[11:34.600 --> 11:40.160]  had former top technology advisors from the CIA like Dr. Steele on to break it
[11:40.160 --> 11:54.840]  down I mean seven eight nine years ago we we covered this here is CNET news
[11:54.840 --> 12:02.560]  Google hires DARPA director Regina Duggan well they're just publicly merging
[12:02.560 --> 12:06.560]  see the New World Order is is on cloaking right now open world
[12:06.560 --> 12:10.760]  governments being announced open chemicals to be added to the water is
[12:10.760 --> 12:14.080]  being announced they're already doing it but now they're announcing it it's all
[12:14.080 --> 12:18.200]  happening I want you to understand this and and the problem is I study this
[12:18.200 --> 12:24.120]  obsessively probably let's not exaggerate I study probably seven hours a day I
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.480]  handle administrative things another three or four hours a day and then I'm
[12:28.480 --> 12:32.280]  on air three or four sometimes five hours a day well six seven hours a day
[12:32.280 --> 12:40.000]  I do interviews and every basic instinct I've got every selfish human
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.520]  survival mechanism that my supercomputer again hundreds of times more
[12:44.520 --> 12:50.760]  complex and and in deep than my focused conscious mind is telling me get your
[12:50.760 --> 13:03.080]  children get your wife evacuate run run run run and then sure on my YouTube
[13:03.080 --> 13:09.720]  videos on average we get about 98% support no one gets that on the web
[13:10.640 --> 13:16.840]  people are waking up but still I look at those who are making jokes about us and
[13:16.840 --> 13:20.440]  they think this is hyperbole they think this is a joke let me explain
[13:20.440 --> 13:25.240]  something to you the eye has not seen the ear is not heard I cannot articulate
[13:25.240 --> 13:35.280]  to you what we're on the verge of okay okay the globalists are all about
[13:35.280 --> 13:40.240]  denying reality living in a fantasy world and they're trying to get you to
[13:40.240 --> 13:46.360]  buy into it they want you to choose the matrix and the matrix is real we're not
[13:46.360 --> 13:51.400]  in tanks you know this batteries powering some system we are as the
[13:51.400 --> 13:56.280]  globalists call us human resources walking around powering and running
[13:56.280 --> 14:00.520]  their system they're not in full control yet this is not a total matrix yet but
[14:00.520 --> 14:04.120]  through the television through the video games through the bombardment on the
[14:04.120 --> 14:09.360]  street of the Times Square style system that's going in everywhere in Walmarts
[14:09.360 --> 14:14.600]  and malls this total bombardment of propaganda and subliminals the globalists
[14:14.600 --> 14:23.120]  themselves say they are inserting us into a hybrid system in fact it was
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.840]  written in the 70s by DARPA that by 2020 2025 they would begin the insertion
[14:29.840 --> 14:37.080]  of humans into tanks that see the matrix the matrix is only imitating what
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.280]  DARPA plans and I have shown you those chapters the Federation American
[14:42.280 --> 14:47.360]  Scientist in 2000 released it it had been declassified to them the Department
[14:47.360 --> 14:51.120]  of Defense requested it be reclassified and they said we're going to have a
[14:51.120 --> 14:57.760]  hive mind interconnected humans will choose to enter tanks and live see
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.640]  that's why in the 70s Philip K. Dick was living in San Francisco in other areas
[15:02.640 --> 15:06.960]  and hanging out with all these people from Silicon Valley and I've talked to
[15:06.960 --> 15:12.200]  people that manage the Philip K. Dick estate I'll leave it at that
[15:14.280 --> 15:19.080]  Philip K. Dick was not crazy. Philip K. Dick before he died was robbed his safe
[15:19.080 --> 15:23.000]  was robbed he had a big book coming out that was basically going to be nonfiction
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.280]  and was going to tell everybody what was going on PKD and you read all that you
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.160]  go man so much this is what's happening just like 1932 Brave New World is
[15:32.160 --> 15:37.280]  written by all this Huxley and it's got people shrunk down a servant class to
[15:37.280 --> 15:42.000]  about two feet tall it's got everybody drugged through the food and water and
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.560]  and and and the genetic engineers basically giving themselves near
[15:46.560 --> 15:49.960]  immortality and then genetically engineering the general public whether
[15:49.960 --> 15:56.400]  whether biological androids of course he then wrote before he died and spoke
[15:56.400 --> 15:59.800]  Huxley did it Berkeley and said this is actually our plan and even though I'm
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.600]  telling it to you you're not going to be able to escape it now Paul Watson just
[16:04.600 --> 16:07.360]  ran into government documents we just published more yesterday about the
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.560]  Rockefeller Foundation and all of this where they're openly saying that they're
[16:12.560 --> 16:18.600]  pushing ahead with the drugging of the water and all of it it's a Brave New
[16:18.600 --> 16:21.600]  World plan they said they're going to shrink us down within the next few
[16:21.600 --> 16:26.800]  generations to the little servant class now now it's questionable whether
[16:26.800 --> 16:30.640]  they're going to be able to implement this but the GMO that's fed to rodents
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.080]  does exactly what they're saying that they want to implement with this system
[16:35.080 --> 16:39.160]  and Watson's got an article coming out in a few hours on this subject with new
[16:39.160 --> 16:42.640]  documents that are public but no one's reported on just like they're teaching the
[16:42.640 --> 16:46.120]  bioethics is that sooner to start killing babies after birth even though
[16:46.120 --> 16:50.040]  they're totally healthy and I know when we first posted that article people
[16:50.040 --> 16:52.920]  thought it was satire and a joke even though we were listing the documents and
[16:52.920 --> 16:57.520]  three days later you saw it all over mainstream news folks this is all real
[16:57.520 --> 17:03.000]  okay this is all real most of us are already walking dead we've already been
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.600]  given lethal dosages of chemical and biological agents the next generation
[17:08.600 --> 17:13.280]  you're already seeing it is just going to be malformed addled mentally retarded
[17:13.280 --> 17:19.600]  cancer pediatric cancer that's already up over 20,000 percent general cancers
[17:19.600 --> 17:24.440]  up over 2,000 percent on average is just going to be epidemic most people you
[17:24.440 --> 17:30.400]  know we're going to die of cancer it's just it's total warfare that's why if
[17:30.400 --> 17:33.720]  they kill me I'm not even worried about it anymore it's just I mean I have I have
[17:33.720 --> 17:38.680]  reached a place of peace and I realize all we can do is try to inject sanity
[17:38.680 --> 17:53.680]  crazy mad scientist are running things and I am swimming in documentation and
[17:53.680 --> 17:59.160]  the globalist openly you can look this up brain waves are lower on average the
[17:59.160 --> 18:03.560]  general public is in a trance there's all sorts of narcoleptic disorders off
[18:03.560 --> 18:06.680]  the chart now because once the brain gets trained to go into a sleep phase
[18:06.680 --> 18:13.200]  it'll start sinking deeper got to stop watching television folks especially
[18:13.200 --> 18:16.880]  because even if you're watching a good show there can be a carrier wave over it
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.720]  I am 100% banning my children from even documentaries and computers now I have

[19:00.440 --> 19:05.760]  things like shrimp you look at the big studies that just the prozac runoff in

[24:16.360 --> 24:22.000]  it's not that people just aren't paying attention and walking into fountains
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.920]  walking into cars I was just looking at the statistics during the break off the
[24:26.920 --> 24:33.080]  charts in the Western world increase in pedestrian fatalities I was driving down
[24:33.080 --> 24:37.200]  Southwest Parkway one day and came up over a hill I was going about 65 miles
[24:37.200 --> 24:44.200]  an hour and it's also part of a reality-denying arrogance a bunch of ten
[24:44.200 --> 24:49.520]  speed riding you know bike riders were actually out in the road not on the
[24:49.520 --> 24:54.240]  shoulder they wanted to be in the road like it's theirs and I narrowly narrowly
[24:54.240 --> 24:57.440]  got out of the lane even though there was a car behind me slam my brakes on and
[24:57.440 --> 25:05.120]  shot behind the other car and they're getting killed every day every hour I
[25:05.120 --> 25:08.360]  mean the numbers are just hundreds of bike riders getting plowed a week and
[25:08.360 --> 25:13.000]  again pedestrians walking out in front of cars this is a phenomenon that's
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.920]  admitted but it's more than just getting mesmerized by texting while you're
[25:17.920 --> 25:25.760]  driving it's that the computer screen once you become synced with it there's
[25:25.760 --> 25:28.480]  different studies on the average computer screen or television depending on
[25:28.480 --> 25:31.900]  the flicker rate it might take 45 minutes the first time to go into a
[25:31.900 --> 25:36.200]  mesmerized state and lower your brainwaves and go into a sleep state but
[25:36.200 --> 25:40.000]  once you've done it it can take seconds you ever noticed children when they see
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.400]  a television on suddenly you can't get their attention even if firecrackers
[25:43.400 --> 25:47.360]  were going off in the room this is what we're talking about and this is on
[25:47.360 --> 25:52.560]  record I was led into the University of Texas psychology department now 10 years
[25:52.560 --> 25:56.760]  ago by one of the top people who will remain nameless and is no longer there
[25:56.760 --> 26:07.360]  has moved on to another facility even more elite and I was shown stuff all of
[26:07.360 --> 26:12.280]  it was DARPA funded every or department of defense same thing and the whole
[26:12.280 --> 26:21.320]  place was giant multi-million dollar labs on how to have subliminals to make
[26:21.320 --> 26:25.080]  women sexually aroused when they watch a commercial or how to have retina
[26:25.080 --> 26:31.200]  trackers when you're in a store shopping following your eye or how to face skin
[26:31.200 --> 26:34.760]  you when you enter a bar and you know they would tell you how many men were in
[26:34.760 --> 26:38.200]  a bar versus women now those apps are being rolled out on the streets and just
[26:38.200 --> 26:44.200]  all studying every little facet and monkeys chained down with wires in
[26:44.200 --> 26:48.000]  their brains you know these were TVs I could see you know the monkeys out at
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.120]  the base outside Austin just with flicker rate patterns hitting them testing
[26:52.120 --> 26:57.160]  brainwaves just huge facilities just full of monkeys with the tops of their
[26:57.160 --> 27:02.440]  skulls cut off with wires wired in I mean all on how to savagely take control
[27:02.440 --> 27:10.040]  of your mind and you now go into stores you talk to people they are under like
[27:10.040 --> 27:14.000]  an arrested development the program they've been downloaded with is like a
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.760]  happy goofy kind of Sesame Street for teenagers or adults and then this
[27:18.760 --> 27:24.280]  morning I'm gonna go to Watson here in a moment I was doing more research on
[27:24.280 --> 27:29.320]  Coney 2012 just because it's it's a modern Pentagon globalist sigh up for war
[27:29.320 --> 27:35.760]  and it's adults talking to adults college students and high schoolers going
[27:35.760 --> 27:42.560]  hi friendly nice see literally hopping around going have a screening in your
[27:42.560 --> 27:47.000]  area it's not threatening call it's nice it's fun all these pink colors green
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.320]  colors you know happy talking to people like their five-year-olds or really
[27:52.320 --> 27:57.200]  three-year-olds and that's what the new world order in PR voice all of it is and
[27:57.200 --> 28:01.640]  to watch these government operatives with with with a sinister gleam in their
[28:01.640 --> 28:05.000]  eye they can't hide that because my subconscious supercomputers on I'm like
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.480]  seeing every bit of it I'm like wow man they know it it's a giant army of
[28:10.480 --> 28:20.320]  technicians and then I see the results but but here's what's happening 9 out of
[28:20.320 --> 28:24.320]  10 reactors worldwide 400 plus are leaking radiation government just raises
[28:24.320 --> 28:28.520]  a level radiation what they say safe everything's starting to fall apart
[28:28.520 --> 28:33.040]  corruption's going wild the globalists have gone crazy they've been drinking the
[28:33.040 --> 28:38.960]  Kool-Aid as well and I'm here to tell you society is gonna go completely insane
[28:38.960 --> 28:43.400]  undoubtedly wars have already begun proxy wars and Iran have begun like we
[28:43.400 --> 28:48.320]  said they would and it's now admitted proxy wars in Libya Syria Uganda mass
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.000]  murder I mean it's admitted the UN is just murdering people in mass but it
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.960]  doesn't matter they have guys in pink and green you know trendy plaid shirts
[28:55.960 --> 29:00.440]  dancing around saying it's loving and so you talk to the public and they
[29:00.440 --> 29:05.440]  giggle back at you with this self-satisfied look the program the
[29:05.440 --> 29:10.240]  the conditioning they've been given is similar to have a three-year-old is
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.440]  throwing a fit and you go you know if it's a girl you're a princess you're a
[29:14.440 --> 29:18.720]  princess let's dress up like a princess they go princess it's that make-belief
[29:18.720 --> 29:22.560]  thing that's normal for small children to develop different roles in their
[29:22.560 --> 29:27.960]  mind but for adults so it's literally a child program that they're running in
[29:27.960 --> 29:31.960]  adults out there and the cops are following a tough guy program and
[29:31.960 --> 29:36.600]  they're all about following programming and I'm seeing it and now the
[29:36.600 --> 29:41.160]  programming the public is in such a sleep state they are walking out in front
[29:41.160 --> 29:45.120]  of traffic their bikes are driving out people are texting while driving I'm
[29:45.120 --> 29:48.000]  gonna talk to Watson about this when we get back but I'm telling you something
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.440]  begs about to happen we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[29:54.440 --> 29:58.040]  the GCN radio network

[31:00.400 --> 31:05.120]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[31:05.120 --> 31:08.680]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[31:08.680 --> 31:12.760]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[31:12.760 --> 31:16.280]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[31:16.280 --> 31:20.960]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[31:20.960 --> 31:25.440]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then

[32:03.520 --> 32:07.440]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[32:07.440 --> 32:11.680]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[32:11.680 --> 32:15.960]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[32:15.960 --> 32:20.320]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[32:20.320 --> 32:24.400]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[32:24.400 --> 32:28.960]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[32:28.960 --> 32:33.080]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[32:33.080 --> 32:37.080]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[32:37.080 --> 32:40.880]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[32:40.880 --> 32:43.600]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[32:43.600 --> 32:47.040]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[32:47.040 --> 32:52.280]  www dot my solar backup com that's my solar backup com remember the
[32:52.280 --> 33:03.800]  government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup com or call 1-877-327-0365
[33:22.320 --> 33:31.160]  the matrix is a system neo that system is our enemy but when you're inside you
[33:31.160 --> 33:40.120]  look around what do you see businessman teachers lawyers carpenters the very
[33:40.120 --> 33:44.960]  minds of the people we are trying to save but until we do these people are
[33:44.960 --> 33:51.400]  still part of that system and that makes them our enemy you have to understand
[33:51.400 --> 33:58.080]  most of these people are not ready to be unplugged and many of them are so
[33:58.080 --> 34:04.840]  inert so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect
[34:04.840 --> 34:10.280]  it and I would add still others even upon learning the truth will decide
[34:10.280 --> 34:15.880]  through fear to try to join with the system those are the people that are
[34:15.880 --> 34:21.360]  willfully ignorant I can't tell you how many media executives how many people
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.840]  when I tell them I don't want to be part of their system they cannot believe it
[34:25.840 --> 34:31.400]  I remember last year New York magazine had a quote by a Fox News executive
[34:31.400 --> 34:37.120]  saying Alex Jones wants to be on Fox but we don't want Alex Jones and implied
[34:37.120 --> 34:42.840]  I tried to get on Fox News you know what I just told Fox that I don't want to be
[34:42.840 --> 34:48.120]  part of Fox TV shows you've you've heard man Cal air say that you know he wanted
[34:48.120 --> 34:53.360]  me and Breitbart to be on a show with him and he's gonna have his show and you
[34:53.360 --> 34:56.680]  know I've said that I'm not gonna be I'm certainly not gonna fly there and be
[34:56.680 --> 35:02.960]  part of it I mean I could go on a show and say whatever I want if it was live
[35:02.960 --> 35:09.240]  off satellite but it's like I'm not seeking after that I'm not going to make
[35:09.240 --> 35:14.840]  a break with the system by being part of it I mean I'm tempted to quit this
[35:14.840 --> 35:22.480]  radio show and TV and everything and do one video a week just breaking down the
[35:22.480 --> 35:28.280]  matrix because that's all that matters now covering little side issues a
[35:28.280 --> 35:31.320]  little piece here a little piece there that isn't what matters let me explain
[35:31.320 --> 35:37.640]  something pediatric cancer from the 1940s is up over 20,000% go look up those
[35:37.640 --> 35:45.800]  rates 20,000% your average cancer is up by 2,000% since the late 40s early 50s
[35:45.800 --> 35:52.960]  go look it up breast cancer in the United States is exploding thousands of
[35:52.960 --> 35:56.680]  percentile and is the worst in the world and then I have all the documents
[35:56.680 --> 36:02.400]  where they said they would do this to us they are killing us they're killing our
[36:02.400 --> 36:10.800]  women and let me tell you something I can't be around network TV executives in
[36:10.800 --> 36:16.800]  their suits and prancing around trying to show off it makes me want to throw up
[36:16.800 --> 36:22.200]  I see police now pulling over and search people's cars I want to pull over and
[36:22.200 --> 36:26.240]  laugh at them oh you're gonna search somebody's cars for drugs when it's on
[36:26.240 --> 36:34.400]  record the criminals that run this government ship the drugs in
[36:37.440 --> 36:42.440]  rare cancers are exploding things that were once rare are now extremely
[36:42.440 --> 36:51.360]  common none of this window dressing matters do you get it none of it matters
[36:51.360 --> 36:57.720]  none of it we have a scientific elite that decided to have a total takeover
[36:57.720 --> 37:02.640]  of the entire biosphere of the planet and to wreck it in their own words so
[37:02.640 --> 37:06.360]  that they could patent it all and when you can't have children because of the
[37:06.360 --> 37:12.720]  heavy metals in the GMO and all the manipulation they say in the 30s that
[37:12.720 --> 37:21.600]  you would have to come to them to get genetic repair so that you could have
[37:21.600 --> 37:28.720]  children but then when you do that they're going to go in and alter it to
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.800]  make sure you're not aggressive or bad or you're removing traits that they say
[37:33.800 --> 37:42.200]  are a problem now expanding on all of this there's a 3000 year old symbol for
[37:42.200 --> 37:51.280]  medicine and it's two snakes intertwined with a staff in the middle they were
[37:51.280 --> 37:58.160]  writing about atomic bombs in 1900 HD Wells and others they were writing about
[37:58.160 --> 38:03.800]  DNA in the 20s decades before it was discovered there is an advanced
[38:03.800 --> 38:15.080]  technological civilization in the laboratory the laboratory that is beta
[38:15.080 --> 38:20.800]  tested and then rolled out the public I don't know how advanced the enemy is but
[38:20.800 --> 38:25.440]  in general terms they're 30 years advanced and you think of 30 years
[38:25.440 --> 38:30.200]  advanced that means AI computers I know in the late 70s they already had robot
[38:30.200 --> 38:35.600]  drones with DU Shabo meteor guns I have that from the former director of Star
[38:35.600 --> 38:41.680]  Wars on this show dr. Bob Bowman colonel Bowman imagine what else is out there
[38:41.680 --> 38:46.920]  they had space planes ready to do to decapitate all world leaders in one
[38:46.920 --> 38:51.440]  hour in the late 1970s
[38:51.440 --> 39:02.080]  the only hope we've got is realizing that we are in a false reality that's the
[39:02.080 --> 39:12.480]  only hope we've got I am thrilled when I reach millions of people every day but
[39:12.480 --> 39:18.080]  I'm also disgusted when I realize I have this giant platform that's growing and
[39:18.080 --> 39:24.400]  I'm not imparting the true knowledge properly to people and the answer to
[39:24.400 --> 39:29.280]  this is those of you that have good minds as well you need to really get bold
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.720]  and speak out because I'm going to tell you this is all accelerating technology
[39:33.720 --> 39:36.800]  is now doubling every year and on every two years soon it's going to be every
[39:36.800 --> 39:41.320]  month then every week then every day then every hour then every minute the
[39:41.320 --> 39:44.640]  globalist I have shown themselves even with advanced technology they're still
[39:44.640 --> 39:48.680]  just humans and they're wicked which means they have blind spots for empathy
[39:48.680 --> 39:52.400]  and understanding because being able to carry something out doesn't mean you
[39:52.400 --> 39:57.080]  have wisdom they have computers supposedly thinking a hundred steps
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.560]  ahead for them and they have an idiot savants that do that as well but I don't
[40:01.560 --> 40:04.560]  think they're integrating all that data and I know from the evidence I've seen
[40:04.560 --> 40:08.760]  they're endangering themselves no amount of underground bases no amount of off
[40:08.760 --> 40:17.720]  world space stations no amount of high-tech garbage is going to protect
[40:17.720 --> 40:26.640]  you guys from what you've turned loose you are collectively crazy I have
[40:26.640 --> 40:32.640]  accessed my common sense my ancestral genetic memories I have accessed the
[40:32.640 --> 40:38.200]  full spectrum data analysis anybody can do this under deep study and focus and
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.280]  let me tell you something I guarantee you they're leading us towards the
[40:42.280 --> 40:49.280]  destruction of all life on this planet we don't have long until mechanisms are
[40:49.280 --> 40:53.720]  triggered in this downward spiral that are going to lead to things that if God
[40:53.720 --> 41:01.640]  doesn't intervene no flesh would be left alive the Bible says the elites will
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.040]  run to the mountains under the mountains in the caves and beg the rocks to fall
[41:06.040 --> 41:08.600]  on their heads
[41:11.320 --> 41:15.760]  revelation says they traffic in the souls of men I never knew what that meant
[41:15.760 --> 41:18.720]  till I really researched the globalist they do that's what they're into they
[41:18.720 --> 41:24.120]  love screwing people up they love giving people false data they love seeing
[41:24.120 --> 41:28.960]  people under literal spells that's what it is a scientific spell when Coney 2012
[41:28.960 --> 41:34.880]  has these promo videos where they're going hi we're your friends oh and it's
[41:34.880 --> 41:39.680]  getting into being silly and foolish and we're gonna have a war to save the
[41:39.680 --> 41:44.000]  children and that's gonna be mass war and death with a bunch of weird pot
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.480]  bellies dancing around and you're like well that's stupid why do they do that
[41:47.480 --> 41:52.480]  no it's like it's it's been scientifically figured out that's how
[41:52.480 --> 41:56.000]  you destroy people I'm gonna play this later Paul Watson's been holding for
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.480]  like 30 minutes I just wanted to get him on to talk to him and by the end of the
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.960]  show he's got this article coming out that I'm gonna get to yet but I mean
[42:03.960 --> 42:06.960]  when you've read thousands of these documents no kidding over the last 17
[42:06.960 --> 42:09.920]  years where there's hundreds of them about how they're gonna kill everybody
[42:09.920 --> 42:12.640]  once the world government's in place how they're putting the poison in the
[42:12.640 --> 42:19.040]  water the lithium the prozacs variants how the public's mesmerized how
[42:19.040 --> 42:29.960]  DARPA CIA run Google and I just hope all you people out there who who are
[42:29.960 --> 42:34.440]  running this system I hope you enjoy yourselves because you're not just gonna
[42:34.440 --> 42:39.400]  destroy the general public you are guaranteed to destroy yourselves 100%
[42:39.400 --> 42:46.160]  and we need to turn back now this this needs to stop right now now I'm gonna go
[42:46.160 --> 42:54.400]  to Watson you had to be there and I called Watson about this I'll eat my
[42:54.400 --> 43:02.520]  house out in the country I'm driving in towards 290 and on a road where people
[43:02.520 --> 43:05.800]  drive between 55 and 70 depending on which area of the road it is different
[43:05.800 --> 43:10.320]  speed limits people began slamming on their brakes in the middle of the
[43:10.320 --> 43:17.320]  highway to then turn across the medians almost crashing into traffic not once
[43:17.320 --> 43:24.680]  not twice but three times in a space of about six miles I would then notice with
[43:24.680 --> 43:29.520]  my eagle eyes that I still think God he said 2015 vision is 2020 now God as I
[43:29.520 --> 43:33.480]  lose my vision I just it's terrible I was able to notice each time they were
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.000]  all on cell phones they had cell phones in front of them while driving like
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.080]  psycho maniacs I called Watson and I said these people are in a trance we do
[43:42.080 --> 43:46.400]  more articles on the study showing up the public in a trance these new neural
[43:46.400 --> 43:52.840]  interface TV programs and 3D and all the stuff they're getting us ready for like
[43:52.840 --> 43:59.720]  I have some of the articles here that I had the guys print how the how the new
[43:59.720 --> 44:03.240]  video games are going to interface with the human brain like I just had them
[44:03.240 --> 44:06.720]  here in my stack but I guess more stuff's been brought in so I don't have it
[44:06.720 --> 44:12.440]  in front of me and the point is that I'm driving and I call Watson and I tell
[44:12.440 --> 44:16.560]  him about this and he says no I'm seeing it to my way everybody in the office is
[44:16.560 --> 44:19.240]  saying they see it you know they go in shops everybody's like in zombie mode
[44:19.240 --> 44:23.680]  people can't even talk they'll have this little giggling burbling like like
[44:23.680 --> 44:27.360]  three-year-old thing because they're in imaginary world that's what a trance is
[44:27.360 --> 44:32.360]  a spell that's just an ancient term for scientific manipulation a mind game
[44:32.360 --> 44:36.280]  hypnotizing somebody there it is Sony patents techniques of beaming info in
[44:36.280 --> 44:43.560]  the brain not just audio that's Reuters of course that was five years ago it's
[44:43.560 --> 44:48.240]  now been implemented and so each little upgrade of the computers gets you deeper
[44:48.240 --> 44:52.280]  into the control system until you just become quote a wirehead that Philip K
[44:52.280 --> 44:57.160]  Dick wrote about 30 years ago where that they just wire you in and there's so
[44:57.160 --> 45:02.800]  much pleasure from being wired in and the elites wrote 70 80 years ago about
[45:02.800 --> 45:07.080]  having surrogates you biological androids that they have a computer
[45:07.080 --> 45:10.040]  connection to actually go out and then the globalists live in their little
[45:10.040 --> 45:13.400]  tanks and I'm not saying this is going to happen but this is what they're
[45:13.400 --> 45:18.720]  trying to set up this is what the loons geniuses as they are they envision this
[45:18.720 --> 45:23.800]  a hundred years ago and are bringing it to fruition and they're willing to wreck
[45:23.800 --> 45:29.320]  the biosphere wreck every plant and animal species human DNA so that you've
[45:29.320 --> 45:33.920]  got to go to them to be able to have children they want to play gone and I'm
[45:33.920 --> 45:38.480]  driving and as right as I get on 290 it's before they have them the medium
[45:38.480 --> 45:48.000]  there before it rises up it's three lane you know there's routinely bicyclers
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.920]  that just come right out in 70 mile an hour traffic now pedestrians I see them
[45:51.920 --> 45:55.080]  just walking out people are getting killed everywhere they're in trances they
[45:55.080 --> 45:58.840]  don't have regular self-preservation mechanism the globalists have turned it
[45:58.840 --> 46:03.400]  off electronically and chemically psychologically and spiritually it all
[46:03.400 --> 46:14.520]  ties together I see this woman driving a dark gold kind of bronze those little
[46:14.520 --> 46:19.760]  hybrid cars these one of the Ford's the police listing will know because she had
[46:19.760 --> 46:24.880]  the wreck and she shot in the other way to trap people stopped I pulled over for
[46:24.880 --> 46:29.200]  a minute but went on because aid was rendered and I need to get to the office
[46:29.200 --> 46:34.160]  but the point is I'm driving just hang up with Watson and I'm trying to keep
[46:34.160 --> 46:39.240]  back as everybody's driving like psychos and I see this woman are radically
[46:39.240 --> 46:42.720]  coming out of the slow lane into the middle lane and cars getting back and I
[46:42.720 --> 46:46.120]  go I bet she's texting I want to be able to tell people if she because I just saw
[46:46.120 --> 46:49.040]  three cars slam on their brakes and I saw the two of them were texting when I
[46:49.040 --> 46:52.080]  get in the medium they pull over and still be you know slamming their break
[46:52.080 --> 46:55.960]  I mean you know ready to die ready to have their backs broken just no connection
[46:55.960 --> 47:00.520]  to reality and just like the shrimp that end up getting on Prozac from runoff
[47:00.520 --> 47:03.680]  and swim up to the fish to be eaten or to the birds just right up to birds to be
[47:03.680 --> 47:12.080]  eaten they just don't care bit money she was on some type of Prozac and she
[47:12.080 --> 47:16.080]  starts going like this so I pull up to see just like I saw about a year ago
[47:16.080 --> 47:21.520]  driving into Port Aransas to take my kids fishing I saw a giant gas truck
[47:21.520 --> 47:26.000]  natural gas in two lanes driving like a maniac like it had 18 gallons of Jack
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.400]  Daniels and I pulled up and sure enough he was watching a video with it in front
[47:30.400 --> 47:36.280]  of him that's how addicted they are he's driving with a full load so I could see
[47:36.280 --> 47:43.040]  the axles down of natural gas natural gas truck and he's got it in front of him
[47:43.040 --> 47:50.480]  and he's all out of the lanes now again that's how mesmerized they are by the
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.380]  computer screen about TV so this guy
[47:54.380 --> 48:01.520]  we're going to Watson was doing that this woman I pull up there she is looking
[48:01.520 --> 48:06.080]  and texting and with one arm going like this going 70 miles an hour getting up
[48:06.080 --> 48:12.440]  on to 290 and I back off to observe I'm about to take my camera up even though
[48:12.440 --> 48:15.400]  that's not really safe but I'm conscious and driving and show some video to and
[48:15.400 --> 48:22.680]  she goes boom cutting across three lanes straight and as I see her right in
[48:22.680 --> 48:28.240]  front of me still looking at the screen in zombie land in a mesmerized sleep
[48:28.240 --> 48:32.800]  walking state shooting across the grass median because she'd been dead going 70
[48:32.800 --> 48:36.960]  if she'd hit dividers that were just a hundred yards up as you go up shooting
[48:36.960 --> 48:41.160]  in front of two concrete trucks spinning around and then gently slamming up
[48:41.160 --> 48:48.040]  against the wall and the car stopped to help her she had already turned in front
[48:48.040 --> 48:51.960]  of three lanes of traffic
[48:56.360 --> 49:00.440]  they have no so no wonder they don't care there's about to be a war with Iran
[49:00.440 --> 49:03.480]  of course they tell the military go ahead and use DU even though it's going
[49:03.480 --> 49:06.440]  to kill them of course they raise the level of radiation thousands of times
[49:06.440 --> 49:11.720]  and say it's safe of course I mean this is a public being murdered by chemical
[49:11.720 --> 49:15.760]  and biological weapons total tyranny way of life being destroyed everything
[49:15.760 --> 49:19.480]  falling apart troops are going crazy going into villages and killing 16
[49:19.480 --> 49:25.100]  people in their houses for fun that we are a nation in a coma we are under
[49:25.100 --> 49:28.840]  mind control and you're going to start seeing more of it I'm predicting now
[49:28.840 --> 49:32.040]  you're going to see more pedestrians walking out in front of cars and walking
[49:32.040 --> 49:35.720]  off cliffs and more people wrecking everywhere because the public is going
[49:35.720 --> 49:39.760]  to go completely into zombieville I predict you're going to start seeing
[49:39.760 --> 49:43.000]  people not going to work and just staying in their houses they're already
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.640]  wire heads they're already plugged in Watson I know you're working on the
[49:45.640 --> 49:49.600]  article while you sit there on Skype waiting but did I call you this morning
[49:49.600 --> 49:52.400]  and say that cars were slamming on their brakes and driving like psychopaths
[49:52.400 --> 49:58.480]  everywhere that's right Alex and I mean there was another one recently wasn't
[49:58.480 --> 50:03.440]  there there was a surveillance camera footage above a train platform and a
[50:03.440 --> 50:08.280]  woman lets go of a baby stroller and it rolls across the platform towards the
[50:08.280 --> 50:12.800]  tracks and then there's a guy walking past looking at his cell phone he looks
[50:12.800 --> 50:16.920]  up at the baby stroller but just lets it roll past him onto the tracks and the
[50:16.920 --> 50:21.840]  they managed to save the baby by about 10 seconds before it got hit by a train so
[50:21.840 --> 50:25.560]  you see those kind of stories nearly every day now with this zombified
[50:25.560 --> 50:31.360]  population and and and we're not using zombified as a term folks the brainwaves
[50:31.360 --> 50:35.040]  Paul I want to go big on this I want to get all the data together that we've
[50:35.040 --> 50:38.840]  covered over the years and really show people scientifically to the scientific
[50:38.840 --> 50:42.440]  elite that isn't totally controlled and say is this really what you want because
[50:42.440 --> 50:46.600]  so they can control us they've zombified the public because they've got to turn it
[50:46.600 --> 50:51.200]  up high enough to like really control those that would be resisting them so
[50:51.200 --> 50:55.120]  only the very few can break through the programming but in that by doing that I
[50:55.120 --> 51:01.600]  mean it is just stay there run talk about when we come back you don't need me to
[51:01.600 --> 51:06.800]  tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis everyone can feel it we know a
[51:06.800 --> 51:11.840]  tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those
[51:11.840 --> 51:18.440]  who love darkness bondage and enslavement yes my friends evil is rising
[51:18.440 --> 51:24.080]  but take heart for every action there is an equal and oppositely action recently
[51:24.080 --> 51:29.080]  new world order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war we
[51:29.080 --> 51:33.760]  are in an information war and we are losing that war the globalist are
[51:33.760 --> 51:39.640]  scared they've overreached the future of the info war is in your hands join
[51:39.640 --> 51:45.520]  prisonplanet.tv download the thousands of special video reports ebooks and more
[51:45.520 --> 51:49.320]  and get them out to everyone you know continue to spread the word about the
[51:49.320 --> 51:53.960]  broadcast on YouTube Facebook Twitter and every other globalist propaganda
[51:53.960 --> 51:58.720]  platform we are going to use their system against them the info war now goes
[51:58.720 --> 52:03.520]  into high gear what is the most abundant resource on earth water it's
[52:03.520 --> 52:06.960]  essential for sustaining life but it's not always the most available when

[54:25.160 --> 54:37.640]  the rustic chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun I walk
[54:37.640 --> 54:42.800]  Paul Watson has gotten his article up and I know he's gonna add some of the
[54:42.800 --> 54:46.640]  news clips where they're promoting lithium in the water but here's the
[54:46.640 --> 54:51.760]  Atlantic big establishment liberal publication how engineering the human
[54:51.760 --> 54:57.520]  body could combat climate change and they go on to say the elite want to add
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.760]  chemicals and biologicals to our food and water to make us small little
[55:01.760 --> 55:05.840]  creatures elven creatures to not hurt the earth and how they're gonna ban
[55:05.840 --> 55:11.840]  eating meat and use opera condition you totally control us and again I tell you
[55:11.840 --> 55:14.920]  about the stuff 10 years ago that was in all the policy reports you'd laugh at
[55:14.920 --> 55:19.000]  me now it's out in the open and you are being engineered by the flicker rate by
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.960]  the TV I think even with my shows just because the nature of it everybody
[55:23.960 --> 55:29.680]  should pretty much not watch television but listen to it you definitely need to
[55:29.680 --> 55:34.320]  not watch mainstream television and because that's where it's really a full
[55:34.320 --> 55:39.280]  of propaganda not just with the flicker rate but the actual message need to read
[55:39.280 --> 55:45.160]  more with old-fashioned books and we need to realize we're in a fight for human
[55:45.160 --> 55:48.920]  consciousness more now than ever Paul I know that we've said this before but
[55:48.920 --> 55:53.960]  when I say it's an epiphany it hit me this is the battle this is everything
[55:53.960 --> 55:58.560]  and this is what the globalists are all about you brought up people now more and
[55:58.560 --> 56:02.280]  more all over the world seeing a woman bleeding the death a cop run over by a
[56:02.280 --> 56:05.400]  car and they're not helping people that's because the globalist have
[56:05.400 --> 56:10.960]  engineered not resisting tyranny not resisting threats I tell the story of the
[56:10.960 --> 56:14.440]  people not helping the woman choke into death and I had to push him out of the
[56:14.440 --> 56:19.560]  way and and they were just saying 911 911 and she would have died I mean it
[56:19.560 --> 56:25.200]  literally they've turned people into jellyfish cattle Paul Watson but they
[56:25.200 --> 56:30.080]  they've got a solution for us Alex it's the former ecological enhancement of
[56:30.080 --> 56:36.720]  empathy and altruism they're gonna give us drugs which influence our behavior so
[56:36.720 --> 56:42.280]  that we're more environmentally aware according to this New York bioethics
[56:42.280 --> 56:46.560]  professor who's come out with this paper but it hasn't worked very well because
[56:46.560 --> 56:49.720]  they put sodium fluoride in there and the other things to reduce fertility in
[56:49.720 --> 56:56.200]  Domestown I mean I I guess more is needed well they say that basically the
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.400]  the biggest problem is climate change and to combat climate change we need
[57:00.400 --> 57:06.640]  quote biomedical modifications of humanity mm-hmm and so of course this is
[57:06.640 --> 57:11.160]  not going to apply to the elite just as the the plandopolis vision for the
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.760]  future showed you know all the slaves weren't allowed to drive cars only the
[57:14.760 --> 57:19.560]  rich people were so it only applies to the surfs obviously but they're gonna
[57:19.560 --> 57:25.600]  basically inject children with embryos to make them small like you said in
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.560]  brave new world at the beginning where it's all this subclass race of tiny
[57:29.560 --> 57:34.920]  dwarf like people but it's for the good of the planet and so that's why I
[57:34.920 --> 57:38.920]  honestly said that was the plan his brother founded UNESCO which is the
[57:38.920 --> 57:44.280]  policy center for Gen 21 but now it's trendy apparently it's trendy now and
[57:44.280 --> 57:49.360]  it's it's for the planet so the moral equivalency of that trumps the moral
[57:49.360 --> 57:56.320]  equivalency of genetically engineering babies in labs apparently that's that's
[57:56.320 --> 58:01.440]  trendy now and liberal and touchy feely not a scientific dictatorship according
[58:01.440 --> 58:09.080]  to this professor so I mean yeah talking about giving people patches or drugs which
[58:09.080 --> 58:15.560]  make them adverse to meet so of course I'll completely collapse a massive part
[58:15.560 --> 58:18.840]  of the economy but it's again it's for the good of the planet but they're not
[58:18.840 --> 58:22.960]  drugging us now even though they've done associated press water studies in all
[58:22.960 --> 58:26.360]  the major cities and find levels of drugs that shouldn't be there even from
[58:26.360 --> 58:30.680]  runoff like serotonin reuptake inhibitor and it's not one particular
[58:30.680 --> 58:35.320]  brand or molecule it's the general base generic version they're already
[58:35.320 --> 58:39.800]  drugging your water ladies and gentlemen
[58:42.040 --> 58:48.800]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[59:12.680 --> 59:18.240]  no useless dyes perfumes deodorants or antibacterials your risk is the hundreds
[59:18.240 --> 59:22.840]  of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes itching sores and a
[59:22.840 --> 59:26.560]  terrorating clothing called lint if you want something better if you want

[59:57.880 --> 01:00:09.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:17.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:25.000]  Alex Jones so let's be clear I've got Fox News Japanese TV no exaggeration
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.320]  hundreds of University UN Club of Rum documents saying in the 40s 50s 60s 70s
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.880]  we're gonna drug the water to reduce population all this stuff they've been
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.320]  caught doing it they've been the UN's been caught adding sterilants to vaccines
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:46.680]  you name it and now the Atlantic establishment publication reports it
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.480]  like it's the greatest things in sliced bread how they're gonna force drug you
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:55.960]  and change your embryos by law under a socialist health care system death
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.560]  panels are all admitted they're in the media saying what's wrong with killing
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:05.840]  children up to age three and old people and then I see some Coney 2012 promo that
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.440]  they did for having showings of their film about invading Africa and how great
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.480]  the UN is for some just cut-out boogeyman who no one even knows where Africa's at
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:21.080]  and they start drooling on there hopping around like it's Sesame Street
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:26.040]  talking to adults like their three-year-olds and then I see adults
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.040]  clicking into the child programming and like getting off on it man I mean this
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.720]  is hardcore mind control that were under and like I said suddenly there's
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:40.000]  just wrecks everywhere people walking out in front of cars people texting while
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.120]  they're driving with it one thing to check a text while you're driving I mean
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.280]  we're talking about driving watching videos driving tech driving just running
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:55.120]  off the road everywhere psychopaths Paul what is happening to people man I
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.080]  mean how much worse is this gonna get I think the studies have shown that the
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.640]  internet is literally rewiring people's brains so if you think about those
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:11.040]  pus-filled pods that in the matrix where people are trapped in that's the
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.680]  equivalent of what we've got today with the ubiquitous nature of wireless
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.000]  internet and text messaging which is why we get all these stories that you
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.560]  talked about you know in the last segment so we're literally the brains
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.880]  are being rewired our attention spans are being reduced and that's why
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:32.680]  propaganda is so much more crude and childlike because that's the most
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.880]  successful product form of propaganda because people don't concentrate they
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:41.640]  don't scratch below the surface they've got tiny attention spans and that's why
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.800]  they're coming play things for the elite well listen I want you to come back and
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.960]  cover the article itself but in the brief time we have here Paul I am now
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.840]  watching the propaganda being shown to college students and people and it's all
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.320]  the same it's people in in in Stepford wife bright colors with a feminine man
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:04.680]  literally prancing around saying I'm non-threatening there's no work here
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:10.200]  we're having fun let's have a war and then and and and you can see they're
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.960]  all crazed-eyed operatives it's so crude but because they're attacking an
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.080]  unconscious jellyfish population of zombies they're following them and for
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.280]  those that are of us that are awake it's it's cartoonish I mean it's it's like
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.480]  it's insane I mean what are the elites gonna do just they're gonna run around
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.280]  bathing and radiation and GMO to I mean just because they're conscious of this
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:40.680]  it makes it okay I don't know it's amazing but I mean the Coney 2012 thing
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:47.240]  if you look into that business because that's what it is Bill Gates in this 80
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.720]  percent or more of the money that comes in goes directly to their expenses it's
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.200]  worse than something like the Red Cross I mean hardly any of the money actually
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.520]  goes to people suffering in Uganda and that's why they chose the guy that's
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.760]  probably been dead for five six years it's just totally made up yeah I mean
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.680]  and then there's people on YouTube Ugandan citizens who are saying what
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.880]  are you talking about this nobody even talks about this guy in Uganda anymore
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.880]  he's not being in the country for six years he's probably dead and our main
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.400]  problem now is you know AIDS poverty all this but then literally people are
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.040]  attacking us who have trendy hair and bandanas saying we're horrible for not
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.800]  wanting to get Coney and they're literally in trendy outfits I mean they
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:38.120]  took an army of zombie trendies the children by clicking like on Twitter or
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.720]  Facebook that's what you threaten when you point out the hoax they don't like
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.600]  it and then meanwhile Angelina Jolie who admitted he's into the occult and
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:52.400]  worships death and all this is running around worshiping all these wars and I
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.720]  mean she's a war criminal people are like why she a war criminal oh man we're
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.560]  in trouble folks folks Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning

[01:06:52.560 --> 01:07:00.800]  five star soap dot com a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.160]  into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that was still starving and my
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.480]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.920]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.160]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.160]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.960]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:11.320]  lines the information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network I
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.240]  made the discovery
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:23.200]  about 14 15 years ago that the whole world government was not based on money
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.080]  or even power but on a final revolution to set up planetary government cut off
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.960]  resources have resource wars and then exterminate the majority of the
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:37.600]  population mid-level minions are told 80 to 90% are going to be killed top
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.760]  globalist documents we've read on air say 99.9% of all humans will be
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:53.120]  exterminated then the one-tenth of 1% will merge with machines and populate
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:58.960]  the known universe now I'm not saying any of that's real but that's what all of
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:05.000]  the elites from Ray Kurzweil right through the UN officials all are
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.840]  obsessed with and they write cover stories and wired magazine like why the
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.600]  future doesn't need us with Bill Joy I've talked about 500 times or more
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.760]  saying I went to an elite meeting of 200 top internet company and software
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.680]  company and technology company owners and all we talked about was do we kill
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:27.440]  everybody or do we let everybody just play games and you know basically get
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.840]  mesmerized by entertainment and and just keep breeding or do we just reduce
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.840]  population what do we do and the consensus is kill everybody I mean
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:44.320]  that's what's frustrating this is all public and I take it real personal
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.440]  people around me are dead and dying of cancer and I know those numbers are off
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.600]  the charts thousands of percentile points I take it real personal when I
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:58.280]  know that they're attacking children and that pediatric cancer once unknown is
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:04.680]  now epidemic I take it real personal when I find out that they for at least
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:11.160]  50 years have been adding chemicals to our food and water I take it real
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.440]  personal and and here's the big epiphany that I want to get to for people out
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:23.640]  there okay here's the point that I really really want to get across to folks
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:31.720]  and it's this the public is becoming more and more unconscious the brain waves
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.640]  are lowering into a sleep state across the board that's not debated all the
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.040]  technologies being rolled out are admittedly virtual false reality systems
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.080]  that program your brain and interface and project sound into your middle ear
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:52.920]  and interface directly with your neurons outside of the eyeballs which
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:58.000]  themselves are brain stocks you want to be they say the eyes one of the soul the
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.160]  eyes during embryonic development grow out of the brain the eyes are brain
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:11.720]  tissue brain sensors sight sensors the nose olfactory direct connection to the
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:19.560]  brain direct nerve into the brain taste same deal touch nerves all going back
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.760]  into your brain they're programming you that's like a wireless connection when
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:30.080]  you're watching television and very wicked hateful people are in control now
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.520]  I'm going to integrate the epiphany here and then go to your calls I know that
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:37.120]  you're and we've already seen this you're going to see more automobile
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:43.680]  accidents you're going to see more texting accidents bike riders running
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.640]  into people until by law everything is going to be robotically controlled with
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.800]  the DARPA run Google cars that are already being legalized nationwide
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.520]  worldwide the genetics are going to be so in the damage you're going to have to
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:58.000]  go to the elites to be able to get government authorization to have
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.480]  children and then they're going to go in and change the embryo to be more
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.600]  subservient to the system by the way I told you that over a decade ago they're
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.680]  now announcing it in the news that that's what they're going to do with
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:14.600]  infertility that's engineered same thing with the GMO of the crops it is a
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:20.960]  diabolical plan beyond any science fiction you could ever imagine and it's
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.880]  happening you're about to see humanity the family everything completely
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:31.840]  degenerate and then you're going to see fleets of robot drones and ground
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.200]  to combat robots well you're going to see bureaucrat bots they already admit
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.080]  the drones robot drones are scanning the farms not allowed to build a barn not
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.640]  allowed to dig a pond not allowed to harvest your crops not allowed to have
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.200]  dust they're going to have robot trucks already all the postal service systems
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.280]  are having robot systems put on them that that snoop for dust and stuff around
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.440]  your farm your bureaucrats everywhere automated systems of tattling because
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.840]  you see they have to get rid of due process because when you get rid of due
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.680]  process you can automate everything due process the courts as corrupt as they
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.760]  are are going to hold up all this red light cameras violate the law it's not
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.160]  a sworn officer giving you the citation there's not a court hearing it's a
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:15.720]  fraud they don't care I was reading we're one Illinois town it's going to get
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.600]  thousands of red light cameras I'm reading we're all schools now the
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.000]  feds are saying have to get cameras in them because there's an epidemic of
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.440]  teachers raping children you see the teachers their pedophiles can't even
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.680]  control themselves now people that are bike riders don't even care they just
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.560]  come out into 70 mile an hour traffic having no idea that they could be killed
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.120]  because they're cut off from reality people have had their survival mechanism
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:51.280]  neutralized and so the military is gonna launch wars they can't win the elite
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.440]  are going crazy I mean I've seen statistics of Rockefeller and Rothschild
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.720]  kids the suicides the death I mean it's all cursed it's all just going to
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:05.600]  Hades you're going to see total disintegration I mean I know it now it is
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.920]  just going to get crazier and wilder and nuttier Paul Watson you got the force
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:13.680]  we got a break I got you on here to cover the article bioethicist professor
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.000]  drug the population into accepting green world order that's an info wars.com
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.480]  three weeks ago you posted the article where they openly in prestigious
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.800]  bioethics journal are calling for killing old people and babies up to age three
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:30.120]  the government will decide people thought that we made that up even though
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.080]  there were links to the prestigious journal this is in the Atlantic how
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.760]  engineering the human body could combat climate change tell folks about this
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.640]  article and what you think about the point I'm announcing here today well
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.160]  basically this Atlantic piece announces the fact that they want to
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:52.440]  chemically castrate free will but they say don't worry it'll be voluntary and
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:58.160]  not coercive just like not vaccinating your children is voluntary but as we
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.800]  know if you don't vaccinate your children the state the medical
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.760]  establishment harasses you people have been refused treatment CPS sent to
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.200]  people's houses if they refuse to vaccinate their children so they say
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.480]  oh yeah be voluntary but you know if you opt out of it you'll be harassed to the
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.480]  end of your days so they talk about making people a verse to meet they talk
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.760]  about by giving them drugs they talk about pharmacologically enhancing
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.760]  empathy so people will donate to specific charities of course if you
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.800]  follow that to its logical conclusion that means you can manipulate them to
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.960]  do anything through drugs they talk about injecting babies with embryos to
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:44.280]  make them grow smaller basically they're saying we're gonna give you a choice it's
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.280]  not the one-child policy it's a it's a more flexible version of that you can
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:57.640]  either have one normal child three enhanced as in made smaller tiny children
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.920]  or two medium-sized children so they're basically creating the framework where
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:05.800]  you have to choose one of these options as you said it's you know it's the state
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:11.000]  coming in and deciding how you give birth what kind of children you give birth to
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.640]  it's the one-child policy and as we've documented before you know lithium in
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.920]  the water supply has been promulgated through the media of course Obama's
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.400]  White House science stars John P. Holdren has advocated sterilizing people
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:31.240]  forcibly to reduce global population again in the name of saving the planet
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:35.560]  back then it was against you know the coming ice age that would destroy the
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:39.520]  earth now that's flipped over to global warming and now it's flipped over again
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.760]  to overpopulation which is a complete myth so again it's the scientific
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:49.240]  dictatorship wrapped in this trendy liberal touchy-feely package and sold
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.640]  as technological progress and advancement when in fact it's it's the
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:59.720]  very essence of authoritarian plandopolis society a technocratic elite
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.680]  dictating to us how we live our lives where whereas they're completely exempt
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.960]  well there's another article where Al Gore calls for a global nerd spring to
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.880]  force carbon taxes and all this and that's what it is it's like this new
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:18.240]  culture of being trendy is being stupid giggling arrested development weak
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.640]  unmanly and giggling and wearing pink and green you know the real trendy
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:29.520]  colors and prancing around and then supporting wars and feeling powerful and
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:36.400]  Al Gore actually is saying this now it's like armies of willfully pathetic
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:43.120]  dumb chumps well it's it's proven more successful hasn't it getting an army of
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:47.880]  Twitterers and Facebook people behind a war I mean it worked with Libya when the
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.720]  left spent months and months wailing about we need a no-fly zone over Libya
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.840]  overnight it turned into a bombardment now we've got the left again pushing for
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.960]  a war on Syria through these fake propaganda activists that are out in the
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:07.520]  media and again with this cone attempt 2012 thing you know same deal again so
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:11.960]  it's it's proven more successful than just you know pulling off a false flag
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:19.360]  or preemptive warfare the modern form of warfare is this fake color revolution
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:26.480]  style that Obama and the people who pull his strings are perfected well you're
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.680]  right Paul and you know that's why I said arresting you know arrest Angelina
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:38.200]  Joe Lee and like 5% of people it's got like 95 98% likes on these videos they're
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.600]  like are you kidding you know it's just her idea well Joseph Goebbels was putting
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.640]  out ideas she is an official UN envoy everywhere pushing for the Libya attacks
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:53.440]  Syria Uganda you know arrest Coney in vage she knows what she's doing and you
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.240]  know it's time to call their bluff the UN is murder incorporated involved in
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.560]  every evil you can imagine including extermination in Uganda and I'm sick of
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:09.000]  some chicken neck nobody ugly scumbag piece of trash drughead garbage up
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.920]  there telling me how great war is I'm calling her out I'm calling the Emperor
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:18.000]  has no clothes Paul and the evidence is that it's starting to work because there's
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.360]  been a massive backlash the Coney frauds have been forced to disable the
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.920]  comments on their YouTube channel they've been forced to put out this video
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:30.720]  clarifying the fight that people have found out they're a business empire that
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:36.240]  spends 80 plus percent of the income on their own travel expenses and staff like
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:41.560]  Red Cross and these other fake charities so I mean they're now on the run and the
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:46.800]  backlash is very much in evident with this Coney 2012 fraud so that proves
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.240]  again that we can hide their platforms and throw them back in their face I
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:55.960]  agree good job Paul they are globalists crime syndicate Empire pushing trash

[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:10.360]  I'm gonna be honest with you here on this 13th day of March 2012 on this
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:18.000]  Tuesday I've really studied the global elite and I have I've tried to really
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.160]  discover reality and and I would hear people like Greg Paulist when I first
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.000]  was interviewing him like 12 13 years ago say no the elite are not in control
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.960]  they're out of control it's a bunch of different combines stealing and robbing
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:35.480]  from each other and I would disagree with that I would say no there is an
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.960]  organized system but now I realize it's both they've got an organized system to
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.040]  rob us and they sit around their commission tables like on the Godfather
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.800]  literally deciding on different things they're gonna allow and in different
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.920]  scams they're gonna run and they also cheat each other so so they're good at
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:58.000]  grabbing and stealing and stomping on a little guy and dumbing everybody down but
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.400]  they're not good it actually controlling themselves and I mean a great
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:06.920]  example of this was eight nine months ago radiation levels different isotopes
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:11.360]  go off the chart so the EPA raised one isotope a hundred and something thousand
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.720]  times others a couple thousand times you can see the whole list you know this
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.400]  isotopes raised 2,500 times what they say safe you know we're not gonna test the
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:29.440]  milk now it just shows that the elite are crazy I mean they and that's even
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.800]  scarier than taking their in control Greg I want to get into ten years at
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:40.360]  Berfukashima or one year at Berfukashima ten years and I want to get into you know
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.480]  the Iran war and the economy but is it just me or or are things going
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:50.880]  completely insane I mean I was covering the last hour and a half or so suddenly
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.280]  they admit pedestrian accidents are up people are walking in front of cars I
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.680]  saw cars everywhere wrecking this morning while they were texting of the
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:03.320]  public's disconnected the leader disconnected what's going on Greg well
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:12.080]  actually yeah we we cut his short his interview short I think that they know
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.080]  pretty well what they're doing yeah there's always an internal fight between
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:22.080]  elites and in fact you know and obviously I go ahead yeah we there's
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.240]  always a fight between the elites for example we see it now between the
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.160]  billionaires behind Obama and the billionaires behind Romney as we discussed
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:36.440]  before the top billionaires behind Romney or Paul the vulture singer John
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:44.600]  Paulson Bill Koch behind Barack Obama as Penny Pritzker and of course the the
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.920]  banking elite of the major commercial and white shoe banks investment banks
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:55.600]  like JP Morgan is behind Obama and Goldman Sachs has been both sides but
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:00.120]  mostly on Obama's side and what you have in other words why are the wire guys
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:05.040]  like singer Paulson who people may not know of these are vulture investors these
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:10.000]  are hedge fund managers these are these are multi multi billionaires Paulson
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.120]  made nearly four billion dollars in a single year more than any other
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:17.400]  American has ever made in history maybe anyone has made in history in a single
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.000]  year basically betting against and pushing the mortgage market over a
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.440]  cliff there's a fight between these groups but you know they agree on some
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.320]  basic principles that one group will get your money or the other group will but
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:37.200]  you won't I mean I'm laughing but you know that's that's how it is I mean but
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:41.440]  they have very very different ideas about how the economy should be run
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:48.240]  obviously the singer the vulture and and his hedge fund boys think it should be
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:54.200]  run for them and Obama's billionaires Pritzker and guys like Robert Rubin
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.760]  think it should be run for them there's a there's a conflict because one is
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:07.720]  older more established money and the other's new hot money well where do you
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:11.880]  see it all going because my gut tells me and then I can intellectually
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.200]  geopolitically look at things and tell me stuff's about to get really rocky if
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:19.120]  we think the last four or five years have been crazy what's what's coming up in
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.680]  the future you concur the stuff's about to get really wild yeah I think so I
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.160]  mean one of the things actually I just spoke to a billionaire who is said you
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:33.000]  know we were coming to a second collapse because we haven't felt the full
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.040]  force of the a commercial real estate market collapse and that's heading our
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:44.960]  way again and so you know it the question is can they kite it past the
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:49.640]  election and is there an advantage in someone pulling the trigger before or
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:55.480]  pulling the trigger after the election so we have another round of you know
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:01.880]  another fecal flow coming our way plus you do have the euro which is if you
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:05.640]  read in my lacebook Vulture's Picnic the euro was created with the intent of
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:10.440]  destroying the European economies and we know them it really was I spoke to the
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:15.320]  guy who invented the euro Bob Lindell got the Nobel Prize for it I had long
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:19.280]  conversations with him he's thrilled about it the destruction was part of it
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.080]  that you know what they thought I was creative destruction but the question is
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:28.240]  the destruction doesn't just stay over there you can wreck Europe and what
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.920]  happens over here well I remember you breaking all this down in 2002 and then
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:37.880]  they all day criticize people that are on welfare of them the mega banks hold
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.600]  us hostage but too big to fail that's all part of their plan will they be
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:45.560]  successful we'll talk about that a lot more straight ahead with Greg Palace and
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:50.200]  I'm gonna open the phones up as well we're on the March the Empire's on the

[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:22.080]  selling author the toll free number to join us on this live Tuesday 13th of
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:32.800]  March is 800 25 at 992 31 800 25 at 992 31 Greg I wanted to ask you a question
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:37.600]  because you know I've tracked this county 2012 thing that's got connections to the
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:43.400]  State Department and to the UN and Bill Gates and the rest of them and it you
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.520]  know it's got hundreds of millions of views online raised huge amounts of
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:50.560]  money and it says let's invade Uganda to go after Coney I'm not saying Coney's a
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.000]  good guy but nobody's seen him in five six years and Ugandans are all making
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.960]  videos saying this guy in the issue here our own government's killing us as you
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:02.120]  know you've been to Africa in that area many times and then I made the point when
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:06.120]  Angelina Jolie called for Coney's arrest and invasion you know I'm sick of her
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.640]  she's an official UN envoy not just a spokeswoman and when you know when she's
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:14.480]  not doing Kabbalah rituals or talking about how much she loves death cults
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.680]  she's doing photo ops with children giving him food and stuff when I see the
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:22.720]  UN engaged in crimes against people everywhere she's calling for the Libya
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.720]  Warb went over there in Tunisia to cheer for it and praise the Al Qaeda forces
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:32.440]  she's praising proxy wars in Syria and I know you've dealt with the sob we're
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.320]  not saying he's a good guy she's praising wars all over the place she's
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.720]  clearly it's this left cover for war it's one thing when Bush launches wars it's
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:46.440]  disgusting war crime guaranteed but now with Obama he's launching wars without
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.520]  congressional approval he's getting the peace prize I mean it's it's clear this
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:55.360]  is part of a left-cover operation where I see all these trendies and hippies
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:59.920]  running around calling for all these global proxy wars which aren't about
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:04.880]  in from my research helping people it's all about taking over now I know you've
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:08.200]  been to Africa over and over you're one of the main people who's really
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:13.400]  investigated this and and you know the score probably anybody that I know but
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:18.960]  but 95% or more of the comments were positive the likes were like 98% but
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.720]  it got a lot of attention you know millions of views total scores of
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:27.200]  newspapers picked up my arrest Angelina Jolie for war crimes and what I said in
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.040]  the video is hey Angelina if you're saying arrest Coney and legitimize the
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:36.160]  ICC then by the that yardstick what happened in NATO is a war crime and I've
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:39.680]  had Colonel Schaefer and many others on who worked at those highest levels of
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.920]  deciding what's a war crime and not I've had congressional experts on I mean
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:48.320]  clearly it was an illegal war against Libya the Syria thing with proxies is
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:53.680]  is classically destabilization and an offensive war all of this is going on
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:59.000]  and it's this new left cover what's your view on that well Coney's an
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:05.840]  interesting this Coney to 2012 businesses very interesting because you know
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.600]  obviously Coney is a warlord I've investigated many of these guys he's
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:15.920]  one of dozens by the way and obviously he's a killer he goes in the villages
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.920]  and grabs kids and says if you don't kill your parents and join our army will
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:23.760]  kill you or will kill your parents and then they do anyway yeah he was the he's
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:29.480]  a madman a killer a maniac and and you know you want to hang him up high I have
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.800]  no problem with that the question is what is this telling us what is what is
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:39.080]  Coney 2012 telling us it's telling us first yes send in troops and we don't
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.800]  even know people in America don't even know where the hell that is that we're
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:48.080]  sending them okay and by the way Obama well before this video it's 10 to 100
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:52.040]  commandos are ready and that's what we know of and how many mercenaries we
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:56.880]  don't know obviously you we've had some real problems in that area which go way
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.600]  beyond Mr. Coney and a lot of killing which he's not involved in again no
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.000]  sympathy for that guy but let's look at the distraction you know when the
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.280]  magician is letting the you know letting the the the cute girl in the
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:14.680]  miniskirt to the the tights run around in this case Angelina Jolie what is being
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.240]  covered what aren't you supposed to be looking at behind the curtain and that's
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:26.960]  the question I have there are an awful lot of warlords in in Africa who've
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.880]  been backed by backed by people like Jimmy Carter who supported the maniac
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:38.600]  Charles Taylor who is right now in prison in the Hague for war crimes he was a
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:44.240]  creation of Jimmy Carter and we also had and and who is making money off these
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.480]  things who's making money off the mayhem in the Congo who made money off the mayhem
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:53.680]  in Liberia again let's go back to those elites who you're talking about when I
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.600]  was in I was just in the Congo and I was just in Liberia and I can tell you
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:03.600]  that there are people making money off this mayhem you don't just pull AK-47s
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:08.000]  and and mortars out of trees these are really remote areas someone is sending
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.320]  that in who's doing this well who's benefiting and again we go back to Paul
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:17.640]  people like Paul the vulture singer who holds the debt who when there's civil
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.400]  war and there's madness these guys grab the resources for next to nothing Paul
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.520]  singer has been grabbing the oil resources and cobalt and his vulture
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:32.400]  friends these hedge fund manager managers behind Romney have been grabbing
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:36.640]  the resources of the Congo in the middle of all this mayhem they're grabbing the
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.800]  resources of Uganda in the middle of this mayhem and they have you know they're
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:45.520]  trying to seize Liberia in the middle of this mayhem they're making money off of
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:50.840]  people are making billions off this mayhem and that's why this is happening
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:55.360]  you know if I you know if Angelina Jolie wants to you know put on her pearls
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.840]  and run off into the jungle and grab Coney God bless her but you know the
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:05.280]  other thing is I would much rather see these people grab people like singer the
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:10.960]  vulture in New York and avail Colorado where he has a nice ski place I'd like
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.280]  to see them you know all these guys behind restore our future the Romney
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:20.640]  super pack well that's my point let me just throw this caveat in here look this
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.920]  guy hadn't been seen in years he's a minor little nobody warlord up in the
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:27.760]  northern area in Uganda probably isn't even there and it all comes out at a
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.760]  time when they want to escalate activities there the installed leader of
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.880]  26 years of Uganda's connected to all this destabilization and mass death that's
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.720]  happened and it's just all part of like celebrating UN intervention and the
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:47.800]  Hague when the UN itself has got one of the nastiest histories I've ever seen
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:52.800]  but they have diplomatic immunity which they pull out of the sky so that's my
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.720]  point is that when you see the entire establishment media pushing something you
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:00.240]  know it stinks to high heaven and I mean what's your view on the Libya war I
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.120]  mean that clearly was illegal he didn't get authorization from Congress for that
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:09.600]  I I really have no opinions on the Libya war except to say that I was you know
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.920]  from vultures picnic of the book as investigating British petroleum you have
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:18.000]  to look at at whose interests are being served first first the the the same guys
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.840]  that sent in planes to bomb and kill Gaddafi were the guys that were hugging
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.360]  him Tony Blair on the day that the United States and Great Britain recognized
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:33.920]  the killer terrorist government of Gaddafi the very same day British
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:40.800]  petroleum signed a $2 billion agreement with Gaddafi okay to develop oil in the
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:48.080]  Benghazi eastern sector of Libya when the rebel army broke out when the
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:53.440]  rebellion broke out and Gaddafi he was he was kept inside triply that meant
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:57.240]  that the oil fields which are in the east are under the control the rebels as
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:01.800]  soon as they got control the oil fields suddenly there are friends suddenly they
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.520]  have to be protected when Gaddafi was just slaughtering people slaughtering
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.400]  people we didn't do anything about taking him out I mean that could have you
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.720]  know jeopardize the contracts but the minute that Gaddafi lost control the
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:17.240]  oil fields of the east he was gone see he made a mistake he was concerned about
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:20.600]  military control he should have been keeping his hand on the spigot he'd be
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:26.480]  alive today that's how it works and that's a sad thing again no one no one
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:30.640]  wants to say Gaddafi we should defend Gaddafi or let him stay there any of
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.960]  those things but it is it's not unfortunately it's not about saving
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.000]  lives because we could have saved lives by going he's not being removed to bring
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.960]  peace they brought al-qaeda in they're wrecking the country they're putting in
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.040]  hardcore hard line islamic regimes I'm told all day give my rights up because
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.120]  the extremist Muslims are gonna get me meanwhile you know our governments are
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.000]  constantly you know giving them the keys to the city what do you make of the
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.040]  latest developments in Iran three aircraft carriers stacking up right off
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:05.160]  the coast there's a big Washington Post full-page ad mr. president say no to war
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:09.960]  of choice with Iran and it's got Admiral Mullen in there and it's got the former
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.880]  head of scent comment there and it's got major general Paul Eaton you know
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:17.800]  there's a whole bunch of them signed on there saying saying it's bad it's bad
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:20.880]  for Israel you got the former head of massage saying don't do it it'd be
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:26.040]  suicide what's your view on Iran and what's the inside sources you've got on
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:32.640]  where we are with a new war you know and unfortunately I don't have enough good
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:38.280]  sources in Iran and you know a Seymour Hirsch was always saying that we are
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:41.120]  bombing we're gonna bomb we're gonna bomb he's been saying it for years from
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:44.840]  the inside the question is they've been bombing actually though and a proxy war
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:49.680]  and so the question is who likes to keep the pot stirring and I think that you
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.680]  have you have three guys running for reelection Ahmadinejad in in Iran
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:43:00.320]  Obama in the United States Netanyahu in Israel and these guys need the pot
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:05.520]  boiling they're all coming to get us war war war and suddenly you know that as
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:10.960]  you well know war increases popularity for reelection it's you know it's the
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:14.480]  oldest trick in the book they're coming to get us and we have to rally around the
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.120]  flag and rally around our president war is the health of the state right and so
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:25.880]  and and plus keep in mind every time Ahmadinejad says booga booga booga we've
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:31.440]  got centrifuges the price of oil kicks back up and you know I sometimes wonder
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.880]  if Ahmadinejad and Obama and trade phone calls it's your turn this week to
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:40.200]  make the threat you know I you have to look at the oil market which is what I
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:43.400]  do I look at economics I look at the oil market you know you see these guys
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.400]  jerking it up and down they're having on someone's having a lot of fun with the
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:51.920]  oil market there I can tell you that you know whether sometimes these things the
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:58.320]  games the fun and games get out of hand they actually start bombing that I can't
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:03.840]  prognosticate and it's way beyond my crystal balls ability but I do know
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:10.320]  that the endless boiling pot is a political bonanza for these guys and is
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:14.840]  a bonanza for the energy companies and the oil companies they're they're
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:20.640]  grinning keep the war going shut down those fields make them burn limit the
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.120]  supply choke it off keep oil above a hundred bucks a barrel all right on your
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:31.800]  radar screen in the election Ron Paul is finally coming out in Maine other areas
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:35.920]  pointing out there was election fraud against him we know that goes on but
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:40.960]  I mean with Mitt Romney or Obama I mean they're both the same pedigree a lot of
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:46.640]  the same backers same policies both of them are basically kindles that read off
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:52.360]  teleprompters I mean who would somebody vote for with that choice of two evils
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:57.160]  I mean I don't I don't see a lesser of two evils there but I mean Obama I got
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:01.360]  to say who I thought he was a total puppet he really is given Bush a run
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:06.760]  for his money with the NDAA and just these federal rulings on free speech
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:12.440]  and everything I mean this is Twilight Zone yeah I mean for those who who went
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.040]  for the hope and change you know and got and swallowed the whole line from the
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:22.080]  Pope of Hope hey go visit Guantanamo you know that that he was gonna close
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.640]  remember that so you know it's it's look the one nice thing about being
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:30.760]  investigative journalists work at BBC I'm not even allowed to make a choice on
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:35.840]  the election so I don't so I'm relieved of that tremendous burden and
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:39.960]  difficulty I do know that there's going to be a lot of vote manipulation that
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:45.720]  there's a lot in it and it's not so much taking stealing votes left Democrat or
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:50.080]  Republican I've done a lot of vote theft investigation and it's about
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:56.320]  disempowering groups it if you look at the demographics it's not so much black
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:02.480]  white but working class versus elite voters elite voters are pretty much
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:07.040]  left alone even if they're Democrats or Republicans and what we're seeing is
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.680]  things like the tricks I was just in fact writing about a minute ago tricks like
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:15.960]  caging where they send out letters to you at your register address if you're
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.480]  not there they challenge your vote registrations fraudulent well they were
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:26.000]  sending Carl Rose office was sending letters out to soldiers at their home
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.680]  addresses now they're allowed to vote from Iraq or Afghanistan but if the
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.880]  letter came back addressing out there they lost their right to vote and they
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:38.200]  send in their ballots from overseas and the vote vote sunk accounting because
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:42.440]  they've been challenged at being out of they're not at their home address you
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:45.880]  know it's a this is the type of games that are being played we're going to see
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:52.600]  an awful lot of that stuff this year and again it's it's going to be about a
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:59.920]  kind of classed war by proxy taking away your power to vote well I agree with
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:03.520]  you I want to go to some phone calls here but I wanted to bring up a separate
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:08.600]  issue with you are you noticing that either people are more awake now or
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.680]  they're getting more into a trance I mean a literal trance I'm seeing people
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:17.720]  and I've got a statistic here it's five times more dangerous to text while
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:24.680]  driving than to drink while driving but no one seems to care I saw all sorts of
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:29.000]  crazy driving an erect today with people watching videos or texting all those
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.640]  they had they had smart phones up their faces while driving 70 miles an hour and
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:38.960]  I think that that's a symptom of a public that's just totally become passive
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:42.920]  like spectators and now they think driving a car spectator they think I
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:47.280]  mean I'm really worried about humanity itself Craig that's kind of a wild card
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.560]  curveball no no no no I this is actually something I've been thinking quite a bit
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:58.120]  about because I'm in media you know to me always the most dangerous drug addiction
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:02.880]  in America had been television and you know it takes over your head you have
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:09.320]  a suspension of belief it takes over your senses now it's 24 7 people wake up
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:14.560]  with with those iPhone with the ear pods in their ears they're getting the
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:17.640]  messages straight into their brain I'm not talking about like some type of
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:22.080]  doctor Moriarty in some cave with some dials putting some weird waves and
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:27.240]  signals in your head I'm talking about just the damn info junk the news goo is
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.400]  my media critic friend Danny Schecter calls it that they're filling your head
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:37.880]  with junk with garbage and you know from you know so that you know around and
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:41.320]  that's why you get this repetitive thing just like just like television
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:46.680]  commercials will be repeated over and over again with this with ear pods in
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:51.360]  our ears cable constantly at us you've got the you know the the information
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:57.360]  coming off the screen all the time and so you hear Iran Iran Iran you know you
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:01.040]  hear you hear these chants and these mantras they stop making any sense you
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:09.520]  just know that Iran danger you know terrorists fear it's it's a more like
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:15.280]  endless commercials than it is information and it's being fed non-stop so
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:19.600]  it's subconscious you're doing something else you're driving or whatever we I
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:26.080]  we've got like a hypnotized nation it's like prozac a stand here prozac a stand
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:32.520]  did you coin that yeah yeah but that's what it kind of is I mean it's like I'm
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:36.920]  well I do look around it scares me and and you know I mean maybe I especially I
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.520]  must admit I have a 14 year old the 15 year old daughter who's you know and and
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:46.520]  I'm wondering is she what's going on here it's like zombies and they're not
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.040]  actually into what they're listening to which is the interesting thing they're
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:54.960]  not really listening on the phone or listening to whatever broadcast or music
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.040]  is going on they're only half listening but they're only half paying attention
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:02.720]  there's a kind of twilight zone effect that's going on and I'm worried that in
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:07.640]  that twilight zone effect it's almost a hypnotic trance you're subject to this

[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:22.360]  how do we keep people from slipping into that state how do we do that because the
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:26.280]  world is getting crazier and crazier and the establishment knows they're
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:31.880]  dumbing down the media they know they're they're distracting the public what
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:37.360]  type of world is being built it's hellish let's go to some phone calls in
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:42.320]  this segment the next for our guest Bergen in Wisconsin you're on the air with
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.960]  Greg Pallas go ahead hi it's Bregen and it's an honor to speak with you again
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.680]  Greg I've seen you speak at the Fighting Bob LaFollette Festival in
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:57.360]  Madison and at the Barrymore Theater and I shamelessly plugged info wars on the
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:05.360]  community access radio WRT when you were on and I was just wanted to speak to or
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:10.480]  have you speak to a cross-paradigm appeal if you could because as you well
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:15.920]  know Madison Wisconsin it's highly the population is highly intelligent and
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:24.640]  highly educated but the there is that underlying Alex calls them pencil necks
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:31.560]  or whatever but there is a kind of a snarky smarmy chicken necks chicken necks
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:36.960]  academic class with filled with semi-informed via disinformation or
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:42.600]  misinformation population that has the potential has the potential to really
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:47.500]  come together with yeah but they buy into a paradigm that because they they
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:51.520]  take a certain orthodoxy that they're really smart and you're not and they're
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.760]  following clown level narratives just like mainline Republicans are how do
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:02.240]  you break through that Greg Pallas information that's what we're trying to
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:08.840]  do here in other words look when you have something like Coney 2012 you're
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:15.040]  speaking directly to people's simplest heart-felt emotions and that's good in
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.280]  some ways but then it leads you to dumb in other ways in other words they are
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:24.720]  really distracting you and so you know I think you want to do with the with the
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:31.440]  sophisticates is to remind them that you know if they are that they are
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.400]  susceptible to being duped to and remind them if they are really smart they'll
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:39.360]  ask some questions like you know like one thing I did at the when I was in
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:45.560]  with Madison, Wisconsin as I challenged the the the great god of of the chicken
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:50.240]  necks as you would call them Alex national petroleum radio and the
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:55.920]  petroleum broadcast system which were absolutely running the oil industry's
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:02.280]  virtual infomercials after the deep water rise and explosion on their so-called
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.840]  investigative programs frontline for example and I have a section in vultures
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:14.600]  picnic about this in in PBS ran a program saying oh it's all BP's cultural
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.800]  problems they don't have a culture safety like they didn't wear you know
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:22.080]  white gloves at the opera but it wouldn't this wouldn't happen with a
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:27.240]  wonderful company like Chevron which wouldn't do these things and they'd
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:31.760]  never mentioned that Chevron is the official number one national corporate
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:37.600]  sponsor of PBS they basically said you know trust Chevron not those BP guys and
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:42.200]  then I went to the jungles of Ecuador and found that you know Chevron is
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:47.200]  poisoning thousands of people it's really ugly there's mass cancers from the
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:51.680]  junk that they're dropping and by the way there's more Chevron destruction more
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:55.680]  destruction of the wetlands by Chevron oil in the Gulf than from the BP deep
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:59.720]  water horizon but you know the patrolling broadcast system isn't going to do
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:04.160]  that so they have a certain there's a certain elite agreement there's a certain
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:08.520]  agreement that you'll get from the views of the Washington Post and the New York
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:14.200]  Times and PBS and they have one viewpoint and it's simply accepted that
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:20.360]  that is the given truth and everyone else is just a schmuck and a bozo and a
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:26.000]  redneck and you know and a conspiracy nut but more and more they're losing
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.680]  credibility so the system's openly trying to censor the free exchange of
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:34.640]  ideas because we're cleaning their clocks back in 60 seconds with more of
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:44.120]  Greg Pallas than James Rappaport you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com

[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:20.800]  Alex Jones. We'll continue with your calls when James Rappaport investigative
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:23.480]  journalist joins us and I'll run through a bunch of headlines I haven't gotten to
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:31.520]  yet. Greg Palast author of Vultures Picnic is our guest GregPalast.com
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:35.520]  Let's jam in a few more phone calls. Brian in North Carolina you're on the
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:43.640]  ear go ahead. Hey Alex Jones and Greg Palast. I was wondering what do you think
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:50.000]  about the Gen 21 plan that you and take over of the United States? Okay I'll get
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.840]  Greg's take on that. You have these multinational corporations again through
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:58.160]  left cover getting global zoning passed so they can basically take property
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:02.440]  imminent domain stuff like that Greg. Well I don't know how much it has to do
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:07.360]  with the UN but I can tell you the WTO documents that I have which they're
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:11.760]  confidential documents and by the way I presented them to the to the director
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:18.920]  general of the WTO Pascal Lamy. One thing I didn't perk of working at BBC I
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:23.120]  could actually get to these to these critters to these top guys and yeah
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:29.040]  they've got a great program for imposing an international set of laws
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:37.200]  that overwhelm any laws for protection of health safety and property and any
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:43.960]  passed by any parliament or Congress so that the these new WTO and financial
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:49.720]  services agreement that's at the the new elements of the gas treaty general
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:55.040]  agreement on trade and services these now are trumping
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:00.400]  parliamentary and congressional votes so there is a it's a it's a replacement for
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:04.840]  democracy and that's what I'm very very concerned about but it the main
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:10.120]  mechanism seems to be through the WTO and of course and the IMF and World Bank
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:15.600]  which coordinates with it does that answer your question I guess it does the
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:18.920]  colors gone let's go to Steve in Florida quick question from Steve Steve
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:24.520]  welcome yeah good afternoon hey Alex I thought about when you're talking about
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:30.600]  Angelina Jolie and her being an employee of the UN the Coney 2012 and then what we
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:36.920]  see Obama doing with the NDAA and you know last week with the Senate Armed
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:41.280]  Services Committee and basically them declaring war on the American people in
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:45.800]  essence and I was thinking there's an event that occurred early on in Obama's
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:51.000]  presidency and I think ties this whole thing all together and really sent a
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.360]  message that a lot of people overlooked and I think it's mainly because it
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:58.280]  really wasn't covered in the you know the so-called media you were pretty much
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:01.520]  the only one covering this and I think you need to highlight this and bring it
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:08.000]  out tell us and that's about when he simultaneously was president and chaired
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.160]  the UN security council yeah violates article one section nine I have a great
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:19.200]  points Greg and closing I'm sure you've seen this Obama told Congress last year
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:22.280]  and now this year last week they have the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:27.120]  SEC DEF tell them no Congress isn't over war now the UN and NATO give us our
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:32.600]  orders very bizarre it's one thing of a president power grabs but what do you
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:39.520]  make of that well you know to me it's all about I just follow the money you
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:44.960]  know who's making money from all this stuff you have a tremendous growing and
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:48.680]  still growing arms industry and and by the way within like for example the
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:53.640]  emergency war bills we had eight billion dollars which will go to fifty six
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:57.080]  billion dollars in nuclear plant guarantees in the war bills so under
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:02.360]  the cover of fighting terror of war of like you say international you know
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:06.880]  endless international war war without end and the big mega banks are global
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:10.720]  they want war so they're gonna tell Congress fly kite and no matter you
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:16.080]  know in other words someone's making money off this increasing global
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:22.920]  militarization of of our foreign policy and our financial system it's a very
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:27.120]  troubling thing you know I died I'm you know how it's the mechanism is being done
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:31.800]  that's my investigative work is to go into the details of the grander you know
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:36.320]  I'll give you the dots and Alex you you connect them all right Greg palace
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:41.080]  calm thank you for joining us Greg great Alex as always all right we're gonna

[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:55.800]  bunch of news as well it is really stacking up we're not in Kansas anymore
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:03.480]  when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:08.080]  if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:17.320]  there's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans they
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:26.400]  so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit they put a diamond

[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:08.360]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:11.800]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:16.580]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:54.160]  America and she said a lady with a Polish accent screamed at her off and on
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:56.880]  for hours kind of like when I flew up to Canada one time to cover Bilderberg
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:01.720]  and said you're being sent back and we're revoking the visa waiver program
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:06.200]  you know because everybody from the EU can just fly over here Germany France you

[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:26.960]  supposed to fly her to Houston but they rerouted the plane to Illinois to
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:32.400]  Chicago and of course they've canceled that g20 meeting and moved it to camp
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:39.840]  David there outside DC but just real I mean that shows you the whole spigot but
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.720]  the borders are wide open any legal aliens can do whatever they want I mean
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:48.760]  they have big Mexican consulates in Houston Dallas Austin San Antonio where
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:52.560]  you just go in anybody can go in and get a fake ID that is accepted by the
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:57.240]  police insurance companies banks people like but it's the Mexican consulate yeah
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:01.360]  but it's a fake ID they'll give it to anybody was it six seven years ago I
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:05.520]  had the speaker of the Colorado Senate on at the time he went in one day and
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:12.360]  got four at one Mexican consulate at one day an Anglo guy can't even speak
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:17.680]  Spanish went in four times in a circle and when they got four different ones
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:23.320]  you can set up a bank account anything with but you want to fly here from South
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:28.480]  Africa or Germany or Australia you are treated like abject trash you know I've
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:31.440]  seen the videos on YouTube of people having these problems I've talked to
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:36.520]  folks that I personally know this has happened to where well one guy's got a
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:41.720]  French wife he said two children with her and she still has to go back to
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:45.160]  France a few times a year and the government's always threatening to
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:49.000]  kick her out of the country I mean it is this country is such a joke folks
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:54.240]  everything is about targeting the law abiding everything is about running us
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:57.640]  into the ground while the criminal government does whatever it wants I
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:00.880]  mean I've had police on this show they've been in the news where illegal
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:06.240]  aliens are arrested for DWI the judges just let them go and again item that I
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:09.880]  disliking Latin American illegals the point is wide why are they above the
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:14.640]  law because it's part of the merger of North America in the SPP documents that
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:19.480]  judicial watch student got a long time ago it's all there all right I have got
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:24.720]  an insane amount of news and loaded phones here and there's so much crazy
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:33.920]  news coming out I mean that they're now admitting that Google is run by DARPA in
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:40.400]  the Department of Defense that's in CNET news which is CBS Google hires DARPA
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:45.400]  director Regina Duggan I mean it was publicly shut up by DARPA so you think
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:48.920]  you're getting info they're getting info on you and they get you to opt in
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.840]  that's their trick once when Silicon Valley a few months ago killed the
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:56.520]  supper bill it's because they weren't gonna let the hamfisted recording
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:01.440]  industry come in and do it they said no no no that's not how we do it we just
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:07.200]  disappear people off the web we're gonna have web IDs web taxes all of that so
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:12.240]  big news Department of Justice wants court to keep Google in SA partnership
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:17.160]  secret court hearings scheduled for next week and ongoing effort by
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:20.920]  privacy group to expose the tales of working relationships Steve Watson
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:24.600]  another article that I've got here in my stack that I'll try to get to tomorrow
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:29.040]  because we've got our guests holding and I want to hear from him James Rappaport of
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:36.360]  no more fake news calm great mind when it comes to this information John Rappaport
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:45.360]  excuse me what'd I call him James Rappaport James John I'm Jack Rappaport
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:51.200]  will call me Easter Bunny anyway side issue John Rappaport
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:55.080]  problems I got so much in my mind so much I want to cover here that I end up
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:13:02.880]  just stumbling over at all last year pro-life groups came out and said that a
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:10.560]  flavoring division of PepsiCo was using a bordered fetal tissue for the
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:15.000]  flavoring in Pepsi products and I went and researched it and there was evidence
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.800]  it was true now Pepsi has gone in in federal court and I have the article
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:22.880]  here in my stack and I went and read the ruling last night this came out like a
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:29.520]  week ago I just learned of it last night because people in the message board at
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:33.880]  info wars on the stories will say hey check this out and I sat there and read
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:39.480]  the ruling and they said yeah we are using fetal tissue but we don't want
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:44.840]  our shareholders to have access to what we're putting in the drinks and they got
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:50.120]  you know pro-life but also just sane people on their board not on their board
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:55.720]  but as stockholders and so the Obama administration ruled in an amicus brief to
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:01.600]  the federal court that this is just business practices standard business
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:07.800]  and flavorings are a secret now coke is cocaine it's D it's decokinated cocaine
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:11.920]  people like really yeah it's what's called coke go look it up it's the fact
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:23.200]  and PepsiCo goes along those lines and and uses the denatured cocaine flavor
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:27.840]  but I thought I would start here today where I began last week when John
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:33.760]  Rappaport was on the nightly news show bringing this up because he'd been
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:37.480]  writing about something that's now been picked up by the mainstream that all
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:41.640]  these bioethicist journals that are the prestigious groups that sit over the
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:45.600]  the hospital boards are saying yeah we're gonna kill even healthy babies
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:51.520]  forget the debate about killing babies that have problems and pretty soon oh
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:55.240]  you're blind oh you're you have hearing problems you're dead oh you're
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:58.600]  genetic show you're aggressive we say that's a handicap you're dead they say
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.320]  kill babies up to three that are healthy and and there's a new article out
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:06.680]  bioethicist professor drug the population to accepting green world order with
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:10.120]  chemicals in the food and water that's already going on see we're in this
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:15.040]  nightmare scenario so I wanted to raise that with him that even when I can't
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:21.160]  believe something's real that they're using baby fetuses for flavoring I know
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:26.880]  they were using them for women's cosmetics I knew that it was in a lot of
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:32.200]  the vaccines but I mean it's in the Pepsi John Rappaport of no more fake news
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:39.920]  calm I mean the dehumanization is just incredible John hey Alex it goes across
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:44.280]  the board I mean you can start with genetically modified food you can start
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:49.160]  anywhere in the food chain but this piece in the journal medical ethics was
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:53.920]  basically a recommendation that said anything that can be aborted before
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:16:00.840]  birth can be killed after birth for the same reasons or no reasons without it
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:07.400]  being a crime or even something you have to blink at because this is not a real
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:14.480]  person yet this was the hypothesis offered by some a couple of insane
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:21.080]  ethicists mind you because you see a person is only a person when they can
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:26.440]  envision goals and they want to go after them and achieve them but up until that
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:32.800]  age whenever that occurs they're really not a person so the parents the state
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:37.440]  anybody could just decide to kill them and it would be okay it wouldn't be a
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:41.760]  crime and so this was reported with a straight face I mean I read some of the
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:45.720]  comments sections people saying no this couldn't be real I mean this is some
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:53.160]  kind of a joke it's not even April 1st yet but no this is the academic world you
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:57.680]  know cooperating with intelligence agencies governments and so forth with
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:03.120]  the program of trying to convince people okay we can do anything we want to to
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:09.360]  you and we don't have to call it a crime it doesn't matter you're under our
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:15.800]  umbrella and we control the situation and people don't respond to this they
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:20.160]  just read it and they pass on to something else but this is happening this
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:24.840]  is like saying you know we've got a guy over in Princeton University Lee Silver
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:30.120]  who said for a long time now well what we really need to do is you know and
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:34.520]  this is going to happen we're going to generically engineer engineer the human
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:40.440]  race and people who can afford to buy the good genes you know they'll buy them
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:45.240]  in the free market and those that can't will be completely separate and living
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:51.080]  separate from the enhanced part of the population well this is mainstream
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:55.920]  academia we're not talking about people hiding in bunkers somewhere you know
[02:17:55.920 --> 02:18:02.480]  cooking up bizarre scenarios this is not island of dr. maru this is what they
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:06.560]  really are doing and I think you hit the nail completely on the head when you
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:10.280]  pointed out this was reported like they were talking about the you know the
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:14.680]  price of squash or something at the local grocery store and people were in
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:18.360]  the London Telegraph article the Info Wars article and others saying this
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:22.320]  can't be real this is a joke because the globalists are moving the overton
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:25.760]  window they're getting everybody ready now where they go yeah there's world
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:29.440]  government yeah we're putting stuff in your water yeah we're gonna kill
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:33.720]  babies Bill Gates is like yeah we're gonna kill grandma I mean it's just it's
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:38.320]  like why do you think they're coming out in the open right now because they
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:45.320]  think that people are so depleted brainwashed weak hypnotized that there
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:51.160]  won't be any reaction to it I mean this is all an intelligence agency type
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:57.560]  operation propaganda operation that's been going on in the press for decades
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:02.960]  now you tell one story wilder than another it doesn't matter what it is you
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:08.560]  know man born with six heads three donkeys seen falling out of the sky in
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:13.800]  Russia and after a while people become so inured to all of this they just don't
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:18.200]  respond and so then you come out with a story saying well two ethicists
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:22.640]  recommend killing babies and it's not a crime and everybody nods to their heads
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:28.800]  because they've been conditioned to accept this incredibly bizarre world of
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:34.040]  information that we live in and so the powers that be have now assumed okay
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:39.040]  population is sunk they have no power left they don't know what they're doing
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:43.040]  they're in a trance we can come out in the open and say whatever we want exactly
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:46.080]  I don't know if you heard my first hour but I was driving to work today with
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:51.440]  people with with their smartphones up with their faces wrecking and crashing
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:57.520]  and smashing it was like a zombie moving we'll be right back a little over a year
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:02.000]  ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.920]  meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:10.000]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and

[02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:11.880]  Rappaport is our guest John we know what this program is and I've studied the
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:17.920]  globalist I know you have in your decades as an investigative journalist I
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:22.560]  they've got a weird system of rules where they have to tell you what they're
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:27.000]  gonna do to you before they do it and so what I see them doing is dehumanizing
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.720]  us but giving us the choice making us where we don't care about each other
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:34.960]  and a watch a woman bleed to death hit by a car you know whatever the case is we
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:38.720]  know that's it epic proportions right now people being totally self-centered
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:43.240]  and then as the globalists come in and start accelerating their soft kill we
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:47.960]  can't stand up for each other because we've had our very survival instinct
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:53.800]  taken from us and and and people now revel in being ignorant it's seen as a
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:25:00.480]  badge of honor to be an idiot to be soft to be metrosexual what what is the
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:05.280]  global controllers in game from your decades of research working in ABC CBS
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:08.840]  newsrooms you know investigative journals for big magazines for folks and
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:13.640]  I'm introducing you to me I know you are bottom line everything seems to be
[02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:21.400]  accelerating right now what is the end game some the end game some to me is a
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:28.400]  universe of the planet as a universal hospital and everybody's a patient under
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:37.200]  lifelong care dependent dependent dependent on the controllers people
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:43.400]  strutting around wearing the badges that signify proudly what their diseases
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:49.720]  and disorders are their ignorance is just as this you know you were talking
[02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:56.760]  about a minute ago there breeding a whole new kind of world citizen you see
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:02.480]  I'm dependent yes of course and I'm proud to be dependent on the forces above
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:07.280]  and I've got the diseases and the disorders and the disabilities and the
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:13.360]  ignorance to prove it that I am completely dependent and this is how I
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:18.880]  proudly state myself and of course then you install the control mechanisms and
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:23.440]  the bureaucracies and the regional governments and the global de facto
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:28.880]  management system to bring it all into being this is one reason why I focus so
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:33.680]  heavily on the medical cartel over the last 15 years because this is in the
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:38.960]  long run the real thrust of this whole thing is to debilitate people so thoroughly
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:43.680]  with chemicals and drugs and vaccines and so forth my friend Robert Scott Bell
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:48.680]  and I just did a 10-hour audio seminar out of you know defense called vaccines
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:53.320]  armed and dangerous because we want to get this information out to people who
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:58.600]  are not yet quite brainwashed that you know this is where everything is being
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:05.640]  funneled into this idea of dependence disease disorder you don't know what
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:11.280]  you're doing you're a victim you can't stand up for yourself pure crystallized
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:16.560]  veritas I tried to say everything you just said in an hour in the first hour
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:21.440]  that you just said in two minutes pure truth from my gut my intellectual
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:25.600]  understanding my deep research the globalist as you know admit they're
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:28.960]  gonna GMO everything and screw up the environment so they control it they're
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:33.760]  playing God they want to make everybody sick and then give you treatments that
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:38.000]  make you a slave to them screw up the DNA so bad you've got to go to them to
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.080]  have a kid then they decide what's aggressive genes they admit they're
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:47.520]  gonna fix it they're admitting all this it is so diabolical yes completely over
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:51.600]  the top they're just coming right out in the open and they're saying this see
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:58.280]  that you you don't have any choice here it's not about freedom anymore I mean
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:03.920]  where do you even see in the mainstream press anymore the word the phrase
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:08.960]  individual freedom or God forbid individual power I mean that's completely
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:13.640]  xed out of the equation those words are verboten it's all now about the group
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:18.000]  it's about the collective about what what you owe to the community your
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:24.360]  membership in the you know society of being screwed basically of being a
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:27.900]  victim whether you want to be or not whether you're a real victim or a
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:33.520]  phony victim we accept you but in order to gain admission in order to buy that
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:37.920]  ticket in order to get in the door in order to be a member of you know the
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:43.040]  globalist controlled world you have to admit that you're powerless that's what
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:46.360]  you've got to do and that you're diseased and that you're disabled and that
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:50.400]  you're ignorant that you don't know what logic is and you can't think then we
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:55.760]  open the door wide to you and we say aha you belong now and you get all the
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:01.040]  benefits and of course it's cradle-to-grave Alex I mean the medical
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:06.480]  cartel when they vaccinate a baby you know in the first few hours of birth
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:13.440]  bang what they're hoping for is much more than a vaccine it's we've got you in
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:19.880]  the system now you are a cradle-to-grave patient we've begun and we've begun to
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:24.520]  literally like vampires debilitate you and from the diseases we're giving you
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:28.880]  now we're gonna suck you dry through your whole life and they also feed on the
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:34.240]  misery they love it globalists from studying of hate beauty and strength and
[02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:38.960]  individualism they're the pit of hell John Rappaport our guests will be right

[02:32:49.240 --> 02:33:02.080]  www.silverlungs.com from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:06.280]  all right I've literally got hundreds of insane articles here in front of me I
[02:33:06.280 --> 02:33:10.320]  covered some of them in the first and second hour but more and more I realize
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:16.800]  that our fight is about getting people to think for themselves now a lot of
[02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:19.680]  people are waking up but then they just don't trust anything they don't have any
[02:33:19.680 --> 02:33:25.080]  information so then they turn everything into a conspiracy instead of real
[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:29.040]  global government out in the open coming down on us and I agree with John
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:34.040]  Rappaport of no more fake news.com that that it is the medical tyranny that it's
[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:38.200]  at the heart of the eugenics the heart of the takeover your local doctors just
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:44.000]  brainwashed a departmentalized and he was he was getting into vaccines look at
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.640]  look at what they put the water they call it fluoride then they say fluorides
[02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:51.680]  good well it's hundreds of chemicals under the name fluoride then you find
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:56.560]  out it is a program to reduce fertility and cause DNA damage and then now
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:01.040]  they're admitting it see what's crazy is they've gone from denying all this and
[02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:03.320]  I think we were really hurting them back when they would say there's no
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:07.200]  Bilderberg group just six years ago now they say it exists but we're crazy to
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:13.160]  not like it but now they come out and say yeah we are drugging your water what
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:16.880]  you gonna do about it so I think it's an attempt to psychologically like John
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:20.640]  was saying just condition everybody where everything's so wild people kind of
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:25.160]  get overwhelmed in two now but I don't really see that working it's working with
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:29.280]  a large mass of people but unfortunately they've never counted people that want to
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:33.040]  be sheep that want to be run over it's always been a very small group on the
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:37.280]  side of evil and a very small group on the side of liberty who want to see true
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:41.120]  human empowerment that fight over things and I'm telling you I think we've got
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:45.400]  greater numbers than people even had back in 1775 John but I want to get your
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:52.080]  your your expert take on that but at the same time they have this this
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:57.400]  scorched earth policy though of just of madness I mean I mean sure there's a
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:02.080]  method of the madness but still aren't the the the global social controllers
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:08.400]  themselves insane I don't think you could frame any better definition of
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:13.720]  insanity than that I mean that is the epitome of insanity but I agree with
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:19.600]  you there are so many people who are waking up and who understand what the
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:26.240]  stakes are in this game and that how important individual freedom is but to
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:32.040]  me this is a crucial thing here you have to say look it's about freedom it is
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:37.560]  about freedom for example do you have the right to refuse a vaccine or a drug
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:42.040]  do you have the right to take a nutritional supplement and take care of
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:45.800]  manage your own health your own body and so forth do you have that freedom is
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:50.240]  that a right because as soon as people begin to think about that they begin to
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:54.720]  wake up they say well don't I I mean I would assume I have that right now the
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:58.800]  government's trying to bully me now and lying and saying it's the law when it's
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:02.880]  not okay well here's an example with this whole thing with choice this is a
[02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:07.360]  control freak revolution against our common law and basic facts take the TSA
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:13.640]  John as you know they're there to say guilty until proven innocent and only
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:17.800]  the government is exempt I mean isn't that a all-out revolution against
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:23.440]  freedom yeah of course it's the idea well everybody is now a potential
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:28.000]  terrorist you have a baby in a carriage you have a three-year-old your
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:33.720]  grandmother who's 95 and she can't walk everybody is now a potential terrorist
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:37.200]  despite the fact that there are much better methods of doing security at
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:40.720]  airport than than all of this and say and despite the fact most the terrorism
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:50.640]  staged yeah yeah we can't forget that little item see but I predicted that
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:57.200]  these newspapers the media basically who are the organs of you know global
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:03.040]  forces globalist forces we're gonna go under you know 10 15 years ago as soon
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:07.480]  as I got on the internet I said well that's it for them I mean because they
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:12.120]  are just simply propaganda outlets they don't know how to say themselves they're
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:15.440]  just gonna keep parroting the line and people gonna start waking up on the
[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:19.920]  internet and these media organs are going down the tubes which is exactly
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:24.400]  what's been happening I mean the New York Times is refinancing the financing of
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:29.520]  their debt just to say a float and you know I've talked with several mainstream
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:33.840]  reporters and editors and I said to them listen I said let's just take a
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:38.640]  ridiculous scenario which is you make me managing editor of your newspaper and
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:43.200]  in six months I'll save your newspaper your sales will go so far through the
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:46.280]  roof you won't even believe it they said well what are you talking about I said
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:50.800]  because I've got a list of maybe 30 or 40 stories right here at my fingertips
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:54.880]  that if you not only put in your headlines every day but pounded on day
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:59.400]  after day after day after day your sales would be off the charts and they said
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:04.080]  well for example what and I said okay every year in the United States medical
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:12.040]  system kills 225,000 people every year so by decade that's 2.25 million people
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:18.440]  through what happens in hospitals and 106,000 a year deaths caused by FDA
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:23.880]  approved medicines and I've got the study that illustrates that improves at
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:29.000]  July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association Dr. Barbara Starfield
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.840]  who at the time was working for the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health it's
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:37.520]  all there now let's take that story and let's run with it like you ran with
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:41.920]  Watergate every day pounding on it doctors coming out of the woodwork
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:46.680]  finally confessing they knew about this the FDA admitting they knew about this
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:50.120]  and did nothing about it the government never trying to remedy this
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:54.960]  situation 2.25 million people killed every year in the United States in the
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:59.600]  medical system that's medical genocide let's take that one story I could save
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:04.160]  your newspaper with that one story we would be running articles day night
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:08.520]  afternoon you would be selling three editions on the street every day and
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:13.360]  they just ran away into the woodwork screaming into the night because they
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:17.520]  realized they couldn't do it they couldn't do it because they're sold
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:21.800]  they're bought and sold they're the complete ownership of the medical
[02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:26.360]  cartel in that case so where do you see all this in the future going I keep
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:30.680]  saying what what's the end game we know they're in game a giant system where
[02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:35.560]  they give us one poison and then make us sell out for the cure or the treatment
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:39.720]  you know to that poison never you know telling us they're the one engaged in
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:44.040]  the poisoning even though they've been caught versus their plans for humanity
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:48.480]  how do you see this battle this interchange taking place because we've
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:53.360]  got a leg up on them because we're an ancient species humans want to be free
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:58.080]  we're very adaptive you know despite all their attacks that's when humans
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:01.440]  really start to shine they've been trying to kill us with this plastic
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:06.280]  poisonous fake prosperity people are really you know starting to wake up to
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:11.880]  that but there's also in history in every major culture when things start
[02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:19.640]  going really nuts people tend to defend the status quo even more and so like I
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:23.480]  said the system is openly trying to act really wild and nuts right now like you
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:28.080]  said to just create a learned helplessness or a overload how do you see
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:34.200]  all that mixing together decentralization of power is the key
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:41.360]  always was always will be people begin to opt out of the system in every way
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:46.440]  possible along every front now people can't do this all at once in every
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:52.360]  aspect but they can begin to do it and people are doing it in other words you
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:58.640]  live without the need of having the government and make your medical you
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:06.400]  know mega corporations be your kings and queens communities people helping each
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:11.000]  other people growing their own food people taking care of their own health
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:16.560]  people beginning to take back their own power and responsibility over their
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:21.080]  lives and this is a message that I mean this is not the first announcement
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:25.280]  this people have been doing this now for decades which is why the government is
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:30.200]  terrified of this because they understand this is the key linchpin that can come
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:34.640]  loose in their system of control if people just say well you know you guys
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:39.040]  are completely insane I can see it a lot of my friends can see it in fact
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:43.160]  thousands of people that I know online are looking at it all the time and we're
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:47.920]  decentralizing I mean there are now probably over a hundred private
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:52.160]  currencies in the United States I know of several myself they're completely
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:56.840]  legitimate in fact and they bring people into a completely different
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:01.200]  relationship with each other by actually producing an event and that's why the
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:08.320]  system is panicking now what about the issue of the fact that the globalists
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:11.720]  are now trying to psychologically inoculate us because they know that
[02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:15.680]  we've already exposed the eugenics plan I believe that's the main reason they're
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:19.280]  throwing it all in our face when yeah we're putting stuff in the water but
[02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:23.080]  it's good to die for the earth yeah we're doing that to screw up your DNA
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:27.480]  you're a bad human I mean they didn't want to come out with this now I I don't
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:31.840]  believe I clearly know that they're trying to titrate the dose of this poison
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:35.520]  because they understand that if we continue to wake people up at this rate
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:40.640]  there's going to be a more and more of a giant opt out of their system and as
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:45.320]  you know John it it's people don't have to fix the world by themselves like
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:50.120]  Atlas holding it up it's police officers quietly not doing
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:54.200]  unconstitutional things it's it's parents not fighting with each other
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:57.800]  realizing the system tries to condition to do it it's turning off and killing
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:02.600]  your television or locking it up in the cupboard it's growing an organic garden
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:07.120]  it's thinking about things I mean if the power of humanity is so great if we
[02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:12.160]  just start the wheels turning and we've shown people how to do that and as the
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:18.800]  globalist curses you know of degradation and and and stench unfold as the
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:23.680]  fruits of the psycho-new-world order unfold we're going to be like selling
[02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:27.760]  snow cones in hell brother do you see where I'm getting at that oh yeah
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:33.520]  believe me I see it very well just look at it this way your listeners people
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:38.280]  that have been on my website for years understand the titanic effort of
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:43.000]  essentially mind control that has been launched along so many lines by the
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.200]  controllers to try to bring people into line and what does that tell you if it
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:52.160]  takes that much titanic effort along so many lines then we must be dealing with
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:56.720]  human beings that have a resilience that goes beyond what ordinarily people
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:02.360]  consider possible that's right strength that is the strength and that is what is
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:06.800]  making them terrified that's why they tell us we're scum and ugly and bad and
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:11.560]  destructive because they know our minds design silicon chips and jet aircraft
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:16.320]  and Mona Lisa paintings and the wheel and fire and art and that we are an
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:21.080]  amazing species made in the image of God and they hate that because the
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:25.680]  globalist want to be God and they've got to turn us into scum animals so they
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:29.360]  can play the part of God when the truth is they're a malfunctioning form of
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:35.040]  human who are like cancer endangering the entire species you're putting your
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:39.160]  finger right on this thing and you can see it playing out in propaganda news
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:45.600]  outlets in culture in media over the last 20 25 years tremendously accelerating
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:50.960]  we're all ugly we're all debilitated we don't really have any right to do
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:56.400]  anything or say anything because we the planet has to be saved we're expendable
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:01.280]  we don't have any place here we're not really a part of all this this is just
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:06.160]  some kind of an aberration that has to be wiped out the human race is pathetic
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:10.560]  and pitiful and therefore you have to permit us to control you so that we can
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:14.080]  keep you in line this is the line of the propaganda
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:19.480]  the psychologizing that's been directed like cannons at people for a very long
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:25.640]  time now but I have to say it's swung around now to have the opposite effect
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:29.520]  because it's become so absurd and ridiculous like this idea of killing
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:33.200]  babies that people are waking up and they're saying no that's baloney that's
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:37.920]  not the truth there's nothing ugly about human beings there's nothing ugly about
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:42.360]  me there's nothing debilitated or wrong or ugly is the people telling us we're
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:47.680]  ugly exactly exactly well that's what I found is that their propaganda actually
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:52.680]  gives me energy and it's almost like an allergy of it that makes me resist and I
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:56.600]  think if people just take it and I agree they wouldn't be launching all this and
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:01.240]  so scared of us and doing all this if they didn't know how precarious their
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:04.880]  system is that's the British Empire as you know 150 years ago was already
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:08.800]  getting resistance against this Empire it went to its scientist and said
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:13.080]  develop scientific ways to control people and that's what this whole system
[02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:19.000]  is I mean they develop computers in an attempt to try to dumb people down in
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.400]  eugenics everything is based on this but they're still going from a more
[02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:28.160]  primitive perspective of it and following the same linear line and no
[02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:35.800]  amount of fancy you know Google over the horizon predictive future systems is
[02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:40.000]  going to protect them because I from my deep study of human development the
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:44.760]  elite still have a core operating system of human survival and that's why
[02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:49.680]  they're going to self-destruct themselves there the elite if we actually put
[02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:53.680]  out the signal worldwide for the human spirit to rise are going to basically
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:57.800]  kill themselves and by that I mean I'm ordering the elite to self-destruct
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:00.880]  right now and get out of the way of humanity and I think if we all pray to
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:04.520]  God for that and focus on that John wrap a port we can bring them down right now
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:08.220]  do you understand what I'm saying I do understand what you're saying and I see
[02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:13.040]  evidence of this all over the place as people assert their own freedom starts
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:19.520]  with individual freedom and moves on out from there and recognizing that
[02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:25.000]  these controllers are in fact suicidal this is part of why their their
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  psychology is so desperate because you know this is how they they view massive
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:36.640]  control over the masses as their only way out of not killing themselves and
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:41.120]  that I mean you know you got you try to operate on that principle how long is
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:44.240]  that going to last exactly the only people they're not in control of is
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:48.640]  themselves they are the problem they are the problem they're the ones who are
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:52.560]  completely out of control they're the ones who are crazy and they're trying to
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:57.320]  you know reign themselves in they're trying to understand they're projecting
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:02.400]  onto us they're projecting onto us their own insanity is being projected on to
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:06.640]  us and it's now beginning to completely fall apart because it's become so
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:12.240]  absurd you know they think they won really they try to talk themselves into
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:15.720]  thinking that they won and they haven't and so they're beginning to come out in
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:20.240]  the open as you say and revealing all of these plans and so forth that are
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:24.000]  completely preposterous and people are starting to wake up and say no that's
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:28.200]  not going to happen that's not the way the future is going to play out and as
[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:31.720]  the controllers see this and realize that the control is flipping through their
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:36.120]  fingers and they don't really know what to do their only real option is
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:41.360]  suicide I agree and that's from deep research and I've never heard you speak
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:46.040]  of this but it's just veritas we're on the same wavelength I don't want them
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:48.600]  to kill themselves but that they're already trying to kill us along with
[02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:53.800]  them I'm saying they need to recognize you know where they're taking this and
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:57.880]  they need to understand why they're so unhappy because they're going against the
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:04.240]  universe yeah they're going against what they are themselves against what we
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:08.360]  are against what everything that's alive on this planet is they're completely
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:13.400]  trying to you know oppose that and most of all they're trying to oppose
[02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:19.360]  themselves because they have been raised and trained to believe that absolute
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:23.800]  control is the only way that they can survive and that is totally insane
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:27.360]  because that you can't control everything but they're trying and they're
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:33.560]  failing and they will you know enter a period of self devastation where they
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:38.320]  just absolutely kill themselves off because they see no way out it's like
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:42.080]  you walk down this very long corridor and you keep telling yourself things are
[02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:45.280]  getting oh yeah I'm in control of this things are getting much better oh yeah
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:48.920]  we're doing fine and as you get further and further toward the end and you see
[02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:52.400]  the light at the end of the tunnel you realize that you've been you know these
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:56.440]  controllers that they've been diluting themselves all along and that what they're
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:01.120]  really walking toward is their own death that's what they're facing that's right
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:08.800]  they need to learn to turn loose yeah that to realize that if you let something
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:14.160]  survive on its own and have free will and independence it's not the end of the
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:19.240]  world but you know it's not destruction it's not automatic destruction these
[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:24.600]  people many of these you know elite controllers and you know we talked about
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:29.240]  what various groups they belong to and so forth have been raised raised and
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:33.080]  trained in mind control to believe that everybody else on earth is a machine or
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:38.040]  a lower order animal that threatens their survival that's their brainwashing
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:42.520]  and it's not working John Rappaport I've never heard such a veritas this is

[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:38.960]  awake and who have faced the horror of the globalist but also the incredible
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:44.880]  power of humanity is that we tend to get what I call or what they call World War
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:51.880]  2 target psychosis you get so close to it that you stop even care I mean the
[02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:54.840]  extreme of not caring how you look or how you're addressing or what people
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:59.040]  think about you and I tend to not plug sponsors promote books videos any of it

[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:17.760]  today I can feel it's all coming down to to to a crossroads it's coming to a head
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:23.680]  I can see it intellectually people better better do whatever they can now and
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:27.320]  make hey while the sun shines because the globalist are gonna pull out every
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:32.080]  stop in their attempt to keep humanity under their control and set up this mad
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:36.320]  scientist system I look at the art that the globalists are always into very
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:41.320]  very dark stuff very very disgusting stuff and you know I just know if we
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:45.440]  offer the alternative to that darkness we're gonna win we got about three or
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:50.240]  four minutes closing comments on that front John Rappaport. I completely agree
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:56.280]  Alex and people know this you know when you see something fabulous fantastic
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:04.080]  uplifting enormous in its impact you know you're alive you know you're free
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:08.520]  all this just happens spontaneously you don't even have to think about it and
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:12.760]  you realize what your life could be what your future could be and what
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:17.200]  everybody's life could be and when you then go back and you start looking at
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:20.720]  all this insane propaganda that's being leveled at people to try to make them
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:26.280]  believe that they're worthless and ugly and of no account and etc etc and you
[02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:30.120]  have to be little sheep but in our herd that we control you otherwise you're
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:37.960]  dangerous all this nonsense looks the height of absurdity and insanity you got
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:44.000]  to stay alive to that realization and go with it and not just fall back you
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:48.160]  know and sink down and say well I just had a momentary illumination but it
[02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:51.840]  doesn't really matter no that's what matters that's the thing that really
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:57.000]  matters all the other insanity and absurdity is just an attempt to paint
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:01.520]  an illusion of the world the way it isn't the way it isn't and to have you
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:05.120]  buy that illusion and you don't have to buy it and you know you don't have to
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:09.040]  buy it none of us have to let me ask you this why do you think we'll get a
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:15.040]  minute and a half left why do you think we're still alive well I think we're
[02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:18.840]  still alive and a lot of other people are still alive because underneath all of
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:25.480]  this madness and crime is the hope of everybody on the planet that we work
[02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:30.280]  this out and live the life that we can really live you know I've talked to some
[02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:33.880]  people who were former insiders I can't go into details when I have enough time
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:41.480]  but they basically said to me listen when we talk to you we feel better we
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:44.640]  feel better because you're not looking at things the way we're looking at it and
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:50.560]  maybe maybe we're wrong maybe we need to wake up you know and I think that I've
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:54.320]  been told the exact same thing can you imagine how alluring those of us that
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:58.840]  love liberty are compared to those that are turned over to darkness we have the
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:03.200]  power of billions of people that don't have a voice shining through us and when
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:07.760]  you become a leader folks all the good people's power begins to flow through you
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:13.240]  is that what you're saying and vice versa I mean it's an exchange yes it's an
[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:18.320]  exchange so everybody begins to say yeah I'm waking up freedom is the
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:23.960]  fundamental thing power individual power used for the good not to interfere with
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:28.880]  anybody else's freedom imagination real individual power is sharing power with
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:33.000]  others and lifting others up it's incredible amazing John thank you so
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:56.160]  much
