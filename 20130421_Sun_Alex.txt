[00:00.000 --> 00:07.100]  Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting network
[00:16.720 --> 00:18.820]  Waging war on corruption
[00:18.820 --> 00:33.380]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowars
[00:33.380 --> 00:39.580]  Well ladies and gentlemen Infowars.com and this radio show and my entire team has an
[00:39.580 --> 00:44.580]  incredible responsibility now more than ever
[00:44.580 --> 00:51.900]  the traffic on the site is quite frankly scary tens of millions a day pouring into
[00:51.900 --> 00:57.900]  Infowars.com alone right now instead of a million a day or so as is
[00:57.900 --> 01:03.580]  normally there so quite a responsibility friends family are calling me pointing
[01:03.580 --> 01:07.620]  out all the discrepancies that they see and all of this but Forbes has an
[01:07.620 --> 01:12.960]  article out saying we don't want to hear about conspiracy theories because it
[01:12.960 --> 01:20.900]  feels so good to have gotten the bad guys that guys I forgot to print that
[01:20.900 --> 01:24.940]  article you print me Glenn Beck doesn't know America click news it comes up
[01:24.940 --> 01:28.200]  because they're Glenn Beck says he's coming out tomorrow with devastating
[01:28.200 --> 01:33.300]  info to the White House concerning the Saudi Arabian youth and of course we've
[01:33.300 --> 01:36.900]  already found that the Saudi Arabian papers are reporting whether it's true
[01:36.900 --> 01:40.920]  or not that he has a bunch of family members on their terrorist list that's
[01:40.920 --> 01:46.340]  pretty hard to get on only 85 people on it in the terror capital Saudi Arabia
[01:46.340 --> 01:51.860]  and Beck's like I've got this that will bring down the White House Monday well
[01:51.860 --> 01:57.240]  we have it today and of course we had it Friday up on Infowars.com and and
[01:57.240 --> 02:00.700]  and look I don't know if this Saudi Arabian is connected anything but I know
[02:00.700 --> 02:06.900]  this there is a massive cover-up big shish on Friday or was it Thursday said
[02:06.900 --> 02:12.860]  oh drudge report has no credibility we're not planning to deport him and now
[02:12.860 --> 02:18.060]  it's come out in mainstream news not just Fox News that he set to be deported
[02:18.060 --> 02:24.980]  Tuesday and that Michelle Obama visited him and the Saudi ambassador dropped by
[02:24.980 --> 02:29.740]  in a really secret meeting but it got basically exposed it's called a
[02:29.740 --> 02:32.980]  walkthrough meeting where it's not on record I mean they're acting really
[02:32.980 --> 02:37.780]  suspicious and it's Saudi Arabians in the past that have been used as the
[02:37.780 --> 02:42.940]  terror cell controllers in these provocateur events in fact let me show
[02:42.940 --> 02:47.860]  listeners something here if you're watching on TV if not just type in mi6
[02:47.860 --> 02:53.940]  agent 7 slash 7 bombings terror expert London bombings mastermind is mi6 agent
[02:53.940 --> 02:59.320]  that's info wars calm from 2005 August 2nd but our article is just a London
[02:59.320 --> 03:04.820]  Telegraph blurb then we have the Fox News clip right there in our article 7
[03:04.820 --> 03:11.220]  7 London bomber was mi6 a SWAT and he was protected and he reportedly ran the
[03:11.220 --> 03:15.660]  Patsy's who thought they were part of a drill oh and we had a drill on the London
[03:15.660 --> 03:19.480]  bombing which witnesses talked about which the video confirms was going on
[03:19.480 --> 03:23.800]  right at the finish line with all these military contractors and people right
[03:23.800 --> 03:27.700]  where the bomb goes off and again I'm not saying they're involved when you
[03:27.700 --> 03:33.980]  studied these past ops they create all these fallbacks and confusion
[03:33.980 --> 03:40.060]  now you add to this that the younger Czar nav brother it climbs out of the
[03:40.060 --> 03:44.980]  boat and minutes later is the trickin a tracheotomy and and can't talk and it's
[03:44.980 --> 03:49.100]  now in critical condition dead men tell no tales and now it's in the news
[03:49.100 --> 03:52.460]  they're drugging him there's the hospital staff aren't on the globalist
[03:52.460 --> 03:56.180]  payroll they need to keep him drugged until they say he's okay and then he's
[03:56.180 --> 04:00.620]  going to be taken to a black site and he'll be given I mean you can give
[04:00.620 --> 04:03.860]  people amnesiac drugs that were easy to get with this prescription where they'll
[04:03.860 --> 04:07.940]  do whatever you want you can say walk off this cliff and if somebody four or
[04:07.940 --> 04:12.220]  five halcyon they will that's the stuff they give you to rip your wisdom teeth
[04:12.220 --> 04:16.140]  out you don't have to be put under but they could do a lot of surgeries in fact
[04:16.140 --> 04:18.940]  there do some plastic surgeries with drugs like that now where you're
[04:18.940 --> 04:22.420]  actually awake while you're getting them getting a breast implant job or whatever
[04:22.420 --> 04:28.460]  so all of that is going on and I'm just struggling here to try to go over all
[04:28.460 --> 04:34.620]  there's so many inconsistencies so many issues so many things happening but the
[04:34.620 --> 04:40.740]  big news on the Saudi Arabian youth that the White House is acting so secretive
[04:40.740 --> 04:45.900]  about and sneaky about is that the Saudi Arabian newspapers that we have linked
[04:45.900 --> 04:49.820]  up at info Awards calm are reporting that he's from a very wealthy powerful
[04:49.820 --> 04:54.740]  family obviously and has family on the terror watch list and just a lot of
[04:54.740 --> 05:01.100]  other stuff so it's all coming up today and then we're gonna look at Cispa that
[05:01.100 --> 05:05.580]  actually passed the house that is Russian or Chinese style net censorship
[05:05.580 --> 05:11.140]  and that CBS News's comment on it if you want an American company with American

[06:19.460 --> 06:36.620]  side you're listening to Alex Jones
[06:36.620 --> 06:47.060]  we're live ladies and gentlemen it is the 21st day of April 2013 on this live
[06:47.060 --> 06:52.580]  Sunday edition and today we're going to delve into the world of synthetic
[06:52.580 --> 06:59.780]  manufactured terrorism and who's behind it who stands to gain in the war on
[06:59.780 --> 07:07.620]  Liberty worldwide again thank you so much for joining us where should I start
[07:07.620 --> 07:12.740]  today where should I start I think I should start with this article out of a
[07:12.740 --> 07:16.860]  Hollywood reporter again Alex Jones here your host thank you for joining us today
[07:16.860 --> 07:25.820]  FCC blesses Red Sox player f-bomb he spoke from the heart video so normally
[07:25.820 --> 07:32.500]  there'd be a giant fine on the network that aired it and and then that would be
[07:32.500 --> 07:39.620]  passed on by the players Union and the league to David Ortiz emotional Fenway
[07:39.620 --> 07:44.820]  Park speech included the line this is our effing city but the government the
[07:44.820 --> 07:52.060]  FCC is deciding that's okay now now now quite frankly I think it is okay but you
[07:52.060 --> 07:58.500]  cannot then ever find anybody else for cussing during a family program like
[07:58.500 --> 08:05.540]  baseball as American as baseball and apple pie do you have a F this over
[08:05.540 --> 08:09.420]  apple pie and baseball do you do that at grandma's house no you go to a bar and
[08:09.420 --> 08:14.100]  talk like that or you do that on sailing ships okay if you're in the Navy and
[08:14.100 --> 08:18.780]  and again I'm not obsessed over people cussing but I'm sick of selective
[08:18.780 --> 08:22.660]  enforcement because I'm not a person that uses a lot of profanity unless I
[08:22.660 --> 08:26.540]  slam my my hand in a door or something then you will hear some but I'll get to
[08:26.540 --> 08:32.380]  sit here and have a whole person hired just to stand over a delay button
[08:32.380 --> 08:36.020]  and then we'll be hung out to dry and our affiliates will if somebody gets a
[08:36.020 --> 08:42.220]  cuss word out what if they're emotional again this is the essence of tyranny is
[08:42.220 --> 08:47.820]  when things are selectively enforced we have a county district attorney now the
[08:47.820 --> 08:52.420]  film has been released of her restrained drunk spitting on people driving down
[08:52.420 --> 08:56.300]  the wrong side of the road we had the Democratic Party here in Austin Texas
[08:56.300 --> 09:01.060]  says she will stay in office and she is above the law
[09:01.620 --> 09:05.860]  she had right at three times right right below three times the legal limit and
[09:05.860 --> 09:11.340]  again if I drink two beers and drive home they'll take me to jail but she's
[09:11.340 --> 09:15.620]  above the law so again this is the type of stuff I'm talking about and why did I
[09:15.620 --> 09:20.420]  start this incredibly important broadcast off with something kind of
[09:20.420 --> 09:28.020]  tertiary and tabloid like that because Glenn Beck who basically and I'm proud
[09:28.020 --> 09:30.820]  of this you know gets to show pretty much every day most of it for my
[09:30.820 --> 09:35.780]  broadcast that note for wimpy kind of mixes some of that in here is the Forbes
[09:35.780 --> 09:42.580]  article out today Glenn Beck just doesn't get America's strong character and it
[09:42.580 --> 09:48.340]  goes on in the article to say well Glenn Beck says he has proof the White House
[09:48.340 --> 09:54.500]  is covering up for a Saudi Arabian connected to terror groups and the Saudi
[09:54.500 --> 09:59.500]  Arabian papers are reporting that this gentleman does have connections to top
[09:59.500 --> 10:03.980]  listed terrorists over there in Saudi Arabia I don't know that's true I don't
[10:03.980 --> 10:06.780]  know this is a rabbit trail a distraction whatever but Glenn says
[10:06.780 --> 10:13.500]  he'll release that big bombshell info tomorrow now obviously Glenn who
[10:13.500 --> 10:15.940]  attacked me earlier in the week for saying that there's evidence of false
[10:15.940 --> 10:20.260]  flag by someone some other group involved in this not just these lone
[10:20.260 --> 10:25.540]  people there's lots of different types of false flags must have noticed that
[10:25.540 --> 10:30.960]  we're getting let's not exaggerate 15 16 extra million visitors a day just to
[10:30.960 --> 10:35.860]  info Wars calm and prison planet calm I mean go to Alexa calm look at the
[10:35.860 --> 10:41.280]  traffic it's it's like five times no that was about ten times the previous
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.900]  record traffic we've had so obviously the whole country everybody I know
[10:45.900 --> 10:51.260]  friends family people that have disagreed with me I was at Barton Springs under a
[10:51.260 --> 10:55.560]  tree with a towel over my head cuz I didn't want to be you know in the shine
[10:55.560 --> 10:59.640]  listening to people and they were all talking about how they didn't believe
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.020]  the official story and they knew about Oklahoma City being an inside job and
[11:04.020 --> 11:08.460]  Terrence Yakey the cop that discovered it who was murdered and and then I would
[11:08.460 --> 11:12.220]  talk to the people and they didn't even know who I was which is good news they
[11:12.220 --> 11:15.740]  already knew about all this stuff one group was a bunch of military people
[11:15.740 --> 11:21.360]  special operations with their wives and they were all talking and I mean there
[11:21.360 --> 11:27.460]  is a buzz on the street about this now Forbes says we don't care what evidence
[11:27.460 --> 11:33.660]  you have of other groups being involved Americans love a win it's like man our
[11:33.660 --> 11:39.900]  team beat the Muslim team beat the al-qaeda team our our team won you
[11:39.900 --> 11:43.460]  killed three people including an eight-year-old boy and you know what our
[11:43.460 --> 11:47.220]  police went in there and set up martial law and that's what we like the whole
[11:47.220 --> 11:51.100]  city lockdown door-to-door searches which actually kept the population from
[11:51.100 --> 11:54.540]  finding the guy and then after the prison lockdown happened martial law
[11:54.540 --> 11:58.340]  that's what it is I don't come out of your house and we'll shoot you a citizen
[11:58.340 --> 12:04.740]  found one of the guys hiding in a boat under a tarp after the quote lockdown
[12:04.740 --> 12:09.500]  that's what martial law is don't come out of your house or we'll bust a cap in
[12:09.500 --> 12:15.100]  your butt that's what it is it was just a giant ridiculous exercise and planting
[12:15.100 --> 12:19.020]  the flag on the Republic violating posse commentatis all of it and the
[12:19.020 --> 12:23.500]  system says hey America you had your big win so the baseball player he can cuss
[12:23.500 --> 12:26.740]  in front of millions little kids watching of course if your kid repeats
[12:26.740 --> 12:30.780]  that in school he'll be suspended or expelled or in some cases arrested but
[12:30.780 --> 12:36.100]  that's okay because this this is about feeling like we won and attaching this
[12:36.100 --> 12:45.520]  win this big win this big win to the police state and worshipping the
[12:45.520 --> 12:51.460]  government you know on average even middle-sized cities have spent under
[12:51.460 --> 12:54.940]  Homeland Security grants last few years you can look it up 15 million dollars
[12:54.940 --> 13:01.580]  per city for up to four Austin bought three of them highly expensive robots to
[13:01.580 --> 13:05.860]  disarm non-existent bombs but the Pentagon and and Homeland Security says
[13:05.860 --> 13:09.980]  don't worry it's gonna be an everyday occurrence every town in America will be
[13:09.980 --> 13:15.140]  attacked by IEDs improvised explosive devices I've been saying gee folks this
[13:15.140 --> 13:20.580]  is a more than 20 billion dollar a year rollout just for robots for four big
[13:20.580 --> 13:25.260]  defense contractors do you think somebody stands to gain by provocateur
[13:25.260 --> 13:30.700]  ring or setting a bomb and then I was reading where eight years ago Boston got
[13:30.700 --> 13:34.660]  two billion dollars over three years of taxpayer money Homeland Security money
[13:34.660 --> 13:40.660]  money they take from us and send to the feds to put high-tech cameras in now the
[13:40.660 --> 13:44.620]  answer is more cameras they're saying Peter King and other congressman are
[13:44.620 --> 13:49.300]  saying that's the answer now if you do the math they've spent
[13:49.300 --> 13:53.100]  wait for it wait for it guess how much the New York Times you can pull the set
[13:53.100 --> 13:57.620]  reports that in 11 years has been spent on cameras alone in the United States
[13:57.620 --> 14:05.480]  82 billion dollars 2 billion in Boston 80 plus billion dollars when terrorism
[14:05.480 --> 14:10.100]  kills less people every year than honeybees stings dog attacks football
[14:10.100 --> 14:16.260]  injuries go look it up I mean I've done whole reports on this showing you dying
[14:16.260 --> 14:21.980]  from terrorism is over a hundred places down falling in your bathtubs in the top
[14:21.980 --> 14:28.740]  15 thousands die but you would believe that the end of the world was happening
[14:28.740 --> 14:32.020]  because of the way they show the emotion there's a reason the Pentagon has pushed
[14:32.020 --> 14:37.420]  media not to show a 2,000 pound bomb being dropped on a wedding and killing a
[14:37.420 --> 14:40.740]  couple hundred people and little kids arms and legs blown around even in black
[14:40.740 --> 14:47.700]  and white infrared or FLIR there's a reason they don't want you to there's a
[14:47.700 --> 14:50.740]  reason they don't want flag-draped coffins being seen they don't want to
[14:50.740 --> 14:56.040]  personalize all that or you never hear about more troops commit suicide now
[14:56.040 --> 15:02.900]  then die in combat what is it like one out of six now commit suicide or saw a
[15:02.900 --> 15:06.420]  number even higher than that oh no forget about that let's not personalize
[15:06.420 --> 15:09.300]  each and every one of them and talk about how they're made to serve five six
[15:09.300 --> 15:13.420]  seven tours given deadly vaccines put on all these drugs let's just emotionalize
[15:13.420 --> 15:18.260]  all this oh so okay big win against al-qaeda here's the New York Times
[15:18.260 --> 15:22.660]  terrorist plots hatched by the FBI here's another one Al Jazeera u.s.
[15:22.660 --> 15:28.160]  approves additional 123 million aid to Syria and they go on to admit but they
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.420]  say it's good because Al Jazeera loves it so does Saudi Arabia that basically
[15:32.420 --> 15:37.500]  Al Jazeera promotes the TV network Al Jazeera says oh yeah most of the money
[15:37.500 --> 15:41.920]  goes to certified al-qaeda who actually fly al-qaeda flags and our government's
[15:41.920 --> 15:45.180]  given them 10,000 heat-seeking missiles oh you want more
[15:45.180 --> 15:53.020]  terror expert London bombings mastermind is mi6 asset oh oh a Saudi Arabian a
[15:53.020 --> 15:58.460]  swat from a big powerful family handled the supposed bombers who thought they
[15:58.460 --> 16:05.060]  were part of a drill that's Fox News AP Reuters London Telegraph from 2005 see
[16:05.060 --> 16:08.860]  it I know what I'm looking for because I've seen it about a thousand times
[16:08.860 --> 16:13.780]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the
[16:13.780 --> 16:18.980]  entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is
[16:18.980 --> 16:24.040]  to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the
[16:24.040 --> 16:27.340]  global takeover that's why we've assembled the most vital and important

[20:51.100 --> 20:56.180]  billion dollars a month transferred now for the last few years at offshore banks
[20:56.180 --> 21:02.940]  oh but that's not news oh look the scary men blew up three people give up all
[21:02.940 --> 21:08.940]  your rights will protect you believe us we told you about WMDs in Iraq and Bill
[21:08.940 --> 21:13.260]  Clinton didn't have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky let me explain something
[21:13.260 --> 21:18.300]  our government in the last two and a half years on record has given over a
[21:18.300 --> 21:23.420]  billion dollars to real al-qaeda out of Saudi Arabia Qatar and other countries
[21:23.420 --> 21:29.520]  to invade from three sides into Syria who attacked nobody and they are burning
[21:29.520 --> 21:33.740]  down churches and mosque and cutting Christians heads off and killing Jews on
[21:33.740 --> 21:37.420]  record every week the photos the videos and the foreign press it is
[21:37.420 --> 21:42.100]  unprecedented and they don't even deny that NATO runs al-qaeda and again here's
[21:42.100 --> 21:45.980]  the al-jazeera headline u.s. approves additional this every few months I see
[21:45.980 --> 21:53.620]  this 123 million aid to Syrian rebels who are led by al-qaeda look that up
[21:53.620 --> 21:59.220]  LA Times Associated Press and then I've got the New York Times terrorist plots
[21:59.220 --> 22:06.580]  hatched by the FBI it goes on to say every may every major foil plot or plot
[22:06.580 --> 22:12.180]  that took place in the last 12 years since 9-11 the FBI knew they word
[22:12.180 --> 22:17.620]  handled them and then gave them the weapons and then let them do it I mean
[22:17.620 --> 22:21.020]  there are real crazies out there my point is I don't lose my Bill of Rights
[22:21.020 --> 22:26.660]  and Constitution because you go out and do this so you get more power I mean the
[22:26.660 --> 22:30.100]  FBI has been run by Lacoste Inosa from the beginning I mean Jagger Hoover was
[22:30.100 --> 22:33.200]  on record you know they all those photos have him and stuff and gambling at the
[22:33.200 --> 22:38.220]  horse races and dressed up like you know Maeve West and everything and and and
[22:38.220 --> 22:42.220]  they told him on record he said in the 50s there was no such thing as look as
[22:42.220 --> 22:48.900]  organized crime now you know how stupid that is he called it a conspiracy theory
[22:48.900 --> 22:53.060]  so this is what's going on I mean I just read to you al-jazeera New York Times
[22:53.060 --> 22:59.380]  let me keep going what am I getting at here our government has now given and
[22:59.380 --> 23:07.500]  this is what's admitted in the last 20 years in the stands in Chechnya and all
[23:07.500 --> 23:12.300]  these other places where these brothers come from to destabilize Russia
[23:12.300 --> 23:17.900]  basically like Texas or something it's you right there in Russia's belly over a
[23:17.900 --> 23:22.100]  billion dollars again in just the last few years the numbers not known in the
[23:22.100 --> 23:26.300]  last 20 years and most of that's covert so we don't know and here it is brothers
[23:26.300 --> 23:32.740]  the brothers Czar Neve or however you pronounce it inspired by Chechen warlord
[23:32.740 --> 23:36.380]  on State Department payroll and we have the articles up on info Wars calm
[23:36.380 --> 23:42.220]  mainstream news going yeah they got radicalized by this guy the Russians
[23:42.220 --> 23:46.900]  came to the FBI two years ago to get it on record and said we want you to go
[23:46.900 --> 23:50.140]  interrogate these guys that are going back and forth and hanging out with
[23:50.140 --> 23:55.540]  these extremists who are attacking us by the way turned out the FBI was handling
[23:55.540 --> 24:00.620]  them five years ago oh and here's a big smoking gun for all of you and people
[24:00.620 --> 24:04.780]  are asking hey what's Alex getting at I'm just giving you the information I
[24:04.780 --> 24:11.180]  don't know exactly what's going on here all I know is every time there's a
[24:11.180 --> 24:17.740]  terror attack whether it's seven seven the London bombing or this CIA FBI mi6
[24:17.740 --> 24:24.860]  agents are running the people I just read to you Fox News from 2005 with
[24:24.860 --> 24:30.300]  Loftus the FBI former top counterterrorism head on there but John
[24:30.300 --> 24:35.000]  Loftus we need to get him back on she's explaining that mi6 basically ran the
[24:35.000 --> 24:41.100]  attacks and why would they do that gee I don't know if mi6 gets to double in size
[24:41.100 --> 24:46.300]  do you think people in the organization get pay raises I think that isn't hard
[24:46.300 --> 24:50.820]  to figure out and then they get to take everybody's rights and spy on everybody
[24:50.820 --> 24:55.340]  and and folks there's literally hundreds of these they declassified operation
[24:55.340 --> 25:00.140]  Gladio part of it about a decade ago in Italy Germany declassified some the u.s.
[25:00.140 --> 25:04.780]  is declassified a little bit over 200 bombings NATO carried out most the time
[25:04.780 --> 25:09.980]  with u.s. troops planning bombs all over Europe to blame it on political enemies
[25:09.980 --> 25:14.260]  I mean if you wanted to set somebody up folks go blow something up I'm not
[25:14.260 --> 25:17.460]  saying do that I'm saying you would go blow something up and frame them it's
[25:17.460 --> 25:22.340]  called a government frame-up of a group they want to go after but in this case
[25:22.340 --> 25:25.700]  they say it's Muslims so people go yay get the Muslims now the government's
[25:25.700 --> 25:32.340]  bringing in Muslims as fast as they can the target is you you are the target
[25:32.340 --> 25:39.140]  your tax money everything so my frustration here here are the headlines
[25:39.140 --> 25:44.800]  group linked to the brothers pairs specially trained for attack no doubt
[25:44.800 --> 25:51.420]  brothers not acting alone two from kazhika stand in custody Boston mayor
[25:51.420 --> 25:57.060]  acted alone he still hadn't gotten me the dumb mayor is still he's not in on
[25:57.060 --> 26:00.460]  it but he's still going with like Wednesday's PR that it was alone they
[26:00.460 --> 26:03.180]  were gonna come out it was a lone right-winger remember oh we've got word
[26:03.180 --> 26:07.860]  from Axelrod it's a right-winger but we exposed all the patsies with all those
[26:07.860 --> 26:11.100]  video and photos right before the bombing where you got feds just
[26:11.100 --> 26:15.300]  surrounding all looking in on three different groups of patsies the Saudi
[26:15.300 --> 26:20.820]  Arabian patsies might have been the handlers the
[26:21.460 --> 26:27.660]  chechnya patsies she had to and then the redneck patsies all there were their
[26:27.660 --> 26:31.020]  identical black backpacks with the silver stripes on them that we then have
[26:31.020 --> 26:35.540]  the shattered wreckage of and you were gonna go with that but it got screwed up
[26:35.540 --> 26:40.260]  didn't it and I'm risking my life to bring you this information you think it
[26:40.260 --> 26:45.780]  freaks the system out to have 15 16 million people a day now a day
[26:45.780 --> 26:50.900]  accessing this information by the way that's just on one of my websites do you
[26:50.900 --> 26:55.420]  think they're happy right now I can't even believe what's happening right now
[26:55.420 --> 27:00.780]  but if you go to drudge report calm group link to the brothers Oh out of
[27:00.780 --> 27:07.140]  chechnya and then in plain view that group is a creation for 20 years on
[27:07.140 --> 27:13.060]  record we have a whole article by Kurt Nemo filled with scores of links to
[27:13.060 --> 27:18.500]  mainstream news and and and from the White House's own admissions and the
[27:18.500 --> 27:22.780]  Justice Department that they're funding the people that reportedly train these
[27:22.780 --> 27:26.860]  guys that's what I've always explained here when I say a false flag it doesn't
[27:26.860 --> 27:30.300]  mean that somebody doesn't go on an Israeli bus and really blow people up it
[27:30.300 --> 27:34.940]  doesn't mean somebody doesn't really blow up US troops in Afghanistan but the
[27:34.940 --> 27:40.460]  up the chain there's big globalist that want to control America and Europe big
[27:40.460 --> 27:46.140]  mega banks that are sucking us dry who are funding radical Muslim extremists
[27:46.140 --> 27:51.740]  Mohammed Karzai globalist creation big corrupt guy he comes out though and says
[27:51.740 --> 27:55.980]  listen I just want my country back you're running al-qaeda and Taliban and
[27:55.980 --> 27:59.940]  blowing up your own bases stop it and see I don't just believe Karzai that's
[27:59.940 --> 28:06.420]  a fact that's a fact right after 9-11 all the major news reported the airlift
[28:06.420 --> 28:11.300]  of evil why did 40,000 Taliban al-qaeda leaders captured by US troops get flown
[28:11.300 --> 28:16.060]  out to safety into Pakistan to destabilize the next country they don't
[28:16.060 --> 28:21.460]  when I say inside job it doesn't even mean Bush or Obama specifically are
[28:21.460 --> 28:25.380]  running it they're just teleprompter readers above government are these
[28:25.380 --> 28:30.980]  multinational interlocking there are of a hundred biggest economies look this up
[28:30.980 --> 28:37.740]  more than 50 or corporations they're bit most of the biggest corporations are
[28:37.740 --> 28:43.980]  bigger than governments and and they stand to gain out of fear okay so when I
[28:43.980 --> 28:47.740]  get back I'm gonna go through the timeline because folks they ran a drill
[28:47.740 --> 28:51.460]  bigger than Dallas they were on it they were all around it and they weren't
[28:51.460 --> 28:55.860]  trying to stop it I'll tell you why they run drills when we come back to create a
[28:55.860 --> 29:00.420]  smokescreen so if they catch the operatives they say it's a drill these
[29:00.420 --> 29:04.540]  guys are double triple agents that's what the Israeli news is saying as well
[29:04.540 --> 29:09.260]  I said this back on Wednesday before they were even announced
[29:09.260 --> 29:13.780]  in the last two years alone the u.s. has seen huge losses to our food supply in

[33:53.380 --> 33:59.500]  gentlemen let me rob a a bombshell on you right now you notice the FBI came
[33:59.500 --> 34:04.100]  out and said here are the images here's the video of these guys help us find
[34:04.100 --> 34:13.340]  them help us find them on Thursday and now it turns out five years ago they've
[34:13.340 --> 34:16.660]  been casing them having meetings visiting their parents two years ago
[34:16.660 --> 34:20.260]  it's on record because the Russians called up and said who are you sending
[34:20.260 --> 34:24.180]  over from the State Department we want to file a formal complaint about these
[34:24.180 --> 34:28.280]  guys and have them looked into as terrorists like Russia doesn't know the
[34:28.280 --> 34:35.020]  State Department is sending over jihadis into Kajikistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya
[34:35.020 --> 34:40.620]  you name it I mean this is all on record the guy they got their orders from is US
[34:40.620 --> 34:46.180]  government funded man I'm sure sick of like bin Laden CIA and this guy over
[34:46.180 --> 34:50.420]  here in the end the end Kajikistan and Uzbekistan and this other guy in
[34:50.420 --> 34:58.540]  Chechnya Duko Omarov described as Russia's bin Laden and you know what I
[34:58.540 --> 35:01.580]  dropped a highway checkpoint cops want to search my car we're looking for
[35:01.580 --> 35:05.020]  terrorists I'm like hey the government actually runs them shut up traitor get
[35:05.020 --> 35:10.820]  out of the car it's all just a big excuse for a power grab we're the TSA
[35:10.820 --> 35:14.740]  and downtown Austin where you live we're searching your bags on a warrant as if a
[35:14.740 --> 35:17.880]  real terrorists just wouldn't come to the whole place where they had a
[35:17.880 --> 35:25.660]  checkpoint and blow that up they had 400 troops they had 2,000 police most of them
[35:25.660 --> 35:29.780]  at the finish line it's like every fifth person's a cop or a military person and
[35:29.780 --> 35:34.980]  then they couldn't stop the bombing so the message is you cannot protect me no
[35:34.980 --> 35:39.700]  matter how scary the media makes it sure it's one of the rarest forms of death
[35:39.700 --> 35:44.700]  but it's scary and you better be glad the government's spying on you without
[35:44.700 --> 35:50.860]  warrants cuz al-qaeda is gonna get you and now it's the terrorist out of the
[35:50.860 --> 35:55.780]  stands it's the terrorist out of chechnya and I'm like hey here's 50 news

[36:00.020 --> 36:04.080]  attacked us they're like shut up traitor you're just mad America beat them
[36:04.080 --> 36:09.300]  Muslims and I'm like America you mean the country conquered by foreign banks

[36:14.940 --> 36:21.100]  resources that we don't even get oh but don't worry did you see the video in the
[36:21.100 --> 36:26.740]  photos of the second brother the little ones standing up in the boat and then
[36:26.740 --> 36:30.720]  five minutes later he's traked and is in critical condition and he'll never be
[36:30.720 --> 36:36.540]  able to talk again and now they're saying he's sedated so that the hospital
[36:36.540 --> 36:40.980]  workers aren't bothered oh yeah and his dad's getting over here as fast as he
[36:40.980 --> 36:45.580]  can saying intelligence agencies were handling his kids well we know that I
[36:45.580 --> 36:50.860]  don't just believe his dad I've seen photos of these guys he was at school
[36:50.860 --> 36:54.780]  while all this happened still playboying around his brother was like a playboy
[36:54.780 --> 37:00.360]  guy wasn't a Muslim he was hired to infiltrate radical Muslims and he was
[37:00.360 --> 37:06.840]  sent to multiple islamo controlled countries or regions in the belly of
[37:06.840 --> 37:18.620]  Russia and that's all on record just like a SWAT look up mi6 agent ran 77
[37:18.620 --> 37:23.100]  bombings and you'll get Fox AP London Telegraph it look this is not me saying
[37:23.100 --> 37:31.580]  this I have a memory I live this over and over and over and then they go Alex

[37:36.220 --> 37:41.900]  did it no criminal globalist combines are funding radical Muslims and putting
[37:41.900 --> 37:46.900]  them in charge all over the world Libya Syria they're using al-qaeda to attack
[37:46.900 --> 37:51.380]  Iran I'm no fan of what Iran does but they are using five different al-qaeda
[37:51.380 --> 37:55.660]  groups to attack Iran they're turning Libya over to them Syria giving them
[37:55.660 --> 37:59.420]  10,000 heat-seeking missiles and you watch when they blow up our aircraft
[37:59.420 --> 38:02.740]  with heat-seeking missiles they're gonna set up checkpoints down the highway
[38:02.740 --> 38:07.300]  miles away from airports saying everybody's a suspect and you'll go but
[38:07.300 --> 38:11.540]  wait it was in the news our government gave him the heat seekers shut up traitor

[38:28.980 --> 38:33.820]  all that matters I'm feeling real good right now
[38:33.820 --> 38:37.440]  and then meanwhile I can't go to the kite festival without the National
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.300]  Guard wanting to search my bags in Austin Texas as if a real terrorist
[38:41.300 --> 38:44.380]  wouldn't just drive up to the line where they're searching people and blow that
[38:44.380 --> 38:49.120]  up they cannot protect you listen let's get this straight this is all security
[38:49.120 --> 38:52.480]  theater they cannot they will not protect you the only thing that will
[38:52.480 --> 38:57.820]  protect us is the original homeland security every citizen being armed since
[38:57.820 --> 39:02.080]  gun ownership was exploded more than doubled since 1990 crime rates have
[39:02.080 --> 39:05.580]  dropped 49% nationwide and the government doesn't want you to know
[39:05.580 --> 39:10.540]  those FBI crime stats can you guys roll those for TV viewers from fbi.gov you're
[39:10.540 --> 39:14.580]  like I hope the government lies those are local numbers all compiled the best
[39:14.580 --> 39:21.380]  stats out there now don't worry though his his throat has been traked and he's
[39:21.380 --> 39:26.580]  drugged now this is mainstream news and and they say they're gonna torture him
[39:26.580 --> 39:30.220]  you know it's time to torture they're saying in the news yeah show that show
[39:30.220 --> 39:36.340]  that show the teenager tells the truth totally set up let me I said this on
[39:36.340 --> 39:40.000]  Monday before it even happened before my show it even ended the weekday show 11
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.820]  to 2 central I said if they want you to be part of any drill saying you're you're
[39:43.820 --> 39:47.660]  you know you're gonna be fighting terrorists by doing this drill they're
[39:47.660 --> 39:52.700]  going to set you up not all the time but sometimes you're gonna end up carrying a
[39:52.700 --> 39:58.180]  bag to quote test security and they're going to blow you up and all they got to
[39:58.180 --> 40:03.660]  have is one globalist operative in a giant city-county federal drill where
[40:03.660 --> 40:08.620]  99% of people are Patriots trying to protect America I know these troops I
[40:08.620 --> 40:13.140]  know these bomb squad people they're off people I know are driving up to temple
[40:13.140 --> 40:17.620]  in Waco to get blood for this fertilizer plant these are people that really think
[40:17.620 --> 40:21.620]  they're fighting for America but you can insert a couple of operatives to load
[40:21.620 --> 40:25.580]  real explosives into the bombs during the drill then the double triple agents
[40:25.580 --> 40:29.240]  as the Israelis are reporting they find out they're being set up they have a
[40:29.240 --> 40:37.140]  firefight now now now let me give you the timeline here so you have the
[40:37.140 --> 40:40.740]  bombing happened on Monday and then the entire media says it's gonna be
[40:40.740 --> 40:44.900]  right-wingers it's gonna be veterans it's gonna be gun owners and then we on
[40:44.900 --> 40:49.340]  Wednesday get all the photos showing all these special forces and military and
[40:49.340 --> 40:54.100]  people all around where the bombs go off it's Saudi Arabians and what looks like
[40:54.100 --> 40:59.500]  McVeigh cutouts and all this so they say we've arrested the suspect and they go
[40:59.500 --> 41:02.840]  oh now we didn't arrest the suspect and then they shut down the courthouse where
[41:02.840 --> 41:05.540]  the guys had to get the media out declare an emergency and have the
[41:05.540 --> 41:10.580]  military drive off with whoever they supposedly had simultaneously you've got
[41:10.580 --> 41:14.420]  Saudi Arabians that we pointed out with bags right where the bomb went off we're
[41:14.420 --> 41:18.300]  not saying they did it and we're saying these they should be looked at turns out
[41:18.300 --> 41:21.820]  the White House is having secret meetings with the head Saudi foreign
[41:21.820 --> 41:26.700]  minister that's the head ambassador and that's like super high power about this
[41:26.700 --> 41:31.740]  turns out Michelle Obama is quietly visiting him secretly turns out they're
[41:31.740 --> 41:35.860]  acting very very suspicious and you've got Glenn Beck running around now saying
[41:35.860 --> 41:39.820]  I'm gonna release what's really happening well we have the information
[41:39.820 --> 41:46.020]  at in fall Wars calm this shoddy young man whether he's a patsy or not
[41:46.020 --> 41:50.660]  reportedly is very wealthy connected the royal family I mean shoot yeah he has
[41:50.660 --> 41:56.660]  like foreign ministers visiting him at the hospital this guy has six members of
[41:56.660 --> 42:01.100]  his family that are on the 85 person terrorist watch list that's being
[42:01.100 --> 42:05.660]  reported by Saudi Arabian newspapers now just like after 9-11 and they call it a
[42:05.660 --> 42:11.260]  conspiracy theory thinking you were dumb Miami Herald ABC news
[42:11.260 --> 42:17.180]  they flew out hundreds of the bin Laden family in the three days after 9-11 when
[42:17.180 --> 42:20.860]  all of their air traffic was grounded they would be loaded on the planes and
[42:20.860 --> 42:25.980]  flown out and not questioned because they're they're worth tens of billions
[42:25.980 --> 42:28.500]  of dollars and they're and they're connected to the royal family of Saudi
[42:28.500 --> 42:34.180]  Arabia and again I'm not even saying Saudi Arabia did this but at 15 of the
[42:34.180 --> 42:38.740]  19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia are they gonna attack Greenland or Iceland
[42:38.740 --> 42:41.980]  or maybe Canada I mean maybe I should bring a guys bring a globe in here when
[42:41.980 --> 42:45.100]  we come back I should spin it because you know when Saudi Arabia does
[42:45.100 --> 42:48.140]  something we attack somebody else so bring me the globe I'll spin the globe

[43:01.420 --> 43:04.940]  that we're not in Kansas anymore and I'm gonna go over the fact that the FBI
[43:04.940 --> 43:10.580]  knew exactly who these guys were the key Intel's coming up in the last two years

[46:20.540 --> 46:23.380]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[46:23.380 --> 46:27.680]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[48:38.620 --> 48:44.140]  pretty close to where I was saying nuke them Wow I guess nuke southern Russia
[48:44.140 --> 48:48.980]  because our government funded terrorists to go attack them and then some of those
[48:48.980 --> 48:52.660]  terrorists the US government trained came back and bombed us here let's spin

[49:43.780 --> 49:51.100]  Australian film crew asked Americans in San Diego yeah because they had this
[49:51.100 --> 49:55.260]  listed should they call this country al-qaeda on a map they said should we
[49:55.260 --> 49:58.580]  nuke them they attacked America and everyone they talked to in San Diego
[49:58.580 --> 50:03.540]  said yes nuke nuke al-qaeda al-qaeda stand they said al-qaeda lives here and
[50:03.540 --> 50:06.860]  they all said kill him so again that's why the globalist stage the terror
[50:06.860 --> 50:12.740]  attacks because they think you're a complete moron all right that's why they
[50:12.740 --> 50:16.780]  think they're safe to do all of this is because they think you're fools I mean
[50:16.780 --> 50:22.100]  look at this Boston Marathon bombs the brothers interviewed by the FBI in 2011
[50:22.100 --> 50:26.620]  they've been following them since 2005 but here's the big news I want to see
[50:26.620 --> 50:29.900]  if new listeners are smart enough I'm not being condescending to figure this
[50:29.900 --> 50:34.780]  out the FBI put videos and photos out saying we don't know who these people
[50:34.780 --> 50:40.860]  are please help us identify them and it turns out the two brothers had been
[50:40.860 --> 50:45.140]  flying back and forth to areas where the State Department is funding the very
[50:45.140 --> 50:51.620]  al-qaeda groups against Russia that supposedly trained them and you could
[50:51.620 --> 50:55.380]  even see in the videos the FBI agents talking into their earpieces as they
[50:55.380 --> 50:59.540]  walk by watching them so again they had a drill this is probably what happened
[50:59.540 --> 51:06.420]  to make sure that police saw so many black backpacks with the National Guard
[51:06.420 --> 51:10.580]  and Navy SEALs in plain clothes of black backpacks part of the drill which is now
[51:10.580 --> 51:15.660]  confirmed that they tried to deny that a real bomb could be slipped through and
[51:15.660 --> 51:20.580]  that's why you do a drill they did a drill on seven seven of the exact trains
[51:20.580 --> 51:24.820]  and exact bus attacks at the exact same time wait for it at the exact same
[51:24.820 --> 51:30.340]  location don't believe me go to youtube and type in seven seven drills you'll
[51:30.340 --> 51:34.860]  get BBC and ITN with the head of Scotland Yard admitting running drills
[51:34.860 --> 51:41.540]  of the exact same place exact same time being attacked Peter Powers and again
[51:41.540 --> 51:45.500]  it's like well why would he telling himself he probably wasn't involved
[51:45.500 --> 51:51.980]  he's hired to run a drill and then oh man again I've seen how they do this
[51:51.980 --> 51:55.980]  over and over again ladies and gentlemen here is the toll-free number I want to
[51:55.980 --> 51:59.580]  give the number out for you to be able to call in we're gonna open the phone
[51:59.580 --> 52:04.940]  system up right now at the phone system turned on in there it is eight seven
[52:04.940 --> 52:10.060]  seven eight nine Alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[52:10.060 --> 52:13.780]  again that is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine you know
[52:13.780 --> 52:18.780]  I could air Fox News Napolitano on Freedom Watch last year talking about
[52:18.780 --> 52:25.060]  FBI staging terror attacks I could air local Fox affiliate swan been swan
[52:25.060 --> 52:29.660]  covering it and I could air bit Dan Rather admitting the FBI cooked the bomb
[52:29.660 --> 52:33.700]  train the driver and gave him the detonators in fact I will later at
[52:33.700 --> 52:39.540]  least air Dan Rather and by the way he whitewashed it the Ahmad Salam Egyptian
[52:39.540 --> 52:44.660]  CIA asset didn't want to go to prison and he said look I'm not even really a
[52:44.660 --> 52:48.860]  Muslim I'm a secular guy you gave him a real bomb real detonators you're gonna
[52:48.860 --> 52:54.580]  let him bomb this he recorded the FBI he was the handler of the bombers who both
[52:54.580 --> 53:00.460]  had like 75 IQs and were on welfare idiots went to a crazy mosque with a guy
[53:00.460 --> 53:04.420]  Sam blow everybody up not saying these people weren't real crazies but the FBI
[53:04.420 --> 53:08.420]  enabled them and then let the bombing of the World Trade Center go forward that
[53:08.420 --> 53:16.540]  even came out in the New York Times I mean I watch mi6 double agent Saudi over
[53:16.540 --> 53:22.700]  the Patsy's on seven seven over a hundred of these events again New York
[53:22.700 --> 53:29.220]  Times terrorist plots hatched by the FBI this is because here's the deal here's
[53:29.220 --> 53:33.180]  the deal I'm the target you're the target they use all this to take our
[53:33.180 --> 53:38.380]  liberties let's go over some of these headlines Boston Marathon bombs the
[53:38.380 --> 53:42.580]  brothers interviewed by FBI in 2011 but they're showing you photos of them
[53:42.580 --> 53:48.260]  saying we don't know who they are help us identify not help us find them who
[53:48.260 --> 53:52.900]  are these people oh you don't know who your little pet projects are and you're
[53:52.900 --> 53:57.100]  so dumb you release videos showing feds and doorways watching them as they walk
[53:57.100 --> 54:01.500]  by and again I predicted Monday I said
[54:01.500 --> 54:05.620]  there'll be a drill there'll be multiple groups there four or five groups just
[54:05.620 --> 54:09.060]  like Oklahoma City they'll probably try to go with right wingers and they had a
[54:09.060 --> 54:13.100]  right winger arrested but drop the whole thing and and here's the deal be glad
[54:13.100 --> 54:17.220]  they moved on to the Muslim scapegoat because they want a civil war in this
[54:17.220 --> 54:21.540]  country folks and want to go after gun owners homeless kurti says gun owners
[54:21.540 --> 54:25.180]  and veterans and libertarians and Republicans are the new terrorist
[54:25.180 --> 54:29.060]  Christians are the new terrorists you've seen that mainstream news they want to
[54:29.060 --> 54:33.980]  flip the branding but they got so panicked by what we did at info wars
[54:33.980 --> 54:37.340]  calm and drugs report carrying our articles that they because the
[54:37.340 --> 54:40.340]  Democrats love to brag you're like it's a right-winger they've arrested him get
[54:40.340 --> 54:46.740]  ready press conference it got canceled because you couldn't have us announcing
[54:46.740 --> 54:49.740]  who your Patsy was before you rolled them out even though we had the photos
[54:49.740 --> 54:54.180]  didn't you and we need your prayers folks because they are hopping man
[54:54.180 --> 54:57.900]  believe me they do not like the fact our reporter took over all three press
[54:57.900 --> 55:01.860]  conferences and that Michael Savage agreed yeah it's good that info war
[55:01.860 --> 55:04.980]  said why were there all these drills and why were all these troops right around
[55:04.980 --> 55:09.940]  the bomb was Obama involved governments from the czars to Hitler to the Japanese
[55:09.940 --> 55:14.500]  government have all been caught staging events as a pretext to take liberty Gulf
[55:14.500 --> 55:20.540]  of Tonkin operation Ajax Northwoods Gladio it just got declassified last

[55:57.340 --> 56:01.260]  area and blamed it on the Christians and then they threw the Christians for the
[56:01.260 --> 56:06.620]  next year to the Lions and it turned out he wanted to expand his palace into that
[56:06.620 --> 56:14.980]  Greek area I mean it's the oldest it's give her to a frame up that's what this
[56:14.980 --> 56:20.340]  is let's get FBI interview dead Boston bombing suspect years ago Glenn Beck

[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:10.260]  you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:16.300]  from his Central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:23.260]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network okay so there is a
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:27.860]  major White House cover-up of this Saudi person then they may be doing that just
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:33.140]  because he's connected to royalty but his his family is hooked in heavy to the
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.300]  globalist notice that Saudi Arabia runs all the terrorists but they're never
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.900]  attacked because the globalists need the terrorism as a pretext for all these
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:45.100]  wars and to play off Sunni and Shiite let's go to James in Michigan and we're
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.700]  gonna continue with all this news as we move forward James thanks for calling in
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:55.500]  you're on the air sir hello Alex good show today so far thank you what do you
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:01:01.380]  think of so far you everything dad yeah I mean it looks really suspicious but my
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.300]  cousin found some information he's trying to get it to you he wrote an
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.860]  article it's adding more information that this could be could be drilled
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:14.820]  being run during the marathon well there was no doubt I mean witnesses on record
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:18.420]  track coaches you name it said they were told a drill don't worry about the bags
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:22.900]  it's just a drill which they used to make everybody stand down everybody was
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.380]  told show up with a black backpack so the real backpack could make it in
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:35.500]  exactly it apparently if you look up the title is was the Boston bombing a dry
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:40.580]  run disaster gone live he's got information in there links to articles
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:46.420]  that say that they've been using the marathon for dry run disasters since
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:51.680]  about 2007 we're gonna type that in right now was was bombing a dry run
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.980]  disaster but guys I forgot to print it Deb could file is from an Israeli
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.340]  perspective it's a bunch of Mossad guys and shin bet but I found it to be pretty
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.740]  accurate and even critical of Israel quite frankly because you know that's
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:08.500]  the only coin there is is being accurate out there they say he's a double agent
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:13.180]  that it was a drill and that he used the operation to set him up but it's above
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:18.200]  that of course the guys involved the Navy SEALs the National Guard the bomb
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.140]  squad weren't involved they're all standing around their body languages
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:24.620]  they're shocked we've got hundreds of these high def photos and dozens of
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:31.260]  videos I'm not saying their suspects but whoever arranged the drills did it so
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.860]  this could happen and of course it's a double cross but it may even be a double
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:39.660]  cross of these guys we don't know if any of this is true we just know all the
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.220]  things that have been present at the other events if there wasn't a drill at
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:46.860]  this and if there wasn't evidence of the drill and then the cover-up of the drill
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:50.820]  and then him being fine and then tracheotomy and he can't talk and all
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.740]  these other points and they tried to blame right-wingers I would say okay
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.180]  real crazy he's a tactist and then I'd say let's not give up our rights for
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:03.860]  three dead honey bills honey bees kill 200 plus but it has all the signs do you
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:09.660]  see what I'm saying exactly exactly they can use the drill the the website is
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:14.980]  victory post and that's exactly the point that he's making is that you know
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:20.500]  they can set up the drills and then it only takes a few people from the top or
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.700]  from the outside from the inside however you want to look at it to infiltrate it
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:28.620]  make it go live and then you know clamp down on the story put out one story and
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:34.220]  oh yeah they admit in 2008 they ran a drill there no I mean we have the track
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.100]  coach and now a couple others saying they were announcing be calm it's just a
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.700]  drill right before it happened and then and then we go to the photos in the
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.780]  video and there's the drill I mean it's just like standing room only of military
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:50.100]  police undercover people and then you've got the supposed bombers walking by and
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.780]  you've got guys talking in their thing about them looking right at them and the
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:58.740]  feds knew they were and said who are these guys can you help us not here they
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:03.060]  are we've been watching them but who are they we never heard of them but here and
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.900]  the Russians are like we know they work for you get it out of our country they're
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:11.940]  hanging out with your terrorist I mean this is so incredibly obvious anything
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:16.460]  else no he's just trying to get that article to you that it's no no
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:21.180]  absolutely guys exactly what I need is the link to another drill in 2008 no no
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:24.400]  what what the globalist can't beat thank you so much for the call sir god bless

[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.900]  following him five years ago and on record event when the Russians
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:14.740]  complained about him as operatives to the State Department in 2011 two and a
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:21.140]  half years ago the whole mo of this situation stinks to high heaven and here
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:26.140]  we have a Boston Globe article marathon is a dry run disaster drill and we know
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:31.460]  they were running drills we've caught them running the drill they've tried to
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:36.580]  lie about the drill the video and the photos show the drill and again drills
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:41.780]  are used as the cover story and then you've got the guy climbing out of the
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:45.380]  boat but he's traked five minutes later with a tracheotomy now they say he can't
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.380]  talk and he's sedated
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.700]  and they're like America's tough we're together we're gonna give all our rights
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:57.620]  up and have troops on the streets yeah that's freedom we're gonna be like North
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:02.740]  Korea and anyone who is it for it is a traitor papers please
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:07.580]  and every event it's been run by the globalist every event criminal elements
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:11.720]  in government corporations are funding and protecting radicals to do this to
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.980]  radically transform America what a dick Cheney right in September of 2000
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:22.900]  September 20th 2000 and PNAC online he said we need a new Pearl Harbor event
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:26.460]  roughly 3,000 killed I don't know how he guessed it so perfectly to be able to
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:30.580]  get America behind this Empire but it's a corporate Empire even if we got the
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:34.380]  spoils it would be immoral but we pay for this and don't even get the spoils
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:39.980]  now I'm gonna get into CISPA passing the house and internet censorship and all
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.580]  the other draconian things that are happening but you saw a major city
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:49.220]  locked down under martial law door-to-door and it wasn't till that was
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:53.140]  lifted that a citizen went out and noticed that his tarp was off his boat
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.660]  what a lazy person
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:02.100]  well no he's not a lazy person he was ordered not to leave his house
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:07.380]  in there watching television being brainwashed in a giant trauma-based mind
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:12.540]  control program then he goes out and sees the tarp and the bloodstains I mean
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:16.660]  government just grandstanding the security forces becoming the new super
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:20.700]  class they're not here to fight a real enemy that enemy is funded by our own
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:26.020]  government us approves additional 123 million aid to Syria al-qaeda al-jazeera
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:30.500]  this goes on and on let's go back to your phone calls let's go to Chris in
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:36.300]  Indiana Chris you're on the air welcome sir hello go ahead sir welcome yeah I
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:40.640]  just calling in basically same reason the other guy called in that was that
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:47.420]  article in Victory Post it basically said there's a 2008 Boston Globe article
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:51.580]  and had some other articles in there he covers from ESPN sir they were running a
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:56.020]  drill that day and then lied about it and got caught absolutely and they use
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:01.260]  the drill so that all the cops don't know when the real bomb comes in exactly
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:06.620]  then they change your story no no no listen if I had the crew but all you saw
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:11.340]  this they were going to blame the right wing axle rod from the White House said
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:16.700]  it that day they had the arrest it was a right-winger UT partiers did this but
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:20.620]  then we exposed all the photos of the Patsy and said he's a Patsy look at the
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:24.580]  feds watching him and they had to withdraw that and move to the back up
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:29.540]  the Chechen terrorist rebels they used to probably actually plan it who they
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:35.940]  always end up using to begin with go ahead no I totally agree I use those
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:40.500]  drills like that and basically I was just telling you about that the Victory
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.740]  Post article well hell it must be getting a lot of hits because everybody's
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.540]  called the last two callers were telling me about it thank you we have the
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:50.780]  Boston article that you're talking about of how they marathon is dry run disaster
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.460]  of terrorists bombing it and I guess they've been running the drill every
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:57.380]  year so they weren't too scared this year where they when the real thing
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:02.020]  happened that's how they do it oh this is just a simulation Jim Jones would do
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:04.500]  that simulate drinking the Kool-Aid hundreds of times finally when they
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:08.580]  really drank it they drank it and it's cyanide whether it be grape or cherry

[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:41.140]  brilliant but I want to clarify something that you've mentioned for the
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:47.660]  last two months and I saw the news story the same day that you reported is number
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:55.900]  of veterans are committing suicide per day I but nobody nobody makes them human
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:01.900]  nobody points them no no no no the facts I want you to further research it and
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:07.660]  here is my terms of research the number of veterans are killing themselves
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:18.100]  suicide which a tragic number is about 320 a year about 22 a month not 22 a day
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:25.140]  I'm sorry to report this but again I give you the opportunity to research it
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:30.900]  again it's been bothering me for a while here now all I know is they report it to

[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.780]  using this terror event I David Knight one of our great reporters from
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:39.480]  full-force nightly news has come in to break down the CISPA bill that passed
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:44.700]  the house that in the words of you and seen at news is Chinese or Russian style
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:48.100]  censorship just unprecedented we're gonna be breaking that down in this
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.820]  segment the next but briefly any points David Knight you want to make about now
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:56.020]  that it's because I you heard me here Thursday and Friday I said I hope it's a
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:59.280]  lone guy I wish it wouldn't have happened but let's hope it's not the
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:04.180]  government guys maybe it is real people but then it turns out CIA connections
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:09.660]  trained by somebody known CIA protected Russians saying hey get your agent out
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.700]  of our country that's what they're saying in Russia our media spends it
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:18.300]  they just ask questions about him protected surely had a firefight and
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:22.380]  they were being set up I mean this just always fits the same mo and I wish
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:26.900]  here New Al Jazeera 123 million to fund al-qaeda in Syria our government well
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.180]  you know there's the way 1984 starts out it says it was a bright cold day in
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:35.700]  April and the clocks were striking 13 you know something just wasn't quite
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:39.100]  right and and we knew from the very beginning that something wasn't quite
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:43.020]  right with this there were little things here and there that kept building and
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.860]  it's actually in the first day we were hearing people say they had
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.940]  unprecedented security at the starting line and at the finishing line and that
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:51.780]  it looked like they were having a drill and even the police chief said they were
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.540]  paying special attention to the finish line and that sort of thing well he
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:57.220]  wouldn't lie he went well there was something special but I'm not gonna say
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:00.140]  yeah so there's a lot of stuff like that and even as we look at the end story
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:03.620]  that they're giving us now we're seeing stuff about the brother supposedly
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:07.540]  tweeting while he was on the run as a bomber we see that he went to a party on
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:12.660]  Thursday night you know before they named him out as a the prime suspects
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:18.620]  and no one believes it right had the wrong color bag you know and now
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.700]  they're denying him his Miranda rights you've got and they're saying they're
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:24.860]  getting ready to torture him right and he's sedated right you got Lindsey Graham
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:29.340]  as I walked in here Lindsey Graham was on is either CNN or Fox and he was on
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:32.300]  there saying that he needed to be an enemy combatant in other words we're
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:35.420]  gonna give him the full get mode treatment this is what Lindsey Graham
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:39.220]  and John McCain and those people Carl Levin that's what they want to do and
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:42.860]  folks America is founded on the opposite they say well we're getting tough no
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:47.020]  they do that so they can make this type of stuff up when you let this happen you
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:50.580]  lose your rights don't ever forget it well remember they tried to blame it on
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:54.260]  the tea party folks you better watch your butt all the manuals now say tea
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:58.300]  party not al-qaeda that's right that's right and as we're looking at this
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:02.300]  there's we've had the press from day one say this is gonna be another September
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:07.060]  11th that's gonna be a foundational this will be the change right and we've
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:11.660]  already got something that's working on this as another Patriot Act and that's
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:18.860]  CISPA Aaron Schwartz who died in January 13th of this year hung in his jail they
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:22.540]  said it was a suicide no yeah right not convinced it was a suicide oh but they
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:27.140]  said right well you know he called it the Patriot Act for the Internet and he
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:32.020]  got very involved as an activist in fighting SOPA and PIPA and also CISPA
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:37.660]  and they stopped CISPA they reintroduced it Mike Rogers reintroduced it one month
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:41.780]  after Aaron Schwartz died and it is worse than it was when he was fighting
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:46.460]  it describe what it does because even mainline even Google admits it's the end
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:50.300]  of freedom I mean right well it's also interesting what their justification is
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:53.900]  I mean you look at SOPA and PIPA they were basically coming at it saying we
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:57.260]  have to have all kinds of powers to take websites down immediately without any
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:02.020]  due process it's the defense contractor take over the web break down the money
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:05.460]  who's given the money well the money is coming from it's interesting because
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:11.220]  Mike Rogers wife is a CEO was former president and CEO of Aegis defense and
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:16.100]  owns part of it still and she they just got a 10 billion dollar contract right
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:20.580]  and he's pushing on this and the stuff that he is saying is absolutely
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:23.380]  incredible in defense of it you know saying things like nobody objects to
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:26.340]  this except 14 year olds who are tweeting from their basement nobody
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:30.420]  objects because we're all mafia up here now yeah absolutely and by the way but
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.980]  it's also being outspent the the lobbyist in favor of it or out well
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:37.500]  notice that's what the bombings being used for is all this stuffs happening
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:42.500]  open borders gun control getting rid of the free speech is all happening right
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:48.860]  now you've got supporters have spent six hundred and five million dollars versus
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:52.220]  four million dollars people lobbying to oppose it that's a hundred and forty
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:56.460]  times more money the US Chamber of Commerce alone spent a hundred and sixty
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:59.740]  two million dollars for now why are they doing it well for corporations it
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:03.740]  protects them from any liability because what this is about the way this works is
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:07.780]  they do a very sneaky end run around the Fourth Amendment the government doesn't
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:12.860]  come in and say give up explain that the entire infrastructure you sign a contract
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:16.660]  that you can't even read or know or not Google still sells your data and then
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:20.140]  and then they hand it to the government that's correct and and there are a
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:22.860]  couple of there were two interesting amendments that were not even allowed to
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:26.300]  be debated one of them said the government cannot get information
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:29.420]  without first getting a search warrant that's the Fourth Amendment the US House
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.140]  would not allow that to be debated the Second Amendment said that they would
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:38.420]  that corporations will be forced to abide by any legal agreements that they
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.940]  had made with end-users so if you go to Facebook or Twitter and they say we're
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:46.060]  you know here's our privacy statement if this passes they don't have to abide by
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:50.980]  that privacy statement unbelievable any legal so it's Facebook that's a known
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:55.340]  globalist front Bilderberg front saying our users are dumb efforts yeah now
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:58.020]  saying they're gonna just take everything over this is the corporation's
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:01.580]  just absolutely in well they've always said they're gonna end the old free web
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.660]  and bring an internet to that's a police state that's right it's kind of a
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:08.060]  corporate internet fascism where basically the government can say
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:11.340]  technically they're not getting the information because and they don't need
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:14.060]  to get a search warrant because it's just being voluntarily turned over to
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:19.500]  them by these third-party corporations like Facebook when Facebook is you know
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.860]  all they have to do is and they give them liability so that they don't get
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:27.060]  any kind of kickback from from end users for doing that liability protection yeah
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:30.740]  exactly that's like vaccine makers have that mm-hmm like it's safe but there's
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:33.940]  liability protection and we pay out billions a year but that's classified
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.420]  and we already see and there's it's not a separate issue from this bombing thing
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:42.180]  because we already saw a quote from Mike McCall from right here in Austin Texas
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:46.720]  he's head of the House Committee on Homeland Security and he said in the
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:49.940]  case of Boston they were real bombs adding that we need to arm ourselves
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:55.140]  against digital bombs that are on the way okay so he's pushing for this and
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:59.100]  then our own government a few years ago launched ducks net and then you use that
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:02.980]  as an excuse to try to pass it last year mm-hmm like we're so dumb there's a
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:07.260]  stuffs net we need to do this and they launched it yeah exactly listen to this
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:11.280]  statement from Rogers he said they were asking him if the NSA was gonna be
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:15.240]  running this and he said well the NSA is not authorized to monitor this is not a
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:19.180]  surveillance bill then just a couple of sentences later he says we're agnostic
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:23.180]  on how the government would form an info-sharing regime somewhat DHS and
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:26.300]  someone others then two more sentences later he says and if you want the gold
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:29.820]  standard protection from cyber attacks the NSA has to be in there at least
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:33.180]  somewhere so he goes from denying that the NSA is there to saying he's
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:37.340]  agnostic on it to saying that the NSA has to be involved within it about and
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:41.820]  this is an admitted program from San Antonio to Salt Lake Utah they're
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:45.660]  building giant centers admitting everything's already being spied on they
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:50.420]  just want to be able to admit that it's now going on mm-hmm absolutely and and
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:54.020]  and notice how much Curtis says yeah your medical records are shared the IRS
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:58.220]  everybody gets them now Nixon was gonna go to jail for that yeah and now it's
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:02.220]  like oh we're keeping you safe from guys we funded now they're doing it to
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.060]  everybody Nixon just did it to one small group of political enemies now they're
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:08.660]  doing what Nixon did you're right we'll be back with more we'll break this down
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:13.100]  this is historical devastating events like earthquakes tornadoes floods

[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:12.380]  obsessing over terrorists you know back in the 50s and 60s they had hundreds of
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:16.540]  real communist bombings Patty Hearst was staged that that letter came out she was
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:20.100]  FBI but a lot of it was real and now they're in the White House that the
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:24.500]  weatherman but back then and I've read them the memos that have been
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.900]  declassified since the 80s they said do not talk about this cop that got blown
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:32.620]  up do not talk about the bombing of this building or that building it gives them
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:36.340]  attention don't talk about terrorism see if you're not the terrorists you try to
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:40.060]  play it down when you're the terrorists you play it up mm-hmm and they're
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:44.940]  playing all this up and while we're diverted with this and there it is DHS
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:49.100]  says gun owners are terrorists wow look at that headline I mean this is this is
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:55.580]  this is getting absolutely crazy you know we're even Fox News headline the
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:58.940]  Christians are the terrorists and then you read about these tell us about this
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:03.060]  defense contractor because we all these videos of defense contractors shooting
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:06.900]  people on the side of the road for fun and but oh they don't want that on the
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:10.180]  news they'll block that on YouTube tell us about tell us about the group that's
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:14.180]  lobbying to get rid of our First Amendment and our records let them be
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:17.100]  given to everybody exactly you're talking about corporations that are
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:21.960]  spending over 600 million dollars to get CISPA through and if there's taxpayer
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:25.820]  money they got before exactly they want your info it's about the military
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:29.000]  industrial complex and they're they're giving that in because they know they're
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.100]  gonna make a lot of money out of this and if you look at the foreign wars and
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:36.540]  things that have happened this Aegis corporation which the wife of the
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:40.420]  representative who's pushing this Rogers is really pushing CISPA he's the one
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:43.620]  that reintroduced it a month after Aaron Swartz why shouldn't you be able to have
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.420]  your medical records with no warrant why shouldn't you know what website you
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:50.640]  visit David you're on American America is about some guy's wife being paid
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:54.020]  billions to see what underwear you buy that's right they got a ten billion
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:58.260]  dollar contract with the government with the State Department freedom and she's
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:01.700]  all over this cybersecurity issue and this corporation we need to understand
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:07.300]  what its history is this is Aegis corporation is a corporation that went
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:11.980]  back to the Iraq War they had more soldiers and personnel in Iraq than the
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:17.260]  British Army did and Marcy captor who is on the House Committee asked you says I
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:20.860]  want to know how Aegis a foreign corporation was given a contract where
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:24.960]  now we have the second largest force in Iraq larger than the Brits headed by
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.620]  someone named Tim Spicer Tim Spicer has a very long history of getting involved
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:32.660]  in trying to overthrow African governments running hundreds of times
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:36.620]  literally over a hundred tons of weapons against a UN arms ban into an area of
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:39.940]  Africa he was being financed by a guy that was wanted for fraud they were
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:43.220]  trying to extract what's wrong with him having instant access to everything I'm
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:46.660]  doing online that sounds like freedom that's right you know what terrorists to
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:49.960]  get us to you that's right and then you look at other things to look at look at
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:55.220]  Mike McCall who is head of the the House Committee on Homeland Security fitting
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:00.140]  fitting representative for Williamson County he is no longer well I should say
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:04.540]  John Kerry is no longer the wealthiest man in Congress in one year Mike McCall
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:09.740]  as head of Homeland Security Committee quadrupled his network from 75 million
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.940]  to 300 million that's no big deal there's nothing going on there it's just
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:15.660]  going so I mean that's kind of like Feinstein going there with a million and
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:18.740]  now worth 150 million and as you're everything's fine and as you were
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:22.100]  talking about earlier all these different devices are being sold to
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:26.180]  police departments all over the country about bombs as if this was so yeah I
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:30.220]  mean I've seen numbers of 15 million this shitty 40 million that city for
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:33.420]  robots for the bombs and the feds are like the bombs are about to happen and
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:36.900]  it's the right wingers we're gonna have to arrest them I mean it's just a bunch
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:41.180]  of crooks coming in taking everything over I mean it's elementary they've got
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:44.380]  to have a few bombings to do it and don't worry but you know the Patsy
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:48.380]  climbs out of the boat minutes later is did you can't talk well let us chop that
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:53.980]  larynx out boy the longest time the military industrial complex has been
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:57.460]  profiting from our endless wars since World War two and now they're
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:00.260]  militarizing America and now they're coming here because we're the new profit
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:04.060]  center and in order to do this they need a Patriot Act for the Internet they've
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:07.020]  already had their other Patriots how do we beat this we beat it last time when
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.980]  it came out it was just the end of the fourth of them and everything how do we
[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:13.660]  beat it now when they obviously staged this event to get it through there's a
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:17.340]  major protest scheduled for tomorrow from anonymous is trying to organize a
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:20.860]  protest and by the way anonymous is hitting them hard they're bringing out
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:24.660]  the inside job stuff everything that's right they're hacking CBS News you're
[01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:29.220]  trying to get it trending on Twitter a lot of people are pushing it on Facebook
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:33.580]  basically what you need to do is use the internet to tell people how this stinks
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:36.780]  to the high heavens okay this whole system thing what's wrong with him
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:40.900]  getting 10 million so his wife can read my mail yeah Bill I think this guy I
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:44.820]  think Michael McCall's be able to read my mail it's billion yeah make sure it's
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:48.980]  billion people need to wake up and understand what this is they need to
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:52.620]  understand as an old wait a minute what's wrong with people private
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:56.340]  contractors foreign foreign corporations reading everything I do
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:00.740]  lifetime that's freedom buddy sure sure that's security it's safety yeah this is
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:04.340]  what Aaron Schwartz said about a year ago before he died they dealt with him
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:09.940]  don't worry yeah in his jail cell he said SOPA was exclusively about giving
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:13.300]  government the power to censor the internet but CISPA has the same kind of
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:18.500]  censorship provisions but is also more like a patriot act for the internet now
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:22.740]  you got to understand this guy they say he committed suicide because he was
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:27.460]  facing 30 no I'm sure they get me in jail I will never would they do they
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:31.060]  kill me folks well exactly he's not the kind of guy they murdered him he was
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:34.140]  taking this stuff on he was not afraid of this kind of stuff furthermore he was
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:37.980]  a leader as he got crit as as the attorney the US
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:43.100]  attorney that prosecuted him her name is Carmen Ortiz as she was getting
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:47.260]  criticism her husband tweeted that she had offered him a six-month deal and he
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:50.980]  turned it down now why would he go from turning down a six-month plea all he did
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:56.000]  was release MIT information paid for by taxpayers absolutely absolutely and they
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.260]  said here as they're talking about it they said state prosecutors this is from
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:03.740]  CNET state prosecutors who investigated the late Aaron Schwartz had planned to
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:07.580]  let him off with a stern warning but federal prosecutor Carmen Ortiz took
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:11.100]  over and chose to make an example out of the internet activist now she was also
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:13.700]  in this press conference that they've got it going on about the bombing
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:18.660]  because she's a u.s. attorney oh yeah person she'll be involved in this trial
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:22.880]  what's wrong with her reading your mail yeah exactly she'll show you what she
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.300]  did was she gave him 13 felony accounts and the point is is that if sure she
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:32.100]  taught him you listen listen you let him run you everything and you let him spy
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:35.680]  on you cuz that's freedom to keep us safe yeah absolutely absolutely they
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:38.700]  course they don't want us reporting that the US government funds the terrorist
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:42.100]  group that supposedly trained the Boston bombers and had a drill to make
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.860]  everybody stand out let's just ignore all that because you know they are
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:47.620]  announcing in Congress they're getting ready to take the pension funds and
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:51.460]  public the way to keep your pension funds is to lay down do what the
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:56.880]  government says and they won't devalue the dollar take your pension funds now
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:00.340]  good part about it is all you cowards that love this system it's gonna burn
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:05.540]  you down so love it and all you sellouts to it you're gonna get hung out to drive
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:09.700]  by your masters as well history is replete with examples man I tell you
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:14.540]  what a what a group what a group of trash yeah yeah and you keep seeing the
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:17.740]  same actors in this stuff all over Ken I mean it's just like Eric Holder for
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:20.340]  example I mean he got he's been involved in one of these big deals near the
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:24.100]  Oklahoma City bombing all the way going back to Waco you know it's when he good
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:27.820]  person on in right right Fast and Furious all this I mean so they had
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:31.620]  weekly meetings with the family about the boys but they put photos and video
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:35.180]  out saying we don't know who they are so the public could play along like we were
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:39.260]  part of it I mean I mean these guys probably had cement shoes a month ago
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:43.180]  who knows who the look-alike guy is they've got trait and they cut his
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:48.340]  larynx out on TV you won't be talking Mac but we really need to watch CISPA
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:51.780]  that's the next thing coming up and people need to get as much in their face
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:54.460]  about it as they did about yes what passed the house now it goes on to the
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:58.400]  criminals in the Senate that's right and here's the thing okay a lot of people
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.180]  wrote their congressman about the Second Amendment a lot of people who listen to
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:05.380]  us those people need to be just as concerned about a Patriot Act for the
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:08.620]  Internet and they need to write their senators and say you know what I'm not
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:11.620]  gonna fall for this left-right paradigm because right now a lot of the people
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:15.060]  who are left is still are on the left right I mean you had the guy who offered
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:20.020]  the amendment Grayson is very much look here's the deal they're already spying
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:23.220]  everything they want to use it and they want to be able to release fake stuff
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:28.540]  too yeah yeah yeah so it's you know you need to not fall into this left left
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:32.100]  right paradigm you need to be just as upset about your civil liberties about
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:35.380]  the Fourth Amendment being stolen as you were about the Second Amendment being
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:40.140]  stolen you need to go in and talk to your contact the senators because it's a
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:44.460]  better chance of defeating it and the Democrat Senate than we had in the house
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:48.500]  and by the way this is happening now can you come back on tomorrow sure it'll do
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:52.860]  it 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central David Knight info works out a news reporter and
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:56.460]  analysts here on the radio I know you only cover the tip of the iceberg let's

[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:40.500]  Jones and the GCN radio network you got a bunch of foreign corporate special
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:45.380]  interests that want to raise taxes on us and run our lives and get around the
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:49.060]  bill of rights and Constitution to dominate us they've got a lot of excuses
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:53.900]  to get that job done but the big story coming out the White House is covering
[01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:57.700]  up Saudi Arabian connections to terrorist groups I don't know that means
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:02.380]  this individual is a terrorist but there is a cover-up and that's just standard
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:05.700]  for some staged event where they have a drill to make the local police don't
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:09.380]  know what's going on they always do this and have a bunch of groups there and
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:14.660]  then who knows who really did the bombing but honey bees kill 230
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:17.980]  something people a year and terrorism kills maybe a couple dozen in this
[01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:22.940]  country maybe on average so why is it so hyped that's the psychological false
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:27.700]  flag Marcus Gary Ron Joshua and Joe I'm gonna get to you that's all we have time
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:32.940]  for before the transmission ends Marcus in Texas what's wrong with foreign
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:37.100]  defense contractors reading your mail without warrants isn't that the American
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:46.220]  Wayne go ahead well Alice extinct a high heaven well that sounds like al-qaeda talk
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:52.620]  my main reason to call in it's apologize to you and David I had originally called
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:57.860]  in the other day because I want to make a comment about how much Joe not look
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:06.380]  like Walter the gift puppet but anyhow I said on your show that that I was a
[01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:10.020]  little bit of a doubter and I kind of thought it was healthy to doubt things a
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:17.020]  little but now after I heard that the terrorist number one mother say that the
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:22.580]  government had been monitoring him knew about him and then I hear the things
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:28.300]  that I'm hearing today I just can't doubt I mean no no they visited her she'd
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:32.500]  she'd been upset that they were double agents I mean that's now confirmed the
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:36.980]  terrorist group the 12 member cell is funded by the State Department to blow
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:44.500]  up Russians this is a State Department terrorist period Alex waking up is hard
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:52.700]  it is because you know we're convinced and and well I was born 1952 in the
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:56.500]  United States of America very very good very wonderful country well the reason
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:59.560]  it was so much better than is you you couldn't find many immoral people in
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:04.600]  government now you can find a lot of them well I just heard on RT last night
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:09.740]  somebody said that and you know a trusted source that America it was now
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:14.820]  number one the most corrupt nation on the planet and that anything the
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:19.300]  government tells you is most likely a lot but it's not just America America
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:24.620]  was open and free so it got infiltrated by all these special interests that's
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:27.380]  why we're in so much trouble god bless you good to hear from you
[01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:31.500]  Marcus and no need to apologize man let me tell you I bust my brain trying to
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:36.540]  say this in an inside job the last thing I want is to go up against these killers
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:42.580]  I want things to turn around I don't want to believe this there are literally
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:45.820]  no exaggeration because I've watched them and did reports on them and had our
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:50.820]  YouTube censored over it hundreds of contractor videos or they just sit off
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:55.740]  the side of a Baghdad highway and shoot up a minivan and little kids get out and
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:59.620]  they shoot them and they fall down and a bunch of my British troops and they'd
[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:03.500]  laugh and then it and then they blow up some guy's dog and shoot him in the head
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:07.300]  and laugh and and then run over a family's car and then rape their
[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:11.620]  daughter and then blow their heads off and and you'll never see that on the
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:15.740]  news though and I'm like they're gonna bring these troops back here to America
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:18.860]  and it's not mainly our troops our troops aren't the ones doing it it's the
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:24.420]  mercenaries they take all the killers and they make a mercenaries I mean you
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:28.180]  can type in troops kill civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan it's the craziest
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:32.660]  stuff you've ever I mean it's they put Elvis music to it and it shows families
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:37.740]  just being shot for no reason and the guys all high-fiving and and they'll
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:43.100]  find like dogs and torture them to death on video and I mean it's just like I
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:50.420]  just can't believe it I can't believe it I just cannot believe it I mean torture
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:53.220]  and children to death you name it I've never seen anything like it I mean the
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:56.860]  devil has just been turned loose Gary in Washington you're on the air thanks for
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:00.020]  holding well first of all Alex didn't computer
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:04.340]  service well thank you sir welcome I saw you don't be an Anthony that was great
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:08.940]  you need your own comedy show you're really funny first of all I told your
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:12.980]  guys I had some Intel just so you could pull up on the screen on CNN YouTube
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:18.300]  mechanics saw suspect after bomb attack this is a guy who saw Jahar on Tuesday
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:22.860]  and he looked nervous and drugged up you remember that I don't but let's pull it
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:29.220]  up a mechanic saw Joe hard after but no such mechanics saw suspect after bomb
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:34.600]  attack this guy is named Gilbert jr. he's the owner of jr. auto body I got in
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:38.660]  contact with him after I heard this and I wanted to hear more about this about
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:43.420]  his drug habits and he said he knew he was a drug addict or not drug addict he
[01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:47.220]  used drugs like normal kids did in the neighborhood smoked marijuana and he
[01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:50.380]  heard that down there through the grapevine but I asked him did this kid
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:55.300]  look you know possibly you know a lot of adrenaline going through him or did he
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:59.980]  said he looked like he was on ecstasy possibly yeah well that's the issue is
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:04.500]  that it came out on the Mumbai attacks that it was CIA and they've been on PCP
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:10.900]  and had injectors of LSD and that's what they do it I mean I found the article
[01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:16.220]  you mentioned for radio listeners and that's exactly what they do go ahead I
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:19.980]  have his number I can give you guys to do an interview with him but he said his
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:24.420]  customer lives in the same building as your heart and remember he saw him on
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:29.820]  Tuesday a day after the bombing try to pick the car up so his customer who
[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:33.980]  lives in the same building as your heart said he saw him smoking a joint on his
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:38.660]  porch well that's why the father says that they've been kicked out of their
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:42.540]  country because they're not Muslim enough these guys are playboy rock and
[01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:46.840]  roll fistfights drugs I haven't even gotten to that I mean he was still at
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:51.540]  school the day before he got reportedly shot it's a timeline is wrong I mean
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:54.940]  how's it why would you go home and smoke pot I mean so what I'm finding what I'm
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:58.500]  curious is is why was he smoking pot Wednesday night at his home when he was
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:02.020]  acting all nervous too well they've got a bunch of cutouts they've used as
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:06.420]  intelligence operatives when you see these CIA ads on TV going any of you
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:10.340]  could be an agent or an asset call they're just getting a list of people to
[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:14.380]  set up basically but I'm sorry I have a number for you guys you guys can call my
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:18.060]  truck we're gonna put you on hold Chris I want you to call them right now and

[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:24.740]  I don't say this like it's some big thing to impress you it's like saying I
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:27.900]  had family that worked for Frito Lay or I had family that worked for coca-cola
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:33.180]  it's such a big operation millions of people work for it but I've gone to
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:37.020]  family reunions where it's like police military it's like East Texas folks
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:40.740]  that's all you do there unless you're white trash police military CIA defense
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:45.860]  intelligence and and they're just like don't ever get involved with the
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:49.620]  government they're running drugs and murder and everybody I'm glad I'm out I
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:53.380]  mean that's all I was ever taught growing up is the government is the
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:57.460]  most evil thing you can imagine because it's the worst people got control of the
[01:54:57.460 --> 01:55:04.860]  CIA because it's above the law and the stuff I mean it's like I'm not gonna
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:08.740]  tell you but let's say I made up a story about I'm running drugs and little kids
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:12.420]  you know I mean you know or let me tell you they run the drugs you know I mean
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:20.060]  that's basically it and you've got this naive public that has no idea what's
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:25.580]  going on no conceivable ideas so liming light we got the number I want you to
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:28.980]  call in and and get that because he's in the news I saw the article Ron in

[01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:01.380]  breathing false flag and I hate to tell you but there's more than one new world
