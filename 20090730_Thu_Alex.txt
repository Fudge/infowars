[08:00.980 --> 08:13.300]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:13.300 --> 08:30.900]  there is a massive buzz going on across the country and the world dealing with the so-called swine flu this genetically engineered flu they admit it's engineered to some land but they say oh that's a minor footnote don't worry about it
[08:30.900 --> 08:37.860]  there are resting people and detaining people and grabbing people off airplanes and locking down hotels and
[08:37.860 --> 08:46.980]  it's killed less than 200 people in the united states and less than a couple thousand worldwide and then every time you backtrack these death cases it turns out
[08:46.980 --> 08:52.820]  somebody died of a heart attack or died of an infection or died of some other flu
[08:52.820 --> 09:06.740]  and so those numbers are even cooked can you imagine though in the fall when tens of thousands die from the regular flu strange the amount of fear mongering that's going to go on
[09:06.740 --> 09:20.180]  and they've announced they're going to use the army to lock down cities enforceably inoculate and they're going to start with the police and the military and the firemen and the first responders and the school children and the pregnant women
[09:20.180 --> 09:37.540]  so that's all coming up with dr sherry tin penny in about an hour and a half and then we have some experts on the whole anthrax case the government launched anthrax attacks on 2001 and it's the anniversary of the murder of the patsy
[09:37.540 --> 10:03.540]  so we'll be going over all of that in the last hour today the film anthrax war and just a massive stack of important news also they passed 83 new taxes in new york state other states are passing scores of new
[10:03.540 --> 10:21.540]  taxes there's no way to keep track of all of it the feds are passing new fines new fees new regulations new taxes at every level and all over the nation i have several news articles today where thousands and thousands of businesses are behind on sales taxes or
[10:21.540 --> 10:39.540]  state business taxes or state business income taxes and they're just seizing them and the people are like i'm gonna have to close my doors i'm gonna probably close my doors anyways and they just say good close them they love it
[10:39.540 --> 10:59.540]  just like the soviet union this is a tool of neo feudalistic control they want shuttered businesses they want everything shut down so only big mega global corporations with their big glistening facades can stay open because they're tied into the big central bank money the 23.7 trillion that's been stolen
[10:59.540 --> 11:12.540]  they're flush in money and cash they lobby for more regulations and taxes to shut down their competition they love it it's fly paper to shut down the little guys
[11:12.540 --> 11:26.540]  you know the Rockefellers 100 years ago lobbied for regulations to shut down their competition but no regulations on themselves this is how the monopolistic monopoly capitalism system works these are monopoly men
[11:26.540 --> 11:34.540]  what did john d rockefeller the first say he said competition is a sin
[11:34.540 --> 11:47.540]  and the state of california the state of arizona the states many states are saying they're gonna sell off government buildings sell off roads just handing everything over for pennies on the dollar
[11:47.540 --> 11:57.540]  and now there's not even gonna be the services that the quote government gives you it's just everything's gonna go to the debt
[11:57.540 --> 12:12.540]  except for police and arrest and taxes and seizure of property all of that is expanding and anti terror oh there's plenty of money to train the troops to run checkpoints and confiscate your guns as in the military all over local news it's all over mainstream news
[12:12.540 --> 12:25.540]  now it's jones saying it's it's articles in iowa and articles in tennessee and articles in texas and articles in missouri and articles in california going isn't it great the marines and army are out training to take on the deadly militia
[12:25.540 --> 12:35.540]  oh the army's doing drills of checkpoints at the right wingers attack oh the youth brigades are training to take on the gun owners

[12:45.540 --> 12:48.540]  royan maryland you're on the air
[12:48.540 --> 12:53.540]  yeah alex i must have dialed in just the right time to be in the first up here
[12:53.540 --> 13:06.540]  um yeah i wanted to ask you about something you had made a comment maybe a month ago or so and i was wondering if you could get your own course you on so that your listeners could give him a history lesson because i don't know what's going on
[13:06.540 --> 13:18.540]  well i mean specifically what are you talking about dr. coursey i know he's running around talking about sonia so tomorrow trying to take over the states and these announcements of pro second amendment
[13:18.540 --> 13:27.540]  uh declarations in different states and her and holder out of control they both believe in total disarmament of the american people on record
[13:27.540 --> 13:35.540]  i mean this is a fact and no amount of hoaxing by the obama no it's saying your conspiracy theorist we don't want your guns
[13:35.540 --> 13:40.540]  just just just hand them over but but but but we don't want them
[13:40.540 --> 13:53.540]  well what i was talking about specifically is how that any criticism of you know israel attacking iran and he's saying now that you know he doesn't want him to do it but god said it's going to happen you know
[13:53.540 --> 14:03.540]  he doesn't even realize that jewish people didn't exist before the son judo was born to jacob so i mean listen i appreciate your call and i will get coursey on
[14:03.540 --> 14:10.540]  about a host of issues of course he's not a stupid person when he's invoking the bible
[14:10.540 --> 14:17.540]  of course he's a very interesting person so we'll get him on and when he's defending the second amendment or national sovereignty that's great
[14:17.540 --> 14:23.540]  uh i mean i think he's an ideologue i think he believes what he's doing but he's a classic right winger
[14:23.540 --> 14:29.540]  and uh let's talk to john in vermont john you're on the air
[14:29.540 --> 14:38.540]  go ahead john okay we're going to move on amanda in new orleans amanda you're on the air go ahead amanda
[14:38.540 --> 14:45.540]  hi it's so nice to talk to you um this is my first time ever calling in i just want to thank you very much for everything that you've done
[14:45.540 --> 14:49.540]  um i am a member of president planet dot tv and support what you do
[14:49.540 --> 14:57.540]  thank you um i just want to let you know that i uh can't talk for too long because i'm at work but we just received
[14:57.540 --> 15:01.540]  a work at a bank in new orleans and we received
[15:01.540 --> 15:10.540]  an email saying that our bank will be participating in a program to provide medications in case of an emergency
[15:10.540 --> 15:18.540]  from pandemics or bio terrorist attacks they're telling us that our bank
[15:18.540 --> 15:24.540]  will become a po d a private po d for our employees and their families
[15:24.540 --> 15:28.540]  they're wanting us to fill out our name date of birth information
[15:28.540 --> 15:37.540]  so that we can be first on the list to receive injections which vaccines or medications in case of bio terrorist attacks
[15:37.540 --> 15:41.540]  yeah this is how this is how the psychology works
[15:41.540 --> 15:48.540]  they they phrase it like it's some wonderful thing and you're special and you're getting it first and they have drills
[15:48.540 --> 15:56.540]  going back into january of this year where the police practice bringing in mock vaccines and guard them from the militias
[15:56.540 --> 16:05.540]  remember in indiana with the mass grave drills as if militias again are just wanting to kill everyone like some type of body snatchers
[16:05.540 --> 16:14.540]  or some type of you know 28 days later zombies that are trying to break into the compounds to get the wondrous stuff
[16:14.540 --> 16:22.540]  don't you forward that email if you have to later from another account I mean we won't show what account it came from to
[16:22.540 --> 16:28.540]  what's the best one to send it to you my heart so people can get it
[16:28.540 --> 16:32.540]  well you I mean there's five addresses there
[16:32.540 --> 16:34.540]  which one
[16:34.540 --> 16:41.540]  show tips and info wars and by the way we got a bunch yesterday from medical workers being told they're going to be given forced inoculations
[16:41.540 --> 16:48.540]  also in the news but it's good to have the internal documents where you can scan through those emails I know you're doing 10 jobs
[16:48.540 --> 16:52.540]  ma'am what are people saying there at your office are they buying into this
[16:52.540 --> 17:01.540]  well actually I work in the department that they get us to examine all the emails before they go out
[17:01.540 --> 17:07.540]  to all the other employees to make sure that the warnings correct and everything else and so I was one of the first ones to get this
[17:07.540 --> 17:16.540]  not everybody in the bank has got this yet but I guarantee you once they send this email out there's going to be people freaking out
[17:16.540 --> 17:28.540]  of course they're the sheep I of course am not I'm realizing what's going on and I asked my boss personally is this voluntary
[17:28.540 --> 17:38.540]  or am I waiving my rights by finding this information and this is what he tells me back he says it's all voluntary as stated in the document
[17:38.540 --> 17:47.540]  depending on the circumstances he says it could be a vaccination or medication and then he puts in quotations
[17:47.540 --> 17:55.540]  anthrax versus flu inoculation he said you can sign up for the program and take the medications if you offer
[17:55.540 --> 18:04.540]  to take medications or you can refuse the vaccine if you don't want to I mean look at the government totally turning us all
[18:04.540 --> 18:11.540]  into a hypochondriac people I mean ma'am did you might want to tell folks that that's an experimental anthrax
[18:11.540 --> 18:19.540]  shot that they've suspended twice over 15 years of the military because it has killed tens of thousands of troops
[18:19.540 --> 18:28.540]  and you can google anthrax shot killing troops and watch national newscast you mean they're pushing anthrax shots to through this
[18:28.540 --> 18:37.540]  bio shield program that is what was said that is exactly in writing and I will definitely make sure that I send that for your readers
[18:37.540 --> 18:45.540]  I mean I'm reading it straight from the email and once this email goes out to everybody in my bank it's going to be insane
[18:45.540 --> 18:52.540]  and there's going to be people freaking out but I tell you one thing if they try to come here if there's a you know
[18:52.540 --> 18:57.540]  of course I live in New Orleans and I've went through Katrina and all the other stuff with the
[18:57.540 --> 19:04.540]  with them locking things down and if they try to say that if we can't work unless we get this injection
[19:04.540 --> 19:10.540]  well I guess I'm going to be out of a job because I'm not getting an injection and neither is my children and husband
[19:10.540 --> 19:16.540]  well ma'am what they're going to do is they're going to stampede you and try to scare everybody but they failed in
[19:16.540 --> 19:24.540]  2002 and three with the smallpox so they're trying it again over and over again trying to acclimate people
[19:24.540 --> 19:32.540]  will you send that right now and chop off the top header and or if you send it to me I'll whack it out
[19:32.540 --> 19:35.540]  yeah I'll do small operations to it and block out my bank's name and stuff

[22:15.540 --> 22:17.540]  and escape the paper markets
[22:17.540 --> 22:20.540]  the only real option is precious metals
[22:20.540 --> 22:23.540]  for your retirement your kids education are just plain survival
[22:23.540 --> 22:26.540]  when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down
[22:26.540 --> 22:29.540]  you are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package
[22:29.540 --> 22:34.540]  and I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family

[22:59.540 --> 23:04.540]  finally in the news this evening it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China
[23:04.540 --> 23:06.540]  have now penetrated our power grid
[23:06.540 --> 23:12.540]  even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid
[23:12.540 --> 23:17.540]  some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[23:17.540 --> 23:22.540]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all in the dark
[23:22.540 --> 23:27.540]  are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts
[23:27.540 --> 23:34.540]  have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power
[23:34.540 --> 23:38.540]  if so this will be the most important information you have ever heard
[23:38.540 --> 23:41.540]  solar powered generators are finally available
[23:41.540 --> 23:46.540]  they have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever
[23:46.540 --> 23:51.540]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[23:51.540 --> 23:54.540]  that's mysolarbackup.com
[23:54.540 --> 24:05.540]  check out mysolarbackup.com before you lose your power
[24:05.540 --> 24:17.540]  music
[24:17.540 --> 24:24.540]  I got the guys in there digging through all of the showtipsandinfowars.com
[24:24.540 --> 24:31.540]  documents and emails and mainstream news articles where they're saying they're going to forcibly inoculate first responders
[24:31.540 --> 24:37.540]  now this is all color of law this is all fraud they're operating under united nations treaty
[24:37.540 --> 24:43.540]  and the level six pandemic rules that's why they've already implemented pandemic level six and then they can
[24:43.540 --> 24:49.540]  incrementally put in the lockdowns the quarantines the martial law
[24:49.540 --> 24:54.540]  and later I'm going to read over CBS news saying an associated press saying it's CNN
[24:54.540 --> 25:00.540]  but they're all reporting it like it's fun she notices the approval rating plunges as the economy falls apart
[25:00.540 --> 25:05.540]  more and more I'm beginning to really understand it is going to be flu that is the main false flag
[25:05.540 --> 25:11.540]  they may mix in some terror in most of the drills they have malicious i.e. gun owners
[25:11.540 --> 25:18.540]  attacking the flu workers attacking checkpoints trying to steal flu vaccine as if
[25:18.540 --> 25:22.540]  anti-neural order people are fighting to get it no we're fighting to get away from it
[25:22.540 --> 25:28.540]  but see everything with the globalist is the opposite everything is a twisting a deception
[25:28.540 --> 25:33.540]  and for several years they've been doing these drills and now it is just fever pitch
[25:33.540 --> 25:37.540]  the flu is coming the gun owners are evil they want to kill you
[25:37.540 --> 25:44.540]  mass graves are good and we break all the mass grave news and be laughed at and give you secret documents
[25:44.540 --> 25:48.540]  and then now it's all mainstream news confirmed again
[25:48.540 --> 25:54.540]  again I'm not saying it's a real pandemic they're saying it's a pandemic they're saying we're under a pandemic
[25:54.540 --> 26:03.540]  back since late April and I guess I should just drop everything and cover the police state and the pandemic
[26:03.540 --> 26:09.540]  because that is what everybody's freaked out about even the news is saying everything's fine take your shot
[26:09.540 --> 26:14.540]  it's good the army's coming to save you the public people that aren't even listeners of mine
[26:14.540 --> 26:19.540]  just mainline yuppies are starting to say I'm not taking it something's wrong I'm scared of this flu
[26:19.540 --> 26:25.540]  why are they hyping it up when it's no big deal and people are going wait a minute it kills 37,000 a year
[26:25.540 --> 26:31.540]  the regular flu this thing's killed less than 200 why are they why are they have emergency tents set up
[26:31.540 --> 26:37.540]  why do they have quarantine set up why are they why are they doing all these drills why is the army out running random checkpoints
[26:37.540 --> 26:43.540]  why folks I'm telling you Obama Obama is plunging the whole new world orders in trouble
[26:43.540 --> 26:52.540]  the Federal Reserve is on the defensive Bernanke's up there on stage in Kansas City being basically booed by a hand-picked audience
[26:52.540 --> 26:59.540]  they're going to pull a false flag and I and the flu I mean I've been saying this since March folks before it happened
[26:59.540 --> 27:08.540]  I saw the movement the buildup and then now like a bad dream coming true it looks like that's where it's all going
[27:08.540 --> 27:13.540]  we scream buddy murder and get the word out we may be able to back them off but Amanda's sending us that email
[27:13.540 --> 27:18.540]  other people are sending us documents we're trying to put some stories together on it
[27:18.540 --> 27:24.540]  there's mainstream news articles now saying they will try to force emergency workers to take the shots
[27:24.540 --> 27:28.540]  man I feel sorry for the police environment and medical workers
[27:28.540 --> 27:32.540]  Frank and Louisiana Frank you're on the air go ahead
[27:32.540 --> 27:38.540]  good to be with you with the Alex you know this is something this is so amazing
[27:38.540 --> 27:45.540]  I thought it was really picking up steam during the Clinton administration then it got worse during the Bush administration
[27:45.540 --> 27:53.540]  but I tell you in the last eight or nine months you have the tarp plan you have the stimulus package you have cap and trade
[27:53.540 --> 28:00.540]  now you have the the the medical they have bills to basically in the second amendment and they sit there on TV like
[28:00.540 --> 28:07.540]  parrots saying stand down there is no attack there is no bill we can read the bills all day and they just
[28:07.540 --> 28:14.540]  it is total Pentagon Psyop the Pentagon openly is taking over the Internet I mean this is just high treason
[28:14.540 --> 28:20.540]  man it's high treason on so many different levels Alex and then this medical plantation
[28:20.540 --> 28:27.540]  they are making their move I'm sorry go ahead you're right though they are making their move this is it boys
[28:27.540 --> 28:33.540]  they are coming in on us go ahead listen Alex this welfare this medical plantation
[28:33.540 --> 28:41.540]  as you know the drug infested crime-ridden welfare plantation during the Johnson administration that was all planned we know that
[28:41.540 --> 28:49.540]  and then people are missing something else just the last two days you had Obama and you had Hillary Clinton
[28:49.540 --> 28:55.540]  standing in front of this thing with the Chinese flag and the American flag tied together
[28:55.540 --> 29:03.540]  and Obama is stating that we cannot make it anymore without communist China and I don't know if people caught this
[29:03.540 --> 29:10.540]  no I caught it in fact I watched it live on C-span and almost fell out of my chair as I was sitting there eating dinner
[29:10.540 --> 29:16.540]  and it was actually a rebroadcast but I mean the point is I sat there and watched the unedited footage of it
[29:16.540 --> 29:22.540]  and that's the point I meant to rant and rave about that there are so many things that I see that I don't even get to
[29:22.540 --> 29:29.540]  moving so fast I mean this Obama is a speed demon I mean he's unbelievable what he's doing
[29:29.540 --> 29:34.540]  and they don't realize these bills are not written by him they're written by the foundations
[29:34.540 --> 29:40.540]  that's right and that's why Biden said after the election he said we're gonna be hated six months in
[29:40.540 --> 29:48.540]  because the public's gonna figure out this was a bait and switch I mean he is sledding our throat thanks for the call
[29:48.540 --> 29:57.540]  we're on the march the empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:25.540 --> 33:32.540]  to telling only lies Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[33:32.540 --> 33:45.540]  central standard time I'm here as my conscience see what an exciting time to be alive
[33:45.540 --> 33:56.540]  the adventure the danger the thrill my love is vengeance
[33:56.540 --> 34:03.540]  but I don't fight the new order for those reasons in fact I try to govern those emotions because
[34:03.540 --> 34:11.540]  we are on a planet hurtling through deep space circling a gorgeous sun
[34:11.540 --> 34:15.540]  we have an elite playing the part of a scientific dictatorship
[34:15.540 --> 34:23.540]  domesticating us dumbing us down like animals the planetary planners the world planners
[34:23.540 --> 34:30.540]  all I'm trying to get people to do is look outside the bubble look outside the controlled rat maze we're in
[34:30.540 --> 34:43.540]  see the bigger picture
[34:43.540 --> 34:49.540]  and I just can't believe there are these millions of people that serve evil many of them
[34:49.540 --> 34:56.540]  are not partmen wise but because of this show and other information now know the truth of what they're working in
[34:56.540 --> 35:05.540]  how are you part of something destroying your own future your own destiny hurting so many innocent people
[35:05.540 --> 35:17.540]  there's still time to turn back there's still time to get on the side of right like Saul of Tarsus
[35:17.540 --> 35:24.540]  pull up a dictionary or encyclopedia boil down of Saul of Tarsus
[35:24.540 --> 35:29.540]  maybe I should read that on there for all the souls of Tarsus out there
[35:29.540 --> 35:36.540]  I mean you really like working for the dark side you really think it's fun the way they treat you the culture you're in
[35:36.540 --> 35:41.540]  maybe you've never tasted love maybe you don't know what it is
[35:41.540 --> 35:46.540]  maybe you've never tasted honorableness and goodness and decency and truth
[35:46.540 --> 35:52.540]  the more I get into goodness the more I get into truth the more I try to train myself not to be evil
[35:52.540 --> 35:59.540]  because we're all evil at certain levels the better it gets the stronger I get the greater discernment I receive
[35:59.540 --> 36:05.540]  and I just feel sorry for you because you're missing out being on the good guys team I don't understand it
[36:05.540 --> 36:12.540]  you believe the atheist and the sociologist and the people that tell you there is no good there is no evil beyond good and evil
[36:12.540 --> 36:18.540]  but they all have moral codes as well they all have systems they follow
[36:18.540 --> 36:25.540]  they just want you to be rudderless they want me to be rudderless they don't want you to stand for anything so they can push you around
[36:25.540 --> 36:33.540]  these are great calls we're taking your calls I'm continuing okay I tried to take a bunch of calls in the first and second and third segment
[36:33.540 --> 36:38.540]  I'm starting to do it now I'm going to give each person about a minute or two unless it's some incredible caller like Amanda
[36:38.540 --> 36:47.540]  and you know it's not just that I don't believe Amanda I do I believe her the sincerity that it's absolutely true what she was saying
[36:47.540 --> 36:56.540]  but separately not just my discernment knowing she was telling the truth her inflection her voice the tremor in her voice
[36:56.540 --> 37:07.540]  the love in her voice but also the fact that I already know the banks and hospitals the entire infrastructure
[37:07.540 --> 37:17.540]  see that bank she's in has got one of the 56,000 and that was two years ago we haven't gotten any declassified leaks since then on InfraGuard
[37:17.540 --> 37:29.540]  they started it in 2002 with 1,000 corporate CEOs and officers corporate officers then by 2004 it was above 20,000 and last time we saw it in 2007
[37:29.540 --> 37:43.540]  it was 56,000 InfraGards with license to kill and they are even given computer homeland security logins with who to kill in the bank
[37:43.540 --> 37:51.540]  who to kill at the power plant who to kill at the Walmart oh yeah Walmart's at the heart of it up there in Bentonville Arkansas
[37:51.540 --> 37:58.540]  the FBI mentally runs their big underground computer system and it's InfraGuard now the last time I checked
[37:58.540 --> 38:08.540]  it was growing exponentially it was growing exponentially so I would say we're probably over 100,000 when we learn about InfraGuard
[38:08.540 --> 38:17.540]  when the numbers come out it's probably over 100,000 but we know 56,000 InfraGuard and so because they're in infrastructure protection
[38:17.540 --> 38:25.540]  your water districts the toll road companies all of them that's why they've got little private SWAT teams those are the new Merck teams
[38:25.540 --> 38:33.540]  and under their local managers control it's not just CEOs of their adjuncts now they have shoot to kill
[38:33.540 --> 38:39.540]  and that's why the Chicago police CBS News announced yeah if you run from us we're going to shoot you in the back
[38:39.540 --> 38:43.540]  doesn't matter if you're not threatening us
[38:43.540 --> 38:46.540]  CBS News
[38:46.540 --> 38:55.540]  remember the Ithaca Journal Ithaca newspaper private Gruckheimer comes back he's proud of himself he said yeah we do hunter killer teams
[38:55.540 --> 38:59.540]  we go into whole Afghan villages and kill everybody including babies
[38:59.540 --> 39:08.540]  and then Fox News had a general on a day later ago now let me clarify those are only in certain Taliban infested areas yes we kill everyone
[39:08.540 --> 39:18.540]  and went oh good good only in those areas everyone is killed they walk up to babies in their little cribs
[39:18.540 --> 39:28.540]  and they stick the nub of that M16 up there that flash suppressor and they triple burst that baby into Valhalla
[39:28.540 --> 39:34.540]  and why not they're killing babies in the ninth month they're in America
[39:34.540 --> 39:39.540]  Holdren says kill babies after they're born Peter Singer says that all the eugenicists say it and write books
[39:39.540 --> 39:48.540]  by the way I ordered more than 20 books and they just came in from Amazon of Holdren and Erlich
[39:48.540 --> 39:58.540]  I got more than 20 books two huge stacks of evil sitting in my office at home came in last night
[39:58.540 --> 40:07.540]  there's so much evil I can't even even people think I exaggerate they think this show is no it's it's 10 times worse than I'm saying
[40:07.540 --> 40:12.540]  literally I can't even describe to you the level of evil
[40:12.540 --> 40:16.540]  me tell you something cops and mercenaries
[40:16.540 --> 40:21.540]  I know you're not going to listen now most of you but when you're wondering why you're dying of cancer at 40
[40:21.540 --> 40:28.540]  or you're wondering why your five-year-old's got leukemia or you wonder why your 18 month old was walking around and giggling and laughing and talking
[40:28.540 --> 40:34.540]  and now sits in the corner drooling it's the shots
[40:34.540 --> 40:41.540]  you wonder why you're in a haze and your thyroid's all screwed up it's the sodium fluoride and that's a cover name for hundreds of different chemicals
[40:41.540 --> 40:47.540]  some water systems get a mix it's over a hundred some over 200 I mean I couldn't make this up if I tried
[40:47.540 --> 40:54.540]  I can't write 1100 page text bugs called eco science about how they're poisoned in the water
[40:54.540 --> 41:04.540]  and again I intellectually coldly track all this information work on stories and reports and I
[41:04.540 --> 41:08.540]  then I get on there and it just all hits me like a ton of bricks
[41:08.540 --> 41:14.540]  I just can't believe we're letting this happen I just can't believe that this is real
[41:14.540 --> 41:22.540]  I don't understand why you're in denial I understand why you don't want to believe this you think I want to
[41:22.540 --> 41:29.540]  every week or two you know I'll wake up not even with a nightmare I'll wake up sad
[41:29.540 --> 41:36.540]  I'll jolt awake at like 3 a.m. and just go my god it's real and just thousands of pieces of data
[41:36.540 --> 41:42.540]  let's have a brainstorm in the middle of the night and I'll just get out on my knees and say god give me strength
[41:42.540 --> 41:53.540]  and not shrink from fear it's of like sadness it's my god this is real this is really going on
[41:53.540 --> 41:59.540]  then all these people on petty power trips with that wild craze satanic look on their eye
[41:59.540 --> 42:03.540]  who've been sucked into these power trips the police and the bureaucrats and the government people
[42:03.540 --> 42:09.540]  and this whole petty system of this pecking order
[42:09.540 --> 42:17.540]  it's so scientific so crafted so abominable and so anathema everything decent and good
[42:17.540 --> 42:22.540]  Tony in Chicago where they're getting ready with mass graves and forced inoculations
[42:22.540 --> 42:27.540]  all of our Intel shows Chicago and New York are the main centers
[42:27.540 --> 42:32.540]  where they'll beta test locking down cities and forced inoculations this won't be the big one
[42:32.540 --> 42:38.540]  this is just a training op it'll be bad but I believe this is just a mass live action training op
[42:38.540 --> 42:43.540]  for the real soft kills to come but Tony in Chicago go ahead

[44:09.540 --> 44:15.540]  you a ray of hope from the happy hunting grounds up here I spend a lot I spend I spend some
[44:15.540 --> 44:21.540]  significant time in the south side Chicago dealing with shadier variety of people and
[44:21.540 --> 44:26.540]  they're not fooled by the Obama deception they are not tricked they that you know the majority
[44:26.540 --> 44:32.540]  of people I talk to they're not buying it hey it's not black folks that are mainly buying
[44:32.540 --> 44:39.540]  his baloney now it is yuppies it is yuppies I've been doing a lot of liberal radio interviews
[44:39.540 --> 44:43.540]  in fact maybe later if we get the clips I'll play some from 1360 up in Dallas I was on
[44:43.540 --> 44:48.540]  for 45 minutes yesterday and I would sit there and say there's eugenics Holdren wants to
[44:48.540 --> 44:53.540]  poison your water here's the textbook the whole thing is scanned in and we have links to
[44:53.540 --> 44:58.540]  university copies of it free online and info wars dot com and this lady called in and said
[44:58.540 --> 45:05.540]  you're a racist and she did sound like she was black but I mean it's just unbelievable

[45:10.540 --> 45:16.540]  I'm down in the I'll be on the south side all over the suburbs actually on my I won't lie
[45:16.540 --> 45:22.540]  to you I have to have a distraction it's my Xbox live people on Xbox live they're waking
[45:22.540 --> 45:28.540]  up Alex they're hearing about the Fed they're talking about the Fed people that I you know
[45:28.540 --> 45:32.540]  a year and a half ago didn't know there was actually you mean there's a house a Senate
[45:32.540 --> 45:38.540]  and you know executive that are just now there is Ron Paul it's the Federal Reserve they're
[45:38.540 --> 45:43.540]  not going to have the time they think they're going to have they're not they know that's
[45:43.540 --> 45:49.540]  why they may not even release a soft kill they might me tell you these people are unlimited
[45:49.540 --> 45:55.540]  evil okay they aren't they are they write books Brzezinski again has written several books
[45:55.540 --> 46:02.540]  we've quoted him here in fact pull up was Bosigny Brzezinski quotes on Pol Pot and he
[46:02.540 --> 46:09.540]  brags that he helped Pol Pot kill three million thirty percent and that's why they honor him
[46:09.540 --> 46:14.540]  when he walks in a room the globalists begin looking at because they're psychos and to them
[46:14.540 --> 46:21.540]  it's like he's a God because he's got that many you know to them dead spirits basically attached
[46:21.540 --> 46:27.540]  to his mojo and I'm not kidding that's how these people roll you can't you the more you
[46:27.540 --> 46:35.540]  research them they are hellraiser type creatures and I mean folks they'll they will they will
[46:35.540 --> 46:41.540]  they oh my god but yes you're right it is so exciting that people now know about the
[46:41.540 --> 46:46.540]  new world order and I agree it is blowing up in their face God bless you good to hear
[46:46.540 --> 46:53.540]  from you Tony Steven Chicago go ahead Steve you're on the air well I hate to break the
[46:53.540 --> 46:59.540]  continuity Alex but I want to say that I'm for the shoot to kill order I remember the
[46:59.540 --> 47:05.540]  1969 King riots on the West Side West Side and that's what old Mayor Daley said and it
[47:05.540 --> 47:10.540]  stopped the riots they stopped to burn it now the reason why I called up as a beer can
[47:10.540 --> 47:16.540]  as you know today there's that Cambridge police sergeant who's meeting with this is the colored
[47:16.540 --> 47:22.540]  professor at the White House now the situation is Obama jumped in right away and he said
[47:22.540 --> 47:27.540]  well I think it's a stupid idea for the police to enforce law and order we used to have law
[47:27.540 --> 47:33.540]  and order in the 1960s we don't have it anymore but the point being Obama didn't say well
[47:33.540 --> 47:38.540]  look I had almost 20 traffic tickets from Cambridge Massachusetts when I was a Harvard
[47:38.540 --> 47:42.540]  law student there and I graduated Harvard Law School of course I skipped out on those
[47:42.540 --> 47:49.540]  tickets nor did he say he didn't pay his Chicago police department traffic tickets either now
[47:49.540 --> 47:55.540]  the point being I'm just in the court I'm actually kind of liking him now well the point
[47:55.540 --> 48:02.540]  I was in the court just two and a half weeks ago on one single seat belt and if you get
[48:02.540 --> 48:07.540]  a doctor's note and it's the same thing I looked it up in Texas the Texas public safety law
[48:07.540 --> 48:11.540]  and you get a doctor's note you go to court that you can't wear a belt for medical reasons
[48:11.540 --> 48:17.540]  they throw it out so they that's what they did listen Steve Steve Steve we're talking
[48:17.540 --> 48:23.540]  about global pandemic new world order drugging the water supply world government and you're
[48:23.540 --> 48:28.540]  calling in about the political race football that they're staging with these police and
[48:28.540 --> 48:35.540]  this professor and Obama they want to distract everybody off the bank stealing 23.7 trillion
[48:35.540 --> 48:44.540]  dollars and ruining ruining all of our futures and oh man I mean Steve what is the point of
[48:44.540 --> 48:49.540]  all of this every you know you call every few weeks and it's always about race you are
[48:49.540 --> 48:58.540]  just obsessed with it well Alex the handler for Obama and Deval Patrick who's the governor
[48:58.540 --> 49:07.540]  is Axelrod this is this is a pack of criminals it's a pack of slime bag Chicago crime machine
[49:07.540 --> 49:11.540]  but sounds like you like the daily machine you're just telling us how great the old man
[49:11.540 --> 49:16.540]  was well he kept law and order in the city during my god that's what the mafia always
[49:16.540 --> 49:21.540]  does they run the larger crime syndicate and they allow the crime to operate and then look
[49:21.540 --> 49:27.540]  nice to talk to you pal I just can't hear how Mayor Daley's a great guy that pimp they
[49:27.540 --> 49:33.540]  run your guns the crime rate explodes then they run around it's just like the mafia says
[49:33.540 --> 49:37.540]  pay me insurance money or somebody's going to burn down your grocery store I'm not going
[49:37.540 --> 49:41.540]  to burn it down but I know the guy that might do it so you need to pay me protection in
[49:41.540 --> 49:47.540]  fact there's a famous clip of a whole band daily going the police aren't here to stop
[49:47.540 --> 49:55.540]  crime the police here to help push the crime I mean oh my god ladies and gentlemen it makes

[55:50.540 --> 55:56.540]  let them label the truth is fringe or weird we force the truth out into the mainstream
[55:56.540 --> 56:02.540]  we become the mainstream and we do that by not caring what these followers think and say
[56:02.540 --> 56:11.540]  we do it by being leaders so the globalist desperately want to change the subject the

[1:02:09.540 --> 1:02:14.540]  parents that taught me to read history books and taught me about history and that loved
[1:02:14.540 --> 1:02:18.540]  me and that you know i again i thought that my parents were just normal and everybody
[1:02:18.540 --> 1:02:29.540]  was like my family and i didn't know that kind of my whole puritan family lineage and i'm
[1:02:29.540 --> 1:02:32.540]  not saying i had a perfect family going back through history but looking back on my
[1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:37.540]  forebears my ancestors i come from pretty good people pretty good hard working people
[1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:41.540]  that always stood up to evil over and over again and i didn't realize that a lot of
[1:02:41.540 --> 1:02:46.540]  people come from scum they enjoy evil they enjoy screwing other people they enjoy being
[1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:51.540]  bullies and as i grew up i began to realize that but i am just so thankful that i woke
[1:02:51.540 --> 1:02:59.540]  up to this early i'd say when i was about 16 years old it wasn't even waking up we
[1:02:59.540 --> 1:03:04.540]  did an interview with alan watt in canada coming up the new obama film and he made
[1:03:04.540 --> 1:03:09.540]  a point you know we asked him when well i can't really get into canada they had me on
[1:03:09.540 --> 1:03:14.540]  a terror list basically so my team got in and barely but um we asked him when did you
[1:03:14.540 --> 1:03:19.540]  wake up and he said i was born awake everybody just knew it where he grew up in a bad part
[1:03:19.540 --> 1:03:24.540]  of town in the poor part of town in london everybody knew the system was cheating you
[1:03:24.540 --> 1:03:31.540]  and lying and scamming and it was a new world order and i grew up middle class but reading
[1:03:31.540 --> 1:03:36.540]  history and being informed everybody you just know that old timers all just knew this so
[1:03:36.540 --> 1:03:43.540]  i really was brought up awake i just didn't realize that other people weren't awake i
[1:03:43.540 --> 1:03:50.540]  didn't and i didn't take seriously the history i didn't realize my duty to fight the evil
[1:03:50.540 --> 1:03:56.540]  but yeah no i was i wasn't born awake but i was born into people that were awake and
[1:03:56.540 --> 1:04:00.540]  not people that were awake and really active i mean you know my dad's idea of being active
[1:04:00.540 --> 1:04:05.540]  was stopping and helping every person he saw change tires we'd say no don't stop we want
[1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:10.540]  to go eat or you know we're on a road trip we want to get to you know to the national
[1:04:10.540 --> 1:04:15.540]  park don't he'd pull over and help him and then sometimes they'd be crazy people sometimes
[1:04:15.540 --> 1:04:20.540]  they'd be scammers sometimes they'd be and you know society's so corrupt and evil now
[1:04:20.540 --> 1:04:24.540]  my dad like ten years ago tried to stop somebody and help him and they tried to jump him and
[1:04:24.540 --> 1:04:31.540]  rob him it was a scam and so you know he doesn't do that anymore see evil has a way of taking
[1:04:31.540 --> 1:04:37.540]  over and then it pushes good people back and makes us kind of give up no the answer is
[1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:42.540]  not pulling your feelers back but getting more out there when evil starts trying to push
[1:04:42.540 --> 1:04:52.540]  you around you got to you got to step in even stronger you got to take the ground you got

[1:08:49.540 --> 1:08:54.540]  accident showed up in dozens of locations in one day by accident released from port and
[1:08:54.540 --> 1:09:00.540]  down military to work with FEMA during swine flu pandemic prison planet dot com according

[1:09:31.540 --> 1:09:38.540]  casting the last three hours the show for those that are listening on radio why did I go on
[1:09:38.540 --> 1:09:44.540]  the air and say in the cards I see stage flu pandemic well because I had emergency managers
[1:09:44.540 --> 1:09:51.540]  media people FBI sources federal marshal sources and then of course all this got confirmed
[1:09:51.540 --> 1:09:55.540]  in the next few months saying they're building mass graves they're going to local cemeteries
[1:09:55.540 --> 1:10:01.540]  in New York Indiana Texas Arizona Colorado everywhere getting ready for mass graves

[1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:15.540]  militia gun owners try to attack and steal the flu vaccine when creating that Christmas
[1:10:15.540 --> 1:10:20.540]  toy scenario where everybody's got to have it as and the militias who are actually running
[1:10:20.540 --> 1:10:26.540]  from the flu vaccine because they know what's going on would be killing to get it then that
[1:10:26.540 --> 1:10:30.540]  was the first secret drill then they start fear mongering a few deaths in the US and
[1:10:30.540 --> 1:10:38.540]  Mexico that's the next fake drill in April and I said this is a drill but I said it's
[1:10:38.540 --> 1:10:43.540]  scary because they're saying into the world millions could die billions could die potentially
[1:10:43.540 --> 1:10:49.540]  baxter was tied in live bird flu mixed in with vaccines homeless people dying mainstream
[1:10:49.540 --> 1:10:55.540]  news I said in the fall they're going to launch then the poletano comes out weeks later and

[1:11:18.540 --> 1:11:24.540]  know it's staged we know it's bad and we know it's perfect cover for the imploding
[1:11:24.540 --> 1:11:29.540]  banks taking over the states the states imploding the United States going into global
[1:11:29.540 --> 1:11:34.540]  banking receivership to the new bank of the world that we will pay our carbon taxes to
[1:11:34.540 --> 1:11:39.540]  and we told you this 10 years ago it's now all of the news everything will be OK if you

[1:12:08.540 --> 1:12:13.540]  this out at this time the book eco science to give us one last warning no more denial
[1:12:13.540 --> 1:12:19.540]  it's a compendium of everything we've said in their words admitting word for word what
[1:12:19.540 --> 1:12:24.540]  we reverse engineered and documented they were doing from all the pieces ladies and gentlemen
[1:12:24.540 --> 1:12:29.540]  it is so off the charts what's happening and this is their perfect cover for flu pandemic
[1:12:29.540 --> 1:12:35.540]  flu freaking out flu lockdowns even if it doesn't kill a bunch of people if less than
[1:12:35.540 --> 1:12:40.540]  200 died in the US and less than 2000 worldwide have died and those are puffed numbers themselves
[1:12:40.540 --> 1:12:45.540]  what will happen of tens of thousands died during the regular flu season will the vaccine
[1:12:45.540 --> 1:12:50.540]  spread it as it has in the past will it kill people like the last swine flu vaccine that
[1:12:50.540 --> 1:12:54.540]  broke out on a military base when they gave Americans the shots giving them neurological
[1:12:54.540 --> 1:13:00.540]  and other diseases in 76 that's admitted or will this be the cover for a massive attack
[1:13:00.540 --> 1:13:06.540]  have we already been given the binary first precursor to summing these people mean business
[1:13:06.540 --> 1:13:15.540]  Dr. Sherry 10 penny now joins us but I'm telling you in my gut in my intellect at every level
[1:13:15.540 --> 1:13:21.540]  of my mind and research I have seen this coming since January February because of the drilling
[1:13:21.540 --> 1:13:26.540]  the getting ready the gearing up they're gonna use this as their excuse for martial law they
[1:13:26.540 --> 1:13:31.540]  realize the stage terror isn't working Dr. Sherry 10 penny is a medical doctor from Cleveland
[1:13:31.540 --> 1:13:38.540]  Ohio or board certification emergency medicine and osteopathic manual medicine and her integrative
[1:13:38.540 --> 1:13:44.540]  medical clinic focuses on allergy elimination including treatment of children and asthma

[1:14:09.540 --> 1:14:15.540]  long to go over and the website is doctor 10 penny dot com doc I did that five minute
[1:14:15.540 --> 1:14:22.540]  preface to kind of lay the foundation of what I'm seeing tell us what you're seeing and
[1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:26.540]  where you think this is going you know Alex I listen to that and I've listened to you
[1:14:26.540 --> 1:14:31.540]  before I read your I read present planet and a lot of other documents that I have privy
[1:14:31.540 --> 1:14:36.540]  to just like what you do behind the scenes and I have to be in agreement with you it's
[1:14:36.540 --> 1:14:41.540]  the everything is marching down the path in the same way of just what you just laid out
[1:14:41.540 --> 1:14:46.540]  at the top of the hour my question is and I have a question for you about this is I
[1:14:46.540 --> 1:14:52.540]  mean it seems so focused on the US there is the same type of implementation being happening
[1:14:52.540 --> 1:14:57.540]  in other countries yes yes every NATO country and Western countries you know the master
[1:14:57.540 --> 1:15:04.540]  planners at the UN under UNESCO have written these the whole world even Iran is following
[1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:11.540]  the World Health Organization level six guidelines so even quote enemies are following UN orders
[1:15:11.540 --> 1:15:16.540]  and the UN has bragged this is the first global omnibus health system and they're saying this
[1:15:16.540 --> 1:15:22.540]  is good for globalism good for the new world order and so yes they're doing the same thing
[1:15:22.540 --> 1:15:28.540]  worldwide well you're right that the US seems to be the most intensive it does it seems
[1:15:28.540 --> 1:15:34.540]  as though this is absolutely a plot and plan against the American people and what is happening
[1:15:34.540 --> 1:15:38.540]  is out of Washington under the guise of health which has been happening in the vaccine world
[1:15:38.540 --> 1:15:42.540]  for years is they put up these fancy little pictures with all the smiley little kids and
[1:15:42.540 --> 1:15:46.540]  saying we're going to vaccinate you to keep you healthy and what I'm hoping is from the
[1:15:46.540 --> 1:15:51.540]  things that you're doing and I'm doing and a handful of other of us on radio and television
[1:15:51.540 --> 1:15:55.540]  and internet we're going to get people awake because the only possible way that we have
[1:15:55.540 --> 1:16:01.540]  to revolt and stand up against this is a grassroots awakening of people just saying no I am not
[1:16:01.540 --> 1:16:05.540]  going to do this I'm going to band together with people in my community and I am not going
[1:16:05.540 --> 1:16:11.540]  to I'm not going to take this vaccine and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:15.540]  Absolutely doctor you were in Mexico and all this was happening down there at a conference
[1:16:15.540 --> 1:16:23.540]  I mean let's go over this let's talk about this and discuss what we really know about
[1:16:23.540 --> 1:16:28.540]  the virus it's incredibly weak they're saying it'll mutate into something deadly but I've
[1:16:28.540 --> 1:16:32.540]  talked to other virologists and they've said normally stuff mutates into something less
[1:16:32.540 --> 1:16:38.540]  strong or benign you've got all these big health advisors in Europe and the United States
[1:16:38.540 --> 1:16:43.540]  that are on vaccine maker payroll how are they coming out with a test vaccine in only
[1:16:43.540 --> 1:16:50.540]  months not six months the cloning technology of the of the virus and then openly saying
[1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:54.540]  they're getting ready for forced inoculations telling medical workers they've got to take
[1:16:54.540 --> 1:16:58.540]  it first the army saying they're standing by dr. tim penny you've got the floor break
[1:16:58.540 --> 1:16:59.540]  it down.
[1:16:59.540 --> 1:17:04.540]  Well I agree with everything you've said and the scariest part of all of this is that you
[1:17:04.540 --> 1:17:09.540]  know that as well as all scary I can't say the scariest is that as they are manufacturing
[1:17:09.540 --> 1:17:14.540]  this vaccine they don't have to produce and release a package insert of what's exactly
[1:17:14.540 --> 1:17:18.540]  in the vaccine until it's been approved for use so all the scientific research that they
[1:17:18.540 --> 1:17:24.540]  have there's eleven centers NIH centers around the country that are now holding testing experiment
[1:17:24.540 --> 1:17:29.540]  human experimentation is what I call it and these people who are rolling up their sleeves
[1:17:29.540 --> 1:17:33.540]  and they claim for the sake of science and getting in compensation of that somewhere
[1:17:33.540 --> 1:17:38.540]  between fifty and four hundred dollars to get injected with a vaccine that has an unknown
[1:17:38.540 --> 1:17:43.540]  substance in it there's eleven different sites there are four different studies that are
[1:17:43.540 --> 1:17:48.540]  going on they've started a study in Australia they've started it in the US.
[1:17:48.540 --> 1:17:53.540]  Houston can't that be the cedar I'm sorry to interrupt can't that I mean other vaccine
[1:17:53.540 --> 1:17:58.540]  trials have actually caused pandemics before and they're doing they don't care of
[1:17:58.540 --> 1:18:02.540]  Gardasil's killing girls in mass they don't care of the bird flu test in Europe.
[1:18:02.540 --> 1:18:06.540]  They don't care and what they're going to do is they're going to watch this for three
[1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:12.540]  weeks for side effects so if you were in the experiment today Alex and you got the first
[1:18:12.540 --> 1:18:16.540]  first shot they would follow you for three weeks to see whether or not you developed
[1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:20.540]  any sort of side effects they would draw your blood to see whether or not you developed
[1:18:20.540 --> 1:18:25.540]  an antibody and if it was looking positive like you did you low side effects and you
[1:18:25.540 --> 1:18:31.540]  had an antibody the next round of experimentation is on babies so and they're using two different
[1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:36.540]  dosages of two different vaccines from three different companies so how are they ever going
[1:18:36.540 --> 1:18:42.540]  to pool that data and crunch it I mean real life scientists that have to do real good
[1:18:42.540 --> 1:18:46.540]  research are probably like pulling their hair out right now of thinking how can they possibly
[1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:51.540]  be doing this well it's obviously quackery so they can say we did test it's good to take
[1:18:51.540 --> 1:18:54.540]  just like they said the anthrax shot was good sorry go ahead.
[1:18:54.540 --> 1:18:58.540]  They really are not in a position of wanting to do good side effects that's the bottom
[1:18:58.540 --> 1:19:04.540]  line here because of the of the 2006 pandemic laws that are going into effect the only
[1:19:04.540 --> 1:19:09.540]  way that you can sue and that you have any compensation whatsoever is number one you
[1:19:09.540 --> 1:19:14.540]  have to you have to identify willful intent and you have to get permission from the
[1:19:14.540 --> 1:19:19.540]  secretary of HHS to sue and get compensation if they have very little experimentation going
[1:19:19.540 --> 1:19:25.540]  on very little clinical trials with very short follow-up how could they you could they could
[1:19:25.540 --> 1:19:29.540]  say well gosh we had no idea that it was going to cause this many problems so they could
[1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:34.540]  not be accused of willful intent all right Dr. Sherry Tenpenny I got a million questions
[1:19:34.540 --> 1:19:39.540]  here I'm chomping at the bit they've said other vaccines are safe like anthrax and
[1:19:39.540 --> 1:19:43.540]  smallpox and admittedly had to withdraw them it killed so many people so they're kind of
[1:19:43.540 --> 1:19:48.540]  testing the boundary Gardasil's killing people they won't withdraw it the anthrax killed a
[1:19:48.540 --> 1:19:53.540]  bunch of people they did the smallpox did they withdrew it we know these flu trials
[1:19:53.540 --> 1:19:57.540]  the last year have been killing a lot of people previous to this they're not withdrawing
[1:19:57.540 --> 1:20:02.540]  it now they're setting that precedent if you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes

[1:23:59.540 --> 1:24:24.540]  I don't want to miss the forest for the trees here there have been thousands of cases of different
[1:24:24.540 --> 1:24:33.540]  vaccines killing people in many times causing pandemics and causing thousands to die of
[1:24:33.540 --> 1:24:39.540]  degenerative brain disorders on record like in seventy six with the last swine flu that
[1:24:39.540 --> 1:24:44.540]  popped up at a military base after an inoculation campaign this is a government that's been
[1:24:44.540 --> 1:24:49.540]  caught doing chemical and biological testing thousands of times against the American people
[1:24:49.540 --> 1:24:55.540]  this is a government that gave the Native Americans the smallpox blankets but it's not
[1:24:55.540 --> 1:25:01.540]  even that information it's that this is an unproven different group different companies
[1:25:01.540 --> 1:25:07.540]  different vaccines different trials running around shooting everybody up for something
[1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:13.540]  that killed less than two hundred people in the United States University of Alabama implements
[1:25:13.540 --> 1:25:20.540]  mandatory vaccine program that's been announced I've got New York newspaper headlines this is
[1:25:20.540 --> 1:25:25.540]  out of New York business New York proposes mandatory vaccinations for health care workers
[1:25:25.540 --> 1:25:30.540]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny this is a quick segment but continuing regardless you know they can
[1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:34.540]  say under executive orders they can force us to take shots but then with the media they're
[1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:40.540]  just kind of slowly broaching this to the public yeah I think that what they're trying to do
[1:25:40.540 --> 1:25:47.540]  right now is at least you know Alex is as internet service savvy as you are and I am
[1:25:47.540 --> 1:25:51.540]  and a lot of your listeners are there's still a lot of people that aren't and that they
[1:25:51.540 --> 1:25:57.540]  get their information and their news from Brian Jennings at six o'clock or six thirty
[1:25:57.540 --> 1:26:01.540]  and they really think that that is the truth and they really aren't talking about any of
[1:26:01.540 --> 1:26:06.540]  this on the six o'clock news they're barely talking about it on the talking head shows
[1:26:06.540 --> 1:26:12.540]  so I think that there this is going to come up by surprise to a lot of people and that's
[1:26:12.540 --> 1:26:16.540]  going to make everything they're going to turn the fear crank machine they're going
[1:26:16.540 --> 1:26:20.540]  to have more fear going this fall than what they even had back in March and April when
[1:26:20.540 --> 1:26:25.540]  they were doing the whole Mexican death tally scare thing and then people are going to be
[1:26:25.540 --> 1:26:29.540]  uninformed they're not going to know what to do they're not going to know how to prepare
[1:26:29.540 --> 1:26:32.540]  and they're just going to run down the street and roll up their sleeves so they get the
[1:26:32.540 --> 1:26:38.540]  fact that exactly so we're in a race to reach out to the public and go a couple hundred
[1:26:38.540 --> 1:26:43.540]  people die in Mexico City with compromised immune systems living out in open air shacks
[1:26:43.540 --> 1:26:48.540]  half the population in Mexico City does live like that sick people babies on breathing
[1:26:48.540 --> 1:26:52.540]  machines that were already on the edge of death die in the United States old people
[1:26:52.540 --> 1:26:58.540]  who've had five heart surgeries I mean this is clearly a hoax what is your gut as a
[1:26:58.540 --> 1:27:02.540]  surgeon as a medical doctor tell you is this just high to sell vaccines and have a federal
[1:27:02.540 --> 1:27:07.540]  clamp down and get issues to take a new in orders or is it worse I mean if they almost
[1:27:07.540 --> 1:27:12.540]  had a complete lockdown of the world over a couple hundred deaths what's going to happen
[1:27:12.540 --> 1:27:17.540]  when the public gets confused by regular flu deaths in the thousands that's a great
[1:27:17.540 --> 1:27:21.540]  question and I don't know that I have any answer to that and I think that one of the
[1:27:21.540 --> 1:27:25.540]  questions that I've been asked hundreds of times in the last couple of weeks for all
[1:27:25.540 --> 1:27:30.540]  of the the internet and radio and webinar work that I've been doing is what do we do
[1:27:30.540 --> 1:27:35.540]  I mean what can we do it's one thing to get all this information it's another thing to
[1:27:35.540 --> 1:27:41.540]  give people something to do so we set up a web website it's pandemic flu online
[1:27:41.540 --> 1:27:47.540]  dot com pandemic flu online dot com and we've given people tools downloadable PDF
[1:27:47.540 --> 1:27:52.540]  files that are flyers and and brochures and articles that they can give to the their
[1:27:52.540 --> 1:27:57.540]  led editors of the letter letter to the editors we're setting up on PowerPoint
[1:27:57.540 --> 1:28:01.540]  many PowerPoint presentations of things that they can take to their local community
[1:28:01.540 --> 1:28:05.540]  and get them informed about the truth about the flu shot that it doesn't work in babies
[1:28:05.540 --> 1:28:10.540]  people with asthma and adults or the elderly it doesn't work in anybody and to let them
[1:28:10.540 --> 1:28:15.540]  know that there's all the stuff that's inside the vaccines and to give them information
[1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:19.540]  and phone numbers and telling them to call their senators and representatives and let
[1:28:19.540 --> 1:28:24.540]  them know that we don't want this this is not about saying let us home shield if you're
[1:28:24.540 --> 1:28:29.540]  gonna have the army lock everything down don't make us go to some inoculation center
[1:28:29.540 --> 1:28:33.540]  exactly don't take all of those things all that stuff that all those things are building
[1:28:33.540 --> 1:28:38.540]  on a daily basis on that website so because you know Alex I've been saying for years
[1:28:38.540 --> 1:28:42.540]  we've got to get people active we've got it we've got to get people aware but we haven't
[1:28:42.540 --> 1:28:47.540]  given them the tools to do that and so we're creating tools now so that people can pass
[1:28:47.540 --> 1:28:53.540]  these out and we're having a tremendous response where I am here in Cleveland Ohio that passing
[1:28:53.540 --> 1:28:58.540]  out these brochures and passing out the flyers to people that had no idea and people who
[1:28:58.540 --> 1:29:02.540]  said you know I've been looking for something like this to pass out to somebody thank you
[1:29:02.540 --> 1:29:06.540]  for making this so the more people that we get aware and the more people that know what's
[1:29:06.540 --> 1:29:11.540]  going on the less that fear mongering and that fear crank is going to be on the 6 o'clock
[1:29:11.540 --> 1:29:16.540]  news and we've got now we've given people something to do rather than just making them
[1:29:16.540 --> 1:29:21.540]  afraid and there really is the school still out on the mandatory vaccination I mean we
[1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:25.540]  don't really know what's going to happen with that but the only thing we can do right now
[1:29:25.540 --> 1:29:30.540]  is to get people aware that's right because the precedent is set at schools there's no
[1:29:30.540 --> 1:29:35.540]  law to take all these different shots they lie and say oh you got to take it it's the
[1:29:35.540 --> 1:29:42.540]  law and then they kick you out for truancy when you violate the policy it's a policy
[1:29:42.540 --> 1:29:47.540]  like we have a policy against chewing gum so they're going to try to hit our kids first
[1:29:47.540 --> 1:29:55.540]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[1:29:55.540 --> 1:30:03.540]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones have you heard of the millionaire patriot well

[1:32:08.540 --> 1:32:12.540]  taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone
[1:32:12.540 --> 1:32:16.540]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day there is no job

[1:32:20.540 --> 1:32:24.540]  of your livelihood and own your own business since you are the boss

[1:33:21.540 --> 1:33:25.540]  Ladies and gentlemen we have tracked the history of the globalists they funded
[1:33:25.540 --> 1:33:31.540]  Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Pol Pot they fund everybody they are eugenicists
[1:33:31.540 --> 1:33:35.540]  they are in power because they are the most ruthless the most wicked the most
[1:33:35.540 --> 1:33:40.540]  cunning and good people could beat them if we would just admit evil existed
[1:33:40.540 --> 1:33:45.540]  if we would just admit the psychopaths are operating and I want the illusions
[1:33:45.540 --> 1:33:49.540]  shattered for police and military and the general public people that serve the
[1:33:49.540 --> 1:33:53.540]  system that think the system's good that they go well I'm a good person so the
[1:33:53.540 --> 1:34:00.540]  system must be good no no the system is directed from the top by primeval by
[1:34:00.540 --> 1:34:08.540]  total fundamental foundational greed avarice and control freak I mean that
[1:34:08.540 --> 1:34:12.540]  is the spirit of this selfishness this this wickedness and they write textbooks
[1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:17.540]  bragging they've been caught thousands of times doing unbelievably horrible
[1:34:17.540 --> 1:34:21.540]  things to us and they say they're doing it the British government the
[1:34:21.540 --> 1:34:24.540]  Australian government the German government the communist under the
[1:34:24.540 --> 1:34:27.540]  Russians the Russians aren't doing it now the Russians admit that the
[1:34:27.540 --> 1:34:30.540]  government was sterilizing people and poisoning the water and they
[1:34:30.540 --> 1:34:34.540]  apologize and pay their people to have children now and don't have CPS running
[1:34:34.540 --> 1:34:38.540]  around grabbing kids I'm not saying Russia's perfect it's it's got a lot of
[1:34:38.540 --> 1:34:45.540]  mafia and corruption but it certainly is different just from the proof is in
[1:34:45.540 --> 1:34:50.540]  the pudding and this is real ladies and gentlemen and we're all in the boat
[1:34:50.540 --> 1:34:56.540]  together I'm hoping this is just a beta test for future pandemics as I've said
[1:34:56.540 --> 1:34:59.540]  they're gonna have more stage releases training us how to be locked down
[1:34:59.540 --> 1:35:02.540]  training us how to be controlled because everything's incrementalism with
[1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:07.540]  these people they're going back to dr. sherry tim penny doctor you know I'm
[1:35:07.540 --> 1:35:10.540]  ranting here it's just I think about how the smallpox shots killed so many
[1:35:10.540 --> 1:35:13.540]  people and they had to stop them I think about how the anthrax shots two
[1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:17.540]  separate times they forced the troops to take them and killed people in mass on
[1:35:17.540 --> 1:35:22.540]  record and then nobody gets in trouble I think about how Baxter gets caught
[1:35:22.540 --> 1:35:26.540]  doing all this stuff I think about the homeless people trials lying to them and
[1:35:26.540 --> 1:35:30.540]  the homeless dying in mass I mean one group of homeless that were shot up what
[1:35:30.540 --> 1:35:36.540]  23 died in one clinic in Poland and then they set the precedent now where we
[1:35:36.540 --> 1:35:42.540]  take the shots and we die or we all these people call that gave their daughters
[1:35:42.540 --> 1:35:47.540]  shots for Gardasil they have autoimmune disorders down or in wheelchairs I mean
[1:35:47.540 --> 1:35:53.540]  this is really happening doctor yes yes it is and what's really scary to me is
[1:35:53.540 --> 1:35:57.540]  what is the adjuvant that they're going to be putting into the shot there's no
[1:35:57.540 --> 1:36:03.540]  doubt in my mind that the adjuvant are going to be added and just to you know
[1:36:03.540 --> 1:36:06.540]  make sure everybody knows what an adjuvant is and we've got virus which is
[1:36:06.540 --> 1:36:10.540]  called antigen and then we have a chemical that gets put in it to make the
[1:36:10.540 --> 1:36:14.540]  further so if you've got a quart of antigen but what you really need is 10
[1:36:14.540 --> 1:36:18.540]  gallons of antigen you put these additional adjuvants in there so you
[1:36:18.540 --> 1:36:23.540]  can use less of the virus per shot the fact that we've spent hundreds of
[1:36:23.540 --> 1:36:27.540]  millions of dollars buying adjuvant from Glasgow Smith's client and from
[1:36:27.540 --> 1:36:31.540]  Novartis we've already purchased it we know that they're going to use it the
[1:36:31.540 --> 1:36:36.540]  second the part about that that's really really bad is that neither one of those
[1:36:36.540 --> 1:36:42.540]  ASO3 from GSK and MS59 from Novartis are FDA approved for flu shots in this
[1:36:42.540 --> 1:36:47.540]  country but they're going to use it and they're going to use it by two
[1:36:47.540 --> 1:36:50.540]  means when they're going to say we're not going to have enough virus vaccine
[1:36:50.540 --> 1:36:53.540]  ready by the time we want to start this flu shot so we're going to start
[1:36:53.540 --> 1:36:57.540]  putting the adjuvant in we're going to declare that it's okay for use under
[1:36:57.540 --> 1:37:01.540]  the federal powers act the FDA can make that happen and fast track it so we'll
[1:37:01.540 --> 1:37:04.540]  put it in the vaccine and then give them total liability protection that's
[1:37:04.540 --> 1:37:07.540]  already been done and for those that don't know you're a medical doctor but
[1:37:07.540 --> 1:37:11.540]  I've had other medical doctors on neurologist all these experts I've even
[1:37:11.540 --> 1:37:18.540]  had brain surgeons on neurologist and on record they've known for 50 plus years
[1:37:18.540 --> 1:37:23.540]  that the different accelerants the different things that these adjuvants
[1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:27.540]  that activate the immune system that that's what is causing the brain swelling
[1:37:27.540 --> 1:37:33.540]  the burning out of the pancreas the swelling in organs the autoimmune diseases
[1:37:33.540 --> 1:37:38.540]  they know and you're saying this is going to be supercharged with that yeah
[1:37:38.540 --> 1:37:41.540]  it's going to be supercharged with because these adjuvants would have
[1:37:41.540 --> 1:37:45.540]  squalene in them and the squalene in experiment of animals has caused have
[1:37:45.540 --> 1:37:49.540]  caused horrible side effects including debilitating arthritis the recent
[1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:52.540]  report that came out a couple of days ago said that they really have in
[1:37:52.540 --> 1:37:56.540]  trouble with this H1N1 virus that they have because it's not replicating as
[1:37:56.540 --> 1:38:01.540]  fast as they would like it to and that the yields are only about 20% of what
[1:38:01.540 --> 1:38:06.540]  the normal yield would be for a virus that they're trying to create so it's
[1:38:06.540 --> 1:38:09.540]  not growing very fast they can't make very much of it they only purchased a
[1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:13.540]  certain amount of it so it's all leading to the conclusion hey government hey
[1:38:13.540 --> 1:38:18.540]  CDC we need to put the MS-59 and the ASO3 in there to spread it around so we've
[1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:23.540]  got enough for everybody well doctor I've also read studies neither one of them
[1:38:23.540 --> 1:38:27.540]  have been tested in children neither one of the tests in children I've also read
[1:38:27.540 --> 1:38:33.540]  that a lot of these chemicals they add to elicit the autoimmune response have
[1:38:33.540 --> 1:38:38.540]  been associated with later reproductive problems and so of course they like
[1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:42.540]  that because it ends up reducing fertility well and even the normal
[1:38:42.540 --> 1:38:46.540]  regular annual flu shots by which they're saying that kids who are going to
[1:38:46.540 --> 1:38:49.540]  school this fall and if they not had a previous flu shot are supposed to get
[1:38:49.540 --> 1:38:54.540]  four flu shots before they go oh my god I forgot to ask you that let me I'm
[1:38:54.540 --> 1:38:57.540]  going to try to shut up here but please go through this because you keep
[1:38:57.540 --> 1:39:00.540]  there's thousands of points here I have a family you have a family it's
[1:39:00.540 --> 1:39:04.540]  freaking me out as this freight train comes towards us and somehow we've
[1:39:04.540 --> 1:39:09.540]  got to get the public to wake up and say no that's the big issue here is that
[1:39:09.540 --> 1:39:14.540]  they're saying like a placebo go get old flu shots that they admit have no
[1:39:14.540 --> 1:39:19.540]  connection to this flu give you no immunity and people are already lined up
[1:39:19.540 --> 1:39:24.540]  clinics and panicking for three four months straight getting all these
[1:39:24.540 --> 1:39:29.540]  ridiculous shots and Obama said doctor Obama says you need to take three
[1:39:29.540 --> 1:39:33.540]  shots now they're saying four shots I mean soon will it be your morning
[1:39:33.540 --> 1:39:37.540]  flu shot break that down doctor well they're saying that in order that the
[1:39:37.540 --> 1:39:41.540]  theory is that in order to develop an adequate immune response you're
[1:39:41.540 --> 1:39:46.540]  supposed to get a and a vaccine followed up by a second vaccine so if you
[1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:50.540]  have children who are eight or nine or ten years old who have not previously
[1:39:50.540 --> 1:39:54.540]  had a flu shot of any kind the recommendations that are coming out
[1:39:54.540 --> 1:39:58.540]  is that they'll get the regular flu shot three weeks later they'll get their
[1:39:58.540 --> 1:40:02.540]  booster on their regular annual flu shot three weeks later they'll get their
[1:40:02.540 --> 1:40:06.540]  swine flu shot and three weeks after that they'll get their booster of their
[1:40:06.540 --> 1:40:10.540]  swine flu shot and then we'll see how many kids can actually function in
[1:40:10.540 --> 1:40:14.540]  school this year as if it isn't already bad enough and they're recommending that
[1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:20.540]  for kids six months of age and older so you know the adults are supposed to get
[1:40:20.540 --> 1:40:23.540]  three flu shots are supposed to get their annual seasonal flu shot a swine
[1:40:23.540 --> 1:40:27.540]  flu and a swine flu booster but your kids if they haven't had a previous one
[1:40:27.540 --> 1:40:31.540]  they're supposed to get four I just think it you know it's like it's almost
[1:40:31.540 --> 1:40:35.540]  like there's people there's this concept that all that's in there is a little
[1:40:35.540 --> 1:40:38.540]  dead virus and a little sterile water and so what good what harm is it going to
[1:40:38.540 --> 1:40:43.540]  cause and a little is good so a whole lot must be better and what we're doing
[1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:47.540]  is causing a massive amount of problems and in children and adults and
[1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:52.540]  everybody needs to just get informed about this go to pandemic fluonline.com
[1:40:52.540 --> 1:40:56.540]  go to drtenpenney.com download the information and pass it out to your
[1:40:56.540 --> 1:41:00.540]  family and friends take it to your school let the teachers know it let the people
[1:41:00.540 --> 1:41:04.540]  in the in your daycare know it let the put the principles on notice that you're
[1:41:04.540 --> 1:41:08.540]  not going to have that happening to your children in your school system it's the
[1:41:08.540 --> 1:41:11.540]  only way that we're going to be able to stop this from all these vaccines
[1:41:11.540 --> 1:41:18.540]  happening at schools this year and doc that's my next two points is a we had
[1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:25.540]  big victories in 2000 2003 2002 2003 when they tried to order the 14 million
[1:41:25.540 --> 1:41:30.540]  first responders to take the smallpox shot and said it's the law everyone
[1:41:30.540 --> 1:41:35.540]  will do it or you'll be fired firemen police medical workers nurses doctors
[1:41:35.540 --> 1:41:40.540]  city workers county workers state workers the majority of them said no
[1:41:40.540 --> 1:41:47.540]  so that program stalled and died we've had victories before over this but they've
[1:41:47.540 --> 1:41:52.540]  been so successful fear mongering with the pre flu hype they didn't have that
[1:41:52.540 --> 1:41:58.540]  with the smallpox they just use 9-11 saying we just got hit a year ago we're
[1:41:58.540 --> 1:42:03.540]  sure al-qaeda is going to use smallpox people didn't buy that but people have
[1:42:03.540 --> 1:42:06.540]  had the flu and know it really feels bad and know it that it can kill you
[1:42:06.540 --> 1:42:11.540]  sometimes so that's why this is so much more effective that's why this fight is
[1:42:11.540 --> 1:42:16.540]  so important so speak to our only recourse I guess is to educate is to
[1:42:16.540 --> 1:42:20.540]  warn people is to spread the word like our lives depend on it with the articles
[1:42:20.540 --> 1:42:24.540]  and info wars dot com prison planet dot com global research has done a huge
[1:42:24.540 --> 1:42:29.540]  compendium article that's incredibly good we've got linked up on info wars dot
[1:42:29.540 --> 1:42:36.540]  com so a educate everybody we've got a fighting chance be I have the
[1:42:36.540 --> 1:42:40.540]  washington post buried an article poll watch is doing a story on it saying oh
[1:42:40.540 --> 1:42:45.540]  yeah these flu shots have high levels of mercury they've lied in the past and
[1:42:45.540 --> 1:42:49.540]  said they've taken the mercury out another lie so speak to getting the word
[1:42:49.540 --> 1:42:54.540]  out and waking people up and then the mercury angle well getting the word out
[1:42:54.540 --> 1:42:59.540]  is what I keep telling everybody they have to do and everybody says why I
[1:42:59.540 --> 1:43:04.540]  don't know who I should talk to talk to everybody I have a stack of flyers that
[1:43:04.540 --> 1:43:08.540]  I carry around with me and my person in the back of my car because I take them
[1:43:08.540 --> 1:43:12.540]  into everywhere I say here that and I've gone down the street I where my office
[1:43:12.540 --> 1:43:16.540]  is and I've stopped with with me with these fires it's the truth about the flu
[1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:20.540]  shot you can get it off of my website and it's all over the internet and I
[1:43:20.540 --> 1:43:24.540]  don't even engage it with them in conversation I just walk in and say
[1:43:24.540 --> 1:43:27.540]  good morning good afternoon how are you here's some information I think you
[1:43:27.540 --> 1:43:31.540]  might be an interest in looking at and turn around and walk out you don't have
[1:43:31.540 --> 1:43:35.540]  to be in their debate anybody just and the worst that's going to happen is
[1:43:35.540 --> 1:43:39.540]  nothing they throw it in the trash but you never know whose hands that might
[1:43:39.540 --> 1:43:42.540]  end up in that might really make a difference your police department your
[1:43:42.540 --> 1:43:46.540]  first responders your sheriff all these people need to know that you don't want
[1:43:46.540 --> 1:43:49.540]  this and that they may not even know what's going to be injected into their
[1:43:49.540 --> 1:43:53.540]  body and once they know it they might say well you know what I don't want to see
[1:43:53.540 --> 1:43:58.540]  there and suddenly you've got an entire community that's going to to rally around
[1:43:58.540 --> 1:44:02.540]  so when the FEMA trucks come driving down your street and to look for people
[1:44:02.540 --> 1:44:06.540]  who haven't been vaccinated you've got a community that's going to bond together
[1:44:06.540 --> 1:44:10.540]  and and resist well said I want you to get into the mercury but before we do
[1:44:10.540 --> 1:44:15.540]  that expanding on what you're saying printing up a nice flyer using your
[1:44:15.540 --> 1:44:19.540]  flyer printing up prison planet articles global research articles whatever
[1:44:19.540 --> 1:44:24.540]  there's a lot of good boil downs out there our story about FEMA you know the
[1:44:24.540 --> 1:44:29.540]  flu FEMA martial law mass graves that has a nice boil down effects people are
[1:44:29.540 --> 1:44:33.540]  really interested in the flu right now they instinctively know something's
[1:44:33.540 --> 1:44:40.540]  wrong something doesn't add up they are begging for this information go to
[1:44:40.540 --> 1:44:45.540]  kinkos or Fed Exos or whatever it's called now and and for a hundred bucks
[1:44:45.540 --> 1:44:51.540]  you could print up five thousand one or two sheets for twenty bucks you can print
[1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:58.540]  up you know thousands get it out to people and that's a child a woman a man
[1:44:58.540 --> 1:45:04.540]  that isn't going to be getting that you know onset of Parkinson's at twenty five
[1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:12.540]  that onset of these brain disorders people getting Alzheimer's at forty now
[1:45:12.540 --> 1:45:16.540]  all tied to the vaccines go ahead and dementia and all because that's really
[1:45:16.540 --> 1:45:20.540]  what's happening we light up the immune systems in the brain and it causes them
[1:45:20.540 --> 1:45:24.540]  to deteriorate and that's why we're seeing so many young people now with
[1:45:24.540 --> 1:45:29.540]  ADD ADHD know all the adults with ADHD all the things that we can label them
[1:45:29.540 --> 1:45:34.540]  with so that we can give them more psychotropic drugs like effects are
[1:45:34.540 --> 1:45:37.540]  impactful and all of these things I think that you know I've said for years
[1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:41.540]  Alex that I think that the vaccine industry is really the economic loss
[1:45:41.540 --> 1:45:46.540]  leader of the entire pharmaceutical industry it's you know the idea that
[1:45:46.540 --> 1:45:50.540]  of a loss leader issue you know come into my store I'll give you a free T-shirt
[1:45:50.540 --> 1:45:54.540]  and oh by the way while you're here spend a couple hundred dollars so the
[1:45:54.540 --> 1:45:58.540]  economic loss leader of being vaccines is I'll give you this shot doesn't really
[1:45:58.540 --> 1:46:02.540]  a whole lot of money even though it is a ten billion dollar your industry but I
[1:46:02.540 --> 1:46:06.540]  that's a pit that's compared to other things I'll give you the shot under the
[1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:09.540]  umbrella of keeping you healthy we got to keep these kids from getting sick and
[1:46:09.540 --> 1:46:13.540]  oh by the way I'll make hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars
[1:46:13.540 --> 1:46:16.540]  and all the drugs I need to sell you down the line after you're sick from
[1:46:16.540 --> 1:46:19.540]  from what we've given you through these shots well that's what I was going to say
[1:46:19.540 --> 1:46:24.540]  they make them approve other drugs even if they approve something bad down the
[1:46:24.540 --> 1:46:29.540]  truth comes out vaccines are not held to the same standard they can kill whoever
[1:46:29.540 --> 1:46:35.540]  they want hurt whoever they want because it's proprietary and very secretive
[1:46:35.540 --> 1:46:41.540]  what's really in it it's the perfect cover for the soft kill it's the perfect
[1:46:41.540 --> 1:46:46.540]  cover for the sterilization the UN has been caught as you know adding the
[1:46:46.540 --> 1:46:50.540]  female hormone to the tetanus shot that then sterilize the women only in a
[1:46:50.540 --> 1:46:55.540]  program for women it was pushed as feminism over only helping women and
[1:46:55.540 --> 1:46:59.540]  because that weapon wouldn't have hurt a man it was designed for a woman I mean
[1:46:59.540 --> 1:47:04.540]  this is diabolical and the way they want to set the precedent to put in our body
[1:47:04.540 --> 1:47:09.540]  what they want when they want you know about all these new live viral vaccines
[1:47:09.540 --> 1:47:14.540]  that are really live action genetic engineer operations I've had top genetic
[1:47:14.540 --> 1:47:22.540]  engineers on with the quote vaccine that cures you from cocaine or nicotine or
[1:47:22.540 --> 1:47:27.540]  heroin addiction and it's a live virus that goes in and attacks the receptors
[1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:32.540]  in the brain creating plaques so you can't absorb the drug which also then
[1:47:32.540 --> 1:47:37.540]  blocks your endorphins but don't worry they've got a drug to then treat that
[1:47:37.540 --> 1:47:44.540]  can you speak to those classes of things called vaccines that are really nanobot
[1:47:44.540 --> 1:47:50.540]  you know genetically engineered viral weapons yeah they are that's really
[1:47:50.540 --> 1:47:56.540]  you summed it up really well Alex and they are DNA vaccines that are coming down
[1:47:56.540 --> 1:48:00.540]  the pike and now they're talking about edible vaccines that there's vaccines
[1:48:00.540 --> 1:48:04.540]  that are going to be in potatoes and carrots there's a vaccine that they have
[1:48:04.540 --> 1:48:08.540]  that are doing in Africa that is spread by mosquitoes I mean it gets
[1:48:08.540 --> 1:48:13.540]  that's Bill Gates it gets more like a great bee sci-fi movie all the time
[1:48:13.540 --> 1:48:17.540]  and it would be really kind of funny if it wasn't so diabolical
[1:48:17.540 --> 1:48:21.540]  well that's Bill Gates the eugenicist who now they've totally given over a
[1:48:21.540 --> 1:48:24.540]  hundred billion I'm saying eighty something billion it's gone up
[1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:27.540]  him and Warren Buffett they're all supporting Planned Parenthood
[1:48:27.540 --> 1:48:31.540]  Bill Gates's daddy runs Planned Parenthood they're openly and he's like
[1:48:31.540 --> 1:48:37.540]  I want to release mosquitoes to give you an HIV cure and I mean my god doctor
[1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:42.540]  this is pretty obvious what's going on you would think that by now Alex
[1:48:42.540 --> 1:48:47.540]  from everything that people have been saying that there would be nobody left
[1:48:47.540 --> 1:48:51.540]  who would believe that vaccines are safe they protect you they're harmless
[1:48:51.540 --> 1:48:56.540]  and they're good for you but we've got multi-generational two hundred years
[1:48:56.540 --> 1:49:01.540]  multi-generational indoctrination that people really believe that vaccines are
[1:49:01.540 --> 1:49:05.540]  good they really will keep me from getting sick and you know the FDA and
[1:49:05.540 --> 1:49:09.540]  the government wouldn't ever approve anything that might harm me and so the
[1:49:09.540 --> 1:49:14.540]  undoing that in people's psyche is taking a long long time but I think that
[1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:18.540]  pretty soon we're going to reach the hundredth monkey here I really do and I
[1:49:18.540 --> 1:49:21.540]  think that there's going to be a hundredth monkey phenomenon when all of a
[1:49:21.540 --> 1:49:25.540]  sudden everybody's going to go holy cow and they're all going to wake up at
[1:49:25.540 --> 1:49:29.540]  the end honestly Alex I think that's what the government's most fearful of
[1:49:29.540 --> 1:49:33.540]  because of radio because of the internet because of webinars because of all of
[1:49:33.540 --> 1:49:37.540]  these technologies that we have we have an exponential waking up curve that's
[1:49:37.540 --> 1:49:41.540]  happening unlike anything that you and I have seen in the last five to seven years
[1:49:41.540 --> 1:49:45.540]  it's happening really fast and so there's this race to the finish line of like
[1:49:45.540 --> 1:49:49.540]  holy cow we can't control all those people we can't keep them in the dark if
[1:49:49.540 --> 1:49:53.540]  suddenly they're all awake we have to suddenly ramp up the
[1:49:53.540 --> 1:49:57.540]  200 the 400 year pathway that they've had in terms of taking over the world and
[1:49:57.540 --> 1:50:01.540]  we have to do it really quick because if we don't do it soon there's going to be
[1:50:01.540 --> 1:50:04.540]  so many people awake that are going to revolt that we're not going to be able to be
[1:50:04.540 --> 1:50:08.540]  successful which is what I'm hoping will happen they won't be successful
[1:50:08.540 --> 1:50:12.540]  Dr. Sherrie Tinpenny you just headed out of the park right there you just said it
[1:50:12.540 --> 1:50:17.540]  all they are behind schedule people are waking up they clearly have accelerated
[1:50:17.540 --> 1:50:22.540]  every program the gun grabbing the carbon tax the banking takeover the open
[1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:29.540]  borders the wars yeah I mean they are in a panic in a bit of a panic
[1:50:29.540 --> 1:50:34.540]  well my dad did exterminating in college some raised money and he'd go into the
[1:50:34.540 --> 1:50:38.540]  bad part of town to kill roaches and he said it's true when you spray roaches
[1:50:38.540 --> 1:50:43.540]  with poison they start fornicating and that's kind of what the elites are doing
[1:50:43.540 --> 1:50:48.540]  they realize that they're losing and so they're just going wild they are really
[1:50:48.540 --> 1:50:53.540]  trying to take over right now final segment with our guest

[3:08:23.260 --> 3:08:29.380]  Anthrax War, the untold story of 2001, Anthrax attacks in the dark secrets of the hidden
[3:08:29.380 --> 3:08:34.660]  world of modern-day germ warfare research. We have two amazing investigative journalists
[3:08:34.660 --> 3:08:40.580]  for this, who made this film. I tried to read their whole bios, we've run out of time, but
[3:08:40.580 --> 3:08:44.820]  Bob Cohn is a filmmaker journalist and war correspondent whose work is always focused
[3:08:44.820 --> 3:08:49.220]  on uncovering hidden truths. He was based in Africa for 15 years. I'd like to get him
[3:08:49.220 --> 3:08:53.380]  on and just talk about those adventures and perspective. And was a correspondent for CNN
[3:08:53.380 --> 3:09:02.260]  International, and he has received major prizes for best television, war correspondent, reporting
[3:09:02.260 --> 3:09:08.100]  from Liberia. He was also made award-winning films, which include Mozambique, Struggle
[3:09:08.100 --> 3:09:12.940]  for Survival, Angola, Triumph of Tragedy, and Blood in Memory has been broadcast on
[3:09:12.940 --> 3:09:18.180]  CNN International, National Geographic PBS and Channel 4 UK, among others. He is also
[3:09:18.180 --> 3:09:23.460]  a consultant for the United Nations and Conflict Zones of Humanitarian Emergencies. Eric Nadler
[3:09:23.460 --> 3:09:27.180]  is an author, TV producer, and filmmaker. He has written for Rolling Stone, Mother
[3:09:27.180 --> 3:09:33.540]  Jones, Harper's New Republic, and has had his films been featured in PBS, Sundance Channel,
[3:09:33.540 --> 3:09:38.740]  Port TV, United States, and Broadcast internationally. He's produced several PBS front-line programs
[3:09:38.740 --> 3:09:44.820]  including BCCI, Bank of Crooks, and Criminals. Gotta get him on about that, Clark Clifford.
[3:09:44.820 --> 3:09:51.500]  And the secret arming of Saudi Arabia, his theatrical film, and it just goes on and on.
[3:09:51.500 --> 3:09:56.900]  I gotta have you guys on repeatedly, obvious, because, I mean, I saw your film, liked it,
[3:09:56.900 --> 3:10:00.340]  and then, you know, read the work you've done, but this is really exciting. All right, I'm
[3:10:00.340 --> 3:10:05.740]  gonna shut up. Let's get in to how you made the film, why you made it, and what it covers.
[3:10:05.740 --> 3:10:07.340]  This is quite a story.
[3:10:07.340 --> 3:10:13.420]  Well, you know, the film began with those anthrax attacks, Alex, and we all remember
[3:10:13.420 --> 3:10:20.660]  how, you know, just weeks after 9-11, these anthrax letters happened and they caused panic
[3:10:20.660 --> 3:10:25.980]  all across the country, all across the world. And, you know, it was in the headlines, people
[3:10:25.980 --> 3:10:31.980]  were buying Cipro, and then after about two months or so, it started fading. The FBI started
[3:10:31.980 --> 3:10:38.700]  focusing on one culprit, and nothing seemed to be happening with the FBI investigation.
[3:10:38.700 --> 3:10:43.860]  And we were convinced that to really understand the anthrax attacks, we had to take a look
[3:10:43.860 --> 3:10:49.700]  at this world of germ war research here in the United States and internationally. And
[3:10:49.700 --> 3:10:55.460]  that's what we did with this film. We started looking into this secret world of germ weapons
[3:10:55.460 --> 3:10:59.300]  to try and understand the anthrax attacks.
[3:10:59.300 --> 3:11:08.380]  Again, that voice or that person you see at PrisonPlanet.tv is Bob Cohn. Eric, I mean,
[3:11:08.380 --> 3:11:13.540]  obviously, you already knew Mr. Cohn, you got into this the same way, or how did you
[3:11:13.540 --> 3:11:18.500]  guys approach this? I mean, obviously, you learned more as you investigated, or were
[3:11:18.500 --> 3:11:22.220]  you aware of this when you got into it, the darker ramifications?
[3:11:22.220 --> 3:11:27.580]  Well, Bob and I had a personal relationship for many years. In terms of years ago, there
[3:11:27.580 --> 3:11:33.860]  was a PBS program called South African Now. In the final days of the apartheid regime,
[3:11:33.860 --> 3:11:41.580]  a few network producers got together and were very concerned how that censorship restrictions
[3:11:41.580 --> 3:11:48.220]  were being put on American networks, and thus the actual coverage of the South African situation
[3:11:48.220 --> 3:11:59.780]  as the white regime collapsed really fed less and less and less into the network news budget.
[3:11:59.780 --> 3:12:05.100]  And there were some people who got together and said to PBS, can we get together and keep
[3:12:05.100 --> 3:12:09.740]  this South Africa issue on the front lines? And that's where I met Bob. Bob was a great
[3:12:09.740 --> 3:12:16.500]  correspondent for CNN, and I was a freelance journalist here in the United States. When
[3:12:16.500 --> 3:12:24.180]  it came time for the anthrax attacks, it struck me in a very deep position. I had never seen
[3:12:24.180 --> 3:12:32.620]  a more serious story disappear so quickly from the mainstream news media without much
[3:12:32.620 --> 3:12:38.380]  questioning. In other words, everyone talked about 9-11. Yes, that was the most serious
[3:12:38.380 --> 3:12:45.300]  story you could ever do. And there were anniversaries about 9-11 and beautiful documentaries with
[3:12:45.300 --> 3:12:51.020]  shining lights into the sky. When we came to the anthrax attacks, there was silence.
[3:12:51.020 --> 3:12:59.180]  And the anthrax attacks, as we say in our film, anthrax war, was a one-two punch against
[3:12:59.180 --> 3:13:08.340]  the republic. 9-11 was the left jab, and the anthrax attacks was the right cross. And people
[3:13:08.340 --> 3:13:16.540]  didn't remember that really knockout punch. Look, my wife works in Rockefeller Center
[3:13:16.540 --> 3:13:22.620]  in New York, and she remembered the planes flying. She heard them, the planes flying
[3:13:22.620 --> 3:13:28.860]  toward the World Trade Center that terrible morning. She heard that, and she's a tough
[3:13:28.860 --> 3:13:35.700]  gal. But where she really lost it was when they opened up anthrax envelopes in the media
[3:13:35.700 --> 3:13:40.620]  center next door to her. And she screamed to me over the phone. The first time I heard
[3:13:40.620 --> 3:13:46.860]  this tough feminist lawyer woman scream to me, Eric, we've got to buy a Cipro. And I
[3:13:46.860 --> 3:13:55.220]  knew some line had been crossed that's an terrorism had been done fundamentally upon
[3:13:55.220 --> 3:14:03.220]  educated media government people. And I said to myself, yikes, the anthrax attacks, that's
[3:14:03.220 --> 3:14:09.180]  the most important piece of business. And if you remember, it went silent for many years.
[3:14:09.180 --> 3:14:14.460]  And then Bob had worked with years earlier, had come to me after we had not been with
[3:14:14.460 --> 3:14:20.260]  each other for a while. He was in Africa, I was in New York. He came to me and said,
[3:14:20.260 --> 3:14:25.140]  Eric, what's up with these anthrax attacks? And I said, you know, Bob, I think this is
[3:14:25.140 --> 3:14:31.340]  the most serious thing that we as investigative journalists can take a look at. And I know
[3:14:31.340 --> 3:14:37.860]  you at CNN have tried and me at a million other mainstream outlets had tried. Let's
[3:14:37.860 --> 3:14:45.100]  be independent. Let's see what's really going on here. And that became the genesis of our
[3:14:45.100 --> 3:14:47.780]  investigation.
[3:14:47.780 --> 3:14:52.740]  Now again, you guys are joining us not just on the radio, but live in living color from
[3:14:52.740 --> 3:14:58.940]  New York at prisonplanet.tv. The film is anthrax war. The website is anthraxwar.com. Again,
[3:14:58.940 --> 3:15:06.260]  you can also get the film there or at infowars.com. Now this film needs to be seen. Gentlemen,
[3:15:06.260 --> 3:15:12.460]  let's start getting into the evidence of this being a cover up, but just briefly mentioning
[3:15:12.460 --> 3:15:16.500]  what happened at that time. I was obviously glued to television and radio covering the
[3:15:16.500 --> 3:15:22.340]  9-11 attacks myself. And 9-11 kind of built its peak of hysteria. And then suddenly the
[3:15:22.340 --> 3:15:28.500]  anthrax and for a week or two, it was as big as the 9-11 attacks. And they were taking
[3:15:28.500 --> 3:15:34.700]  over the capital and the federal government. The executive was ordering the capital evacuated,
[3:15:34.700 --> 3:15:38.900]  which was a violation of the separation of powers. And democratic enemies were getting
[3:15:38.900 --> 3:15:45.020]  sent anthrax and people that had taken photos of the Bush daughters in Austin falling down
[3:15:45.020 --> 3:15:49.460]  on each other drunk in a provocative pose were getting the letters. And it was clearly meant
[3:15:49.460 --> 3:15:54.140]  to blame it on Muslims. And the FBI said this is run of the mill. No big deal. But I had
[3:15:54.140 --> 3:15:58.660]  bio weapons experts on saying this is incredibly deadly. Only Russia, the United States and
[3:15:58.660 --> 3:16:02.940]  England can make it this deadly. Then it turned out it was the super miniaturized with the
[3:16:02.940 --> 3:16:10.580]  bentonite magnetized. I mean, it was the special, you know, sci-fi grade U.S. signature. And
[3:16:10.580 --> 3:16:15.180]  of course the film covers that. And then the different Patsy's and then murdering a Patsy.
[3:16:15.180 --> 3:16:18.900]  And they finally got a Patsy. They could shut up because, you know, the last two Patsy's
[3:16:18.900 --> 3:16:23.700]  were proven innocent. So let's go over that. But I mean, you guys are journalists, TV guys,
[3:16:23.700 --> 3:16:28.540]  you were there at the time. Wasn't for a week or so the anthrax as big as 9-11. And
[3:16:28.540 --> 3:16:31.260]  then it's like it never happened.
[3:16:31.260 --> 3:16:39.180]  Absolutely. I mean, you know, this was our sort of scariest nightmare come to life. The
[3:16:39.180 --> 3:16:44.340]  attack of invisible germs. You know, this is something you do not see. These were, you
[3:16:44.340 --> 3:16:48.940]  know, who sent it. It went through the mail. This is an attack against all of us because
[3:16:48.940 --> 3:16:52.700]  it was sent through the mail. This is going to go on to everybody and it was everybody
[3:16:52.700 --> 3:16:55.700]  gets the mail, the perfect psychology.
[3:16:55.700 --> 3:17:05.340]  And in some ways it also fed on fears that had been tickled, let's say, by so many of
[3:17:05.340 --> 3:17:12.100]  these Hollywood movies about, you know, bio attacks. But here was, you know, real life.
[3:17:12.100 --> 3:17:17.860]  And so, yeah, it caused huge panic across the U.S., across the globe. There were copycat
[3:17:17.860 --> 3:17:25.780]  attacks, you know, Cipro, this antibiotic that was the treatment for anthrax. Their
[3:17:25.780 --> 3:17:31.820]  stocks went through the roof. People were buying Cipro. But as you said, Alex, you know,
[3:17:31.820 --> 3:17:37.060]  after a couple of weeks of being in the headlines, the story faded. The FBI announced it had
[3:17:37.060 --> 3:17:44.900]  this huge investigation, but it's pretty quickly seemed that that investigation was not going
[3:17:44.900 --> 3:17:52.300]  anywhere. I mean, they had a so-called person of interest, this Army scientist by the name
[3:17:52.300 --> 3:17:58.340]  of Stephen Hatfield. And very early on, the FBI were convinced that they could blame it
[3:17:58.340 --> 3:18:04.540]  on one person. There was a lone gunman. You know, there was just one person behind this.
[3:18:04.540 --> 3:18:09.260]  And that's one of the things that we decided to look at. We said, well, actually, you know,
[3:18:09.260 --> 3:18:13.100]  it's much bigger than this. We've actually got to look at this from an international
[3:18:13.100 --> 3:18:20.780]  perspective because, you know, the kind of anthrax that was sent, especially to Congress,
[3:18:20.780 --> 3:18:29.780]  was very, very sophisticated. When the FBI scientists examined the anthrax that we used
[3:18:29.780 --> 3:18:36.460]  in the attacks against the congressman, that anthrax, when they examined it in the lab,
[3:18:36.460 --> 3:18:44.780]  in the BSL3 lab, high containment lab, they put it on a microscope and the anthrax actually
[3:18:44.780 --> 3:18:52.300]  lifted up and floated into the air. And the scientists had never seen any anthrax of this
[3:18:52.300 --> 3:18:57.180]  sophistication ever before. So this was super sophisticated anthrax. And it really meant
[3:18:57.180 --> 3:19:00.780]  that this had come out of a state-sponsored program.
[3:19:00.780 --> 3:19:07.100]  That's right. It was the U.S. government weapon strain. It was miniaturized. It was magnetized.
[3:19:07.100 --> 3:19:11.860]  It was coated in bentonite. It was made to float around.
[3:19:11.860 --> 3:19:16.740]  Well, the thing was, the original report said it was coated in bentonite. And that was put
[3:19:16.740 --> 3:19:17.740]  forth by...
[3:19:17.740 --> 3:19:18.740]  So that's right.
[3:19:18.740 --> 3:19:24.060]  It is wrong. And it was put forth by ABC News correspondent Brian Ross. There was no bentonite
[3:19:24.060 --> 3:19:31.540]  in that, but it was very useful because U.S. intelligence had identified bentonite as an
[3:19:31.540 --> 3:19:37.980]  additive that the Iraqis had. So you see how the administration began to say, ah, there's
[3:19:37.980 --> 3:19:41.780]  an Iraqi connection because of this bentonite connection.
[3:19:41.780 --> 3:19:46.300]  Well, stay there, gentlemen. I want to go over this. I want to go over this anthrax war.
[3:19:46.300 --> 3:19:49.180]  We've got to go to break. When we come back, I want to go through the evidence that it's
[3:19:49.180 --> 3:19:55.180]  an inside job or a cover-up. But also, what were the motives? Was it an aborted false flag
[3:19:55.180 --> 3:19:58.820]  to blame Iraq?
[3:19:58.820 --> 3:20:01.380]  Where did the trail lead?
[3:20:01.380 --> 3:20:05.900]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[3:20:05.900 --> 3:20:09.780]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago. He was devastated, but it taught him
[3:20:09.780 --> 3:20:14.300]  a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss
[3:20:14.300 --> 3:20:18.740]  tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security. You are always
[3:20:18.740 --> 3:20:23.900]  in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own
[3:20:23.900 --> 3:20:27.060]  business. Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[3:20:27.060 --> 3:20:32.740]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years, and he is passionate about turning other people
[3:20:32.740 --> 3:20:37.900]  on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others. MZ wants to

[3:24:17.260 --> 3:24:27.660]  And this film is really well done. Everybody needs to see Anthrax War. I mean, the White
[3:24:27.660 --> 3:24:32.660]  House, Ari Fleischer admitting that much of the White House was on Cipro starting September
[3:24:32.660 --> 3:24:36.980]  10th through the attacks, but nobody else was when they knew it was going to be going
[3:24:36.980 --> 3:24:41.620]  through the capital mail system and some of it to the White House. I mean, this is really,
[3:24:41.620 --> 3:24:47.380]  really suspicious. But that's only one area. Going back to our guest, the makers of Anthrax
[3:24:47.380 --> 3:24:53.580]  War, Bob Cohn and Eric Nadler, you guys know how to tell this story best. You guys have
[3:24:53.580 --> 3:24:59.060]  got the floor. This is a short segment. Long one's coming up. Run through what the film
[3:24:59.060 --> 3:25:04.660]  covers, the evidence and bottom line, what your conclusion is, what the Anthrax attacks
[3:25:04.660 --> 3:25:12.860]  really were in Anthrax War? Well, the deal is, one has to look at who benefited
[3:25:12.860 --> 3:25:20.340]  and who gained, ultimately, from the Anthrax attacks. When the FBI named lone male man
[3:25:20.340 --> 3:25:30.420]  Bruce Evans as their guy, they said he had a profit motive, $2,000 government contracts
[3:25:30.420 --> 3:25:37.860]  or whatever to get the Anthrax vaccine that he was working on in Fort Detrick, Maryland
[3:25:37.860 --> 3:25:46.900]  to be reinvigorated and put forth for the U.S. military troops. We asked a legitimate
[3:25:46.900 --> 3:25:53.900]  question. If they're saying profit motive for a lone gunman, who really made money
[3:25:53.900 --> 3:25:59.580]  off his attacks? And we have to be careful here. We're not really pointing any fingers,
[3:25:59.580 --> 3:26:08.980]  but we're suggesting that one looks at what is the real legacy of the Anthrax attacks.
[3:26:08.980 --> 3:26:15.900]  And without a doubt, within the last few years, the U.S. government, in the wake of the Anthrax
[3:26:15.900 --> 3:26:25.380]  attacks, has leased $50 to $60 billion in what they call biodefense contracts to fight
[3:26:25.380 --> 3:26:31.340]  against bioterrorism. And one of the things we do in the film and one of the things we
[3:26:31.340 --> 3:26:39.300]  do in the book is begin to examine the corporate connections, who's making the money, who's
[3:26:39.300 --> 3:26:46.600]  making the $50 to $60 billion. And once the FBI lets the profit motive as the attack
[3:26:46.600 --> 3:26:55.980]  lay into Ivan's, we think that's a real legitimate place to look. And in the book, we spend a
[3:26:55.980 --> 3:27:08.900]  lot of time looking at very politically wired corporations that have benefited, no doubt,
[3:27:08.900 --> 3:27:14.740]  through government contracts in the government response to the Anthrax attacks.
[3:27:14.740 --> 3:27:21.300]  Absolutely. In fact, expanding on that, and I want Mr. Kohn's take on this as well, and
[3:27:21.300 --> 3:27:27.140]  of course yours, Mr. Nadler, is, as you said, $50 plus billion for bio shield and other
[3:27:27.140 --> 3:27:34.940]  programs level for bio weapons labs in major cities, expanding the U.S. bio weapons program
[3:27:34.940 --> 3:27:42.180]  in a cover for bio weapon defense, even mainstream news has admitted that they wouldn't have
[3:27:42.180 --> 3:27:47.620]  gotten all of this if it wasn't for the Anthrax attacks. They got all those major contracts
[3:27:47.620 --> 3:27:53.660]  and that policy shift in the war on terror right after the Anthrax attack.
[3:27:53.660 --> 3:28:00.460]  Absolutely. And certainly that has been one concrete result of the Anthrax attacks is
[3:28:00.460 --> 3:28:10.100]  the birth of what we describe as the bioterror military industrial complex. And the other
[3:28:10.100 --> 3:28:15.460]  troubling thing about all this is that what used to be the domain of secret government
[3:28:15.460 --> 3:28:22.580]  programs is now privatized. So we have private corporations who are doing this classified
[3:28:22.580 --> 3:28:30.420]  research that's going on in private labs, in university labs, in private research foundations,
[3:28:30.420 --> 3:28:34.980]  all around the country. People have no idea what's going on in those labs. There's very
[3:28:34.980 --> 3:28:40.380]  little oversight and because of a lot of this is actually private, there's really no way
[3:28:40.380 --> 3:28:44.580]  of finding out what's going on in those labs because a lot of that is protected by trade
[3:28:44.580 --> 3:28:52.860]  secrets. So there are a lot of very, very troubling questions. A lot of experts, scientists
[3:28:52.860 --> 3:28:58.900]  that we spoke to all around the world who are very, very concerned about all this because
[3:28:58.900 --> 3:29:03.780]  we have to remember one thing, the world of germ weapons. There's very little difference,
[3:29:03.780 --> 3:29:12.820]  the line between what is offensive bio weapons research and defensive research is very blurry.
[3:29:12.820 --> 3:29:19.060]  We have to remember offensive biological weapons are actually outlawed by international treaties.
[3:29:19.060 --> 3:29:26.140]  Only defensive research is allowed. But in order to develop, we got a great long segment
[3:29:26.140 --> 3:29:31.100]  coming up, plenty of time for both of you to go through this story. But I don't want
[3:29:31.100 --> 3:29:35.820]  to miss the elephant in the room here. The government of the United States, England,
[3:29:35.820 --> 3:29:41.260]  you name it, have been caught over and over again, testing radiological, chemicals, biologicals
[3:29:41.260 --> 3:29:48.900]  on their own populations, including lethal pathogens on foster children, veterans, the
[3:29:48.900 --> 3:29:56.740]  military, minorities, so. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[3:29:56.740 --> 3:30:04.940]  GCN radio network. The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even

[3:31:05.100 --> 3:31:10.420]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[3:31:10.420 --> 3:31:15.500]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[3:31:15.500 --> 3:31:19.660]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and
[3:31:19.660 --> 3:31:24.820]  developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric

[3:32:02.220 --> 3:32:07.820]  Most Americans know the significance of July 4th, 1776. However, few know the importance
[3:32:07.820 --> 3:32:15.300]  of September 17th, 1787, the day the Constitution was written and adopted by our founders. Unfortunately,
[3:32:15.300 --> 3:32:21.060]  over 200 years later, this sacred document is under attack along with our beloved Republic.
[3:32:21.060 --> 3:32:24.780]  Throughout the span of history, brave men and women have rallied behind banners which
[3:32:24.780 --> 3:32:30.220]  have served as symbols of liberty against the forces of tyranny. Today, we have the Constitution

[3:33:08.380 --> 3:33:25.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, they launched the anthrax attacks. They use it to pass the Patriot Act.
[3:33:25.460 --> 3:33:31.420]  All these political enemies of Bush get hit with it. Bush is on Cipro before 9-11 with
[3:33:31.420 --> 3:33:38.220]  the White House staff. This film is so important. It's anthrax war, a film by Bob Cone and
[3:33:38.220 --> 3:33:45.740]  Eric Nadler. We have it discounted out of the gates. Just came out at info wars.com.
[3:33:45.740 --> 3:33:50.460]  We hope everybody gets it and shows it to people because this is just more evidence
[3:33:50.460 --> 3:33:54.340]  of the people running our system. We're not very friendly or not very nice. And it's
[3:33:54.340 --> 3:34:04.780]  a gateway into a whole larger world. You can also call toll free to get it 888-253-3139-888-2533139.
[3:34:04.780 --> 3:34:09.100]  We're trying to say something, Mr. Nadler, one of the filmmakers as we went to break.
[3:34:09.100 --> 3:34:10.100]  Go ahead.
[3:34:10.100 --> 3:34:15.620]  Well, basically, I can't recall the exact point, but I like to pick up on your point
[3:34:15.620 --> 3:34:23.580]  that there is a permanent government that will not go beyond the official narrative,
[3:34:23.580 --> 3:34:31.300]  be it Obama, be it Bush, be it Clinton. In other words, when it comes to very serious
[3:34:31.300 --> 3:34:37.940]  foreign policy pieces of business, like the anthrax attacks in 9-1-1-1, there is a line
[3:34:37.940 --> 3:34:45.540]  drawn in the sand. In other words, the biggest impediment, I believe, to a real honest investigation
[3:34:45.540 --> 3:34:53.460]  of these anthrax attacks is a real spotlight upon the FBI investigation, which is called
[3:34:53.460 --> 3:34:59.060]  the largest in our nation's history. Seven years, they went all around the world, issued
[3:34:59.060 --> 3:35:06.340]  5,500 subpoenas. Supposedly, they want you to make it think that it's the best investigation
[3:35:06.340 --> 3:35:12.460]  in the world. Obama comes in, he cleans house with everyone. Who does he keep? FBI director
[3:35:12.460 --> 3:35:18.340]  Robert Mueller, the guy in charge of the anthrax investigation. And when Mueller goes on to
[3:35:18.340 --> 3:35:26.860]  testify in September 2008, he is grilled by Senator Patrick Leahy. It's something in
[3:35:26.860 --> 3:35:35.660]  our film that I think is the most interesting scene. Leahy, a target of the attacks, and
[3:35:35.660 --> 3:35:41.820]  the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee with oversight over the FBI, who for seven
[3:35:41.820 --> 3:35:48.060]  years basically did not speak of the anthrax attacks. When we called him out early on,
[3:35:48.060 --> 3:35:54.140]  we heard from his press spokesman, Senator Leahy never speaks about the anthrax attacks
[3:35:54.140 --> 3:36:03.500]  at any time. Whoa. But in September 2008, one month after the FBI named Ivins as lone
[3:36:03.500 --> 3:36:11.460]  gunman, Leahy looks right into the eyes of Mueller and says, Director Mueller, I do not
[3:36:11.460 --> 3:36:20.300]  believe that if Ivins was involved, that he was the only person who could be charged with
[3:36:20.300 --> 3:36:30.780]  murder. Whoa. This was not Internet chatter, not Alex Jones chatter. This was the chairman
[3:36:30.780 --> 3:36:37.500]  of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a recipient of the anthrax letters, a man with direct
[3:36:37.500 --> 3:36:47.740]  oversight of the FBI, charging conspiracy and coverup of the largest unsolved serial
[3:36:47.740 --> 3:36:55.980]  murder investigation in FBI history. And the fact that this new president, Obama, does
[3:36:55.980 --> 3:37:01.060]  not come forth and saying, let's get to the bottom of this, makes me think that there
[3:37:01.060 --> 3:37:06.420]  really is kind of a permanent government that draws a line in the sand and does not go
[3:37:06.420 --> 3:37:10.980]  further. Well, that's a whole other area. And I want both of you to respond to this.
[3:37:10.980 --> 3:37:18.700]  The suspicious death of the Patsy of the lone gunman, he, from what I've read and some
[3:37:18.700 --> 3:37:24.100]  of what the film covers, was actually investigating the anthrax and looking into it. They already
[3:37:24.100 --> 3:37:30.580]  tried to burn several other Patsy's, a Middle Eastern American scientist, the South African
[3:37:30.580 --> 3:37:34.780]  guy. They said some other people might have done it. Earth, they said Arabs had done it
[3:37:34.780 --> 3:37:40.060]  and scribbling, trying to frame Iraq. But you guys are the experts that totally have
[3:37:40.060 --> 3:37:45.860]  been focusing on this, so enlighten me here. Then we noticed in just a few news articles
[3:37:45.860 --> 3:37:51.900]  buried but nowhere on national news that the Patsy had been grabbed, put in a mental institution
[3:37:51.900 --> 3:37:59.660]  and then been in lockdown and died of prescription strength Tylenol. I mean, how bizarre is that?
[3:37:59.660 --> 3:38:05.860]  And there wasn't anything about him being in government custody in the headlines that
[3:38:05.860 --> 3:38:13.140]  itself was suspicious. And then it was that's it. Patsy's dead. I mean, this, so they tried
[3:38:13.140 --> 3:38:18.460]  over and over again with different Patsy's. Finally, they got a Patsy that couldn't, couldn't
[3:38:18.460 --> 3:38:22.220]  argue with them or, I mean, just the suspicious death alone.
[3:38:22.220 --> 3:38:26.660]  Well, we have to remember the first guy that they, the person of interest that they initially
[3:38:26.660 --> 3:38:32.540]  focused on was this, another US Army scientist, Stephen Hatfield. And they said they never
[3:38:32.540 --> 3:38:39.420]  named him as a suspect, but his name was leaked to the media. He was pounded by the FBI. And
[3:38:39.420 --> 3:38:45.140]  you know, Hatfield was a tough guy. He sued. He sued the media. He sued the FBI. And last
[3:38:45.140 --> 3:38:50.420]  year he got, they settled with them for the government settled with him for almost $6
[3:38:50.420 --> 3:38:57.660]  million and basically cleared him of all wrongdoing. And just a few weeks later, the FBI announces,
[3:38:57.660 --> 3:39:03.900]  Hey, we've got our guy. The only problem is he's just committed suicide. And you're right.
[3:39:03.900 --> 3:39:10.540]  Bruce I was also a US Army scientist, and he did help the FBI early in the investigation
[3:39:10.540 --> 3:39:19.220]  into the anthrax attacks. And the FBI claimed that he got onto their radar a few months
[3:39:19.220 --> 3:39:26.900]  before a little bit longer than that before he committed suicide. He was put under extreme
[3:39:26.900 --> 3:39:34.100]  pressure again. He was harassed by the FBI. His children were even approached and offered.
[3:39:34.100 --> 3:39:40.140]  I think his son was offered a sports car, a Corvette, if he could rat out his father.
[3:39:40.140 --> 3:39:47.020]  His security clearance was, was withdrawn. And Bruce Evans, you know, was made out in
[3:39:47.020 --> 3:39:54.300]  the media to have some mental problems. But it's, it's true. He was put on a lot of duress.
[3:39:54.300 --> 3:40:00.820]  And the FBI a year ago announced that, yeah, we've got our guy. He's just committed suicide.
[3:40:00.820 --> 3:40:09.060]  The official story is that Bruce Evans, you know, was drinking heavily and took some,
[3:40:09.060 --> 3:40:18.460]  some prescription Tylenol and was found unconscious and taken to a hospital and, you know, died
[3:40:18.460 --> 3:40:24.500]  two years, two days later. But the interesting thing, Alex, is that we were actually in the
[3:40:24.500 --> 3:40:30.540]  edit room editing anthrax war at the time, you know, last year when this happened. And
[3:40:30.540 --> 3:40:37.180]  at that point, you know, the anthrax attacks were still unsolved. And it was very interesting
[3:40:37.180 --> 3:40:44.300]  because Bruce Evans is actually the fifth dead scientist in our film. And we'd followed
[3:40:44.300 --> 3:40:50.220]  a whole trail of death scientists in our investigation, beginning with the death of David Kelly,
[3:40:50.220 --> 3:40:58.220]  the weapons expert who was an arms inspector in Iraq, who you might remember died in 2003,
[3:40:58.220 --> 3:41:03.700]  just after the invasion of Iraq, where he was found dead in the woods in a year's home
[3:41:03.700 --> 3:41:10.980]  in Oxford. And so we'd been looking into a whole spate of mysterious deaths of German
[3:41:10.980 --> 3:41:17.180]  warfare scientists, all of whom were working with anthrax.
[3:41:17.180 --> 3:41:22.820]  Go through some of those deaths because it's not just the five suspicious anthrax connection
[3:41:22.820 --> 3:41:27.700]  deaths. There are hundreds and hundreds of microbiologists and people in key bio weapons
[3:41:27.700 --> 3:41:33.620]  development and bio weapons fingerprinting, especially being murdered. I mean, there'll
[3:41:33.620 --> 3:41:39.180]  be people at university in Houston, a van in a five mile an hour zone runs over them
[3:41:39.180 --> 3:41:43.940]  in front of the students and then backs back over and leaves or people will be one guy
[3:41:43.940 --> 3:41:48.860]  in Virginia. The Washington Post reported was like satanically sacrificed with all his
[3:41:48.860 --> 3:41:54.140]  guts ripped out and heart cut out and pentagrams carved in him. Others are drowned in puddles
[3:41:54.140 --> 3:41:59.060]  of water. Others get double capped in the head. And I'm sure most of it isn't involving
[3:41:59.060 --> 3:42:03.860]  this case, but other cases of cover ups. I mean, I wouldn't want to be a microbiologist
[3:42:03.860 --> 3:42:06.020]  working in or around government programs.
[3:42:06.020 --> 3:42:15.540]  In fact, that is the sentiment that was expressed by John Eldridge, a Englishman who is the
[3:42:15.540 --> 3:42:23.460]  editor of Jane's Defense Weekly's chemical and biological defense news report, perhaps
[3:42:23.460 --> 3:42:32.140]  the most sophisticated analysis of chemical and biological weapons used by UN's weapons
[3:42:32.140 --> 3:42:39.780]  inspectors. It has a long history of being a reputable piece of business. And he said
[3:42:39.780 --> 3:42:47.580]  when looking at this spate of dead scientists, he said, geez, I would not like to be a microbiologist.
[3:42:47.580 --> 3:42:55.340]  And this quote has been confirmed in a couple of places. Now, look, the list does grow if
[3:42:55.340 --> 3:43:01.140]  you go to internet sites at 40, 50, 60, 70, and I've seen it more than that. I've seen
[3:43:01.140 --> 3:43:05.460]  it more than that if you add them all together. I mean, over the last, because I mean, I was
[3:43:05.460 --> 3:43:10.620]  seeing lists before the anthrax attacks before 2000. I mean, you may be talking about some
[3:43:10.620 --> 3:43:17.420]  of the modern list, but I mean, take Dr. David Kelly. He sends emails saying, I'll be found
[3:43:17.420 --> 3:43:21.380]  dead in the woods if I speak out. He tells friends. He tells people I've interviewed
[3:43:21.380 --> 3:43:28.060]  on the show. He is writing a tell all book on them. Locals come up in the park, see five
[3:43:28.060 --> 3:43:33.060]  guys in black uniforms run away from his dead body. There's no blood at the scene or very
[3:43:33.060 --> 3:43:38.220]  little from slit wrist. There's three undissolved pills in his stomach. And they say he died
[3:43:38.220 --> 3:43:43.020]  of slitting his wrist and pills. I mean, this is, I mean, could my dead body, could I be
[3:43:43.020 --> 3:43:48.120]  seen with black ops standing over me with witnesses and still, I mean, maybe they could
[3:43:48.120 --> 3:43:53.100]  blow my head off on TV and say I killed myself. I mean, I mean, this is getting ridiculous.
[3:43:53.100 --> 3:43:58.780]  Yeah, well, you know, anything can happen in this modern media age. And I think the
[3:43:58.780 --> 3:44:04.660]  story about Kelly is very instructive. I mean, Kelly's death has been suspicious from
[3:44:04.660 --> 3:44:11.620]  the get go. In our film, anthrax war, we interview a member of parliament, Norman Baker, who
[3:44:11.620 --> 3:44:18.380]  takes a full year off from his responsibilities to investigate Kelly's death. This is no kind
[3:44:18.380 --> 3:44:23.220]  of, you know, out of mainstream guides, a member of the British parliament. And he ends
[3:44:23.220 --> 3:44:29.340]  up writing a book called the strange death of David Kelly. And he says David Kelly was
[3:44:29.340 --> 3:44:37.900]  murdered. And this is an astounding claim that has just been endorsed by 13 leading
[3:44:37.900 --> 3:44:44.100]  British doctors who have petitioned and hired a lawyer to ask that the brown government
[3:44:44.100 --> 3:44:51.660]  in England, which is now considering a review of the Blair policies that led to the war
[3:44:51.660 --> 3:44:56.740]  in Iraq. They have four areas they want to investigate from the Downing Street memo,
[3:44:56.740 --> 3:45:04.740]  which you know about, etc., to the death of David Kelly. And basically, the rap on Kelly
[3:45:04.740 --> 3:45:12.180]  is the most telling piece of evidence that MP Norman Baker discovered was that the knife
[3:45:12.180 --> 3:45:20.780]  he supposedly used as he went to the woods all depressed about being officially sacrificed
[3:45:20.780 --> 3:45:26.780]  by the British government as a leak that destroyed their case for war. All depressed, he went
[3:45:26.780 --> 3:45:33.060]  into the woods and he took a knife, he slit his wrists, and he swallowed some tablets
[3:45:33.060 --> 3:45:39.780]  from his wife's medicine cabinet. What Baker got the police to admit was that there was
[3:45:39.780 --> 3:45:48.180]  no fingerprints on the knife. Well, how do you kill yourself? No fingerprints, no glove.
[3:45:48.180 --> 3:45:56.420]  And the Kelly murder, and I don't say suicide, I say murder, because I really do believe
[3:45:56.420 --> 3:46:03.460]  it was a murder, as do 70% of the British public and a growing percentage of the opinion
[3:46:03.460 --> 3:46:12.460]  leaders in the UK who killed Kelly becomes a very important piece of business. And he
[3:46:12.460 --> 3:46:21.420]  becomes the poster boy, poster child, poster man for these 100 or so other suspicious deaths
[3:46:21.420 --> 3:46:27.540]  of microbiologists. In fact, one of the things we mentioned to a member of parliament who
[3:46:27.540 --> 3:46:35.740]  has mentioned to us that he'll be entering interviews we did for our film into the official
[3:46:35.740 --> 3:46:46.580]  parliamentary inquiry into Kelly's death and the rush to war, basically he said that the
[3:46:46.580 --> 3:46:56.380]  Kelly death combined with the death of Kelly's successor as the head of microbiology, the
[3:46:56.380 --> 3:47:03.980]  germ warfare plant, important down in England, he died in a light airplane crash, a suspicious
[3:47:03.980 --> 3:47:12.180]  crash 11 months after Kelly. It's kind of mind blowing. What we do in our film anthrax
[3:47:12.180 --> 3:47:19.460]  work and we do in our book, Dead Silence, is we begin to show that to work in this field
[3:47:19.460 --> 3:47:26.860]  of germ warfare is dangerous to your health because you end up killing yourself, suicide,
[3:47:26.860 --> 3:47:31.340]  the official story or something else worse happens to you.
[3:47:31.340 --> 3:47:36.820]  Yeah. I mean, I mean, also you got to look at what are these guys doing? And we decided
[3:47:36.820 --> 3:47:42.660]  to look at Kelly and what was his job in germ warfare? What was he doing? And what was he
[3:47:42.660 --> 3:47:50.540]  doing at Porton Down, this lab which is the US defense department, excuse me, the United
[3:47:50.540 --> 3:47:55.420]  Kingdom's secret lab where they do all their germ research. And one of the things that
[3:47:55.420 --> 3:48:03.260]  we discovered was that Porton Down has got a long history of human experiments of testing
[3:48:03.260 --> 3:48:08.860]  bio weapons on volunteers. And chemical, and chemical actually killed
[3:48:08.860 --> 3:48:12.700]  some people in association with that. I've had some of their family members on, they'd
[3:48:12.700 --> 3:48:17.540]  march them in, tell them they were going to test a bio, hit them with Saren or VX.
[3:48:17.540 --> 3:48:18.540]  Exactly.
[3:48:18.540 --> 3:48:25.460]  Yeah, but expanding on that, I found they create their cadres of killers, these things
[3:48:25.460 --> 3:48:30.540]  too. They find scientists that believe the unjustifies the means. And then sometimes
[3:48:30.540 --> 3:48:34.100]  they kind of wake up and realize what's happened. That's why they've got to be killed. But I
[3:48:34.100 --> 3:48:38.020]  just want to add before we're out of time here to blitz through other key points made
[3:48:38.020 --> 3:48:45.460]  in the film. People need to support alternative news filmmakers in cinema. And you guys are
[3:48:45.460 --> 3:48:51.060]  great filmmakers, award-winning filmmakers. You know, I went over your bio earlier. Anthrax
[3:48:51.060 --> 3:48:56.500]  War needs to be seen. And we've got these up on infowars.com. They're available. I want
[3:48:56.500 --> 3:49:02.860]  everybody to get the full picture in this film at infowars.com. Anthrax War, a film
[3:49:02.860 --> 3:49:11.980]  by Bob Cohn and Eric Nadler. Again, available at infowars.com or 888-253-3139. Mr. Cohn,
[3:49:11.980 --> 3:49:16.220]  go ahead and finish the point you were making when I interrupted there. And then in the
[3:49:16.220 --> 3:49:20.780]  time we've got left, rattle off some of the other key points and interesting things because
[3:49:20.780 --> 3:49:24.460]  there's so much in this film and then so much other stuff, I'm sure you discovered that
[3:49:24.460 --> 3:49:26.180]  you didn't have time to put in the film.
[3:49:26.180 --> 3:49:30.940]  Well, you know, we were talking about David Kelly and we discovered, you know, that David
[3:49:30.940 --> 3:49:35.620]  Kelly was working at Porton Down where, you know, he headed the microbiology department
[3:49:35.620 --> 3:49:40.620]  for many years there. And they were involved, like you said, in human experiments at Porton
[3:49:40.620 --> 3:49:47.380]  Down on the servicemen. And there was a huge police investigation by the local police there
[3:49:47.380 --> 3:49:53.340]  into these human experiments. And they were looking at scientists and possibly quite possibly
[3:49:53.340 --> 3:49:59.740]  Kelly's was a target of this investigation. The other thing we discovered about Kelly
[3:49:59.740 --> 3:50:06.660]  was his relationship with the apartheid era, South African apartheid era secret German weapons
[3:50:06.660 --> 3:50:13.660]  program. During the apartheid years, South Africa had a small but very sophisticated
[3:50:13.660 --> 3:50:18.740]  German war program. And one of the aims of this program was to come up with something
[3:50:18.740 --> 3:50:22.980]  that they called the black bomb. And that was an ethnic weapon.
[3:50:22.980 --> 3:50:27.700]  A specific bio weapon. And Cheney then wrote about that. We're going to come back and discuss
[3:50:27.700 --> 3:50:32.820]  that after this quick break in the final segment. Cheney in his September 20th 2000 rebuilding
[3:50:32.820 --> 3:50:38.700]  America's defenses said we need to legitimize the use of these race specific bio weapons.
[3:50:38.700 --> 3:50:43.740]  So gentlemen, I'm glad you got into that. I forgot to bring that up. And just just amazing
[3:50:43.740 --> 3:50:49.420]  information. Of course, you interview the head of the South African program. It's anthrax
[3:50:49.420 --> 3:50:55.220]  war available at info wars.com folks. You got to get this movie. This needs to be seen
[3:50:55.220 --> 3:51:02.860]  by everybody. We've got to point out this false flag event.

[3:52:05.620 --> 3:52:10.860]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind
[3:52:10.860 --> 3:52:16.340]  of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception, completely
[3:52:16.340 --> 3:52:20.900]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:20.900 --> 3:52:25.580]  Well Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have
[3:52:25.580 --> 3:52:30.540]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the
[3:52:30.540 --> 3:52:38.700]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not
[3:52:38.700 --> 3:52:43.900]  about left or right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[3:52:43.900 --> 3:52:50.700]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception

[3:54:08.780 --> 3:54:12.780]  Folks, I don't want to bash this company but I was at the health food stores, I'm trying
[3:54:12.780 --> 3:54:18.380]  to get healthy again, grabbing liquid natural vitamins and minerals and I've always
[3:54:18.380 --> 3:54:22.740]  joked that they'd start putting mercury on the store shelves because I've got national
[3:54:22.740 --> 3:54:26.940]  federal reports saying mercury's now good for you which is just completely ridiculous.
[3:54:26.940 --> 3:54:33.700]  All the studies show one of the most deadly heavy metals. Here is a popular liquid vitamin.
[3:54:33.700 --> 3:54:38.380]  I'm not going to say the name. I mean they can zoom out, I can show you the bigger bottle
[3:54:38.380 --> 3:54:44.580]  but I don't want to be mean to this company because they may just be nuts but there it
[3:54:44.580 --> 3:54:51.260]  is, mercury. I mean and I wasn't paying attention. The person at the store recommended though
[3:54:51.260 --> 3:54:59.460]  this is a really good brand and maybe I'll get them, maybe I'm wrong, maybe lead's good
[3:54:59.460 --> 3:55:04.540]  for you like CNBC says, maybe I've been wrong, maybe the flu shot is good. Folks, I wanted
[3:55:04.540 --> 3:55:08.620]  to say bye to our guest here. I want to have them back up because they've certainly had
[3:55:08.620 --> 3:55:11.820]  some very informative adventures. The film is Anthrax War. Next time they come, we'll
[3:55:11.820 --> 3:55:18.300]  play some clips of it at prismplanet.tv for you. I do want to thank a sponsor though here
[3:55:18.300 --> 3:55:23.300]  at the end of the show before we finish up with race specific bio weapons with the makers
[3:55:23.300 --> 3:55:29.460]  of Anthrax War and that is eFoodsDirect.com. In these insane times when we're being told
[3:55:29.460 --> 3:55:33.340]  mercury's good for us and they're talking about depression and wars with Iran, the rest

[3:56:17.380 --> 3:56:23.340]  to. In closing Mr. Cohn, you were getting into Anthrax War and race specific bio weapons
[3:56:23.340 --> 3:56:29.020]  out of South Africa. Yeah, one of the things we did is we traveled down to South Africa
[3:56:29.020 --> 3:56:36.300]  to see how the South African program, the apartheid era program that was run there by
[3:56:36.300 --> 3:56:44.220]  a guy called Dr. Death Votabassan. And during the 1980s he set up a very sophisticated secret
[3:56:44.220 --> 3:56:48.900]  germ war program with about 200 scientists. And one of their main aims was to come up
[3:56:48.900 --> 3:56:55.460]  with this black bomb. An ethnic specific bio weapon would target black people. There
[3:56:55.460 --> 3:57:01.060]  are a lot of questions about if they were actually succeeded in doing it. He claims
[3:57:01.060 --> 3:57:07.140]  that they never succeeded but they were actively he admits in his interview with us in the
[3:57:07.140 --> 3:57:15.580]  film on camera that they did in fact were trying to develop a vaccine or something
[3:57:15.580 --> 3:57:21.860]  that they could actually give to women to make them infertile and admits that he had
[3:57:21.860 --> 3:57:27.180]  work in relationships with the US government, with the British government. He visited for
[3:57:27.180 --> 3:57:34.420]  Dietrich, the US government germ warfare lab. He visited Portland down in the United Kingdom.
[3:57:34.420 --> 3:57:40.500]  He admitted a relationship with Bassan and he said we were asked to develop this ethnic
[3:57:40.500 --> 3:57:47.740]  weapon by another country. Well he didn't say we pushed him and he did not say what
[3:57:47.740 --> 3:57:50.660]  to do. No, no, but it's come out that he worked with Israel to try to sterilize the
[3:57:50.660 --> 3:57:55.300]  Arabs. Gentlemen, I've got to have you back up just on that because as you said this is
[3:57:55.300 --> 3:58:01.260]  a gateway, a portal into everything else. Anthrax war, get it at infowars.com folks.
