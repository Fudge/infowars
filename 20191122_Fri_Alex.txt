[00:00.000 --> 00:08.300]  The American Apple World is a warrior.
[00:08.300 --> 00:09.300]  We are one.
[00:09.300 --> 00:13.200]  The United States is the United States.
[00:13.200 --> 00:15.700]  United States is the United States.
[00:15.700 --> 00:20.200]  November 27, 2019, get ready.
[00:20.200 --> 00:23.200]  The United States is the United States.
[00:23.200 --> 00:25.200]  The United States is the United States.
[00:25.200 --> 00:31.200]  Wild Horse is teamwork. A series of ghosts roams down in the sand.
[00:31.200 --> 00:36.100]  The 33,284 in 1776.
[00:36.100 --> 00:44.200]  You lost them and your powers has won back.
[00:44.200 --> 00:51.200]  The 33,284 in 17 existing.
[00:51.200 --> 00:55.600]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of the American people!
[00:56.200 --> 01:00.200]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of America!
[01:01.200 --> 01:02.200]  Help!
[01:02.700 --> 01:08.200]  Hillary Clinton is openly calling for censorship of all take-offs and nationalists!
[01:08.700 --> 01:10.700]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal!
[01:11.200 --> 01:15.200]  We failed to steal our nation out of the sitcom!
[01:15.700 --> 01:18.200]  Hillary Clinton is an criminal!
[01:18.200 --> 01:23.200]  Hillary Clinton will never silence the American people!
[01:23.700 --> 01:25.700]  America is awake!
[01:26.200 --> 01:28.200]  America knows what's happening!
[01:28.700 --> 01:32.700]  And if all ours dot com is exposing it!
[01:33.200 --> 01:34.700]  America is back!
[01:35.200 --> 01:36.700]  America is back!
[01:37.200 --> 01:38.700]  America is back!
[01:39.200 --> 01:40.700]  America is back!
[01:41.200 --> 01:42.700]  America is back!
[01:43.200 --> 01:44.700]  America is back!
[01:44.700 --> 01:46.700]  America is back!
[02:14.700 --> 02:19.000]  Hillary Clinton is involved with Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.600]  Hillary Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile aircraft.
[02:23.600 --> 02:31.600]  Democrats are authoritarian, the entire American criminals that failed to silence our speech.
[02:31.600 --> 02:40.600]  Big Tech and the Chicoms and Hillary have failed to silence America's speech.
[02:40.600 --> 02:51.600]  America is back, America is back, America is back, America is back, America is back.
[02:51.600 --> 02:56.600]  Hillary Clinton worked with the child by Esther Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:56.600 --> 03:02.600]  Hillary Clinton wants to sexualize our children. Hillary Clinton is a long run around.
[03:02.600 --> 03:17.600]  Hillary Clinton is a failure. Your Democratic Party is collapsing. Every city you control is collapsing into hell.
[03:17.600 --> 03:21.600]  Everyone is running from the Democrats and their meddling.
[03:21.600 --> 03:28.600]  Your so-called power card, the Democratic Party that found it, the KKK is going down.
[03:28.600 --> 03:41.600]  The Democrats are KKK. The Democrats are KKK.
[03:41.600 --> 03:48.600]  And look, they hope to bring the climate to KKK. Down with the KKK. Down with the children this way.
[03:48.600 --> 03:56.600]  Down with the KKK. And she said, no? Down with the KKK and Hillary. Down with the KKK and Hillary.
[03:56.600 --> 04:02.600]  Down with the Democrats and found it in the KKK. Down with the Democrats which has been found in the KKK.
[04:02.600 --> 04:18.600]  Down with the Democrats which has been found in the KKK. Down with the Democrats is found in the KKK.
[04:18.600 --> 04:28.060]  existence stands in the way of the globalist. Our very existence, our love of God, is the
[04:28.060 --> 04:36.100]  oxygen through which the universe and freedom thrives. Consciousness, my friends, the globalists
[04:36.100 --> 04:40.940]  are seeking to rob us of it, but we will not allow them to do that. We are the light in
[04:40.940 --> 04:46.740]  the dark of the night. Their artificial system is destined to fail and is failing. When we
[04:46.740 --> 04:52.640]  come back on this live Friday transmission, Fiona Hill committed massive perjury in Congress
[04:52.640 --> 04:57.600]  and we have her by his shorthairs. Stay with us, we'll be back.
[04:57.600 --> 05:06.740]  Beto Roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic
[05:06.740 --> 05:12.160]  rifles and he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said
[05:12.160 --> 05:17.220]  that he was a hero. Think about that. Now, those Democrats have taken all the guns in
[05:17.220 --> 05:23.500]  the cities they control. Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles
[05:23.500 --> 05:29.100]  and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime. They know what they're
[05:29.100 --> 05:34.660]  doing and now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued
[05:34.660 --> 05:39.860]  into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms. My goodness, ladies and gentlemen,
[05:39.860 --> 05:45.060]  those countries under such incredible attack, but more and more towns and cities are saying
[05:45.060 --> 05:48.860]  they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment and they're going to follow the original Bill
[05:48.860 --> 05:53.260]  of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[05:53.260 --> 05:58.260]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens. Well, we can ignore all your unconstitutional
[05:58.260 --> 06:24.260]  laws.
[06:24.260 --> 06:35.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, November 22nd, 2019, only 346 days left for the 2020
[06:35.460 --> 06:44.700]  elections. No amount of beautiful Italian, Western, the bad and the ugly music can even
[06:44.700 --> 06:51.260]  give it the epicness of where we are on this planet today, but it does a pretty good job
[06:51.260 --> 06:59.620]  of attempting it. But the majesty of reality is even greater than the best art humans have
[06:59.620 --> 07:07.940]  to offer. Ladies and gentlemen, this is quite a broadcast today. The illustrative pieces
[07:07.940 --> 07:26.460]  of information we have are like planets aligning. Fiona Hill, also known as Filbert Hill and
[07:26.460 --> 07:38.660]  also known as the villain in the Shrek franchise. I'm having a little fun here on this Friday
[07:38.660 --> 07:41.980]  for the media that's going to fact check that I'm not saying she's actually the character
[07:41.980 --> 07:46.180]  from Shrek that that's called a joke. They know fact check jokes, but everything else
[07:46.180 --> 07:50.300]  I'm going to cover from that point on. No, I don't believe that she's a tranny like Michelle
[07:50.300 --> 08:05.180]  Obama. No, I don't believe that Filbert Hill is a character from Shrek. But what she is
[08:05.180 --> 08:16.660]  is a liar that perjured herself and her Joan of Arc haircut to the entire world yesterday
[08:16.660 --> 08:27.620]  while she was lying about me and you, the American people. Oh, and I forgot somebody.
[08:27.620 --> 08:33.420]  I forgot somebody from these arrogant sniveling bureaucrat class paid for and put in power
[08:33.420 --> 08:43.580]  by Soros, another globalist. She's lying about poor Roger Stone who's done nothing to get
[08:43.580 --> 08:48.700]  Trump elected. Nothing wrong. Only good on that front on that account. I'm sure he's
[08:48.700 --> 09:00.260]  done bad his life. We all have. He's facing 20 to 50 years. That's the range at 67 years
[09:00.260 --> 09:07.420]  old for telling Congress that he did not talk directly to Julian Assange. And then he told
[09:07.420 --> 09:11.780]  crowds of people. He's trying to talk through intermediaries. I've talked to people that
[09:11.780 --> 09:16.740]  are talking to Assange and we're in contact with WikiLeaks. Well, I guess I was sending
[09:16.740 --> 09:22.140]  emails. They were ignoring to, I guess that's contact. But I'm not rehashing Roger Stone
[09:22.140 --> 09:27.300]  here. I'm simply pointing out that he can't respond to her and I can respond for Roger.
[09:27.300 --> 09:33.860]  So I will. They're trying to silence me. As you know, when she gets up there and she lies
[09:33.860 --> 09:42.980]  and says that Roger Stone and I concocted a criminal lie, they say we're criminals. Wait,
[09:42.980 --> 09:49.220]  I'm going to play the clip from the impeachment hearings yesterday and make up that she's
[09:49.220 --> 09:59.020]  a globalist, that she's a leftist and that she's worked for George Soros. Now I'm going
[09:59.020 --> 10:05.300]  to play the clip and then I'm going to show you evidence that is as plain as the nose on
[10:05.300 --> 10:09.060]  my face. And it's just a new thing they're doing where they hide things in plain view.
[10:09.060 --> 10:15.060]  In fact, let's just, let me just show you this first. It's right over here in my folder.
[10:15.060 --> 10:19.660]  But if you type in Fiona Hill Globalist into a search engine, I'm sure when Google sees
[10:19.660 --> 10:24.340]  this, they'll change it and bury it. There's a globalist think tank publication that she
[10:24.340 --> 10:31.740]  gets paid to work for. She's a senior writer called, wait for it, the globalist. It'd be
[10:31.740 --> 10:37.420]  like if they said, yes, they're claiming my name is Alexander Emrick Jones and it's
[10:37.420 --> 10:42.860]  preposterous lies. My name is Alexander Emrick Jones. You know, but you just said your name's
[10:42.860 --> 10:50.420]  the exact same thing. Well, no, actually, that's anti-semitics. I don't question me.
[10:50.420 --> 10:58.620]  You know, I didn't even know that the wimpy, goofy, imperious, arrogant, snarky, Lieutenant
[10:58.620 --> 11:03.020]  Colonel that said, I am Lieutenant Colonel Vettemann, do you? You will address me in
[11:03.020 --> 11:11.140]  my royal title. How in America? Not dangerous. We're not North Korea. We don't act like
[11:11.140 --> 11:15.900]  that towards the military. They work for us. We honor our military, our sons and daughters.
[11:15.900 --> 11:19.180]  I didn't know he was Jewish. I don't, when I think his word sorrows, I think Nazi collaborator
[11:19.180 --> 11:24.220]  globalist criminal. I don't think Jewish. I mean, the guy's an atheist. His emails came
[11:24.220 --> 11:33.180]  out as he believed Israel should exist. But again, it doesn't matter that both my grandfathers
[11:33.180 --> 11:39.620]  almost died fighting who sorrows work for. By alchemy, I am now the Nazi. So is Stephen
[11:39.620 --> 11:44.860]  Miller. So is Michelle Malcolm. She's got five hundred jobs as a Nazi. She's married to a
[11:44.860 --> 11:48.380]  Jew in pro-Israel. You know, like, that doesn't make sense. Well, I mean, saying I work, I'm
[11:48.380 --> 11:53.780]  a senior writer and I'm paid to work at the globalist publication that is a think tank
[11:53.780 --> 11:57.820]  dedicated to global governance. Go to their website. She's dedicated to global governance
[11:57.820 --> 12:05.820]  and world government and is trying to strategize about how to manage global government. She
[12:05.820 --> 12:09.700]  left the Brookings Institute, the National Security Council, head that up. She's also
[12:09.700 --> 12:15.620]  was a founding member when they renamed the Open Society Foundation and directed it for
[12:15.620 --> 12:20.740]  George Soros in the restructuring. That's on her Wikipedia, by the way, with entries
[12:20.740 --> 12:26.820]  by the State Department for it. So her people say she helped reorganize George Soros's main
[12:26.820 --> 12:33.100]  global foundation that controls it all. And she heads up as a major writer, the globalist.
[12:33.100 --> 12:43.220]  You can go there right now. And now she's all up there on TV. Well, we're going to play
[12:43.220 --> 12:50.340]  it when you come back from break. She's up there and she's got her hair cut now to look
[12:50.340 --> 12:58.180]  like Prince Valiant or the bad guy from Trek. And she's up there in her fancy pants, English
[12:58.180 --> 13:03.860]  accent, so we have to listen to that because it adds at least 5,000 IQ points. The IQ
[13:03.860 --> 13:11.700]  isn't 70 anymore, reading off a script. No, no, it's 5,000 and 70. Oh, and then she explains
[13:11.700 --> 13:19.060]  to us about the anti-Semite Alex Jones and the preposterousness that she works with Soros
[13:19.060 --> 13:26.940]  and even preposterous. He only headed up the reorganization of his main open society foundation
[13:26.940 --> 13:34.580]  that runs hundreds of subgroups and major foreign ministries across the planet as well
[13:34.580 --> 13:43.260]  as the state department and the attaché. Well, she gets up there, sworn under Earth and says
[13:43.260 --> 13:48.980]  to George Soros, I've never heard of him, even though we have video and photos of him
[13:48.980 --> 13:54.940]  with him, chairing events. She doesn't just work for George Soros, he didn't just pluck
[13:54.940 --> 14:00.340]  her out of college and bring her to America to show us Americans how to get with the globalist
[14:00.340 --> 14:06.020]  program, he isn't just a senior writer at theglobalist.com, teaching us about our world
[14:06.020 --> 14:12.820]  government. She gets up there in front of Congress and announces George Soros's will.
[14:12.820 --> 14:20.860]  Oh, the Alex Jones, Roger Stone, criminals arrest him and his semi, they have made up
[14:20.860 --> 14:26.300]  an imagination with George Soros once world government that she works with him, that they're
[14:26.300 --> 14:31.540]  undermining Trump, it's preposterous. They're all just bragging how they're going to have
[14:31.540 --> 14:37.740]  a coup and remove him. And when the lawyer for the fake whistleblower isn't praising
[14:37.740 --> 14:44.260]  pedophiles, you know, they're busy beavering away to get rid of off free speech. I mean,
[14:44.260 --> 14:48.460]  she's committed a major, oh, sorry, I shouldn't talk like a Texan. I think I'm back. Oh, yes,
[14:48.460 --> 14:56.220]  I'm smarter now. She has committed a great crime in front of Congress, lying openly
[14:56.220 --> 15:02.460]  a thousand times the supposed bending if you believe the worst scenario of stone to make
[15:02.460 --> 15:08.140]  it look like he might be able to speak to Assange's toenail occasionally when the moon
[15:08.140 --> 15:17.220]  is in proper gesticulation. Oh, I'm singing, I'm so smart. But seriously, the massive crime,
[15:17.220 --> 15:23.740]  oh, she committed a massive crime. Literally, she could have squatted and pissed on the Constitution
[15:23.740 --> 15:30.940]  on the table. And she's talking about Roger Stone, the criminal, while she's committing
[15:30.940 --> 15:35.620]  a real perjury in front of everybody, just like Joe Biden, committed a big crime. I told
[15:35.620 --> 15:39.180]  that son of a bitch, you fire him in a couple hours, you don't get the billion bucks, they
[15:39.180 --> 15:45.220]  fired that piece of garbage at the CFR. You got these mergers, right where we want them.
[15:45.220 --> 15:51.580]  So when we come back, we're going to show you this lion stinking Soros warts operations.
[15:51.580 --> 15:58.940]  I want her ass indicted. I want, I want her indicted for perjury today. Indite that whore.
[15:58.940 --> 16:03.580]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[16:03.580 --> 16:08.140]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating
[16:08.140 --> 16:11.900]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of

[17:01.220 --> 17:06.540]  too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like
[17:06.540 --> 17:12.140]  you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost
[17:12.140 --> 17:18.580]  ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed
[17:18.580 --> 17:23.340]  me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it
[17:23.340 --> 17:29.140]  alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors. They'll immerse you into a 30 day

[17:53.860 --> 18:04.900]  that's 800-506-6740. About a month ago, President Trump announced
[18:04.900 --> 18:10.260]  that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida, where he's always
[18:10.260 --> 18:16.660]  said he planned to retire to. And the left got so excited. They said, oh, he's about
[18:16.660 --> 18:23.380]  to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida. Well, now we
[18:23.380 --> 18:28.020]  know why the president did that. He knew the leftist-controlled appeals courts were going
[18:28.020 --> 18:32.800]  to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every
[18:32.800 --> 18:39.780]  business partner he's got. They want to terrorize people that he's worked with. And by moving
[18:39.780 --> 18:44.780]  his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to
[18:44.780 --> 18:50.940]  get his tax returns that are supposed to be private. So all those people out there holding
[18:50.940 --> 18:56.780]  their breath for the president to resign, in his words, we're kicking the deep state's
[18:56.780 --> 19:04.460]  ass and he's never going to resign. The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[19:04.460 --> 19:10.460]  I've said it many times, I will never give in. I will never give up, but I could give
[19:10.460 --> 19:17.260]  out. And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity,
[19:17.260 --> 19:23.140]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been
[19:23.140 --> 19:29.100]  silenced in cyberspace, that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[19:29.100 --> 19:36.140]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have
[19:36.140 --> 19:42.420]  by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and band.video. And that people
[19:42.420 --> 19:46.860]  are hungry for the truth now more than ever. And that if you tell people, hey, the banned
[19:46.860 --> 19:52.700]  truth they don't want you to have is at infowords.com forward slash show and band.video.
[19:52.700 --> 19:56.740]  So take heart, folks, they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down because
[19:56.740 --> 20:03.580]  the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[20:03.580 --> 20:31.580]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:31.580 --> 20:43.660]  It's Friday, November 22, 2019. Just 346 days left of the election. I'm Alex Jones, your
[20:43.660 --> 20:51.580]  host newswords.com and infowords.com are the places that Fiona Hill and other deep state
[20:51.580 --> 20:55.540]  rogue government operatives that believe they own and run this country and who brag that
[20:55.540 --> 20:59.780]  they're the deep state and don't care who you elect, they're going to keep running stuff.
[20:59.780 --> 21:04.300]  They say they want us taken off the air. They want us arrested. And they've been doing it.
[21:04.300 --> 21:07.740]  So we're going to go to that here in just a moment. But there she is on her think tank
[21:07.740 --> 21:14.180]  website, The Globalist, telling you how she wants world government, works for George Soros.
[21:14.180 --> 21:18.440]  And we're going to do something really, really important here, her testimony, her incredible
[21:18.440 --> 21:23.380]  perjury here in a moment. But she goes in this whole scripted deal because they already
[21:23.380 --> 21:29.300]  had multiple show trial hearings in secret over the last month. And so now they have
[21:29.300 --> 21:32.220]  these. So she's done this for the same people over and over again. They just add little
[21:32.220 --> 21:39.780]  pieces to it as they go. And he goes, tell me, is this anti-Semitism, speaking out against
[21:39.780 --> 21:45.300]  world government and saying you've ever worked for Soros? And she says, it's funny. I was
[21:45.300 --> 21:52.500]  just thinking that incredible script this or anything. Everything she says is a lie.
[21:52.500 --> 22:01.220]  Yes, it's Nazis running at all. It's the learned elders of Zion. The main funder, other than
[22:01.220 --> 22:06.660]  Soros or the foundation she works at, Brookings, and even Soros's foundation that she headed
[22:06.660 --> 22:11.500]  up a major division of, we're going to show you here from her own bio. I imagine it's
[22:11.500 --> 22:18.220]  on your own bio. It's like Alex Jones. They say you better talk to a host 25 years. That's
[22:18.220 --> 22:24.540]  insane. I've never had a show. We're like, but you've publicly had one. Nope. Nope. Haven't
[22:24.540 --> 22:29.460]  had it. It's like South Dakota. Meth, we're on it. They're like, that sounds like you're
[22:29.460 --> 22:35.540]  saying you're on meth. No, no, it doesn't. By the way, CBS News is saying they're not
[22:35.540 --> 22:39.900]  saying they're teaching children how to masturbate, which is pedophilic. It's other adults that
[22:39.900 --> 22:44.180]  aren't parents showing their child a masturbate. I mean, the hell, parents doing that. It's
[22:44.180 --> 22:48.340]  pedophilic pervert behavior. They'll figure it out for themselves. But again, it's just
[22:48.340 --> 22:52.060]  like we're going to in school, touch your children's genitals, actually reach down and
[22:52.060 --> 22:58.300]  help them like Jocelyn elders said back in the mid 1990s, sounded cookie them, but it's
[22:58.300 --> 23:03.700]  always been the agenda for them to put their hands on the little peepies and we wish the
[23:03.700 --> 23:08.980]  boys and girls, because that's who these folks are. Anyways, let me just get back to this.
[23:08.980 --> 23:14.340]  Fiona Hill has worked with the Brookings Institution, which takes massive amounts of money from
[23:14.340 --> 23:19.340]  the Ford Foundation, funded by Henry Ford. Henry Ford printed and disseminated 500,000
[23:19.340 --> 23:25.540]  copies of the protocol, the elders of Zion in the 1920s and on. It's not just hypocritical
[23:25.540 --> 23:33.740]  as Rashim Kosham says of human events, smart guy, because we aren't anti-Jew. It has nothing
[23:33.740 --> 23:39.980]  to do with Jews. If we say vitamins a liar and Soros is evil, but they just put that
[23:39.980 --> 23:44.820]  out there. And you hear the congressman when he brings this up, he's just dripping with
[23:44.820 --> 23:48.860]  enjoyment like he's going to release some secret mega weapon that no one's ever heard
[23:48.860 --> 23:54.500]  of racist. She's a globalist. She's a Soros mole. And if we start taking them out of the
[23:54.500 --> 23:58.820]  State Department, out of the government, about half of them are they brag. They are Soros
[23:58.820 --> 24:03.620]  brags. He helped overthrow Ukraine a few years ago with his moles in the State Department.
[24:03.620 --> 24:06.900]  This pair of money is in funnel to all these think tanks and groups out of the State Department.
[24:06.900 --> 24:11.020]  They're making money off of it and building world government for corporate interest in
[24:11.020 --> 24:19.780]  the chai comms. See how that works? See how they operate? So let's go to the congressional
[24:19.780 --> 24:26.780]  snippet of her and this particular congressman when they're going through all of this and
[24:26.780 --> 24:31.100]  she's perjuring herself to the world. Here is the hearings yesterday.
[24:31.100 --> 24:35.300]  Thank you so much for coming in and thank you for your service. Dr. Hill, you stated
[24:35.300 --> 24:40.180]  in your deposition you've been accused of being a mole for George Soros in the White
[24:40.180 --> 24:50.660]  House, correct? That's correct. You said in your deposition, specifically, a conspiracy
[24:50.660 --> 24:57.300]  was launched against you by convicted felon Roger Stone on the show Info Wars led by
[24:57.300 --> 25:01.540]  Alex Jones, right? I don't think it was a convicted felon at the time that he launched
[25:01.540 --> 25:06.460]  this, so I didn't use those exact words. But it was indeed Roger Stone and Alex Jones
[25:06.460 --> 25:14.700]  on Info Wars in 2017. And in fact, just more recently, before Mr. Stone was endured his
[25:14.700 --> 25:20.460]  trial, they were at it again, reprising the same Info Wars video and adding embellishments.
[25:20.460 --> 25:27.460]  And they said, I'll quote what they said about you. We here at Info Wars, this is Roger
[25:27.460 --> 25:34.660]  Stone speaking, first identified Fiona Hill, the globalist leftist George Soros Insider
[25:34.660 --> 25:41.260]  who had infiltrated McMaster's staff. He said that on May 31st, 2017. I presume you're
[25:41.260 --> 25:45.860]  not a globalist leftist Soros Insider, correct? I think my coal mining family would be very
[25:45.860 --> 25:49.740]  surprised to hear all of these things about me. I agree. Actually, leftist, perhaps not
[25:49.740 --> 25:53.460]  so much, but you know, anyway, the left in Europe is a bit different from the left here.
[25:53.460 --> 25:59.980]  Let's put it that way. I agree. Alright, hit pause. So she's up there saying, and it goes
[25:59.980 --> 26:10.380]  on, not a globalist. Nothing to do with Soros. It's all made up by these criminals. And they
[26:10.380 --> 26:16.860]  just go on and on and on when she is a chief operative and headed up his most powerful
[26:16.860 --> 26:23.900]  foundation, a major directorate. It's it's like saying Joseph Goebbels wasn't a Nazi
[26:23.900 --> 26:29.580]  or Babe Ruth wasn't a Yankee or Roger Stalback wasn't a Dallas cowboy or Ronald Reagan wasn't
[26:29.580 --> 26:37.740]  a Republican or towards Washington wasn't an American. Oh, other embellishments like
[26:37.740 --> 26:45.220]  your own bio. Other embellishments that you came in there and McMaster shot his mouth off
[26:45.220 --> 26:48.580]  and Soros had all the intel and packed the White House with Soros operatives and we exposed
[26:48.580 --> 26:52.980]  it. So we got demonized and sued and attacked because we're loyal Americans and we're not
[26:52.980 --> 26:57.460]  going to live under you dirty arrogant bureaucrats like vitamin. It's kind of vitamin to you
[26:57.460 --> 27:02.580]  lieutenant con lineman control. These people couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper
[27:02.580 --> 27:06.220]  bag and they've been in power. They took it over by secret. It's illegal. They weren't
[27:06.220 --> 27:10.460]  elected. And now they know you're awake. And now they know you're aware of what's going
[27:10.460 --> 27:13.500]  on in their scare. We're gonna come back and play the rest of it because this isn't about
[27:13.500 --> 27:18.900]  Alex Jones. It's bigger than Roger Stone. It's about the permanent bureaucracy that
[27:18.900 --> 27:22.820]  hates America that's selling us out to foreign interest. It'd be one thing to have a permanent
[27:22.820 --> 27:27.260]  bureaucracy that made some money on the side. That's bad because it leads to this totally
[27:27.260 --> 27:32.540]  corrupt bureaucracy that is selling us off and has disdained for us and its religion
[27:32.540 --> 27:39.540]  is America was never great. It'll never be great. Borders shouldn't exist. The family's
[27:39.540 --> 27:44.460]  bad. And about half of them are pedophiles. And you're seeing that now like this lawyer
[27:44.460 --> 27:48.140]  says he likes kids and that lawyer wants kids and this person's getting busted and that
[27:48.140 --> 27:55.620]  person and why is always Egyptian temples and because they're they're they're we playing
[27:55.620 --> 28:00.660]  sex magic garbage folks. It's it's it's all that stuff is. Alshar Crowley resurrected
[28:00.660 --> 28:05.820]  a bunch of Egyptian sex magic and they get a lot of people into it to have orgies and
[28:05.820 --> 28:10.300]  then it gets just worse from there. OK. So that's all it is. You're like why are they
[28:10.300 --> 28:14.540]  devil worshipers because it's the club. It's the induction. And when you take drugs and
[28:14.540 --> 28:19.420]  have orgies and stuff and then screw little kids and then kill little kids and stuff you'll
[28:19.420 --> 28:23.100]  do anything you're told and you'll get so whacked out. Ladies and gentlemen you'll do
[28:23.100 --> 28:29.140]  anything from there. It's mind control. We call intelligence agencies intelligence agencies
[28:29.140 --> 28:34.740]  they came out of secret societies and you think of modern mind control it all the best
[28:34.740 --> 28:38.620]  stuff is just ancient torture and ancient satanism because it was designed for that.
[28:38.620 --> 28:42.860]  If you can get people to rape and strangle and cut little kids off heads off while they
[28:42.860 --> 28:50.380]  beg for mommy you'll do anything. These people are a bunch of devil worshipping trash and
[28:50.380 --> 28:55.860]  the world's waking up to that. We have a satanic pedophile cult setting up a world government.
[28:55.860 --> 28:57.340]  Stay with us. We're going to stop it.
[28:57.340 --> 29:05.380]  Hello patriots. My name is Todd Savage founder of black rifle real estate dot com. Like you

[30:00.700 --> 30:06.780]  Major report out of major university researchers working on food based treatment to slow aging
[30:06.780 --> 30:12.140]  science daily probiotics in the gut of a particular type cause your entire body to be healthier
[30:12.140 --> 30:15.860]  and make you live longer and make you not get intestinal cancer. We have the very best

[30:28.060 --> 30:34.100]  made in the lower intestine. Oh and what does it say it's fiber from a spectrum of certain
[30:34.100 --> 30:39.940]  types of berries that grows this and yes this is a plug gut fusion and what do we have in
[30:39.940 --> 30:47.380]  this high auric berry blend strawberry blueberry blackberry cranberry escobalio grape and pomegranate.
[30:47.380 --> 30:53.140]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this gut fusion for children for young people for
[30:53.140 --> 30:56.980]  old people for everybody. This is fiber and glutamine. You're not going to find a better
[30:56.980 --> 31:02.540]  formula gut fusion. It's amazing info or store dot com info or store dot com. We have a new
[31:02.540 --> 31:07.060]  product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few
[31:07.060 --> 31:10.460]  days at the rate we're selling them want to thank the listeners for getting it but this
[31:10.460 --> 31:16.940]  really is a game changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four
[31:16.940 --> 31:21.820]  to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free the adult or the children's
[31:21.820 --> 31:26.420]  these are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers people love it. This
[31:26.420 --> 31:32.020]  is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans
[31:32.020 --> 31:38.460]  but also re mineralizes the teeth. Then it has the patented silver salt silver in it
[31:38.460 --> 31:42.180]  to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis. This is all proven you can make claims with
[31:42.180 --> 31:48.220]  us but I have to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the
[31:48.220 --> 31:54.700]  viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel. So
[31:54.700 --> 31:58.860]  we're really proud of it. It funds the operation info or store dot com. That's why we're still
[31:58.860 --> 32:05.820]  on air thanks to you. I've made a lot of predictions that have come true but I'm here to tell you
[32:05.820 --> 32:11.260]  that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball. I could
[32:11.260 --> 32:16.140]  see where the globalists were going. I could see what their in game agenda was what their
[32:16.140 --> 32:21.980]  goal was. And I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really
[32:21.980 --> 32:29.460]  setting the precedent to take everybody off air to silence everyone to ban words and names
[32:29.460 --> 32:35.300]  and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[32:35.300 --> 32:41.900]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future. It was the
[32:41.900 --> 32:48.020]  model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need
[32:48.020 --> 32:53.020]  total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed
[32:53.020 --> 32:57.700]  and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than
[32:57.700 --> 33:22.940]  ever. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Defending the republic from enemies or domestic
[33:22.940 --> 33:29.940]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:52.940 --> 34:03.140]  We're the real deal ladies and gentlemen all of us on this planet are sentient human beings
[34:03.140 --> 34:14.940]  living on this amazing planet hurtling through this incredible reality this universe. And
[34:14.940 --> 34:19.420]  the controllers are seeking and doing everything they can to keep us in the dark and to lie
[34:19.420 --> 34:27.180]  to us. We have a special report that Gregory's put together on Fiona Hill who I called a whore
[34:27.180 --> 34:34.940]  as we went to break segment four last and I want to apologize not to Fiona Hill but
[34:34.940 --> 34:39.820]  to prostitutes who are in a lot of cases you know good hardworking people I'm not really
[34:39.820 --> 34:43.660]  condoning what's going on I'm just saying there's a lot of people you know putting food on the
[34:43.660 --> 34:54.380]  table I'm in a globalist whore of Soros a trafficker any she's far worse than the worst
[34:54.380 --> 34:59.100]  street walker when it comes to selling this country out she whores herself out she whores
[34:59.100 --> 35:03.940]  the world out but she's not an American so what do you expect her system is about destroying
[35:03.940 --> 35:12.060]  nation states tearing cultures apart and putting it back together and people like Soros is
[35:12.060 --> 35:21.900]  in danger so only to this report but it's it's stunning that Roger Stone is convicted
[35:21.900 --> 35:30.700]  by a kangaroo court being railroaded by the swamp for telling Congress he'd not talk to
[35:30.700 --> 35:36.940]  Julian Assange Julian Assange would not give us the time of day would not give Roger the
[35:36.940 --> 35:42.780]  time of day but Roger was smart he called a bunch of journalists that were talking to
[35:42.780 --> 35:46.340]  him like everybody was doing he was going on a lot of shows then remember before we got
[35:46.340 --> 35:52.940]  barred from it helping defeat Hillary was the last straw they cut his media off remember
[35:52.940 --> 35:59.780]  few journalists could get in and write stuff down but no more live interviews and that's
[35:59.780 --> 36:04.780]  all public everybody knows exactly what happened this was all out in the open it isn't about
[36:04.780 --> 36:11.220]  Roger it's bigger than that and I just keep going back to that because she's up there
[36:11.220 --> 36:14.900]  and they're like they say you're a globalist they say you work with Soros yeah it's not
[36:14.900 --> 36:23.860]  true it's insane and then she works for a publication called the globalist and she's
[36:23.860 --> 36:32.580]  headed up one of his most if not most powerful foundation I mean it's all public it'd be
[36:32.580 --> 36:37.980]  like if they said if Obama was testifying former president Obama they say you're a
[36:37.980 --> 36:47.380]  reddish Democrat because that's absolutely ridiculous Obama they say they say your father
[36:47.380 --> 36:52.980]  was black he's like nope not true either my father was Russian thank you glad to clear
[36:52.980 --> 37:05.660]  that up for us on they say milk's white Obama nope it's purple we know that I was walking
[37:05.660 --> 37:09.740]  on a golf course near my house this morning you got stopped twice one by somebody walking
[37:09.740 --> 37:15.860]  another by a Greenskeeper name Robert hi Robert and he's like man I saw you on the impeachment
[37:15.860 --> 37:23.780]  page yesterday you know saying that lady works for Soros and he's all like wow he goes does
[37:23.780 --> 37:31.900]  she you're not lying are you I'm a listener I'm like no and I pulled my phone out I said
[37:31.900 --> 37:36.100]  watch this and I typed it to Google now that they're going to change it right now they're
[37:36.100 --> 37:39.660]  watching literally live down to just everything once people see it it's trending but you still
[37:39.660 --> 37:45.820]  find it on Bing or dog power start page you type in Fiona Hill globalist and you'll
[37:45.820 --> 37:50.100]  have all the publications now she's calling for it article she wrote global governance
[37:50.100 --> 37:53.940]  world government get rid of nations she writes for a publication called the globalist the
[37:53.940 --> 38:05.060]  guy goes well that's amazing I said I gotta go buddy but that little I talked to him showed
[38:05.060 --> 38:15.180]  him that everything in about a minute maybe 70 seconds I was looking at my watch 70 seconds
[38:15.180 --> 38:19.940]  and that guy basically had tears in his eyes he was just like because he was just saying
[38:19.940 --> 38:25.940]  that they're criminals I mean my god if you're watching on TV and I go this background today
[38:25.940 --> 38:33.900]  is not orange and the background is orange you're going but the background's orange well
[38:33.900 --> 38:38.660]  if you tell me that background's orange I'm going to call you an anti-Semite we're playing

[39:00.020 --> 39:07.380]  of it yet lie after lie after lie after lie and Roger Stone is convicted for saying I've

[39:19.660 --> 39:25.380]  to prison probably he has people calling for his death I walked down the street with him
[39:25.380 --> 39:28.260]  years ago here in Austin people say you're going to be an effing prison soon and you're
[39:28.260 --> 39:32.300]  going to get there too Jones when I go out to events Democrats go why aren't you an effing

[39:42.140 --> 39:46.900]  a Nazi and you know what we did to the Nazis right we dropped bombs on them and that's
[39:46.900 --> 39:50.420]  the little middle game so these people can act like crooks and they get into the whole
[39:50.420 --> 39:57.660]  anti-Semite thing if you criticize that weasel vitamin while you're anti-Semitic I didn't
[39:57.660 --> 40:01.660]  even know that it was a Jewish name but they're the ones bringing out the anti-Semitism making

[42:58.340 --> 43:05.780]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic
[43:05.780 --> 43:11.220]  rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said
[43:11.220 --> 43:16.620]  that he was a hero think about that now those democrats have taken all the guns in the cities
[43:16.620 --> 43:23.540]  they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive
[43:23.540 --> 43:29.500]  drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing and now
[43:29.500 --> 43:34.540]  the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[43:34.540 --> 43:39.260]  for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country
[43:39.260 --> 43:45.140]  is under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying their sanctuaries
[43:45.140 --> 43:48.660]  for the second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and
[43:48.660 --> 43:53.500]  constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot
[43:53.500 --> 43:57.300]  of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional
[43:57.300 --> 44:10.140]  laws a question was once posed to thomas jefferson what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant
[44:10.140 --> 44:16.180]  will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the limit
[44:16.180 --> 44:24.980]  to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is
[44:24.980 --> 44:33.060]  a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist
[44:33.060 --> 44:37.740]  or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people have
[44:37.740 --> 44:44.740]  all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what
[44:44.740 --> 44:49.820]  our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over
[44:49.820 --> 44:56.140]  us oxford's band clapping universities the us of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these
[44:56.140 --> 45:02.460]  people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them the globalists know that
[45:02.460 --> 45:09.140]  I will never willingly give up I've said it many times I will never give in I will never
[45:09.140 --> 45:15.540]  give up but I could give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all
[45:15.540 --> 45:22.100]  their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that
[45:22.100 --> 45:27.380]  most americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans have already
[45:27.380 --> 45:33.260]  been shadow banned by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't
[45:33.260 --> 45:40.500]  realize how much power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot com in fours
[45:40.500 --> 45:44.940]  dot com and banned on video and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever
[45:44.940 --> 45:49.860]  and then if you tell people hey the banned truth they don't want you to have is it info
[45:49.860 --> 45:54.860]  wars dot com forward slash show and banned on video so take heart folks they've had to
[45:54.860 --> 45:59.060]  censor everybody to show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat
[45:59.060 --> 46:05.980]  us fair and square there's a famous quote by marine court general in the korean war
[46:05.980 --> 46:12.260]  when three million chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the marines
[46:12.260 --> 46:17.940]  more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it but the point is they were outnumbered and the
[46:17.940 --> 46:25.100]  general was told general were completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all directions
[46:25.100 --> 46:31.300]  well that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is biblical
[46:31.300 --> 46:36.180]  and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support but it's going to become
[46:36.180 --> 46:42.940]  more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just americans
[46:42.940 --> 46:47.300]  but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speak in the name
[46:47.300 --> 46:54.340]  of a cia fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines
[46:54.340 --> 47:07.420]  because by info wars having its own platform that check makes the globalist you're listening
[47:07.420 --> 47:26.460]  to us we've got it waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[47:26.460 --> 47:37.020]  front lines of the info war we are back live broadcasting worldwide i'm your host alex
[47:37.020 --> 47:42.500]  jones your tv viewer i'd like to direct you to your screen radio listeners everybody else
[47:42.500 --> 47:48.660]  please go to info wars dot com a very important article written by paul joseph watson there
[47:48.660 --> 47:52.620]  it is from news wars great place to share it's from news wars that won't get censored
[47:52.620 --> 47:59.540]  as much you can get it out there fiona hill calls globalist description anti-semitic despite
[47:59.540 --> 48:03.780]  writing for media outlet called the globalist and being on the cfr the preeminent globalist
[48:03.780 --> 48:10.140]  organization worldwide and heading up the most powerful george soros a directorate as
[48:10.140 --> 48:17.980]  major foundation on global governance and open society you cannot make that up that's
[48:17.980 --> 48:22.500]  like saying a labrador retriever that's a black labrador retriever is not a black labrador
[48:22.500 --> 48:35.140]  retriever it's like saying that water isn't wet i mean it's it's just the most bona fide
[48:35.140 --> 48:41.180]  in your face lies and then we're all criminals and we're all anti-semitic and all this craziness
[48:41.180 --> 48:45.700]  that no one's thinking about jews when you talk about george soros only he knows about
[48:45.700 --> 48:52.580]  jews is killing him help round up jews i mean it's ridiculous or that that little vitamin
[48:52.580 --> 48:57.700]  creature is jewish i didn't even think of that doesn't even pick like an art typo you
[48:57.700 --> 49:03.220]  know anti-semitic probe about jews or something just looks looks like a child molester to
[49:03.220 --> 49:07.540]  me i mean i'm not saying he's a child molester i'm saying he looks i was a hollywood director
[49:07.540 --> 49:12.660]  and i was going to cast somebody i've cast him as a sniveling rat mole lying piece of
[49:12.660 --> 49:18.580]  crap like jew didn't pop into my head but don't worry they're going to tell you every
[49:18.580 --> 49:22.260]  time you don't want corruption or globalism or new world order somebody trying to teach
[49:22.260 --> 49:27.380]  your kids you know how to be how to be raped that's in the news cbs news teaching kids how
[49:27.380 --> 49:31.700]  to be abused by pedophiles now literally teaching them to let adults touch their genitals that's
[49:31.700 --> 49:38.260]  mainstream news i'm going to show you video on cbs as they cbs goes and tells elementary
[49:38.260 --> 49:43.780]  school students kindergartners how to play with their genitals they're coming for everything
[49:46.980 --> 49:51.700]  so they want total power they get their hands on your kids genitals you're going to put
[49:51.700 --> 49:55.940]  with anything else you want to put your hands on my kids i'm going to fight you you want to
[49:55.940 --> 50:01.620]  touch your genitals i'm going to kill you let's see they can teach you to just sit there and take
[50:01.620 --> 50:05.780]  it it's sheep training now we're going to come in and we're going to touch your daughter's genitals
[50:05.780 --> 50:11.380]  okay we're not a doctor we just want to touch them and teach them about sex okay you're liberal
[50:11.380 --> 50:15.540]  that's right i'm liberal don't let me call you any semenic oh yes oh don't call me that
[50:16.340 --> 50:22.900]  what does that have to do with any of it doesn't you know we fought hitler well you're him if if
[50:22.900 --> 50:34.260]  you don't bow to us okay so let's go to greg rees's report here it is um dr hill you stated
[50:34.260 --> 50:39.780]  in your deposition you've been accused of being a mole for george soros in the white house correct
[50:41.060 --> 50:47.140]  that's correct during their failing attempts to impeach the president for something democrat
[50:47.140 --> 50:54.660]  representative rajah krishna morty and fiona hill took an opportunity to claim that info wars
[50:54.660 --> 51:02.260]  and anyone else who criticizes george soros is anti-semitic but first they shared a strange
[51:02.260 --> 51:09.300]  moment of celebration for the conviction of roger stone you said in your deposition specifically
[51:10.900 --> 51:18.500]  a conspiracy was launched against you by convicted felon roger stone on the show info wars led by
[51:18.500 --> 51:23.140]  alex jones right i don't think it was a convicted felon at the time that he launched this so i
[51:23.140 --> 51:29.700]  didn't use those exact words after their little joke fiona hill brings up the time she was exposed
[51:29.700 --> 51:37.700]  on info wars in 2017 but it was indeed roger stone and alex jones on info wars in 2017 george soros
[51:37.700 --> 51:46.500]  has penetrated the trump white house soros has planted a mole infiltrating the national security
[51:46.500 --> 51:56.260]  apparatus a woman named fiona hill who has uh a harvard background has been on the soros payroll
[51:56.260 --> 52:02.180]  and the payroll of the open society institute fiona hill served as an advisory board member
[52:02.180 --> 52:10.740]  for the open societies institute an organization created by investor george soros but rather than
[52:10.740 --> 52:17.540]  address her soros affiliations hill called it a conspiracy theory and proudly defended the
[52:17.540 --> 52:24.660]  soros name interestingly um you stated in your deposition that a similar conspiracy theory
[52:24.660 --> 52:31.140]  had actually been launched against marie yovanovich um and you said specifically when i saw this
[52:31.140 --> 52:38.500]  happening to ambassador yovanovich again i was furious because this is again just this whipping
[52:38.500 --> 52:45.140]  up of what is frankly an anti-semitic conspiracy theory about george soros to basically target
[52:45.140 --> 52:51.460]  nonpartisan career officials isn't that what you said i did say that yes democrat witness alexander
[52:51.460 --> 52:57.140]  vindman was asked if his attitude towards the ukrainian government might have been influenced
[52:57.140 --> 53:03.780]  in some way by the fact that he was born in the ukraine without any reasonable explanation
[53:03.780 --> 53:10.980]  this was considered to be anti-semitic and racist and um i'm sure you've been watching uh with
[53:10.980 --> 53:17.060]  concern what's happened to other nonpartisan career officials we had alex lieutenant colonel alex
[53:17.060 --> 53:24.740]  vindman and an american immigrant questioned uh for his um uh criticism of the president
[53:25.700 --> 53:31.060]  in a very unfair way you know basically questioning his loyalty to the country i believe that he's
[53:31.060 --> 53:36.980]  also of ukrainian jewish descent would you say that these different theories these conspiracy
[53:36.980 --> 53:45.060]  theories that have been targeting you spun in part by folks like uh mr stone as well as um
[53:45.060 --> 53:53.460]  um uh fueled by rudy juliani and others um basically have a tinge of anti-semitism to them
[53:53.460 --> 53:58.580]  at least well certainly when they involve george soros they do well certainly when they involve
[53:58.580 --> 54:05.140]  george soros they do she then went on to bring up the protocols of the elders of zion a book the
[54:05.140 --> 54:12.900]  nazis used as propaganda against the jews and suggested that any criticism of george soros
[54:12.900 --> 54:19.540]  is the same um i just like to point out that in the early 1900s the zara secret police produced
[54:19.540 --> 54:23.780]  something called the protocols of the elders of zion which actually you can still obtain on the
[54:23.780 --> 54:28.740]  internet and you can buy it's actually sometimes in bookshops in russia and elsewhere this is the
[54:28.740 --> 54:36.580]  longest running anti-semitic trope that we have in history and the trope against uh mr soros george
[54:36.580 --> 54:42.900]  soros was also created for political purposes and this is the new protocols of the elders of zion
[54:43.540 --> 54:50.900]  my understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were uh is
[54:50.900 --> 54:56.740]  adopted god son yes yes went out in fact and helped in the confiscation of property from the jew
[54:56.740 --> 55:05.620]  that's right was it difficult not not at all no problem at all no feeling of guilt no it was
[55:05.620 --> 55:12.100]  actually probably the happiest year of my life that year of german occupation for me it's a very
[55:12.100 --> 55:22.340]  positive experience it's a very happy making exhilarating experience he gets to say on
[55:22.340 --> 55:26.820]  mpr and 60 minutes that it was really fun rounding up jews best time of his life
[55:26.820 --> 55:34.500]  when again i almost don't exist both my grandfather's almost died in world war two
[55:35.780 --> 55:41.140]  my grandfather's crew when he didn't go up two stories once he'd had burned retinas and couldn't
[55:41.140 --> 55:46.100]  go up the other time that strafe their base in north africa was early in the war and he was injured
[55:46.100 --> 55:50.020]  and then the other captain went on the plane blew up over idly we didn't know that till he died we
[55:50.020 --> 55:54.580]  dug through stuff he's like well i did some flying then i was a cook you know the army after that
[55:54.580 --> 55:59.300]  because you only flew your 21 missions or 22 missions and he did the 22 and was done and went
[55:59.300 --> 56:06.500]  into idly because at that time early in the war 55 percent of the planes never came back in many
[56:06.500 --> 56:11.460]  of the missions and on average you had as good a chance of dying doing 22 missions as you did
[56:11.460 --> 56:16.020]  of surviving 22 missions i mean it was just swarms of german planes at that point i mean you're
[56:16.020 --> 56:20.340]  talking to hundreds of messengers flying at those at those liberator planes and those b17s just
[56:20.340 --> 56:24.980]  hundreds hundreds coming at you it doesn't matter though because george soros helped round up jews
[56:24.980 --> 56:30.740]  so i gotta go oh i love you adl oh i love you i love you hollywood oh i love you i love you
[56:30.740 --> 56:34.980]  thank you george soros and your son is all over the internet at alistair krally rituals
[56:36.660 --> 56:41.700]  where they have the sacrifice people on tables behind them with daggers and he's just smiling
[56:41.700 --> 56:53.460]  going f u america oh please don't call me any semitic you devil worshippers oh i'm so scared of you
[56:53.460 --> 56:58.660]  finance your lawsuits finance your attacks do with everyone i don't care you're going to hell
[56:58.660 --> 57:06.820]  and everybody knows it unbelievable and it's just i haven't played all of it i mean they just
[57:06.820 --> 57:11.380]  attacked me they attacked stone they attacked him for wars they they just said we just made it all up

[58:56.340 --> 59:02.260]  really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists
[59:02.260 --> 59:08.420]  were going i could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they
[59:08.420 --> 59:13.860]  were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody
[59:14.500 --> 59:22.260]  off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[59:22.260 --> 59:27.940]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed what the globalists really feared was
[59:27.940 --> 59:34.260]  independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the
[59:34.260 --> 59:40.420]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[59:40.420 --> 59:45.220]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air
[59:45.220 --> 59:59.060]  is now more imperative and more vital than ever you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:59.060 --> 1:00:16.020]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:19.860]  all right i'm gonna open the phones up and we have several guests in third hour and i've got a ton
[1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:27.060]  of news we haven't even hit yet so much of it it's all coming up cbs news is promoting pedophilia
[1:00:27.060 --> 1:00:34.260]  now they themselves we've just got so much to go over and of course you've seen them in the fake
[1:00:34.980 --> 1:00:39.540]  kangaroo impeachment hearings with fiona hill all scripted saying she doesn't work with soros
[1:00:39.540 --> 1:00:44.660]  isn't a globalist this is next level perjury ladies and gentlemen but i want us to remember
[1:00:44.660 --> 1:00:51.940]  that according to their perjury scale this is an infinity and rogers at a point zero okay so let's
[1:00:51.940 --> 1:01:00.980]  go to that report for roger stone no i've addressed that before that is incorrect
[1:01:13.780 --> 1:01:17.140]  and as you can see there on the verdict sheet the jury was asked to consider
[1:01:17.140 --> 1:01:24.020]  seven felony counts against mr stone their decision on those counts was guilty guilty guilty guilty
[1:01:24.020 --> 1:01:30.900]  guilty guilty guilty and in some ways this verdict is sort of tempting to see it as yet another
[1:01:30.900 --> 1:01:36.180]  trump campaign figure going to prison or at least awaiting at least another one of them
[1:01:36.180 --> 1:01:40.500]  awaiting sentencing after being convicted or pleading guilty of felony charges i mean there's
[1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:46.340]  a lot of them now right the judge we've confirmed is allowed antifa operatives that's who works
[1:01:46.340 --> 1:01:52.100]  for soros to have wireless mics in the courtroom transmitting out
[1:01:54.340 --> 1:02:00.820]  they allow protesters against stone but no one who's pro stone on the grounds they gave power
[1:02:00.820 --> 1:02:05.220]  to right wingwatch that owns a big inflatable rat the courthouse plugged it in has it right
[1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:09.940]  there at the entrance there has never been a railroading like this and remember we exposed
[1:02:09.940 --> 1:02:16.020]  that there was a juror was a high level obama official we got the name right and her husband
[1:02:16.020 --> 1:02:20.180]  was on the meller probe when we exposed it they called for our arrest it was totally legal what
[1:02:20.180 --> 1:02:27.060]  we did but the judge removed her off of the jury but again they allowed people and roger would
[1:02:27.060 --> 1:02:32.420]  walk in every day to hold up lock him up signs and throw little plastic russian flags at him
[1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:38.180]  this is the show trial ladies and gentlemen and this is the model of what they want nationwide
[1:02:38.180 --> 1:02:43.060]  stone obstructed a congressional investigation into russian election interference because
[1:02:43.060 --> 1:02:48.340]  the truth would have looked bad for the president stone is now the sixth trump associate who's
[1:02:48.340 --> 1:02:52.820]  either pleaded guilty or been convicted in connection to the muller russia investigation
[1:02:52.820 --> 1:02:57.700]  the list includes trump's former campaign chairman paul maniford is former personal
[1:02:57.700 --> 1:03:01.380]  lawyer michael cohn and none of it for connections to russia running another friday night brian
[1:03:01.380 --> 1:03:05.940]  williams let's not forget the president's former national security advisor mike flinn remember this
[1:03:05.940 --> 1:03:11.060]  is brian williams who was on that jury cia operatives democrat party operatives people that
[1:03:11.060 --> 1:03:16.980]  work for clinton obama high level not just this one woman the first that it came out
[1:03:17.940 --> 1:03:22.180]  in that hearing was selected as the first juror the judge was telling everybody you
[1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:26.500]  don't talk about who these people are just like you don't talk about who the whistleblower is
[1:03:26.500 --> 1:03:31.060]  eric seramawa so that you wouldn't find out he was a political operative involved with
[1:03:31.060 --> 1:03:38.340]  honor biden and joe bite so that's where we are ladies and gentlemen this is the tyranny
[1:03:38.340 --> 1:03:43.060]  and this is a warm-up for president trump that gordon sonlin better sit up and take note of
[1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:49.460]  what happened today to roger stone on the witness tampering front and when he raises his right hand
[1:03:49.460 --> 1:03:54.580]  and he swears to congress to tell the truth he had better not play any games because you know
[1:03:54.580 --> 1:03:59.780]  when when you look at what has happened today alone on the witness tampering front you've got
[1:03:59.780 --> 1:04:05.700]  president trump sending out that tweet that the famatory threatening tweet to um ambassador
[1:04:05.700 --> 1:04:11.780]  yovanovich as your previous professor lauren sort of fits the bill
[1:04:13.780 --> 1:04:17.460]  president trump hasn't gotten the songs out of jail he could when he told us on to release the
[1:04:17.460 --> 1:04:22.980]  wiki leaks that's a big black mark on the president and if he doesn't pardon roger stone well then i
[1:04:22.980 --> 1:04:28.420]  mean i gotta tell you no matter how many good things trump does doing this to a song and letting
[1:04:28.420 --> 1:04:33.220]  stone hang out to dry if he does this i i just don't know what i'm gonna do we need to call the
[1:04:33.220 --> 1:04:42.980]  white house right now 202 456 1414 and tell president trump to pardon him don't let him get
[1:04:42.980 --> 1:04:47.140]  their hands on him they'll put him in solitary confinement god knows what they'll do to his food
[1:04:47.140 --> 1:04:53.940]  these people mean business and they mean to kill him we'll be back ladies and gentlemen stand for
[1:04:53.940 --> 1:05:02.580]  the first amendment stand for truth major report out of major university researchers working on

[1:08:02.820 --> 1:08:10.420]  info wars.com article trump takes off the gloves trump fingers the king daddy obama who's still
[1:08:10.420 --> 1:08:13.300]  running things against you behind the scenes that's why he skipped his head down hoping
[1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:17.060]  trump stupid and doesn't know that obama's even more powerful than hillary but they're both are
[1:08:17.060 --> 1:08:23.220]  still kind of co-heads of the democratic party warrants scandal went to the top they were spying
[1:08:23.220 --> 1:08:28.820]  on my campaign it went up to the top everybody knows it the knowledge that fbi official
[1:08:31.540 --> 1:08:37.300]  altered a document which led to the surveillance of the trump campaign went all the way to the top
[1:08:38.100 --> 1:08:42.900]  of the obama administration president trump said on friday in particular the document
[1:08:42.900 --> 1:08:49.140]  alteration led to the foreign intelligence surveillance act court granting a warrant to spy
[1:08:49.140 --> 1:08:54.660]  on campaign aid carter page they were spying on my campaign it went up to the top and everybody
[1:08:54.660 --> 1:09:00.820]  knows it and now we're going to find out trump said during an interview with fox and friends
[1:09:00.820 --> 1:09:06.900]  this was spying on my campaign something that has never been done before in the history of our
[1:09:06.900 --> 1:09:11.700]  country uh i disagree with that these agencies spy on everybody but just to try to help the
[1:09:11.700 --> 1:09:16.260]  globalist they're usually spying on whoever they want to win so they can ingratiate themselves
[1:09:16.260 --> 1:09:19.380]  and of course it came out of the cia it was illegally spying on republicans and democrats
[1:09:19.380 --> 1:09:24.340]  when there was oversight hearings uh a decade ago it's all illegal it's all out of control but it
[1:09:24.340 --> 1:09:28.820]  was intense it was the most intense in history and the most criminal because they lied to get the
[1:09:28.820 --> 1:09:33.940]  fake warrants to parallel construct the illegal investigation they were already doing that's the
[1:09:33.940 --> 1:09:41.460]  easiest crimes to convict on in fact it's open and shut that's why uh william benny two years ago
[1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:46.260]  calls up and he goes hey everybody's talking about wanting to see proof of the illegally spying
[1:09:46.820 --> 1:09:53.780]  it's in the inspector general's report on the fiza court issued by the inspector general of the courts
[1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:59.460]  and ended it said they were brought forward four fake warrants that the courts had looked back on
[1:09:59.460 --> 1:10:06.580]  so they told the executive and the head of the nsa went and warned trump when he was president
[1:10:06.580 --> 1:10:11.620]  elect remember at trump tower so that's what's going on here ladies and gentlemen
[1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:18.820]  and it's incredibly incredibly important you can see the video of the president
[1:10:20.020 --> 1:10:28.260]  breaking all that down the president implicating directly obama and the deep state illegally
[1:10:28.260 --> 1:10:32.820]  spying on his campaign and trying to overthrow that election that is a criminal action not just
[1:10:32.820 --> 1:10:37.940]  that violates federal law but violates every americans right to elect the president that's
[1:10:37.940 --> 1:10:42.580]  something they're trying to steal from you and put you into a bureaucratic dictatorship of this
[1:10:42.580 --> 1:10:48.900]  deep state for decades denying its existence now they're on national tv on c span thank god
[1:10:48.900 --> 1:10:53.140]  for the deep state that paul krugman at the new york times has come out and said oh thank god
[1:10:53.140 --> 1:10:57.220]  there's a deep state there that doesn't care who's in office and will do what's right meaning ignoring
[1:10:57.220 --> 1:11:04.820]  the will of the people in common sense and selling the nation out absolutely insane now i intend to
[1:11:04.820 --> 1:11:10.500]  give the number out i intend to take your calls on the impeachment hearing fiasco's on where the
[1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:15.700]  globalists are going on where all of this is unfolding the toll free number is 877889 alex
[1:11:15.700 --> 1:11:25.540]  8777892539 8777892539 and let's give first time callers a chance again today first time callers

[1:11:37.300 --> 1:11:44.580]  going to come back and get into the worst case of sexualization of children and open pedophile
[1:11:44.580 --> 1:11:50.260]  pushing we've seen so far when you understand why it's key and how it's the final bridge
[1:11:50.260 --> 1:11:57.060]  towards their in game goal getting their hands on your children's bodies their private parts
[1:11:57.060 --> 1:12:03.460]  that's the brass ring that's the prize that's the ruby in the head of the idol that's uh
[1:12:03.460 --> 1:12:12.100]  their vahala it's their jackpot it's what their heat seeking missiles coming right for your children
[1:12:13.060 --> 1:12:16.740]  and when you understand what makes them tick then everything makes sense oh devil worshipers
[1:12:16.740 --> 1:12:22.660]  oh pedophiles demons whether it's biological whether it's spiritual which is really just
[1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:28.980]  electrochemical transmissions it's just what a spirit is energetic see all the science is now
[1:12:28.980 --> 1:12:32.900]  merging with what everybody knew in ancient times they know how to quantify they just knew what it was
[1:12:32.900 --> 1:12:38.340]  and well now we know it's a giant alien invasion you know christians would call it demons and
[1:12:38.340 --> 1:12:41.300]  they're not very friendly they're not very nice because they're not an advanced species they're
[1:12:41.300 --> 1:12:46.180]  just very old and twisted and hateful and like to eat us and tear us up and destroy us and they
[1:12:46.180 --> 1:12:52.020]  can only do it through our bodies they're not in this dimension so and uh you know they're here
[1:12:52.020 --> 1:12:56.180]  and they're hunting your kids that's their favorite and you know i like veal so you know from their
[1:12:56.180 --> 1:13:00.980]  perspective people's that's mean to you know eat dead baby cows well they don't really feel much
[1:13:00.980 --> 1:13:04.660]  when they get that gas bolt slamming their brains out a lot of folks will get mad at me for that but
[1:13:04.660 --> 1:13:08.580]  i'm just being honest about it maybe if cows had consciousness as much as i do or stood up
[1:13:08.580 --> 1:13:12.740]  with themselves and weren't prey animals they'd be pissed that i eat their babies i don't have sex
[1:13:12.740 --> 1:13:19.220]  with them i'd be perverted but i i i eat baby cows well these things spiritually want to eat
[1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:23.700]  your children's souls it's the most delicious the freshest the newest for them and if they can
[1:13:23.700 --> 1:13:28.260]  terrorize them and enslave them they think they can try to trick them into joining evil is really
[1:13:28.260 --> 1:13:34.340]  one of the plans so they get that essence forever with them down in that spider hole you see so yeah
[1:13:34.340 --> 1:13:39.460]  it's kind of in a humane that i i'm trying to be more more of a person that has even more empathy
[1:13:39.460 --> 1:13:42.660]  because you can have empathy for a cow you're eating you're gonna have even more for humans i
[1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:48.260]  don't want to be callous i don't like herding animals i'm just telling you that i've abused a
[1:13:48.260 --> 1:13:54.580]  hell of a lot of cows eating them but i don't have a flavor for your children it's a flavor thing
[1:13:54.580 --> 1:14:01.780]  okay ladies and gentlemen well if you were wondering if the attorney general mr bar
[1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:06.580]  is a good guy hopefully we're gonna find out and see what's in the inspector general report and
[1:14:06.580 --> 1:14:11.540]  see if he's gonna take action he's done a lot of good things and he's talked about the deep state
[1:14:11.540 --> 1:14:17.300]  being criminal and he has spurred criminal investigations and admitted their criminal
[1:14:17.300 --> 1:14:20.980]  investigations and said the deep state is out of control and needs to be stopped rhetorically
[1:14:20.980 --> 1:14:27.060]  that's really good but i want to see action jackson but something like this this is not good

[1:18:04.180 --> 1:18:11.860]  3 million chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the marines more than 50 to 1 some
[1:18:11.860 --> 1:18:17.780]  estimates have it but the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general
[1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:24.020]  were completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all directions well that's the point
[1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:29.940]  that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone
[1:18:29.940 --> 1:18:37.940]  this far without all your support but it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship
[1:18:37.940 --> 1:18:42.500]  becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks all over the world are completely
[1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:48.900]  silenced when it comes to speaking the name of a cia fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[1:18:48.900 --> 1:18:54.820]  or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having its own platform
[1:18:54.820 --> 1:19:03.300]  that checkmates the globalist beto orc came out dozens of times and said we're going to
[1:19:03.300 --> 1:19:08.580]  confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage nine
[1:19:08.580 --> 1:19:14.740]  others to agree and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats have taken all the
[1:19:14.740 --> 1:19:21.780]  guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal craft poles covered with needles and
[1:19:21.780 --> 1:19:27.460]  with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing
[1:19:28.100 --> 1:19:33.460]  and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[1:19:33.460 --> 1:19:38.500]  for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's under
[1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:44.340]  such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the
[1:19:44.340 --> 1:19:48.580]  second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and constitution
[1:19:48.580 --> 1:19:53.380]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore
[1:19:53.380 --> 1:19:56.660]  illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws
[1:20:01.220 --> 1:20:03.860]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:03.860 --> 1:20:17.060]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show
[1:20:34.260 --> 1:20:42.980]  you some of them some of them want to get used by some of them some of them want to abuse you
[1:20:42.980 --> 1:20:51.540]  some of them some of them want to be abused but who's missing from this group some of them want
[1:20:51.540 --> 1:20:58.740]  to empower you and themselves and go beyond the stars some of them want to seek god's countenance
[1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:10.260]  and face some of them understand there's unlimited mystery and destiny and beauty
[1:21:11.780 --> 1:21:23.140]  and will and justice but before humans can ascend to the next level we have to be put through a test
[1:21:23.140 --> 1:21:34.740]  of what would we do with power would we be lazy would we be evil would we be controlling
[1:21:35.780 --> 1:21:42.900]  or would we be empowering would we be able to have justice would we be able to
[1:21:42.900 --> 1:21:55.460]  have discernment the eye has not seen the ear has not heard you think there's nothing new in
[1:21:55.460 --> 1:22:03.780]  the universe think again there's nothing new on this plane but different combinations of the same
[1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:13.220]  thing but right beyond this plane right beyond visual sight are the upper levels of this cathedral-like
[1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:22.020]  system that god's built but below this dimension is everything
[1:22:24.340 --> 1:22:31.860]  counterproductive to the justice and the logic and the will of the master creator
[1:22:31.860 --> 1:22:36.900]  you know they say in the masonic order and then people twist it and say they're saying that's the
[1:22:36.900 --> 1:22:40.660]  devil oh the devil says that it's the devil being a counterfeit which the devil does
[1:22:40.660 --> 1:22:47.220]  that god is known as the grand architect and that is what this is this is a grand architecture
[1:22:48.020 --> 1:22:55.860]  that continues to permeate throughout itself it is not a big bang a singular compaction of
[1:22:55.860 --> 1:23:05.780]  matter from nothing exploding out ever expanding into nothingness that is only one spark
[1:23:08.020 --> 1:23:13.700]  creating platforms through which third dimensional life could be arranged
[1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:22.740]  developed germinated and launched
[1:23:22.740 --> 1:23:30.820]  but from the jump points third dimension look at this beautiful jump point we were given all
[1:23:30.820 --> 1:23:36.740]  this amazing life and these incredible oceans and just all the beautiful heavens around us
[1:23:38.180 --> 1:23:41.620]  that's a happy little nest a beautiful little lily pad
[1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:48.740]  but there's a lot of stuff in this world very little beady
[1:23:48.740 --> 1:23:54.500]  larva swimming around in a raindrop on the lily pad
[1:23:59.380 --> 1:24:00.500]  and along comes
[1:24:03.940 --> 1:24:05.300]  on comes the parasite

[1:27:27.620 --> 1:27:36.740]  definition of evil is discordance it doesn't work it's it's it's it's it's this system can only
[1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:42.660]  infest something that's already good and built and then screw it up and deform it it never
[1:27:42.660 --> 1:27:47.300]  builds something better it can only tear something down and twist it and put an eyeball in the wrong

[1:28:17.300 --> 1:28:22.580]  that's why they have all these movies where you just see the most horrible stuff going on and then
[1:28:22.580 --> 1:28:28.340]  you find out later oh that's a real thing they did but then they'll turn around and say a patriot

[1:33:53.620 --> 1:33:59.780]  transmission and the article is up on info wars dot com with the sickening
[1:34:02.420 --> 1:34:08.180]  video and the sickening graphics and what the children are taught and the things they say to
[1:34:08.180 --> 1:34:15.940]  them but this is being done to elementary school students and cbs news is doing tv reports about
[1:34:15.940 --> 1:34:22.980]  how great it is and showing the teachers with elementary students teaching them how to play
[1:34:22.980 --> 1:34:28.020]  with themselves how girls do it and how boys do it now why is it such an evil satanic bridge
[1:34:29.460 --> 1:34:34.020]  a parents don't sit there and do this with children or they're called perverts when they do it
[1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:40.020]  but when the state does it they set the precedent to sexualize children and then once they've got it
[1:34:40.020 --> 1:34:45.380]  where they tell the children about it in areas of europe they actually touch them and stimulate them
[1:34:45.380 --> 1:34:53.620]  to show them that which is sexual assault but once that bridge is there well i'm just gonna
[1:34:54.900 --> 1:35:00.340]  zip my pants down and put it into the child to show them see how that works where i'm going
[1:35:00.340 --> 1:35:06.900]  to use this device and then they can add new things they say are normal sexual practices and your
[1:35:06.900 --> 1:35:13.940]  teachers can teach you how to have sex with an adult how to be raped and that's the books they
[1:35:13.940 --> 1:35:19.060]  have in middle schools and elementary now from australia the united states it's in the news
[1:35:19.060 --> 1:35:26.100]  where they teach children with so-called true stories which of course aren't really sick perverts
[1:35:26.100 --> 1:35:33.140]  about oh how they were eight years old or ten years old and how a man came to their backyard now they
[1:35:33.140 --> 1:35:42.260]  had sex with them in a garage things like that i i read this and i can't read this stuff on
[1:35:42.260 --> 1:35:46.260]  air it makes me too angry and i'm not going to look at it but this is literally trying to tell
[1:35:46.260 --> 1:35:51.620]  your children putting their head that if a creepy man comes up at the park or in the woods to go with
[1:35:51.620 --> 1:35:56.900]  them the kids will get killed a lot of times not just brutally abused so they're just priming the
[1:35:56.900 --> 1:36:04.340]  abuse just a few days ago all over colorado it's in the main curriculum selected approved curriculum
[1:36:04.340 --> 1:36:11.780]  poems about thousands of young girls being raped and semen pouring out of their vaginas folks this
[1:36:11.780 --> 1:36:17.140]  is this is this is not a show trying to be gross but this is happening to children this is happening
[1:36:17.140 --> 1:36:23.460]  to eighth graders and and women chained up and being beaten and how sexy it is and how the women
[1:36:23.460 --> 1:36:35.700]  love it and then they make them in their classes recited you're like this isn't real no it it is
[1:36:35.700 --> 1:36:48.580]  real and it is happening and remember the surgeon general remember jocelyn elders do you remember
[1:36:48.580 --> 1:37:09.780]  that remember what she did she got approved and started giving speeches and that weird voice of
[1:37:09.780 --> 1:37:19.620]  her on kindergartners you need to reach down and help the masturbate and really what happens
[1:37:20.500 --> 1:37:26.020]  when people are habituated to this and told to do it daily during the kindergarten rest time
[1:37:27.060 --> 1:37:33.380]  that when they become adults the most unproductive people and the most depressed people and the most
[1:37:33.380 --> 1:37:40.420]  alone people are masturbation addicts and there's a big movement of people trying to not masturbate
[1:37:40.420 --> 1:37:45.940]  i guess in the month of uh it's november or october it's november they're what they're called
[1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:51.860]  yeah no not november they've got another name the people that constantly do it and
[1:37:53.300 --> 1:37:57.220]  this is a medical issue and i'm being serious here and these people are totally depressed
[1:37:57.220 --> 1:38:04.260]  totally unproductive and i guess the average kind of video game had porn addict maybe up
[1:38:04.260 --> 1:38:11.460]  masturbating up to 20 times a day or even more some of them average more than that a day i mean
[1:38:11.460 --> 1:38:20.260]  i i just it sounds horrible doesn't it i mean i'm a married man i have no need of that like i've
[1:38:20.260 --> 1:38:24.340]  joked around uh my wife was a race car or she wouldn't be street legal it's just a lot of
[1:38:24.340 --> 1:38:29.140]  horsepower uh but seriously ladies and gentlemen
[1:38:33.780 --> 1:38:37.140]  and they try to couch it like oh we just don't want people to be hung up on things children
[1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:41.860]  aren't hung up on things children are the way god made them you perverts want a relationship
[1:38:41.860 --> 1:38:48.740]  with children and you want to touch their genitals and you want to have sex with them and that's all
[1:38:48.740 --> 1:38:54.900]  this is is incremental towards that and they're right up to where they want to be in this incremental
[1:38:54.900 --> 1:39:01.780]  march by these little baby steps they're right there right now and it's absolutely out of control

[1:42:48.180 --> 1:42:52.660]  are amazing and and you just need to find out by using them yourself and a lot of stuff that's
[1:42:52.660 --> 1:43:00.020]  been sold out just came back in like krill oil in boar store.com there's a famous quote by marine
[1:43:00.020 --> 1:43:06.260]  court general in the korean war when three million chai comms had flooded across the border and
[1:43:06.260 --> 1:43:13.780]  surrounded the marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it but the point is they were
[1:43:13.780 --> 1:43:19.700]  outnumbered and the general was told general were completely surrounded he said good we can attack
[1:43:19.700 --> 1:43:27.460]  in all directions well that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really
[1:43:27.460 --> 1:43:33.060]  is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support but it's going to become
[1:43:33.060 --> 1:43:40.340]  more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks all
[1:43:40.340 --> 1:43:45.860]  of the world are completely silenced when it comes to speak in the name of a cia fake whistleblower
[1:43:45.860 --> 1:43:52.580]  or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having
[1:43:52.580 --> 1:44:00.900]  its own platform that checkmates the globalist i've made a lot of predictions that have come
[1:44:00.900 --> 1:44:07.940]  true but i'm here to tell you most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball
[1:44:07.940 --> 1:44:13.220]  i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda was what their
[1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:18.980]  goal was and i knew that when they were setting a sub to bd platformed that they were really
[1:44:18.980 --> 1:44:27.140]  setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and
[1:44:27.140 --> 1:44:33.460]  information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed but the globalist
[1:44:33.460 --> 1:44:40.820]  really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as
[1:44:40.820 --> 1:44:46.500]  much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance
[1:44:46.500 --> 1:44:51.140]  for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info
[1:44:51.140 --> 1:45:02.740]  wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever beto roark came out dozens of times
[1:45:02.740 --> 1:45:07.700]  and said we're gonna confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles and he got all the other democrats
[1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:14.180]  on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats
[1:45:14.180 --> 1:45:19.700]  have taken all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes
[1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:26.820]  covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know
[1:45:26.820 --> 1:45:32.500]  what they're doing and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be
[1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:37.860]  sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen
[1:45:37.860 --> 1:45:43.540]  this country's under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying they're
[1:45:43.540 --> 1:45:47.780]  sanctuaries for the second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and
[1:45:47.780 --> 1:45:52.820]  constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these
[1:45:52.820 --> 1:46:00.660]  cities ignore illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws major report out of
[1:46:00.660 --> 1:46:05.940]  major university researchers working on food based treatment to slow aging science daily
[1:46:05.940 --> 1:46:11.140]  probiotics in the gut of a particular type cause your entire body to be healthier and make you live
[1:46:11.140 --> 1:46:15.540]  longer and make you not get intestinal cancer we have the very best formula literally with what

[1:46:58.260 --> 1:47:03.460]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:03.460 --> 1:47:29.700]  welcome back to the most demonized most lied about rug guests in the world by tyrants communist
[1:47:29.700 --> 1:47:40.740]  pedophiles devil wars versus sickos chai comms speaking of chai comms furious china shadows
[1:47:40.740 --> 1:47:45.860]  to us warships sailing through disputed waters warns them to leave big zero hedge dot com article
[1:47:45.860 --> 1:47:53.380]  on info wars dot com why is that so important well i went and looked at the navigation of those
[1:47:53.380 --> 1:48:01.620]  waters and china in maps from over a thousand years ago claimed the philippines japan though
[1:48:01.620 --> 1:48:06.100]  they were never able to capture japan had a bunch of wars with them they just claimed that whole
[1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:15.060]  area is theirs so uh it's ridiculous and they're basically in a war with vietnam that's what we're
[1:48:15.060 --> 1:48:24.580]  giving them ships now larger ships surface ships so things are really escalating and and we just
[1:48:24.580 --> 1:48:30.980]  kind of like frogs in the boiling water are watching this go up up up and now Henry Kissinger says
[1:48:30.980 --> 1:48:35.300]  that war with china is inevitable it'll be worse than world war two that's a quote last week that's
[1:48:35.300 --> 1:48:40.260]  barely a blip he's the main guy talking to china behind the scenes i mean this is serious business
[1:48:40.260 --> 1:48:46.420]  but we're busy hearing about how evil donald john trump is for the media and now he's hitler and all
[1:48:46.420 --> 1:48:54.740]  this crap it's just insane meanwhile john bolton teases coming back story in cryptic tweet that

[1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:05.780]  amid impeachment frenzy yeah it's not just the soros leftist globalists that are coming in against
[1:49:05.780 --> 1:49:10.580]  trump it's this guy we warned him about bolton i disagree with roger stone he's like well maybe
[1:49:10.580 --> 1:49:14.820]  bolton under trump won't sell him out maybe he'll stop in a neocon yeah leopards don't change their
[1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:22.420]  spots and this little chicken hawk uh certainly uh is he's gonna say oh there's a back story here
[1:49:22.420 --> 1:49:28.260]  and oh you know trump did mean to do all this and i refused because him and fiona hill laid out the
[1:49:28.260 --> 1:49:34.020]  breadcrumbs then and we're saying oh this will bring trump down look he's meddling he's quid pro quo
[1:49:34.020 --> 1:49:39.940]  he's doing all this so that everyone go oh he is yeah we all say that we all claim that we feel
[1:49:39.940 --> 1:49:44.020]  like that's what he said but he was smart enough to never do that even though real policy is quid
[1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:49.220]  pro quo hey you do this we're not gonna give you the money that's what foreign policy is he's buying
[1:49:49.220 --> 1:49:56.580]  these countries they just don't like the policy trumps trying to buy and so he knows they're
[1:49:56.580 --> 1:50:05.540]  trying to make normal foreign policy illegal now and so he's like ooh they're trying to paralyze
[1:50:05.540 --> 1:50:13.140]  the president the quid pro quo that's bad is if trump said build my hotel there tax-free and
[1:50:13.140 --> 1:50:18.820]  i'll give you the billion dollars i'd say arrest him i ever see proof of that not stuff from these
[1:50:18.820 --> 1:50:22.500]  liars i'll say impeach him right now throw him in prison but none of that's there is trump
[1:50:22.500 --> 1:50:28.980]  doesn't do business that way he wouldn't be where he's at today in this piranha world you better be
[1:50:28.980 --> 1:50:35.940]  above reproach hi the new york times calling me up uh the other day saying you're former employees
[1:50:35.940 --> 1:50:39.060]  says this isn't that and i went and asked people about the former employee and they said yeah no

[1:50:43.700 --> 1:50:47.860]  forgot about that and then he found out we were gonna have to let him go so he acted all disgruntled
[1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:53.220]  about trump and went over there and i was like man and we're just gonna wait and luckily we had
[1:50:53.220 --> 1:50:57.300]  some evidence of that so when that comes out in a week or so we can then expose it but i mean
[1:50:57.860 --> 1:51:03.940]  but we think he was in here now trying to set us up saying it to people on road trips and in
[1:51:03.940 --> 1:51:09.060]  person like trying to get us to go oh codeword and we'd say it but i mean i tell you it's just
[1:51:09.060 --> 1:51:14.980]  next level we had to let somebody else go because they were doing that and uh then it turned out
[1:51:14.980 --> 1:51:19.140]  they were working with the left as well and people said man you got to sue you got to sue it i'm
[1:51:19.140 --> 1:51:24.500]  like listen i'm fighting all these lawsuits i have sued the young turks and others but i just can't
[1:51:24.500 --> 1:51:30.740]  sue everybody but i i do think the fact lawyers are here today i'm we're meeting about suing people

[1:51:43.460 --> 1:51:47.540]  that protect the identity if somebody else figures this out or they start bearing witness in a court
[1:51:47.540 --> 1:51:52.580]  trial now they have to be public but people sign ndaas anywhere so that they don't release
[1:51:52.580 --> 1:51:56.740]  proprietary information it's not because we're hiding something and something evil is going on
[1:51:56.740 --> 1:52:02.820]  but i've noticed with ndaas ndaas people usually to claim there's something secret going on that
[1:52:02.820 --> 1:52:09.140]  isn't so either we're going to sue them for violating the nda or we're going to waive that and then
[1:52:09.140 --> 1:52:15.060]  bring out the personal stuff about them and i think the audience will think it's very interesting
[1:52:15.060 --> 1:52:19.380]  and very informative i mean i have all the witnesses all the people and in one case the write up
[1:52:20.900 --> 1:52:26.900]  for the one individual would come into meetings and and and start and then person was black
[1:52:27.860 --> 1:52:32.660]  and would say what's up my and people go hey whoa we don't talk like that and the first three or
[1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:36.180]  four times they didn't bring it up to a manager and later was brought up to me and i'm like well

[1:52:43.060 --> 1:52:47.780]  man that's not cool man but that's what the left does that's how they operate well we've got another
[1:52:47.780 --> 1:52:53.620]  person doing it it wasn't black but it's white and i'm just listen i've already sued five people
[1:52:53.620 --> 1:52:59.460]  last month i'm done gloves are off gloves are off and listeners are like hey we want to see

[1:58:01.940 --> 1:58:08.980]  all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most
[1:58:08.980 --> 1:58:15.060]  americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans have already been shadow banned
[1:58:15.060 --> 1:58:21.220]  by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much
[1:58:21.220 --> 1:58:27.860]  power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and band
[1:58:27.860 --> 1:58:32.500]  on video and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people
[1:58:32.500 --> 1:58:38.740]  hey the band truth they don't want you to have is it info wars dot com forward slash show and band on
[1:58:38.740 --> 1:58:43.780]  video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down because the
[1:58:43.780 --> 1:58:52.260]  truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square about a month ago president trump
[1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:58.180]  announced that he was going to move his domicile from new york city to florida where he's always
[1:58:58.180 --> 1:59:06.260]  said he planned to retire to and the left got so excited they said oh he's about to resign and leave
[1:59:06.260 --> 1:59:12.820]  instead of facing impeachment and he's running to florida well now we know why the president did that
[1:59:12.820 --> 1:59:17.700]  he knew the leftist controlled appeals courts were going to say that he had to give up his tax
[1:59:17.700 --> 1:59:24.500]  returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got they want to terrorize
[1:59:24.500 --> 1:59:30.580]  people that he's worked with and by moving his domicile from new york to florida that gets around
[1:59:30.580 --> 1:59:37.860]  the new york law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private so all those people
[1:59:37.860 --> 1:59:44.100]  out there holding their breath for the president to resign in his words we're kicking the deep
[1:59:44.100 --> 1:59:54.420]  states ass and he's never gonna resign you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:54.420 --> 2:00:08.020]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[2:00:19.140 --> 2:00:22.820]  i'm taking your phone calls in the shower we have several reporters popping in as well
[2:00:22.820 --> 2:00:31.620]  we're gonna go to everybody john tom trisha elicia david david dan eric alexandria and others
[2:00:33.460 --> 2:00:39.540]  alexandria in pennsylvania you're up at bat first thanks for calling in on this friday edition
[2:00:40.100 --> 2:00:45.700]  hello alex how you doing today i'm doing good my simple i'm gonna take formation since you asked
[2:00:46.260 --> 2:00:51.540]  staying in attack formation you should and god bless you and i think our prayers are helping
[2:00:51.540 --> 2:00:58.020]  with you and anything else i can fill your prayers literally holding me up i i'm serious it's
[2:00:58.020 --> 2:01:05.860]  unbelievable thank you you welcome alex my simple question is about this impeachment fiasco do you
[2:01:05.860 --> 2:01:12.980]  think that this fabricated impeachment inquisition is a facade to hide a scheme that the dems are
[2:01:12.980 --> 2:01:21.780]  creating behind you know this whole scandalous circus uh people say 110 percent how about a trillion
[2:01:21.780 --> 2:01:27.060]  percent how about infinity percent i mean that is exactly what this is doesn't matter if it's all
[2:01:27.060 --> 2:01:31.220]  a lie in a flop it still makes them the authority and it changes the subject from the reality that
[2:01:31.220 --> 2:01:40.980]  they're a bunch of knuckle dragon america hate and pedophiles so what do you think trump should do
[2:01:40.980 --> 2:01:44.740]  i think he keeps pointing that out and i hope this inspector general report that's coming
[2:01:44.740 --> 2:01:49.220]  out december 11th they've now confirmed triggers a whole bunch of indictments i mean that's what
[2:01:49.220 --> 2:01:57.540]  we need here yes yeah i i just think trump needs to heavy hand the whole situation um well that's
[2:01:57.540 --> 2:02:03.700]  his problem is when you listen when we're under extremist attack extremism and defensive liberty
[2:02:03.700 --> 2:02:08.740]  is no vicesburg all water set they're the ones that are extreme so meeting that force is not extreme
[2:02:08.740 --> 2:02:15.540]  we're not in fact we're extremely bad and cowardly if we don't respond very aggressively we're being
[2:02:15.540 --> 2:02:21.140]  attacked okay by a bunch of really bad lying people yes i mean they're literally just assaulting the
[2:02:21.140 --> 2:02:26.660]  hell out of us so i'm not wanting some big war and indictments and but you know what they brought
[2:02:26.660 --> 2:02:33.300]  the war and so i'm not gonna lay down in a ditch does that make sense yes it does it does uh i just
[2:02:33.300 --> 2:02:39.540]  i have a feeling they're cooking up something behind this whole ridiculous thing and it's
[2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:45.300]  still going to come out somehow you know they're going to continue it on but i wanted to thank you
[2:02:45.300 --> 2:02:52.900]  so much for your excellent line of health supplements alex they have improved my husband
[2:02:52.900 --> 2:03:01.060]  and i our health greatly and we have subscribed to bodies vitamin mineral infusion the super
[2:03:01.060 --> 2:03:12.020]  bluetooth paste the super cell silver gel the dna dna force plus ultra 12 vasio beat and i just got
[2:03:12.020 --> 2:03:19.700]  over a sinus infection took pollen block within three days i was getting cleared up already
[2:03:20.420 --> 2:03:24.980]  you know what's amazing ma'am i thought of this a few days ago because my wife was looking at me
[2:03:24.980 --> 2:03:29.540]  she said my god you how much weight have you lost i said well 30 pounds but i've gained a bunch of
[2:03:29.540 --> 2:03:36.100]  muscle so i really total lost about probably 35 pounds of fat and she said what are you doing
[2:03:36.100 --> 2:03:41.860]  and i said well i really just eat all my supplements now and have like three small meals but i had a
[2:03:41.860 --> 2:03:47.140]  pizza in here yesterday i ate one piece i had a couple eggs and one banana for breakfast one
[2:03:47.140 --> 2:03:52.580]  pizza pizza and then had a little bit of grilled chicken last night and because i just ate a bunch
[2:03:52.580 --> 2:03:59.940]  i ate like five fish oil caplets had some vitamin mineral fusion and i mean literally i'm just taking
[2:03:59.940 --> 2:04:02.660]  all the supplements now because i know they're all great and people are like what the hell is
[2:04:02.660 --> 2:04:06.660]  going on it looks like you're 15 years younger you've lost this weight and that's all i'm doing
[2:04:06.660 --> 2:04:09.700]  and it's just i mean i'll wait till i'm gonna do some shoots where i actually have my shirt off and
[2:04:09.700 --> 2:04:14.660]  stuff and but i'm gonna wait another week or so because now it's just it's just dripping off it's
[2:04:14.660 --> 2:04:22.180]  just racing off of me and i'm not what's crazy is your body is hungry for the nutrients and so when
[2:04:22.180 --> 2:04:26.500]  you get them out of real supplements like this you don't need the big masses of food your body
[2:04:26.500 --> 2:04:30.020]  wants masses of food because there's no real nutrients in there on average so you need more
[2:04:30.020 --> 2:04:36.340]  more more so thank you so much uh alexander anything else yeah it's just the quality of them
[2:04:36.340 --> 2:04:42.580]  you know you can go to any old store and buy supplements but your supplement your product
[2:04:42.580 --> 2:04:48.820]  lines are top quality and that's what really matters is well they are god bless you ma'am thank
[2:04:48.820 --> 2:04:52.580]  you for the support yes there's a lot of money goes into each bottle it's not a bunch of filler
[2:04:52.580 --> 2:05:01.140]  it's high quality thank you i've made a lot of predictions that have come true but i'm here to
[2:05:01.140 --> 2:05:06.660]  tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball
[2:05:06.660 --> 2:05:11.940]  i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda was what their
[2:05:11.940 --> 2:05:17.700]  goal was and i knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really
[2:05:17.700 --> 2:05:25.860]  setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and
[2:05:25.860 --> 2:05:31.540]  information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed what the
[2:05:31.540 --> 2:05:38.420]  globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of
[2:05:38.420 --> 2:05:44.740]  info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information
[2:05:44.740 --> 2:05:49.540]  dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping
[2:05:49.540 --> 2:06:05.700]  info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever we now take you live to the
[2:06:05.700 --> 2:06:21.620]  central texas command center and the heart of the resistance it's alex jones

[2:08:06.900 --> 2:08:15.140]  in michigan thanks for calling thank you for answering you bet um i just uh wanted to mention
[2:08:15.140 --> 2:08:21.860]  you've said before you've talked about the cold civil war um going on right now and um my husband's
[2:08:21.860 --> 2:08:29.220]  family has been like they're very very liberal and i've been a libertarian for a long time and um
[2:08:29.220 --> 2:08:34.500]  in the beginning we weren't really uh big fans of trump because we were scared of like the red flag
[2:08:34.500 --> 2:08:41.540]  laws and things and um but we slowly like realized he's like the best possible thing we can have
[2:08:41.540 --> 2:08:46.820]  right now and it seems like these impeachment hearings have been like emboldening the last
[2:08:46.820 --> 2:08:52.980]  a lot and um it's gotten to the point where i've lost we've lost most of my husband's side of the
[2:08:52.980 --> 2:09:01.860]  family most of my friends um because they cannot stand but i i will actually say good things when
[2:09:01.860 --> 2:09:08.100]  trump does good things well that's a great point you know i was going to talk about trump today
[2:09:08.100 --> 2:09:12.180]  because i i don't want to say an epiphany but i really thought about why i'm really upset with
[2:09:12.180 --> 2:09:17.700]  trump i'm upset with myself more than anybody that i don't work harder that i don't come up with
[2:09:17.700 --> 2:09:22.340]  better ideas that in hindsight all the time i wish that i would have done something i should have
[2:09:22.340 --> 2:09:28.900]  done then but hindsight's 2020 so the person i'm really maddest debt is me i'm not walking around
[2:09:28.900 --> 2:09:35.300]  on cloud nine that i've done this great job now i'm not depressed i'm very animated i'm very happy
[2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:45.780]  i'm energized but i'm still feeling unfulfilled a itch that i can't scratch i mean a desire
[2:09:45.780 --> 2:09:51.060]  way beyond you know wanting to have sex or wanting to eat a big meal when you're hungry
[2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:58.580]  it's a desire to protect my children and it's powerful and it's driving me and it's so fulfilling
[2:09:58.580 --> 2:10:06.340]  but it's it's fulfilling for 99% of it and it's it's it's it's empowering it's electrifying i mean
[2:10:06.340 --> 2:10:12.180]  i'm just seething right now with energy but then there's that impetus to fire the weapon
[2:10:13.700 --> 2:10:17.860]  at the point of the energy and the power rising up this isn't just to be powerful this is rising
[2:10:17.860 --> 2:10:23.780]  up to defend good this is to be projected and then you've got to expect the enemy to come back and
[2:10:23.780 --> 2:10:32.100]  you've got to be ready to fight i can feel it the human spirit refusing to be dominated by satan
[2:10:33.860 --> 2:10:39.220]  but only by reaching up to christ can we make that electrical spiritual connection to be energized
[2:10:39.940 --> 2:10:46.100]  and by joining with christ and then becoming a focal point can we reach right in and defeat satan
[2:10:46.100 --> 2:10:55.380]  satan will be defeated jesus saves when we start realizing how powerful
[2:10:58.740 --> 2:11:06.340]  our god is the real architect not the false architect and as soon as we start tapping
[2:11:06.340 --> 2:11:13.620]  into that it's unlimited but trump is kind of an island himself everything they do fails uh you
[2:11:13.620 --> 2:11:18.900]  know it's all a big joke he does a lot of good things but not going on the offense against
[2:11:18.900 --> 2:11:24.100]  their crimes and just letting them attack attack attack attack and then they get more and more
[2:11:24.100 --> 2:11:30.420]  out of control is dangerous and i get that it'll end up probably bringing them down 10 times worse
[2:11:30.420 --> 2:11:36.660]  but that process is immoral and so if the attorney general and others don't start moving quickly
[2:11:36.660 --> 2:11:45.300]  it's dereliction of duty plain and simple you do not sit here politically waiting until they're on
[2:11:45.300 --> 2:11:52.100]  top of us driving daggers into us to pull the trigger like colonel jackson said in the war with
[2:11:52.100 --> 2:11:57.940]  the british the war of 1812 he told his troops in their formations that he'd been the first
[2:11:57.940 --> 2:12:02.340]  revolutionary war his brother and mother died and his dad died before that jackson was amazing
[2:12:02.340 --> 2:12:07.780]  and he was like 12 when he joined the continental army was in the war four years the last four years
[2:12:07.780 --> 2:12:13.460]  i mean that's why it was such a badass i mean and uh he was a spy runner killed british soldier
[2:12:13.460 --> 2:12:19.620]  by the time he was 13 but side issue uh colonel jackson said wait do you see the whites of their
[2:12:19.620 --> 2:12:28.340]  eyes that's 30 40 feet and then now a musket ball has five times the power at that speed that it
[2:12:28.340 --> 2:12:34.660]  does at 200 yards 300 yards and you're gonna get them dead on and they gotta reload so you let them
[2:12:34.660 --> 2:12:41.780]  get their shots in that's what trump's doing and then when they're up close you just blast them
[2:12:41.780 --> 2:12:46.260]  politically i don't mean shoot them it's an analogy the left will claim i'm saying shoot everybody
[2:12:46.260 --> 2:12:49.380]  that i'm not they know that they just think you're stupid when they do that but you're not
[2:12:50.100 --> 2:12:55.220]  dumb you understand what i'm really saying and but i mean they're on top of us driving daggers
[2:12:55.220 --> 2:13:00.740]  into us at this point i mean the whites the guys thing left a long time ago so no the truth is the
[2:13:00.740 --> 2:13:04.980]  the swamp is paralyzing trump and the justice department is full of a bunch of cowards at the
[2:13:04.980 --> 2:13:10.580]  top and operatives and the fact that we've gotten this far you know is at least something but we
[2:13:10.580 --> 2:13:14.500]  need to just crack the whip and trump needs to get people in there they'll do their damn jobs
[2:13:14.500 --> 2:13:18.420]  and stop worrying about how they're gonna get critiqued by the deep state the deep state is
[2:13:18.420 --> 2:13:25.460]  already collapsing they're losing their power but in their death rows our inaction could let them
[2:13:26.420 --> 2:13:33.140]  grab victory from the jaws of defeat let's go ahead and alicia do you have any comments
[2:13:33.140 --> 2:13:39.780]  or questions about that or any statements um well actually yeah um you mentioned the like power of
[2:13:39.780 --> 2:13:46.740]  you know god and um we used to be like very atheist and it's like just this past year
[2:13:46.740 --> 2:13:54.260]  i really have felt like like we've really turned to christ and it's made our lives so much better
[2:13:54.260 --> 2:13:59.700]  despite the fact that we're losing family members but they were really toxic to begin with so it's
[2:13:59.700 --> 2:14:04.820]  kind of it's sad but it's a really good thing and um we're really happy and again other people pray
[2:14:04.820 --> 2:14:08.820]  to these other gods they'll tell you all over the world the the occult doesn't care about buddha
[2:14:08.820 --> 2:14:13.620]  doesn't care about this or that it cares about christ i mean it's a real energy field it's i mean
[2:14:13.620 --> 2:14:17.860]  what happened i mean to spend a minute or two the process and what what started happening
[2:14:17.860 --> 2:14:20.980]  because what happens when you're starting to turn away from the world in the devil like there's a
[2:14:20.980 --> 2:14:25.060]  block you feel gods there but you're not getting to god but as soon as it starts coming through it
[2:14:25.060 --> 2:14:30.180]  gets more stronger and stronger and then suddenly a damn breaks the holy spirit hits you i mean have
[2:14:30.180 --> 2:14:36.500]  you experienced that yet yeah um actually we were just feeling like we were missing something in our
[2:14:36.500 --> 2:14:43.460]  life like we didn't know what and we started kind of exploring and um there were people in our and um on
[2:14:43.460 --> 2:14:48.260]  my side of the family that were like you need to open your heart to christ and that means you know
[2:14:48.260 --> 2:14:54.740]  just asking him and and not not opening your heart you're not going to get an answer you have to open
[2:14:54.740 --> 2:15:02.980]  your heart and open open your mind to receiving him and when we did that it was like i i knew it was true
[2:15:02.980 --> 2:15:10.900]  had you ever felt a feeling like that before no well it's going to get a lot better but a lot of
[2:15:10.900 --> 2:15:15.860]  the churches are corrupt the devil sends his people in there to to to to do bad things to you to the
[2:15:15.860 --> 2:15:20.820]  turning off to christ that's not christ christ talked about that extensively just go directly to god
[2:15:20.820 --> 2:15:25.700]  and it just gets stronger it just gets better and the enemy knows that and and christ spirits coming
[2:15:25.700 --> 2:15:29.380]  into the planet so strong right now that's why they're so scared it's what the globalists are
[2:15:29.380 --> 2:15:35.140]  going crazy trying to bully us uh into submitting to them but it's not going to happen this is an
[2:15:35.140 --> 2:15:39.540]  amazing thing god bless you alicia thank you for your testimony you're gonna find the false
[2:15:39.540 --> 2:15:43.060]  christ in most of these churches but you're gonna find the real christ in your heart when you open
[2:15:43.060 --> 2:15:47.940]  it up but there you have demon books on conjuring demons for elementary students now sold at walmart
[2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:52.980]  so they open their heart to the devil that is so dangerous you open your heart to the devil he comes

[2:20:05.460 --> 2:20:18.740]  we are electrochemical transceivers lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[2:20:21.300 --> 2:20:32.100]  we are electrochemical transceivers we receive and we transmit that's been proven out every cell
[2:20:32.100 --> 2:20:42.820]  receives and transmits a signal the globalists a name for the forces of satan are literally with
[2:20:42.820 --> 2:20:50.420]  chemicals biologicals and then with words and actions in programming with their lexicon of
[2:20:50.420 --> 2:20:58.820]  syntax are attempting to jam the transmission with their transmission but through these different
[2:20:58.820 --> 2:21:03.060]  levels we're able to understand it and even though they're jamming it's more intense
[2:21:05.380 --> 2:21:11.460]  the background radiation of god's transmission is strong but it doesn't force its way
[2:21:12.740 --> 2:21:18.660]  the enemy forces its way in but once you're aware of that you can then with your will your consciousness
[2:21:19.620 --> 2:21:24.580]  that's free will tune to the channel even if you're in solitary confinement being tortured
[2:21:24.580 --> 2:21:30.980]  you can tune that out and tune right to christ and that's the secret they train you to think
[2:21:30.980 --> 2:21:36.340]  third dimensional you've got to go to a church you've got to go to a leader a priest who then on
[2:21:36.340 --> 2:21:43.140]  average is a satanist who is there to get control of you and make you think that you found christ
[2:21:43.140 --> 2:21:47.060]  so they can mislead you so you turn against christ and don't believe in christ that's the
[2:21:47.060 --> 2:21:52.500]  devil's biggest trick and i would say 80 percent of the church is in the world now in big industrialized
[2:21:52.500 --> 2:21:56.580]  areas are globalists run world council of churches run by the rocker fellows and they're
[2:21:56.580 --> 2:22:00.580]  either worldly or their secret atheists are leftists who went to the seminary that's all
[2:22:00.580 --> 2:22:04.660]  been admitted but then the higher up ones are satanist people like the pope and his deputy
[2:22:04.660 --> 2:22:09.300]  pope they're not catholics they're not christians um and and that's their plan that's how they
[2:22:09.300 --> 2:22:13.460]  mislead you and christ spent most of his time looking at the Pharisees and saying they're the
[2:22:13.460 --> 2:22:19.060]  ones misleading you they're not the real leaders uh they are the synagogue of satan the synagogue
[2:22:19.060 --> 2:22:23.380]  just means church and so that happens in any of these systems where you try to get to god
[2:22:24.020 --> 2:22:27.700]  there are real synagogues there are just many of them that are church of satan there are many
[2:22:27.700 --> 2:22:31.940]  churches just many of them are the church of satan so you know they go that's an anti-semitic
[2:22:31.940 --> 2:22:36.340]  thing in the bible no jesus was jewish he's saying that's not a real synagogue that's a synagogue of
[2:22:36.340 --> 2:22:41.220]  satan went in with a whip sort of beating them because they they weren't teaching about god they
[2:22:41.220 --> 2:22:45.380]  were teaching about rules and things and making themselves god and nickle and dining people i'm
[2:22:45.380 --> 2:22:51.380]  preaching i apologize Savannah Hernandez is here and man she went out to the uh trump tim cook
[2:22:51.380 --> 2:22:56.180]  kissy kiss fast and i'm glad a factory's coming here and trump's doing a good job on that front but
[2:22:56.180 --> 2:23:00.020]  he should have you know told tim cook knock off the censorship you were there you got physically
[2:23:00.020 --> 2:23:03.460]  attacked were to play some of these amazing clips these have gone viral paul watson wrote about a
[2:23:03.460 --> 2:23:06.820]  tweet about it i mean they're going viral hundreds of thousands of users this morning
[2:23:07.380 --> 2:23:10.260]  of these people tell them what happened there's two different videos we're going to play this is
[2:23:10.260 --> 2:23:15.780]  amazing well like you said i got attacked a lot by antifa members that were there they were trying
[2:23:15.780 --> 2:23:20.260]  to follow you as soon as you got there so we went and we were following them they attacked us
[2:23:20.260 --> 2:23:25.700]  several people who were trying to interview attacked us um i went out with a mega hat and i was
[2:23:25.700 --> 2:23:29.300]  holding it i was just asking people what does it mean to you what does it symbolize i wasn't even
[2:23:29.300 --> 2:23:32.900]  wearing it just holding it and showing it to them people were trying to rip it out of my hand
[2:23:32.900 --> 2:23:39.300]  they're getting really aggressive and of course i wanted to ask them well what why are you so upset
[2:23:39.300 --> 2:23:43.140]  what really brought you what was the one thing that president trump setter did
[2:23:43.140 --> 2:23:47.540]  that brought you to really feel this way and make you this angry that you had to take the whole day
[2:23:47.540 --> 2:23:53.860]  off of work to come and protest this and i went around and either people wouldn't talk to me or
[2:23:53.860 --> 2:23:59.060]  they had zero response at all which was not shocking but if you're going to be at a protest maybe
[2:23:59.060 --> 2:24:06.820]  know why you're there and this is a huge takeaway you are a smart perky attractive young woman
[2:24:06.820 --> 2:24:12.420]  so whether you're a man a woman a child we're biologically geared an attractive young nice
[2:24:12.420 --> 2:24:16.420]  sweet woman everybody likes that right that's like the you know the helper in society the good
[2:24:16.420 --> 2:24:22.420]  thing in the world what we protect what we like that she had an action seven mic she was acting
[2:24:22.420 --> 2:24:26.420]  nice they didn't know who she was and they were hateful little ignorant demons you understand
[2:24:27.300 --> 2:24:32.660]  so they're hateful to a woman saying okay how's trump bad at this and that they they didn't even
[2:24:32.660 --> 2:24:38.180]  even know who it was and they were gibbering morons and and and and also attacked you i mean these
[2:24:38.180 --> 2:24:44.740]  people are these people you can take a horse to water you can't make a drink yeah and again i
[2:24:44.740 --> 2:24:48.820]  don't understand why they were so angry at me because i wasn't going over there telling them oh
[2:24:48.820 --> 2:24:52.900]  you're dumb you're an idiot you're stupid why are you here i was simply like hey explain your sign
[2:24:52.900 --> 2:24:57.220]  to me tell me why you're here what are we upset about today no one can explain it and then of
[2:24:57.220 --> 2:25:01.220]  course it goes around like oh she's with info or she's bad don't talk to her don't talk to her
[2:25:01.220 --> 2:25:05.780]  the creator of the group or the person who really brought everyone there together
[2:25:05.780 --> 2:25:09.460]  kept following me around too so i went and confronted her and i said is there an issue
[2:25:09.460 --> 2:25:12.660]  why are you trying to stifle my first amendment she was like i'm not going to talk to you and i
[2:25:12.660 --> 2:25:16.340]  was like okay well then don't talk to me and stop following me around because you're ruining my
[2:25:16.340 --> 2:25:20.340]  interviews with people who actually do want to talk and tell me about why they're here today
[2:25:20.340 --> 2:25:25.620]  which again they didn't even know themselves so this girl could talk can't she way better than i
[2:25:25.620 --> 2:25:29.380]  can that's where i get her own show if she'll do it i'm trying folks i'm pushing her maybe soon
[2:25:29.380 --> 2:25:35.780]  but savannah you just said it again right there they not only won't talk to you they try to stop
[2:25:35.780 --> 2:25:39.940]  others from talking unless you're the approved group they're so hive minded there's a couple
[2:25:39.940 --> 2:25:45.540]  hundred of them out there and they would say i'm sorry i don't say i can't talk they're like zombies
[2:25:45.540 --> 2:25:49.380]  and i understand being put on the spot as well because you know okay there's a camera in front
[2:25:49.380 --> 2:25:53.940]  of my face i get nervous but when push comes to shove if i was at a hillary clinton protest
[2:25:53.940 --> 2:25:57.380]  and someone came and asked me why are you protesting hillary clinton i would say it's
[2:25:57.380 --> 2:26:01.380]  because you called black people super predators it's because she's done so many bad things i would
[2:26:01.380 --> 2:26:08.660]  at least have one point this is why i'm here but again no point god servers the death but you
[2:26:08.660 --> 2:26:13.460]  can't list one thing off about trump and i'm just like you guys sit here all day long and the media
[2:26:13.460 --> 2:26:18.980]  spends every single waking moment reporting on why he's bad and you can't tell me one thing just one
[2:26:19.700 --> 2:26:25.380]  just one nothing and they can't do it anywhere in the country yeah it's it's really interesting
[2:26:25.380 --> 2:26:31.380]  well it's not interesting i guess um i don't even say he's racist anymore or he likes david dupe
[2:26:31.380 --> 2:26:35.540]  none of that because it's come out now that obama again and i said this in my video as well at this
[2:26:35.540 --> 2:26:40.580]  point in his presidency he deported double the amount of people that trump currently has
[2:26:40.580 --> 2:26:44.020]  and so you bring that up and they're just like um well i wasn't following politics that's their
[2:26:44.020 --> 2:26:47.860]  new thing that they say well i wasn't following politics back then we need to focus on the president
[2:26:47.860 --> 2:26:52.340]  and i'm like okay well why weren't you focused on did you not care about it back then why is it so
[2:26:52.340 --> 2:26:56.500]  different now if you care about it now then why can't you denounce it when it happened back then
[2:26:57.780 --> 2:27:00.740]  we'll play those clips when we come back and you'll write shot down with us then we'll talk to the
[2:27:00.740 --> 2:27:08.180]  proud boys uh that have uh done some nice trolling of freido freido kwomo of course he also said that
[2:27:08.180 --> 2:27:12.820]  that's an attack on italian americans when you say freido no the italians came up with it and
[2:27:12.820 --> 2:27:18.900]  wrote the book it's the name for a dumbass and i and i guess uh mario putzos explained uh what it
[2:27:18.900 --> 2:27:23.140]  meant before he died i think in a larry king interview that i saw and he said no that's a term we
[2:27:23.140 --> 2:27:29.300]  had in our neighborhood uh we call people freidos that are dumb so the italians came up with freido
[2:27:29.300 --> 2:27:34.340]  you dumb freido so we'll talk about that and then there's the other clip too we're gonna get into
[2:27:34.340 --> 2:27:38.980]  i mean these people are just so whacked out and i don't feel empowered that they're so stupid i
[2:27:38.980 --> 2:27:45.300]  feel scared because this is a dangerous group of limits yeah i wanted to see too who our voters
[2:27:45.300 --> 2:27:51.460]  are in 2020 and i asked a lot of them as well you know who's your candidate for 2020 nobody knows
[2:27:51.460 --> 2:27:56.340]  no one even knows why they hate trump no one knows anything out here and it just it's really funny
[2:27:56.340 --> 2:28:00.660]  it's easy man on the streets for me good content no one knows what they're talking about what is it
[2:28:00.660 --> 2:28:04.580]  like though because i remember three four years ago we'd show people that were mindless at rallies
[2:28:04.580 --> 2:28:09.700]  they'd say oh they're cherry picking now even the mainstream media goes okay just don't show our people
[2:28:09.700 --> 2:28:14.180]  they know we're not cherry picking i mean it's scary i mean you go out to one of these events
[2:28:14.180 --> 2:28:19.620]  these literally look like the living dead and again i'm so against whenever anyone says oh you
[2:28:19.620 --> 2:28:25.700]  cherry pick your videos and it's not cherry picking because either no one's gonna talk to me or they're
[2:28:25.700 --> 2:28:30.180]  not or when they do talk to me they have no reason as to why they're actually protesting so i think
[2:28:30.180 --> 2:28:34.740]  the people who don't want to talk to me are just smart enough to say well i really don't have any
[2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:38.820]  coherent thought and i don't know why i'm here so i'm not going to make myself look like well i have
[2:28:38.820 --> 2:28:43.300]  to repent for something when we come back i mean seriously this is serious i've been thinking about
[2:28:43.300 --> 2:28:47.620]  this a lot and god's layered upon my heart that i should talk about this on air so we can all repent
[2:28:47.620 --> 2:28:50.740]  of it and think about what we really should do what the right thing to do is it's not good to
[2:28:50.740 --> 2:28:57.220]  make fun of these people you know it's fun it's not good we'll be right back attention gcn self-reliance

[2:29:17.300 --> 2:29:21.540]  the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the mississippi because of the
[2:29:21.540 --> 2:29:26.260]  flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it
[2:29:26.260 --> 2:29:30.820]  back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable

[2:36:04.260 --> 2:36:09.940]  just a moment but uh introduce these two videos for us and for listeners that just uh tune back
[2:36:09.940 --> 2:36:17.300]  in let me do my miacopa here we can make funny videos and make fun of leftist when they talk
[2:36:17.300 --> 2:36:22.020]  like they're mentally retarded and all these things but really these are victims brainwash
[2:36:22.020 --> 2:36:26.020]  victims many of them now the higher up controllers it's it's okay to make fun of them because they're
[2:36:26.020 --> 2:36:28.340]  evil that they know what they're doing but we got these leftist events and you said you're not
[2:36:28.340 --> 2:36:32.340]  cherry picking and almost none of them can even form a sentence and they're mean and they're stupid
[2:36:32.980 --> 2:36:38.900]  laughing at them which i'm the you know one of the main culprits of age screelix carl the cuck all
[2:36:38.900 --> 2:36:44.020]  of them means so many of these icons we brought you we discovered these superstars of idiocy but
[2:36:44.020 --> 2:36:47.620]  you know we're laughing at our fallen self right there like we're already falling but these guys
[2:36:47.620 --> 2:36:53.620]  have really fallen from grace and that's people we lost it's like laughing at a dead body in a battle
[2:36:53.620 --> 2:36:59.780]  oh look his guts are blowing out his side and he can't talk they're close to that and so even though
[2:36:59.780 --> 2:37:05.940]  they're gremlin like a lot of them i want to think of a way to be loving to them and to talk to them
[2:37:06.820 --> 2:37:09.620]  and next time i go out to one of these events so they're going to brief them because they hear
[2:37:09.620 --> 2:37:12.180]  this i'm going to go to them i'm going to find something that haven't been briefed and i'm going
[2:37:12.180 --> 2:37:17.060]  to tell them i love you i care about you let's go get lunch and i'm going to try to get five or
[2:37:17.060 --> 2:37:20.260]  six of these ante for people and i'm going to say listen to this isn't a joke we'll turn the cameras
[2:37:20.260 --> 2:37:24.580]  off let's go get lunch i really want to talk to you and i think we can talk to them and i think
[2:37:24.580 --> 2:37:29.380]  we can get through to some of them because uh just laughing at them they already feel so bad
[2:37:29.380 --> 2:37:33.860]  they already have just low self-esteem the studies show that us laughing at them when they attack us
[2:37:34.740 --> 2:37:40.580]  only come compact some more into their system of hate and i really think at the end of the day
[2:37:40.580 --> 2:37:44.180]  you know it's it's it's fun for eating popcorn but when you realize what it really is is dangerous
[2:37:45.460 --> 2:37:50.020]  i definitely agree with that alex and i think that'd be a great idea to do um obviously a lot of
[2:37:50.020 --> 2:37:55.140]  these people are in a blind rage and i think that's why as well when you confront them with the facts
[2:37:55.140 --> 2:37:59.540]  like in these videos you know i ask them what do you think about this they they don't know how to
[2:37:59.540 --> 2:38:04.420]  answer it because they aren't aware themselves they're just uneducated on these things um and by
[2:38:04.420 --> 2:38:08.100]  the way i had said you know to you six months ago i said or a year ago i want you to go out in
[2:38:08.100 --> 2:38:14.340]  man on the street and you said i don't like they're so so sorry and stupid and yeah i know exactly
[2:38:14.340 --> 2:38:20.340]  but finally you're willing to go out i'm a couple yeah we were talking about this on the break i
[2:38:20.340 --> 2:38:24.100]  said when i first started here i didn't want to go do man on the streets because i don't like making
[2:38:24.100 --> 2:38:28.580]  fun of people i don't like making people look stupid but when i went out to this event again
[2:38:28.580 --> 2:38:34.020]  this isn't me looking for specific clips that are going to be the best i went out there and i even
[2:38:34.020 --> 2:38:37.700]  livestreamed and i said hey uh what are we doing here either no one's going to talk to me or when
[2:38:37.700 --> 2:38:43.540]  they do that's what comes out of their mouths and i mean at the end of the day like that was the
[2:38:43.540 --> 2:38:48.980]  content that i got so i put it out and we just need to educate well i think that's the magic we
[2:38:48.980 --> 2:38:53.220]  show how stupid and twisted and dumbed down and evil they are and some of them are consciously
[2:38:53.220 --> 2:38:56.820]  evil so we can make fun of them but the real little zombies and stuff when i go look at your
[2:38:56.820 --> 2:39:00.580]  pathetic eyes no lie to them look you look like a zombie look your mother didn't take care of you
[2:39:00.580 --> 2:39:04.740]  and i'm really that's true they're and they all they start crying because i go well let me guess
[2:39:04.740 --> 2:39:09.620]  she left you in the crib well just because i can tell them who they are that's that's that i need
[2:39:09.620 --> 2:39:14.980]  to somehow show them love at least try it uh because these really are the victims and and now
[2:39:14.980 --> 2:39:19.940]  they want to suck us down with them well i think you wanted to get to these clips let's do it
[2:39:19.940 --> 2:39:25.540]  let's go our guests we can go to the first clip which anti-trump protester refuses to denounce
[2:39:25.540 --> 2:39:32.340]  obama for deporting more immigrants than trump this is incredible here it is make america wait
[2:39:32.340 --> 2:39:38.500]  again and all his policies and what he does kind of backs that up that's what he's looking to do
[2:39:38.500 --> 2:39:47.380]  he's trying to um take the immigration population and diminish it and diminish the people so at this
[2:39:47.380 --> 2:39:52.820]  time in obama's presidency he had way more deportations than trump has had what did you think
[2:39:52.820 --> 2:39:58.100]  about it back then when obama was reporting on follow politics and i and i have to say that
[2:39:58.100 --> 2:40:03.060]  that's the one good thing for me that came out of all this over the past three years i didn't
[2:40:03.060 --> 2:40:07.780]  follow politics it wasn't important to me but when i saw what was going on three years ago
[2:40:07.780 --> 2:40:12.420]  in this person and i saw the hate that he had well you denounced obama for putting kids in
[2:40:12.420 --> 2:40:17.140]  cages and deporting illegal immigrants i didn't follow politics and well you denounce obama
[2:40:17.140 --> 2:40:22.260]  for putting kids in cages and uh probably didn't do it to the extent that goes on now you're right
[2:40:22.260 --> 2:40:27.220]  it's doubled that and what trump is doing and there's a lot more behind trump that goes on it's
[2:40:27.220 --> 2:40:30.900]  hold your denounce obama for putting kids in cages and deporting illegal immigrants would
[2:40:30.900 --> 2:40:36.180]  i what would you denounce obama for putting kids in cages and supporting illegal immigrants i
[2:40:36.180 --> 2:40:37.420]  I would not denounce him.
[2:40:37.420 --> 2:40:38.980]  He probably didn't do it to the extent
[2:40:38.980 --> 2:40:39.940]  that it's being done now.
[2:40:39.940 --> 2:40:40.780]  He did it double.
[2:40:40.780 --> 2:40:41.620]  Oh, double.
[2:40:41.620 --> 2:40:43.180]  I don't know, but I wouldn't denounce him
[2:40:43.180 --> 2:40:47.020]  because he was his character.
[2:40:47.020 --> 2:40:48.380]  He's just, he was a gentleman.
[2:40:48.380 --> 2:40:49.620]  So it's okay to deport people
[2:40:49.620 --> 2:40:50.740]  as long as you're a good person?
[2:40:50.740 --> 2:40:55.740]  It is okay, but this person has many things against him.
[2:40:56.460 --> 2:40:59.780]  Everything about him is just corrupt.
[2:40:59.780 --> 2:41:02.860]  You could teach a whole logic clash on her
[2:41:02.860 --> 2:41:03.980]  because she's the opposite of it.
[2:41:03.980 --> 2:41:06.740]  You can use that as a teaching example.
[2:41:06.740 --> 2:41:10.060]  And just how she's disconnected from reality.
[2:41:10.060 --> 2:41:13.620]  Okay, well, when Obama didn't even do his job,
[2:41:14.620 --> 2:41:16.220]  but the courts weren't blocking completely,
[2:41:16.220 --> 2:41:18.060]  so he deported double what Trump had done
[2:41:18.060 --> 2:41:20.260]  in three years in, which is a number they admit.
[2:41:20.260 --> 2:41:21.940]  When he does it and does it in bad conditions,
[2:41:21.940 --> 2:41:24.940]  Trump fixes it up, does it better, does a better job,
[2:41:24.940 --> 2:41:26.980]  and less of it because the courts are blocking him.
[2:41:26.980 --> 2:41:29.220]  He's the Nazi, but Obama's the good guy.
[2:41:29.220 --> 2:41:31.900]  That is a total war on reality, what she just said.
[2:41:31.900 --> 2:41:34.220]  And I think the saddest part of that clip too is
[2:41:34.220 --> 2:41:36.660]  she said that Trump is what really started her
[2:41:36.660 --> 2:41:39.460]  into politics and what made her start focusing.
[2:41:39.460 --> 2:41:42.660]  And what is there for her to actually listen to now?
[2:41:42.660 --> 2:41:44.500]  All she has is a media that hates Trump
[2:41:44.500 --> 2:41:46.860]  and focuses on only the bad things that he does,
[2:41:46.860 --> 2:41:49.180]  repeats lies, repeats their rhetoric,
[2:41:49.180 --> 2:41:51.300]  exactly what they want the public to hear.
[2:41:51.300 --> 2:41:52.980]  So none of them actually know the facts
[2:41:52.980 --> 2:41:54.340]  behind what our president has done.
[2:41:54.340 --> 2:41:56.020]  All they know is this blind rage.
[2:41:56.020 --> 2:41:57.980]  And that's why we get people like this
[2:41:57.980 --> 2:42:00.140]  who refuse to denounce exactly
[2:42:00.140 --> 2:42:03.020]  what they're protesting Trump for when Obama did it.
[2:42:03.020 --> 2:42:03.860]  And this is central.
[2:42:03.860 --> 2:42:05.100]  We're gonna go to break it back with our guests
[2:42:05.100 --> 2:42:06.660]  and play one more of her clips and get to their clip.
[2:42:06.660 --> 2:42:07.660]  They'll be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[2:42:07.660 --> 2:42:08.500]  The Nick Baggins takes over.
[2:42:08.500 --> 2:42:10.140]  This is the key to it.
[2:42:10.140 --> 2:42:12.460]  She just said it and the lady just said it.
[2:42:12.460 --> 2:42:16.020]  Most of these new anti-Trumpers were total zombies.
[2:42:16.020 --> 2:42:17.420]  They weren't even politically dialed in,
[2:42:17.420 --> 2:42:19.460]  but they're pop TV viewers.
[2:42:19.460 --> 2:42:22.580]  They're sitcom viewers with all these plots
[2:42:22.580 --> 2:42:24.060]  that attack me, Trump, everybody.
[2:42:24.060 --> 2:42:26.380]  So these are fiction lovers.
[2:42:26.380 --> 2:42:28.540]  And they have now believed that fiction is reality.
[2:42:28.540 --> 2:42:30.060]  That's why they believe lies.
[2:42:30.060 --> 2:42:33.460]  And so they are the most uninformed,
[2:42:33.460 --> 2:42:35.260]  most delusional, not even really stupid,
[2:42:35.260 --> 2:42:38.260]  just most of the trance that are now being activated
[2:42:38.260 --> 2:42:40.700]  as the literal zombie armies.
[2:42:40.700 --> 2:42:44.820]  How do we wave a wand or kiss the toad
[2:42:44.820 --> 2:42:47.540]  and get them to stop acting like this?
[2:42:47.540 --> 2:42:49.580]  Is there some way to get them out of the trance?
[2:42:49.580 --> 2:42:51.260]  We'll be back with Savannah Hernandez
[2:42:51.260 --> 2:42:53.580]  and the Proud Boys from New York State with us.
[2:42:55.140 --> 2:42:58.300]  Infoorstore.com, we have a new product
[2:42:58.300 --> 2:43:00.740]  and we got several thousand of these in
[2:43:00.740 --> 2:43:02.220]  and they're gonna sell out in a few days
[2:43:02.220 --> 2:43:03.420]  at the rate we're selling them.
[2:43:03.420 --> 2:43:05.100]  I wanna thank the listeners for getting it,
[2:43:05.100 --> 2:43:08.620]  but this really is a game-changing toothpaste
[2:43:08.620 --> 2:43:11.460]  and it doesn't compete with super blue
[2:43:11.460 --> 2:43:13.260]  that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine
[2:43:13.260 --> 2:43:16.660]  and fluoride-free, the adult or the children's.
[2:43:16.660 --> 2:43:18.340]  These are both excellent toothpaste,
[2:43:18.340 --> 2:43:20.180]  concentrates that don't have fillers.
[2:43:20.180 --> 2:43:21.100]  People love it.
[2:43:21.100 --> 2:43:22.620]  This is a whitening toothpaste
[2:43:22.620 --> 2:43:25.860]  that also has the above sea coral calcium
[2:43:25.860 --> 2:43:29.980]  that also cleans, but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[2:43:29.980 --> 2:43:32.620]  Then it has the patented silver salt,
[2:43:32.620 --> 2:43:34.380]  silver in it to knock out the bacteria
[2:43:34.380 --> 2:43:35.460]  that cause ginsivitis.
[2:43:35.460 --> 2:43:37.820]  This is all proven, you can make claims with this.
[2:43:37.820 --> 2:43:41.380]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good
[2:43:41.380 --> 2:43:44.220]  for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses
[2:43:44.220 --> 2:43:46.460]  and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way
[2:43:46.460 --> 2:43:48.940]  that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[2:43:48.940 --> 2:43:50.340]  So we're really proud of it.
[2:43:50.340 --> 2:43:51.300]  It funds the operation.
[2:43:51.300 --> 2:43:54.020]  Infoorstore.com, that's why we're still on air.
[2:43:54.020 --> 2:43:59.020]  Thanks to you, Beto O'Rourke came out dozens of times
[2:43:59.500 --> 2:44:00.780]  and said, we're gonna confiscate
[2:44:00.780 --> 2:44:02.140]  all your semi-automatic rifles.
[2:44:02.140 --> 2:44:05.180]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage,
[2:44:05.180 --> 2:44:08.780]  nine others to agree and said that he was a hero.
[2:44:08.780 --> 2:44:09.940]  Think about that.
[2:44:09.940 --> 2:44:12.100]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns
[2:44:12.100 --> 2:44:13.540]  in the cities they control.
[2:44:13.540 --> 2:44:16.420]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes
[2:44:16.420 --> 2:44:20.220]  covered with needles and with massive drug dealing
[2:44:20.220 --> 2:44:22.660]  and incredible levels of violent crime.
[2:44:22.660 --> 2:44:25.100]  They know what they're doing.
[2:44:25.100 --> 2:44:27.380]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled
[2:44:27.380 --> 2:44:30.460]  that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[2:44:30.460 --> 2:44:33.100]  for what criminals do using their firearms.
[2:44:33.100 --> 2:44:34.660]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:44:34.660 --> 2:44:36.500]  this country's under such incredible attack.
[2:44:36.500 --> 2:44:40.060]  But more and more towns and cities are saying
[2:44:40.060 --> 2:44:42.340]  they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[2:44:42.340 --> 2:44:44.420]  and they're gonna follow the original Bill of Rights
[2:44:44.420 --> 2:44:46.780]  and Constitution and they're not gonna help
[2:44:46.780 --> 2:44:48.540]  in the confiscation of guns.
[2:44:48.540 --> 2:44:51.420]  So you see, a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[2:44:51.420 --> 2:44:53.900]  Well, we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[2:44:53.900 --> 2:44:58.900]  There's a famous quote by Marine Court General
[2:45:00.660 --> 2:45:04.140]  in the Korean War when three million Chai comms
[2:45:04.140 --> 2:45:08.300]  had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[2:45:08.300 --> 2:45:11.740]  More than 50 to one, some estimates have it.
[2:45:11.740 --> 2:45:13.700]  But the point is they were outnumbered
[2:45:13.700 --> 2:45:15.820]  and the general was told,
[2:45:15.820 --> 2:45:16.900]  general were completely surrounded.
[2:45:16.900 --> 2:45:21.180]  He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[2:45:21.180 --> 2:45:25.300]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached.
[2:45:25.300 --> 2:45:27.460]  And it really is epic, it really is biblical
[2:45:27.460 --> 2:45:29.220]  and we wouldn't have gone this far
[2:45:29.220 --> 2:45:30.620]  without all your support.
[2:45:31.500 --> 2:45:34.860]  But it's gonna become more critical than ever
[2:45:34.860 --> 2:45:37.780]  as the censorship becomes complete.
[2:45:37.780 --> 2:45:39.100]  And it's not just Americans,
[2:45:39.100 --> 2:45:42.020]  but folks all over the world are completely silenced
[2:45:42.020 --> 2:45:43.460]  when it comes to speaking the name
[2:45:43.460 --> 2:45:47.220]  of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[2:45:47.220 --> 2:45:50.460]  or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[2:45:50.460 --> 2:45:53.020]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform,
[2:45:53.020 --> 2:45:55.060]  that checkmate's the globalist.
[2:45:57.060 --> 2:46:01.820]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[2:46:01.820 --> 2:46:05.260]  What is the level of tyranny
[2:46:06.500 --> 2:46:09.700]  that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[2:46:09.700 --> 2:46:10.660]  How far will they go?
[2:46:10.660 --> 2:46:11.700]  What's their limit?
[2:46:11.700 --> 2:46:15.420]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women
[2:46:16.460 --> 2:46:17.380]  will submit.
[2:46:17.380 --> 2:46:21.820]  The answer is there is no limit to evil.
[2:46:21.820 --> 2:46:23.700]  It is a bottomless pit.
[2:46:24.820 --> 2:46:27.220]  We've been taught in modern culture and society
[2:46:27.220 --> 2:46:30.180]  that evil doesn't exist.
[2:46:30.180 --> 2:46:31.740]  Or that there's no free will,
[2:46:31.740 --> 2:46:33.500]  there's no devil or the God.
[2:46:33.500 --> 2:46:36.260]  But those very same people have all these rules for us
[2:46:36.260 --> 2:46:39.780]  about speech and how we can dress
[2:46:39.780 --> 2:46:43.580]  and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[2:46:43.580 --> 2:46:45.980]  They just don't want us to have any values
[2:46:45.980 --> 2:46:47.700]  so they can run over us.
[2:46:47.700 --> 2:46:49.700]  Oxford's banned clapping.
[2:46:49.700 --> 2:46:52.020]  Universities in the US have banned 21 gun salutes
[2:46:52.020 --> 2:46:53.140]  for veterans.
[2:46:53.140 --> 2:46:55.060]  These people are dangerous cult leaders
[2:46:55.060 --> 2:46:56.460]  and it's time to reject them.
[2:46:59.180 --> 2:47:02.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:09.620 --> 2:47:12.780]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[2:47:12.780 --> 2:47:16.980]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:16.980 --> 2:47:21.780]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live
[2:47:21.780 --> 2:47:25.060]  here in this country.
[2:47:25.060 --> 2:47:26.420]  Arping on the way.
[2:47:26.420 --> 2:47:28.020]  You know, when you say you're the tip of the spear,
[2:47:28.020 --> 2:47:29.820]  you really better be the tip of the spear.
[2:47:29.820 --> 2:47:31.740]  And that means you're gonna get some flak, folks.
[2:47:31.740 --> 2:47:35.740]  We're ready for it because we got you.
[2:47:35.740 --> 2:47:37.580]  You're praying for us, you're financially supporting us,
[2:47:37.580 --> 2:47:38.980]  you're spreading the word.
[2:47:38.980 --> 2:47:40.620]  You do those three things,
[2:47:40.620 --> 2:47:42.300]  you give us tips and information as well.
[2:47:42.300 --> 2:47:46.700]  Those four things, we're as a finest, finest frog here.
[2:47:46.700 --> 2:47:47.980]  Thanks to you, so I'm very thankful
[2:47:47.980 --> 2:47:49.700]  to the listeners and this great crew.
[2:47:49.700 --> 2:47:51.420]  And these fellas, we're about to talk to you
[2:47:51.420 --> 2:47:53.460]  about 15 minutes to the next hour.
[2:47:53.460 --> 2:47:54.380]  Cause I got to them a little bit late
[2:47:54.380 --> 2:47:55.220]  cause we're behind today.
[2:47:55.220 --> 2:47:56.980]  I apologize for that and I apologize to Nick Begich.
[2:47:56.980 --> 2:47:59.220]  He'll be up at 15 after next hour,
[2:47:59.220 --> 2:48:01.460]  always loaded for bear doing the last hour.
[2:48:01.460 --> 2:48:03.780]  So of the Friday, fourth hour.
[2:48:03.780 --> 2:48:05.900]  And then we have the War Room
[2:48:05.900 --> 2:48:07.220]  and so much more coming up at Savannah.
[2:48:07.220 --> 2:48:08.780]  You're gonna rock Chuck then too.
[2:48:08.780 --> 2:48:10.420]  Savannah Hernandez, our amazing reporter.
[2:48:10.420 --> 2:48:11.940]  Let's play this other clip.
[2:48:11.940 --> 2:48:15.660]  Anti-Trump protesters don't even know why they're protesting.
[2:48:15.660 --> 2:48:17.940]  And by the way, she has hours of this.
[2:48:17.940 --> 2:48:19.220]  This is how they all are.
[2:48:19.220 --> 2:48:20.460]  This is just a sampling.
[2:48:20.460 --> 2:48:21.660]  Here it is.
[2:48:21.660 --> 2:48:23.700]  What's the biggest thing that Trump has said?
[2:48:23.700 --> 2:48:25.180]  What is the biggest action he's taken
[2:48:25.180 --> 2:48:27.660]  that's really pushed you to want to come protest?
[2:48:29.300 --> 2:48:30.940]  The count, the list is endless.
[2:48:30.940 --> 2:48:33.500]  I don't think I could come up with a single one.
[2:48:33.500 --> 2:48:35.260]  Can you give me one specific thing that he's done?
[2:48:35.260 --> 2:48:37.380]  What's the biggest thing to use specifically?
[2:48:37.380 --> 2:48:38.220]  He's done.
[2:48:38.220 --> 2:48:43.220]  I don't know, it's from day one, he was just an evil mother.
[2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:48.780]  Well, of course I'm gonna make America great
[2:48:48.780 --> 2:48:51.380]  and that he's gonna bring jobs
[2:48:51.380 --> 2:48:55.500]  and that he's taking care of everybody and that...
[2:48:55.500 --> 2:48:58.180]  Wait, so one of the worst things that he said is...
[2:48:58.180 --> 2:49:00.620]  Those are the worst things and also that
[2:49:00.620 --> 2:49:03.340]  when he said that he was gonna help the people
[2:49:03.340 --> 2:49:05.020]  from Syria and he never did,
[2:49:05.020 --> 2:49:07.820]  I thought that was one of the worst things ever.
[2:49:07.820 --> 2:49:09.540]  It's just his entire person,
[2:49:09.540 --> 2:49:12.700]  the persona that he is, everything about him, just to me.
[2:49:12.700 --> 2:49:16.180]  Yes, everything about him, he just lies, everything he does.
[2:49:16.180 --> 2:49:19.140]  What's one of the biggest lies that really angered you?
[2:49:20.700 --> 2:49:22.180]  Michael, do you have something?
[2:49:22.180 --> 2:49:24.700]  He starts from the time he is inaugurated,
[2:49:24.700 --> 2:49:27.260]  all the way from the crowd size, all the way to...
[2:49:28.340 --> 2:49:30.580]  Oh, it's a perfect phone call, what he's saying now
[2:49:30.580 --> 2:49:33.260]  with this phone call that's listed.
[2:49:33.260 --> 2:49:35.180]  Did you read the transcript?
[2:49:35.180 --> 2:49:36.900]  No, I didn't read the transcript
[2:49:36.900 --> 2:49:38.020]  and I listened to the...
[2:49:38.020 --> 2:49:39.940]  I listened to who I've been following it on in the news.
[2:49:39.940 --> 2:49:41.700]  What is one of the most divisive things
[2:49:41.700 --> 2:49:43.340]  that Trump has said to you that really pushed you
[2:49:43.340 --> 2:49:45.140]  to want to come protest today?
[2:49:45.140 --> 2:49:47.980]  Oh...
[2:49:47.980 --> 2:49:49.620]  I can't think right now.
[2:49:49.620 --> 2:49:52.340]  No, just one thing, just one big thing that Trump did.
[2:49:52.340 --> 2:49:55.020]  Beg, answer that, answer that, answer that, answer that.
[2:49:55.020 --> 2:49:56.460]  There may be another exit.
[2:49:56.460 --> 2:49:57.940]  Let's go and do this thing.
[2:49:57.940 --> 2:49:59.260]  No?
[2:50:00.260 --> 2:50:02.260]  Just one thing?
[2:50:02.260 --> 2:50:04.180]  I should have led the broadcast with that today
[2:50:04.180 --> 2:50:05.500]  because everybody's seen other videos
[2:50:05.500 --> 2:50:07.300]  like this around the country.
[2:50:07.300 --> 2:50:11.780]  And what's scary is these people think they're good.
[2:50:11.780 --> 2:50:15.100]  They think they're in the moral right
[2:50:15.100 --> 2:50:17.060]  and they don't even know that she's an informer's reporter.
[2:50:17.060 --> 2:50:18.460]  She's action seven.
[2:50:18.460 --> 2:50:22.660]  We've got a lot of those flags that are just kind of
[2:50:22.660 --> 2:50:24.140]  designed to be receptive who we're with.
[2:50:24.140 --> 2:50:25.620]  Those are the organizations we've created,
[2:50:25.620 --> 2:50:27.300]  little channels we have,
[2:50:27.300 --> 2:50:29.180]  so that we can actually try to talk to them
[2:50:29.180 --> 2:50:30.340]  without the triggering.
[2:50:31.300 --> 2:50:34.580]  The old guy with the blue hat was flipping me off
[2:50:34.580 --> 2:50:36.140]  for hours in my face,
[2:50:36.140 --> 2:50:37.820]  telling me he was gonna get me and all this stuff,
[2:50:37.820 --> 2:50:39.140]  the raw videos on informers.
[2:50:40.380 --> 2:50:43.500]  Another guy had a police dog menacing people with it
[2:50:43.500 --> 2:50:46.540]  and he was scaring us.
[2:50:46.540 --> 2:50:48.500]  I mean, if his dog would have bitten me,
[2:50:48.500 --> 2:50:49.620]  he would have gone to jail.
[2:50:49.620 --> 2:50:51.500]  His dog would be taken, his head cut off
[2:50:51.500 --> 2:50:52.860]  and sent to be tested for rabies.
[2:50:52.860 --> 2:50:53.700]  I don't want that to happen.
[2:50:53.700 --> 2:50:55.500]  If the dog's just an animal,
[2:50:55.500 --> 2:50:59.980]  this guy brought it there trying to threaten to kill me.
[2:50:59.980 --> 2:51:01.700]  Basically with it, I'm menacing.
[2:51:01.700 --> 2:51:03.500]  And the guy's like, I'm gonna get you
[2:51:03.500 --> 2:51:04.860]  and he'd bring the dog over and have it there.
[2:51:04.860 --> 2:51:05.700]  Like it scared me.
[2:51:05.700 --> 2:51:06.700]  I was like, give me a break, man.
[2:51:06.700 --> 2:51:07.620]  Dog bite?
[2:51:07.620 --> 2:51:09.060]  I mean, come on.
[2:51:09.060 --> 2:51:10.340]  We were like 10 years old, we'd go down
[2:51:10.340 --> 2:51:11.620]  where people let their dogs off leeches
[2:51:11.620 --> 2:51:13.180]  and get in fights with them on purpose
[2:51:13.180 --> 2:51:15.260]  and the police would chase us off
[2:51:15.260 --> 2:51:17.300]  after we smashed big rocks on top, bit bull's heads.
[2:51:17.300 --> 2:51:18.580]  I mean, am I trying to act tough?
[2:51:18.580 --> 2:51:20.620]  We used to go fight dogs for fun when I was a kid.
[2:51:20.620 --> 2:51:21.860]  It is kind of a mean thing.
[2:51:21.860 --> 2:51:23.140]  But doing it, it got bit a few times,
[2:51:23.140 --> 2:51:26.700]  but that's just how crazy all of this is.
[2:51:26.700 --> 2:51:30.020]  And I wanna bring in one of the top proud boys
[2:51:30.020 --> 2:51:31.780]  in the country, great guy who's been on before
[2:51:31.780 --> 2:51:35.220]  and RK, Tario, proud boys chairman,
[2:51:35.220 --> 2:51:36.860]  congressional candidate, website,
[2:51:36.860 --> 2:51:40.780]  Tario2020.com, T-A-R-R-I-O,
[2:51:40.780 --> 2:51:42.540]  2020 with a cool name, I love that name, Tario.
[2:51:42.540 --> 2:51:43.900]  I was only a race car driver.
[2:51:43.900 --> 2:51:45.340]  But what he is, is a patriot.
[2:51:45.340 --> 2:51:47.460]  And of course, we also have Jacob Ingalls,
[2:51:47.460 --> 2:51:48.980]  a syndicated writer.
[2:51:48.980 --> 2:51:52.340]  He's got an article out for infowars.com right now.
[2:51:52.340 --> 2:51:53.300]  Getting into all this,
[2:51:53.300 --> 2:51:55.460]  hope people share it with the video.
[2:51:55.460 --> 2:51:58.020]  Epic, hopefully we'll go viral video
[2:51:58.020 --> 2:52:00.060]  of the proud boys trolling
[2:52:00.060 --> 2:52:03.740]  Chris Cuomo now forever known as Fredo Cuomo.
[2:52:03.740 --> 2:52:05.780]  So gentlemen, thanks for joining us.
[2:52:05.780 --> 2:52:07.140]  We're gonna play this video in a few minutes,
[2:52:07.140 --> 2:52:10.340]  but we should talk about these ongoing show trials,
[2:52:10.340 --> 2:52:12.380]  not just of Roger, but of the proud boys
[2:52:12.380 --> 2:52:13.780]  and the latest on that.
[2:52:13.780 --> 2:52:15.580]  So please give us an update, Tario.
[2:52:16.900 --> 2:52:21.820]  I think the Roger thing ties in exactly why we went
[2:52:21.820 --> 2:52:22.700]  to New York.
[2:52:22.700 --> 2:52:26.940]  So we got political persecution coming in DC
[2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:27.820]  on the federal system.
[2:52:27.820 --> 2:52:30.540]  And then we have it coming at the state system
[2:52:30.540 --> 2:52:34.540]  where these nine men essentially defended themselves
[2:52:34.540 --> 2:52:36.460]  against the Antifa horde.
[2:52:36.460 --> 2:52:40.140]  And I got four years in prison for it
[2:52:40.140 --> 2:52:43.300]  while the judge in the case, the prosecutor,
[2:52:43.300 --> 2:52:46.940]  have let off pedophiles with three month sentences,
[2:52:46.940 --> 2:52:51.940]  have let off heroin dealers with zero sentence.
[2:52:52.380 --> 2:52:54.660]  They just close the case, they throw it out.
[2:52:54.660 --> 2:52:56.660]  And then our guys for defending themselves,
[2:52:56.660 --> 2:52:58.860]  it's four years in prison.
[2:52:58.860 --> 2:53:00.340]  That is crazy.
[2:53:01.860 --> 2:53:04.500]  And it's really totalitarian, like you said.
[2:53:04.500 --> 2:53:05.460]  I mean, what's happened to Roger,
[2:53:05.460 --> 2:53:06.300]  what's happened to everybody?
[2:53:06.300 --> 2:53:07.940]  I don't know if you guys saw the clip yesterday,
[2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:09.460]  them bragging, yeah, he's a felon,
[2:53:09.460 --> 2:53:10.660]  yeah, he deserves to go to jail.
[2:53:10.660 --> 2:53:13.540]  He lied and said Fiona Hill works for Soros
[2:53:13.540 --> 2:53:14.380]  as a globalist.
[2:53:14.380 --> 2:53:16.820]  She goes, I have not done any of that perjury.
[2:53:16.820 --> 2:53:18.860]  What he's been convicted of not doing.
[2:53:18.860 --> 2:53:23.220]  And she's the head writer at theglobalist.com,
[2:53:23.220 --> 2:53:27.780]  C.F.R. was the top board member on his main foundation
[2:53:27.780 --> 2:53:30.300]  worked directly for his foundation.
[2:53:31.340 --> 2:53:33.340]  And she got money from the Ford Foundation
[2:53:33.340 --> 2:53:35.660]  that famously truly was anti-Semitic,
[2:53:35.660 --> 2:53:36.660]  but then she called us that.
[2:53:36.660 --> 2:53:38.620]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[2:53:38.620 --> 2:53:40.500]  It's outrageous, Alex.
[2:53:40.500 --> 2:53:41.840]  It's outrageous.
[2:53:41.840 --> 2:53:43.180]  Jacob, what's your view on that?
[2:53:43.180 --> 2:53:44.460]  I mean, I don't even remember this,
[2:53:44.460 --> 2:53:46.900]  I've known you for years, but you're Jewish, right?
[2:53:47.900 --> 2:53:51.060]  I'm actually not, I'm a raised Roman Catholic,
[2:53:51.060 --> 2:53:54.340]  but I have a great affinity for Jewish people in Israel.
[2:53:54.340 --> 2:53:55.180]  You're gay.
[2:53:55.180 --> 2:53:56.020]  That's what it is.
[2:53:56.020 --> 2:53:57.340]  There's always something.
[2:53:57.340 --> 2:53:59.020]  My point is, I didn't even know
[2:53:59.020 --> 2:54:02.780]  that whoever that idiot, Lieutenant Colonel was Jewish.
[2:54:02.780 --> 2:54:05.140]  They go, they're saying he's bad because he's Jewish.
[2:54:05.140 --> 2:54:06.380]  I didn't even know he was Jewish.
[2:54:06.380 --> 2:54:08.060]  I don't even pay attention to what people are.
[2:54:08.060 --> 2:54:09.220]  I pay attention to what they say.
[2:54:09.220 --> 2:54:10.060]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[2:54:10.060 --> 2:54:12.060]  Just drives me crazy.
[2:54:12.060 --> 2:54:13.500]  No, no, we're all humans, Alex.
[2:54:13.500 --> 2:54:14.940]  It goes back to the point you were talking about
[2:54:14.940 --> 2:54:16.420]  a segment ago with Savannah.
[2:54:16.420 --> 2:54:18.180]  We should really try and reach these people
[2:54:18.180 --> 2:54:21.180]  on a human level, unfortunately, so many times
[2:54:21.180 --> 2:54:22.780]  they don't want to treat us like humans.
[2:54:22.780 --> 2:54:24.620]  So we're stuck in this situation
[2:54:24.620 --> 2:54:26.780]  where we're compassionate, we have a heart,
[2:54:26.780 --> 2:54:28.500]  we care about people, we care about God,
[2:54:28.500 --> 2:54:31.780]  we care about country, but these people care about nothing
[2:54:31.780 --> 2:54:36.180]  except advancing themselves towards a globalist society.
[2:54:36.180 --> 2:54:38.940]  So we, all too often conservatives,
[2:54:38.940 --> 2:54:40.740]  sit there and say, let's turn the other cheek,
[2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:45.340]  let's show compassion, and we just keep getting a foot,
[2:54:45.340 --> 2:54:48.500]  a foot on our throat, and I think it's about time,
[2:54:48.500 --> 2:54:49.980]  high time, that we stand up.
[2:54:50.980 --> 2:54:51.940]  I agree.
[2:54:51.940 --> 2:54:55.340]  Going back to the Proud Boys leader,
[2:54:57.260 --> 2:55:00.340]  let's get into Cuomo because I'm glad that you guys
[2:55:00.340 --> 2:55:02.540]  are fighting back against this tyranny,
[2:55:02.540 --> 2:55:04.660]  Efredo, and are actually getting out there
[2:55:04.660 --> 2:55:06.860]  because the power of street art at actions like this
[2:55:06.860 --> 2:55:08.860]  is really critical for not just you guys,
[2:55:08.860 --> 2:55:10.060]  for all of us to be doing it.
[2:55:10.060 --> 2:55:11.860]  That's why I'm getting out in crowds more,
[2:55:11.860 --> 2:55:15.140]  I'm going out in public more, I'm engaging more.
[2:55:15.140 --> 2:55:18.420]  Well, it starts off with like getting banned
[2:55:18.420 --> 2:55:20.980]  on social media, and then you've seen in my case,
[2:55:20.980 --> 2:55:23.180]  you get banned off of your bank account.
[2:55:23.180 --> 2:55:24.660]  Now that's just the beginning,
[2:55:24.660 --> 2:55:26.780]  and I know that happened to you too.
[2:55:26.780 --> 2:55:27.620]  That's just the beginning.
[2:55:27.620 --> 2:55:29.980]  What they do is they use these tools to silence us
[2:55:29.980 --> 2:55:33.140]  so we won't be able to fight back against these stories.
[2:55:33.140 --> 2:55:37.420]  So then it goes over to like the state level
[2:55:37.420 --> 2:55:42.420]  where the prosecutors are using these media headlines
[2:55:42.420 --> 2:55:46.060]  to persecute these people for their political views.
[2:55:46.060 --> 2:55:49.620]  So what they did, it's a gift and a curse,
[2:55:49.620 --> 2:55:51.660]  getting banned off of social media somewhere
[2:55:51.660 --> 2:55:55.500]  where me as a candidate, you can't even show support
[2:55:55.500 --> 2:55:57.940]  for me as a candidate on Facebook right now.
[2:55:57.940 --> 2:56:01.700]  But those are things in order to silence you
[2:56:01.700 --> 2:56:04.460]  and then we're seeing the evolution of it
[2:56:04.460 --> 2:56:08.900]  with them putting us in prison for fighting back.
[2:56:08.900 --> 2:56:13.900]  And the gift comes in and it makes us more active
[2:56:14.500 --> 2:56:18.740]  in real life where we see that it's not just social things.
[2:56:19.820 --> 2:56:21.300]  It's not just the digital world
[2:56:21.300 --> 2:56:22.540]  where we have to be activists.
[2:56:22.540 --> 2:56:25.780]  We have to actually go out into the real world,
[2:56:25.780 --> 2:56:28.940]  put these banners up, host a rally, protest.
[2:56:30.020 --> 2:56:32.700]  And in some cases, I mean, those things
[2:56:32.700 --> 2:56:34.060]  are limited in their reach.
[2:56:34.060 --> 2:56:38.140]  I think the next step, we have people like Cenk
[2:56:38.140 --> 2:56:40.260]  that's running now for Congress too.
[2:56:42.420 --> 2:56:46.300]  And all of this that we're doing doesn't amount
[2:56:46.300 --> 2:56:48.780]  to the dry ink on a sheet of paper
[2:56:48.780 --> 2:56:50.180]  from a Senator or Congressman.
[2:56:50.180 --> 2:56:51.300]  That's why I'm running for Congress
[2:56:51.300 --> 2:56:52.740]  because these things gotta change.
[2:56:52.740 --> 2:56:54.460]  This has to stop.
[2:56:54.460 --> 2:56:56.540]  This is, there's no crime committed here.
[2:56:56.540 --> 2:56:59.380]  We put up some banners to go against
[2:56:59.380 --> 2:57:02.300]  the fascist state of New York,
[2:57:02.300 --> 2:57:04.220]  starting with Governor Cuomo,
[2:57:04.220 --> 2:57:05.980]  which is the first one that sent out the tweet
[2:57:05.980 --> 2:57:10.420]  that put our guys in jail, essentially.
[2:57:10.420 --> 2:57:11.500]  This has to stop.
[2:57:11.500 --> 2:57:14.060]  And we have to stop it by being on the streets,
[2:57:15.140 --> 2:57:17.620]  getting members of Congress elected,
[2:57:17.620 --> 2:57:20.300]  city officials, we've had,
[2:57:20.300 --> 2:57:24.420]  the Proud Boys have had seven, in the past three weeks,
[2:57:24.420 --> 2:57:29.220]  we've had seven members when elected seats across the country.
[2:57:29.220 --> 2:57:33.580]  We need to put our people in those positions
[2:57:33.580 --> 2:57:35.100]  where they can make those changes
[2:57:35.100 --> 2:57:37.100]  that you can stick to tonight.
[2:57:37.100 --> 2:57:37.940]  Enrique, stay right there,
[2:57:37.940 --> 2:57:39.820]  fourth hour coming up, what you just said is key.
[2:57:39.820 --> 2:57:42.780]  Two things you said made me get chills up my back.
[2:57:42.780 --> 2:57:43.620]  We'll be right back.
[2:57:47.100 --> 2:57:49.900]  About a month ago, President Trump announced
[2:57:49.900 --> 2:57:51.860]  that he was gonna move his domicile
[2:57:51.860 --> 2:57:54.340]  from New York City to Florida,
[2:57:54.340 --> 2:57:56.660]  where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[2:57:56.660 --> 2:57:59.780]  And the left got so excited.
[2:57:59.780 --> 2:58:02.540]  They said, oh, he's about to resign
[2:58:02.540 --> 2:58:05.540]  and leave instead of facing impeachment
[2:58:05.540 --> 2:58:07.740]  and he's running to Florida.
[2:58:07.740 --> 2:58:09.900]  Well, now we know why the president did that.
[2:58:09.900 --> 2:58:12.780]  He knew the leftist controlled appeals courts.
[2:58:12.780 --> 2:58:15.620]  We're gonna say that he had to give up his tax returns
[2:58:15.620 --> 2:58:17.540]  so they can pour over them and harass
[2:58:17.540 --> 2:58:20.100]  every business partner he's got.
[2:58:20.100 --> 2:58:24.140]  They wanna terrorize people that he's worked with.
[2:58:24.140 --> 2:58:26.860]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida,
[2:58:26.860 --> 2:58:29.620]  that gets around the New York law they passed
[2:58:29.620 --> 2:58:33.700]  to get is tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[2:58:33.700 --> 2:58:36.860]  So all those people out there holding their breath
[2:58:36.860 --> 2:58:38.900]  for the president to resign.
[2:58:38.900 --> 2:58:42.540]  In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass
[2:58:42.540 --> 2:58:44.220]  and he's never gonna resign.
[2:58:46.140 --> 2:58:49.420]  Major report out of major university,
[2:58:49.420 --> 2:58:51.740]  researchers working on food-based treatment
[2:58:51.740 --> 2:58:55.100]  to slow aging science daily, probiotics in the gut
[2:58:55.100 --> 2:58:58.140]  of a particular type, cause your entire body to be healthier
[2:58:58.140 --> 2:59:00.060]  and make you live longer and make you not get
[2:59:00.060 --> 2:59:01.020]  intestinal cancer.
[2:59:01.020 --> 2:59:02.900]  We have the very best formula, literally,
[2:59:02.900 --> 2:59:04.740]  with what they even mentioned in the studies.
[2:59:04.740 --> 2:59:08.900]  And it explains the hormone called FGF21,
[2:59:08.900 --> 2:59:11.620]  pro longevity heals the entire body
[2:59:11.620 --> 2:59:14.660]  and actually reverses aging but is only made
[2:59:14.660 --> 2:59:16.620]  in the lower intestine.
[2:59:16.620 --> 2:59:17.460]  Oh, and what does it say?
[2:59:17.460 --> 2:59:21.460]  It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries
[2:59:21.460 --> 2:59:22.740]  that grows this.
[2:59:22.740 --> 2:59:24.660]  And yes, this is a plug, gut fusion.
[2:59:24.660 --> 2:59:26.340]  And what do we have in this?
[2:59:26.340 --> 2:59:29.500]  High auric berry blend, strawberry, blueberry,
[2:59:29.500 --> 2:59:33.100]  blackberry, cranberry, escoblio, grape, and pomegranate.
[2:59:33.100 --> 2:59:36.740]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this.
[2:59:36.740 --> 2:59:38.980]  Gut fusion for children, for young people,
[2:59:38.980 --> 2:59:40.100]  for old people, for everybody.
[2:59:40.100 --> 2:59:42.140]  This is fiber and glutamine.
[2:59:42.140 --> 2:59:43.460]  You're not gonna find a better formula.
[2:59:43.460 --> 2:59:44.820]  Gut fusion, it's amazing.
[2:59:44.820 --> 2:59:46.020]  In PolarStore.com.
[2:59:48.780 --> 2:59:51.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:51.860 --> 2:59:58.860]  Live, broadcasting worldwide.
[2:59:58.860 --> 3:00:12.860]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:12.860 --> 3:00:16.940]  And unfiltered by the deep state scum.
[3:00:16.940 --> 3:00:20.860]  Born free and dying for the world.
[3:00:20.860 --> 3:00:23.300]  Free and dying free.
[3:00:23.300 --> 3:00:26.340]  This is America and the world awakening.
[3:00:26.340 --> 3:00:30.620]  This is your life, your decision.
[3:00:30.620 --> 3:00:32.460]  All right.
[3:00:32.460 --> 3:00:36.460]  Enrique Tario, Tario2020.com.
[3:00:36.460 --> 3:00:38.380]  I was about to say, everybody's got to run for office
[3:00:38.380 --> 3:00:39.860]  just for the bully pulpit.
[3:00:39.860 --> 3:00:43.460]  You get on TV locally, even if it's for low level positions.
[3:00:43.460 --> 3:00:45.180]  You get on national TV, other areas.
[3:00:45.180 --> 3:00:47.020]  And you just engage in the information war.
[3:00:47.020 --> 3:00:49.420]  And then a lot of times, you win.
[3:00:49.420 --> 3:00:52.100]  And they're so demonizing the proud boys as a terrorist group.
[3:00:52.100 --> 3:00:54.020]  None of that's true.
[3:00:54.020 --> 3:00:56.060]  That they're scared of America standing up and defending
[3:00:56.060 --> 3:00:58.900]  themselves with an anti-futile tax of men, women, and children.
[3:00:58.900 --> 3:01:01.220]  And so running for office is key.
[3:01:01.220 --> 3:01:03.740]  And then everybody getting out in the third dimension is key.
[3:01:03.740 --> 3:01:06.940]  And then realizing what an amazing blessing it
[3:01:06.940 --> 3:01:10.220]  is to do that and to experience that.
[3:01:10.220 --> 3:01:11.740]  And then Jacob was saying something too.
[3:01:11.740 --> 3:01:14.020]  It's important to get engaged and stop lying down.
[3:01:14.020 --> 3:01:15.580]  I agreed a violent globalist are the ones
[3:01:15.580 --> 3:01:16.580]  that know what they're doing.
[3:01:16.580 --> 3:01:21.380]  How do you, though, bridge that line or thread that needle
[3:01:21.380 --> 3:01:24.220]  where some of these leftists really are mentally retarded?
[3:01:24.220 --> 3:01:26.180]  And yeah, they're mean and vicious.
[3:01:26.180 --> 3:01:29.020]  But there's some way to ever reach out to them.
[3:01:29.020 --> 3:01:32.140]  So let's walk through that there in the short segment,
[3:01:32.140 --> 3:01:36.180]  longer segment coming up here in a moment.
[3:01:36.180 --> 3:01:38.300]  And the exciting news that a lot of proud boys are getting
[3:01:38.300 --> 3:01:39.380]  elected, tell us more about that.
[3:01:42.820 --> 3:01:44.780]  Like I said, it's a gift and a curse
[3:01:44.780 --> 3:01:46.180]  to be banned on social media.
[3:01:46.180 --> 3:01:49.340]  It gets you, it gets the energy going.
[3:01:49.340 --> 3:01:56.020]  It gets that true sense of compassion for our country.
[3:01:56.020 --> 3:02:02.500]  We need to stop sitting back on our computers
[3:02:02.500 --> 3:02:04.220]  and thinking that just hitting the share button
[3:02:04.220 --> 3:02:05.380]  does anything.
[3:02:05.380 --> 3:02:09.900]  And the proud boys are the example
[3:02:09.900 --> 3:02:12.900]  of what we do when we get banned on social media.
[3:02:12.900 --> 3:02:15.660]  I mean, this weekend with Governor Cuomo,
[3:02:15.660 --> 3:02:17.420]  it was 15 men and women.
[3:02:17.420 --> 3:02:19.900]  This included a group of the official group
[3:02:19.900 --> 3:02:21.860]  of Latinos for Trump there.
[3:02:21.860 --> 3:02:27.260]  And all the headlines were how small our numbers were.
[3:02:27.260 --> 3:02:32.020]  Well, 15 people made this huge difference in New York City,
[3:02:32.020 --> 3:02:37.180]  in this fascist state, where like it's showing on the TV
[3:02:37.180 --> 3:02:40.300]  where pedophiles get three month sentences
[3:02:40.300 --> 3:02:41.740]  and people for defending themselves
[3:02:41.740 --> 3:02:45.340]  get four years in prison.
[3:02:45.340 --> 3:02:47.460]  Those men did not deserve that.
[3:02:47.460 --> 3:02:50.540]  Those men did not deserve that.
[3:02:50.540 --> 3:02:53.780]  There was no victims in the trial.
[3:02:53.780 --> 3:02:59.380]  NYPD testified and testified with us that day.
[3:02:59.380 --> 3:03:01.860]  It's a travesty what happened to these guys.
[3:03:01.860 --> 3:03:04.540]  We're going to play the fray-dove video next segment,
[3:03:04.540 --> 3:03:07.580]  but that's like saying it was probably only 15 men.
[3:03:07.580 --> 3:03:08.860]  I think it was only 20-something.
[3:03:08.860 --> 3:03:11.340]  It was only 20-something men that started the Boston Tea
[3:03:11.340 --> 3:03:14.060]  Party and threw the tea over and then created the war that
[3:03:14.060 --> 3:03:15.860]  defeated the empire and no one had defeated and created
[3:03:15.860 --> 3:03:18.420]  the most powerful country in the world has ever seen that you
[3:03:18.420 --> 3:03:19.780]  invented almost everything.
[3:03:19.780 --> 3:03:22.860]  I mean, what did it do with 20-something people dressed up
[3:03:22.860 --> 3:03:24.980]  like Native Americans going on to a ship?
[3:03:24.980 --> 3:03:26.140]  What did that do?
[3:03:26.140 --> 3:03:27.180]  They said the same thing.
[3:03:27.180 --> 3:03:29.660]  They met at the Green Dragon and had beer, too.
[3:03:29.660 --> 3:03:32.020]  They were probably drunk when they did it.
[3:03:32.020 --> 3:03:32.620]  I mean, I love that.
[3:03:32.620 --> 3:03:33.580]  You're nobody.
[3:03:33.580 --> 3:03:38.300]  That's why they're trying so desperately to lock you all up.
[3:03:38.300 --> 3:03:40.260]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex.
[3:03:40.260 --> 3:03:42.780]  And one thing that I think we need to hit on
[3:03:42.780 --> 3:03:46.340]  is a lot of times they say, this is a small group of people.
[3:03:46.340 --> 3:03:49.100]  These are people who are Nazis or fascists.
[3:03:49.100 --> 3:03:52.260]  They always try and push into a corner where people say,
[3:03:52.260 --> 3:03:53.420]  oh, that's too controversial.
[3:03:53.420 --> 3:03:55.380]  Yeah, you're a small group of men that came out when they'd
[3:03:55.380 --> 3:03:57.700]  beat up any women and children at public events,
[3:03:57.700 --> 3:03:59.820]  and then you'd kick 100 of their asses when they attacked you.
[3:03:59.820 --> 3:04:00.420]  How horrible.
[3:04:00.420 --> 3:04:01.700]  You're a small group.
[3:04:01.700 --> 3:04:02.780]  How dare you do that?
[3:04:02.780 --> 3:04:04.980]  A few of the prouds standing up for freedom.
[3:04:04.980 --> 3:04:07.380]  How you lay down and take it.
[3:04:07.380 --> 3:04:09.700]  Lay down and take it, Enrique.
[3:04:09.700 --> 3:04:13.700]  Take it out, and I mean, I know that Jacob, you got beat up
[3:04:13.700 --> 3:04:16.140]  in New York just covering Roger Stone by Antifa,
[3:04:16.140 --> 3:04:17.180]  and the police did nothing.
[3:04:17.180 --> 3:04:19.100]  Bunch of them attacked you.
[3:04:19.100 --> 3:04:20.620]  Well, and that's the thing, Alex.
[3:04:20.620 --> 3:04:22.140]  These people don't see us as humans.
[3:04:22.140 --> 3:04:24.500]  So unless they know that we like the same music,
[3:04:24.500 --> 3:04:27.340]  we watch the same films, we same TV shows,
[3:04:27.340 --> 3:04:29.660]  read some of the same books, we have to humanize ourselves
[3:04:29.660 --> 3:04:31.620]  to them to the point where they can't ignore it.
[3:04:31.620 --> 3:04:34.620]  But yes, I was in DC covering Stone's trial,
[3:04:34.620 --> 3:04:37.420]  and this mob of rabid Antifa marched out
[3:04:37.420 --> 3:04:38.380]  in the middle of the street.
[3:04:38.380 --> 3:04:40.540]  I was just trying to get back into Trump Tower,
[3:04:40.540 --> 3:04:42.700]  and these people would not clear the road.
[3:04:42.700 --> 3:04:44.500]  So I finally just had the hell with it.
[3:04:44.500 --> 3:04:45.420]  Stay right there.
[3:04:45.420 --> 3:04:48.180]  We're going to be back on the other side with Jacob Engels,
[3:04:48.180 --> 3:04:50.460]  Enrique, and we've got Savannah right here as well.
[3:04:55.580 --> 3:04:58.740]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true,
[3:04:58.740 --> 3:05:00.540]  but I'm here to tell you that most of those really
[3:05:00.540 --> 3:05:04.780]  weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[3:05:04.780 --> 3:05:06.700]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[3:05:06.700 --> 3:05:11.340]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[3:05:11.340 --> 3:05:14.540]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed,
[3:05:14.540 --> 3:05:16.540]  that they were really setting the precedent
[3:05:16.540 --> 3:05:20.420]  to take everybody off air, to silence everyone,
[3:05:20.420 --> 3:05:24.580]  to ban words and names and information
[3:05:24.580 --> 3:05:28.220]  on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't
[3:05:28.220 --> 3:05:29.380]  be opposed.
[3:05:29.380 --> 3:05:31.380]  What the globalists really feared
[3:05:31.380 --> 3:05:35.300]  was independent media and platforms in the future.
[3:05:35.300 --> 3:05:38.900]  It was the model of InfoWars as much as the information that
[3:05:38.900 --> 3:05:42.780]  had to be silenced, because they need total information
[3:05:42.780 --> 3:05:44.940]  dominance for their outrageous lies
[3:05:44.940 --> 3:05:46.820]  and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[3:05:46.820 --> 3:05:49.100]  And that's why keeping InfoWars on the air
[3:05:49.100 --> 3:05:52.180]  is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[3:05:57.980 --> 3:06:01.180]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[3:06:01.180 --> 3:06:06.180]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[3:06:27.860 --> 3:06:30.860]  Andrew Cuomo is responding to acts of vandalism
[3:06:30.860 --> 3:06:34.140]  apparently at the hands of neo-fascist group.
[3:06:34.140 --> 3:06:37.300]  Protet of posters and banners with the CrowdBoys website
[3:06:37.300 --> 3:06:40.460]  were found on New York's and Bridges and Tunnels this morning.
[3:06:40.460 --> 3:06:42.700]  The banners included what the governor described
[3:06:42.700 --> 3:06:45.900]  as anti-Italian-American stereotypes of extremist
[3:06:45.900 --> 3:06:47.540]  right-wing propaganda.
[3:06:47.540 --> 3:06:49.500]  Governor Cuomo said, quote, New York
[3:06:49.500 --> 3:06:53.140]  is not intimidated or threatened by neo-fascists.
[3:06:53.140 --> 3:06:55.820]  Just last month, two members of the CrowdBoys group
[3:06:55.820 --> 3:07:01.820]  were sentenced to prison for violence that happened.
[3:07:26.820 --> 3:07:31.820]  Well, Fredo doesn't like this.
[3:07:35.820 --> 3:07:37.820]  Dub under Fredo.
[3:07:37.820 --> 3:07:39.820]  While these two innocent men are buying bars,
[3:07:39.820 --> 3:07:41.820]  CrowdBoys will return.
[3:07:41.820 --> 3:07:43.820]  Well done.
[3:07:43.820 --> 3:07:44.820]  You want war?
[3:07:44.820 --> 3:07:48.820]  Well, you've got one.
[3:07:48.820 --> 3:07:52.820]  Dedicated as political prisoners, Maxwell Hare and Tom
[3:07:52.820 --> 3:07:55.820]  Kingsman.
[3:07:55.820 --> 3:07:58.820]  I wonder what Kingsman's ancestors did, work for the king.
[3:07:58.820 --> 3:07:59.820]  There you go.
[3:07:59.820 --> 3:08:02.820]  And they're in jail for defending themselves.
[3:08:02.820 --> 3:08:04.820]  Fredo is a thug.
[3:08:04.820 --> 3:08:07.820]  He hit and ran at a public fair drunk.
[3:08:07.820 --> 3:08:10.820]  And they let him go because he's the governor's son.
[3:08:10.820 --> 3:08:12.820]  The video's up on infowars.com.
[3:08:12.820 --> 3:08:13.820]  Epic Video Proboys.
[3:08:13.820 --> 3:08:16.820]  Troll Fredo Cuomo in New York City.
[3:08:16.820 --> 3:08:18.820]  Savannah Hernandez, erotic shotgun.
[3:08:18.820 --> 3:08:22.820]  With Enrique Tario, the CrowdBoys, and Jacob Ingalls,
[3:08:22.820 --> 3:08:24.820]  who writes for a lot of big publications,
[3:08:24.820 --> 3:08:26.820]  including infowars.com, and of course,
[3:08:26.820 --> 3:08:28.820]  Confidant Roger Stone.
[3:08:28.820 --> 3:08:31.820]  Speaking of political prisoners, Enrique Savanna,
[3:08:31.820 --> 3:08:35.820]  and of course, Mr. Ingalls, this political persecution
[3:08:35.820 --> 3:08:38.820]  is getting out of control, and Trump needs to take action.
[3:08:38.820 --> 3:08:40.820]  I mean, everywhere I go in public, left us a woman
[3:08:40.820 --> 3:08:42.820]  and go, I can't wait to hear an effing prison.
[3:08:42.820 --> 3:08:45.820]  And thank God, the government took your time.
[3:08:45.820 --> 3:08:48.820]  I go, I didn't have my kids taken.
[3:08:48.820 --> 3:08:51.820]  Look, I mean, these are, they want my kids?
[3:08:51.820 --> 3:08:53.820]  They want me in jail?
[3:08:53.820 --> 3:08:55.820]  I mean, did I murder somebody?
[3:08:55.820 --> 3:08:57.820]  No, I love America.
[3:08:57.820 --> 3:08:59.820]  And so here's the key, and I want to ask you all about this.
[3:08:59.820 --> 3:09:03.820]  I love Mr. Tario, your shirt for Congress,
[3:09:03.820 --> 3:09:06.820]  how in the O, it's the Betsy Ross flag,
[3:09:06.820 --> 3:09:10.820]  an abolitionist who was trying to outlaw slavery.
[3:09:10.820 --> 3:09:13.820]  They almost did it in the first Constitution.
[3:09:13.820 --> 3:09:15.820]  England let it worldwide doing it.
[3:09:15.820 --> 3:09:17.820]  So England gets blamed for getting slavery banned,
[3:09:17.820 --> 3:09:19.820]  that they supposedly created it because they stopped it.
[3:09:19.820 --> 3:09:22.820]  Still going on in areas of Africa, but I'm ranting.
[3:09:22.820 --> 3:09:26.820]  The point is, is that the ADL came out with Nike, remember?
[3:09:26.820 --> 3:09:31.820]  And Nike got rid of the shoes that had the American flag on them
[3:09:31.820 --> 3:09:34.820]  because the original American flag scared Kaepernick.
[3:09:34.820 --> 3:09:37.820]  Well, the ADL's the private law center now say,
[3:09:37.820 --> 3:09:39.820]  you can't do the okay sign, which is international symbol
[3:09:39.820 --> 3:09:43.820]  for everything's good, underwater, military, you name it.
[3:09:43.820 --> 3:09:44.820]  Everybody knows that.
[3:09:44.820 --> 3:09:45.820]  Now it's the brofist.
[3:09:45.820 --> 3:09:48.820]  It just means, if anything, I think black folks kind of came up with that.
[3:09:48.820 --> 3:09:49.820]  Like, hey, let's not shake hands.
[3:09:49.820 --> 3:09:50.820]  Let's fist bump.
[3:09:50.820 --> 3:09:52.820]  I mean, I know that's where I learned it growing up in Dallas,
[3:09:52.820 --> 3:09:53.820]  was from black friends of mine.
[3:09:53.820 --> 3:09:54.820]  But it doesn't matter.
[3:09:54.820 --> 3:09:56.820]  The ADL knows that it's not bad.
[3:09:56.820 --> 3:09:57.820]  They know that, okay, symbol's not bad.
[3:09:57.820 --> 3:09:58.820]  They know the fist bump isn't bad.
[3:09:58.820 --> 3:10:00.820]  They know the Betsy Ross flag isn't bad.
[3:10:00.820 --> 3:10:04.820]  If they can shade those things or bad, they can ban anything.
[3:10:04.820 --> 3:10:08.820]  If you can ban the American flag and you can ban the American flag,
[3:10:08.820 --> 3:10:10.820]  then you can ban the okay symbol.
[3:10:10.820 --> 3:10:12.820]  You can ban a brofist or give me a brofist, Savannah.
[3:10:12.820 --> 3:10:14.820]  Look how evil we are right now.
[3:10:14.820 --> 3:10:16.820]  If you can do, you can ban anything.
[3:10:16.820 --> 3:10:18.820]  And I'm going to do a joke thing in the next few weeks.
[3:10:18.820 --> 3:10:19.820]  A satire.
[3:10:19.820 --> 3:10:22.820]  I'm going to say white supremacists are using the smiley face.
[3:10:22.820 --> 3:10:24.820]  ADL considering banning it.
[3:10:24.820 --> 3:10:27.820]  And then I'm going to say, and also the in and the alphabet offends
[3:10:27.820 --> 3:10:30.820]  because of the first letter of the unspoken word.
[3:10:30.820 --> 3:10:34.820]  And I bet it's picked up just like four-chance troll of the okay.
[3:10:34.820 --> 3:10:36.820]  And I bet they banned the letter M within one year.
[3:10:36.820 --> 3:10:37.820]  And I'm not joking.
[3:10:37.820 --> 3:10:40.820]  And let's just start because it's about banning language.
[3:10:40.820 --> 3:10:41.820]  Guys, you want to comment?
[3:10:41.820 --> 3:10:44.820]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[3:10:44.820 --> 3:10:46.820]  This is all about thought crimes.
[3:10:46.820 --> 3:10:48.820]  We're being prosecuted for thought crimes.
[3:10:48.820 --> 3:10:53.820]  We see that with Roger Stone.
[3:10:53.820 --> 3:10:59.820]  It's insane to me that a governor is involving himself
[3:10:59.820 --> 3:11:02.820]  with 15 people sitting on the street.
[3:11:02.820 --> 3:11:05.820]  And you said this before, you said this on the previous segment.
[3:11:05.820 --> 3:11:08.820]  You said that these people are victims.
[3:11:08.820 --> 3:11:11.820]  And that's very true.
[3:11:11.820 --> 3:11:15.820]  They actually believe that they're fighting this Nazi cause, right?
[3:11:15.820 --> 3:11:21.820]  Anti-Nazi cause where we had to get the FBI involved in this event
[3:11:21.820 --> 3:11:25.820]  in New York because of threats that we're getting online.
[3:11:25.820 --> 3:11:26.820]  They want to hurt us.
[3:11:26.820 --> 3:11:27.820]  They want to kill us.
[3:11:27.820 --> 3:11:30.820]  When you rolled around in the armored vehicle,
[3:11:30.820 --> 3:11:33.820]  what would happen to you if you got off that vehicle
[3:11:33.820 --> 3:11:37.820]  and you sat in that crowd for, I don't know, five minutes?
[3:11:37.820 --> 3:11:41.820]  I had, in that case, four security guys with me,
[3:11:41.820 --> 3:11:44.820]  all over the military, black water, everything.
[3:11:44.820 --> 3:11:46.820]  And they said they never see anything like it.
[3:11:46.820 --> 3:11:49.820]  I mean, I had hundreds of antifa run across the street in Dallas
[3:11:49.820 --> 3:11:50.820]  around me, started attacking me.
[3:11:50.820 --> 3:11:52.820]  And the police would not help us.
[3:11:52.820 --> 3:11:54.820]  We were just trying to get to the convention center.
[3:11:54.820 --> 3:11:56.820]  They would not let us get in the convention center.
[3:11:56.820 --> 3:11:59.820]  So yes, at first I rented the armored vehicle twice.
[3:11:59.820 --> 3:12:02.820]  I bought it now because I'm going to go all over the country again.
[3:12:02.820 --> 3:12:03.820]  And it's used.
[3:12:03.820 --> 3:12:04.820]  I got a good price on it.
[3:12:04.820 --> 3:12:07.820]  And literally, we've seen anti-events here in Austin
[3:12:07.820 --> 3:12:10.820]  at a Beto event where 500 antifa tried to surround us.
[3:12:10.820 --> 3:12:12.820]  The state police had to stop them.
[3:12:12.820 --> 3:12:14.820]  This way we can pull up and let them attack
[3:12:14.820 --> 3:12:17.820]  and show everyone what's happening in broadcast room inside
[3:12:17.820 --> 3:12:19.820]  and show the police stand down.
[3:12:19.820 --> 3:12:22.820]  In some jurisdictions like Austin, the state police were there.
[3:12:22.820 --> 3:12:23.820]  They did their job.
[3:12:23.820 --> 3:12:25.820]  Everywhere else, they stand down.
[3:12:25.820 --> 3:12:28.820]  Like in New York, they stood down and let them attack.
[3:12:28.820 --> 3:12:29.820]  And people defended themselves.
[3:12:29.820 --> 3:12:31.820]  They admit that you guys were attacked.
[3:12:31.820 --> 3:12:35.820]  Again, fighting back against a methhead leftist is an arch crime.
[3:12:35.820 --> 3:12:36.820]  Yeah.
[3:12:36.820 --> 3:12:38.820]  And I asked that same question I asked you.
[3:12:38.820 --> 3:12:40.820]  I asked that question to the journalists
[3:12:40.820 --> 3:12:42.820]  that were covering our side of the events.
[3:12:42.820 --> 3:12:45.820]  And I'm like, hey, what would happen if you guys go to the other side?
[3:12:45.820 --> 3:12:46.820]  And they just nodded.
[3:12:46.820 --> 3:12:48.820]  They're like, no, no, we're not going to go to this side.
[3:12:48.820 --> 3:12:49.820]  We're going to stay on this side.
[3:12:49.820 --> 3:12:53.820]  That shows you that we're not the violent group that the media portrays us as.
[3:12:53.820 --> 3:12:56.820]  And it shows, we saw this with Andy.
[3:12:56.820 --> 3:12:57.820]  No, we see this.
[3:12:57.820 --> 3:12:59.820]  We see this with Info Wars.
[3:12:59.820 --> 3:13:02.820]  You guys, we've seen journalists and activists.
[3:13:02.820 --> 3:13:09.820]  The acts of violence that are perpetrated against us for simply thinking differently.
[3:13:09.820 --> 3:13:10.820]  Right.
[3:13:10.820 --> 3:13:18.820]  Savannah Owen, yourself, when you go out there, you know, there's a chance that you might get,
[3:13:18.820 --> 3:13:21.820]  you might get killed by these people.
[3:13:21.820 --> 3:13:22.820]  You know, that's what they want to do.
[3:13:22.820 --> 3:13:23.820]  They want to kill you.
[3:13:23.820 --> 3:13:27.820]  They start by throwing milkshakes to humiliate you, silly string.
[3:13:27.820 --> 3:13:31.820]  And then they hit you over the top of the head like they're about to do with Andy.
[3:13:31.820 --> 3:13:32.820]  No, they throw milkshakes.
[3:13:32.820 --> 3:13:35.820]  They break windows, hammers, hammers at people.
[3:13:35.820 --> 3:13:38.820]  And I'm tired.
[3:13:38.820 --> 3:13:39.820]  Something needs to happen.
[3:13:39.820 --> 3:13:45.820]  These these guys need to get labeled as a domestic terrorist group.
[3:13:45.820 --> 3:13:46.820]  They need to happen.
[3:13:46.820 --> 3:13:51.820]  And that's one of the primary things that I'm going to do when I get elected to Congress.
[3:13:51.820 --> 3:13:56.820]  One of these things is fight these people back, put them behind bars, put them in prison,
[3:13:56.820 --> 3:13:58.820]  because that is where they belong.
[3:13:58.820 --> 3:13:59.820]  There are a bunch of animals.
[3:13:59.820 --> 3:14:00.820]  Look at this.
[3:14:00.820 --> 3:14:02.820]  I mean, this is this is nuts.
[3:14:02.820 --> 3:14:04.820]  This is America today.
[3:14:04.820 --> 3:14:06.820]  This is the left that the America wants.
[3:14:06.820 --> 3:14:08.820]  This is a future that they want.
[3:14:08.820 --> 3:14:09.820]  They want us to fear ourselves.
[3:14:09.820 --> 3:14:14.820]  But one thing I'm going to tell you, Alex, I am not going to sit here and allow this to happen.
[3:14:14.820 --> 3:14:15.820]  I'm going to keep going over there.
[3:14:15.820 --> 3:14:22.820]  And if Andrew Cuomo decides that he wants to jail people for simply for simply having
[3:14:22.820 --> 3:14:24.820]  a different thought than them, then you know what?
[3:14:24.820 --> 3:14:29.820]  I will keep going back and I will sit behind those bars happily because.
[3:14:29.820 --> 3:14:30.820]  Well, that's amazing.
[3:14:30.820 --> 3:14:31.820]  And that's how we got this country.
[3:14:31.820 --> 3:14:32.820]  People willing to stand for freedom.
[3:14:32.820 --> 3:14:34.820]  And let me, you brought up, and Ricky, we got to have you one more.
[3:14:34.820 --> 3:14:37.820]  I've been on many times, but you bring up so many really central points I haven't thought of.
[3:14:37.820 --> 3:14:38.820]  It's true.
[3:14:38.820 --> 3:14:42.820]  The media all over always goes to the conservative or nationalist or patriot side, even though
[3:14:42.820 --> 3:14:43.820]  they're attacking us.
[3:14:43.820 --> 3:14:47.820]  They'll never go with Antifa because the left in general, so vicious, they just attack
[3:14:47.820 --> 3:14:49.820]  people that don't look like zombies.
[3:14:49.820 --> 3:14:50.820]  They're just nasty people.
[3:14:50.820 --> 3:14:54.820]  They attack Savannah when she doesn't even have an inforce thing just because she doesn't
[3:14:54.820 --> 3:14:55.820]  look degenerate.
[3:14:55.820 --> 3:14:58.820]  They literally go, oh, you're pretty or you're well kept.
[3:14:58.820 --> 3:15:01.820]  You must be evil to start attacking because misery loves company.
[3:15:01.820 --> 3:15:02.820]  I mean, it's crazy.
[3:15:02.820 --> 3:15:04.820]  They are the baddies.
[3:15:04.820 --> 3:15:05.820]  Amazing.
[3:15:05.820 --> 3:15:08.820]  Mr. Ingalls, thanks for writing the story.
[3:15:08.820 --> 3:15:11.820]  Any other comments here at the end of this segment?
[3:15:11.820 --> 3:15:18.820]  Well, the crucial important point is they've dehumanized us to the point that they no longer
[3:15:18.820 --> 3:15:20.820]  view us as humans.
[3:15:20.820 --> 3:15:24.820]  Therefore, it starts with a milkshake, like Mr. Cario says, and it ends with a bolt.
[3:15:24.820 --> 3:15:25.820]  This is not a joke.
[3:15:25.820 --> 3:15:26.820]  This is not a gang.
[3:15:26.820 --> 3:15:30.820]  So if you're a patriot, if you're an info warrior, if you're someone that's out there,
[3:15:30.820 --> 3:15:31.820]  keep yourself safe.
[3:15:31.820 --> 3:15:33.820]  Traveling groups, don't get caught alone.
[3:15:33.820 --> 3:15:40.820]  Because when I got caught alone in DC and had a rabid mob of lesbian feminazis spitting
[3:15:40.820 --> 3:15:45.820]  in my face like dinosaurs and then punching me instead of wiping the spit out of my face,
[3:15:45.820 --> 3:15:46.820]  it's insane.
[3:15:46.820 --> 3:15:48.820]  And no one was there to help you, folks.
[3:15:48.820 --> 3:15:50.820]  First they deplatform you, then they imprison you.
[3:15:50.820 --> 3:16:19.820]  God bless you, great job everybody.
[3:16:20.820 --> 3:16:47.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:16:47.820 --> 3:17:13.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:17:13.820 --> 3:17:42.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:17:42.820 --> 3:18:11.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:18:11.820 --> 3:18:40.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:18:40.820 --> 3:19:06.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:19:06.820 --> 3:19:35.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:19:36.820 --> 3:20:00.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:20:06.820 --> 3:20:33.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:20:33.820 --> 3:20:59.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:20:59.820 --> 3:21:28.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:21:28.820 --> 3:21:55.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:21:55.820 --> 3:22:21.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:22:21.820 --> 3:22:50.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:22:50.820 --> 3:23:19.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:23:19.820 --> 3:23:45.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:23:45.820 --> 3:24:14.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:24:14.820 --> 3:24:41.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:24:41.820 --> 3:25:08.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:25:08.820 --> 3:25:35.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:25:35.820 --> 3:26:04.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:26:05.820 --> 3:26:28.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:26:28.820 --> 3:26:54.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:26:54.820 --> 3:27:22.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:27:22.820 --> 3:27:51.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:27:51.820 --> 3:28:18.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:28:18.820 --> 3:28:44.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:28:44.820 --> 3:29:11.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:29:11.820 --> 3:29:40.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:29:41.820 --> 3:30:08.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:30:08.820 --> 3:30:35.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:30:35.820 --> 3:31:04.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:31:04.820 --> 3:31:31.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:31:31.820 --> 3:31:53.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:31:53.820 --> 3:32:22.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:32:22.820 --> 3:32:51.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:32:51.820 --> 3:33:20.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:33:21.820 --> 3:33:48.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:33:48.820 --> 3:34:17.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:34:17.820 --> 3:34:44.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:34:44.820 --> 3:35:11.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:35:11.820 --> 3:35:39.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:35:39.820 --> 3:36:05.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:36:05.820 --> 3:36:31.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:36:31.820 --> 3:36:58.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:36:58.820 --> 3:37:25.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:37:28.820 --> 3:37:54.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:37:54.820 --> 3:38:21.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:38:21.820 --> 3:38:48.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:38:48.820 --> 3:39:17.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:39:18.820 --> 3:39:47.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:39:47.820 --> 3:40:14.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:40:14.820 --> 3:40:43.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:40:43.820 --> 3:41:10.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:41:10.820 --> 3:41:37.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:41:37.820 --> 3:42:05.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:42:05.820 --> 3:42:34.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:42:34.820 --> 3:42:53.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:42:53.820 --> 3:43:20.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:43:20.820 --> 3:43:47.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:43:47.820 --> 3:44:14.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:44:14.820 --> 3:44:43.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:44:43.820 --> 3:45:12.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:45:13.820 --> 3:45:42.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:45:43.820 --> 3:46:12.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:46:13.820 --> 3:46:42.820]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:46:43.820 --> 3:47:12.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:12.820 --> 3:47:17.820]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[3:47:17.820 --> 3:47:20.820]  It's Nick Baggage.
[3:47:20.820 --> 3:47:29.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:29.820 --> 3:47:31.820]  And welcome back.
[3:47:31.820 --> 3:47:33.820]  And thank you for being here this Friday afternoon.
[3:47:33.820 --> 3:47:35.820]  You know, talking about corruption,
[3:47:35.820 --> 3:47:37.820]  corruption of words and the word games
[3:47:37.820 --> 3:47:39.820]  that are being played right now.
[3:47:39.820 --> 3:47:42.820]  And the important aspect of all of it is to kind of break through
[3:47:42.820 --> 3:47:45.820]  the fog and try and sort out the facts from the fiction.
[3:47:45.820 --> 3:47:49.820]  And I want to make a couple of, let's just assume that
[3:47:49.820 --> 3:47:54.820]  Donald Trump's team did want Biden investigated.
[3:47:54.820 --> 3:47:58.820]  Well, why not if he broke the law?
[3:47:58.820 --> 3:48:00.820]  Shouldn't he be investigated?
[3:48:00.820 --> 3:48:02.820]  Or should he be insulated?
[3:48:02.820 --> 3:48:04.820]  Insulated or investigated?
[3:48:04.820 --> 3:48:07.820]  Pretty good question for the public, actually.
[3:48:07.820 --> 3:48:10.820]  When it comes to Americans in other countries,
[3:48:10.820 --> 3:48:15.820]  actually, the law does extend where one of the countries,
[3:48:15.820 --> 3:48:19.820]  one of the few countries where our anti-corruption laws
[3:48:19.820 --> 3:48:21.820]  bind you as an American citizen,
[3:48:21.820 --> 3:48:25.820]  no matter where in the world you travel, you see,
[3:48:25.820 --> 3:48:28.820]  because that is the law of this land.
[3:48:28.820 --> 3:48:33.820]  And so if, in fact, there was corruption involved,
[3:48:33.820 --> 3:48:35.820]  it ought to be looked at.
[3:48:35.820 --> 3:48:39.820]  Well, I don't think asking someone to investigate corruption
[3:48:39.820 --> 3:48:41.820]  is corruption.
[3:48:41.820 --> 3:48:46.820]  I think it's the right thing to do, actually.
[3:48:46.820 --> 3:48:49.820]  And I don't think they were necessarily withholding anything.
[3:48:49.820 --> 3:48:52.820]  I think Donald Trump withholds all foreign aid
[3:48:52.820 --> 3:48:57.820]  until he figures out why is it in America's best interest?
[3:48:57.820 --> 3:48:59.820]  And he listens to everybody,
[3:48:59.820 --> 3:49:02.820]  and it might take a little bit of time.
[3:49:02.820 --> 3:49:04.820]  And at the end of that, he makes a decision.
[3:49:04.820 --> 3:49:06.820]  Because that's what he ought to do,
[3:49:06.820 --> 3:49:11.820]  and not just believe these career bureaucrats on face.
[3:49:11.820 --> 3:49:14.820]  But listen carefully, analyze carefully,
[3:49:14.820 --> 3:49:17.820]  and make your own judgment as President of the United States.
[3:49:17.820 --> 3:49:21.820]  And you know, sometimes the other team doesn't like
[3:49:21.820 --> 3:49:24.820]  what you decide, and that's why there is another team.
[3:49:24.820 --> 3:49:27.820]  But this team is the one in charge right now.
[3:49:27.820 --> 3:49:29.820]  And people are mad at Donald Trump,
[3:49:29.820 --> 3:49:32.820]  and really what I saw in those video clips in the last hour
[3:49:32.820 --> 3:49:36.820]  were people who are angry because he behaves badly.
[3:49:36.820 --> 3:49:38.820]  And he does in a lot of ways.
[3:49:38.820 --> 3:49:41.820]  He's got a personality that rubs a lot of people the wrong way.
[3:49:41.820 --> 3:49:45.820]  He's not someone that you might bring home to your mother for dinner
[3:49:45.820 --> 3:49:48.820]  and expect a polite conversation all the time.
[3:49:48.820 --> 3:49:51.820]  But I think Donald Trump says what's on his mind.
[3:49:51.820 --> 3:49:54.820]  And sometimes it comes out in a crass way,
[3:49:54.820 --> 3:49:57.820]  and that's who he is, for goodness sake.
[3:49:57.820 --> 3:49:59.820]  And everybody knew it when they elect him.
[3:49:59.820 --> 3:50:03.820]  The same people angry about his behavior are still angry,
[3:50:03.820 --> 3:50:07.820]  but his words are clear, and he expects performance.
[3:50:07.820 --> 3:50:09.820]  And NATO, NATO is dancing around
[3:50:09.820 --> 3:50:12.820]  because they're not carrying their weight in Ukraine.
[3:50:12.820 --> 3:50:13.820]  We are.
[3:50:13.820 --> 3:50:18.820]  And NATO needs to buckle up in Ukraine and in all of Europe
[3:50:18.820 --> 3:50:21.820]  where their interests, if they feel their interests, are at stake
[3:50:21.820 --> 3:50:25.820]  and start paying the bill that America has been paying.
[3:50:25.820 --> 3:50:28.820]  And Donald Trump is not happy about that either.
[3:50:28.820 --> 3:50:32.820]  So he's asking all these groups of people, these networks,
[3:50:32.820 --> 3:50:36.820]  the European Parliament's ambassador to listen to all the BS
[3:50:36.820 --> 3:50:38.820]  from the European Union,
[3:50:38.820 --> 3:50:41.820]  and then he needs to get the input from NATO
[3:50:41.820 --> 3:50:44.820]  and listen to all the BS from the NATO partners
[3:50:44.820 --> 3:50:47.820]  who don't pay their share as good partners might.
[3:50:47.820 --> 3:50:50.820]  You know, they're not partners.
[3:50:50.820 --> 3:50:55.820]  They've become parasites driving the international agenda
[3:50:55.820 --> 3:50:58.820]  for the United States. Is that how it goes?
[3:50:58.820 --> 3:51:00.820]  I don't think so.
[3:51:00.820 --> 3:51:05.820]  As for a globalist agenda, yeah, there actually is one.
[3:51:05.820 --> 3:51:08.820]  And it is real.
[3:51:08.820 --> 3:51:11.820]  And now because of the global internet
[3:51:11.820 --> 3:51:13.820]  and the global network of communications
[3:51:13.820 --> 3:51:16.820]  and the global system of banking
[3:51:16.820 --> 3:51:18.820]  through the SWIFT system,
[3:51:18.820 --> 3:51:21.820]  you can control the whole ballgame.
[3:51:21.820 --> 3:51:24.820]  And they want to go to a digital currency.
[3:51:24.820 --> 3:51:27.820]  This Bitcoin thing is to test it
[3:51:27.820 --> 3:51:30.820]  because Bitcoin is a traceable thing
[3:51:30.820 --> 3:51:32.820]  if you really think about it,
[3:51:32.820 --> 3:51:36.820]  because you can follow the chain, you see.
[3:51:36.820 --> 3:51:40.820]  Currency is going to be Bitcoin kind of thing one day,
[3:51:40.820 --> 3:51:42.820]  a digital matrix.
[3:51:42.820 --> 3:51:44.820]  It's happening, the discussion even in Germany
[3:51:44.820 --> 3:51:47.820]  as we're talking today.
[3:51:47.820 --> 3:51:49.820]  Because people taking their money out of banks
[3:51:49.820 --> 3:51:51.820]  because they have a negative interest rate.
[3:51:51.820 --> 3:51:53.820]  They charge you for banking your money,
[3:51:53.820 --> 3:51:55.820]  so a lot of big companies bought big safes
[3:51:55.820 --> 3:51:58.820]  and moved about a lot of cash into vaults.
[3:51:58.820 --> 3:52:00.820]  Well, they don't like that.
[3:52:00.820 --> 3:52:04.820]  So they want to use a digital currency in Germany.
[3:52:04.820 --> 3:52:06.820]  So you can't do that.
[3:52:06.820 --> 3:52:08.820]  So you've got to pay the negative interest rates
[3:52:08.820 --> 3:52:11.820]  to keep your money in their system
[3:52:11.820 --> 3:52:14.820]  as a little digital entry that can be
[3:52:14.820 --> 3:52:16.820]  blipped out of existence.
[3:52:16.820 --> 3:52:19.820]  And then on gold in Europe and Germany,
[3:52:19.820 --> 3:52:23.820]  now if you buy a thousand euros, excuse me,
[3:52:23.820 --> 3:52:26.820]  of gold less than an ounce, it has to be recorded
[3:52:26.820 --> 3:52:28.820]  because one day they're going to tax gold in the vault,
[3:52:28.820 --> 3:52:30.820]  I'll guarantee, or they're going to take it
[3:52:30.820 --> 3:52:33.820]  like they did in the U.S. and other places in the 30s.
[3:52:33.820 --> 3:52:36.820]  Then you see a run on gold by central bankers
[3:52:36.820 --> 3:52:38.820]  starting to accumulate it, small countries,
[3:52:38.820 --> 3:52:40.820]  big countries alike.
[3:52:40.820 --> 3:52:42.820]  Why is that?
[3:52:42.820 --> 3:52:44.820]  Well, stop and think about it.
[3:52:44.820 --> 3:52:47.820]  You think these people don't know what's coming?
[3:52:47.820 --> 3:52:51.820]  They are what's coming for goodness sake.
[3:52:51.820 --> 3:52:54.820]  And the propaganda wars, the info wars,
[3:52:54.820 --> 3:52:58.820]  where this network started, info wars,
[3:52:58.820 --> 3:53:00.820]  wars on for your mind, right?
[3:53:00.820 --> 3:53:03.820]  And where I started now 25 years ago
[3:53:03.820 --> 3:53:05.820]  was changing the way we see the world
[3:53:05.820 --> 3:53:07.820]  because I thought we could see a little bit differently,
[3:53:07.820 --> 3:53:08.820]  maybe change it.
[3:53:08.820 --> 3:53:11.820]  And I think we can, I still think we can,
[3:53:11.820 --> 3:53:15.820]  after a quarter century of watching a lot of degradation.
[3:53:15.820 --> 3:53:17.820]  And before the break, the last break,
[3:53:17.820 --> 3:53:21.820]  this reminded me of when Ross Perot ran for president
[3:53:21.820 --> 3:53:24.820]  and the establishment was really uptight.
[3:53:24.820 --> 3:53:28.820]  And they took out all the stops to beat this man up
[3:53:28.820 --> 3:53:31.820]  and his family in any way they could get to him
[3:53:31.820 --> 3:53:34.820]  until they diminished his ability to run.
[3:53:34.820 --> 3:53:37.820]  And at that time, there was a broadcaster
[3:53:37.820 --> 3:53:38.820]  that some of you will remember.
[3:53:38.820 --> 3:53:40.820]  It was Chuck Carter, now deceased.
[3:53:40.820 --> 3:53:43.820]  And someone reminded me of him this week, a listener.
[3:53:43.820 --> 3:53:46.820]  And Chuck, Chuck was a consumer advocate,
[3:53:46.820 --> 3:53:47.820]  started out that way
[3:53:47.820 --> 3:53:49.820]  and then became a little bit more political
[3:53:49.820 --> 3:53:51.820]  because he realized that's where the action was
[3:53:51.820 --> 3:53:52.820]  if you really want to change the world.
[3:53:52.820 --> 3:53:56.820]  But he was a nonprofit which limited his political speech.
[3:53:56.820 --> 3:53:57.820]  A lot of people don't know this,
[3:53:57.820 --> 3:53:59.820]  but if you're a nonprofit,
[3:53:59.820 --> 3:54:01.820]  people can donate to you and give you money.
[3:54:01.820 --> 3:54:03.820]  You don't get political speech.
[3:54:03.820 --> 3:54:05.820]  501c3 is no way, man.
[3:54:05.820 --> 3:54:06.820]  You start speaking politically.
[3:54:06.820 --> 3:54:08.820]  They send an auditor into your place,
[3:54:08.820 --> 3:54:10.820]  which they did to Chuck for three years.
[3:54:10.820 --> 3:54:13.820]  They had an auditor from the IRS sitting in his office
[3:54:13.820 --> 3:54:16.820]  for three years, right?
[3:54:16.820 --> 3:54:17.820]  Think about that.
[3:54:17.820 --> 3:54:20.820]  And then he got a little financial stretch
[3:54:20.820 --> 3:54:21.820]  because he grew so fast
[3:54:21.820 --> 3:54:23.820]  because people really liked what he was doing
[3:54:23.820 --> 3:54:25.820]  and liked the alternative news he was providing.
[3:54:25.820 --> 3:54:29.820]  And it gave us a different view of the world
[3:54:29.820 --> 3:54:31.820]  that was needed back then.
[3:54:31.820 --> 3:54:34.820]  And when I remember listening to Chuck,
[3:54:34.820 --> 3:54:37.820]  he had a huge network, you know, big network,
[3:54:37.820 --> 3:54:39.820]  and they did everything to diminish it.
[3:54:39.820 --> 3:54:40.820]  They came in the back door.
[3:54:40.820 --> 3:54:43.820]  They came in, they financed his program,
[3:54:43.820 --> 3:54:45.820]  got him obligated,
[3:54:45.820 --> 3:54:47.820]  and then he lost his editorial voice
[3:54:47.820 --> 3:54:50.820]  at a certain point when the cash flow dropped
[3:54:50.820 --> 3:54:53.820]  and he was stuck.
[3:54:53.820 --> 3:54:54.820]  And then he was done.
[3:54:54.820 --> 3:54:56.820]  And then they wiped him out.
[3:54:56.820 --> 3:55:00.820]  And he passed, I'm sure,
[3:55:00.820 --> 3:55:03.820]  not a broken man because he did make the difference.
[3:55:03.820 --> 3:55:05.820]  And the fire in his voice still echoes
[3:55:05.820 --> 3:55:08.820]  in the voice of all of us who remember him
[3:55:08.820 --> 3:55:10.820]  and still talk about the fact
[3:55:10.820 --> 3:55:12.820]  that that was about making change then
[3:55:12.820 --> 3:55:14.820]  and this is about making change now,
[3:55:14.820 --> 3:55:17.820]  a quarter of a century later.
[3:55:17.820 --> 3:55:19.820]  And it's the same game,
[3:55:19.820 --> 3:55:23.820]  but the difference is this time there was an info wars
[3:55:23.820 --> 3:55:25.820]  that had a broader network, a bigger network,
[3:55:25.820 --> 3:55:29.820]  a network that couldn't be stifled out of existence.
[3:55:29.820 --> 3:55:31.820]  And it maintained its independence
[3:55:31.820 --> 3:55:34.820]  because you listeners supported this network
[3:55:34.820 --> 3:55:35.820]  and continued to do so.
[3:55:35.820 --> 3:55:37.820]  So there could be a free voice still
[3:55:37.820 --> 3:55:38.820]  in the game.
[3:55:38.820 --> 3:55:41.820]  And yes, it had a big influence on Donald Trump's election.
[3:55:41.820 --> 3:55:42.820]  It'll probably have a big influence
[3:55:42.820 --> 3:55:44.820]  on whoever wins the next election.
[3:55:44.820 --> 3:55:47.820]  But I can say this about that,
[3:55:47.820 --> 3:55:50.820]  is if it's coming out of Washington and DC,
[3:55:50.820 --> 3:55:52.820]  it's coming out of a swamp.
[3:55:52.820 --> 3:55:54.820]  Let me give you some other examples of corruption.
[3:55:54.820 --> 3:55:59.820]  Real estate deal, stock insider information.
[3:55:59.820 --> 3:56:01.820]  How about gambling?
[3:56:01.820 --> 3:56:03.820]  Playing poker with the lobbyist
[3:56:03.820 --> 3:56:06.820]  and the lobbyist always loses even on a full house
[3:56:06.820 --> 3:56:07.820]  or four aces.
[3:56:07.820 --> 3:56:10.820]  How does that all happen?
[3:56:10.820 --> 3:56:13.820]  How about book deal?
[3:56:13.820 --> 3:56:14.820]  Big advances.
[3:56:14.820 --> 3:56:15.820]  Baltimore right now.
[3:56:15.820 --> 3:56:17.820]  Children's book written by the mayor.
[3:56:17.820 --> 3:56:19.820]  Oh, why do people buy underground
[3:56:19.820 --> 3:56:21.820]  whether with children's book?
[3:56:21.820 --> 3:56:23.820]  Give me a break.
[3:56:23.820 --> 3:56:25.820]  A lot of that does happen that way.
[3:56:25.820 --> 3:56:26.820]  I got to tell you.
[3:56:26.820 --> 3:56:29.820]  And look at the boards,
[3:56:29.820 --> 3:56:31.820]  look at who's doing the decision making
[3:56:31.820 --> 3:56:34.820]  in these decisions and then ask yourself,
[3:56:34.820 --> 3:56:37.820]  and how do we combat that as Americans?
[3:56:37.820 --> 3:56:39.820]  What do we do with all of that?
[3:56:39.820 --> 3:56:42.820]  And then you've got Pelosi talking about
[3:56:42.820 --> 3:56:45.820]  creating news out of thin air
[3:56:45.820 --> 3:56:47.820]  and making it policy.
[3:56:47.820 --> 3:56:50.820]  I mean, are we going to go forward
[3:56:50.820 --> 3:56:52.820]  in this country and in the world
[3:56:52.820 --> 3:56:56.820]  creating policy based upon BS
[3:56:56.820 --> 3:56:59.820]  that someone wants us to consider fertilizer?
[3:56:59.820 --> 3:57:03.820]  This isn't the America that I grew up in
[3:57:03.820 --> 3:57:05.820]  and one that I don't want my grandchildren
[3:57:05.820 --> 3:57:07.820]  or my great grandchildren growing up in
[3:57:07.820 --> 3:57:09.820]  without knowing the truth about it.
[3:57:09.820 --> 3:57:11.820]  And the truth is,
[3:57:11.820 --> 3:57:14.820]  our words are what sets us apart
[3:57:14.820 --> 3:57:15.820]  and sets us free.
[3:57:15.820 --> 3:57:18.820]  And we don't have to agree with those words.
[3:57:18.820 --> 3:57:20.820]  We can change the channel.
[3:57:20.820 --> 3:57:22.820]  But what's important in this country
[3:57:22.820 --> 3:57:24.820]  and in favor of liberty
[3:57:24.820 --> 3:57:26.820]  and the pursuit of happiness
[3:57:26.820 --> 3:57:28.820]  and all things that we hold dear
[3:57:28.820 --> 3:57:32.820]  is a free voice because it is in the word
[3:57:32.820 --> 3:57:34.820]  that things change.
[3:57:34.820 --> 3:57:37.820]  It is in the word that the world is changed
[3:57:37.820 --> 3:57:39.820]  and it's through info wars
[3:57:39.820 --> 3:58:03.820]  that we're all hip of the spear.
