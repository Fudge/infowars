[00:00.000 --> 00:12.640]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence,
[00:12.640 --> 00:17.560]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[00:17.560 --> 00:22.480]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[00:22.480 --> 00:23.480]  Dallas.
[00:23.480 --> 00:29.520]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:29.520 --> 00:34.520]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[00:34.520 --> 00:43.520]  It was almost as if it were planned in motion, it's just pancake.
[00:43.520 --> 00:49.520]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:49.520 --> 01:05.280]  But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers
[01:05.280 --> 01:07.280]  not in the hands of criminals.
[01:07.280 --> 01:14.440]  Guns will be taken, no one will be able to be off, it will take all of you.
[01:14.440 --> 01:18.840]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[01:18.840 --> 01:19.840]  city.
[01:19.840 --> 01:23.560]  Global governance at last is at one world, the central bank is in charge.
[01:23.560 --> 01:27.280]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:27.280 --> 01:33.400]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:33.400 --> 01:39.840]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:39.840 --> 01:48.240]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com in El Paso, Texas, right across the border from Juarez,
[01:48.240 --> 01:53.880]  where there are reports of an imminent threat and attack by the ISIS terrorist group, which
[01:53.880 --> 01:57.640]  we all know is funded by the CIA.
[01:57.640 --> 02:02.880]  Now there are reports that they've heard some chatter over the radio that the threat
[02:02.880 --> 02:09.800]  could be a VBIED, and what that is is a vehicle-borne, improvised explosive device, a driver gets
[02:09.800 --> 02:15.920]  in the vehicle, drives it into his target, and it flattens the place out completely.
[02:15.920 --> 02:22.120]  Now is this a false flag to stage a reason to take our liberties away?
[02:22.120 --> 02:28.160]  We saw how quickly things went to hell and a martial law status was in place in Ferguson.
[02:28.160 --> 02:29.640]  Don't forget about that.
[02:29.640 --> 02:37.240]  Or is this an actual threat, a legitimate threat by ISIS on our southern borders?
[02:37.240 --> 02:41.200]  So this is something you need to think about, and I encourage the people watching this to
[02:41.200 --> 02:44.760]  comment on this at the bottom of the video on YouTube.
[02:44.760 --> 02:49.480]  But let me get back to another thing, if this is an actual legitimate threat, and it can
[02:49.480 --> 02:56.120]  be because one of the reasons El Paso Fort Bliss this weekend shut down a lot of its
[02:56.120 --> 03:02.920]  main gates and only left them open for personnel with DOD cat cards, I think it's a white
[03:02.920 --> 03:09.640]  Army ID that has a chip in it, has all their information on that, and then also all the
[03:09.640 --> 03:16.440]  vehicles were subject to being searched by the MPs at the gates of dogs, looking for
[03:16.440 --> 03:19.160]  stuff like that explosive, things of that nature.
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.200]  So they've definitely taken that threat to be a serious threat and they've heightened
[03:23.200 --> 03:24.920]  their security.
[03:24.920 --> 03:29.040]  So that kind of adds a little bit of legitimacy to the threat.
[03:29.040 --> 03:34.040]  Now another thing as well though, if this is a real threat, well the Democrats take
[03:34.040 --> 03:39.880]  the blame because they have done nothing to help secure our borders whatsoever.
[03:39.880 --> 03:46.500]  We're spending $30 million on getting these huge Border Patrol facilities built, meanwhile
[03:46.500 --> 03:49.440]  behind me is a gate that's been left open.
[03:49.440 --> 03:52.800]  We've seen it, you've seen the video, it's a viral video.
[03:52.800 --> 03:57.360]  Now this is a main gate right off of I-10, but literally just around the corner over
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.920]  here is a small place that I'm going to take us to tomorrow, and you can see you can walk
[04:01.920 --> 04:06.480]  right across the river, it's right on the US and Mexico border right there, it's not
[04:06.480 --> 04:07.480]  that hard.
[04:07.480 --> 04:11.600]  People watch these videos like, oh, it'd be so hard, no it's not.
[04:11.600 --> 04:13.680]  Stop playing around with yourself.
[04:13.680 --> 04:16.480]  This is a serious, serious issue.
[04:16.480 --> 04:23.240]  And it's funny, the borders are weak, there's ISIS supposedly, NWAR is right now wanting
[04:23.240 --> 04:30.440]  to incite violence and take out targets on American soil, that's a pretty legitimate
[04:30.440 --> 04:34.000]  threat, even if it doesn't happen, that's still something that you should take seriously.
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.640]  And if there is an actual attack that really happens on our American soil right here in
[04:39.640 --> 04:45.520]  a border town like El Paso, you know only a matter of time they will use that to take
[04:45.520 --> 04:46.520]  away our liberties.
[04:46.520 --> 04:52.560]  There will be martial law up and down throughout the country and every small American city
[04:52.560 --> 04:55.440]  and then it's going to move to everything, tanks up and down the street.
[04:55.440 --> 05:00.960]  Joe Biggs in El Paso, he's coming up live, stay with us.
[05:00.960 --> 05:06.120]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and

[05:33.960 --> 05:34.960]  else what happened?
[05:34.960 --> 05:39.720]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[05:39.720 --> 05:40.720]  Talk about the effects.
[05:40.720 --> 05:44.760]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning, I have drive to go to the gym, I feel like
[05:44.760 --> 05:48.400]  I look better, I feel better, I feel sexier, I love it.

[06:01.200 --> 06:02.200]  In the near future.
[06:02.200 --> 06:09.360]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball, security, alert, this is Homeland
[06:09.360 --> 06:13.680]  Security, analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[06:13.680 --> 06:18.840]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[06:18.840 --> 06:21.640]  Prime Directed, discredit Alex Jones.
[06:21.640 --> 06:24.200]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[06:24.200 --> 06:27.520]  It's a popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[06:27.520 --> 06:29.720]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[06:29.720 --> 06:31.520]  These people are assaulting us.
[06:31.520 --> 06:33.520]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[06:33.520 --> 06:38.600]  They are never going to stop, they're never going to deviate from their program until
[06:38.600 --> 06:40.120]  we stop them.
[06:40.120 --> 06:48.000]  Block Free Iphone Act at infowars.com, block free podcast and video feed, Imperatives,
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  Detroit, Riverland and TV.
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.520]  You got a censor eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out, get electrically,
[06:55.520 --> 07:00.320]  it's for God you can fail it.
[07:00.320 --> 07:04.600]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has
[07:04.600 --> 07:06.440]  been told not to drink the water.
[07:06.440 --> 07:09.080]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[07:09.080 --> 07:14.760]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[07:14.760 --> 07:16.080]  single day?
[07:16.080 --> 07:19.080]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[07:19.080 --> 07:22.000]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.960]  Well here at a supermarket in Toledo you can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[07:26.960 --> 07:32.880]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe clean water.
[07:32.880 --> 07:36.080]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[07:36.080 --> 07:39.280]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[08:25.480 --> 08:26.480]  Alex Jones.
[08:26.480 --> 08:27.480]  Thank you for joining us.
[08:27.480 --> 08:45.280]  It is already the third day of September 2014 on this Wednesday Worldwide edition.
[08:45.280 --> 08:54.440]  We're going to be joined coming up at the bottom of the next hour by Joe Biggs and some
[08:54.440 --> 09:01.120]  of our other reporters that are on the ground in El Paso, Texas where Homeland Security
[09:01.120 --> 09:09.440]  last Friday and again on Monday said that a terror attack is imminent and that it is
[09:09.440 --> 09:13.360]  specific targets like Fort Bliss.
[09:13.360 --> 09:19.360]  Now whether this is real or more hyped so that Homeland Security can grab more of our
[09:19.360 --> 09:26.720]  civil liberties and freedoms isn't even an issue because the border is wide open.
[09:26.720 --> 09:33.080]  We have video of the border fences a month ago, two weeks ago and last night wide open.
[09:33.080 --> 09:36.320]  They actually open the gates at night.
[09:36.320 --> 09:39.000]  People just pour it back into the floor or through them whenever they want.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.240]  It's a giant facade.
[09:40.240 --> 09:44.080]  It's a giant joke.
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.800]  We noticed this about a year ago.
[09:45.800 --> 09:48.760]  We pointed it out in news reports about six months ago.
[09:48.760 --> 09:56.480]  Two weeks ago the actual training manual for TSA came out admitting in the memo that they
[09:56.480 --> 10:05.240]  had been told for years to let illegals fly with no ID.
[10:05.240 --> 10:12.040]  But citizens get their reserves grubbed, naked body scans, your genitals grubbed, your children
[10:12.040 --> 10:22.440]  grubbed, your shoes off, jackets off, shoes off, all to train you that the state is God
[10:22.440 --> 10:24.800]  and that you're a prisoner.
[10:24.800 --> 10:28.480]  It's beyond security theater.
[10:28.480 --> 10:33.320]  And as much as I bash the individual TSA minions, most of them just want a job.
[10:33.320 --> 10:36.600]  Some of them are on power trips, obviously that's come out over and over again and a
[10:36.600 --> 10:48.160]  lot of them want to rob the bags and the rest of it, the people that are behind it are our
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.840]  Congress and the special interest that control them and all over the world this type of thing
[10:52.840 --> 10:58.840]  is going on in an attempt to train law abiding citizens that they are basically prisoners.
[10:58.840 --> 11:04.000]  This is an induction into tyranny.
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.480]  So Joe Biggs coming up in an hour, about 20 minutes from now from El Paso, he was stationed
[11:09.480 --> 11:10.480]  there for a while.
[11:10.480 --> 11:19.720]  He has a lot of sources there at the military base and we have ICE and board patrol sources
[11:19.720 --> 11:24.480]  obviously high up in the board patrol they've been on the show but since they've been given
[11:24.480 --> 11:32.600]  gag orders, basically threatened with arrest if they speak out about the admitted treason
[11:32.600 --> 11:39.600]  and how the board patrol is there now to complete the cycle of human smuggling close quote.
[11:39.600 --> 11:45.560]  Think about how epically over the top that is that Obama is in the news saying I'm not
[11:45.560 --> 11:49.840]  doing immigration reform right now and Boehner is in the news saying he's not going to do
[11:49.840 --> 11:56.240]  immigration reform right now until next year and that it's a great idea and that this is
[11:56.240 --> 12:04.760]  a wonderful reform, Republican and Democratic leadership working together.
[12:04.760 --> 12:11.680]  Meanwhile, they've already basically legalized all of the illegals by fiat between three
[12:11.680 --> 12:18.200]  and five years before any of these illegals even get an immigration hearing.
[12:18.200 --> 12:27.080]  In fact, that is in the news today.
[12:27.080 --> 12:40.800]  Judge sets hearings for illegal alien minors four years from now, the average is four years
[12:40.800 --> 12:45.360]  and welfare is automatically extended, tax refunds are automatically extended, you can
[12:45.360 --> 12:48.520]  get three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[12:48.520 --> 12:58.040]  Some households get over $80 million a year in tax refunds in Austin, Texas.
[12:58.040 --> 13:00.040]  That's come out in the news and no one gets in trouble.
[13:00.040 --> 13:04.240]  There's over a hundred million at one house in Atlanta.
[13:04.240 --> 13:07.920]  Now the Democratic Party fences this money through.
[13:07.920 --> 13:11.080]  The people at these houses are just cutouts, they're not getting the money.
[13:11.080 --> 13:19.040]  I mean, do you think Akron on video was ready to run child sex slaves and help the Veritas
[13:19.040 --> 13:26.640]  project posing as pimps run sex slaves at Akron after Akron facility?
[13:26.640 --> 13:29.600]  Do you think that's just where they stop, ladies and gentlemen?
[13:29.600 --> 13:37.400]  This is an organized crime takeover that will implode the country.
[13:37.400 --> 13:44.800]  Miami schools flooded with 1,400 new immigrants from Central America.
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.760]  Father of man killed by illegal immigrant demands president visit son's grave.
[13:49.760 --> 13:50.760]  That's another thing.
[13:50.760 --> 13:57.640]  The world is emptying out its prisons and giving them plane tickets and ship passage
[13:57.640 --> 14:02.280]  or bus passage to the United States.
[14:02.280 --> 14:06.520]  As Latin America collapses, as other areas of the world go into global meltdown, the
[14:06.520 --> 14:09.400]  Caribbean is in meltdown.
[14:09.400 --> 14:10.400]  Look up the numbers.
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.400]  Double the crime from what the Caribbean had just five years ago.
[14:14.400 --> 14:18.720]  Even places that had low crime like Grand Cayman are seeing an increase.
[14:18.720 --> 14:27.160]  The Bahamas is overrun one of the most dangerous places in the world now.
[14:27.160 --> 14:30.040]  Society is breaking down all over the planet.
[14:30.040 --> 14:35.280]  Every military think tank metric shows that.
[14:35.280 --> 14:37.720]  Military defense Hagle admits that.
[14:37.720 --> 14:47.120]  And what is Obama doing and his controllers but accelerating this problem reaction solution?
[14:47.120 --> 14:52.400]  Now I covered immigration first because that's coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[14:52.400 --> 14:56.400]  And that is clearly the end of our country that's happening right now.
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.120]  The bait is set to now bring unlimited numbers in as the word gets out that you get there,
[15:01.120 --> 15:03.880]  you get free welfare, everything it's taken care of.
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.560]  You become a new political war to the state as long as you vote for whatever the globalist
[15:08.560 --> 15:10.040]  want.
[15:10.040 --> 15:17.000]  This is the takedown plan.
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.760]  Geopolitically internationally today, the top story is this.
[15:24.760 --> 15:26.960]  Reuters.
[15:26.960 --> 15:39.000]  U.S. allies to stage exercises in West Ukraine as battles rage in the East.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.040]  This is exactly what all the experts have said would start to happen is what I've said.
[15:45.040 --> 15:49.560]  Six months ago, the Ukrainians vote.
[15:49.560 --> 15:54.760]  To not join the EU and be sucked by that tyranny.
[15:54.760 --> 16:00.760]  Soros activates neo-Nazi paramilitary groups and overthrow the government, the elected
[16:00.760 --> 16:02.520]  government, which certainly wasn't perfect.
[16:02.520 --> 16:04.400]  I'm not saying that, but it was elected.
[16:04.400 --> 16:06.800]  No one disputed it was freely elected.
[16:06.800 --> 16:11.400]  They overthrow it, run all the way into the Russian pipelines, refineries and oil fields
[16:11.400 --> 16:14.880]  that have been owned least and run by Russia for 100 years.
[16:14.880 --> 16:21.080]  Russia's been there for 500 basically.
[16:21.080 --> 16:26.080]  When they try to take the Russian port or only Black Sea port and other strategic areas,
[16:26.080 --> 16:30.680]  Russia sends in forces to protect them for their interests.
[16:30.680 --> 16:37.320]  The issue is the West initiated this, just like they initiated ISIS, which is really
[16:37.320 --> 16:43.680]  al-Qaeda in Iraq, that went into Syria.
[16:43.680 --> 16:46.840]  Just like our government backs the Muslim Brotherhood, just like they backed the jihadis
[16:46.840 --> 16:55.120]  taking down Qaddafi, al-Qaeda's been attacking Jordan and Soros came out and admitted responsibility
[16:55.120 --> 17:03.800]  in the New York Times for the coup and mass murder in Ukraine.
[17:03.800 --> 17:08.240]  And so as things escalate, notice you heard yesterday, oh, NATO's going to send a rapid
[17:08.240 --> 17:14.280]  reaction force the next few months in case Russia invades, NATO is already in Ukraine,
[17:14.280 --> 17:16.680]  already in Poland, already has advisors.
[17:16.680 --> 17:20.240]  Russia's come out, there's already mercenaries.
[17:20.240 --> 17:23.640]  A lot of people that don't want war with Russia are trying to de-escalate it saying, oh, Russia
[17:23.640 --> 17:27.600]  doesn't really have troops in each of Ukraine, yes they do.
[17:27.600 --> 17:33.440]  And there's battles going on, a proxy war directly with Russia right now.
[17:33.440 --> 17:38.400]  It's not like we're having a proxy war with Russia through Vietnam or a proxy war with
[17:38.400 --> 17:47.320]  Russia in Angola or Rhodesia.
[17:47.320 --> 17:54.160]  The United States of America and NATO is now in a proxy war directly with mercenaries
[17:54.160 --> 17:59.520]  and CIA advisors with Russian troops.
[17:59.520 --> 18:03.800]  There's a steady stream of body bags going back to Russia, Russian troops and funerals
[18:03.800 --> 18:05.160]  all over the country.
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.520]  I've gone and checked, and yes, ladies and gentlemen, there are dead mercs and others
[18:09.520 --> 18:10.520]  coming back here.
[18:10.520 --> 18:13.200]  Shall I explain this again?
[18:13.200 --> 18:20.000]  From all the intel we have, the United States, run by George Soros and others, a known Nazi
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.840]  collaborator, this is like a Twilight Zone episode, has gone in, overthrown Ukraine,
[18:24.840 --> 18:32.440]  run over Russian interests, the Russians have inserted troops, the CIA director was over
[18:32.440 --> 18:38.240]  there running it, Senator Mendes has been over there running it, it's on.
[18:38.240 --> 18:44.480]  And if they start running airstrikes, NATO does, as they said they will, against Russians,
[18:44.480 --> 18:49.400]  then Russia will start responding, shooting down those aircraft and then it escalates
[18:49.400 --> 18:57.880]  to the point of where General Jackson was during the Kosovo war when the Russians controlled
[18:57.880 --> 19:01.800]  that airfield that they've controlled since the end of World War II and Pristina and they
[19:01.800 --> 19:11.160]  ordered NATO to attack the Russians on the airfield and the head of NATO overruled the
[19:11.160 --> 19:19.720]  U.S. NATO commanders, the British head and said, I will not start World War III.
[19:19.720 --> 19:25.360]  We literally, people just think we can't have a war with Russia, people just think we're
[19:25.360 --> 19:26.600]  not going to have a nuclear war.
[19:26.600 --> 19:30.000]  People just expect everything's going to go on forever like it's always.
[19:30.000 --> 19:36.240]  This is what's going to end up destroying our society, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:36.240 --> 19:38.880]  This is what's going to end up really causing a problem.
[19:38.880 --> 19:43.120]  U.S. allies to stage exercises in West Ukraine is battle rages in the East, Reuters will
[19:43.120 --> 19:44.720]  come back and tell you about that.
[19:44.720 --> 19:50.960]  Russia's strategic nuclear forces to hold major exercise this month, Reuters.
[19:50.960 --> 19:54.880]  NATO weighs rapid reaction response from Eastern Europe, it's already going on.
[19:54.880 --> 20:01.200]  Putin orders building hastened at new Russian spaceport, it's all coming up.

[20:35.480 --> 20:39.480]  it's happening now right here in the United States and your rights are at risk.
[20:39.480 --> 20:43.840]  If passed, HR-5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.

[21:00.320 --> 21:05.480]  Global warming purports rising CO2 levels while evolution describes mutated DNA.
[21:05.480 --> 21:09.840]  The fraudulent sciences describe effects of iron poisoning and copper depletion.
[21:09.840 --> 21:12.600]  As generations are iron poisoned and copper deprived.
[21:12.600 --> 21:16.880]  The DNA has mutated and weakened, as blood types AB and O.
[21:16.880 --> 21:20.920]  These blood types and rhesus factor are falsely used as evidence of evolution.
[21:20.920 --> 21:24.120]  Humans were created solely with blood type AB negative.
[21:24.120 --> 21:28.440]  Fraudulent science reports mutated DNA, coupled with rising CO2 levels and blood,
[21:28.440 --> 21:30.800]  are causing humans to go into extinction.
[21:30.800 --> 21:36.120]  In truth, humans are being methodically exterminated by iron poisoning and copper depletion.
[21:36.120 --> 21:40.600]  Blood type AB is on the shroud of Turin and matches the healthy population.
[21:40.600 --> 21:44.960]  They claim this is evidence, they are from the line of Christ and thus are His Christ.
[21:44.960 --> 21:49.960]  They are from the lines that were disinherited 2,000 years ago and now they claim to be His Christ.

[22:03.400 --> 22:08.920]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on and a home to call your own.
[22:08.920 --> 22:11.960]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[22:11.960 --> 22:14.120]  I'm telling you to take cover.
[22:14.120 --> 22:18.440]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[22:18.440 --> 22:20.480]  Do you even have a plan B?
[22:20.480 --> 22:23.800]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[22:23.800 --> 22:25.080]  Children left with no homes.
[22:25.080 --> 22:26.920]  And no one's coming to help them.

[22:55.240 --> 22:58.920]  Remember before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[22:58.920 --> 23:02.600]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself,
[23:02.600 --> 23:06.040]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[23:06.040 --> 23:08.360]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[23:08.360 --> 23:13.640]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[23:13.640 --> 23:18.840]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[23:18.840 --> 23:22.200]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[23:22.200 --> 23:26.200]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[23:26.200 --> 23:30.520]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[23:30.520 --> 23:35.960]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[23:35.960 --> 23:40.760]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[23:40.760 --> 23:45.160]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.

[24:13.480 --> 24:22.360]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
[24:22.360 --> 24:38.360]  good. I focus on the pain. The only thing that's real. The needle pairs the hole.
[24:39.640 --> 24:44.680]  Well General McHenry has come out and said we helped build ISIS.
[24:46.360 --> 24:49.960]  Weapons from Benghazi ended up in the hands of Islamic State radicals.
[24:49.960 --> 24:56.760]  We told you several years ago that was coming. Oh gee, Al Qaeda now named ISIS,
[24:56.760 --> 25:00.920]  now named IS to confuse the public. Why they're going to attack America now.
[25:00.920 --> 25:04.520]  Why the attack is imminent in Texas or on the Texas border.
[25:05.240 --> 25:10.200]  The Department of Homeland Security says by or on September 11th,
[25:10.200 --> 25:12.840]  we've got our reporters down there on the ground.
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.560]  Why is that border wide open? That clip is coming up.
[25:17.560 --> 25:21.640]  But back to the top story geopolitically.
[25:22.360 --> 25:28.200]  U.S. allies to stage exercise in West Ukraine as battles rage in the east
[25:28.920 --> 25:34.040]  as fighting between the army and Russian-backed rebels rage in eastern Ukraine.
[25:34.040 --> 25:39.400]  Preparations are underway near the western border for a joint military exercise this month
[25:39.400 --> 25:42.840]  with more than 1,000 troops from the United States and its allies.
[25:42.840 --> 25:49.000]  The decision to go ahead with the rapid trident exercise, September 16th to 26th,
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.600]  is seen as a sign of the commitment NATO states to support non-NATO member Ukraine
[25:54.600 --> 25:58.840]  while stopping well short of military intervention in the conflict.
[25:58.840 --> 26:03.800]  The annual exercise that take place training center near Ukraine's border with Poland
[26:03.800 --> 26:09.400]  was initially scheduled for July but was put back because early planning was disrupted by the crisis
[26:09.400 --> 26:17.000]  in the eastern part of the country. Continuing here with what's unfolding in Russia,
[26:17.560 --> 26:26.120]  Russia is now to conduct drills with their nuclear forces, Russia's strategic nuclear forces
[26:26.120 --> 26:31.320]  to hold major exercise this month. The forces responsible for Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal
[26:31.320 --> 26:34.920]  will conduct major exercises this month involving more than 4,000 soldiers.
[26:34.920 --> 26:41.800]  The Defense Ministry said today in a latest sign of rising tension with NATO over the Ukraine crisis.
[26:41.800 --> 26:45.400]  In an announcement a day before the start of the NATO summit in Wales,
[26:45.400 --> 26:50.920]  RIA News Agency quoted the ministry as saying the exercise would take place
[26:50.920 --> 26:57.480]  in Altia in south-central Russia and would also include around 400 technical units
[26:57.480 --> 26:59.720]  and extensive use of air power.
[26:59.720 --> 27:08.520]  The head of their strategic rocket forces is saying troops would practice countering irregular units
[27:08.520 --> 27:14.520]  in high precision weapons and conducting combat missions in conditions of active
[27:15.160 --> 27:20.040]  radio, electronic jamming and intensive enemy actions in areas of troop deployment
[27:21.720 --> 27:25.560]  or close-quarter medium range and short-range strategic nuke war.
[27:25.560 --> 27:31.960]  That's basically what they're preparing for. He said enemy forces would be represented in the
[27:31.960 --> 27:41.400]  exercise by Russian special forces units. Supersonic MiG-31 fighter interceptors and
[27:41.400 --> 27:47.560]  SU-24MR reconnaissance aircraft would take part, saying the scale of the power involved
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.360]  was unprecedented for exercises of this type. Both Russia and NATO have stepped up military
[27:52.360 --> 27:56.520]  maneuvers since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian
[27:56.520 --> 28:02.280]  separatists in the east of the former Soviet Republic. A Kremlin Secretary-Advisor said Tuesday
[28:02.280 --> 28:07.240]  that Russia would update its military doctrine this year in light of the Ukraine crisis and
[28:07.240 --> 28:17.800]  sharp deterioration of relations with NATO. A new cold war, and I'm going to say it again,
[28:17.800 --> 28:23.800]  I don't lionize, I don't romanticize, I don't deify any of the Russians.
[28:25.960 --> 28:31.400]  But the Russians are not teaching our kids 2 plus 2 equals 5 and saying if we have businesses we
[28:31.400 --> 28:35.880]  didn't build them or that raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt. They're not funding al-Qaeda
[28:35.880 --> 28:42.920]  all over the world, they're fighting them. They're promoting Christian values now in Russia compared
[28:42.920 --> 28:49.560]  to us, family values. And that's why the west, run by a bunch of mental patients, it's not even
[28:49.560 --> 28:56.280]  America, it's the criminal nutballs that have control of our society, the military industrial
[28:56.280 --> 29:02.040]  complex and the big banks that wanted to suck Ukraine and a bunch of other former Soviet satellites
[29:02.040 --> 29:07.800]  dry. So they're replacing the old Soviet tyranny 20-something years ago with a new globalist tyranny.
[29:07.800 --> 29:12.760]  The EU operates, ladies and gentlemen, just like the old Soviet Union does. We've had members of the
[29:12.760 --> 29:21.720]  EU parliament on like Nigel Farage many times, the head of UKIP. The head of the outgoing president
[29:21.720 --> 29:27.960]  of the Czech Republic said it's the new Soviet Union. So it's that America is becoming super
[29:27.960 --> 29:35.720]  corrupt, the EU is ultra-corrupt, and it's starting a fight with Russia and just pushing
[29:35.720 --> 29:40.120]  it's very dangerous. We're going to open the phones up when we come back, give the number,
[29:40.120 --> 29:44.280]  I'll get your take on this and more. I had confirmed this before with Venezuelan listeners
[29:44.280 --> 29:50.440]  and friends, but Reuters reports that they now pray in public school to Chavez. We're on the march,
[29:50.440 --> 29:56.040]  the empire's on the run. State is not God. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.080 --> 30:05.080]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much,
[30:05.080 --> 30:11.320]  get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the
[30:11.320 --> 30:17.560]  world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered
[30:17.560 --> 30:23.800]  a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine
[30:23.800 --> 30:28.040]  that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is
[30:28.040 --> 30:34.440]  powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals and the results that I personally
[30:34.440 --> 30:41.560]  have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals,
[30:41.560 --> 30:46.680]  ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com,
[30:46.680 --> 30:51.080]  the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[33:50.360 --> 33:54.520]  I want to get into General Mackin Ernie, I always pronounce that wrong,
[33:55.320 --> 33:59.240]  saying, quote, we helped build ISIS on national television on Fox News.
[33:59.240 --> 34:13.960]  We're also going to get into the fact that it is emerging the preponderance of evidence
[34:13.960 --> 34:19.880]  that the beheading videos are indeed fake. That doesn't mean ISIS isn't really chopping
[34:19.880 --> 34:24.680]  people's heads off by the tens of thousands every few months, haven't killed over 300,000 people in
[34:24.680 --> 34:29.320]  Syria alone, more than 50,000 conservative estimates by lands and others in Iraq.
[34:31.800 --> 34:36.600]  Remember who's funding them and protecting them, but now these reporters, it's turning out work
[34:36.600 --> 34:45.640]  for groups that are known CIA cutouts and are being released by the same group that got caught
[34:45.640 --> 34:53.880]  putting out a fake Al Qaeda video before. And they think the public is so stupid, they upload the
[34:53.880 --> 34:59.560]  Al Qaeda logos with the Defense Department logos in the same video layer. Let me explain that.
[34:59.560 --> 35:07.400]  It's produced at the same time on the same computer. They don't even care to create one copy,
[35:07.400 --> 35:12.360]  run it through, grab it like it's been compressed already, and then put another layer over it,
[35:12.360 --> 35:18.920]  so you can see the layers of compression. They just don't care. Like Obama's birth certificate
[35:18.920 --> 35:25.720]  was in eight different layers, completely fake, put out in the layers, not combined with the fake
[35:25.720 --> 35:32.520]  typewriter computer print. Each typewriter strike is different, like a snowflake or fingerprint.
[35:32.520 --> 35:37.320]  These were identical. Within hours, we said it was fake. Within months, top experts all came out
[35:37.320 --> 35:41.960]  and said the same thing because you could look at it in minutes and see it was fake. The typewriter
[35:41.960 --> 35:52.360]  strikes, the C's, the T's, the A's, everything was a basically Microsoft Word fake typewriter font.
[35:54.600 --> 36:01.240]  Mint to be fake, mint to just flaunt it in our face and see make it all a debate that he's really
[36:01.240 --> 36:07.480]  from Kenya because he wasn't, that wasn't his dad. He was from Hawaii, the son of a famous communist
[36:07.480 --> 36:12.440]  who it turned out he would spend summers with and who was his father, all hiding in plain view,
[36:12.440 --> 36:19.960]  Frank Marshall Davis. Unbelievable. See how they run those psyops? That's why he announced in his
[36:19.960 --> 36:24.520]  Harvard Law Review Journal that he was the editor of, that he was born in Kenya. That's why his wife
[36:24.520 --> 36:29.560]  in 2007 gave three speeches saying we went back to his homeland where he was born in Kenya.
[36:29.560 --> 36:37.640]  He was all setting it up for us to take the bait. See how sophisticated psyops are?
[36:41.880 --> 36:47.080]  Shotloff video found by Group responsible for releasing fake Osama bin Laden video.
[36:47.080 --> 36:49.400]  Group connected to Homeland Security and government insiders.
[36:50.840 --> 36:56.600]  Well, yeah, it's a Defense Department subdivision. James Foley worked under U.S. aid, a known
[36:56.600 --> 37:01.720]  U.S. intelligence front. He was more than just a journalist. Yeah, like
[37:05.240 --> 37:10.520]  Michael Hastings, whose wife was in the National Security Council who said,
[37:10.520 --> 37:14.840]  Homeland Security's after me. Oh my God, the government's pure evil. I'm going to warn everybody.
[37:14.840 --> 37:20.520]  Don't let him kill me. And then his car blew up. And we've talked to his family calling up crying,
[37:20.520 --> 37:27.400]  begging us, you know, no, they'll get us. I mean, they killed him. They blew him up.
[37:29.160 --> 37:32.520]  And then right after that, his wife got so scared she went on Pierce Morgan and said
[37:32.520 --> 37:34.680]  he died. It was completely normal and everything's fine.
[37:37.160 --> 37:42.600]  But see Hastings had a soul. And when he learned about what the government was really up to and
[37:42.600 --> 37:47.400]  really doing, he didn't want to be part of it anymore. And well, he knew too much like Pat Tillman,
[37:47.400 --> 37:58.040]  didn't he? And all the other army buddies and people basically got threatened and got scared.
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.040]  Joe Biggs didn't. That's why he works here now. That's the kind of reporters we want.
[38:03.480 --> 38:10.760]  James Foley worked under USAID, a known U.S. intelligence front. Was he more than just a
[38:10.760 --> 38:18.840]  journalist? I don't know, do bears live in the woods? And Joe Biggs was groped as ISIS storms
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.960]  open U.S. border. Info wars reporter Joe Biggs is groped by the TSA while heading to El Paso.
[38:23.960 --> 38:30.440]  And while the legals are allowed to fly without ID, that's official Homeland Security memo
[38:31.800 --> 38:33.720]  picked up by info wars.com and Breitbart.
[38:33.720 --> 38:43.000]  That's just some of what's going on. Some of what's happening.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.800]  Credible job, Josh Owens and Joe Biggs and the rest of our recruit.
[38:51.080 --> 38:57.720]  I want to get to the video clip in a moment of General McEarney. We helped build ISIS in just a
[38:57.720 --> 39:07.640]  moment. Before we go any further, we do have a very limited supply of the occupier that isn't
[39:07.640 --> 39:14.920]  just for the eyes. It's known, patented and certified compounds that are on record as rejuvenating
[39:14.920 --> 39:20.760]  and cleaning the cells and more. It's a super charged formula, super strong, super powerful,
[39:20.760 --> 39:28.040]  and super affordable. Again, competing brands of things similar upwards of $60 to $70 is $29.95.
[39:28.040 --> 39:34.040]  Occupower, we bring you the very best organic, purified and patented high quality fusions,
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.040]  very competitive and your purchase supports the transmission. It's almost sold out. It'll be a
[39:40.040 --> 39:47.000]  few months till we get more. It is still a few weeks, probably three, four weeks. We're hoping
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.960]  until we get more DNA force in. We do have the super male vitality, the super female vitality,
[39:52.680 --> 39:59.560]  known concentrated herbs and fruit and plant extracts that don't mimic testosterone and
[39:59.560 --> 40:05.400]  progesterone and things. They help the body clean out its glands and trigger them to release
[40:05.400 --> 40:11.480]  the natural stuff. That's key. All I know is that's what Dr. Gribbs research and other show.
[40:11.480 --> 40:18.920]  All I know is it works for me. Anybody that's seen me in person knows that you can see it on
[40:18.920 --> 40:24.120]  television as well, but I still stay up late and work really hard. I've lost a ton of weight. I'm
[40:24.120 --> 40:29.080]  just losing more and more. I keep having to buy pants sizes going down. My pants are falling
[40:29.080 --> 40:34.280]  off of me right now. I've gone to that phase where there's just no fat on my chest, arms and
[40:34.280 --> 40:41.800]  shoulders. It's just now drooping down. I got to like 275 pounds and I'm down like 220 pounds.
[40:41.800 --> 40:48.280]  It's just amazing, but I should be about 180. I've got that point is where there's this belly,
[40:48.280 --> 40:54.920]  but it's just hanging now. It starts getting soft and just evaporating. I've been working out less
[40:54.920 --> 41:02.520]  than I used to. I used to go on like six, seven mile high a couple days a week, swim two miles
[41:02.520 --> 41:09.080]  and just changing my diet a little bit and taking some supplements, some of the M4s health.com
[41:09.080 --> 41:13.960]  products. I lost about 25, 30 pounds and then I kind of gained some of it back and not working
[41:13.960 --> 41:20.280]  out. It's amazing what getting true nation iodine, survival shield X2 in my body is done.
[41:21.320 --> 41:25.640]  When you purchase the products, it funds the whole operation, but these really are groundbreaking.
[41:25.640 --> 41:29.880]  Take the challenge. You've heard the rave reviews. Get a bottle of Super Female for your wife.
[41:29.880 --> 41:36.520]  Get a bottle of Super Male for your husband or vice versa. Try it out. I'll warn you, this is all
[41:36.520 --> 41:42.920]  certified good, what they call FDA grass, meaning it's things that are known to be safe,
[41:42.920 --> 41:47.240]  but it's so purified and concentrated. It took me a while to build up even the regular dose of
[41:47.240 --> 41:52.440]  Super Male Vitality. It took me a while to be able to build the regular dose of just the regular
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.480]  survival shield, not even the X2. So this is not a game. When you take the fluoride shield,
[41:57.480 --> 42:01.480]  it's a key later, targeting all sorts of heavy metals and things. Fluoride's the main thing
[42:01.480 --> 42:10.680]  at targets. You will detox. These are not joke products. We want to have things that are so good.
[42:10.680 --> 42:20.440]  People come back over and over again. It's a win-win. Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[42:20.440 --> 42:27.160]  Also, purified water is essential. We have the ProPure G2 entire family,
[42:27.160 --> 42:32.040]  the clearly filtered and other brands of high quality filters that have the highest ratings
[42:32.040 --> 42:35.720]  for cutting out and reducing or completely removing, depending on the toxin,
[42:36.520 --> 42:41.240]  at the most affordable prices. They're also very simple to use and portable.
[42:41.240 --> 42:51.240]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139. And again, thank you for your support.
[42:51.240 --> 42:54.600]  Thank you for spreading the word about the broadcast, showing that we can promote the
[42:54.600 --> 42:59.480]  truth and justice and reality and free market systems. All right.
[42:59.480 --> 43:12.600]  All right. Headline. Infowars.com. General McEarney. We helped build ISIS.
[43:13.480 --> 43:19.640]  Weapons from Benghazi ended up in the hands of Islamic State radicals. Paul Joseph Watson.
[43:19.640 --> 43:29.720]  During an appearance on Fox News, General Thomas McEarney acknowledged that the United States
[43:29.720 --> 43:34.200]  helped build ISIS, close quote, as a result of the group obtaining weapons from Benghazi,
[43:34.840 --> 43:41.240]  consulate in Libya, which was attacked by jihadists in September 2012. I had Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer,
[43:41.240 --> 43:48.120]  who ran black operations against Al Qaeda, on a few days after it happened. And he said it was
[43:48.120 --> 43:52.440]  basically an assassination of the ambassador because he wouldn't go along with the transfer
[43:52.440 --> 43:58.520]  of weapons to Al Qaeda. The Turkish ambassador was there and got mad. We don't know if Obama
[43:58.520 --> 44:02.920]  ordered to hit or whether it was Turkey, but it was a set up and they were ordered to stand down.
[44:02.920 --> 44:07.080]  Now he tried to walk it back a few days later because he still advises the Pentagon and Army
[44:07.080 --> 44:13.800]  War College. They completely flipped out on it. But then I had other sources in the CIA, some known,
[44:13.800 --> 44:21.240]  some unknown. Tosh Plumlee and others, you've heard them on air. I mean, Google Tosh Plumlee,
[44:21.240 --> 44:27.560]  folks. He's like ultra famous. To the point of from Iran Contra hearings, church hearings,
[44:28.680 --> 44:33.240]  that he still flies CIA aircraft and secret operations. He's been doing it since the late
[44:33.240 --> 44:38.200]  50s. That's the kind of characters that are out there from Texas. He's from Texas. I mean,
[44:38.200 --> 44:42.520]  he's done interviews while he's in a C-130 loaded with weapons about the fly of the Middle East.
[44:42.520 --> 44:46.280]  And you go, well, why is he even allowed to operate? And he's been a whistleblower twice
[44:46.280 --> 44:50.840]  because there's the light side of the whole operation that is mad about what's going on.
[44:51.400 --> 44:57.160]  And he legitimately has his job and he's only gone public when it's treason.
[44:58.040 --> 45:00.680]  I mean, is it treason to give Stinger missiles to Al Qaeda?
[45:03.720 --> 45:06.840]  He was told that by a high level NATO official and an army official.
[45:06.840 --> 45:15.240]  And I've basically been told that they're going to blow my head off if I keep interviewing people
[45:15.240 --> 45:18.680]  like Tosh Plumlee. Well, look, I mean, I get on the highway every day. I could die in a car wreck.
[45:19.480 --> 45:25.000]  I could have a stroke today. I mean, I'm not afraid to die. I don't look forward to it.
[45:25.560 --> 45:31.880]  I don't want to die, but I don't want to live as a slave in a country where our government is run
[45:31.880 --> 45:35.320]  by criminals that arm Al Qaeda so they can run around chopping people's heads off.
[45:35.320 --> 45:40.360]  And then you can use the Al Qaeda threat to take our freedoms. What I'm getting at here
[45:43.800 --> 45:49.720]  is that it's a fact that if there is an Al Qaeda attack in the next week, week and a half,
[45:50.280 --> 45:54.040]  or there is one in Europe or one six months or a year from now, they're saying it's imminent right
[45:54.040 --> 45:59.160]  now. I don't know if that's true or not. I know these jihadis are a real group. I know they're
[45:59.160 --> 46:04.360]  out of their minds. I know there's hundreds of thousands of them. And I know that it was in
[46:04.360 --> 46:09.160]  the London Telegraph yesterday and other publications that they let them fly around Europe. They let
[46:09.160 --> 46:13.080]  them operate on Twitter and Facebook because they're a secret army of the globalist.
[46:14.520 --> 46:19.240]  So here's the deal. You're going to let Al Qaeda fly around and stuff. You're going to let me fly
[46:19.240 --> 46:23.240]  without putting me in a naked body scanner and grabbing my genitals. I've had enough of this.
[46:24.120 --> 46:32.280]  It's a fraud. It's a joke. And I'm not putting up with it anymore. I want my Bill of Rights
[46:32.280 --> 46:39.160]  the Constitution back right now. And the American people should be so upset about this. DHS says
[46:39.160 --> 46:43.960]  the number one enemy is who. Your new list or just search engine when I'm saying, you'll have
[46:43.960 --> 46:50.680]  mainstream news, Washington Post, Homeland Security stands by terror designation. Homeland
[46:50.680 --> 46:58.120]  Security stands behind Patriots is number one threat. Founding fathers would not be welcome in
[46:58.120 --> 47:04.920]  today's army. Fox News after we broke it. DoD training manual extremist founding fathers
[47:04.920 --> 47:08.440]  would not be welcome in today's army. You can read the official Department of Defense training
[47:08.440 --> 47:15.080]  manual. It's not even secret. Obviously, these are the bad guys trying to teach our military.
[47:15.080 --> 47:20.120]  The founders wouldn't be welcome in our military. Well, that shows what our military is being turned
[47:20.120 --> 47:29.560]  into. Our government promotes open socialism and communism now. The borders are wide open.
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.920]  Fort Hood soldiers were told that Christians, Tea Partiers, a radical terror threat that could
[47:36.920 --> 47:42.680]  be court-martialed for it. After we broke the document, Fox News picked it up. We did a part
[47:42.680 --> 47:49.080]  two article that click on that blue link for TV viewers. Fox News. And Fox News had a headline
[47:49.080 --> 47:55.240]  like, well, maybe does army consider Christians Tea Party a terror threat? Then you read it and it
[47:55.240 --> 48:01.960]  says that it says you'll be court-martialed. Since when can you not be an evangelical Christian
[48:01.960 --> 48:08.360]  or give money to the Tea Party? But see, they're on MSNBC promoting saying Democrats,
[48:08.360 --> 48:12.440]  if you want free handouts and goodies, you better give money to the Democratic Party.
[48:12.440 --> 48:16.200]  Blue collar people, you better give money to the Democratic Party. They fundraise
[48:16.200 --> 48:23.000]  for the Democrats on MSNBC. But then you want to be a pro-life group just promoting don't kill
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.480]  babies? We're going to come shut you down, take your tax exemption. Oh, you're an event,
[48:27.480 --> 48:31.240]  you're a Christian group, you're a patriot group. We're going to audit every Tea Party group out
[48:31.240 --> 48:35.880]  there. Well, that's meant to intimidate you, but it's also meant so you can't organize. I mean,
[48:35.880 --> 48:42.760]  this is a takeover. And I've cut my teeth attacking Republican neocons and warmongers and the rest
[48:42.760 --> 48:47.000]  of them. The point is is that you've got the globalist. It's bad enough to only have two big
[48:47.000 --> 48:53.320]  parties. They're whacking the Republican Party right now. And John Boehner's double dealing,
[48:54.200 --> 48:59.560]  making deals, playing golf with Obama, selling us out. It's all a big, sick joke.
[49:01.240 --> 49:05.720]  It's not enough to get rid of Eric Canner. We've got to get rid of every one of these
[49:05.720 --> 49:12.440]  fake Republicans and we could save this country. That's why the entire power structure for the
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.480]  2014 elections, Republican Democratic leadership has everything they've got. All their big political
[49:17.480 --> 49:25.400]  guns pointed directly at the real Tea Party that promotes second amendment, national sovereignty,
[49:26.280 --> 49:31.480]  basic things because the globalist want to get rid of all the old existing bill of rights
[49:31.480 --> 49:37.880]  constitution checks and balances so they can fully take control of our society. Let's go to this
[49:37.880 --> 49:46.280]  general McInerney clip admitting that our government helped give missiles to Al Qaeda. Here it is.
[49:46.280 --> 49:52.760]  Two different things in the Ukraine and in Syria. Syria, we backed, I believe in some cases,
[49:52.760 --> 49:58.040]  some of the wrong people and not in the right part of the Free Syrian Army. And that's a little
[49:58.040 --> 50:03.720]  confusing to people. So I've always maintained and go back quite some time that we were backing
[50:03.720 --> 50:09.000]  the wrong types. I think it's going to turn out maybe this weekend in a new special that Brett
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.200]  Bear is going to have Friday that's going to show some of those weapons from Benghazi ended up in
[50:14.200 --> 50:20.840]  the hands of ISIS. So we helped build ISIS. Now there's a danger there and I'm with you. But in
[50:20.840 --> 50:29.800]  the Ukraine, we need to show support in Iraq against Syria and in Iraq. We need to show support
[50:29.800 --> 50:36.040]  that we're going to go and take down, I believe, take down ISIS and we can do that without boosting
[50:36.040 --> 50:43.400]  Bashir al-Assad. Okay, I've never heard such deceptive spin right there. We need to show support
[50:43.400 --> 50:51.560]  against Syria, ISIS. See, they create ISIS armament, protect them, try to bring down Assad with
[50:51.560 --> 50:58.120]  a manel. Oh, we need to attack Syria to get ISIS. They're going to attack Assad. I mean, this is
[50:58.120 --> 51:03.480]  just, it's just incredible what they get away with. Clean water at home, clean water at the office,
[51:03.480 --> 51:09.240]  clean water on the go. The Berkey guy has a Berkey water filtration model for anywhere you are and

[51:33.480 --> 51:39.320]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying. Manipulated financial markets
[51:39.320 --> 51:45.480]  and economic figures, chaos on our border, China and Russia bypassing the dollar, life is getting
[51:45.480 --> 51:52.280]  ready to change. You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy. Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com

[52:03.080 --> 52:08.600]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply. Several
[52:08.600 --> 52:12.600]  years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this
[52:12.600 --> 52:17.240]  country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take
[52:17.240 --> 52:23.400]  action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born. MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan
[52:23.400 --> 52:29.080]  or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50

[54:44.600 --> 54:49.160]  Valhalla Jones. What do you guys think of that as his name for a girl?
[54:49.160 --> 54:57.720]  It means Val. I think your name is Valerie. Muckley likes the name Valhalla, you do?
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.720]  He likes it. I love it. Valhalla Guder Damarong Jones.
[55:06.840 --> 55:08.760]  Let's get serious here, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:10.440 --> 55:18.360]  Venezuelan Socialist Party swaps God for Chavez Prayer. And I knew that in some of the old Soviet
[55:18.360 --> 55:25.000]  republics, they would have children. I know Cuba did this, and I talked to refugees from Venezuela
[55:25.720 --> 55:28.920]  and a computer programmer that we had just a freelance workforce as well,
[55:29.880 --> 55:35.160]  whose parents ran a school in Venezuela. And when the government nationalized it,
[55:35.160 --> 55:38.600]  they basically just made them work for basically free or they would just take it away from them,
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.320]  that you would set milk in front of the little kids in cereal in the morning.
[55:43.320 --> 55:47.960]  Well, first you'd have the kids all sit down in first period and start a school
[55:49.240 --> 55:53.800]  and say, all right, pray to Jesus for milk and cereal. Oh,
[55:57.080 --> 56:02.680]  Jesus, please give me milk and cereal. Open your eyes. There's no milk and cereal.
[56:02.680 --> 56:08.760]  This is when Chavez was alive. Then they would pray to Chavez to give them milk and cereal,
[56:08.760 --> 56:11.480]  and there would be milk and cereal. They would then pray for their lunch.
[56:11.480 --> 56:16.920]  There would be lunch. And so the children learned that the state was God.
[56:19.240 --> 56:27.000]  Well, this is in Reuters now. Venezuelan Socialist Party swaps God for Chavez in new prayer.
[56:30.280 --> 56:34.120]  You'd better to pray to the Son if you want to be a pagan. So pray to Chavez. At least the
[56:34.120 --> 56:40.600]  Son actually gives you life. People don't even think about the Son. A member of Venezuela's
[56:40.600 --> 56:46.120]  Socialist Party has rolled out a variation of the classic Christian Lord's Prayer to implore
[56:46.120 --> 56:51.240]  beloved late leader Hugo Chavez for protection from the evils of capitalism.
[56:53.080 --> 56:56.520]  Well, the only evil of capitalism is you become so wealthy, your kids become spoiled brats.
[56:57.800 --> 57:05.160]  Here's the prayer. Are Chavez who art in heaven, the earth, the sea, and who delegates, red-shirted,
[57:05.160 --> 57:14.280]  delegate Maria Estrella, recited on Monday at the PSUV Party Congress, continuing with the
[57:14.280 --> 57:19.960]  blasphemous prayer. Hallowed be thy name, may your legacy come to us so we can spread it to people
[57:19.960 --> 57:25.720]  here and elsewhere. Give us your light to guide us every day, she said in front of an image of
[57:25.720 --> 57:31.960]  Chavez. I'm going to vomit. Lead us not into temptation of capitalism. Deliver us from the
[57:31.960 --> 57:39.400]  evil of oligarchy, like the crime of contraband, because ours is the homeland, the peace and life
[57:39.400 --> 57:47.480]  forever and ever. Amen. Viva Chavez, she exclaimed, to applause. Though Chavez died of cancer in 2013,
[57:47.480 --> 57:51.960]  he remains omnipresent in Venezuela. His photos plaster all over Capitol Caracas,
[57:52.520 --> 57:57.160]  state TV frequently airs excerpts of his famous lengthy speeches and supporters,
[57:57.160 --> 58:03.160]  sometimes Don Earing's, are pendants with an artistic black and white rendition of his eyes.
[58:03.160 --> 58:11.000]  Oh man. And again, it's not the well-to-do or the artisans or all the great people of Latin America
[58:11.000 --> 58:16.600]  that have jobs. They're being fed on by communists down there that are moving up here. It's all the
[58:16.600 --> 58:21.480]  just dumbed down socialists that want a free ride handout. Don't care their standard of living,
[58:21.480 --> 58:29.800]  has clearly gone down the last 17 years of Chavezian rule. It's 16 years and it's all just
[58:29.800 --> 58:34.360]  a complete fraud and joke. And the government people live in giant command bases with helicopters
[58:34.360 --> 58:38.520]  totally rich and they're running around robbing and destroying the middle class of the country's
[58:38.520 --> 58:44.120]  collapsing and they can't even keep the electricity on. Communism does it deliver. Communism does it
[58:44.120 --> 58:53.560]  deliver. Communism is run by offshore bankers. African Sultan top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists
[58:53.560 --> 59:00.600]  and others. We have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality

[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:46.680]  that the West helped build Al Qaeda ISIS. Shot law video found by group responsible for releasing
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:52.040]  fake. Some have been lauding video previously. James Foley worked under U.S. aid. A known U.S.

[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:05.880]  All borders wide open. Coming up. Top expert warns of inevitable Fukushima disaster in California

[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.720]  And judges are releasing the illegals saying come back to court in four years.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:38.200]  What do you think about praying to Hugo Chavez in Reuters? That's some of the news I've already
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:46.760]  hit. We've got Jennifer Lawrence calls for probe and to leak nude photos. Apple investigates app.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:55.800]  It's on a cloud Jennifer Lawrence. You put your naked photos up on a server that wasn't
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:01.240]  natively on your phone. It's bad enough to put it on your home computer or something
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.920]  where somebody can get in and get it. If you don't want naked photos out there,
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.600]  get a regular camera with the memory card and view it on a tablet or something not hooked to the
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:19.720]  Internet. I don't know how else to explain this to people. Let's probe it. Well, what are you going
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.640]  to think when they start taxing us by the mile in the next two years? That's now been announced
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:29.880]  in his official. This stuff's all real. Denying it doesn't make it go away. That's why I just want
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.120]  to get all the dirt out there. Let people know what's going on. Not trying to be negative. It's
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:40.760]  very positive. It's like a lancing a boil. Or if you've got an infected toothies or root canal,
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:46.440]  you know, getting the tooth fixed, we need to admit we've got a big pus filled root.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:52.360]  Get in there and clean it out or pull that tooth.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.880]  And I just physically, socially, spiritually feel the big rotting tooth and the big
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:07.640]  abscess in our cultural jaw. And I want that sucker out of there. That means everything's
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:17.480]  going to be perfect. I mean, we won't get another political toothache down the road. But we need
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:23.240]  to get that big scruffy, less filled pus filled new older tooth out of there, or the disease will
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:30.440]  rot into the entire jaw, get into the sinus, and we will get some type of bacterial meningitis
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:36.600]  of the political brain, which we already have. And then we'll be in a coma and then the kidneys
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:42.280]  will fail. And the whole society's going to go down. And the globalists have decided they're
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.560]  going to just perch on the dead body and somehow get sustenance out of that.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.600]  I'm using this analogy because I think it makes sense toll free number to join us on the water
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.240]  front, wide open phones, first time callers, long time callers, any subject you want to raise,

[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:18.520]  Remember Jamie Foxx prayed to Obama. He said, thank God, thank Obama for everything,
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:24.360]  our Lord and Savior, Barack Obama, Barack Obama. Maybe I'm an extremist. Maybe it's racist that
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:32.360]  I don't pray to Hugo Chavez. I just can't get over the prayer. Hallowed be thy name, may your legacy
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.760]  come to us so we can spread it to the people here and elsewhere. Give us your light to guide us every

[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.640]  soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:12.440]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:17.320]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air. And most Americans spend 90% of their
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.680]  time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:27.720]  the United States. Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:32.120]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.680]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.800]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:47.080]  against. Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A. The new

[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:09.640]  family so much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:16.120]  crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:22.120]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield true
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:27.080]  nascent iodine that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he said listen if you think
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:33.000]  this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth deep earth crystals and the results that
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.880]  I personally have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:45.400]  crystals ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com

[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:36.760]  was found by a group responsible for releasing the fake the soma bin laden video years ago
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:47.160]  directly working for the pentagon very interesting and now a top us general we played this last hour
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:54.520]  has come out general mccurney and said quote we helped build isis they have stinger missiles now
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:59.240]  again we've literally told you that thousands of times since it happened that's now been proven
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:05.000]  accurate and admitted they're now bracing but for what they call imminent terror attacks on the
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:12.760]  southern border specifically fort bliss in el paso we have former staff sergeant joe biggs
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:18.680]  who flew in last night to el paso special reports filed at infowars.com video reports
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:24.920]  he'll be joining us with inside intel on is this a hyped up threat or is it real coming up at the
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:31.640]  bottom of the hour but what are our borders doing wide open they shot video weeks ago and again
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:37.400]  last night of the border fences open at night and people just walking back and forth this is
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:43.800]  ridiculous because joe biggs got pulled out of line and groped and grabbed with the naked body
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:52.280]  scanners he was talking about coming back from afghanistan through germany one time into united
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:10:03.080]  states and he was in a wheelchair with shrapnel all over his body and they had stuck him back in
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.360]  his uniform and they were and they literally at homeland security for an hour questioning him
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:14.040]  saying why is there explosive residue on your uniform and he said are you kidding because he
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:19.960]  had a cast on his leg and his arm and stuff and he said you know this was all sutured up and closed
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:28.280]  up in afghanistan buddy of course there's explosive residue they were so stupid that they called in
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.920]  the police and fbi and people until they said yeah let him go that's how screwed up this country is
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:38.600]  you got a veteran with no criminal record who they could just search his name and there was like
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:47.560]  roland stoneman s choir articles about him already in his uniform and they're saying why is the
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:55.320]  residue of gunpowder explosives and he kept telling him with a morphine drip being pushed through

[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:19.000]  by the county because the district attorney was running around flailing and basically resisting
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.600]  police had to have a spit mask put on her pointing her finger at him going boom boom i'll get you
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:30.840]  and then rolling around the ground kicking her feet in a tantrum and biting on video
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.480]  and he said you can't run this state agency and so they've been died at him
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:45.080]  the next to susan is facing 10 years in prison for giving political contributions that i think

[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.440]  is from obama three to five years before there's a hearing so the judge said four years
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.920]  seventeen-year-old christin stepped through the swinging wooden door separating the crowded
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:27.240]  waiting area from the judge's bench straightening his lightly too big dress shirt as he slid behind
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:33.960]  the defendants desk as his lawyer took the seat beside him which is paid for by taxpayers
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.880]  he sipped on the court approved headphones so he could hear the spanish-speaking translator
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:47.160]  and his lawyer began to speak and then they went on to basically say okay we'll talk to you again
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:56.440]  in four years and the next person was brought forward immigration group surge will cost schools
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:06.680]  761 million just in the first year alone but baner says obama could get immigration reform
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:12.520]  next year they already did it by fiat so they're going yeah people are disappointed latinos
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:18.360]  disappointed we didn't get the amnesty you already did but again as if people that are his spanning
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.560]  should automatically want open borders just oh i want open borders to collapsing third world
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:27.240]  because i'm an american citizen because that's what you're supposed to do and if you're a woman
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:32.200]  you're supposed to vote for hillary and if you're black you're supposed to vote for obama and i guess
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:36.440]  if you're from texas you're supposed to buy a four-terish heavy i mean it just it just it's just
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.480]  just mindless oh i like obama yeah he gave me free health care really did you get free health care
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:46.440]  well actually my payroll tax went up oh really and they admit the death panels are real last weekend
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.080]  the new york times
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:00.280]  meanwhile there are multiple reactors built right on fault lines in california with the
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:05.000]  big earthquake they had a few weeks ago they're saying an 8.0 or bigger university expert seismologists
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.960]  you name it and federal experts we went and interviewed them they said no it'll go chernobyl
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:15.720]  or fukushima if there is a 8.0 or bigger on those fault lines and there is the only part
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:21.000]  of the ring of fire that's not triggered yet southern california right up into oregon
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:29.560]  why didn't they build the the uh devils canyon uh reactors two of them why not build them on top
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.600]  mount st helens that's probably more stable than where they built them
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.280]  you know mount st helens
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:43.800]  i was at a restaurant this weekend and the manager came by he didn't know who i was he's
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:49.080]  wearing a george washington crossing the Delaware tie and i said man i love your george washington
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.920]  tie and he said you know my grandson was over this weekend and he didn't know what it was
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.480]  he'd know george washington was
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:05.080]  and what does that say about that guy he probably sees his grandkids a couple times a year
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:11.400]  and his children have not taught them who george washington is because the reason
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.920]  there's no hollywood movies about george washington because it was so epic show over the top it
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.960]  wouldn't be believed because truth is stranger than fiction that's but the military knows who george
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:29.080]  washington is because the army at least talked that up until about 20 years ago and so now they're
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.400]  like george washington by the way is bad the militaries well why is he on our purple heart
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:38.360]  so now they're talking about taking george washington off the purple heart they told navy
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:44.200]  seals don't wear the gas and flag even though it's a flag used by the navy and john paul jones the
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:53.640]  founding of the navy navy seals can't wear it because our loving government said so and you
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:58.360]  can't say take back america because obama said it's racist but if joe biden wants to you can see it's
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:05.720]  about them setting reality and lecturing everyone and telling everyone what they can do and what
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:11.960]  they can't do i mean it's it's tyranny it's control freak it's not liberal let's go to your phone calls

[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:20.040]  listening to you for years i'm prison planet member and i just wanted to bring up the idea of um
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:26.920]  you know compassion and how a lot of people around the country think that standing up for um
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:33.720]  you know people is important to listen to your show but i think it goes to the point that all
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:39.480]  conscious creatures need to be protected and it adds to the hypocrisy i see in america when
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:45.560]  you talk about fighting for people who can't fight for themselves and and you talk about having a
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:57.080]  brisket for for your lunch break that down for me again well i just feel that we talk about
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:02.760]  compassion and we care about people who can't fight for themselves like unborn children and
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:07.480]  you know people people who don't know what's what's really going on against them uh with the
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:13.720]  government so i just wanted to i would like to hear comment about how you feel about the
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:19.160]  2012 declaration of consciousness that cambridge university um came out with saying that all
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:25.720]  creatures have consciousness and are aware of their surrounding and it i think it would help
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:30.920]  movement if we could incorporate those two not necessarily you know the peta extremists who want
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:36.760]  to kill the animals who who uh don't have well look look that's a very look obviously i don't like

[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.560]  several years ago matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:16.040]  this country was headed and the charlington's willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:21.880]  to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born my patriot supply has never

[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:16.600]  the last caller brought up a question that could be a whole three hour debate
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:24.600]  i know this though the main animal rights movement has a lot of well-meaning people in it
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:29.720]  but its main goal at the top is to take control of private property and to let government quote
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:37.080]  represent other life forms to then claim that it vetoes human votes and with the rise of the robots
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:42.120]  and the rest of it the the globalists don't need people anymore they don't need the large numbers
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:49.560]  of people there's also a radical plan to phase out earth's predatory species and we'll cover that
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.440]  coming up in the next hour i want to go to more of your calls and we've also got joe bigs coming up
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:01.640]  but it's about social engineers playing god i do agree though that factory farm chicken and
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:07.320]  not treating the animals humanely and not thinking about where it came from hurts us as well not
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:12.120]  just the animals because we get all the toxins and all the stress that they've gone through
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:18.040]  and they start irradiating the food they start you know feeding in antibiotics because they
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.040]  don't care about the chickens we don't care about the chickens or pigs well the globalists don't
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:29.640]  care about us either we all lower our values and really create a hellish world and the more we lower
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:36.920]  our values we don't get a better deal or higher quality we get a very ugly fly by night one night
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:46.680]  stand dishonorable culture sheth and ohio on abola yeah the head of the cdc says it's set to be 100
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:51.880]  thousand cases by december this is definitely the biggest outbreak ever and i think is a real threat
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:58.440]  what's your take on abola seth well i just thought it was kind of weird that right before the
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:05.560]  information about it started coming out i think it was on tnt or tbs they aired a series called the
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:16.440]  last ship basically about a uh deadly virus that was in uh egypt i think it was and then
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:23.080]  spread across the country or the world and then let me guess i didn't see the show is there one
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:30.760]  ship left for people alive on it you got it right well one ship of ours and then they
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:38.840]  continually fought against a single russian ship so there's two ships left in the world they're not
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:46.680]  working together nope well notice every theme is about how we fight with each other instead of
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:52.040]  working together and the only way to work together is through the un which again the globalist control
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:57.560]  that's how they control both sides of the debate there are literally scores of tv shows and movies
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:02.840]  out about how humans are all about to be killed in the end of the world they're just getting us ready
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:10.600]  for the controlled bioweapons release that the eugenicists are preparing for and notice they
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:16.920]  have a vaccine coming out as well so you can take that and be saved from the abola the whole
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:25.960]  thing's very suspicious what do you think oh absolutely that's basically i mean it's almost
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.440]  word for word about what's going on and what happened on that show
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:41.800]  well they uh had a doctor from the cvc on the boat trying to uh create a uh a vaccine
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.360]  well i don't think they're going to release a super pandemic right away that wipes everybody
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.120]  out but with all the gmo testing and cross species manipulation going on and viral research
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:28:01.720]  basically at a nano tech level it's very easy for a mistake to happen that wipes everybody out
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:06.920]  and the globalists know that that's why they're building human seed banks biological seed banks
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:13.240]  plant seed banks arcs as they call them it's why elites are building underground facilities
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:19.720]  private and public you know for themselves everywhere at a very very quick pace because
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:24.680]  they believe the world's carrying capacity has been reached and it's going to collapse so they
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:30.200]  want to go ahead and hasten that collapse and have a controlled demolition rather than a uh
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:36.760]  uncontrolled demolition that may end up destroying the planet that's their argument behind everything
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:40.920]  they're doing let's go to trade louisiana thanks seth uh you're on the air go ahead

[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:10.280]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist this is the heart
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:20.120]  of 1776 we're back live i am going to try to answer that caller's question in about 1015
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:24.840]  minutes when joe begs leaves us and continue with calls right through the entire next hour
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:31.160]  with a ton of breaking news as well this just broke at info wars dot com and prison planet
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:38.600]  dot com instead of monitoring isis obama spied on americans former pentagon official reveals
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:47.800]  president has been given granular intelligence on the rise of terror group for over a year
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:56.520]  meaning almost none reports judge andrew napolitano you also have former top general
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:01.800]  mccurney coming out saying quote we helped build isis
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:10.360]  isis is al-qaeda under a new name because our government and others were embarrassed over
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:16.680]  openly arming them to attack syria our own military said no last year this time last year it was epic
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:24.360]  thousands of tweets with photos of officers holding signs over their faces saying i will
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:30.200]  not fight in syria for al-qaeda general dimsey went and said no we're not going to be part of it
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:36.600]  it was a real moment of america finding its soul again finding the moral capacity to say no
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:43.160]  we voted down carbon taxes we voted down having open borders we voted down more gun control now
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:52.440]  obama just does it by executive orders so the good news is people are waking up humanity
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.400]  understands we're in a crisis congress has a seven percent approval rating but the establishment
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:02.120]  doesn't care and is moving forward so it's the immovable object running into the unstoppable force
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:07.800]  it's an epic time to be alive right now that's why all you know what is breaking loose around the
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:13.800]  world it's not just here this is a key time to be alive now the heat out there is really raising

[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:46.360]  dhs last week said imminent terror attack on or before september 11th they believe against joint
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:51.000]  task force six and fort blitz biggs has a lot of army connections there he was a staff sergeant
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.440]  that got out about a year and a half ago from the army so he has a lot of connections down there
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:01.320]  and at biggs field named after his grandfather a great grandfather so joe you're down there you've
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:07.080]  got the intel you've got a lot of breaking information for us is this a real threat or are
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:13.480]  they getting ready to false flag or is it just hype or is it people leaking memos who want to
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.360]  draw attention to the fact that our borders wide open we know thousands of other than mexicans
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:24.680]  or other than latin americans as they're called are coming across just there in texas every month
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:29.240]  according to the border patrols own internal documents so what's the real intel joe biggs
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:35.400]  joe biggs here with info wars dot com in el paso texas and like you said earlier alex this is an
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:41.560]  epic time in history that we live in all the stuff is going on right now it's just mind blowing
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.240]  you know the things with russian ukraine our southern borders are wide open
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:52.680]  and have this imminent threat by the ices terror group and war is just behind me you know this is
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:58.120]  crazy we funded them you guys they used to be ices then they became al-qaeda and iraq and then
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:04.680]  they've gone back to ices now that osama bin law is dead you know these guys are brutal people
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:10.360]  they chop people's heads off they crucify them kill people in mass numbers you know the fact that
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:17.000]  the commanding general of four bliss was sat down and briefed about a possible ices threat
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.480]  that says a lot you know my friend is his driver and here's a lot of the things that goes on and
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:28.360]  they take it as a credible threat i spoke to some of the locals here they think it's a credible
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:32.360]  threat as well a lot of them said that they won't even be anywhere around this area come
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:38.120]  september 11th you know and now we have these 11 missing planes out of the olivia airport that's
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:45.160]  been overrun you know crazy we're almost you know approaching our 13th anniversary of the 9 11 attacks
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:51.240]  we have all this stuff going on you know al-qaeda put like an online magazine that states they want
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:56.600]  to hit the uh air force academy they want to hit a military academy in georgia they want to hit
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:02.600]  los vegas and once again uh new york is another target as well time squares so these are very
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:08.200]  trying and they now have 12 passenger jets in working order and have been photographed celebrating
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:13.080]  with them basically saying they're going to kill us with them i mean either way even if it is a
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:18.840]  false flag or if it's real this is something they're going to use to take our our our our liberties away
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:24.680]  plain and simple we saw how easy martial law can be in place in ferguson everybody saw our
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:31.000]  live streams our use streams our videos that were put up for two weeks straight it was so easy
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.960]  overnight for that to happen you know everything that's happening in the world right now as a step
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:40.840]  forward we're moving inch by inch closer and closer to this complete total domination they're
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.480]  going to strip us of everything that we have and it's scary to be in this time but it's also
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:53.080]  historic time in our in our lives well not giving up too much about sources there at the base
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:56.360]  and of course you're not telling you anything you're not supposed to tell you but you talked to
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.920]  your friend he said no we take it very serious uh the joint chiefs had a plan meeting september
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:08.520]  11th in new york they cancelled it two days before back in 2001 uh mayor willie brown told
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:14.520]  connalisa rice not to be in new york that day san francisco chronicle uh anybody can look this up
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:21.160]  show bare minimum when you get told by your one of your sources that no they don't plan to be on
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:26.760]  the base on september 11th uh and then and then you're also going to shield the base uh down to
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:33.560]  two entrances is a huge base uh and all this is going on there they're taking it serious yes you
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:37.560]  know and is with the pentagon as well you know how they had moved a lot of people away from that
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:42.680]  area as well where it was struck so that's kind of a telltale well you know like you said the two
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.080]  main bases they have a sergeant major uh gate which is at big spill and have the big entrance
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:50.920]  those are two main entrances where there's a lot of high ranking people and they close
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.240]  those down they'll have some of the other little smaller ones open where they go into
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.920]  they'll be worried about it so right behind me if you remember there's a spot down here
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:06.120]  where we had filmed where the gate was left wide open i think the board patrol has began to watch
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:10.200]  our videos they now have uh well there was two vehicles earlier they have one vehicle posted
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:15.080]  up right now but last night i was given some information by a lady who's lived her entire
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:21.240]  life she's about 35 years old and right down on the uh this main uh strip of i-10 there's a huge
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:24.760]  part of the fence is completely knocked over so i'm going to go over there and check that out
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:29.240]  but you know i i've talked to some people and people are like oh it's crazy you know el pass
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:33.800]  was very guarded it's the second safest city in the in the u.s there's no way that isis could
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:39.400]  possibly get through well the thing is though is if we created isis and we run isis we're
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:43.800]  going to give them the tools they need to succeed they're a big propaganda weapon this is what's
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:48.040]  to stop them from driving a dump truck full of explosives right up there to the base exactly
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.600]  and people are like no there's no way there's no gaps in our border well i'm going to take
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:57.000]  josh here in a minute to a lot of spots i know this town very well well just right over here
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.120]  there's no fence whatsoever it's the river and there's an american flag and a mexican flag right
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:06.920]  there and you can walk there's no fence whatsoever just on the other side of the dirt line there's
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:11.720]  a store last time i was here there was a guy sitting outside with a sombrero on just hanging out
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:17.400]  that's a you could drive across that the road leads you want to do what uh you want to do
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:23.400]  what project veritas did go to a costume shop dress up in a jihadi outfit and and just was
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:31.320]  just weighed across it's like two feet deep uh you know uh it was man wades across uh has been
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:38.440]  lauding in isis attack zone i mean just just to illustrate to people that okay if it's a real
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:45.720]  threat or a fake threat regardless stop groping us when we fly stop the highway checkpoints
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:51.640]  looking randomly for al qaeda it's ridiculous stop hardening shopping malls and police departments
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.880]  when you won't even control the borders like leave the gate open but then have the guards
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:01.640]  pointing swords at people that live inside the city it makes absolutely no sense we have hd video
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:06.120]  of it we played at the start of the broadcast today but joe tell folks about flying out from
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:14.440]  austin yesterday oh and i wanted to throw up i hate going to that process but the funniest part
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:19.720]  all right so i'm walking up to the tsa checkpoint area and uh i look at the uh the gentleman there
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:25.480]  and i said hey uh i would like to opt out and go through the pat down process and the lady walks
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:30.840]  over from the machine she goes oh sir don't don't worry about it there's no radiation look look at
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:35.160]  the sign it says no radiation just come on through it's better come on just come on through and i
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:40.360]  said no i'm not going through that she goes look at the sign it says there's no radiation though
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:44.520]  and i said well how do i know that's the same machine i saw here the other week when i flew
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.360]  out the only thing that's different is now you have a sign that says there's no radiation that
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:52.520]  does make me feel any better well what about them saving the naked image and by the way there is
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:58.600]  radiation yeah you know they just they've lied and then i went through and the guy's sitting there
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:03.400]  and i said well what what does this do you patting me down and harassing me and as an american citizen
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.360]  what does this do to secure our borders and uh he was like uh uh uh you know and stutter didn't
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:15.000]  really know what to say and then i said well what is there is there truth to the fact that you
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:22.280]  guys are letting you know these undocumented uh legals fly for ID and he said no no no that
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:27.480]  that doesn't happen at all but we know it does we've seen the reports we have the video it's
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:31.880]  admitted we have their own internal documents ordering them to do it yeah and the guy was
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:37.400]  just bald face lying everybody in that entire tsa organization they're a bunch of sigh up
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:41.720]  liars i mean they they they they've sat down they've been briefed for hours and hours they
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:46.520]  know how to run their little game and you know spew forth their propaganda just to make the uh
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:51.400]  the unawake person just ready to jump through that little machine and you know just get radiation
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:57.240]  and get cancer and die they don't want us all to die off you know the fact that we are evil
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:03.640]  people meanwhile we harass hard working Americans citizens who pay into the system
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.960]  and that aren't getting healthcare they deserve and vets are dying you know what is it what is
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:12.840]  this country gone to i mean what are these people doing well sure first they said
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:20.120]  a few months ago that oh uh you know it's only in arizona that their secret list where we deny
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.760]  healthcare to people and let them die veterans of the va then of course it was at every major va
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:28.920]  and then it was well it was a mistake we didn't know then the new york times comes out and goes no
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:34.760]  there are death panels we can't take care of everybody this idea that they're going to decide
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:40.120]  who to give care to that's why you don't want socialist care because it always becomes a rationing
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:45.720]  folks it doesn't work if someone from war is right now comes in our country with a weapon in their
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:51.160]  truck you know what's going to happen oh hey excuse me sir can you come over here uh there's a hospital
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:56.200]  over here you look like you're apart we'll get you some water give you an ivy and uh if you want
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:02.600]  sign up for some education meanwhile our marine goes across in mexico and makes a wrong turn
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.920]  he's been held in jail for five months and our government's doing nothing about it well why are
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:12.600]  they being so racist in me in mexico i mean why don't they you know let him go if they want to
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:17.320]  they want us to take all their garbage but they can't you know do anything to help us out with
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:21.720]  this guy this guy's been stuck over there sergeant tomoresi for five months now i know it's because
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:27.480]  the american people are a joke we put up with anything for them to worry about that's one
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:33.960]  less threat that's why returning vets and veterans are enemies of the state now that's one less they've
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:38.840]  got to worry about that's one less trained marine that they know can stand up and fight that tyranny
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:44.360]  that's why they let the veterans die because they know they don't have the ability to fight back
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:49.800]  when they start getting sick and they aren't being seen this is all a planned orchestrated attack
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:55.960]  on us by the obama administration and the elites that run this entire world this is crazy joe how
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:02.200]  many times have you been to the austin va in the six months you've been here how many times five times
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:07.400]  five times and i haven't had one actual appointment where they do anything for me all i do is i sit down

[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:24.040]  gets scratched they cancel it and then this guy's breaking up because the heat out there
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:29.000]  but uh you know he coughs up blood at night he has to have black sheets because of the blood
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.360]  everywhere and uh he's got you know his knees out he's got shrapnel in his foot and shrapnel and he
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:41.320]  can't get medical care so he has to go and get private insurance and take care of it that way
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:48.040]  and we do have him back so you're saying five times you've gone and then each time they just

[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:25.400]  now the caller it was so epic last night i hadn't been to barton springs but a few times this summer
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:30.120]  so i thought i'd go to barton springs last night this big giant spring fed pool on the side of
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:35.480]  the colorado river there was almost nobody there there all these bats flying around right at sunset
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:45.080]  over the water huge big pink clouds and over the little damn spillway there was just a bunch of
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:52.840]  people that sounded like demons yelling and screaming and laughing and starting fights yelling at
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:59.560]  people over the fence who paid three bucks to get into barton springs proper and they sounded
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:05.560]  and looked like charlie mansons but they were beyond schizophrenics it looked like they were a group of men
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:11.720]  some of a middle age one of molder just basically saying they would that they would kill people ha
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:16.600]  look at you old man they'd see people walk around their swimsuits and make fun of them trying to get
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:24.120]  a rise and finally as they were threatening people the police were called and i thought about every
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:29.560]  time i'm at barton springs the police are over there writing tickets for people's dogs off a leash
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:33.080]  in the area that's where the spillway of the springs come out where you don't have to pay
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:37.960]  a lot of nice folks are over there but there's also a lot of trashy people
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:44.920]  and an instinctive level for about 30 minutes while the sun's setting i just heard the the
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:50.120]  voices and the meanness and the them taunting people until they were told the police have been
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:58.760]  called and they all laughed and left but it was weird i was there with some of my friends and they
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:04.280]  said look just look at the sun setting and the moon coming up look at that that's that's good
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:10.680]  that's god's creation that's heaven this way is hell you can see towards the colorado the city
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:16.760]  the evil city and the night and these people yelling and screaming and saying horrible things
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:24.600]  as the beautiful moon came up in the sunset and it was just an archetype of which way do you want
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:31.240]  to go and without people even saying on both sides of barton springs everyone just turned their backs
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:38.520]  on these people and looked at the sunset and the moonrise and i walked up about 200 yards
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:44.760]  and probably 60 percent of the people i saw there when i say it wasn't busy there are probably
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:50.600]  100 people there instead of a thousand like there are at peak times or more they were all hey alex
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:54.520]  appreciate what you're doing appreciate what your work you know just turn your back on them just don't
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:58:00.120]  look at them and it was like the spiritual moment as everyone turned their backs on these people as
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:04.280]  they yelled for 25 minutes and they were back in the distance and they screamed even louder with
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:10.440]  their hands on the chain link fence like literal demons going look at you old man you're gonna
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:15.480]  die old man look at your speedos and your little such-and-such i'd like to kill you yeah come over
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.360]  here and do something old man come over and and and as a man i wanted to climb over there and
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:25.720]  literally you know cone in the barbarian at an instinctive level tribally 5 000 years ago we
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:29.720]  got together as men and gone over there and dealt with them but see now we're domesticated so we
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:35.720]  call the police to come do it but see they were literally like bad guys out of the road warrior
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:41.000]  that's what these guys were like just truly evil we all turned our backs on them we have to do that
[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:47.960]  we have to fight them speak out against them and also remove our consent at a spiritual level

[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:50.600]  and reberto and natan judy and folks that have been holding you ask either your friends are awake
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:54.600]  or people you know are totally unawake that's that's how the universe works
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:01.000]  you were hot and they're cold so i spit you out of my mouth people to think they take the middle
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.200]  of the road that's where you get run over and if people aren't going to wake up now i would just
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:10.840]  move on from them you want to plant some seeds warn them maybe down the road they're going to listen
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:20.200]  and i grieve and and feel frustrated like i'm like a mouse trying to get out of a cage has
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:26.600]  been thrown into a pond and i kind of overheat on air and i scrabble around and i get upset because
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:31.960]  i know i'm right and i know how epic this evil is that's growing
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:43.000]  and i know that we have really bad people in control and that the elites have just decided
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.280]  to let everything go to hell in a handbasket because it is hard to manage stuff and try to
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:53.240]  have a good world it's hard to take the high road in in in some respects until you've done it long
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:58.760]  enough and then there's you don't know any other way but for people that have learned how to cheat
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:04.120]  you see it's an economy based on cheating and manipulation rather than based on quality
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:07.560]  and a lot of that is just the general decadence of the population
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:13.560]  so we can't just blame the establishment that's why more and more i get emails going hey why are
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:19.000]  you defending the police you're the guy that exposed the police state well yeah i wanted to
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.360]  stop the globalist converting our police to a police state because the globalists are in control
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:30.440]  i'm against that i'm not against the police the police really believe when they're out violating
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:35.000]  rights most the time they're trying to actually protect people and you're not going to wake them
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:41.640]  up just calling them a bunch of scum and then we're gonna end up having a civil war which is bad for
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:47.080]  everybody except the controllers so i don't want to be putting a pin like two roosters to kill each
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:52.600]  other i want to be smarter than that and i'm to blame for letting our government get out of control
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:59.800]  like this and turn our police into this or try to you're to blame i'm to blame for shopping at
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:04.760]  big corporate stores instead of you know trying to thrift stores and farmers markets i mean i do some
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:10.520]  of that but i know the right answers i know how to live i know what to do but i don't do it
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.440]  like i knew everybody was gonna sit there and watch those white trash convict type people call
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:24.760]  people horrible names and just had with it i mean they were demons and i didn't go to my car and get
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:32.200]  my cell phone and call the police but maybe that was the right thing to do it went on for 30 minutes
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:38.520]  they finally did call them and they laughed at everybody and left and half of me was like i don't
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:43.880]  want to call the police and use the system against these people and they but then i knew i said they'll
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.400]  wait criminals don't have to wait they'll wait till they get told the police are coming and then
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:52.200]  they'll leave it was all just their way to be nasty and like the wicked witch showing up at the
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.800]  at the lollipop party and you know urinating in the punch pole
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:01.720]  i mean at a real level justice was when they were messing with every old man or old woman that
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:06.040]  walked by that's what they were messing with the week was to go over there climb over that fence
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:13.160]  and you know pick up i mean you know just but i but i but that was wrong too again it last night
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:20.040]  was a microcosm of just everything else in the world where here's these horrible road warrior like
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:27.720]  animals and then the police come over they're just confused and under pressure and and and
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:31.240]  trying to follow orders and you got the public all sitting there in the middle
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:38.200]  what type of culture produced trash like that i guarantee a trash like that in the old west
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:45.320]  wouldn't have been around very long it's just it's just the decadence of the society has allowed
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:53.000]  evil to grow dishonorable evil there's always been slick and powerful evil but just the weakest
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.360]  most hunchback forms of it are just crawling around everywhere growing i'll come back to you

[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:52.440]  really works and that they've been suppressed into a false paradigm of limited information
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:58.600]  and that the mysteries of the universe are out there for them to discover and to be free men and
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:05.640]  women this is about destiny and that the globalists really do have it out for humanity they really
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:11.640]  have made the decision to be selfish and to dominate and they're bringing in a tyrannical

[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:32.760]  they're banning fireplaces everything that's now being phased in here no one believed that
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:37.080]  they would ban light bulbs here they did no one believed they would bring in green police it's
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:45.800]  happening it's about total control al gore said by 2013 the northern and southern ice caps will

[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:09.640]  things are going on google has come out with a chip that makes machines human app summons drone
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:24.200]  with smartphone operating on brain signals that's afp and it would be fine if the robots were being
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:29.880]  developed and we were creating a future that humanity would be part of the globalists are
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:35.960]  designing the architecture where humanity as we know it will no longer exist that decision has
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:41.400]  been made the world is moving in that direction so you should at least be told about it and at least
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:52.200]  know it bob and then we'll go to um nate and judy and roberto and george thanks for calling bob
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:57.720]  from michigan you're on the air yeah thanks for taking my call i like i hope the signal or the
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:03.240]  audio is okay sounds good um okay i've been listening to you from the very beginning so
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:11.480]  and i was already concerned about the executive orders and stuff way back nixon et cetera and
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:16.920]  told people and they thought i was nuts well they don't think i'm too crazy anymore first of all
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:23.160]  you guys your family yourself and your crew over there in our prayers um this is this is serious
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:31.240]  stuff my big focal point here is this constitutional convention as far as i still know is locked
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:36.680]  and loaded and if they start uh diverting our attention especially to all the craziness that's
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:42.360]  out there right now that you've put up here today um they could go quietly and do this in the middle
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:48.600]  of the night or during a holiday i just want you to know that um and for your listeners that
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:54.680]  that once that is convened the constitution itself is in suspension and that convention
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:12:00.600]  becomes a constitution and everything that i've read and maybe there's an update on this but
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:06.120]  if you look back in some of the old literature i'm sure you can google this uh go look at the
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:12.840]  new state's constitution everything is by privilege and if they feel like it and it uh well yeah it's
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:18.520]  all under un law you have 31 points in the declaration universal declaration of human rights
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:25.080]  and article 30 removes all the rights at the pleasure of the un and the sub secretary generals
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:32.120]  and i've always been against a concon but now via executive power they're shutting off our power
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:39.720]  opening our borders launching military operations putting all this bureaucracy in place going after
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:47.480]  the guns and so it is a lot of libertarian republican movements that are pushing the concon
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:51.320]  to try to block a bunch of stuff but we already have the bill of rights and constitution
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:57.000]  and congress that could be blocking it right now we already have the laws so why would more why
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.400]  would a concon be needed on a balanced budget when they could just pass that in congress why
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:06.280]  would a concon be needed on the second amendment when it's already there i agree it's very risky
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:14.680]  but we're already i'm not endorsing it it's just that we're already so destroyed right now
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:21.320]  that i don't even i mean it's almost like pouring gasoline on a ship it's already on fire i i don't
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:28.360]  know i mean do you think good could come out of it and what do you think no absolutely not i think
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:33.720]  only bad can come from it all we need to do is get some people with a backbone up there and
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:41.640]  dc and tell these people no these executive orders can be rescinded and blocked in 30 days by the
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:47.240]  congress will they do it absolutely not they're all bought and paid for or somehow compromised
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:53.160]  there's just a handful of people out there right now that even understand how to do this i think
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:57.800]  we've been given all the tools we need to fight the tyranny well i agree with you and i've talked
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:02.600]  a lot of constitutional scholars that agree with my two years ago i came up with my new declaration
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:08.680]  independence based on constitution we don't have to as the declaration independence says
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:13.000]  remove this government and and and get rid of this form because it's going to become destructive
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.960]  and it's our right to create a new one the globalist of hijacked america this isn't the republic
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:24.440]  so we simply have the states pull out declare that the federal government's null and void
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:31.880]  and then re upload the system and and have the legislatures vote for who they want to appoint
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.600]  as the new u.s senators that would be rand paul and ted cruise people like that would get elected
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:43.960]  from texas in kentucky and we could basically go back to a pre-1913 upload and and restore power
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:49.560]  to the states equally under a true federalist system not the globalist system we have now
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:55.800]  we're run by by by by a globalist think tank system controlling that the the overpowered
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:00.760]  central government i mean we really do have a collaborator government controlled by offshore
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:05.960]  interest we really are a captured nation we're being used in the exploitation phase like the
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:11.160]  communists do to use american muscle and power to overthrow other countries now we're in the middle
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:18.920]  of a global domination game right now and they've blackmailed congress uh the sky's the limit i mean
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:23.720]  when they put our military under nato command and they openly are melcotted at murder christians
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:29.080]  and they openly get rid of our borders and they openly wave laws and they openly let illegals fly
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:34.360]  but citizens can i mean this is only the beginning that's another we ought to have a whole show about
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:41.320]  if they've gotten away with all this what's coming next because if they've already done all this can
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:48.520]  you imagine can you imagine what's coming now well we know it's arresting libertarians and
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:54.760]  governors and people that aren't complete communist i mean as bad as rick perry is he's
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:16:01.480]  conservative compared to obama or libertarian because he's pro-gun and anti-abortion so why
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:06.600]  not just lock him up i mean they've got enough laws in this country where everybody's committing
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:12.040]  a crime and so everybody just better make a decision which side they're on right now because

[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:22.040]  to just take it over they want to take it over so they can persecute people so they can have their
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:27.640]  way with us they are criminals people say well why do they want to do that because they're a
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:34.280]  bunch of howlin out of control control freaks why would a bunch of white trash thugs want to sit

[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:53.800]  can you imagine what those demons would do if they could actually have their way with people
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:59.080]  if a whole horde of a thousand such scum would come over the hill to your little farmstead
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:03.800]  two thousand three thousand years ago anywhere in the world and what they do to your wife and

[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:26.200]  yesterday absolute trash scum and good people haven't stood up against them and we've let trash grow
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:35.800]  and now we're going to reap the whirlwind folks so sick of it bob thank you nate in north carolina
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:43.640]  you're on the air yay i made it go ahead hey um alex i've got a question for you i'm just i've
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:48.520]  been i'm a relatively new listener i've i've been listening for a few months now and um
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:54.200]  so i have some questions so i'm completely with you i'm pretty much everything you're
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:18:01.080]  talking about um you know i hear what you're saying but then i also hear um things that are
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:07.080]  positive like you know if we can take them on um we we pushed them back on now we're have victory
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:12.520]  when we take action we have victory when we find our soul again but at the same time we're in a death
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:18.760]  battle what i'm saying is it's like it's like tide score in sudden death overtime right now
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:25.240]  with the new world order but we haven't really filled it a team i mean we have a few people out
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:30.680]  there we have a kicker too but so just using that analogy i don't see where we're building a team
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:37.000]  okay so the guy that was on the news on fox general matt McCurney or something yes here's my
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:43.480]  here's my question okay he admitted it we all know it now we know it so where's the the righteous
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:48.120]  people like in the streets doing something about it so we're all you know there's there's those of
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:54.360]  i got reporters in the streets i'm in the streets i hear you i talk about it everywhere i go i mean
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:19:01.000]  i'm you know i don't know people say the government has been taken over so we have to expose it's
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:05.880]  not a legitimate government at the federal level we got to get our states in gear the feds are lined
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:10.440]  up to try to crush states if the states don't get in line because they know that's the legitimate
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:14.840]  avenue to stop this that's why we need to make friends with good people in government see the
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:19.400]  globalists want us to just hate the government and get in a big fight with it because that won't be
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:24.120]  legitimate and that'll bring in a greater tyranny we have to be sophisticated we have to reach out
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:28.840]  to good people in government they have to reach out to us good people and corporations have to
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:34.840]  reach out to everybody else everybody's gotta just affect their own circle come i'm gonna come back

[02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:16.040]  to put boxes on all the cards to access by the mile and that the nsa had big hubs listening
[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:20.680]  to everything we said and did of course it was all public back then it was going on but
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:27.560]  it was buried in the back of government documents so it was easier just to call as conspiracy
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:33.640]  theorists when we warned you now the truth is our naivete has allowed all this to happen
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:40.120]  and now the house transportation infrastructure committee chairman has come out and said user
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:48.200]  fees including lia vehicle miles taxed by the mile is being considered for us highways and the
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:53.800]  boxes now are in all the cars by law and you pay for it in the price of your vehicle by the way
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:25:01.480]  it's a global program cars worldwide now have it unless you're in russia or iran they don't go along
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:07.400]  with it not saying russia and iran are good they just aren't putting cancer viruses in the vaccines
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:11.560]  for their population they haven't bought into the new world order yet they've bought into their own
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:20.280]  systems of corruption but nate in north carolina i mean what is your specific question or comment
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.800]  you're saying you know allows you say some stuff's really positive some stuff's really negative
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:28.760]  yes we have a chance to turn things around but we have to admit
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:37.400]  how bad the system is and how destructive or it's going to use the collapse of its own system
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:43.960]  to bring in an even more evil system we have to expose their program so people are aware of it
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:50.600]  does that make any sense yes and and to be sounding so negative and i'm actually a very
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:56.280]  positive person but um and and i can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's just the bend
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:02.920]  is incredible but um so for me i'm in a situation where me and just a few people are aware to the
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:09.480]  degree that you are and so when you try to talk to anybody else even people that at first you know
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:14.680]  they seem to like have their eyes open to some degree and then very quickly it's you're you're
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:19.720]  aware that not only do they not have their eyes open but they don't even have the vocabulary
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:25.640]  and the understanding i'll tell you what years ago i went to on a um a mission trip to the old
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:30.680]  soviet block and we were we're going into schools and we were talking about the bible and we were
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:35.240]  talking about jesus and guess what we could not take bibles with us because they didn't have
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:41.080]  a foundation of understanding to even get it where the scriptures were so what we did we
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:46.920]  actually just took like books of bible stories to begin to even build a vocabulary that's where
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:52.360]  i feel like i'm at now with people is there's not even an understanding of it no i agree we need
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:27:01.480]  comic books like those chick comic books but but political ones like chick tracks that i'm not
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:05.320]  endorsing all the stuff in the chick tracks the point is is that little tracks that expose the
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:11.000]  neural order how it works how its system operates show that people that are babies to all this
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:16.200]  have a basic awakening and that's something i want to do in publishing is come out with tracks
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.800]  that are basically dealing with liberty issues second amendment you name it that are at cost
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:27.720]  that we can flood out to everybody that's a great idea yeah i mean i'm finding more and
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:31.800]  more people that they must be sensing something's wrong because i'm hearing things like you know
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:36.600]  we'll have to bug out one of these days and i have i found that i have to let that go because
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:41.000]  i asked them like well what do you mean by that and then they don't have any idea what they mean by
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:47.320]  that so it's they have a sense of you know i'm in the city things are looking good i don't know but
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:52.440]  but that's as far as it goes and that's just an incredibly few people so i don't know i'm looking
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:28:00.440]  at it i feel like in a global situation and i'm seeing things are in a dire situation and that
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:08.520]  it's incredibly pervasive there's not one area yes i mean there's not one area where the righteous
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:14.120]  right or whatever i don't know makes made that up is like moving to the forefront and winning i mean
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:19.720]  i don't see one area where we've taken well that's why matt drudge said last year everybody should
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:23.800]  have an emergency exit plan out of this country that's why they're making it so hard to get out now
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:30.920]  i hear you thank you so much nate we're gonna come back go to judy and go to roberto and go to gary

[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:13.560]  or photos of their girlfriend or whatever into the local shop to get developed because
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:17.560]  they wanted privacy why would you upload them to a cloud
[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:25.400]  and again you were the one that reminded me of that and made that point cj that what are people
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:31.480]  thinking i can't possibly begin to imagine what they're thinking except for being lazy
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:36.600]  um we used to have these great little stores in the grocery store in the mall where you can get
[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.360]  your photos developed and family photos were appropriate but if you had any not out naughty
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:48.040]  photos it is a polaroid an expensive device that develops pictures instantly for all you
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:52.680]  young folks that are wondering what a polaroid is well it's also the police state issue
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:57.720]  remember all the cases where it would be like two little girls with towels around them and
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:02.120]  they're hugging each other and they take their kids even though the social workers say there's
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:08.920]  no evidence of sexual abuse uh i mean it's it's it's it's look keep your private stuff private

[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:55.080]  thanks for holding you're on the year hi alex um i wanted to say one thing about joe biggs
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:36:02.280]  in the tsa line and the pat down that he experienced i i really think he used a
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:09.160]  tremendous amount of restraint and was a gentleman because that guy was dominating him
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:15.960]  and liking it oh yeah that guy was a nemesis i mean i i just thought it was disgusting because
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:22.040]  the guy knew who he was i know he knew he was doing it really hard too yeah it was a complete jerk
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:27.240]  it's like he just grosses me out um but i had a chance to see that's government training us to
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:32.680]  that we put there you know we get their hands put on us but then the borders wide open it's just all
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:38.280]  a sick joke but they know they they they know that we know it's a joke but you know even those that
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:44.600]  are halfway away it but it's just i can't believe the domination i mean i do but i don't it's it's
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:52.840]  just ridiculous but um i wanted to you know just bring up um this discussion has been up up to my
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:58.360]  you know being able to talk to you it's been really astounding because i was thinking earlier as i was
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:03.880]  working about how they're basically needs to be like more compassion where where it's you know
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:08.200]  people are concerned because i know the people that i talked to the like customer customers of
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:14.760]  mine are just people in general went when i know when i woke up which was in 2001 when the major
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:20.760]  event occurred that i would for a couple of days i couldn't get out of bed i mean that's how
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:26.120]  devastating how shattered my paradigm was and you know i i wanted to die that's that's how i
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:32.360]  felt like i wanted to die because you know everything that i thought was reality was not and i hear
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:37.240]  people say well you know i'm going to be gone off this earth soon or you know god's going to take me
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:43.320]  or you know oh i just want to bury my head in the sand i mean i hear these terms and it's like
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:47.080]  you know when i look at this but a couple of conversations i've had with men where i see the
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:52.120]  fear in their eyes and it's like i don't know if there's a different way that needs to be developed
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:56.840]  to talk to people you know i i'm no expert well you're right a lot of people you talked about the
[02:37:56.840 --> 02:38:01.800]  neural order they feel so disempowered in their own lives they know stuff's wrong but don't tell
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:06.280]  me about it what can i do well you can stand up for yourself you can have some respect you can help
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:13.160]  other people all of us having a better attitude being a free people will turn this around i've
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:17.880]  talked about you know you know start working on the local level you know i know that i've invited
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:23.400]  rosa quarry to come to my area and hopefully she's going to be able to come in november i mean i'm an
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:28.760]  email correspondence with her now but it's like you know i know a lot of really rich folks that
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:33.000]  have no idea what sustainable developments are all about but i know enough to know they're already
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:38.680]  being affected exactly so you educate them then they learn how they're being scammed they'll start
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:42.440]  standing up against it because if you get the new barish if you get the middle class the upper middle
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:48.360]  class the wealthy aware of what's going on they will then understand the larger paradigm and we'll
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:52.920]  have a new renaissance great points i'm going to go to reberto in new york then i'll go to video
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:59.080]  clips and then back to george and gary reberto thanks for calling you're on the air yes hello
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:05.160]  alex it's a pleasure to speak to you nice talk to you brother yeah i i realized that the globalist
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:11.720]  they they kind of count on us to be non-critical thinkers like um and when you turn on the tv all
[02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:18.200]  you hear about is terrorism terrorism and then when they cover the border it's all about oh don't be
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:23.720]  racist you know you know don't be racist and and that's kind of went to me a father not wanting to
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:29.800]  daughter to get pregnant but giving his daughter a bottle of vodka a hotel room and 500 bucks on
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:35.880]  prom night it just doesn't make any sense it's like a accident waiting to happen and i mean
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:41.400]  bare minimum there's been uh it's come out that the cartels and these extremist groups have been
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:46.840]  in contact talking and i don't understand why it's getting no coverage like no one's making that connection
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:53.720]  i hear you it it's because all these different corrupt cartels whether it's the drug cartels
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:59.960]  the pharma cartels the police state cartels the big banking cartels the Saudi arabian cartels
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:04.360]  they know how to go get influence they know how to buy politicians they know how to
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:08.760]  cut people in on the piece of the action and now corruption is growing and it's just eating up the
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:14.680]  whole economy and now they have agenda 21 in the nanny state meant to you know get patents on hair
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:20.120]  dryers that are low wattage and then you can only buy it from them i mean it's it's it's it's
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:24.840]  where the whole economy is geared where only general electric can have a coal power plant
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:30.760]  nobody else can and we're only you know this company can operate or only mcdonald's gets a
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:35.160]  health care waiver which then makes their food a little less expensive i mean it's just it's it's
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:42.280]  it's a it's a game rig system where the whole world is a cross between las vegas and a gulag
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:47.800]  or the gulag archipelago or the casino gulag that max keiser talks about thank you so much for the
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:54.120]  call speaking of the nanny state and in rosa cora cori and behind the green mask book that we
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:41:03.240]  sell at info wars store.com dealing with government and its takeover worldwide we're under un treaty
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:09.480]  even though we have it signed on to it obama came out this week on monday and he said i will
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:20.280]  put in the carbon taxes on all human activity a value added tax on basically all human activity
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:29.800]  food produce fuel plastic electronics how they can work air conditioning carpeting just just
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:35.000]  everything basically we'll have a carbon tax which also brings in government surveillance
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:42.200]  government compliance where mom and pops can't operate i mean australia has been under this
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:45.560]  five years they crippled them so they're voting it out right now in fact they just did
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:53.640]  but this is about control we'll tell you what you can have in your house we'll tell you what you
[02:41:53.640 --> 02:42:02.520]  can do nothing to do with the environment let's go ahead and go to paul wasen's report the nanny
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:08.600]  state e you has banned many types of vacuum cleaners and is also set to prohibit kettles toasters
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:15.800]  hairdryers and lawn mowers in the latest example of euro crats gone wild two years after a complete
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:21.000]  ban on incandescent light bulbs today store the start of a ban on vacuum cleaners that use over
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:28.200]  1600 watts of power all in the name of preventing global warming that same global warming which
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:34.760]  over the last two years has resulted in an increase in the arctic sea ice cap by 42 percent
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:43.320]  or 5.6 million square kilometers the same ice cap the algore said would vanish completely
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:49.880]  by 2014 but even if you believe in the dogma of man-made global warming this e you ban on
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:56.120]  appliances still makes no sense if you cut the power of hairdryers by a third then what are
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:01.720]  people going to do they're simply going to use their hairdryers for a third longer what kind
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:08.120]  of frigging imbeciles are coming up with these policies the ban on high-powered vacuum cleaners
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:13.880]  or in other words ones that actually work has caused a run on popular models in the united
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:20.200]  kingdom with sales soaring by over 50 percent retailers now face government inspections and
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:27.000]  the prospect of being shut down if they sell anything over a pathetic 900 watts but that's
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:32.360]  not all the european commission plans to impose energy limitations on another 30 electrical
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:38.680]  items next year including toasters lawnmowers and kettles and remember while the eu does its
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:44.200]  level best to hamstring the free market with pointless restrictions that won't even save
[02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:51.160]  energy china and india are building hundreds of coal fired power plants every year this has
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:56.760]  nothing to do with saving energy or saving the planet this is about the nanny state burying
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:03.160]  its tentacles deeper into our private lives choking consumer freedom and strangling a free
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:08.600]  market already laboring under an ongoing recession throughout europe and it's another
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:15.800]  perfect reason to get britain out of the eu if david kameron ever has the balls to graciously
[02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:20.840]  bestow us with a national referendum check out the other videos subscribe to the channel i'm

[02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:40.040]  to mind the 13 planes that vanish from radar in europe due to the reported hack attack highlighting
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:46.680]  a scenario in which commercial jets invisible to radar are purposely crashed into cities and other
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:52.680]  critical infrastructure and that's also a way for them to claim planes disappeared and then
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:57.880]  have them pop back up later back in june two unprecedented blackouts cost 13 planes flying
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.040]  over europe disappear from radar screens leaving air traffic controllers with no information on
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:07.320]  their location speed detection or height and the series of blackouts last up to 25 minutes
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:12.360]  several reports suggested air traffic control systems were hacked according to the telegraph
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:17.320]  planes disappeared from screens for a matter of seconds here and there a german air traffic control
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:22.760]  spokesman said it must have been an external source of disruption yeah they just like on 9 11 their
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:29.880]  screens blacked out or other simulated planes got put in by norad and other centralized DARPA
[02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:35.720]  systems that have control see they have backdoors and the cell phones the cloud your smart meters
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:42.680]  these are the little robots that are in control of everything controlled by skynet the globalist
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:49.400]  eugenicist and so now they're announcing in tokyo robot cops to watch the public robot cops to be

[02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:19.880]  law i have not committed a crime we're suspecting you're okay no i am not harbinger future because
[02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:24.840]  you have no evidence video audio of me having to do you are going off words okay that's why we're
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:29.800]  here to check it out okay there is no fugitive okay we're all neighbors here you need to knock
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:34.760]  on everybody's door okay not if they said they came here okay no they didn't come here okay why
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:39.560]  would she say he came here i don't know you didn't come here i don't know why okay so you're
[02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:44.520]  all neighbors walk away where you walk the way to the back straight to the back i don't know what's
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:51.240]  going on in the back there's another so okay what's going on what's going on i just told you what i
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:55.320]  seen that's it your house get a warrant would you allow us to check your house get a warrant
[02:50:56.200 --> 02:51:03.240]  okay thank you thank you close the door all right i just skipped that network break because
[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:08.760]  this is so important now again those cops overall are being pretty reasonable after they first try
[02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:13.320]  to act like the phones a gun and you know say hey you better watch it i'll drag you out of here and
[02:51:13.320 --> 02:51:17.960]  all the rest of it they then back down and are more reasonable clearly the woman's right there
[02:51:17.960 --> 02:51:26.360]  behind him saying she thinks he went in there and van of the police did see somebody hiding back in
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:31.560]  there they would have probable cause to come in but no court is going to hold that up that this
[02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:37.400]  woman says she thinks he went in there because they're neighbors and then he walked off the point
[02:51:37.400 --> 02:51:46.360]  is do you want people showing up at your door going hey the neighbor thinks that
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:53.720]  he came in here i mean my dad has a neighbor my dad's got four acres in the middle of town
[02:51:54.520 --> 02:51:58.680]  that he bought 20 years ago and now it's got all built up around it
[02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:03.720]  and i'm not trying to be mean these people all have democratic party signs around it
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:09.480]  and i'm just they're incredible control freaks they're always calling code enforcers on each other
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:14.200]  it's just ongoing i met my parents at least you know once every couple of weeks with the
[02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:20.360]  kids swimming their pool and they got like rope swings all kind of stuff it's like a park over
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:27.320]  there and i've been there three times the police have been called one time my daughter was in the
[02:52:27.320 --> 02:52:33.880]  heated pool and my son was filling up the water gun with cold water shooting her and she screamed
[02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:37.960]  it was obviously a little girl screaming having a good time and the police showed up
[02:52:41.160 --> 02:52:45.560]  and literally said well your neighbors said they thought they heard someone being beaten and attacked
[02:52:46.760 --> 02:52:52.840]  and the cops said you know do you just you know mind if i just look in you know your front door
[02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:57.000]  and my dad's right there as we'd already gone in from the pool he looked in everybody was fine
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:01.160]  we just stuck his head he said okay sorry see you later we could know he could have said no no no
[02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:06.040]  you can't but we're just sitting there the front doors right there the living rooms right there
[02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:12.280]  we're sitting there having you know dinner yeah man we're all family everything's fine see look
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:19.800]  but then the cops went down the neighbor was waiting and was sitting there waving their arms
[02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:28.120]  wanting us to get in trouble the other two times there's a neighborhood back behind my parents
[02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:34.920]  where they shoot fireworks and that same neighbor it's always got 15 democratic party signs in our
[02:53:34.920 --> 02:53:42.360]  yard i just think that's interesting calls the cops and they come this is two times i've been there
[02:53:42.360 --> 02:53:46.360]  and we're sitting there barbecuing or whatever hanging out and they're like yeah we got a report
[02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:51.240]  of fireworks we're just going uh-huh my parents have a fire pit out there by the pool we're just
[02:53:51.240 --> 02:54:01.000]  like no we're not shooting fireworks off but that's the country we live in so so much of it is
[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:11.800]  used to you'd have a family unit in a tribe and if some man beat up a woman bad the brother or the
[02:54:11.800 --> 02:54:16.920]  father would come over and deal with them we don't have families like that anymore we have been in
[02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:23.640]  uniforms that show up and i like how the guy points out why don't you go knock on all the doors
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:29.320]  because i've already dealt with this with these neighbors that like to call the police the drop
[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:35.160]  of a hat out in the country where i've got a place in my family
[02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:43.400]  all my neighbors have had the police called on them including myself but they didn't know who
[02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:47.720]  was doing it so they drove by and i was going somewhere so i didn't talk to them if you shoot
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:51.560]  a rifle or shotgun on your own property all these californians we've talked to neighbors
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:55.160]  they're all californians i've been back there shooting a shotgun before with my children
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:01.480]  in the middle of the country and i hear screaming 300 yards away down the creek
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:07.400]  with with a woman and children running and i'm shooting a shotgun the opposite direction
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:12.680]  into a clay embankment shooting targets with my children a 410 and i hear shooting
[02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:19.800]  i mean 300 yards away like screaming bloody murder running up the hill hyperventilating
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:30.200]  a lot of this is just the generation of society and just the absolute mindlessness of it but
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:35.560]  you can err on the side of you let the cops come in let the cops do whatever they want
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:40.280]  that will always turn into a nightmare that's all i'm saying like it's been known for a long time
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:44.920]  the cops want to search your house a lot of warrant they claim a 911 call came in there's
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:49.320]  just a lot of this stuff going on and it's got to be dealt with that's my only point on that front
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:52.680]  i want to go to george and gary with a little bit of overdrive we need to talk to him

[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:21.720]  ahead thanks for calling i thought of three possible solutions to getting these globalists
[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:27.160]  and throwing them back i could call my first suggestion law back the grenades uh basically
[02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:32.120]  taking all their incidents they like the border situation and making it a major incident and
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:36.600]  combining things take the vets take the tea party and people like that they call us all
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:41.960]  uh put on the special list let's all go down to the border have a party uh and basically
[02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:47.400]  seal up the border and all the gun people at the border will have a gun show a barbecue and maybe
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:53.160]  some sort of uh uh you know a concert or something like that make a big thing of it get hundreds of
[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:57.640]  thousands of people to get down there and uh and show that 80 percent of the people it's the number
[02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:02.360]  one issue in the country that's the first suggestion it's a great idea you got to stop the infiltrators
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:08.840]  they'll try to provocateur but yeah and uh second point maybe calling operation break the bubble
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:13.640]  most of these globalists are in the little bubble because they don't have any reaction from from
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:17.960]  these situations what we should do is i suggest hold on stay there george this is genius i want to
[02:58:17.960 --> 02:58:23.960]  come back to you yeah no go to their businesses go to their houses go to their public events
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:29.400]  get tickets to the speaking events and get in their face make them uncomfortable let them know
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:33.960]  you're aware of their program and let everybody else be aware so that when all this stuff comes
[02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:39.240]  down they get the blame they're not going to escape nernberg to not george soros not hillary
[02:58:39.240 --> 02:58:46.520]  clinton when al-qaeda attacks vengazi libya they did this obama and the globalists launched libya
[02:58:46.520 --> 02:58:50.120]  now al-qaeda is running around murdering everybody they need to pay for it
[02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:57.960]  in the near future when you realize how fake it all is the football the basketball
[02:58:57.960 --> 02:59:04.920]  alert security alert this is homeland security analysis info wars building independent medium
[02:59:04.920 --> 02:59:10.680]  operation you let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible prime

[02:59:44.280 --> 02:59:53.720]  about what propaganda they put out intellectually it's become you can fail it coast to coast
[02:59:53.720 --> 02:59:59.880]  direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[03:00:07.240 --> 03:00:12.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[03:00:12.920 --> 03:00:23.560]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[03:00:25.640 --> 03:00:30.680]  i love this headline confusion congressional black caucus campaign against militarized police
[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:39.320]  equipment after voting for it in june more schools across the country are kicking michelle obama's
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:46.680]  program out obama her her school lunch program obama says we will not be intimidated by isis what
[03:00:46.680 --> 03:00:53.640]  a joke folks the globalist help created it's just so sick at some of the stuff up on drudge
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:59.640]  a lot of headlines up on info wars dot com as well uh george in connecticut you were bringing
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:05.640]  up solutions uh go ahead and recap that second one you were getting to yeah the operation break
[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:10.040]  the bubble buff from these uh globalists because once they feel that they are basically people
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:15.000]  know who they are what they're doing uh like you said go to their office things like that but
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:20.200]  other things find out their facts numbers whether it's their business or whatever send them send
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:25.240]  them postcards uh from all around the world so they know that they're they're being uh attacked
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:29.560]  or not attacked but are basically uh being noticed from around the world so that's not just
[03:01:29.560 --> 03:01:34.440]  our country so there's no way they can go uh they want us to know they're watching us we're watching
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:41.800]  them right and then the third point i'm calling uh drone drone the trees and basically maybe make a
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:48.760]  a hundred dollar reward for for uh uh using these uh pro cameras with a with a drone going over these
[03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:53.640]  places where they collect these illegals and stuff or any sort of illegal operation that the globalists
[03:01:53.640 --> 03:02:01.240]  are doing and then record it so that becomes a major issue absolutely record everything become
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:06.520]  your own press confront globalist congress people you name it when they're out in their districts
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:11.880]  calling to talk radio just make the focus being free and fighting this tyranny you'll meet like
[03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:17.640]  minded people it's fulfilling it's it's not exhausting to be involved it's empowering they've
[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:23.000]  sold the idea that being informed being involved is boring no the animating contest of liberty that
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:28.280]  jefferson called it is what it is to be alive god bless you george last caller thanks for calling

[03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:11.640]  police state they talked about terrorism uh mi6 massage cia so all of this is coming true now
