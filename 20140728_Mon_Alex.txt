[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:39.440]  Texas Alex Jones how do you get people out of their conference zone that's
[00:39.440 --> 00:44.600]  really the big question Americans are somewhat awake now to the perils of
[00:44.600 --> 00:50.920]  globalism and the average American the polls show it don't trust government the
[00:50.920 --> 00:55.560]  average American sees the central government as authoritarian even
[00:55.560 --> 01:00.080]  totalitarian but do they really understand what makes the kleptocrats
[01:00.080 --> 01:08.120]  tick and what their ultimate in-game goal is what is that unknown country that
[01:08.120 --> 01:14.160]  history's tyrants are trying to arrive at the truth is that country doesn't
[01:14.160 --> 01:21.520]  exist it is the nature of oppressors that they relish in dominating others and
[01:21.520 --> 01:26.560]  controlling others and it is the nature of those that tend to dominate to not
[01:26.560 --> 01:32.400]  seek out power and control and that is why we are overrun historically time and
[01:32.400 --> 01:38.680]  time again we produce we build civilization and the parasites then
[01:38.680 --> 01:43.600]  take it over hollow it out until it finally collapses yet again and the
[01:43.600 --> 01:52.560]  cycle begins anew we have several guests joining us today he was scheduled a few
[01:52.560 --> 01:58.080]  weeks ago but he'll be popping out about 20 minutes at Neil Shulman alongside
[01:58.080 --> 02:03.000]  night movie is going to be popping in to talk about his dystopic novel he wrote
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.240]  decades ago that's unfortunately coming true then William Gean of Alipak who
[02:09.240 --> 02:13.560]  predicted that Obama would basically in the borders by Fiat when he was on a
[02:13.560 --> 02:18.480]  few years ago with us the head of Alipak will be joining us for about 45
[02:18.480 --> 02:27.040]  minutes in the third hour in the meantime there's obviously a ton of
[02:27.040 --> 02:34.160]  incredibly important news we have two westerners now that have contracted Ebola
[02:34.160 --> 02:41.440]  and Ebola is spreading all over western Africa right now so going on for several
[02:41.440 --> 02:49.800]  months but it's becoming crisis level as well as tuberculosis the black plague
[02:49.800 --> 02:55.920]  and or the black death as it's known it is is also us popping up in the United
[02:55.920 --> 03:01.200]  States we're going to be discussing some of those issues today we'll look at the
[03:01.200 --> 03:06.600]  latest on what's happening over in Israel and Palestine with the situation
[03:06.600 --> 03:10.840]  with the ceasefire breaking down with Hamas North Korea has vowed to nuke the
[03:10.840 --> 03:16.720]  White House maybe we'll send ambassador Dennis Rodman again over there to
[03:16.720 --> 03:21.120]  figure out exactly what's happening also there's a big fight going on over in
[03:21.120 --> 03:27.960]  the UK about designer genetically modified babies that are already being
[03:27.960 --> 03:33.720]  rolled out and of course we'll look at the big issue front and center the end
[03:33.720 --> 03:40.080]  of our borders by the way you know I asked the question how do you get people
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.880]  when they visit a website or listen to a radio show or at a town hall to pay
[03:44.880 --> 03:51.400]  attention do you put your headlines in red occasionally the most sincere form
[03:51.400 --> 03:55.960]  of flattery is imitation so we copy drudge quite a bit sometimes and have
[03:55.960 --> 04:00.080]  really important articles linked up in red people pay more attention to those
[04:00.080 --> 04:05.800]  on info wars.com and prisonpana.com or do you have a siren drudge only does
[04:05.800 --> 04:09.720]  that a few times a year where he has a big red and blue police siren up there
[04:09.720 --> 04:13.280]  you know I think drudge almost should have a siren up there every day right
[04:13.280 --> 04:18.440]  now with the borders imploding and the attempt to start World War 3 with Russia
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.680]  because it's it's that big a deal but but obviously if you had a siren up
[04:22.680 --> 04:29.160]  every single day it would lose its power but this is that time in history
[04:29.160 --> 04:34.000]  where in a hundred-year period you might have a few dozen sirens but then
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.720]  during a four or five-year period when big changes happen the sirens just
[04:37.720 --> 04:42.240]  on continually and I think we're approaching a time societally where the
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.200]  siren is just going to be on non-stop where the artillery bombardment of
[04:47.200 --> 04:51.840]  tyranny against humanity is so great that there aren't any explosions in
[04:51.840 --> 04:57.200]  between just one big din not a boom boom boom boom boom boom but a
[04:57.200 --> 05:02.680]  continual this is Alex Jones for info wars life.com the latest in

[07:08.520 --> 07:12.360]  indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of
[07:12.360 --> 07:16.240]  pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[07:16.240 --> 07:20.320]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42
[07:20.320 --> 07:24.400]  million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold in
[07:24.400 --> 07:28.380]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[07:28.380 --> 07:31.560]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to
[07:31.560 --> 07:35.600]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my
[07:35.600 --> 07:39.800]  lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but

[08:20.080 --> 08:27.360]  does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex joe
[08:38.880 --> 08:47.160]  now we don't cover imaginary ghosts and goblins and vampires and other scary
[08:47.160 --> 08:53.800]  creatures of midnight here we break down the real threat to humanity our own
[08:53.800 --> 09:00.800]  species the dominant species that we know of on this planet six thousand years
[09:00.800 --> 09:07.200]  of recorded human civilization and the number one threat to our species is our
[09:07.200 --> 09:14.120]  own species we call it war we call it crime we call it oppression and because
[09:14.120 --> 09:18.400]  the world is so good and there's so many wonderful things in it so much beauty
[09:18.400 --> 09:26.280]  and art and things worth defending I am here exposing the corruption exposing
[09:26.280 --> 09:32.120]  the evil exposing the threats so that we can recognize the good from the evil
[09:32.120 --> 09:37.920]  so we can have a societal and cultural debate about what is good and bad so
[09:37.920 --> 09:44.440]  that we can recognize it and try to have less corruption less ugliness less
[09:44.440 --> 09:49.880]  oppression in our society the system the modern technocrats in the last hundred
[09:49.880 --> 09:56.120]  years have sold the idea of being submissive politically and not being
[09:56.120 --> 10:01.920]  armed and not having male role models as a way to end violence and end war and
[10:01.920 --> 10:07.160]  the truth is under these models we've actually seen more war and more subtle
[10:07.160 --> 10:12.120]  forms of creeping death and oppression here's the bottom line I want to first
[10:12.120 --> 10:15.680]  talk about today before I get into the giant stacks of vital news and
[10:15.680 --> 10:21.840]  information on this 28th day of July 2014 Monday edition and again I'm your
[10:21.840 --> 10:28.040]  host Alex Jones if you just joined us before I get into all of this I want to
[10:28.040 --> 10:33.760]  quantify something because you can get lost in all the details lost in all the
[10:33.760 --> 10:38.560]  political narratives you can get lost within all the debates of which side
[10:38.560 --> 10:45.200]  are you on coke versus Pepsi Chevy versus Ford Dodge versus Toyota Republican
[10:45.200 --> 10:53.920]  versus Democrat Russia versus the US NATO versus the list goes on and on but
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.480]  when you pull back and look at the technocratic scientific structure behind
[10:58.480 --> 11:03.560]  it when you look at the international agreements the trade agreements the
[11:03.560 --> 11:09.600]  secret agreements when you look at what is outside of the controlled paradigm
[11:09.600 --> 11:17.720]  that's when things really start to make sense and it's so complex many books and
[11:17.720 --> 11:22.200]  white papers have been written that I've read and still countless others that I've
[11:22.200 --> 11:26.280]  not come across because I'm always running into new ones where the
[11:26.280 --> 11:33.120]  establishment is constantly writing manuals for their own minions to
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.240]  understand the paradigm of control because they have trouble getting their
[11:38.240 --> 11:43.560]  own people to understand the scientific dictatorship themselves and there are
[11:43.560 --> 11:47.880]  countless books that break this down tragedy and hope the Anglo-American
[11:47.880 --> 11:56.200]  establishment both by Carol Quigley Zabignan Brazinski's books eco science
[11:56.200 --> 12:02.120]  John P. Holdren the council on foreign relations by monthly publication foreign
[12:02.120 --> 12:08.960]  affairs it's all there they admit in books written in the 60s and 70s that
[12:08.960 --> 12:13.560]  the US government runs almost all global narcotics operations they admit that
[12:13.560 --> 12:18.320]  major governments run the child kidnapping operations they admit that
[12:18.320 --> 12:22.920]  they are ending humanity as we know it but they must first collapse the old
[12:22.920 --> 12:27.880]  system to bring in the new it's all very public they admit they're going to take
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.280]  our children and then our children belong to the state they admit they're
[12:32.280 --> 12:35.360]  putting chemicals in the food and water to make us go into fertility much
[12:35.360 --> 12:40.960]  younger and to basically in sexuality by hyper sexualizing as first it's all on
[12:40.960 --> 12:45.880]  record I've interviewed the scientists the medical doctors the PhDs the
[12:45.880 --> 12:50.400]  sociologists the anthropologists the psychologists the social engineers the
[12:50.400 --> 12:54.840]  admin the corporate people the billionaires the head of the Kissinger
[12:54.840 --> 12:59.680]  group the congressman the senators the movie stars in 20 years of fighting
[12:59.680 --> 13:06.240]  these people I have interfaced with them and what I tell you is not my opinion
[13:06.240 --> 13:13.840]  what I tell you is the spectrum of grounded analysis of the world of those
[13:13.840 --> 13:21.200]  that live and those that sleep they live we sleep and so if you're watching us on
[13:21.200 --> 13:26.400]  info wars news.com or prisonplanet.tv if you're a news subscriber or you're
[13:26.400 --> 13:31.840]  watching us on the free feeds at info wars.com forward slash show if you're a
[13:31.840 --> 13:37.200]  radio listener you can go there and you can see that I took my children to a
[13:37.200 --> 13:42.760]  laser blazer tag place this weekend and they want a bunch of tickets in the
[13:42.760 --> 13:48.920]  arcade playing foosball and things and so one of the prizes for a thousand
[13:48.920 --> 13:53.960]  tickets was a police siren and it made me think of the drudge report when my
[13:53.960 --> 13:58.360]  son decided he wanted this for the thousand plus tickets he'd won and I
[13:58.360 --> 14:04.880]  thought you know drudge puts a siren up a couple times a year to symbolize
[14:04.880 --> 14:11.440]  something huge something bombshell something absolutely gigantic that he
[14:11.440 --> 14:18.800]  believes will be seismic he red links things that are new on a weekly basis
[14:18.800 --> 14:24.000]  that are important we do the same thing again the greatest form of flattery is
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.040]  imitation but how do we culturally and societally get people to see a big siren
[14:31.040 --> 14:36.560]  above their heads or a big light bulb to go off and say you know a lot of what
[14:36.560 --> 14:44.600]  this guy talked about years ago has come true we might want to actually look
[14:44.600 --> 14:49.840]  into it because if 1% of what he's saying is true or 10% of what he's
[14:49.840 --> 14:56.720]  saying is true we are in serious trouble but if you feel like you don't have any
[14:56.720 --> 15:00.200]  power you just say I'll say lobby why does it matter what you have to
[15:00.200 --> 15:07.760]  understand is it is animating it is the great contest of life to survive and to
[15:07.760 --> 15:11.680]  thrive and to build and to innovate that's the good side of humanity that
[15:11.680 --> 15:20.200]  way outweighs the bad side but when good men and women refuse to see the sirens
[15:20.200 --> 15:26.600]  refuse to see the red flags refuse to see the riding on the wall the entire
[15:26.600 --> 15:33.240]  world slides deeper and deeper towards the abyss and in the past tyrannies
[15:33.240 --> 15:39.120]  would just fall via their totalitarian total oppression it's the very nature
[15:39.120 --> 15:44.760]  of them but now with the high-tech overlay the GMO the genetic engineering
[15:44.760 --> 15:50.680]  the over-the-horizon predictive systems that are near crystal ball level of the
[15:50.680 --> 15:57.800]  Google flash NSA Microsoft Apple interfaces the elite have been given
[15:57.800 --> 16:02.960]  powers that to the ancients would be considered beyond anything Zeus could
[16:02.960 --> 16:10.760]  even imagine they have Promethean fire squared but they are the worst of the
[16:10.760 --> 16:15.600]  worst of our species I don't care if they're communist Chinese elite whether
[16:15.600 --> 16:19.680]  they're German elite whether they are Mexican elite whether they are US elite
[16:19.680 --> 16:24.200]  whether they are Israeli elite whether they are Muslim elite Arab elite
[16:24.200 --> 16:30.440]  African elite you have two different types of government and a couple years
[16:30.440 --> 16:33.880]  ago I first said this is a national Suza and then I said it again to him and he
[16:33.880 --> 16:38.760]  was on a few months ago and I was listening to to Fox News driving back
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.480]  from dropping my son off at camp in each Texas I was driving back to Central
[16:43.480 --> 16:48.760]  Texas last night and I was listening to different news channels on XM and I was
[16:48.760 --> 16:53.160]  listening to Huckabee and he had a national Suza on and a national Suza
[16:53.160 --> 16:56.840]  said there are two types of government in the world when you really boil it down
[16:56.840 --> 17:01.640]  there are governments of innovation and wealth creation and there are
[17:01.640 --> 17:06.200]  governments of conquest and oppression and you can call it conquest oppression
[17:06.200 --> 17:12.680]  rule of gangs whatever you want that's tyranny and then there's government by
[17:12.680 --> 17:18.680]  renaissance government by innovation government by wealth creation and those
[17:18.680 --> 17:24.280]  were exact quotes of me being uttered by Dinesh to Suza on Fox News and by the
[17:24.280 --> 17:29.160]  way I didn't get irritated at the national Suza he may not even know that
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.560]  those that those are quantified statements that I have coined based on
[17:33.560 --> 17:37.360]  many other people's research as well I mean we're all connected to each other
[17:37.360 --> 17:42.480]  we all steal from each other it was a great flattery to hear my words coming
[17:42.480 --> 17:49.600]  out of his mouth as I do all over the place now I don't personally even want
[17:49.600 --> 17:58.080]  the credit because it's dangerous to get it I just sit back and smile in the
[17:58.080 --> 18:06.880]  dark alcove and look out into the street and and and see my understanding
[18:06.880 --> 18:11.040]  which is basic rediscovery of renaissance liberty understanding I
[18:11.040 --> 18:14.960]  mean I can read writings of the founding fathers I can read writings of
[18:14.960 --> 18:21.120]  Alexander Sultz and Eatson I can read writings of ancient philosophers Cicero
[18:21.120 --> 18:26.560]  who love liberty and it's everything I've thought everything I believed because
[18:26.560 --> 18:34.840]  it's true 2,000 years ago 25 years ago a hundred years ago a month ago it
[18:34.840 --> 18:42.880]  resonates because it is veritas it is truth and that's why the system wants to
[18:42.880 --> 18:51.880]  suppress human liberty and wants to label tyranny as human liberty so let
[18:51.880 --> 18:56.520]  us all awaken together not even to the same truths but to the truths that we
[18:56.520 --> 19:00.720]  share together that resonate in the human breast and let's wake up the fact

[24:55.280 --> 24:59.600]  but looking at the big picture the reason I tell you about the success of
[24:59.600 --> 25:04.600]  info wars a few times a week is because our success is your success and the
[25:04.600 --> 25:11.880]  success of the new media is a boon to all of us we are together we are brothers
[25:11.880 --> 25:16.800]  and sisters regardless of race color creed religion in the fight for human
[25:16.800 --> 25:22.560]  dignity and being honorable that's really the only possession that matters in
[25:22.560 --> 25:26.320]  the final equation is that and of course family and that's not a possession
[25:26.320 --> 25:31.440]  that is part of the continuum of humanity and we're all a family when you
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.480]  look at it in that context and the system uses and manipulates the good will
[25:36.480 --> 25:43.440]  of good men and women to guilt us into going along with what they want us to do
[25:43.440 --> 25:50.280]  and once they create a guilt complex in you as a young child showing
[25:50.280 --> 25:55.000]  watershed down the rabbits dying because of a housing development being
[25:55.000 --> 26:01.000]  built you hate your humanity and see yourself as a bad person for the rest
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.760]  of your life and now you've got to go through the high priest of the controlled
[26:05.760 --> 26:13.040]  left to prove yourself with indulgences that you pay to them you have to prove
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.360]  yourself through political correctness that you are sanctified it's a new form
[26:18.360 --> 26:22.400]  of religion it's the same thing with other systems of political correctness
[26:22.400 --> 26:27.000]  racism why if you don't support totally open borders you're a racist if you
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  don't support Obamacare that hammers poor people and has death panels you're
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  a racist if you don't just support the state taking control of children you're
[26:37.000 --> 26:45.160]  a racist again these are all forms of hin pecking you and bullying you and
[26:45.160 --> 26:49.120]  making you feel guilty when you've done nothing and then you look at who's
[26:49.120 --> 26:56.760]  pushing these ideas it's a bunch of Ford Foundation operatives it's a bunch of
[26:56.760 --> 27:02.400]  CIA operatives it's a bunch of social engineers it's a bunch of FBI informants
[27:02.400 --> 27:10.080]  like Al Sharpton shining us on to their agenda do you remember this lady MSNBC
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.880]  host compares illegal immigration opponents to race segregation advocates

[27:25.280 --> 27:29.000]  segment on her Saturday show the host like in Texas Governor Rick Perry's
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.160]  decision to send National Guard troops to the border to Arkansas governors move
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.840]  back in the 50s to use guard troops to prevent black children from attending
[27:38.840 --> 27:44.720]  little Rock Central High School by the way it was a Republican Eisenhower that
[27:44.720 --> 27:51.160]  sent the troops in and by the way Rick Perry is a globalist on record for
[27:51.160 --> 27:55.640]  anybody I live here I know Rick Perry personally he's been on this show he's
[27:55.640 --> 27:59.600]  come over and tried to get me to join forces with him at my table at Laueva
[27:59.600 --> 28:05.520]  Leon Mexican food restaurant I know Rick Perry he sent his representatives to
[28:05.520 --> 28:09.760]  talk to me repeatedly hey I know Rick Perry for hopefully he's been governor

[28:17.120 --> 28:20.360]  control but the point is this is how they get conservatives to supporting this
[28:20.360 --> 28:24.880]  is how the bait and switch works Perry is gonna send the guard who will then
[28:24.880 --> 28:29.480]  deliver the kids who are calling 911 that's in the Associated Press to ICE
[28:29.480 --> 28:35.600]  who will then legalize them they're set this month to issue five million work

[34:09.400 --> 34:14.720]  looking at all the different channels that carry your material undoubtedly you
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.600]  are the biggest operation on YouTube when it comes to political news and
[34:19.600 --> 34:22.840]  information we want to work with you people say well what does that mean
[34:22.840 --> 34:26.200]  when YouTube wants to work with you it's a division of Google well the average
[34:26.200 --> 34:31.320]  compartmentalized person at YouTube is not a bad person and and we have to be
[34:31.320 --> 34:36.640]  ready for success we have to be ready to supplant the old order which is
[34:36.640 --> 34:42.880]  tyranny with the really old order that is beating on the human breast liberty
[34:42.880 --> 34:48.200]  again with all of our official channels together we've got about 600 million
[34:48.200 --> 34:54.320]  views you count some of the other channels conservatively 800 million
[34:54.320 --> 35:01.760]  views 800 million views and I'm not trying to brag here today I want you to
[35:01.760 --> 35:08.520]  know out there that we are just one operation promoting freedom and there
[35:08.520 --> 35:12.440]  are literally hundreds and hundreds of other channels outpost of liberty on
[35:12.440 --> 35:17.400]  YouTube that have got 10 million 20 million 50 million 60 million a hundred
[35:17.400 --> 35:22.880]  million views that have only been around a few years and when I see some talk
[35:22.880 --> 35:28.920]  show host or some documentary maker who's doing a better job than I am we
[35:28.920 --> 35:38.840]  highlight those videos on info wars calm and prison planet calm I get excited
[35:39.440 --> 35:44.440]  about finding other YouTube channels that are promoting liberty and in some
[35:44.440 --> 35:47.960]  cases I think doing a better job than I did and then sometimes I'll see they've
[35:47.960 --> 35:51.520]  got a little hit piece on me or something but overall there's not a lot of
[35:51.520 --> 35:56.440]  hit pieces on there and so I'm I'm very pleased because I don't care about
[35:56.440 --> 36:02.200]  being attacked that's a mark of being successful and your children will also
[36:02.200 --> 36:06.360]  basically later in life try to differentiate and rebel against you
[36:06.360 --> 36:10.480]  and so I've woken up and my listeners have woken up this operation has woken
[36:10.480 --> 36:15.120]  up so many tens of millions of people conservatively worldwide tens of
[36:15.120 --> 36:20.520]  millions in the US alone that I expect people to go through that differentiation
[36:20.520 --> 36:25.280]  period where they will then see the fault in me because we all have fault or
[36:25.280 --> 36:31.000]  the distorted fault and will be angry with me and I totally understand and I
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.440]  think everyone out there who does try to reprove me you know some people say

[36:51.080 --> 36:55.880]  get the speck out of your eye I tell you to try to be a good person and to try
[36:55.880 --> 36:59.000]  to stand up for human liberty and freedom you're not gonna hear these
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.240]  megachurches talking about going to the abortuaries and trying to stop
[37:02.240 --> 37:05.880]  abortions you're not gonna hear these big megachurches speaking out against
[37:05.880 --> 37:09.560]  Obama or the open borders or global government you're gonna see them
[37:09.560 --> 37:14.360]  promoting it but talking all day about how good they are and how you can name
[37:14.360 --> 37:22.040]  it and how you can claim it so I never said that I wasn't wicked as the day is
[37:22.040 --> 37:28.560]  long let's get that straight and I like the energy of Metallica or Megadeth you
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.520]  know Dave Mustaine is a Christian you know coming in I have found that people
[37:32.520 --> 37:36.840]  that are open about their dark side or who I want to be around let me tell you
[37:36.840 --> 37:40.160]  you better watch is people that act like they're holier than they are and act
[37:40.160 --> 37:44.480]  like how good they are all day and lecture you all day about how you're a
[37:44.480 --> 37:49.400]  devil you better watch them real close because the devil masquerades as an
[37:49.400 --> 37:55.080]  angel of light ladies and gentlemen I've got strong flesh that's why I
[37:55.080 --> 37:59.960]  understand the globalist because because I can tune in to darkness ladies
[37:59.960 --> 38:07.320]  and gentlemen but my heart loves God and my heart loves the innocent and my heart
[38:07.320 --> 38:13.400]  loves justice and I'm ready to die before I screw anybody over and before I
[38:13.400 --> 38:17.240]  abuse the ignorant and before I do anything to the children suffer the
[38:17.240 --> 38:20.360]  little children better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw
[38:20.360 --> 38:24.160]  yourself in the sea and who are the children they're the handicaps they're
[38:24.160 --> 38:29.120]  the veterans they are the little children they're the old people the
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.720]  children are people that are under your control the children are people that are
[38:33.720 --> 38:40.560]  in your stead that are in your care that that that you're a steward of our
[38:40.560 --> 38:45.160]  veterans children know but they're treated like children by the system and
[38:45.160 --> 38:49.800]  put into a position where they're treated like children treated like they
[38:49.800 --> 38:54.760]  are basically been declared mentally unfit so part of it is we have to break
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.560]  through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids
[38:58.560 --> 39:01.440]  belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[39:01.440 --> 39:05.840]  once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households then we start
[39:05.840 --> 39:09.720]  making better investments if you look at what the technocracy and monsters like
[39:09.720 --> 39:15.160]  Melissa Harris Perry are doing they are declaring all of us unfit they are
[39:15.160 --> 39:22.280]  declaring all of us malfunctioning they are declaring all of us to be
[39:22.280 --> 39:28.280]  institutionalized they're declaring us incompetent that's what the whole
[39:28.280 --> 39:35.160]  welfare system criminal justice system media system college system all of it
[39:35.160 --> 39:43.280]  is about declaring you unfit declaring you incompetent and they run the sigh
[39:43.280 --> 39:47.160]  up and put the troops on drugs early and put them in too many tours and then
[39:47.160 --> 39:50.200]  tell them they're mentally ill but don't worry you'll get your benefits as long
[39:50.200 --> 39:54.640]  as you waive your rights and say you have PTSD and then run this operation I
[39:54.640 --> 39:58.040]  can't tell you how many vets I know who finally got off all the serotonin
[39:58.040 --> 40:03.320]  re-uptake inhibitors the SSRIs and the opiates that they put them on and look
[40:03.320 --> 40:07.800]  ten years younger and are healthy and understand the mind game that was played
[40:07.800 --> 40:10.880]  on them and understand the way to get better is to realize they're in an
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.960]  infall war against the globalist and the innocents need them and sure they were
[40:14.960 --> 40:18.000]  rode hard and put away wet but they're not gonna let the globalists run that
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.280]  mind game on them they're gonna break their conditioning and decide they have
[40:21.280 --> 40:27.240]  value and not buy into the psi off that something's wrong with them nine times
[40:27.240 --> 40:31.320]  out of ten the troops I personally know the veterans I know can reverse that
[40:31.320 --> 40:37.320]  mind game by helping others and getting back in the game this time for the
[40:37.320 --> 40:44.320]  battle for the Republic so this simpering snake this fascist authoritarian
[40:44.320 --> 40:49.440]  kleptocrat literally using psych warfare from the Ford Foundation where she was
[40:49.440 --> 40:54.600]  trained and the Obama administration the Clinton administration to savagely go on
[40:54.600 --> 40:59.400]  television and brutalize quote minorities who are the majority now in most
[40:59.400 --> 41:03.200]  areas of the country and tell them that whites are their enemies and tell them
[41:03.200 --> 41:06.520]  that anyone that doesn't want a North American Union and totally collapse
[41:06.520 --> 41:10.560]  borders and tens of millions of people here having their babies for free and a
[41:10.560 --> 41:15.720]  huge new political welfare class that anyone that doesn't wholesale run up a
[41:15.720 --> 41:22.280]  white flag to her is a racist your kids belong to us or your racist the
[41:22.280 --> 41:26.920]  borders are wide open are your racist and she sits there flogging it you can
[41:26.920 --> 41:30.920]  watch them read the teleprompters like literal generals turning to each other
[41:30.920 --> 41:34.960]  and then and then nodding to each other as they savagely run their op these
[41:34.960 --> 41:39.280]  people are so wicked you can't even imagine the operations they're running
[41:39.280 --> 41:43.560]  they are high-fying the bring down of this country they're not liberal ideologues
[41:43.560 --> 41:49.320]  it mean well they are commandos they are psych warfare generals that is not
[41:49.320 --> 41:54.800]  rhetoric they will attack and attack and attack they are the enemy of you and
[41:54.800 --> 42:00.960]  your family 110 percent and until you realize that they are trained military
[42:00.960 --> 42:04.880]  might of the National Guard to defend ourselves against them could we please
[42:04.880 --> 42:10.760]  pause for a moment here and remember that we are talking about children who
[42:10.760 --> 42:15.440]  are vulnerable unprotected and afraid who are fleeing extreme violence and
[42:15.440 --> 42:19.720]  poverty in their home countries drawn to the United States border by our nation's
[42:19.720 --> 42:24.040]  reputation as a place where children are valued precious and protected and to
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.400]  some extent what they have found here is as good as what is advertised there
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.440]  are people of the Rio Grande despite being at the epicenter of the surge in
[42:33.440 --> 42:36.800]  children and families crossing the border have stepped up to support their
[42:36.800 --> 42:40.560]  region's strained resources with thousands of hours of volunteer time
[42:40.560 --> 42:45.480]  food shelter and emotional support for the migrant kids then there was
[42:45.480 --> 42:49.760]  Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick who last week offered temporary shelter for
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.200]  up to 1,000 unaccompanied minors citing what he called America's century-long
[42:54.200 --> 42:58.680]  tradition of giving sanctuary to desperate children and if we look to
[42:58.680 --> 43:01.680]  that history we do indeed see there are moments when children have been the
[43:01.680 --> 43:05.960]  catalysts that moved Americans to push beyond their own biases and borders
[43:05.960 --> 43:11.200]  both national and racial in May of 1963 the Children's Crusade organized by the
[43:11.200 --> 43:14.360]  Southern Christian Leadership Conference brought more than 3,000 young people
[43:14.360 --> 43:18.960]  to the city of Birmingham, Alabama in a show of civil disobedience against
[43:18.960 --> 43:23.400]  segregation in the city once Americans saw those images of children standing
[43:23.400 --> 43:27.760]  courageously against injustice the tide of national public opinion took a
[43:27.760 --> 43:32.000]  pivotal turn in support of the civil rights movement's cause but we can't
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.360]  embrace that moment of America's moral fortitude without also owing the great
[43:36.360 --> 43:41.180]  more owning the great moral failing to which it was responding because the
[43:41.180 --> 43:44.760]  children at the border have also been confronted with a hostility that is as
[43:44.760 --> 43:48.920]  old as the segregated South and just as American as the grace and charity of
[43:48.920 --> 43:53.960]  those to who have extended a hand of help and if we are to claim our history
[43:53.960 --> 43:57.040]  and protecting vulnerable children we must also grapple with our history of
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.320]  responding to them as a threat when their presence undermines an established
[44:01.320 --> 44:05.240]  order as much as Americans rallied to the cause of the Children's Crusade it
[44:05.240 --> 44:08.920]  was also agents of the American state that were willing to attack them with
[44:08.920 --> 44:12.880]  armed officers fire hoses and police dogs when they challenged a deeply
[44:12.880 --> 44:17.480]  entrenched way of life in the South Rick Perry was preceded in his call to send
[44:17.480 --> 44:23.000]  armed troops to confront children by Arkansas Governor Orville Fobis and he
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.440]  of course called the National Guard to stop the Little Rock Nine from their
[44:26.440 --> 44:31.480]  first day of school at Central High that's enough then she goes into Rick
[44:31.480 --> 44:39.960]  Perry again as she began Rick Perry has put a thousand border patrol National
[44:39.960 --> 44:47.840]  Guard down there to simply give the the illegals most of them are adults to the
[44:47.840 --> 44:52.480]  Border Patrol and ICE who then give them green cards and work permits that's on
[44:52.480 --> 44:57.320]  record so see this is how they give left cover to the controlled Republican
[44:57.320 --> 45:02.320]  Party you got conservatives saluting Rick Perry everywhere for quote putting a
[45:02.320 --> 45:08.000]  thousand troops down there but all they're doing on record we played the
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.920]  clip last week is responding to the 911 calls and helping the police and state
[45:12.920 --> 45:18.160]  police that are overwhelmed give the illegals to ICE who then promptly
[45:18.160 --> 45:24.200]  legalizes them it's in the headlines today amnesty work permits for five
[45:24.200 --> 45:34.840]  million ordered within weeks la times visa overstays to be excused la times I
[45:37.240 --> 45:42.760]  mean this is what's going on and it's ms-13 and its adults and its smugglers
[45:42.760 --> 45:48.760]  inside of these facilities with the teenagers average age 15 using them and
[45:48.760 --> 45:52.760]  they don't even have real names a lot of these kids are being exploited and used
[45:52.760 --> 45:56.400]  and being invited up here by the Democratic Party who went down to
[45:56.400 --> 46:01.160]  Guatemala a year ago to set this up and Mexico telling them come here come here
[46:01.160 --> 46:04.280]  have your babies come here here we'll put you on birth control because you're
[46:04.280 --> 46:09.200]  getting pregnant we're gonna wave all of our laws and invite wave after wave
[46:09.200 --> 46:13.240]  effectively getting rid of our border and if you don't do it you're like a
[46:13.240 --> 46:21.000]  Democrat governor in Arkansas trying to keep black kids out of school so that a
[46:21.000 --> 46:28.320]  Republican president stops you and then you put up this this this technician
[46:28.320 --> 46:37.000]  Perry Melissa Harris Perry who says your kids belong to you know the state they
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.400]  put her up there to say you are collectively racist if you don't want
[46:42.400 --> 46:46.240]  to legalize the children and they show shots of three and four-year-olds lying
[46:46.240 --> 46:57.480]  on cots and sleeping bags who encourage this we didn't make Guatemala be a total
[46:57.480 --> 47:03.120]  hellhole we didn't make Venezuela be a total hellhole the whole world's being
[47:03.120 --> 47:12.160]  told you come to America the children are there to be shipped to America you
[47:12.160 --> 47:17.000]  live in a country the children live there then America is supposed to take
[47:17.000 --> 47:22.320]  the children America exists to take the children remember Obama two weeks ago
[47:22.320 --> 47:28.760]  came out and said that the United States and his administration has spread just
[47:28.760 --> 47:35.320]  absolute stability and happiness all over the world remember that here's the
[47:35.320 --> 47:39.640]  exact headline White House we substantially improve the tranquility of
[47:39.640 --> 47:44.920]  global community the truth is the world is melting down under global
[47:44.920 --> 47:49.920]  devaluation of the dollar that the globalist have carried out all other
[47:49.920 --> 47:53.320]  major currencies pegged to the dollar are being devalued at warp speed right
[47:53.320 --> 47:59.560]  now the planet is descending into new world order destabilization the IMF
[47:59.560 --> 48:03.440]  World Bank admitted program is a destabilized third-world countries and
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.000]  the genetic states and use those crises to bring in a planetary
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.920]  technocracy but the average person doesn't know that they just say look at
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.200]  images of white men in a few isolated cities with police dogs biting black
[48:16.200 --> 48:23.280]  people well if you don't accept totally open borders the North American Union
[48:23.280 --> 48:29.400]  you want police dogs to bite black people that's the mindless level of the
[48:29.400 --> 48:35.520]  psychology that they're using and they plan to fully break the border and bring
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.920]  in unlimited groups who are not skilled who are not middle-class who will work
[48:40.920 --> 48:45.800]  for the Democrats and who will work as basically minimum wage slaves getting a
[48:45.800 --> 48:50.360]  supplemental of welfare that's the new model making them totally dependent and
[48:50.360 --> 48:55.840]  they will vote however they're told this is the conquest of America and the
[48:55.840 --> 48:59.400]  conquest of our children and everything else and if you want to be a slave and
[48:59.400 --> 49:03.400]  if you want to allow these people to be brought here and be exploited then
[49:03.400 --> 49:08.080]  support what this monster is putting out now this is an example of the left hand
[49:08.080 --> 49:11.320]  not knowing what the right hand's doing Madeline Albright the secretary of state
[49:11.320 --> 49:18.440]  under Clinton told CBS face the nation that the world is a mess no no no Obama
[49:18.440 --> 49:23.000]  and the Democrats have brought tranquility here it is happening in the
[49:23.000 --> 49:28.840]  Middle East a lot of it due to the Arab awakening and also the artificiality of
[49:28.840 --> 49:33.080]  the borders that were established after World War one so these are huge game
[49:33.080 --> 49:37.640]  changers and we are a lot of Americans trying to figure out where the countries
[49:37.640 --> 49:41.840]  are most Americans knew very little about Islam they certainly didn't know a
[49:41.840 --> 49:45.840]  difference between she and Sunni so there are an awful lot of things going on
[49:45.840 --> 49:51.040]  that need understanding and explanation but to put it mildly the world is a mess
[49:51.040 --> 49:56.560]  to put it mildly the world is a mess and who's behind the Arab Spring on record
[49:56.560 --> 50:06.360]  Madeline who was behind that oh on record Google the Ford Foundation the
[50:06.360 --> 50:12.200]  Soros group open societies Soros Braggs he's behind that he's behind Ukraine
[50:12.200 --> 50:16.400]  overthrowing that government starting all that and behind the open borders here
[50:16.400 --> 50:21.560]  but you heard her the solution is not having borders at all that's right
[50:21.560 --> 50:27.280]  overthrow Saddam a stabilizer and now let Al Qaeda take over much of that area
[50:27.280 --> 50:35.280]  you see they create the crisis and then they offer the solution but at least she
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.040]  told the truth one little truth in there that the world's a mess yes they have to
[50:39.040 --> 50:45.560]  create a mesh to then bring in their solution a water war with Russia a another
[50:45.560 --> 50:50.680]  invasion of Iraq another invasion of North Africa oh we got to have our
[50:50.680 --> 50:55.200]  troops in Africa because of Al Qaeda who our government put in there who gave
[50:55.200 --> 51:00.720]  them the heat-seeking missiles our government next to water and food you

[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.240]  Alex Jones
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:40.520]  the brazenness the nakedness the arrogance the hutzpah the bravada the
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:48.240]  hubris the sickening feeling of invincibility that these wicked wicked
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:56.080]  social engineers who want you in povers to want you down you know I've seen this
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.000]  statistically but I've experienced it in my life as well that environmentalists
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.240]  people that claim their big do-gooders are six times more likely to steal in a
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:10.600]  Canadian study even more likely to steal in a British study London Guardian
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.560]  reported on how rude they are how they steal but I found this also with
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.880]  Christians that tell you what great Christians they are and are always
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:25.440]  telling you that you aren't a good Christian they use it as a moral authority
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.000]  I would like them to the money-changing Pharisees that Christ whipped in the
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.320]  temple and time and time again if somebody tells me what a good Christian
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:41.200]  they are and tells me I better watch it because I might be of the devil they're
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.520]  not really reproving me it's a certain spirit I pick up on it right away and
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:51.320]  then they end up being the thieves they end up being the criminals they end up
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.000]  being the bad people yeah there it is how going green might make you mean
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.960]  ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to steal study
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:07.680]  fines and again this is a real phenomenon and when you see the folks on MSNBC
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:17.280]  CNN they know what they're doing they study propaganda they study
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.320]  disinformation and they are literally wanting to keep you politically on
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:31.960]  their plantation on their reservation under their control and I know most of
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.440]  you are aware of that most of you understand that we have a guest in the
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.480]  culture wars joining us a filmmaker with a hot new film coming out based on his
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.720]  book written decades ago that predicted a dystopia so I want to compare the the
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.400]  dystopia he envisioned in his mind to the dystopia we're now entering into
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:57.640]  today for a couple segments and then we will open the phones up at the bottom
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:03.560]  of this hour I didn't really plug properly either I hate to get sped up on
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:08.160]  the show and then not properly plug things I was talking about the
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:17.080]  proprietary pure non-gmo highest standards trailblazing supplements at
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:22.200]  info wars life comm as we went to break earlier and despite the fact that I have
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:29.320]  a highly stressful lifestyle despite the fact that I do a lot of things that
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.720]  obviously aren't good for my body and have been through a lot in my life as
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:39.240]  well that I won't get into it has been life-changing what the proprietary x2
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.000]  and and regular survival shield have done for me what the supermail
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.320]  vitality has done what the lung cleanse has done when I have a sore throat or
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.920]  something with the colloidal silver if it's bacterial what that's been able to
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:56.120]  do for me it's just amazing and and again we did sell out of a silver
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.160]  bullet the last time we produced it didn't have it for two and a half months
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:04.120]  at the current rate of sales we will sell out very very soon so if you want
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:10.040]  this I mean the best we could get the best produce nano silver we could get
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.920]  and super strong I don't recommend daily use of it myself personally check with

[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:30.080]  and people say if Aventura is on his own TV show you know saying this stuff look
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.440]  I get it he's a good he is a real libertarian folks he just says total
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:39.760]  freedom but you can't do that when you border a collapsing authoritarian string
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:47.200]  of kleptocracies but it makes me admire just even more that he's so real I
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.000]  mean he really believes in freedom he just like other libertarians I know he
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.240]  just doesn't get it by the way we have an iconic libertarian a lot of his books
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.200]  have been turned into films Ron Paul is in his new film and of course Kevin
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:08.960]  Sorbo Hercules was on a few weeks ago with us he's in it as well and I'm very
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.800]  excited to have him on he's the author of ten books including three novels he's
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.760]  the writer producer director of the new pro libertarian near future suspense
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:23.120]  filler thriller film alongside night which he adapted from his 1979 novel of
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.000]  the same name that really mirrors what we're starting to see happen the novel
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.360]  was endorsed by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman a clockwork orange author
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.240]  Anthony Burgess and Dr. Ron Paul as well as having received rave reviews in
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.400]  magazines and newspapers including Reason and the Los Angeles Times book review
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.000]  alongside night movie calm again I have no stake in the film I'll probably sell
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.680]  it when it comes out on DVD along with God is not dead other great films that
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.720]  are really successful now the reason I promote these is because it's like I had
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.760]  you know I had no stake in America but they're trying to put him in prison for
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:03.160]  making it that's the Susan so I have a stake in the first amendment period they
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.400]  were trying to lock somebody up for a film that I disagreed with I would
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.040]  probably have them on but I will you really think this book is excellent
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.960]  finally got a chance to read it and finish it can't wait to see the film
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.840]  they've sent me a raw copy of it but I haven't had a chance to sit down and
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.640]  watch it yet I will probably not her tomorrow Neil thank you so much for
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.800]  coming on and I'm sorry really I rescheduled you a few weeks ago well I
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.920]  understand Alex breaking news has to take precedence it is such a pleasure to
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.520]  be on with you I am one of your subscribers well thank you brother well
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.040]  it's great to have you here tell folks that don't know about the book why it
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.720]  resonates with folks like Ron Paul and the author of Clockwork Orange and
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:45.520]  others that have been warning of dystopias well Alex not to put to find
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:51.000]  a point on it and and proudly to express the egoism that I'm Rand would approve
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.280]  us but when it comes to portraying the collapse of the United States due to
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.800]  statism there's basically two stories there's Atlas shrugged and there's a
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.800]  long-side night now I had an advantage that I ran didn't have she wasn't able
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.200]  to read along she wasn't able to read alongside night before she wrote Atlas
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.880]  shrugged but I was able to read Atlas shrugged before I wrote alongside
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:18.560]  night people that read the book are blown away by many of the parallels that
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.840]  have come true break down the the you know basic plot of the book for folks
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:27.400]  without giving away too much I took historical examples such as Weimar
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:33.640]  Germany in 1923 before which created the seeds after World War one for German
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:38.360]  dissatisfaction and oppression which led to add adults Hitler having the the
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.280]  opportunity to take over I used historical presidents like that and like
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.880]  Sinclair Lewis did in it can't happen here I applied it to the near future
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.720]  United States and what I came up with was a United States collapsing from
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:58.800]  government over overspending spending us into oblivion the Federal Reserve because
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.920]  the there's no point on art laughter's curve for taxes to be able to support the
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.520]  government anymore so the debt is monetized by the Federal Reserve debt
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:15.080]  is transferred to overseas borrowers because they use the the dollar as their
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:20.240]  reserve currency and essentially what happens is it reaches a crisis point
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.960]  where the government doesn't have the ability to pay the army anymore in the
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:30.400]  meanwhile I have a character Dr. Martin Vreeland the character played by Kevin
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.760]  Sorbo who has convinced the European Common Market Treaty Organization
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.360]  remember in the novel I wrote this before there was a European Union or a
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.000]  Europe he convinces them to go on a gold back Euro Frank and a free market
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.440]  economy so while the United States is in collapse Europe is in recovery and he
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.320]  is the key player as to whether or not he is appointed Treasury Secretary so the
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.480]  European finance ministers will lend enough gold to the United States to
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:05.320]  float a new hard currency to be able to pay the army again however the
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:09.200]  director in the novel of the FBI and updated in the movie to the director of
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:16.000]  FEMA have their own agenda and so Dr. Vreeland and his family including his
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.120]  son 16 year old son Elliot basically find themselves on the run from the
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.760]  federal government as they attempt to to get out of the country before an arrest
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:34.240]  warrant can put them in a secret FEMA prison and now under NDA Eric Holder the
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:39.800]  master kingpin of so many public criminal operations says that Homeland
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:45.480]  Security is not for radical Islam but it is for the Tea Party gun owners
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.440]  libertarians conservatives why do you think we're seeing this shift publicly
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:56.200]  it's so surreal I can't even believe it but publicly on to anybody that likes
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:02.480]  towards Washington as a terrorist well for the same reason why the original
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.320]  tyrant of this continent King George III was not particularly fond of the
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.320]  Continental Congress if you stand up for for your rights then you are not
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:17.000]  their pawns anymore and and your problem Wow I want to talk more about the film
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.680]  but afterwards I want to get your view just on the world today again we have
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.960]  Neil Shulman alongside night movie calm but first off tell folks where and when
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.160]  it's opening how we can make sure that it's a big hit at first for the folks
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.960]  that don't know if the first cities where it's shown sell out for even a few
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.240]  days in a row it will then get booked at other theaters causing a chain reaction
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:45.640]  well Alex it is possible for anybody including Alex Jones to go to the tug
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:49.880]  dot com and I'll use the radio code to spell that that's tango uniform golf
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:55.640]  golf tug dot com and book a screening of alongside night anywhere in the United
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.560]  States there are thousands of theaters which are already signed up into the
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:03.640]  tug dot com system ready to put put this movie out there and so if you don't
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:07.920]  find a screening already in your own city you book one but you do have to do a
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.920]  little bit of marketing because you have to hit a minimum of somewhere between
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:15.800]  60 and 70 or so tickets sold for the screening to be confirmed however if
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:20.120]  it's not confirmed nobody gets charged including the promoter the promoter gets
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:26.720]  5% of the ticket sales and and it's essentially on-demand distribution from
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.000]  the grassroots which is an ideal situation for an independent film like
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.880]  alongside night which although it's being given a lot of attention Kevin
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.880]  Sorbo was just on ABC's on the red carpet over the weekend so we are breaking
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.720]  through to the mass market entertainment media but nonetheless Hollywood
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.640]  hasn't given us a distribution deal yet and this is an ideal way to organize
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.320]  grassroots distribution while we're waiting for a traditional run like
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:55.800]  Kevin Sorbo's previous film God's Not Dead which in nine weeks did 61 million
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.360]  dollars at the domestic box office and then people say well why do I want to
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.480]  make you know the independent filmmaker 61 million dollars because then they
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.400]  can make hit after hit promoting pro-freedom pro-human messages and
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:13.800]  we can literally overthrow Hollywood and the main globalist propaganda arm
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:19.240]  this is how you win wars 90% of it is propaganda and folks propaganda is a
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.240]  neutral term and it has a negative connotation but there's black
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:26.920]  propaganda great propaganda and white propaganda we put out white propaganda
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.440]  families are good private property is good self-defense is good it's a win
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.240]  win win you feel good at night you have a great society you don't screw people
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:39.960]  over black propaganda is lying to people destroying them dumbing them down
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:45.080]  making them dependent MSNBC being deceptive manipulating cheating people
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:49.960]  making them think as groups not individuals great propaganda is just
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.920]  basically taking care of yourself and other people's expenses your take on that
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.520]  I think the age of the kleptocrat is coming to an end I believe that the
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:02.480]  waxing of corruption right now will be the beginning of their undoing look at
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:08.760]  all the statistics Alex you know you do a job as a as an investigative
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.960]  journalist which absolutely has to be done I'm taking a slightly different
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:17.360]  approach I'm saying I think that the system is already beyond the tipping
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:23.360]  point and I think that we are already into a rebirth of the 1776 scenario of
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.360]  directly defending our rights against the government however I am not
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.920]  advocating violence I am not advocating combating the government I'm
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:36.360]  advocating using a jiu jitsu approach of having their force miss us and being
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.920]  able to create a network of secure markets and secure network no no I
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.200]  agree I agree the the the kleptocratic left wants to have a civil war with the
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:50.600]  police and military we just be info war with our dollars and our words befriend
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:55.440]  them and when they still attack us just try to step out of the way as almost like

[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:44.200]  all Smokey's got his ears on he's hot on your trail and he ain't gonna rest till
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:54.480]  you're in jail so you got to dodging you got to ducking going back to Neil
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:00.960]  Shulman very interesting fella alongside night movie comm and again I've heard
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.560]  about this group I think it started in Austin a few years ago it's become very
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:08.680]  popular it's really propelling a lot of independent films to huge success a lot
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:12.360]  of Liberty based films where you go shine up that you do want to see it a
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:18.080]  theater in your area who's associated with it and then if enough people do
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.640]  that it comes and is shown there and I think you've only got to usually get
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:26.840]  about a quarter of the theater filled and then that will pay to bring it to the
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:32.320]  theater very very exciting Neil tell folks again how they can go to that
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.680]  website and sign up to see alongside night movie comm and then if it doesn't
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.560]  show their money's refunded right well first of all it doesn't cost a promoter
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.200]  any money to begin with you don't have to put up any of your own money but very
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:48.840]  frankly if you go to alongside night movie comm I'll write on our website we
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.080]  either have you click through to find theaters or host a screening and that'll
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.480]  put you right on the tug comm website either to buy a ticket for an existing
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.320]  screening or to host a screening of your own listen let me emphasize alongside
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.520]  night is not a documentary like Dinesh D'Souza is putting out no offense to
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.600]  Dinesh D'Souza he is the opposite number of Michael Moore but what alongside night
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.200]  movie is is a near future political thriller and we're talking about a
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.400]  movie with a lot of drama a lot of action a lot of comedy and great music
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:22.680]  including a full symphony orchestra score recorded by the National Symphony
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:26.520]  Orchestra of Ukraine and a theme song which you might might as well figure
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.560]  that is coming out of a James Bond movie which I'm very proud to say was
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:35.120]  written and performed by my daughter Soleil amazing well again it's a key part
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.800]  of the info war that these independent films get promoted out there looking at
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:43.800]  the larger picture I mean I agree with you we're going into the endgame with
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.920]  these people because they're order out of chaos they're more than happy to just
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:52.680]  wreck everything they've already done it Alex you know there was we don't need
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:56.920]  to we look when the alongside night first came out in 1979 it was considered
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:00.760]  science fiction it's not science fiction anymore because the conditions
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:05.320]  necessary for them to have totally violated the rights of the American
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:09.040]  people and for us to realize that the Constitution which was so carefully
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:16.240]  crafted to limit power has not done that I it's a tragedy that that what our
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.960]  founding fathers crafted together and to balance off the powers of government
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.640]  so the people would always be in charge over the centuries it is it is degraded
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:30.320]  to the point where that isn't true anymore we have our rights as stated
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:35.300]  eloquently in the Declaration of Independence and we never give up those
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:40.040]  rights it is not subject to the whim of the government it is not subject to the
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:45.280]  whim of anybody we stand up for those rights we simply say no we will not be
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:51.760]  oppressed we are Americans and we remember and we will never forget we
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.280]  got a couple minutes left before we go to break and I look forward to getting
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:58.960]  you back on the nightly news soon to break down more of the film but other
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:02.320]  points you'd like to address dealing with the film or just where our culture
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:07.800]  in society is going very very frankly we have already reached the tipping point
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.840]  where the government where the government and the powers that wish to
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:16.760]  oppress us have already taken on too much that more than they can shoot okay
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.440]  there is no point on the Laffer curve where taxation can support the
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.840]  government debt it can't even service the debt okay we are going to reach a
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:30.200]  point where the dollar is no longer going to be the reserve currency of
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:33.640]  other countries and they're not going to eat our debt anymore when that happens
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:36.680]  there's not going to be any money for welfare anymore you can talk about
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.080]  whether or not welfare is going to be used for for United States citizens or
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.720]  for foreigners it doesn't matter when the checks bounce and so what we need to do
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.560]  is we need to focus on a post political situation a situation in where the
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:54.520]  solutions come from the economic sector not the political sector resilient
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:58.760]  markets secure communication secure a secure transportation of goods and
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:03.600]  services in such a way that they can't stop our trade anymore we build up
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.760]  secure markets we build up our our our our secure communications in such a way
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.440]  that we exercise our freedom and simply refuse to knuckle down you know what
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.880]  can you do five more minutes with us on the other side because I want to talk
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:20.480]  about what you just said it's so key everything the globalists do the
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.640]  global collectivist who exempt themselves from their own collectivism they
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.600]  live above it but skim off the top use collectivism to dumb us down and
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:32.840]  domesticate us everything they do is about making us dependent making us not
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:37.840]  have our own systems the great crime is to be Amish or to have a lemonade stand
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:42.320]  the great crime is to have your own machine shop that's where they send the
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:47.600]  zoners and the bureaucrats to shut you down you're absolutely right we must

[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:20.360]  their servitude people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:24.720]  decent standard they ought not to know. That's all this hoxley by the way.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:30.040]  Well we did. We're being bred like cattle.
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:45.040]  Too many kids are what's making planet worse a lot of these kids come from bad
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:50.680]  gene pools they don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:55.560]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:59.560]  the journal pediatric these new studies suggest that the opposite that the
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:03.240]  preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:07.360]  performance. Mercury's good kids. Water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could it
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.600]  also cause cancer. Yeah the government had the right under US law to conduct
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:16.600]  secret testing on the American public under specific conditions. We have to work
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:21.880]  with dark side while we spend time in the shadows. Any attempt to achieve world
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:26.960]  order must be the work of the devil. Well join me and I'm glad to sit here at the
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:34.320]  White Hand to say there's a need for a new world order. Someday in the next few
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:39.840]  years a solution will emerge.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.080]  That's Henry Kissinger by the way.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:55.920]  If I say that the glottal is for tyrants I'm a conspiracy theorist. If I say
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.160]  mercury attacks your brain cells like no other heavy metal I'm a conspiracy
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.860]  theorist. If I say Harvard in its own study of 24 other studies says that
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:09.560]  fluoride in the water reduces your IQ by at least 10 points sevenfold increase in
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.680]  bone cancer I'm a conspiracy theorist. It doesn't matter those are all absolute
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.320]  facts. It doesn't matter if two Americans have now gotten Ebola in Africa and it's
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.480]  one plane ride away the CDC says huge Ebola outbreaks all over Western Africa
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:28.640]  it's just no big deal. I'm a conspiracy theorist. If I say our government
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:32.960]  publicly funded ISIS and al-Qaeda to turn them loose worldwide doesn't matter
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.200]  if it's a fact I'm a conspiracy theorist. If I say that DrugsReport.com on the
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.680]  right hand side is linked to that article that Adon Salazar just published
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:48.840]  20 minutes ago and that is that the illegals are to be given preferential
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:56.520]  treatment during hurricanes for evacuation out of the country. A professor
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:02.200]  has come out and said that guest worker program is freezing Americans out of the
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:08.400]  middle class that's USA Today death train to increase traveling speeds to
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.040]  deter jumping on board in the event of emergency illegals to be evacuated
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.720]  before citizens and we reported on this a while back now it's at mainstream
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:26.680]  news border patrol points loaded gun at Iowa Boy Scouts troop on the northern
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:36.560]  border. Plan is to get unaccompanied women and children to safer ground. End of
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:45.480]  Christianity Bishop Warren's ISIS could wipe out Christians the Middle East drive
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:50.240]  the Nazarenes into the desert well that's the plan ladies and gentlemen I
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:53.120]  want to take your phone calls after we finish up with our guests here in a
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:57.720]  moment the toll-free number to join us to discuss all of this design chaos is
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:10.100]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 again 800-259-9231 on this live Monday
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:16.320]  edition but I wanted to ask our guest who's on with us Neil Showman best-selling
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:20.600]  author researcher alongside night movie calm that Ron Paul and Kevin Sorbo and
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:25.280]  others are in that you can help make a success I wanted to ask him though I mean
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:30.680]  he hits on building our own economic systems becoming self-sufficient as the
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:34.880]  collapse comes into view Ron Paul talked about blaming the globalist for the
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.320]  collapse so they don't blame what's left of real capitalism for crony
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:44.640]  capitalism when that goes down I think that's key as well but also reaching out
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.840]  to people in the system so they understand the big picture exposing the
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.840]  globalist is wanting to ride this collapse that they helped engineer but
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:59.840]  also becoming somewhat self-sufficient or even thinking about being self-sufficient
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:05.560]  will then move us in the right direction I totally agree with you because you can
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:11.740]  see the system as I said before went to break they do everything they can to make
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:18.600]  us dependent and to make us basically be like domesticated jellyfish why do you
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.960]  think that is Neil I mean I agree with you obviously that's their weak point
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.280]  they're worried about libertarians and patriots who understand what freedom is
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:33.160]  about just like cancer worries about being cut out of the body by the scalpel
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.280]  if it had a consciousness and they're worried about self-sufficiency so I
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.440]  think if you look at how they're arrayed to stop us you see the answer to defeat
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:48.040]  them right there look in Star Wars what leads to the destruction of the Empire
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:53.120]  it's their hubris is their belief that the Death Star is actually more powerful
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:39:00.560]  than the the Rebel Alliance okay we have the tradition of freedom they are
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.600]  counting from centuries of public education from control of the mass
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:09.280]  media from from control of the culture they think that they can make us
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:15.240]  forget who we are they can't we won't forget we will never forget I also need
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:19.360]  to point out something else Alex you're always trying to unearth secrets you're
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.160]  looking for the whistleblowers you're trying to find out what the enemy is
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:28.040]  doing in secret that's great work but what they do out in the open what they
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:33.800]  brag are that what they consider their triumphs is perfectly sufficient for us
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:38.720]  to recognize them for what they are we don't need to look the curtain to know
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:47.120]  that the that there is no wizard there very profound no no I agree with you and
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:51.360]  so much of what is out in the open because you're informed is not out in the
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.480]  open to the public still maybe 30% of the public in polls thinks hydrofluorosalic
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:59.960]  acid is good for them and then I say to them well then why are they forcibly
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:04.160]  putting it in why don't you just take it forced medication is against the law
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:08.080]  federally at the state level and under the Geneva Convention and they just
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:13.360]  laugh at me and just move on with their ignorance so so I don't even so much
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:18.280]  cover what's secret I do some of that but what is public but but hidden in
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:25.240]  plain view that's exactly right but we need to just remember who we are we need
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:29.040]  to remember what our basic principles are and if we act according to the
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:35.040]  principles that that we were founded on as a nation as a country not as a state
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:40.080]  not even as a federation of states because that's that's a political
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:45.320]  construction which is a temporary device to try to to try to restrain them sure
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.000]  sure it's the culture of America the ideals that were never truly realized
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.920]  that threaten the dragons of the New World Order it's not that the state of
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:58.000]  America was ever that good or special it's just compared to the other slag
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.960]  heaps it was a little bit better so prosperity had a better chance here and
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.520]  became a model of the world but in the parasites flocked here like locust to a
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.520]  cornfield because that's where prosperity had been created now we've
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:14.560]  entered into this decadent a trough a bottom trough hopefully hopefully it's
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:21.520]  the end of this deepening decadence so I get what you're saying but the
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.840]  construct of our republic is certainly better than the North American Union or
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.160]  the United Nations so many libertarians are just ready-to-let it all collapse my
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:37.680]  issue is we are collapsing into a greater form of evil government what do you
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:43.080]  say to that I say that that has been an ongoing process for a long time and
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:48.640]  that's why we need to focus we need to focus on solutions okay we need we need
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.360]  to be solution oriented your solution or oriented in a lot of ways with a lot
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.720]  of your products that you talk about okay we need to be solution oriented in
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:04.720]  terms of power in terms of communication in terms of transportation we need to
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:08.880]  basic look I said it before as a joke but it's it's partially true if the
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.480]  Declaration of Independence were today would read like a 12-step program as we
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:16.960]  wean ourselves away from government but the point is we are reaching a crisis
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.840]  point where the system is going to collapse upon itself we don't need to
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:25.040]  seek out a revolution they are bringing on a revolution and it's simply a matter
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:28.840]  of when I agree I agree who is going to have a chair less who is going to have a
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:33.520]  chair left and I say it needs to be we liberties seekers are not eliminated by
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.600]  them but they think the collapse is going to bring in their volholic
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:43.840]  utopian socialist technocratic construct there's no way it's going to work it's
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:48.760]  going to be an unbelievable unmitigated disaster I mean do you think they have a
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:54.120]  method of their madness at the technocratic level it's again going
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:57.280]  back to Star Wars the more they tighten their grip the more the system will
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:02.880]  slip through their fingers okay the the balance to every controlled economy is
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:07.240]  a counter economy we are the counter economy we will build the economy so
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.920]  that it becomes the economy and we do that by making our business resilient
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:19.440]  and immune to their attacks what is your gut tell you Neil what is your gut
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.120]  tell you how is this going to end I think it's going to end in triumph because
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:28.520]  we have history on our side we have economics on our side their economics
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:33.000]  is based on a lie that you can create something out of nothing our economics
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  is based on a truth that that the people who produce things are are the the
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:47.160]  crucial let the crucial base to to do our security and our freedom they think
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.520]  that we will be fooled that we will accept them as our paternalistic nanny
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:55.120]  state that's a bit of a contradiction but I think it covers both ends of it
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:00.040]  we're not going to that's not that's not the base of principles that that our
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.560]  freedom was founded on that our prosperity was founded on we simply need
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:13.000]  to remember who we are and say no you are not my master well I agree with that
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:18.440]  statement and we have to just respond to the mind control by pointing out what
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.880]  an unmitigated fraud it is again the movie is alongside night movie calm folks
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:27.600]  can find out the tales there Neil Shulman thank you so much for the time it has
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:31.880]  been a pleasure and a pleasure having you I want to go to your phone calls now
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:37.720]  ladies and gentlemen and then I'll get into the other news on the Middle East
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:43.640]  North Korea threatening to nuke the White House that's just more fear mongering
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:50.720]  by another mentally ill statist Kim Jong-un I will also get into mass
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:58.440]  incarceration 21 amazing facts about America's obsession with prison there's
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:03.920]  a lot of other news I haven't gotten to yet multiple reports Ukrainian fighter
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.960]  jets were with Malaysian flight 17 when it was shot down that's now being
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:14.120]  confirmed I just can't believe how brazen the globalist are but I guess I
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:20.280]  guess I I can and I do before we go to your phone calls I wanted to play part
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:28.280]  of the newscast from KRGV news and just point out our veterans are having
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:33.600]  health care taken away confirmed to give it to the illegal aliens so
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:37.560]  understand in this system they want to swamp it and collapse it to bring in
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:41.240]  total control all of you out there that want your government handouts and want
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.480]  people to vote for more government handouts so you're for the illegals
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:48.560]  you're going to end up getting neither because you went along with this and
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:53.400]  again I'm not demonizing the poor people of Latin America who live in living
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:58.520]  hell in general but a lot of them are ms-13 and other gangs that's come out in
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:05.280]  the news and I saw police driving home from East Texas yesterday pulling over
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:11.160]  Hispanic white in black for some reason housewives with their kids and a
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:16.200]  couple times I was in Bell me driving into Waco I saw a guy on a big black
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:22.400]  SUV with a well-dressed church lady look like with with like a five-year-old
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:27.360]  with like a three-year-old standing out in the 110 degree heat while he was
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.120]  searching their vehicle and just the image of that paramilitary officer and
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:38.360]  and this woman and her kids being searched I almost pulled over and started
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:41.600]  videotaping knowing he'd run over and say you can't videotape and I could say
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:46.640]  how dare you be a police state thug but but I wanted to throw up while the
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:52.400]  border is wide open the TSA is on record in articles again this week video just
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:58.400]  waving illegals through no ID and I've seen it before the illegals you know
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:04.800]  well obviously illegals got the cowboy hats whole nine yards cowboy boots whole
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:09.560]  nine yards and they say don't speak English you have no paperwork they sit
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:13.880]  there in Spanish and then they just wave them through the whole police state is
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:20.000]  for us the milk cows we're the target of all of this and it's total
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.560]  discrimination they just want new people to get in here to overthrow the
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:30.480]  political system and if America is so pathetic and so domesticated and we
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.800]  don't stand up to this we get what we deserve and down the road I will just
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:39.120]  leave the country which will only put off the inevitable collapse of wherever I
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:44.080]  go next because there's not many places to go picture countries like islands
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:51.440]  above seas of oppression poverty and tyranny and as the ocean rises even
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:54.640]  though they may sound a conspiracy theorist the islands are actually the
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:58.040]  tips of mountains they're not floating like the congressman from Georgia says
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:00.880]  now he would just call me a conspiracy theorist and say they are floating
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.720]  they're not I know that's a conspiracy for me to have my own view grounded in
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:09.000]  science and to make my own decision if MSNBC doesn't say it's the tip of a
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.880]  mountain that the Hawaiian chain is mountaintops above the Pacific Ocean it
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.920]  isn't that they're floating according to Democratic Congressmen and others but
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:21.800]  I'm gonna be a conspiracy theorist and tell you their mountain tips and as the
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.840]  ocean goes up more countries go under water and the United States has rising
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:33.720]  water there's Switzerland there's New Zealand there's Chile there's places
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:38.000]  like Luxembourg or Monte Carlo of your filthy rich and those places will be
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.880]  safe to the very end places like Monte Carlo places like Luxembourg but folks
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.320]  if you don't have 50 million dollars you can't retire to Luxembourg I've looked
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:50.080]  it up if you don't have four or five million dollars you can't try to even
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:56.000]  get into Switzerland there are a few dozen countries that are a little bit
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.320]  better off the US but the waters rising is my point so here is that newscast in
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.000]  the event of emergency illegals to be evacuated before citizens the
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:11.280]  headlines up on m4wars.com and it was hidden in a KRGV newscast that we've
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.560]  highlighted it's also on drudgerport.com here it is when a hurricane strikes
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:20.320]  getting folks to safety is very important emergency managers and
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:23.280]  McCallan are concerned that with the number of illegal crossers in the
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:29.760]  valley that task just got harder how will they move up to 4,000 unaccompanied
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:34.440]  women and children to safety the questions don't stop there you have
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:39.520]  extra sheltering areas right now detention centers and are they able to
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:43.760]  withstand the wind are they able to withstand floodwaters nearby to get
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.920]  humanitarian relief in there all these questions come with the
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.920]  responsibility of keeping these illegal crossers safe in the event of
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:55.200]  hurricane hits city officials along with multiple emergency managers valley
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.800]  wide came together to analyze the numbers the valley's population exceeds
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:05.200]  1.3 million people according to the u.s. Census Bureau add to that another
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:10.360]  4,000 people here illegally a meeting this week in McCallan set a plan in
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:16.320]  motion the entire valley detention areas will be evacuated first in other
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:21.240]  words before the public gets their mandatory evacuations the plan is to
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:24.760]  get all these unaccompanied women and children out of the valley to safer
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:29.360]  ground ensuring the illegal crossers don't go astray preventing losing
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.080]  track of them during hectic times where they will be evacuated was kept
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:39.040]  private protesters threatening the state let's just stop right there they use
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:42.640]  this to bring a crisis in the border regions federalize the states create

[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:09.800]  2006 back I just want to say that I get really irritated when I try to talk to
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:13.200]  family members and friends and I try to bring up these important topics and they
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:17.600]  just totally go to that your tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist and I'll be like
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:21.520]  well you know this happened you know US US Liberty got attacked you know a long
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:25.200]  time ago I'll try to bring up specific points and stuff about that the globalist
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:28.080]  are trying to do and they just all that didn't happen or they wouldn't even look
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:31.880]  at well what they're really saying is I feel like I don't have any power so I'm
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:36.080]  just gonna deny things and this is my cop out to just go through life and not
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:40.520]  really exist and just be programmed by the false culture they have no culture
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:44.680]  so they're victims you can't be angry at them there are ways to deprogram them go
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:49.280]  ahead no I don't get angry I just get really frustrating and frustrated and
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:53.040]  it gets to me sometimes I just I get I don't know what I can do but I am gonna
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:56.040]  say I just started my own domain name I want to start making my own videos and
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.120]  my big thing is the fluoride in the water and you know the fact that the sun
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:03.240]  plays with our weather patterns and everybody likes to blame global warming
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:06.320]  and Al Gore's not a fear monger he wants to take our money but oh my god
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:11.480]  well you've taken your step into a giant world Matthew and don't thank me

[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:25.560]  family instead of putting your family down so they feel powerful when they
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:30.160]  reject you powerful when they laugh at you so go off be successful on your own
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:34.600]  warning others and then they'll respect you down the road and they'll remember

[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:29.160]  so you're in Georgia former Georgia Peach territory yes sir yeah I just had
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:32.600]  a couple things you know encouraging and discouraging I'll have to say the
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:37.080]  discouraging thing would be you talking about leaving the nation I know that it's
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:42.200]  getting so crazy here that you feel for your family and and I just you know
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:47.120]  probably see too many ways out but the most encouraging thing I see is whatever
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:51.520]  you put a bullhorn in your hand and you go screaming and ranting and telling
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.280]  people what it is and you're gonna have a following I mean you want to be
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:57.840]  William Wallace there you go they're gonna come you build it they will come
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:01.560]  and I will come from all the way from Georgia to help you and your family
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:06.400]  support the border I mean you know securing it and I mean we're up against
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:09.760]  a tyrannical government there's why they've got Rick Perry playing the part
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:13.240]  of I'll put a thousand troops on the border and then you read the fine print
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:17.680]  to deliver them to ice to ship them into the country and then even listeners go
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:22.640]  but I want to believe in Perry I'm sorry it's a fraud it's a hoax I'm not gonna
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:28.320]  lie to people and you got just to be sure it's talking about supporting open
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:31.840]  borders while he lives in Mexico I mean it's just a hoax the left-wing left
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:36.520]  left-wing the right-wing it's all a joke I mean I want to be clear Jesse is a
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:42.320]  total libertarian he says total guns he says legalize everything we shouldn't
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:47.880]  have borders but but you can't have socialism and welfare I mean you wouldn't
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:51.280]  have all these people coming up here if there wasn't welfare or the ones that
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:56.200]  came up with want to work we allow the whole world if you're a criminal you
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:00.880]  run to America now and get signed up with an acorn group and the Democrats
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:05.720]  put the word in it ice and you have a get out of jail free card I mean this is
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:11.360]  a criminal takeover is what it is that's right I just I just wish I know it's
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.960]  it's a it's a really tough thing to the take in of being the actual William
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:20.000]  boss I know we are in the info war but you know to actually be out there you
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.800]  know physically you know it's just that that to me is the most encouraging thing
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:30.360]  that I can think of that you could possibly do well now MSNBC shows
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:37.840]  videos of 1957 with the Republican president Eisenhower sitting the National
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:44.400]  Guard in to block the governor who wouldn't let black kids go to school and
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:48.800]  she has the nerve to say that's the Republicans trying to control the
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:53.000]  border the Republicans the leadership Boehner and all the rest of them are
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.080]  the ones that wrote the original amnesty bill that Obama's trying to pass the
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:01.360]  Republican leadership wants this so they give the right cover oh we put some
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:06.400]  National Guard down there to act as like UPS workers to ship the illegals in on a
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:10.840]  conveyor belt I mean that's how they destroy us is the Republicans play the
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:15.680]  part of the opposition she outrageously calls them racist because they're
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:19.280]  there helping ship the illegals in knowing her viewers are literally the
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:23.880]  dumbest people on the planet I mean how do you defeat such savage deception where
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:29.920]  it's not just it's not just Perry the governor shipping the illegals in it's
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:34.280]  Melissa Harris Perry lying and giving him left cover do you see what I'm saying
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:41.320]  yeah yeah if you got currency backing it all how dare you Perry be trying to
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:46.560]  control the border Melissa Harris Perry says meanwhile he's got National Guard
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:52.080]  down there to deliver the illegals into the country man you got the National
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:56.040]  Chamber of Commerce for it they all want it because they want you poor and

[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:06.200]  Monday edition William Geene of alley pack up there on Capitol Hill will give
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.920]  us the DC breakdown on what's happening with the North American Union
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:15.200]  implosion of our borders and ways to fight back against it or run up the
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:18.760]  white flag and then the level of turning will just intensify Thomas Jefferson
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:22.640]  said the level of turning will live under the exact level you put up with and a
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.640]  lot of other news as well important things are happening like five costume
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:33.760]  characters have been arrested Saturday in Times Square the New York Times says
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:40.440]  when media mergers limit more than competition the censorship of news also
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:45.640]  Hamas chief says we cannot coexist with occupiers and that they do not basically
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:53.200]  want to cease fire you know that's my issue is that it's like a cause celeb
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:11:00.560]  where the only time anybody in the left cares about a war is when it's Israel in
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:05.560]  a war and I'm neutral on the issue and I think it's terrible and both sides have
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:11.520]  major problems I'm on record about that and it's very polarized we were supposed
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:21.120]  to choose one side or the other but I see Al Qaeda ISIS or IS is now known they
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:24.600]  keep changing the name to get away from our government funding them killing
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:30.000]  over 300,000 people conservatively in Syria and now tens of thousands in Iraq
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.680]  blowing up churches every day murdering men women and children mainline
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:41.160]  organizations like the UN admit that Christians may be extincted in Syria and
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:47.880]  Iraq under this they've survived thousands of years 2000 years almost zero
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:53.520]  coverage and you don't hear a word from anybody and then the anti-Israel crowd
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:57.400]  will have like three articles criticizing you know stuff Israel's doing and
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:02.840]  some articles criticizing something that you know Hamas is doing and then
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:09.720]  they'll be Alex is covering up there's no Gaza coverage because intellectually
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:14.400]  that's how you approve you're better oh Alex doesn't cover the North American
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:17.600]  Union Alex doesn't cover the Federal Reserve Alex doesn't cover offshoring
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:24.240]  Alex doesn't cover you know what's happening over in the Middle East Alex
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:29.600]  doesn't I cover it all but there's this fake intellectual thing where people
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:34.880]  just say he doesn't cover the Vatican or he doesn't yeah he works for Israel
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:42.880]  yeah he instead of getting out and fighting the tyranny I mean Egypt just
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:48.440]  destroyed a whole bunch of tunnels out of Gaza into Egypt you got that Gaza
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:53.960]  crew connected into trying to overthrow the Egyptian government what do the
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.080]  Egyptians not let the Gazans in because they hate Arabs or Muslims no folks it's
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:05.440]  because it's a political football and a destabilizing force in the region you
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.760]  could say well that's because Israel took over and do what they did in 1947
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:13.840]  Israel's got 800 nuclear weapons they're not going anywhere so why is it the cause
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:22.000]  of a celeb again to talk about the Israeli-Palestine conflict because that's
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.720]  all you're supposed to know about while all hell's breaking loose everywhere
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:30.080]  else I mean you got over a thousand people killed in Gaza civilian targets
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:33.720]  are being hit because the people firing at the Israelis are in those areas that's
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:37.120]  just a fact of war and I think it's terrible and I think it's wrong and I
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:45.000]  think it's bad but a thousand versus 300,000 can I get 300 times the coverage
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:51.120]  if numbers count no I can't I can't get 1% the coverage of al-Qaeda murdering
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:56.760]  Christians and non-radical Muslims moderate Muslims all over Africa all
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:01.920]  over the Middle East I'm sick of it and you expose that make it a big issue
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:06.960]  that's it for the New World Order folks you know why because then it'll come out
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:16.440]  that there's a criminal group above our government like Specter funding this to
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:23.680]  destabilize the world see I don't like the news what I'm supposed to cover
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:27.760]  being set for me sometimes if something's a big issue and MSNBC says
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:30.920]  the open borders are like the new civil rights movement and that's the big
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:34.320]  national story I'll cover it all the time not because it's a big story they
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:38.920]  made but because their lies are big I'm going to counter it but most the time I
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:43.760]  don't cover what the big fake story is we end up covering what we think is
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:48.400]  important and many times make it an international national story we're here
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:52.600]  to really change the world folks not sit here with a political football of
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:59.640]  Israel versus Palestine and relish hating Israel again I don't like how the
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:04.080]  pro-Israel folks will bully me if I criticize Israel moderately and I don't
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:07.960]  like how the pro-Palestinian people will bully me and lie about me and act like a
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:11.760]  bunch of fools and put out a bunch of this info as well I'm not taking a side
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:18.080]  and I don't like being conscripted into one of the camps it's a tragic tribal
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:22.480]  warfare and I'm sick of it I want to go to lab rat Michelle Bill John Phyllis and
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:27.640]  others let's go to lab rat in New Mexico you're on the air lab rat go ahead
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:33.040]  Alex you are on fire that was maybe the best introduction I have ever heard and
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:37.240]  I've been listening to you for a decade good way to go I want to give a quick
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:43.520]  message today to a victory with regard to Nathan iodine and not just consulting
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:47.200]  but educating the doctors I'd like to give a quick message to the Pharisees
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:51.280]  from a preacher's son and then I'd like to talk about the weaponization of
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:56.120]  social sciences and the desperation of the New World Order to get a handle on
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:59.800]  us because they're failing and all of their attempts have failed can we get
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:04.160]  through those things I go ahead sir Shakespeare said truth is truth to the
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:08.400]  end of reckoning it's in the water it's in the air it's in everything we eat
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:14.200]  drink breathe baritoss is truth to the Pharisees I say we are called to be in
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:19.400]  the world not of the world we are called to be light and salt it's salt loses
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:23.480]  its flavor or savory it's good for nothing Jesus said but to be thrown out
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:28.400]  and trapped underfoot faith without works is dead and let's not forget that
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:34.240]  behind every Melissa Perry whatever her name is is a psychological operations
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:38.480]  division making talking points for the media right now it's in our
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:43.520]  entertainment and it's in our infotainment secondly victory story I
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:48.160]  consulted my doctor about Nathan iodine because I had a miraculous what I call
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:53.720]  miracle experience 10 days uptake and a damaged brain from an injury became
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:58.760]  completely whole again none of my doctors had seen anything like it I consulted
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:03.240]  them about nano silver and about Nathan iodine none of them knew anything about
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:08.320]  it I sent them all the info wars life calm they all immediately googled it
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:13.040]  went through watch the videos one of my doctors is going to start taking super
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:18.160]  female vitality and get back to me at my next appointment so we can educate our
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:23.280]  physician she said to me I am sick of being a bill dispensary for big pharma
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:26.920]  that's all I'm allowed to do I said well that's not all you're allowed to do for
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:33.360]  yourself lastly I was working on something called Claire with a capital
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.960]  AI Claire was eventually going to be what Eric Schmidt wanted and that was a
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:44.200]  computer in every home where you would simply say Claire can you and then it
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:49.120]  would find or do whatever you want it's like Siri it's like Siri it's Siri on
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:54.280]  steroids and when we realized what it was and DARPA had approached us because of
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:59.800]  the semantic web conference address and other things we decided to just stand and
[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:04.840]  move our separate ways and go to different things all of us they lack the
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:07.760]  algorithm Alex why do you think we're doing that
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:14.240]  big ops dot gov looking for game changer private sector investment because they
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:20.000]  are only successful what was it well 4 out of 11 or 4 out of 16 scenarios were
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.440]  successfully predicted and David Knight brought up an interesting thing from a
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:27.920]  caller yesterday maybe they're not trying to predict it maybe they're trying
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:32.480]  to start social unrest I had never occurred they are definitely they're
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:37.880]  definitely starting it but again so they can trigger it so they can lead it and
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:43.320]  control it correct I don't know what the scenario is but I know that they're
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:46.920]  desperate to get their hands around every single piece of human information
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:50.840]  and I quote that can be collected no I agree I want to shift gears back to the
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:55.320]  nice and I specifically what happened when you started taking it was it was it
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:59.280]  X2 or the regular survival shield it was the regular because I'm doing what

[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:29.280]  collapse plan for a long time and quite frankly a lot of people rolled their
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:34.120]  eyes including myself not that I didn't respect you I just didn't understand
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:39.320]  they could be this bold and if they get away with this it'd be like a pervert

[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:47.840]  trouble I mean this is really getting crazy what's happening if you were ever

[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.760]  I want our mission is between today and this weekend and November 4th this could
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:00.480]  become the last ride of the Americans they're going for broke you're right I
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:04.640]  was just doing it there and everybody's face the public is upset and that's why
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:07.440]  the plans that I want to talk about with you in your audience there's some
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:12.400]  hoarding we have to give people a plan to come out of this thing otherwise when
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:15.240]  people are faced with this type of situation they feel powerless they'll
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:19.440]  start shutting down and if Americans shut down on this one it's over we've got
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:23.240]  illegal immigration it's the top issue in America going right into the 2014
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:26.640]  elections and if we do the right things we say the right things and we are
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:30.760]  organized well we can throw more people and DC who are responsible for this
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:35.800]  invasion out of power this year than any prior modern elect I agree with you the
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:39.760]  globalists have really miscalculated out of desperation all the signs all the
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:44.160]  political numbers even mainline pundits say total libertarian tea party sweep of
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:48.960]  Republican blue bloods and Democratic seats and a real reversal so this is
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:54.400]  really a desperation move by the globalist to implode the borders bring in
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:58.240]  the North American Union that's true and if they get much further along without
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:02.080]  us stopping them that's going to be too late and people that come out after this
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:05.200]  election season saying well I want to help or I want to do something we may
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:07.920]  still be fighting back politically but we're gonna have to tell them that it's
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:12.480]  too little too late right now in about five days on Saturday August 2nd we're
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:17.240]  gonna kick off a new wave of national protests against illegal immigration in
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:20.920]  the targeted states of Tennessee Michigan and Washington State of which
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:25.240]  Tennessee is the most important because that's the last place in America where
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:29.440]  we have one more Eric Cantor amnesty supporting type of Republican senator
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:33.000]  Lamar Alexander to try to throw down but for the reasons we can discuss later
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.920]  in the broadcast Alexander must fall Alexander must fall and it's going to
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:42.720]  take a national movement I repeat it is going to take a national movement to
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:48.720]  defeat Lamar Alexander and to elect Joe Carr and the GOP primary that takes
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:53.640]  place Thursday August 7th and we need as many bodies as possible in Tennessee and
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:57.680]  surrounding states traveling to be with us Saturday August 2nd as we protest
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:02.240]  outside of six locations in Tennessee outside of Lamar Alexander's district
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:06.920]  offices to remind the country and all Tennesseans that Lamar Alexander is the
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:11.880]  reason we have a border surge he voted for and passed Senate Bill S44 which
[02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:15.920]  would turn tens of millions of illegals into future voters competitive workers
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:21.920]  and social welfare recipients Lamar Alexander is holding the cards with a
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:26.360]  lot more money than us telling big lies with big media he's got a vote splitter
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:29.360]  on the ballot he's gonna try to get Democrats to come vote for him just like
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:34.520]  we saw down in Mississippi earlier this year but we've got a real groundswell
[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:38.440]  that was is very similar to what happened with Eric Cantor and in fact we
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:41.480]  played a key role in the defeat of Eric Cantor I know you did let's talk about a
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:45.800]  strategy to win and let's look at the enemy strategy here using these
[02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:50.440]  poor immigrants but I think it's gonna backfire we're on the March the

[02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:34.040]  the GCN radio network yeah we're in the danger zone ladies and gentlemen you
[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:37.120]  gotta hand it to the globalist though like all master criminals they are
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:43.960]  incredibly bold they have a lot of panache a lot of flair they are outlandish
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:47.840]  imagine we already have the most open borders in the world the most open
[02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:52.320]  welfare for immigrants in the world it's only Western Europe the United States
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:58.120]  to do this totally wide open if you can get here free healthcare pay for your
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:03.920]  baby massive welfare and see these Latin American immigrants on average have
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:08.720]  been perfect because they are hard working on average and have a lot of
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:13.360]  ingenuity or smart but then they'll also work the system and go get on welfare at
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:18.680]  the same time as a supplemental under multiple identities but forget that now
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:24.240]  this isn't like you know you know like 30 40 years ago having having migrants
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:27.880]  that went back and forth to do the you know hard work out in California we
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:34.680]  didn't have a big farming population this is the collapse of Latin America that
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:38.760]  is in total shambles right now in the global depression in an agreed deal
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:44.360]  with Guatemala Mexico in the US to bring in unlimited illegals who have
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:49.120]  diseases who have huge criminal records who have mental issues who were
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:53.760]  handicapped who are totally ready to fall in as democratic party voters and
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:35:01.040]  then Melissa Harris Perry gets up and says you are racist like the Klan if you
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:07.440]  aren't for totally open borders I mean that is just wild it'd be one thing if
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:11.520]  they said anybody can come here but no welfare that would still be pretty
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:17.360]  wild but I'd be okay fine because you know we've killed 50 something million
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:21.520]  of our babies we didn't replace the population but no no no no if you took
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:24.400]  all the middle class people out of Latin America there's not many down there it
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:29.200]  would collapse that's how the middle class down there is better than our
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:31.400]  middle class because you got to work really hard know what you're doing to
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:37.120]  survive in these kleptocracies if the middle class of Latin America wanted to
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:41.160]  come up here great like I know a lot of rich and middle class Mexicans that have
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:45.720]  fled up here and they'll stop me downtown going Mr. Jones you don't know how
[02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:49.640]  deadly Mexico is I had to leave they used to kidnap people and they took over my
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:53.720]  restaurant they took over my factory or they killed my wife I mean everywhere I
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:57.880]  go I was in a restaurant once and the owner was Mexican from Mexico trying to
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:02.320]  like some famous boxer he runs over like 70 years old like Ricardo Montobon
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:06.000]  he's like Mr. Jones you have no idea how bad it is you're absolutely right it's
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:11.560]  collapsing blah blah blah wait till the average yeppy finds out how bad this is
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:16.960]  I want to go back to William Gean of alley pack.com alipack.com there is a
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:22.960]  strategy like with canner and others to destroy them that's why the because
[02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:26.200]  they're destroying us that's why the Republican leadership with the big
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:30.800]  classic Republican donors have lined up with the Democrats to double down money
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:36.120]  against tea party people at the city county state federal level because they
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:39.640]  can see the numbers that that people understand what's happening and let's
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:43.920]  just be honest here there's probably 20% of the Republican party that doesn't
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:47.760]  like seeing a bunch of brown people run around and and doing it because of
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:53.320]  racism but I know Mr. Gean I know myself this is about survival okay the Latin
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:56.920]  American countries hate each other folks and have riots over soccer games you
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:00.840]  cannot bring in masses of people from collapsed countries like this and not
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:04.400]  have a total meltdown so you got a bunch of racists on the Hispanic side a bunch
[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:09.360]  of racists on the white side this isn't about that I'm not dumb enough to care
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:12.920]  about the color of somebody's skin I care about the content of their minds and
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:17.280]  the Democrats want these people here pure and simple to turn the whole
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:20.760]  country blue and the Republican traders are working with them you've got the
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:24.880]  floor started breaking down William Gean the head of alley pack dot com well
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.160]  what's happening right now Alex we believe is more than just campaigns and
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:31.960]  protests we believe that there's a new movement rising rapidly in America that's
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:36.600]  beyond the men and beyond the tea party and it seems to be involving a lot of
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:40.440]  different groups and and other types of different types of Americans that weren't
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:44.280]  working together before combined with people who are starting to abandon Obama
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:49.040]  and the Democrats including blacks Hispanics white liberals and cities
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:53.200]  everyone's waking up to Obama as he tries to run across the field with this so
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:56.760]  we have a movement this building and we have some very very encouraging
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:01.320]  information of things that just happened you know just last weekend we held over
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:06.760]  300 protests across this country on July 18th and 19th some were small as five
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:10.800]  or ten people on overpass some have hundred people but they were in 300
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:15.600]  locations against illegal immigration against immigration reform and misty
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:20.360]  legislation and against the current Obama inspired border surge that we're
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:24.720]  enduring at our borders right now and we did these and then there was one
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:29.680]  other it was interesting story because it just broke out of Boston we had gotten
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:33.320]  a note from some people in Boston around a radio show personality that wanted to
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:36.720]  do one as part of our national protest but they wanted to do it a week later
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:39.320]  we're like well okay you know we're trying to get everybody to do it same
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:44.480]  time so we did ours we broke through them the mainstream media we generated
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:49.040]  hundreds of local television local newspaper local radio broadcasts that
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:53.800]  were devoid of the usual racism calls and negative type of bias that we
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:57.680]  encounter from the mainstream national media we bypassed them we broke through
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:02.640]  that then a week later this past Saturday July 26th truly historic date
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:10.360]  Boston Massachusetts over 500 American paid 525,000 American patriots gathered
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:14.200]  in Boston following a radio show host and Jeff Cooner who did one of these
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:18.960]  protests but of course the Boston Globe takes little bitty up close pictures of
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:23.360]  the crowd claims that only hundreds were there and as a disinformation campaign
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:27.160]  worthy of a psychological operation conducted by military against another
[02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:31.160]  nation they pumped this out on social media saying look Boston and we were
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:34.520]  excited cuz yeah hey you know a couple hundred people that was great about an
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:37.560]  hour and a half later this past Saturday night the pictures start coming in
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:42.440]  there are clearly thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people in a
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:47.960]  liberal bastion like Boston that are chanting send them back send them back
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:53.360]  in USA so we have a movement here that we have to we have to nurture it we
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:58.120]  have to build it up it starts this Saturday in three states Tennessee
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:02.880]  Washington State and Michigan we have protests that are on the front page at
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:10.480]  alipak.us alipac.us and our email alerts will also keep you up to date we're on
[02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:15.120]  Facebook under Americans for legal immigration but remember the Facebook is
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:19.240]  Mark Zuckerberg and Obama Territory everything you say there is completely
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:22.480]  recorded and monitored and you can't trust them let us get to you when you
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:26.520]  need it when we need to so we start on the second we've got a few more target
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:29.040]  protests but then we're going to have them all over the country in different
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:34.760]  places culminating in a new hopefully larger national way we want at least 500
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:38.400]  protests across the country right before the general elections on Friday
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:44.920]  October 24th and Saturday October 25th we want it to be undeniable we want it
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:48.400]  to be so powerful it doesn't matter what the media does that they see these
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:52.720]  protests all across the nation and Alex I don't mean to put you on the spot but
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:55.800]  there's something I hope you'll consider I hope that you'll ask your staff to
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:58.880]  start putting our updates on your website about this this thing and
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:03.680]  consider leaving and protest yourself because the indication from what happened
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:08.360]  in Boston is that if you or other talk radio show personalities out there
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:12.800]  that are monitoring the situation if you go to the ground now if you reinforce
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:16.240]  one of these local protests if you show up as a speaker and talk about on your
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:20.600]  show instead of a few hundred people we end up with thousands and while some
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:24.320]  radio show host may say well you know I just record and I don't really get too
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:29.440]  involved with the politics of it maybe so this is the maker break point for the
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:33.200]  United States of America this is where the country is teetering between
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:37.200]  destruction and possible salvation that's going to be decided between this
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:42.680]  very day today and November 4th 2014 because we have a chance to throw out
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:48.080]  more you know the goal is to throw Lamar Alexander out on August 7th and after
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:53.600]  that the goal is to wipe out politically every single Democrat running from dog
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:59.000]  catcher up to US Senate weekend the party of Obama has to fall so hard that
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:03.200]  our political revolution must be stronger than the the revolution of 2010
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:07.240]  stronger than the revolution of 94 and I believe that all of the stars are lying
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:11.680]  for us to do that if the proper activist citizen support and leaders will step
[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:15.960]  forward at this time well I'll say this I've always tried to be nonpartisan and
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:19.120]  I've kept Republicans and Democrats at arms length I'm a libertarian
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:22.600]  constitutionalist so I got attacked more by the Democrats traditionally because
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:26.160]  they're basically communist at the grassroots level above them or these
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:29.920]  globalists that you know are managing any any dumbed-down population they can
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:36.840]  control but the Democrats under Obama the last seven years are going for the
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:40.760]  juggler shutting down our coal power plants they're totally clean and they
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:43.480]  even have mainstream articles today about how it's making the earth dirtier
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:47.760]  because Mexico and China and India have no controls and it's all just going
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:52.720]  there energy prices doubling for electricity roughly has made what
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:57.360]  companies were here leave I mean folks I say that every day because shutting
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:01.880]  down our power plants I mean I mean that's an act of war that's an act of
[02:43:01.880 --> 02:43:08.720]  embargoing the nation devaluing our dollar funding al-Qaeda starting wars
[02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:17.240]  with Russia I mean I it's just over the top how long land nuts it is and I
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:20.800]  want to believe that the globalists through Obama at least have some plan
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:24.840]  but when I really pull back from it they're destroying their own empire and
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:30.440]  it really comes down to the fact that the Democratic Party really does hate
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:35.440]  individual wealth in the middle class and I've got an article here where today
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:38.440]  I was gonna get to a minute when I dig it out where all the majority of
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:42.280]  billionaires are supporting open borders because they really do want to
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:45.760]  destroy the middle class and be the only ones with money because the only thing
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:48.800]  that threatens a big globalist is the middle class it's got a million bucks
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:54.280]  or a half million dollars saved because we might want to be free or somebody's
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:57.360]  going to retire with a million dollars or two million dollars they want us out
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:01.240]  of the way just like in the third world they want people poor and it's
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:05.720]  fundamentally that Warren Buffett Bill Gates Zuckerberg with his pump and dump
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:11.520]  it makes me angry at them William that they're they really I realized that
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:16.400]  the Democratic Party is like Ted Bundy psychopaths at the highest levels they
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:22.400]  they didn't used to be this bad in my view so I'm forced to totally throw my
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:27.560]  weight behind the Tea Party and and proto-conservatives because not that
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:31.200]  they're even perfect but because the Democrats are the equivalent of
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:35.680]  metastasized cancer well Alex once again this what's happening now it's beyond
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:38.800]  it's beyond the Tea Party because I think a lot of people are starting to
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:44.560]  understand that what we have here is a constitutional crisis when the borders
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:47.560]  are being destroyed and our existing laws are not being enforced and the
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:52.000]  president of the United States is so far outside of his constitutional abilities
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.400]  including what you mentioned earlier the report that he's going to grant amnesty
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:01.880]  to five million illegal emirates let me make this clear Barack Obama does not
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:08.200]  have the constitutional authority to grant amnesty to any group of people he
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:12.960]  doesn't he does it so how is it happening well he must be stopped now our
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:17.600]  way to stop him is this we feel that if we had a speaker of the House it was
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:21.720]  actually his political opponent instead of John Boehner who is actively
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:25.240]  protecting president they're blackmailing Boehner that's the word but
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:30.920]  whatever his excuse mr. Mr. Pink tie teary eyes excuses I don't care what is
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:34.360]  excuses and anybody out there that doesn't understand what I'm saying yet
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:38.600]  when I say that John Boehner is actively protecting president Obama you need to
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:43.240]  get wise really fast is he hanging out with Lindsey Graham probably more ways
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:47.480]  than we'd like to think about but there's probably what we think would happen
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:52.240]  here is if we had a speaker of the House that was serious about his oath of
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:57.200]  office and his party and his principles we would probably see a lot of Obama's
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:01.320]  abuses of power stop immediately oh exactly the Republican leadership is in
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:04.560]  bed giving him the green light it's important to point out they are the
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:09.120]  real Benedict Arnold's but yes the president would not restrict what does
[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:13.520]  not restrain himself from further abuses of power the forefathers of this
[02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:18.440]  nation they built a clause into the Constitution they put they built the
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:22.520]  remedy in there and the remedy is to impeach the president and piece the
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:25.920]  vice president down to the third in command the speaker of the House and the
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:29.600]  speaker of House make sure it's not some sell it like John Boehner and the
[02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:32.960]  speaker of the House comes out says we can piece the president for numerous
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:37.320]  crimes and abuses of power we are now in control of all federal agencies are
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:40.920]  under the control of the Congress and we'll remain so for one year until we
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:44.800]  make sure all of Littico's are kicked out and that all federal agencies of the
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:49.440]  United States government are back under constitutional and control of the people
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:53.120]  because right now we've got people over the IRS that need to go to jail for
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:56.960]  targeting political that's what I was getting to earlier it is a wild power
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:03.120]  grabbing orgy literally shutting the country's power off which the average
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:06.640]  person doesn't understand your your your power prices doubling screws you over
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:11.000]  shuts down factories it's just it's they literally want to destroy the country
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:15.240]  why would the elite that already runs the nation want to destroy their own
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:21.240]  engine I just they don't want to destroy the whole country they just want to
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:26.440]  destroy the kinds of people of all races that might be motivated by things
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:30.160]  they don't control they like people who motivate or motivated by the same thing
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:35.000]  as the market forces fear and greed and people who are nationalists oriented or
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:40.240]  pay america patriotic americans or christians or other religions and what
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:44.960]  they don't operate on just fear and greed these are people we are people that
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:49.000]  operating on a set of principles and understanding and a relationship between
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:53.440]  ourselves God and our government and a government that was modeled after the
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:56.960]  reform the christian informants of western Europe oh yeah that's it they
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:01.800]  they want totally displaced desperate people that have no idea what's going
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:06.280]  on who can become a total slave political class to be exploited I mean
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:09.000]  let's be clear they're already exploiting these these young people and
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:14.080]  these teenagers and these moms for all sorts of criminal operations man I tell
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:18.280]  you I tell you the democratic party is a mafia but you do that they're they're
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:23.440]  doing that by bringing in people that have no shared national cultural experience
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:27.640]  with us that are willing to literally say or do anything that their new masters
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:32.160]  call on them to do to protect their position once obama brings these these
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:37.080]  kids in gives them their obama phone and rolls them in obama care puts them in a
[02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:42.200]  public school pays for their housing pays for their food and envelops them in
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:46.040]  the moment with democratic party operatives six thousand dollars a month
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:50.200]  so it's like a democratic foster care system I think it goes way beyond
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:54.240]  political democratic political machinery and I would contend that these these
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:57.720]  people will do anything that their leaders call them that to do and I do
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:02.600]  mean anything well they admit that MS-13 these gangs use these kids to kill
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:08.400]  people that's now been confirmed fake ideas political cutouts I mean I've never
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:14.040]  seen anything and then I saw cops on I-35 searching housewives with babies
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:18.480]  yesterday searching their cars but our borders open the problem about trying to
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:22.760]  take up full gun confiscation and cracking down to top and a totalitarian
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:26.760]  fashion against American citizens is who amongst the country hates their fellow
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:30.000]  countrymen and women so much that you could turn to do that they only have a
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.600]  small section of people that are willing to do that and it's probably going to be
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:36.840]  the people that's remained loyal to Obama to the very end these people that
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:40.920]  come in and they come to them and say you must do this for your glorious leader
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:44.200]  or you're going back to the jungle and you got to give the phone back and food
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:48.000]  back and the free lodging back they'll probably a lot of them make the decision
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:52.200]  to do about anything but once again the Constitution that's like the African
[02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:57.280]  child slave slave soldiers well they're not out there they're not currently
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:00.400]  sworn to the United States Constitution they don't seem to have any
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:03.680]  appreciation I mean that's what that's all those African countries are run is
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:07.920]  off poor kids they grab a 12 and give a machine gun to and Obama talks about as
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:12.400]  national security force just as big just as strong as our military it's so bold
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:15.920]  but when you look at it they really are doing that well if we wanted to help
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:19.920]  these people and help their country's idea would be to export the things that
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:23.560]  have been great and work about America to them but instead we're exporting the
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:26.760]  things that are wrong with their countries in two hours and that's
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:30.960]  clearly and it's happening against the will of like the polls you cited 70
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:36.000]  80 90% of Americans of all races all walks of life opposed this and that's
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.280]  why they called you a racist and me a racist because they want to try to put
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:42.600]  divisions in between us to stop you or me or anyone else this is gonna hurt

[03:03:08.160 --> 03:03:12.600]  no that's a great idea just to draw attention to it through each town we

[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:25.160]  moms the kids the criminals you know the it runs the gamut this is about the
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:28.800]  government just opening the border without a law encouraging the flood
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:32.360]  acting like they're not doing it keeping it secret they're busing them in we
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:36.440]  expose that I mean this is about lawlessness they can do anything they
