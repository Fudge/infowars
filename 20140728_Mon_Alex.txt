[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.804]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:11.405]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:12.946]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:17.150]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.253]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:39.329]  How do you get people out of their comfort zone?
[00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.630]  That's really the big question.
[00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.492]  Americans are somewhat awake now to the perils of globalism.
[00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:50.874]  And the average American, the polls show it, don't trust the government.
[00:00:50.874 --> 00:00:57.157]  The average American sees the central government as authoritarian, even totalitarian.
[00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:04.060]  But do they really understand what makes the kleptocrats tick and what their ultimate endgame goal is?
[00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:12.991]  What is that unknown country that history's tyrants are trying to arrive at?
[00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.311]  The truth is that country doesn't exist.
[00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:23.353]  It is the nature of oppressors that they relish in dominating others and controlling others.
[00:01:23.353 --> 00:01:28.254]  And it is the nature of those that tend to dominate to not seek out power and control.
[00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:33.495]  And that is why we are overrun historically time and time again.
[00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:47.302]  We produce, we build civilization, and the parasites then take it over, hollow it out until it finally collapses yet again, and the cycle begins anew.
[00:01:47.302 --> 00:01:50.686]  We have several guests joining us today.
[00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:54.665]  Scheduled a few weeks ago, but he'll be popping in about 20 minutes.
[00:01:54.665 --> 00:02:06.652]  Neil Shulman, alongside Knight Movie, is going to be popping in to talk about his dystopic novel he wrote decades ago that's unfortunately coming true.
[00:02:06.652 --> 00:02:15.017]  Then William Gein of Alipac, who predicted that Obama would basically end the borders by fiat when he was on a few years ago with us.
[00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:19.440]  The head of Alipac will be joining us for about 45 minutes in the third hour.
[00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:29.056]  In the meantime, there's obviously a ton of incredibly important news.
[00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:40.247]  We have two Westerners now that have contracted Ebola, and Ebola is spreading all over Western Africa right now.
[00:02:40.247 --> 00:02:43.631]  It's been going on for several months, but it's becoming crisis level.
[00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:56.312]  As well as tuberculosis, the black plague, or the black death as it's known, is also popping up in the United States.
[00:02:56.312 --> 00:02:59.775]  We're going to be discussing some of those issues today.
[00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:09.223]  We'll look at the latest on what's happening over in Israel and Palestine with the situation with the ceasefire breaking down with Hamas.
[00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:12.966]  North Korea has vowed to nuke the White House.
[00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:15.228]  Maybe we'll send Ambassador Dennis Rodman again.
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.062]  Over there to figure out exactly what's happening.
[00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:29.867]  Also, there's a big fight going on over in the UK about designer genetically modified babies that are already being rolled out.
[00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:36.011]  And of course, we'll look at the big issue front and center, the end of our borders.
[00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:45.356]  By the way, you know, I asked the question, how do you get people when they visit a website or listen to a radio show or at a town hall to pay attention?
[00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:48.687]  Do you put your headlines in red occasionally?
[00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:53.750]  The most sincere form of flattery is imitation.
[00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.974]  So we copy Drudge quite a bit sometimes and have really important articles linked up in red.
[00:03:58.974 --> 00:04:03.217]  People pay more attention to those on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:04.278]  Or do you have a siren?
[00:04:05.236 --> 00:04:10.120]  Drudge only does that a few times a year, where he has a big red and blue police siren up there.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:20.867]  You know, I think Drudge almost should have a siren up there every day right now, with the borders imploding and the attempt to start World War III with Russia, because it's that big a deal.
[00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:27.592]  But obviously, if you had a siren up every single day, it would lose its power.
[00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:29.694]  But this is that time in history where
[00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:39.323]  In a hundred year period, you might have a few dozen sirens, but then during a four or five year period, when big changes happen, the siren's just on continually.
[00:04:39.323 --> 00:04:45.448]  And I think we're approaching a time, societally, where the siren is just gonna be on non-stop.
[00:04:45.448 --> 00:04:52.313]  Where the artillery bombardment of tyranny against humanity is so great, that there aren't any explosions in between.
[00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:54.314]  It's just one big din.
[00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:56.056]  Not a boom boom boom boom boom boom boom, but a...
[00:04:57.799 --> 00:04:59.020]  Continue.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.081]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.223]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:05:04.223 --> 00:05:10.406]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:15.489]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:20.371]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:24.874]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:33.779]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:35.920]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:47.126]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:05:47.126 --> 00:05:54.530]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.
[00:05:55.932 --> 00:06:05.823]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:10.408]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:06:10.408 --> 00:06:14.974]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:06:15.354 --> 00:06:18.276]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:06:18.276 --> 00:06:23.740]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:31.124]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:35.247]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:06:35.247 --> 00:06:40.030]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:48.979]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:53.244]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:06:53.244 --> 00:06:58.469]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:06.392]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:08.753]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:08.753 --> 00:07:14.034]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:18.956]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:22.519]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:26.583]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:30.928]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:41.157]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:41.157 --> 00:07:43.660]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:52.068]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:56.052]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:13.064 --> 00:08:14.204]  Big Brother.
[00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:15.965]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:17.886]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:19.607]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:21.267]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:26.589]  Live, from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:35.152]  It's close to midnight, and something evil's lurking from the door.
[00:08:35.152 --> 00:08:39.334]  Under the moonlight, it seems that I almost stopped your heart.
[00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:51.250]  No, we don't cover imaginary ghosts and goblins and vampires and other scary creatures of midnight here.
[00:08:51.250 --> 00:09:00.618]  We break down the real threat to humanity, our own species, the dominant species that we know of on this planet.
[00:09:00.618 --> 00:09:02.680]  6,000 years of recorded human civilization.
[00:09:03.686 --> 00:09:08.951]  And the number one threat to our species is our own species.
[00:09:08.951 --> 00:09:10.152]  We call it war.
[00:09:10.152 --> 00:09:11.333]  We call it crime.
[00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:13.835]  We call it oppression.
[00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:20.661]  And because the world is so good, and there's so many wonderful things in it, and so much beauty and art and things worth defending...
[00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:47.159]  I am here exposing the corruption, exposing the evil, exposing the threats, so that we can recognize the good from the evil, so we can have a societal and cultural debate about what is good and bad, so that we can recognize it and try to have less corruption, less ugliness, less oppression in our society.
[00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:51.562]  The system, the modern technocrats in the last hundred years, have sold the idea
[00:09:53.047 --> 00:10:02.571]  of being submissive politically and not being armed and not having male role models as a way to end violence and end war.
[00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:10.514]  And the truth is under these models we've actually seen more war and more subtle forms of creeping death and oppression.
[00:10:10.514 --> 00:10:17.537]  Here's the bottom line I want to first talk about today before I get into the giant stacks of vital news and information on this 28th day of July 2014 Monday edition.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.261]  And again, I'm your host, Alex Jones, if you just joined us.
[00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:29.784]  Before I get into all of this, I want to quantify something.
[00:10:29.784 --> 00:10:49.813]  Because you can get lost in all the details, lost in all the political narratives, you can get lost within all the debates of which side are you on, Coke versus Pepsi, Chevy versus Ford, Dodge versus Toyota, Republican versus Democrat, Russia versus the U.S., NATO versus
[00:10:51.158 --> 00:10:53.801]  The list goes on and on.
[00:10:53.801 --> 00:11:12.581]  But when you pull back and look at the technocratic scientific structure behind it, when you look at the international agreements, the trade agreements, the secret agreements, when you look at what is outside of the controlled paradigm, that's when things really start to make sense.
[00:11:14.577 --> 00:11:42.212]  And it's so complex, many books and white papers have been written that I've read, and still countless others that I've not come across, because I'm always running into new ones, where the establishment is constantly writing manuals for their own minions to understand the paradigm of control, because they have trouble getting their own people to understand the scientific dictatorship themselves.
[00:11:43.268 --> 00:11:45.389]  And there are countless books that break this down.
[00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:46.870]  Tragedy and Hope.
[00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:52.353]  The Anglo-American Establishment, both by Carol Quigley.
[00:11:52.353 --> 00:11:55.394]  Zbigniew Brzezinski's books.
[00:11:55.394 --> 00:11:58.976]  Ecoscience, John P. Holdren.
[00:11:58.976 --> 00:12:02.638]  The Council on Foreign Relations bi-monthly publication Foreign Affairs.
[00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:05.600]  It's all there.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.522]  They admit in books written in the 60s and 70s that the U.S.
[00:12:09.522 --> 00:12:12.864]  government runs almost all global narcotics operations.
[00:12:12.864 --> 00:12:17.286]  They admit that major governments run the child kidnapping operations.
[00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:21.348]  They admit that they are ending humanity as we know it.
[00:12:21.348 --> 00:12:24.550]  But they must first collapse the old system to bring in the new.
[00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.711]  It's all very public.
[00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.432]  They admit they're going to take our children.
[00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:31.689]  And that our children belong to the state.
[00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:36.234]  They admit they're putting chemicals in the food and water to make us go into fertility much younger.
[00:12:36.234 --> 00:12:40.197]  And to basically end sexuality by hyper-sexualizing us first.
[00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:41.759]  It's all on record.
[00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:53.331]  I've interviewed the scientists, the medical doctors, the PhDs, the sociologists, the anthropologists, the psychologists, the social engineers, the admin, the corporate people, the billionaires.
[00:12:53.931 --> 00:12:58.232]  The head of the Kissinger group, the congressmen, the senators, the movie stars.
[00:12:58.232 --> 00:13:03.354]  In 20 years of fighting these people, I have interfaced with them.
[00:13:03.354 --> 00:13:07.115]  And what I tell you is not my opinion.
[00:13:07.115 --> 00:13:17.678]  What I tell you is the spectrum of grounded analysis of the world of those that live and those that sleep.
[00:13:17.678 --> 00:13:18.878]  They live, we sleep.
[00:13:20.168 --> 00:13:39.791]  And so if you're watching us on InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv, if you're a news subscriber, or you're watching us on the free feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show, if you're a radio listener, you can go there and you can see that I took my children to a laser blazer tag place this weekend.
[00:13:41.161 --> 00:13:46.463]  And they won a bunch of tickets in the arcade playing foosball and things.
[00:13:46.463 --> 00:13:51.846]  And so one of the prizes for 1,000 tickets was a police siren.
[00:13:51.846 --> 00:13:58.169]  And it made me think of the Drudge Report when my son decided he wanted this for the 1,000 plus tickets he'd won.
[00:13:58.169 --> 00:14:06.853]  And I thought, you know, Drudge puts a siren up a couple times a year to symbolize something huge, something bombshell.
[00:14:09.304 --> 00:14:15.990]  Something absolutely gigantic that he believes will be seismic.
[00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.733]  He red links things that are new on a weekly basis that are important.
[00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:21.195]  We do the same thing.
[00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:24.578]  Again, the greatest form of flattery is imitation.
[00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:41.518]  But how do we culturally and societally get people to see a big siren above their heads or a big light bulb to go off and say, you know, a lot of what this guy talked about years ago has come true.
[00:14:41.518 --> 00:14:52.641]  We might want to actually look into it because if 1% of what he's saying is true or 10% of what he's saying is true, we are in serious trouble.
[00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:59.848]  But if you feel like you don't have any power, you just say, oh, c'est la vie, why does it matter?
[00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:04.051]  What you have to understand is, it is animating.
[00:15:04.051 --> 00:15:09.936]  It is the great contest of life to survive and to thrive and to build and to innovate.
[00:15:09.936 --> 00:15:11.597]  That's the good side of humanity.
[00:15:11.597 --> 00:15:15.119]  The way out weighs the bad side.
[00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:17.121]  But when good men and women
[00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:26.163]  refused to see the sirens, refused to see the red flags, refused to see the writing on the wall.
[00:15:26.163 --> 00:15:31.906]  The entire world slides deeper and deeper towards the abyss.
[00:15:31.906 --> 00:15:38.349]  And in the past, tyrannies would just fall via their totalitarian total oppression.
[00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:39.430]  It's the very nature of them.
[00:15:41.109 --> 00:16:04.848]  But now with the high-tech overlay, the GMO, the genetic engineering, the over-the-horizon predictive systems that are near crystal ball level of the Google slash NSA, Microsoft, Apple interfaces, the elite have been given powers that to the ancients would be considered beyond anything Zeus could even imagine.
[00:16:04.848 --> 00:16:07.751]  They have Promethean fire squared.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.222]  But they are the worst of the worst of our species.
[00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:19.486]  I don't care if they're communist Chinese elite, whether they're German elite, whether they are Mexican elite, whether they are U.S.
[00:16:19.486 --> 00:16:26.870]  elite, whether they are Israeli elite, whether they are Muslim elite, Arab elite, African elite.
[00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.772]  You have two different types of government.
[00:16:29.772 --> 00:16:35.375]  And a couple years ago I first said this to Dinesh D'Souza, and then I said it again to him when he was on a few months ago and I was listening to
[00:16:36.417 --> 00:16:42.600]  To Fox News driving back from dropping my son off at camp in East Texas.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:56.006]  I was driving back to Central Texas last night and I was listening to different news channels on XM and I was listening to Huckabee and he had Dinesh D'Souza on and Dinesh D'Souza said there are two types of government in the world.
[00:16:56.006 --> 00:17:00.288]  When you really boil it down, there are governments of innovation and wealth creation
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.902]  And there are governments of conquest and oppression.
[00:17:03.902 --> 00:17:10.186]  And you can call it conquest, oppression, rule of gangs, whatever you want, that's tyranny.
[00:17:10.186 --> 00:17:18.431]  And then there's government by renaissance, government by innovation, government by wealth creation.
[00:17:18.431 --> 00:17:24.055]  And those were exact quotes of me being uttered by Dinesh D'Souza on Fox News.
[00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:26.437]  And by the way, I didn't get irritated at Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:17:27.932 --> 00:17:35.978]  He may not even know that those are quantified statements that I have coined based on many other people's research as well.
[00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:37.499]  I mean, we're all connected to each other.
[00:17:37.499 --> 00:17:39.000]  We all steal from each other.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.804]  It was a great flattery to hear my words coming out of his mouth as I do all over the place now.
[00:17:45.804 --> 00:17:53.469]  I don't personally even want the credit because it's dangerous to get it.
[00:17:53.469 --> 00:17:55.331]  I just sit back and smile
[00:17:57.905 --> 00:17:59.078]  In the dark alcove.
[00:18:01.835 --> 00:18:11.397]  And look out into the street and see my understanding, which is basic rediscovery of Renaissance liberty understanding.
[00:18:11.397 --> 00:18:28.200]  I mean, I can read writings of the Founding Fathers, I can read writings of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, I can read writings of ancient philosophers, Cicero, who loved liberty, and it's everything I've thought, everything I've believed, because it's true!
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.380]  Two thousand years ago,
[00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:38.552]  25 years ago, 100 years ago, a month ago, it resonates because it is veritas.
[00:18:38.552 --> 00:18:41.013]  It is truth.
[00:18:41.013 --> 00:18:45.115]  And that's why the system wants to suppress human liberty.
[00:18:45.115 --> 00:18:51.537]  And wants to label tyranny as human liberty.
[00:18:51.537 --> 00:18:53.878]  So let us all awaken together.
[00:18:53.878 --> 00:18:59.080]  Not even to the same truths, but to the truths that we share together that resonate in the human breast.
[00:18:59.778 --> 00:19:18.207]  And let's wake up to the fact that we are in headlong dissent right now into the most dangerous period of human development, and then if we don't get serious and force a hardcore debate about the sirens that are going off right now, we're going to lose everything.
[00:19:18.207 --> 00:19:20.948]  And that's an understatement.
[00:19:20.948 --> 00:19:22.369]  We are going to lose our very
[00:19:23.226 --> 00:19:24.587]  Free will?
[00:19:24.587 --> 00:19:32.210]  We are going to be torn apart by this technocracy whose dream is to deface and vandalize the human condition.
[00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.571]  And that's what tyrants do.
[00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:39.653]  But they're going to ride it large with the entire scientific system behind it through compartmentalization.
[00:19:39.653 --> 00:19:44.376]  They have many of our best men and women working towards this goal, not seeing the big picture.
[00:19:44.376 --> 00:19:49.518]  I am here to get people to decompartmentalize and see the big picture for themselves, to take the red pill.
[00:19:50.018 --> 00:19:52.545]  One cannot be told about the Matrix.
[00:19:52.545 --> 00:19:53.508]  One must see it.
[00:19:53.508 --> 00:19:55.954]  The red pill, the red siren.
[00:19:55.954 --> 00:19:57.558]  We'll be right back with the big news.
[00:19:57.558 --> 00:19:57.999]  Stay with us.

[00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.892]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.

[00:21:24.564 --> 00:21:26.825]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[00:21:26.825 --> 00:21:29.726]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[00:21:29.946 --> 00:21:41.636]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.

[00:21:58.564 --> 00:22:04.105]  Question, could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:05.365]  Answer, yes!

[00:22:58.052 --> 00:23:01.073]  Do you ever feel like you live in an alternate universe?
[00:23:01.073 --> 00:23:05.214]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying.
[00:23:05.214 --> 00:23:08.235]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[00:23:08.235 --> 00:23:09.856]  Chaos on our border.
[00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:12.377]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[00:23:12.377 --> 00:23:14.297]  Life is getting ready to change.
[00:23:14.297 --> 00:23:17.339]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.

[00:23:27.882 --> 00:23:29.002]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:29.002 --> 00:23:33.484]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:33.484 --> 00:23:39.205]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:39.205 --> 00:23:41.366]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[00:23:41.366 --> 00:23:42.786]  No word about IRAs.
[00:23:42.786 --> 00:23:45.447]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:45.447 --> 00:23:50.408]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:23:50.408 --> 00:23:50.708]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:50.708 --> 00:23:52.029]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:20.316 --> 00:24:22.197]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:22.197 --> 00:24:22.697]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:22.697 --> 00:24:23.717]  Central.
[00:24:23.717 --> 00:24:26.538]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're here live.
[00:24:26.538 --> 00:24:28.939]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central.
[00:24:28.939 --> 00:24:31.620]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.962]  Dedicated to freedom and human dignity.
[00:24:34.962 --> 00:24:39.003]  Dedicated to taking tyrants and control freaks on.
[00:24:39.003 --> 00:24:41.104]  Head on and running them down.
[00:24:42.133 --> 00:24:45.435]  We are committed, we're going in, and nothing's gonna stop it.
[00:24:45.435 --> 00:24:51.360]  But the good Lord above, and I believe, and know, we have Providence on our side, so keep those prayers coming, folks.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.021]  We're all in this together.
[00:24:53.021 --> 00:25:04.449]  Again, on this Monday edition, I wanna get into all the news, but looking at the big picture, the reason I tell you about the success of InfoWars a few times a week is because our success is your success.
[00:25:04.449 --> 00:25:09.113]  And the success of the new media is a boon to all of us.
[00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:19.995]  We are together, we are brothers and sisters, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, in the fight for human dignity and being honorable.
[00:25:19.995 --> 00:25:26.979]  That's really the only possession that matters in the final equation is that, and of course family, and that's not a possession.
[00:25:26.979 --> 00:25:33.783]  That is part of the continuum of humanity, and we're all a family when you look at it in that context.
[00:25:33.783 --> 00:25:39.366]  And the system uses and manipulates the goodwill of good men and women to guilt us
[00:25:40.529 --> 00:25:44.912]  into going along with what they want us to do.
[00:25:44.912 --> 00:26:06.466]  And once they create a guilt complex in you as a young child, showing Watership Down, the rabbits dying because of a housing development being built, you hate your humanity and see yourself as a bad person for the rest of your life, and now you've got to go through the high priest of the controlled left
[00:26:07.677 --> 00:26:10.955]  To prove yourself with indulgences that you pay to them.
[00:26:12.503 --> 00:26:17.666]  You have to prove yourself through political correctness that you are sanctified.
[00:26:17.666 --> 00:26:19.767]  It's a new form of religion.
[00:26:19.767 --> 00:26:22.609]  It's the same thing with other systems of political correctness.
[00:26:22.609 --> 00:26:23.609]  Racism.
[00:26:23.609 --> 00:26:23.809]  Why?
[00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:26.871]  If you don't support totally open borders, you're a racist.
[00:26:26.871 --> 00:26:33.094]  If you don't support Obamacare that hammers poor people and has death panels, you're a racist.
[00:26:33.094 --> 00:26:37.757]  If you don't support the state taking control of children, you're a racist.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:48.228]  Again, these are all forms of hen-pecking you and bullying you and making you feel guilty when you've done nothing.
[00:26:48.228 --> 00:26:52.231]  And then you look at who's pushing these ideas.
[00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:56.234]  It's a bunch of Ford Foundation operatives.
[00:26:56.234 --> 00:26:58.196]  It's a bunch of CIA operatives.
[00:26:58.196 --> 00:27:00.758]  It's a bunch of social engineers.
[00:27:00.758 --> 00:27:04.141]  It's a bunch of FBI informants like Al Sharpton.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.903]  Shining us on to their agenda.
[00:27:07.903 --> 00:27:15.570]  Do you remember this lady, MSNBC host, compares illegal immigration opponents to race segregation advocates?
[00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.011]  Melissa Harris Perry.
[00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:22.657]  Call Watson, have him add the clip in the article with her last year saying your kids belong to the state.
[00:27:22.657 --> 00:27:23.638]  To quote all of us.
[00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:41.810]  During a segment on her Saturday show, the host likened Texas Governor Rick Perry's decision to send National Guard troops to the border to Arkansas governors' move back in the 50s to use guard troops to prevent black children from attending Little Rock Central High School.
[00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:45.652]  By the way, it was a Republican Eisenhower that sent the troops in.
[00:27:47.662 --> 00:27:51.624]  And by the way, Rick Perry is a globalist on record.
[00:27:51.624 --> 00:27:52.245]  I live here.
[00:27:52.245 --> 00:27:54.186]  I know Rick Perry personally.
[00:27:54.186 --> 00:27:55.547]  He's been on this show.
[00:27:55.547 --> 00:28:02.091]  He's come over and tried to get me to join forces with him at my table at La Hueva Leone Mexican food restaurant.
[00:28:02.091 --> 00:28:03.972]  I know Rick Perry.
[00:28:03.972 --> 00:28:07.254]  He sent his representatives to talk to me repeatedly.
[00:28:07.254 --> 00:28:08.855]  I know Rick Perry.
[00:28:08.855 --> 00:28:12.237]  He's been governor like 11, 12 years.
[00:28:12.237 --> 00:28:14.018]  And Rick Perry was a Democrat.
[00:28:15.851 --> 00:28:20.252]  Rick Perry used to be for gun control, but the point is, this is how they get conservatives to support him.
[00:28:20.252 --> 00:28:22.633]  This is how the bait-and-switch works.
[00:28:22.633 --> 00:28:32.075]  Perry is going to send the guard who will then deliver the kids who are calling 911, that's in the Associated Press, to ICE, who will then legalize them.
[00:28:32.075 --> 00:28:37.197]  They're set this month to issue 5 million work permits.
[00:28:37.197 --> 00:28:41.278]  Obama has announced that they will allow basically anyone to overstay their visa.
[00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:44.600]  That is from Latin America.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:52.383]  If you're Chinese, or you're Czechoslovakian, or you're Russian, or you're South African, you are not getting to overstay your visa.
[00:28:52.383 --> 00:28:55.284]  I know the skilled labor people that are kicked out of the country.
[00:28:55.284 --> 00:29:08.449]  Again, it's very sophisticated, folks, but if you're literally unwashed, and that means no education, no future, have mental illnesses, criminal records, handicapped, baby, you're here.
[00:29:08.449 --> 00:29:11.230]  Rahm Emanuel says, come to Chicago.
[00:29:12.506 --> 00:29:13.887]  Chicago's already in collapse.
[00:29:13.887 --> 00:29:15.167]  Why would they want that?
[00:29:15.167 --> 00:29:23.811]  Because they want to accelerate it and have a permanent group that they can exploit and control that is literally owned by them.
[00:29:23.811 --> 00:29:24.752]  And it's only beginning.
[00:29:24.752 --> 00:29:25.852]  This is the end of America.
[00:29:25.852 --> 00:29:29.054]  And of course, they always use a number like a thousand.
[00:29:29.054 --> 00:29:30.494]  How about a hundred thousand?
[00:29:30.494 --> 00:29:31.635]  Again, that's a psych warfare.
[00:29:31.635 --> 00:29:32.976]  I know all the tricks.
[00:29:32.976 --> 00:29:33.576]  When we come back,
[00:29:34.616 --> 00:29:40.280]  We're going to play that clip of her saying that you're a racist if you don't want totally open borders.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.283]  But you can't go to Guatemala and have your baby for free.
[00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:45.484]  Only America.
[00:29:45.484 --> 00:29:48.447]  This is the mind control of the political takeover.
[00:29:48.447 --> 00:29:49.828]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.828 --> 00:29:51.269]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:52.330]  We are on the march.
[00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.032]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.373 --> 00:30:02.655]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:30:02.655 --> 00:30:10.079]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:20.907]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:30:20.907 --> 00:30:30.153]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:30:30.873 --> 00:30:34.935]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:30:34.935 --> 00:30:38.697]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:30:38.697 --> 00:30:40.758]  Experience the new formula.
[00:30:40.758 --> 00:30:43.339]  Experience the ancient purity.

[00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:21.163]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:31:21.163 --> 00:31:31.792]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:31:31.792 --> 00:31:38.277]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:03.166]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:04.408]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:32:04.408 --> 00:32:05.729]  God knows what's in this.
[00:32:05.729 --> 00:32:09.975]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:32:09.975 --> 00:32:15.742]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:32:15.862 --> 00:32:16.942]  That one is better.
[00:32:16.942 --> 00:32:18.183]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:32:18.183 --> 00:32:19.584]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:32:19.584 --> 00:32:20.244]  It's good water.
[00:32:20.244 --> 00:32:26.227]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:32:26.227 --> 00:32:33.470]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.171]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:44.075]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:32:44.235 --> 00:32:45.256]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:32:45.256 --> 00:32:46.437]  It's good water.
[00:32:46.437 --> 00:32:47.058]  Refreshing?
[00:32:47.058 --> 00:32:47.679]  It's good!

[00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:32.491]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:32.491 --> 00:33:33.271]  Central.
[00:33:33.271 --> 00:33:36.253]  Re-aired on stations across the country as well.
[00:33:36.253 --> 00:33:37.873]  Simulcast on Global Shortwave.
[00:33:37.873 --> 00:33:41.075]  Those listings are all online at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:41.075 --> 00:33:42.656]  We have a World Service.
[00:33:42.656 --> 00:33:46.638]  We get letters from missionaries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, you name it.
[00:33:46.638 --> 00:33:49.599]  Listen to us on WWCR World Service.
[00:33:49.599 --> 00:33:52.141]  And then of course we are the number one political talk show.
[00:33:53.021 --> 00:33:56.742]  on the internet, bar none, if you look at it in the aggregate.
[00:33:56.742 --> 00:34:04.364]  And I even have an email from some of the top-level folks at YouTube saying, wow, we want to work with you.
[00:34:04.364 --> 00:34:10.146]  You are now undoubtedly the biggest political show on YouTube.
[00:34:10.146 --> 00:34:20.229]  Looking at all the different channels that carry your material, undoubtedly you are the biggest operation on YouTube when it comes to political news and information.
[00:34:20.229 --> 00:34:21.129]  We want to work with you.
[00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:25.691]  People say, well, what does that mean when YouTube wants to work with you as a division of Google?
[00:34:25.691 --> 00:34:30.514]  Well, the average compartmentalized person at YouTube is not a bad person.
[00:34:30.514 --> 00:34:33.116]  And we have to be ready for success.
[00:34:33.116 --> 00:34:42.041]  We have to be ready to supplant the old order, which is tyranny, with the really old order that is beating on the human breast, liberty.
[00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:49.556]  Again, with all of our official channels together, we've got about 600 million views.
[00:34:49.556 --> 00:34:56.943]  You count some of the other channels, conservatively, 800 million views.
[00:34:56.943 --> 00:34:58.184]  800 million views.
[00:34:58.184 --> 00:35:00.966]  And I'm not trying to brag here today.
[00:35:00.966 --> 00:35:06.552]  I want you to know out there that we are just one operation promoting freedom.
[00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:21.839]  And there are literally hundreds and hundreds of other channels outpost of liberty on YouTube that have got 10 million, 20 million, 50 million, 60 million, 100 million views that have only been around a few years.
[00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:35.546]  And when I see some talk show host or some documentary maker who's doing a better job than I am, we highlight those videos on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:35.546 --> 00:35:36.967]  I get excited
[00:35:40.049 --> 00:35:46.976]  About finding other YouTube channels that are promoting liberty, and in some cases I think doing a better job than I do.
[00:35:46.976 --> 00:35:55.424]  And then sometimes I'll see they've got a little hit piece on me or something, but overall there's not a lot of hit pieces on there, and so I'm very pleased.
[00:35:55.424 --> 00:35:59.487]  Because I don't care about being attacked, that's a mark of being successful.
[00:35:59.487 --> 00:36:00.508]  And your children
[00:36:01.528 --> 00:36:06.834]  We'll also basically later in life try to differentiate and rebel against you.
[00:36:06.834 --> 00:36:16.305]  And so I've woken up and my listeners have woken up, this operation has woken up so many tens of millions of people conservatively worldwide, tens of millions of the US alone.
[00:36:17.629 --> 00:36:29.459]  That I expect people to go through that differentiation period, uh, where they will then see the fault in me, because we all have fault, or the distorted fault, and will be angry with me.
[00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:36.425]  And I totally understand, and I thank everyone out there who does try to reprove me.
[00:36:36.425 --> 00:36:42.771]  You know, some people say, Alex, you know, you say you're this Christian, but, uh, you know, you play rock and roll music on your show.
[00:36:43.749 --> 00:36:48.571]  Well, I'm not up here thumping the Bible telling you you're a bad person and I'm holier than thou.
[00:36:48.571 --> 00:36:49.492]  I'm not a Pharisee.
[00:36:49.492 --> 00:36:53.674]  I don't tell you to get the speck out of your eye.
[00:36:53.674 --> 00:36:58.236]  I tell you to try to be a good person and to try to stand up for human liberty and freedom.
[00:36:58.236 --> 00:37:02.799]  You're not going to hear these megachurches talking about going to the abortuaries and trying to stop abortions.
[00:37:03.499 --> 00:37:08.921]  You're not going to hear these big megachurches speaking out against Obama or the open borders or global government.
[00:37:08.921 --> 00:37:17.143]  You're going to see them promoting it, but talking all day about how good they are and how you can name it and how you can claim it.
[00:37:17.143 --> 00:37:22.824]  So I never said that I wasn't wicked as the day is long.
[00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:23.925]  Let's get that straight.
[00:37:23.925 --> 00:37:24.985]  And I like the energy.
[00:37:26.627 --> 00:37:31.569]  of Metallica or Megadeth, you know, Dave Mustaine is a Christian, you know, coming in.
[00:37:31.569 --> 00:37:45.115]  I have found that people that are open about their dark side or who I want to be around, let me tell you, you better watch these people that act like they're holier than thou and act like how good they are all day and lecture you all day about how you're a devil.
[00:37:45.115 --> 00:37:51.478]  You better watch them real close because the devil masquerades as an angel of light, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:51.478 --> 00:37:53.019]  I've got strong flesh.
[00:37:54.775 --> 00:38:00.467]  That's why I understand the globalists, because I can tune in to darkness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:01.727 --> 00:38:04.769]  But my heart loves God.
[00:38:04.769 --> 00:38:06.750]  And my heart loves the innocent.
[00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.851]  And my heart loves justice.
[00:38:08.851 --> 00:38:12.813]  And I'm ready to die before I screw anybody over.
[00:38:12.813 --> 00:38:14.834]  And before I abuse the ignorant.
[00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:16.875]  And before I do anything to the children.
[00:38:16.875 --> 00:38:18.215]  Suffer the little children.
[00:38:18.215 --> 00:38:21.337]  Better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself in the deepest sea.
[00:38:21.337 --> 00:38:22.338]  And who are the children?
[00:38:22.338 --> 00:38:24.038]  They're the handicaps.
[00:38:24.038 --> 00:38:24.819]  They're the veterans.
[00:38:26.246 --> 00:38:27.687]  They are the little children.
[00:38:27.687 --> 00:38:29.047]  They're the old people.
[00:38:29.047 --> 00:38:32.388]  The children are people that are under your control.
[00:38:32.388 --> 00:38:40.591]  The children are people that are in your stead, that are in your care, that you're a steward of.
[00:38:40.591 --> 00:38:42.072]  Are veterans children?
[00:38:42.072 --> 00:38:43.052]  No.
[00:38:43.052 --> 00:38:53.156]  But they're treated like children by the system and put into a position where they're treated like children, treated like they are basically been declared mentally unfit.
[00:38:53.683 --> 00:39:01.926]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:39:01.926 --> 00:39:07.388]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[00:39:07.388 --> 00:39:13.730]  If you look at what the technocracy and monsters like Melissa Harris-Perry are doing, they are declaring all of us unfit.
[00:39:14.926 --> 00:39:18.767]  They are declaring all of us malfunctioning.
[00:39:18.767 --> 00:39:24.648]  They are declaring all of us to be institutionalized.
[00:39:24.648 --> 00:39:27.109]  They're declaring us incompetent.
[00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:38.472]  That's what the whole welfare system, criminal justice system, media system, college system, all of it is about declaring you unfit.
[00:39:40.831 --> 00:39:42.693]  Declaring you incompetent.
[00:39:42.693 --> 00:39:55.004]  They run the PSYOP and put the troops on drugs early, and put them in too many tours, and then tell them they're mentally ill, but don't worry, you'll get your benefits as long as you waive your rights, and say you have PTSD, and then run this operation.
[00:39:55.004 --> 00:40:04.213]  I can't tell you how many vets I know who finally got off all the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the SSRIs, and the opiates that they put them on, and look ten years younger.
[00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:14.495]  And are healthy, and understand the mind game that was played on them, and understand the way to get better is to realize they're in an info war against the globalists, and the innocents need them.
[00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:19.117]  And sure, they were rode hard and put away wet, but they're not going to let the globalists run that mind game on them.
[00:40:19.117 --> 00:40:26.841]  They're going to break their conditioning, and decide they have value, and not buy into the PSYOP that something's wrong with them!
[00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:32.604]  Nine times out of ten, the troops I personally know, the veterans I know, can reverse that mind game.
[00:40:32.604 --> 00:40:33.485]  By helping others.
[00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:40.276]  And getting back in the game, this time for the battle for the Republic.
[00:40:40.276 --> 00:40:55.191]  So this simpering snake, this fascist, authoritarian kleptocrat, literally using psych warfare from the Ford Foundation, where she was trained in the Obama administration, the Clinton administration, to savagely go on television.
[00:40:55.811 --> 00:41:18.431]  And brutalize, quote, minorities who are the majority now in most areas of the country, and tell them that whites are their enemies, and tell them that anyone that doesn't want a North American Union, and totally collapse borders, and tens of millions of people here having their babies for free, and a huge new political welfare class, that anyone that doesn't wholesale run up a white flag to her is a racist!
[00:41:19.775 --> 00:41:22.195]  Your kids belong to us, or you're racist!
[00:41:22.195 --> 00:41:24.616]  The borders are wide open, or you're racist!
[00:41:24.616 --> 00:41:26.696]  And she sits there flogging it!
[00:41:26.696 --> 00:41:34.878]  You can watch them reading the teleprompters, like literal generals turning to each other, and then nodding to each other as they savagely run their op!
[00:41:34.878 --> 00:41:39.458]  These people are so wicked, you can't even imagine the operations they're running!
[00:41:39.458 --> 00:41:42.039]  They are high-fying the bring-down of this country!
[00:41:42.039 --> 00:41:44.599]  They're not liberal ideologues that mean well!
[00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:46.280]  They are commandos!
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.360]  They are psych warfare generals!
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.362]  That is not rhetoric.
[00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:53.067]  They will attack and attack and attack.
[00:41:53.067 --> 00:41:55.871]  They are the enemy of you and your family 110%.
[00:41:55.871 --> 00:42:03.503]  And until you realize that they are trained... ...military might of the National Guard to defend ourselves against them.
[00:42:04.338 --> 00:42:23.867]  Could we please pause for a moment here and remember that we are talking about children who are vulnerable, unprotected, and afraid, who are fleeing extreme violence and poverty in their home countries, drawn to the United States border by our nation's reputation as a place where children are valued, precious, and protected.
[00:42:23.867 --> 00:42:28.269]  And to some extent, what they have found here is as good as what is advertised.
[00:42:28.269 --> 00:42:30.770]  There are people of the Rio Grande Valley.
[00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:44.659]  Despite being at the epicenter of the surge in children and families crossing the border, have stepped up to support their region's strained resources with thousands of hours of volunteer time, food, shelter, and emotional support for the migrant kids.
[00:42:44.659 --> 00:42:57.528]  Then, there was Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, who last week offered temporary shelter for up to 1,000 unaccompanied minors, citing what he called America's century-long tradition of giving sanctuary to desperate children.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:08.207]  And if we look to that history, we do indeed see there are moments when children have been the catalyst that moved Americans to push beyond their own biases and borders, both national and racial.
[00:43:08.207 --> 00:43:20.135]  In May of 1963, the Children's Crusade, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, brought more than 3,000 young people to the city of Birmingham, Alabama in a show of civil disobedience against segregation in the city.
[00:43:20.815 --> 00:43:30.787]  Once Americans saw those images of children standing courageously against injustice, the tide of national public opinion took a pivotal turn in support of the Civil Rights Movement's cause.
[00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:40.854]  But we can't embrace that moment of America's moral fortitude without also owning the great moral failing to which it was responding.
[00:43:40.854 --> 00:43:52.200]  Because the children at the border have also been confronted with a hostility that is as old as the segregated South and just as American as the grace and charity of those to whom have extended a hand of help.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:44:01.731]  And if we are to claim our history in protecting vulnerable children, we must also grapple with our history of responding to them as a threat when their presence undermines an established order.
[00:44:02.538 --> 00:44:03.198]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:44:30.305 --> 00:44:33.787]  Then she goes into Rick Perry again as she began.
[00:44:33.787 --> 00:44:52.218]  Rick Perry has put a thousand Border Patrol National Guard down there to simply give the illegals, most of them are adults, to the Border Patrol and ICE who then give them green cards and work permits.
[00:44:52.218 --> 00:44:54.079]  That's on record.
[00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:57.621]  So see, this is how they give left cover to the controlled Republican Party.
[00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:05.787]  You got conservatives saluting Rick Perry everywhere for, quote, putting a thousand troops down there.
[00:45:05.787 --> 00:45:19.178]  But all they're doing on record, we played the clip last week, is responding to the 911 calls and helping the police and state police that are overwhelmed give the illegals to ICE who then promptly legalizes them.
[00:45:19.178 --> 00:45:20.339]  It's in the headlines today.
[00:45:20.339 --> 00:45:27.265]  Amnesty work permits for five million, ordered within weeks, LA Times.
[00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:32.553]  Visa overstays to be excused.
[00:45:32.553 --> 00:45:33.155]  LA Times.
[00:45:37.918 --> 00:45:48.704]  I mean, this is what's going on, and it's MS-13, and it's adults, and it's smugglers inside of these facilities with the teenagers, average age 15, using them.
[00:45:48.704 --> 00:45:50.786]  And they don't even have real names.
[00:45:50.786 --> 00:46:04.914]  A lot of these kids are being exploited and used, and being invited up here by the Democratic Party, who went down to Guatemala a year ago to set this up, and Mexico, telling them, come here, come here, have your babies, come here, here, we'll put you on birth control, because you're getting pregnant.
[00:46:05.947 --> 00:46:11.369]  We're going to waive all of our laws and invite wave after wave, effectively getting rid of our border.
[00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:25.595]  And if you don't do it, you're like a Democrat governor in Arkansas trying to keep black kids out of school so that a Republican president stops you.
[00:46:25.595 --> 00:46:35.539]  And then you put up this technician, Perry, Melissa Harris Perry, who says your kids belong to the state.
[00:46:36.943 --> 00:46:49.026]  They put her up there to say you are collectively racist if you don't want to legalize the children and they show shots of three and four-year-olds lying on cots and sleeping bags.
[00:46:49.026 --> 00:46:54.727]  Who encouraged this?
[00:46:54.727 --> 00:46:58.368]  We didn't make Guatemala be a total hellhole.
[00:46:58.368 --> 00:47:02.149]  We didn't make Venezuela be a total hellhole.
[00:47:02.149 --> 00:47:05.010]  The whole world's being told you come to America
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:12.043]  The children are there to be shipped to America.
[00:47:12.043 --> 00:47:17.946]  You live in a country, the children live there, then America is supposed to take the children.
[00:47:17.946 --> 00:47:21.107]  America exists to take the children.
[00:47:21.107 --> 00:47:32.133]  Remember Obama two weeks ago came out and said that the United States and his administration has spread just absolute stability and happiness
[00:47:33.326 --> 00:47:34.267]  All over the world.
[00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:35.068]  Remember that?
[00:47:35.068 --> 00:47:36.309]  Here's the exact headline.
[00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:41.994]  White House, we substantially improve the tranquility of global community.
[00:47:41.994 --> 00:47:49.621]  The truth is the world is melting down under global devaluation of the dollar that the globalists have carried out.
[00:47:49.621 --> 00:47:54.105]  All other major currencies pegged to the dollar are being devalued at warm speed right now.
[00:47:54.105 --> 00:47:54.706]  The planet
[00:47:56.408 --> 00:47:59.131]  ...is descending into new world order destabilization.
[00:47:59.131 --> 00:48:08.502]  The IMF World Bank admitted program is to destabilize third world countries and the genotic states and use those crises to bring in a planetary technocracy.
[00:48:08.502 --> 00:48:10.043]  But the average person doesn't know that.
[00:48:10.043 --> 00:48:16.651]  They just say, look at images of white men in a few isolated cities with police dogs biting black people.
[00:48:19.744 --> 00:48:27.548]  Well, if you don't accept totally open borders in the North American Union, you want police dogs to bite black people.
[00:48:27.548 --> 00:48:31.350]  That's the mindless level of the psychology that they're using.
[00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:47.339]  And they plan to fully break the border and bring in unlimited groups who are not skilled, who are not middle class, who will work for the Democrats, and who will work as basically minimum wage slaves getting a supplemental of welfare.
[00:48:47.339 --> 00:48:48.741]  That's the new model.
[00:48:48.741 --> 00:48:51.805]  Making them totally dependent and they will vote however they're told.
[00:48:52.847 --> 00:48:58.111]  This is the conquest of America, and the conquest of our children and everything else.
[00:48:58.111 --> 00:49:06.017]  And if you want to be a slave, and if you want to allow these people to be brought here and be exploited, then support what this monster is putting out.
[00:49:06.017 --> 00:49:09.640]  Now, this is an example of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:17.126]  Madeleine Albright, the Secretary of State under Clinton, told CBS Face the Nation that the world is a mess.
[00:49:17.126 --> 00:49:18.087]  No, no, no.
[00:49:18.087 --> 00:49:21.269]  Obama and the Democrats have brought tranquility.
[00:49:21.269 --> 00:49:21.690]  Here it is.
[00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:23.630]  It's happening in the Middle East.
[00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:38.493]  A lot of it due to the Arab awakening and also the artificiality of the borders that were established after World War I. So, these are huge game changers and we are, a lot of Americans, trying to figure out where the countries are.
[00:49:38.493 --> 00:49:40.914]  Most Americans knew very little about Islam.
[00:49:40.914 --> 00:49:43.674]  They certainly didn't know a difference between Shia and Sunni.
[00:49:43.674 --> 00:49:48.835]  So, there are an awful lot of things going on that need understanding and explanation.
[00:49:48.835 --> 00:49:51.156]  But, to put it mildly, the world is a mess.
[00:49:52.213 --> 00:49:54.134]  To put it mildly, the world is a mess.
[00:49:54.134 --> 00:49:57.575]  And who's behind the Arab Spring on record?
[00:49:57.575 --> 00:50:00.015]  Madeleine?
[00:50:00.015 --> 00:50:03.536]  Who was behind that?
[00:50:03.536 --> 00:50:09.838]  Oh, on record, Google, the Forge Foundation, the Soros Group, the Open Societies.
[00:50:09.838 --> 00:50:11.398]  Soros brags he's behind that.
[00:50:11.398 --> 00:50:14.779]  He's behind Ukraine, overthrowing that government, starting all that.
[00:50:14.779 --> 00:50:16.260]  And behind the open borders here.
[00:50:17.281 --> 00:50:18.622]  But you heard her.
[00:50:18.622 --> 00:50:21.284]  The solution is not having borders at all.
[00:50:21.284 --> 00:50:21.664]  That's right.
[00:50:21.664 --> 00:50:25.166]  Overthrow Saddam, a stabilizer.
[00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:28.489]  And now let Al-Qaeda take over much of that area.
[00:50:28.489 --> 00:50:33.292]  You see, they create the crisis and then they offer the solution.
[00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:38.452]  But at least he told the truth, one little truth in there, that the world's a mess.
[00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:45.357]  Yes, they have to create a mess to then bring in their solution, a wider war with Russia.
[00:50:45.357 --> 00:50:50.080]  Another invasion of Iraq, another invasion of North Africa.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.963]  Oh, we gotta have our troops in Africa because of Al-Qaeda, who our government put in there.
[00:50:54.963 --> 00:50:56.363]  Who gave them the heat-seeking missiles?
[00:50:56.363 --> 00:50:57.004]  Our government.
[00:50:59.184 --> 00:51:04.509]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[00:51:04.509 --> 00:51:06.510]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:10.293]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[00:51:10.293 --> 00:51:14.497]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[00:51:14.497 --> 00:51:21.223]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.
[00:51:21.223 --> 00:51:25.086]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.

[00:51:28.695 --> 00:51:32.237]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird.
[00:51:32.237 --> 00:51:36.598]  Because they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases.
[00:51:36.598 --> 00:51:38.899]  Then my folks both got a Blocket Pocket.
[00:51:38.899 --> 00:51:41.701]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation.
[00:51:41.701 --> 00:51:44.342]  Dad knows it keeps his information private.
[00:51:44.342 --> 00:51:47.363]  I like my Blocket Pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking.
[00:51:47.363 --> 00:51:48.284]  Awesome!
[00:51:48.284 --> 00:51:50.665]  BlocketPocket.com has other cool stuff too.
[00:51:50.665 --> 00:51:53.186]  Huh, guess my parents aren't so weird.

[00:52:01.048 --> 00:52:06.172]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.172 --> 00:52:14.298]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:18.822]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:18.822 --> 00:52:22.645]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:22.785 --> 00:52:28.730]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.912]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:31.912 --> 00:52:37.277]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:30.310]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:34.612]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:53:34.612 --> 00:53:36.013]  Silverlungs.com.

[00:53:44.036 --> 00:53:45.937]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:53:45.937 --> 00:53:51.500]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:55.301]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[00:53:55.301 --> 00:53:56.802]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[00:54:16.383 --> 00:54:24.248]  No one in the world has borders this open.
[00:54:24.248 --> 00:54:30.052]  No one sees the wages going down faster than they are in this country right now.
[00:54:30.052 --> 00:54:39.979]  The globalists want you poor, want you stupid, want you third world, want you dumbed down, so they can absolutely control and dominate the future.
[00:54:39.979 --> 00:54:41.100]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:54:42.026 --> 00:54:47.971]  MSNBC host compares illegal immigration opponents to race segregation advocates.
[00:54:47.971 --> 00:54:56.218]  And she says, we can use the image of the children to get these borders open.
[00:54:56.218 --> 00:54:58.360]  77% want illegals sent home.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:05.186]  81% say it's a serious crime in a new national poll, including Democrats.
[00:55:09.426 --> 00:55:24.510]  Obama is set, according to the Associated Press, to try to get enough green cards in the new immigration bill to legalize everyone in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.
[00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:26.751]  I mean, this is such a bold plan.
[00:55:26.751 --> 00:55:27.931]  How would you conquer America?
[00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:31.793]  I mean, you would do this.
[00:55:31.793 --> 00:55:33.193]  I mean, it's game over, people.
[00:55:36.124 --> 00:55:38.485]  If this doesn't make people leave the U.S., I don't know what will.
[00:55:38.485 --> 00:55:42.707]  I mean, I don't want to live in Honduras or Guatemala.
[00:55:42.707 --> 00:55:44.847]  Illegals demand representation in the White House.
[00:55:44.847 --> 00:55:46.568]  Washington Times.
[00:55:46.568 --> 00:55:48.429]  They've picketed the White House.
[00:55:48.429 --> 00:55:52.330]  They want immigrant groups to be represented by the White House.
[00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:56.032]  You are represented by the White House that wants to use you.
[00:55:56.032 --> 00:56:02.534]  Violent transnational gangs recruiting unaccompanied minors at border security facilities.
[00:56:02.534 --> 00:56:03.815]  Daily Mail report on that.
[00:56:05.307 --> 00:56:10.051]  Children crossing border tell reporters Obama will take care of us.
[00:56:10.051 --> 00:56:11.852]  World Net Daily.
[00:56:11.852 --> 00:56:16.876]  White House pursuing plan to expand immigrant rights.
[00:56:16.876 --> 00:56:17.157]  L.A.
[00:56:17.157 --> 00:56:18.998]  Times.
[00:56:18.998 --> 00:56:25.824]  Including giving out 5 million work permits within the next two weeks.
[00:56:25.824 --> 00:56:26.364]  That's L.A.
[00:56:26.364 --> 00:56:27.445]  Times.
[00:56:27.445 --> 00:56:30.247]  And stopping all deportations.
[00:56:30.247 --> 00:56:31.728]  It's down over 90 plus percent.
[00:56:31.728 --> 00:56:32.569]  Now all.
[00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:34.831]  Just the message is you get here, you're legal.
[00:56:38.271 --> 00:56:44.392]  Paul Watson was thinking about coming here after 12 years working for me and living in Austin.
[00:56:44.392 --> 00:56:46.733]  And I said, hey man, just let's do it as a test.
[00:56:46.733 --> 00:56:48.613]  Just come here and be illegal.
[00:56:48.613 --> 00:56:50.734]  Just get a visa.
[00:56:50.734 --> 00:56:51.594]  But we looked into it.
[00:56:51.594 --> 00:56:52.474]  That won't be allowed.
[00:56:52.474 --> 00:56:54.535]  Oh, they'll come after him.
[00:56:54.535 --> 00:56:55.335]  He has a job.
[00:56:55.335 --> 00:56:56.395]  He's going to pay taxes here.
[00:56:56.395 --> 00:56:58.116]  Uh-uh, buddy.
[00:56:58.116 --> 00:57:01.756]  Do not want you.
[00:57:01.756 --> 00:57:04.057]  It's next to near impossible to get anybody over here.
[00:57:05.046 --> 00:57:06.855]  You got a mining engineer degree?
[00:57:06.855 --> 00:57:07.680]  You're a scientist?
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.223]  Not gonna happen.
[00:57:08.223 --> 00:57:08.705]  We don't want you.
[00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:15.933]  More Mexican immigrants illegals with TB, drug resistant TB, go missing from facilities.
[00:57:15.933 --> 00:57:17.834]  That's in the Gateway Pundit.
[00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:22.116]  GOP says Border Patrol agents handcuffed by wildlife rules.
[00:57:22.116 --> 00:57:23.596]  Yeah, can't drive around out there.
[00:57:23.596 --> 00:57:25.998]  But don't worry, Rahm Emanuel says come to Chicago.
[00:57:25.998 --> 00:57:33.361]  They want an even bigger underclass they can use to menace the taxpayers and raise all the real estate taxes and the rest of it.
[00:57:33.361 --> 00:57:38.804]  Briefly, before we go to break and come back and get into a ton of other international financial news I haven't gotten to,
[00:57:41.167 --> 00:57:47.392]  I have not taken my mystery substance that won't be out for a few months at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:57:47.392 --> 00:57:48.433]  I haven't taken it today.
[00:57:48.433 --> 00:57:52.756]  And then I'll put my super male vitality, a couple squirts of that.
[00:57:52.756 --> 00:57:55.679]  I did remember to take that this morning.
[00:57:55.679 --> 00:58:00.863]  And I have not taken my super nascent iodine from the deep earth crystal source that nobody else has.
[00:58:00.863 --> 00:58:06.827]  So I will put it into my bottled water here.
[00:58:06.827 --> 00:58:08.569]  Shake it up.
[00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:10.150]  And bottoms up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:13.135 --> 00:58:14.276]  Infowarslife.com

[00:58:45.629 --> 00:58:46.630]  Shop with the good guys.
[00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:47.531]  Keep supporting us.
[00:58:47.531 --> 00:58:48.332]  I thank you for it.
[00:58:49.246 --> 00:58:51.628]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:54.450]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:58:54.450 --> 00:59:00.634]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:59:00.634 --> 00:59:05.718]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:59:05.718 --> 00:59:10.602]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:59:10.602 --> 00:59:15.105]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:59:15.405 --> 00:59:24.012]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:59:24.012 --> 00:59:26.174]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:59:26.174 --> 00:59:37.363]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:59:37.363 --> 00:59:44.769]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.

[00:59:52.338 --> 00:59:54.720]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.503]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:10.116]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.116 --> 01:00:11.718]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.718 --> 01:00:13.260]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:17.445]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.445 --> 01:00:21.510]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.101 --> 01:00:58.842]  The brazenness, the nakedness, the arrogance, the chutzpah, the bravado, the hubris, the sickening feeling of invincibility that these wicked, wicked social engineers, who want you impoverished, who want you dumb... You know, I've seen this statistically, but I've experienced it in my life as well.
[01:00:59.798 --> 01:01:10.045]  That environmentalists, people that claim they're big do-gooders, are six times more likely to steal in a Canadian study, even more likely to steal in a British study.
[01:01:10.045 --> 01:01:13.067]  London Guardian reported on how rude they are, how they steal.
[01:01:13.067 --> 01:01:22.374]  But I found this also with Christians that tell you what great Christians they are, and are always telling you that you aren't a good Christian.
[01:01:23.578 --> 01:01:26.140]  They use it as a moral authority.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:32.825]  I would liken them to the money-changing Pharisees that Christ whipped in the temple.
[01:01:32.825 --> 01:01:42.372]  And time and time again, if somebody tells me what a good Christian they are, and tells me I better watch it because I might be of the devil, they're not really reproving me.
[01:01:42.372 --> 01:01:43.973]  It's a certain spirit.
[01:01:43.973 --> 01:01:45.254]  I pick up on it right away.
[01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:48.851]  And then they end up being the thieves.
[01:01:48.851 --> 01:01:50.792]  They end up being the criminals.
[01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:52.333]  They end up being the bad people.
[01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:53.273]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:01:53.273 --> 01:01:55.694]  How going green might make you mean.
[01:01:55.694 --> 01:01:59.697]  Ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to steal.
[01:01:59.697 --> 01:02:01.838]  Study finds.
[01:02:01.838 --> 01:02:13.845]  And again, this is a real phenomenon and when you see the folks on MSNBC, CNN, they know what they're doing.
[01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:31.302]  They study propaganda, they study disinformation, and they are literally wanting to keep you politically on their plantation, on their reservation, under their control.
[01:02:31.302 --> 01:02:34.144]  And I know most of you are aware of that, most of you understand that.
[01:02:34.144 --> 01:02:44.111]  We have a guest in the Culture Wars joining us, a filmmaker with a hot new film coming out based on his book written decades ago that predicted a dystopia.
[01:02:44.111 --> 01:02:44.812]  So I want to compare the...
[01:02:45.686 --> 01:02:46.707]  I didn't really plug properly either.
[01:02:46.707 --> 01:02:48.508]  I hate to get sped up on the show and then
[01:03:05.504 --> 01:03:07.185]  Not properly plug things.
[01:03:07.185 --> 01:03:34.807]  I was talking about the proprietary, pure, non-GMO, highest standards, trailblazing supplements at Infowarslife.com as we went to break earlier, and despite the fact that I have a highly stressful lifestyle, despite the fact that I do a lot of things that obviously aren't good for my body, and have been through a lot in my life as well that I won't get into,
[01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:53.941]  It has been life-changing what the proprietary X2 and regular Survival Shield have done for me, what the Super Metal Vitality has done, what the Lung Cleanse has done, when I have a sore throat or something, what the Colloidal Silver, if it's bacterial, what that's been able to do for me, it's just amazing.
[01:03:53.941 --> 01:03:57.923]  And again, we did sell out of the Silver Bullet the last time we produced it.
[01:03:57.923 --> 01:03:59.744]  Didn't have it for two and a half months.
[01:03:59.744 --> 01:04:04.366]  At the current rate of sales, we will sell out very, very soon, so if you want this,
[01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:11.951]  I mean, the best we could get, the best produced nano silver we could get, and super strong.
[01:04:11.951 --> 01:04:14.653]  I don't recommend daily use of it myself personally.
[01:04:14.653 --> 01:04:15.473]  Check with your physician.
[01:04:15.473 --> 01:04:16.894]  I'd use this when you're sick.
[01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:17.454]  That's what I'd do.
[01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:18.355]  Again, check with your physician.
[01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.496]  I'm not giving out medical advice here.
[01:04:20.496 --> 01:04:26.099]  Infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com takes you to the big store.
[01:04:26.099 --> 01:04:28.440]  Infowarslife.com takes you to the subsection or 888-253-3139.
[01:04:32.182 --> 01:04:34.803]  I've gotten complaints before from shortwave and AM listeners.
[01:04:34.803 --> 01:04:38.045]  They say, hey man, you talk too fast when you give that number out.
[01:04:38.045 --> 01:04:40.045]  It's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:40.045 --> 01:04:51.850]  And you get the extra good feeling knowing that you're supporting an absolutely, openly, viciously pro-liberty organization.
[01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:55.412]  I mean, we just are no holds barred, no teleprompters, no games.
[01:04:55.412 --> 01:04:57.113]  We wear our heart on our sleeves.
[01:04:59.787 --> 01:05:05.936]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:10.503]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:05:10.503 --> 01:05:15.070]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:18.391]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:05:18.391 --> 01:05:23.834]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:31.237]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:05:31.237 --> 01:05:35.378]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:05:35.378 --> 01:05:40.481]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:41.321]  This is innovating.
[01:05:41.621 --> 01:05:48.951]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:05:48.951 --> 01:05:53.376]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:05:53.376 --> 01:05:58.824]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super Detox Special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:59.994 --> 01:06:02.276]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:06:02.276 --> 01:06:09.700]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:20.528]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:06:20.528 --> 01:06:29.774]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:06:30.494 --> 01:06:34.576]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:06:34.576 --> 01:06:38.318]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:06:38.318 --> 01:06:40.379]  Experience the new formula.
[01:06:40.379 --> 01:06:42.961]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:44.301]  Shield your family.
[01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.102]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:49.264]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:49.264 --> 01:06:53.226]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:58.177 --> 01:07:05.325]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:07.687]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:07:07.687 --> 01:07:12.973]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:07:12.973 --> 01:07:17.918]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:21.441]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:07:21.441 --> 01:07:25.525]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:07:25.525 --> 01:07:29.850]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:40.079]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:42.602]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:07:42.762 --> 01:07:45.965]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.464 --> 01:08:20.088]  The article just broke on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:20.088 --> 01:08:23.971]  It has not made national news yet.
[01:08:23.971 --> 01:08:26.313]  It is now going to make national news.
[01:08:26.313 --> 01:08:33.499]  It's from KRGV News on the border here in Texas.
[01:08:35.453 --> 01:08:40.821]  It is confirmed we'll play the newscast at the bottom of the hour after our guest leaves us.
[01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:45.568]  In the event of emergency, hold on to your hats for this one, but it's par for the course.
[01:08:45.568 --> 01:08:49.193]  Illegals to be evacuated before citizens.
[01:08:50.239 --> 01:09:01.523]  Should a hurricane or other life-threatening catastrophic weather event impact South Texas, illegal aliens occupying various shelters will be first in line to get to safer ground, close quote.
[01:09:01.523 --> 01:09:14.127]  A National Weather Service coordinator says this is at a meeting this week with emergency managers in the Rio Grande Valley region, where even small towns have spent millions in the last year taking care of the giant influx.
[01:09:15.083 --> 01:09:24.307]  They address the reality that in addition to picking up the tab for putting the immigrants up, they also are accepting responsibility for their safety.
[01:09:24.307 --> 01:09:26.788]  That's taxation without representation.
[01:09:26.788 --> 01:09:28.308]  Why doesn't Obama pay for it?
[01:09:28.308 --> 01:09:33.591]  Or I guess you've got MSNBC hosts saying, you're racist if you don't want totally open borders.
[01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:36.031]  And you're racist if you don't like Obamacare either.
[01:09:36.031 --> 01:09:39.033]  Again, it's this moral, high-ground garbage.
[01:09:40.003 --> 01:09:41.243]  It's social engineering.
[01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.044]  It's globalism.
[01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.244]  It's game over.
[01:09:43.244 --> 01:09:47.105]  A lot of libertarians say, hey, like Jesse Ventura, and I'm getting him on in a few weeks.
[01:09:47.105 --> 01:09:48.166]  God love him.
[01:09:48.166 --> 01:09:50.786]  He's like, I like Mexico.
[01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.227]  I think we ought to have an open border.
[01:09:52.227 --> 01:09:53.327]  We ought to have freedom.
[01:09:53.327 --> 01:09:54.007]  Libertarian.
[01:09:54.007 --> 01:09:55.088]  I'm not afraid of danger.
[01:09:55.088 --> 01:09:57.528]  I don't want any checkpoints at the airport.
[01:09:57.528 --> 01:09:59.729]  Which I agree with no checkpoints at the airport.
[01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:02.430]  You know, don't give in to fear, Alex.
[01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:04.170]  It's that, it's not that.
[01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:05.951]  It's that they come here and get on welfare.
[01:10:07.301 --> 01:10:09.602]  Well, I like brown people, Alex.
[01:10:09.602 --> 01:10:20.208]  Yes, I know, I don't dislike them either, Jesse, but they get put on welfare and become political fodder of the Democrats.
[01:10:20.208 --> 01:10:25.530]  I mean, it's just like, Jesse's real smart in ways, and other ways, he just doesn't get it.
[01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:30.653]  And people say, if Aventura's on his own TV show, you know, saying this stuff, look, I get it.
[01:10:30.653 --> 01:10:32.734]  He's a good, he is a real libertarian, folks.
[01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:35.137]  He just says total freedom.
[01:10:35.137 --> 01:10:44.863]  But you can't do that when you border a collapsing authoritarian string of kleptocracies.
[01:10:44.863 --> 01:10:47.685]  But it makes me admire Jesse even more that he's so real.
[01:10:47.685 --> 01:10:49.426]  I mean, he really believes in freedom.
[01:10:49.426 --> 01:10:49.727]  He just...
[01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:53.107]  Like other Libertarians I know, he just doesn't get it.
[01:10:53.107 --> 01:10:55.168]  By the way, we have an iconic Libertarian.
[01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:57.209]  A lot of his books have been turned into films.
[01:10:57.209 --> 01:11:00.291]  Ron Paul is in his new film.
[01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:04.553]  And of course, Kevin Sorbo, Hercules, was on a few weeks ago with us.
[01:11:04.553 --> 01:11:05.513]  He's in it as well.
[01:11:08.704 --> 01:11:09.905]  I'm very excited to have him on.
[01:11:09.905 --> 01:11:12.688]  He's the author of ten books, including three novels.
[01:11:12.688 --> 01:11:26.580]  He's the writer, producer, director of the new pro-libertarian, near-future suspense thriller film, alongside Night, which he adapted from his 1979 novel of the same name, that really mirrors what we're starting to see happen.
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:29.623]  The novel was endorsed by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman.
[01:11:30.063 --> 01:11:43.077]  A Clockwork Orange author, Anthony Burgess, and Dr. Ron Paul, as well as having received rave reviews in magazines and newspapers, including Reason and the Los Angeles Times Book Review, alongside NightMovie.com.
[01:11:43.077 --> 01:11:44.418]  And again, I have no stake in the film.
[01:11:44.418 --> 01:11:46.720]  I'll probably sell it when it comes out on DVD.
[01:11:48.678 --> 01:11:52.421]  Along with God Is Not Dead and other great films that are really successful now.
[01:11:52.421 --> 01:12:03.028]  The reason I promote these is because, just like I had no stake in America, but they're trying to put him in prison for making it, so I have a stake in the First Amendment period.
[01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:06.411]  They were trying to lock somebody up for a film that I disagreed with.
[01:12:07.188 --> 01:12:08.909]  I would probably have them on.
[01:12:08.909 --> 01:12:11.029]  But I really think this book is excellent.
[01:12:11.029 --> 01:12:12.790]  Finally got a chance to read it and finish it.
[01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:14.010]  Can't wait to see the film.
[01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:17.391]  They sent me a raw copy of it, but I haven't had a chance to sit down and watch it yet.
[01:12:17.391 --> 01:12:19.312]  I will probably tonight or tomorrow.
[01:12:19.312 --> 01:12:23.593]  Neil, thank you so much for coming on and I'm sorry we rescheduled you a few weeks ago.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:28.062]  Well, I understand, Alex, breaking news has to take precedence.
[01:12:28.062 --> 01:12:29.623]  It is such a pleasure to be on with you.
[01:12:29.623 --> 01:12:31.564]  I am one of your subscribers.
[01:12:31.564 --> 01:12:32.424]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:12:32.424 --> 01:12:33.485]  Well, it's great to have you here.
[01:12:33.485 --> 01:12:42.029]  Tell folks that don't know about the book why it resonates with folks like Ron Paul and the author of Clockwork Orange and others that have been warning of dystopias.
[01:12:43.271 --> 01:12:59.322]  Well, Alex, not to put too fine a point on it and proudly to express the egoism that Ayn Rand would approve of, but when it comes to portraying the collapse of the United States due to statism, there's basically two stories.
[01:12:59.322 --> 01:13:01.883]  There's Atlas Shrugged and there's Alongside Night.
[01:13:01.883 --> 01:13:05.066]  Now, I had an advantage that Ayn Rand didn't have.
[01:13:05.066 --> 01:13:13.151]  She wasn't able to read Alongside Night before she wrote Atlas Shrugged, but I was able to read Atlas Shrugged before I wrote Alongside Night.
[01:13:15.915 --> 01:13:19.219]  People that read the book are blown away by many of the parallels that have come true.
[01:13:19.219 --> 01:13:23.886]  Break down the basic plot of the book for folks without giving away too much.
[01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:40.027]  I took historical examples, such as Weimar Germany in 1923, which created the seeds after World War I for German dissatisfaction and oppression, which led to Adolf Hitler having the opportunity to take over.
[01:13:40.027 --> 01:13:48.574]  I used historical precedents like that, and like Sinclair Lewis did in It Can't Happen Here, I applied it to the near future United States and what I came up with.
[01:13:49.054 --> 01:13:49.294]  Well,
[01:14:10.764 --> 01:14:12.606]  We're good to go.
[01:14:40.445 --> 01:14:40.725]  I think?
[01:15:05.293 --> 01:15:12.036]  The director in the novel of the FBI and updated in the movie to the director of FEMA have their own agenda.
[01:15:12.036 --> 01:15:28.483]  And so Dr. Vreeland and his family, including his 16-year-old son Elliot, basically find themselves on the run from the federal government as they attempt to get out of the country before an arrest warrant can put them in a secret FEMA prison.
[01:15:30.874 --> 01:15:47.521]  And now under NDAA, Eric Holder, the master kingpin of so many public criminal operations, says that Homeland Security is not for radical Islam, but it is for the Tea Party, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives.
[01:15:47.521 --> 01:15:57.925]  Why do you think we're seeing this shift publicly, it's so surreal I can't even believe it, but publicly onto anybody that likes George Washington as a terrorist?
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:07.963]  Well, for the same reason why the original tyrant of this continent, King George III, was not particularly fond of the Continental Congress.
[01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:13.645]  If you stand up for your rights, then you are not their pawns anymore, and you're a problem.
[01:16:15.273 --> 01:16:20.256]  Wow, I want to talk more about the film, but afterwards I want to get your view just on the world today.
[01:16:20.256 --> 01:16:23.758]  Again, we have Neil Schulman alongside NightMovie.com.
[01:16:23.758 --> 01:16:29.120]  But first off, tell folks where and when it's opening, how we can make sure that it's a big hit.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:38.946]  At first, for the folks that don't know, if the first cities where it's shown sell out for even a few days in a row, it will then get booked at other theaters, causing a chain reaction.
[01:16:40.154 --> 01:16:55.985]  Well, Alex, it is possible for anybody, including Alex Jones, to go to the Tug.com, and I'll use the radio code to spell that, that's Tango Uniform Golf Golf, Tug.com, and book a screening of Alongside Night anywhere in the United States.
[01:16:55.985 --> 01:17:01.709]  There are thousands of theaters which are already signed up under the Tug.com system, ready to put this movie out there.
[01:17:02.349 --> 01:17:15.363]  And so if you don't find a screening already in your own city, you book one, but you do have to do a little bit of marketing because you have to hit a minimum of somewhere between 60 and 70 or so tickets sold for the screening to be confirmed.
[01:17:15.363 --> 01:17:18.506]  However, if it's not confirmed, nobody gets charged, including the promoter.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:37.874]  The promoter gets 5% of the ticket sales, and it's essentially on-demand distribution from the grassroots, which is an ideal situation for an independent film like Alongside Night, which although it's being given a lot of attention, Kevin Sorbo was just on ABC's On the Red Carpet over the weekend.
[01:17:38.214 --> 01:17:41.438]  So we are breaking through to the mass market entertainment media.
[01:17:41.438 --> 01:17:45.082]  But nonetheless, Hollywood hasn't given us a distribution deal yet.
[01:17:45.082 --> 01:17:57.536]  And this is an ideal way to organize grassroots distribution while we're waiting for a traditional run like Kevin Sorbo's previous film, God's Not Dead, which in nine weeks did $61 million at the domestic box office.
[01:17:57.856 --> 01:18:02.918]  And then people say, well, why do I want to make, you know, the independent filmmakers $61 million?
[01:18:02.918 --> 01:18:14.181]  Because then they can make hit after hit promoting pro-freedom, pro-human messages, and we can literally overthrow Hollywood, the main globalist propaganda arm.
[01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:15.601]  This is how you win wars.
[01:18:15.601 --> 01:18:18.162]  90% of it is propaganda.
[01:18:18.162 --> 01:18:20.163]  And folks, propaganda is a neutral term.
[01:18:20.163 --> 01:18:21.663]  It has a negative connotation.
[01:18:21.663 --> 01:18:25.525]  But there's black propaganda, gray propaganda, and white propaganda.
[01:18:25.525 --> 01:18:26.905]  We put out white propaganda.
[01:18:27.205 --> 01:18:28.146]  Families are good.
[01:18:28.146 --> 01:18:29.627]  Private property is good.
[01:18:29.627 --> 01:18:31.049]  Self-defense is good.
[01:18:31.049 --> 01:18:32.110]  It's a win-win-win.
[01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:33.030]  You feel good at night.
[01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:34.512]  You have a great society.
[01:18:34.512 --> 01:18:35.873]  You don't screw people over.
[01:18:35.873 --> 01:18:41.358]  Black propaganda is lying to people, destroying them, dumbing them down, making them dependent.
[01:18:41.358 --> 01:18:41.898]  MSNBC.
[01:18:42.999 --> 01:18:48.324]  Being deceptive, manipulating, cheating people, making them think as groups, not individuals.
[01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:53.048]  Grey propaganda is just basically taking care of yourself at other people's expenses.
[01:18:53.048 --> 01:18:54.329]  Your take on that?
[01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:57.552]  I think the age of the kleptocrat is coming to an end.
[01:18:57.552 --> 01:19:02.276]  I believe that the waxing of corruption right now will be the beginning of their undoing.
[01:19:02.276 --> 01:19:03.257]  Look at all the statistics.
[01:19:04.891 --> 01:19:10.975]  Alex, you know, you do a job as an investigative journalist, which absolutely has to be done.
[01:19:10.975 --> 01:19:13.336]  I'm taking a slightly different approach.
[01:19:13.336 --> 01:19:25.803]  I'm saying I think that the system is already beyond the tipping point, and I think that we are already into a rebirth of the 1776 scenario of directly defending our rights against the government.
[01:19:27.009 --> 01:19:28.510]  I'm not advocating violence.
[01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:30.892]  I'm not advocating combating the government.
[01:19:30.892 --> 01:19:40.558]  I'm advocating using a jiu-jitsu approach of having their force miss us and being able to create a network of secure markets and secure networks.
[01:19:40.558 --> 01:19:41.299]  No, no, I agree.
[01:19:41.299 --> 01:19:42.419]  I agree.
[01:19:42.419 --> 01:19:46.102]  The kleptocratic left wants us to have a civil war with the police and military.
[01:19:46.582 --> 01:19:56.137]  We need to just be in for war with our dollars and our words, befriend them, and when they still attack us, just try to step out of the way, almost like judo.
[01:19:56.137 --> 01:19:56.898]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:56.898 --> 01:19:57.378]  Stay with us.

[01:20:29.051 --> 01:20:38.356]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:38.356 --> 01:20:39.136]  This capitalism?
[01:20:39.136 --> 01:20:45.319]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:45.319 --> 01:20:49.001]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:20:51.342 --> 01:20:51.662]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:58.686 --> 01:21:01.588]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[01:21:01.588 --> 01:21:05.130]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:07.292]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:21:07.292 --> 01:21:16.598]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:21:16.598 --> 01:21:22.582]  Plus, Big Berkey Water Filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:21:58.416 --> 01:22:01.238]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:01.238 --> 01:22:06.361]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.361 --> 01:22:14.487]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:14.487 --> 01:22:19.009]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:19.009 --> 01:22:22.812]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:28.916]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:32.078]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:32.078 --> 01:22:37.462]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:23:27.595 --> 01:23:28.695]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:23:28.695 --> 01:23:33.196]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:23:33.196 --> 01:23:38.897]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:23:38.897 --> 01:23:42.478]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:23:42.478 --> 01:23:45.158]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:45.158 --> 01:23:50.119]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:23:50.119 --> 01:23:50.359]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.719]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:09.404 --> 01:24:13.227]  And there's beer in Texarkana!
[01:24:36.789 --> 01:24:38.111]  I love the end of this song.
[01:24:38.111 --> 01:24:46.283]  Old Smokey's got his ears on, and he's out on your trail, and he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[01:24:46.283 --> 01:24:48.506]  So you got to dodge him, you got to duck him.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:59.065]  Going back to Neil Schulman, very interesting fella, alongside nightmovie.com.
[01:24:59.065 --> 01:25:01.667]  And again, I've heard about this group.
[01:25:01.667 --> 01:25:03.228]  I think it started in Austin a few years ago.
[01:25:03.228 --> 01:25:04.029]  It's become very popular.
[01:25:04.029 --> 01:25:08.553]  And it's really propelling a lot of independent films to huge success.
[01:25:08.553 --> 01:25:15.339]  A lot of liberty-based films where you go sign up that you do want to see at a theater in your area who's associated with it.
[01:25:16.697 --> 01:25:20.380]  And then if enough people do that, it comes and is shown there.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:27.404]  And I think you've only got to usually get about a quarter of the theater filled, and then that will pay to bring it to the theater.
[01:25:27.404 --> 01:25:29.285]  Very, very exciting.
[01:25:29.285 --> 01:25:37.991]  Neil, tell folks again how they can go to that website and sign up to see AlongsideNightMovie.com, and then if it doesn't show, their money's refunded.
[01:25:38.959 --> 01:25:39.159]  Right.
[01:25:39.159 --> 01:25:41.620]  Well, first of all, it doesn't cost a promoter any money to begin with.
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:43.581]  You don't have to put up any of your own money.
[01:25:43.581 --> 01:25:59.530]  But very frankly, if you go to AlongsideNightMovie.com, right on our website, we either have, you click through to find theaters or host a screening, and that'll put you right on the Tug.com website, either to buy a ticket for an existing screening or to host a screening of your own.
[01:26:00.637 --> 01:26:05.908]  Listen, let me emphasize, Alongside Night is not a documentary like Dinesh D'Souza is putting out.
[01:26:05.908 --> 01:26:09.015]  No offense to Dinesh D'Souza, he is the opposite number of Michael Moore.
[01:26:09.617 --> 01:26:09.917]  Amazing.
[01:26:09.917 --> 01:26:11.479]  Well, again, it's a key part of the info war.
[01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:39.492]  That these independent films get promoted out there.
[01:26:39.492 --> 01:26:42.634]  Looking at the larger picture, I mean, I agree with you.
[01:26:42.634 --> 01:26:46.716]  We're going into the endgame with these people because they're order out of chaos.
[01:26:46.716 --> 01:26:48.958]  They're more than happy to just wreck everything.
[01:26:50.927 --> 01:26:51.948]  They've already done it, Alex.
[01:26:51.948 --> 01:26:57.994]  In other words, we don't need to... Look, when The Long Sun first came out in 1979, it was considered science fiction.
[01:26:57.994 --> 01:27:09.627]  It's not science fiction anymore, because the conditions necessary for them to have totally violated the rights of the American people, and for us to realize that the Constitution, which was so carefully crafted,
[01:27:10.287 --> 01:27:11.248]  We're good to go.
[01:27:27.765 --> 01:27:36.191]  We have our rights, as stated eloquently in the Declaration of Independence, and we never give up those rights.
[01:27:36.191 --> 01:27:38.893]  It is not subject to the whim of the government.
[01:27:38.893 --> 01:27:41.394]  It is not subject to the whim of anybody.
[01:27:41.394 --> 01:27:42.955]  We stand up for those rights.
[01:27:42.955 --> 01:27:46.157]  We simply say, no, we will not be oppressed.
[01:27:46.157 --> 01:27:49.680]  We are Americans, and we remember, and we will never forget.
[01:27:51.684 --> 01:27:58.191]  We've got a couple minutes left before we go to break and I look forward to getting you back on the Nightly News soon to break down more of the film.
[01:27:58.191 --> 01:28:03.377]  But other points you'd like to address dealing with the film or just where our culture and society is going?
[01:28:05.449 --> 01:28:17.118]  Very frankly, we have already reached the tipping point where the government and the powers that wish to oppress us have already taken on more than they can chew.
[01:28:17.118 --> 01:28:22.021]  There is no point on the Laffer curve where taxation can support the government debt.
[01:28:22.021 --> 01:28:24.083]  It can't even service the debt.
[01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:32.349]  We are going to reach a point where the dollar is no longer going to be the reserve currency of other countries and they're not going to eat our debt anymore.
[01:28:32.809 --> 01:28:36.130]  When that happens, there's not going to be any money for welfare anymore.
[01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:41.692]  You can talk about whether or not welfare is going to be used for United States citizens or for foreigners.
[01:28:41.692 --> 01:28:44.313]  It doesn't matter when the checks bounce.
[01:28:44.313 --> 01:28:49.535]  And so what we need to do is we need to focus on a post-political situation.
[01:28:49.535 --> 01:28:53.477]  A situation in where the solutions come from the economic sector, not the political sector.
[01:28:54.077 --> 01:29:03.162]  Resilient markets, secure communication, secure transportation of goods and services in such a way that they can't stop our trade anymore.
[01:29:03.162 --> 01:29:12.026]  We build up secure markets, we build up our secure communications in such a way that we exercise our freedom and simply refuse to knuckle down.
[01:29:12.026 --> 01:29:12.486]  You know what?
[01:29:12.486 --> 01:29:14.707]  Can you do five more minutes with us on the other side?
[01:29:14.707 --> 01:29:16.849]  Because I want to talk about what you just said.
[01:29:16.849 --> 01:29:17.909]  It's so key.
[01:29:17.909 --> 01:29:19.250]  Everything the globalists do
[01:29:20.407 --> 01:29:23.585]  The global collectivist who exempt themselves from their own collectivism.
[01:29:24.517 --> 01:29:27.179]  They live above it but skim off the top.
[01:29:27.179 --> 01:29:29.780]  Use collectivism to dumb us down and domesticate us.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:35.124]  Everything they do is about making us dependent, making us not have our own systems.
[01:29:35.124 --> 01:29:37.926]  The great crime is to be Amish or to have a lemonade stand.
[01:29:37.926 --> 01:29:40.347]  The great crime is to have your own machine shop.
[01:29:40.347 --> 01:29:46.091]  That's where they send the zoners and the bureaucrats to shut you down.
[01:29:46.091 --> 01:29:47.272]  You're absolutely right.
[01:29:47.272 --> 01:29:48.733]  We must become independent.
[01:29:48.733 --> 01:29:49.073]  That's the key.
[01:29:49.073 --> 01:29:50.174]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.174 --> 01:29:51.675]  The empire is on the run.
[01:29:52.675 --> 01:29:59.823]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.823 --> 01:30:02.626]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:02.626 --> 01:30:07.290]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:09.332]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[01:30:14.718 --> 01:30:14.878]  We're
[01:30:35.572 --> 01:30:42.534]  Months free, right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[01:30:42.534 --> 01:30:46.415]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[01:30:46.415 --> 01:30:53.037]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[01:30:53.037 --> 01:30:58.099]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[01:30:59.656 --> 01:31:05.804]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:31:05.804 --> 01:31:09.088]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:31:09.088 --> 01:31:09.990]  Here we go, folks!
[01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.891]  I'm being assaulted!
[01:31:10.891 --> 01:31:17.059]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:17.219 --> 01:31:23.282]  Is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:31:23.282 --> 01:31:27.244]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:31:27.244 --> 01:31:30.325]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:31:30.325 --> 01:31:38.589]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:31:38.589 --> 01:31:40.690]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:31:40.690 --> 01:31:41.731]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:31:42.111 --> 01:31:51.063]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[01:31:51.063 --> 01:31:53.707]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[01:31:59.611 --> 01:32:01.834]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:32:01.834 --> 01:32:09.903]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:09.903 --> 01:32:17.012]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:32:17.412 --> 01:32:22.036]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:32:22.036 --> 01:32:32.665]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:32:32.665 --> 01:32:39.150]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:32:39.150 --> 01:32:41.492]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:32:41.492 --> 01:32:45.355]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:32:45.515 --> 01:32:47.457]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:32:47.457 --> 01:32:51.641]  All the products at InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[01:32:51.641 --> 01:32:58.588]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[01:33:00.009 --> 01:33:14.680]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:23.407]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[01:33:23.407 --> 01:33:24.348]  That's Aldous Huxley, by the way.
[01:33:24.348 --> 01:33:26.329]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:33:26.329 --> 01:33:26.770]  Well, we did.
[01:33:28.523 --> 01:33:40.526]  We're being bred like cattle.
[01:33:40.526 --> 01:33:43.707]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[01:33:43.707 --> 01:33:46.027]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[01:33:46.027 --> 01:33:48.488]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:57.012]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[01:33:57.012 --> 01:34:03.875]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:34:03.875 --> 01:34:04.115]  See?
[01:34:04.115 --> 01:34:04.655]  Mercury's good, kids.
[01:34:04.655 --> 01:34:08.917]  Water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[01:34:08.917 --> 01:34:11.859]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[01:34:11.859 --> 01:34:16.120]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.102]  We're gonna have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[01:34:20.425 --> 01:34:24.508]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[01:34:24.508 --> 01:34:25.749]  Well, join me.
[01:34:25.749 --> 01:34:28.110]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[01:34:28.110 --> 01:34:31.493]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:34:31.493 --> 01:34:41.759]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:47.463]  That's Henry Kissinger, by the way.
[01:34:47.463 --> 01:34:48.244]  If I say that
[01:34:52.745 --> 01:34:53.965]  The globalists are tyrants.
[01:34:53.965 --> 01:34:55.586]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:34:55.586 --> 01:35:00.607]  If I say mercury attacks your brain cells like no other heavy metal, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:35:00.607 --> 01:35:12.310]  If I say Harvard, in its own study of 24 other studies, says that fluoride in the water reduces your IQ by at least 10 points, 7-fold increase in bone cancer, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:14.131]  Doesn't matter, those are all absolute facts.
[01:35:14.571 --> 01:35:21.176]  It doesn't matter if two Americans have now gotten Ebola in Africa and it's one plane ride away, the CDC says.
[01:35:21.176 --> 01:35:23.558]  Huge Ebola outbreaks all over Western Africa.
[01:35:23.558 --> 01:35:26.760]  It's just no big deal.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.821]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:35:27.821 --> 01:35:33.665]  If I say our government publicly funded ISIS and Al-Qaeda to turn them loose worldwide, it doesn't matter if it's a fact.
[01:35:33.665 --> 01:35:34.606]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:35:36.127 --> 01:35:53.415]  If I say that DrugsReport.com on the right hand side is linked to that article that Adon Salazar just published 20 minutes ago, and that is that the illegals are to be given preferential treatment during hurricanes for evacuation out of the country.
[01:35:55.998 --> 01:36:02.903]  A professor's come out and said that guest worker program is freezing Americans out of the middle class.
[01:36:02.903 --> 01:36:05.044]  That's USA Today.
[01:36:05.044 --> 01:36:09.788]  Death train to increase traveling speeds to deter jumping on board.
[01:36:09.788 --> 01:36:16.593]  In the event of emergency, illegals to be evacuated before citizens.
[01:36:16.593 --> 01:36:17.974]  And we reported on this a while back.
[01:36:17.974 --> 01:36:19.094]  Now it's at Mainstream News.
[01:36:19.094 --> 01:36:22.457]  Border Patrol points loaded gun at Iowa Boy Scouts troop.
[01:36:26.147 --> 01:36:28.711]  on the northern border.
[01:36:28.711 --> 01:36:36.361]  Plan is to get unaccompanied women and children to safer ground.
[01:36:36.361 --> 01:36:37.422]  End of Christianity.
[01:36:37.422 --> 01:36:43.070]  Bishop warns ISIS could wipe out Christians in the Middle East.
[01:36:45.259 --> 01:36:47.780]  Drive the Nazarenes into the desert.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:50.480]  Well, that's the plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:53.661]  I want to take your phone calls after we finish up with our guest here in a moment.
[01:36:53.661 --> 01:36:57.762]  The toll-free number to join us to discuss all of this designed chaos is 800-259-9231.
[01:36:57.762 --> 01:36:57.802]  800-259-9231.
[01:37:06.255 --> 01:37:10.597]  Again, 800-259-9231 on this Live Monday edition.
[01:37:10.597 --> 01:37:21.142]  But I wanted to ask our guest, who's on with us, Neil Shulman, a best-selling author, researcher, alongside NightMovie.com that Ron Paul and Kevin Sorbo and others are in.
[01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:24.052]  That you can help make a success.
[01:37:24.052 --> 01:37:31.921]  I wanted to ask him though, I mean, he hits on building our own economic systems, becoming self-sufficient as the collapse comes into view.
[01:37:31.921 --> 01:37:41.211]  Ron Paul's talked about blaming the globalists for the collapse so they don't blame what's left of real capitalism for crony capitalism when that goes down.
[01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:42.212]  I think that's key as well.
[01:37:43.311 --> 01:38:02.823]  But also, reaching out to people in the system so they understand the big picture, exposing the globalists as wanting to ride this collapse that they helped engineer, but also becoming somewhat self-sufficient, or even thinking about being self-sufficient, will then move us in the right direction.
[01:38:02.823 --> 01:38:07.246]  I totally agree with you, because you can see the system, as I said before we went to break,
[01:38:09.423 --> 01:38:18.185]  They do everything they can to make us dependent and to make us basically be like domesticated jellyfish.
[01:38:18.185 --> 01:38:20.365]  Why do you think that is, Neil?
[01:38:20.365 --> 01:38:21.546]  I mean, I agree with you.
[01:38:21.546 --> 01:38:23.346]  Obviously, that's their weak point.
[01:38:23.346 --> 01:38:32.248]  They're worried about libertarians and patriots who understand what freedom's about, just like cancer worries about being cut out of the body by the scalpel.
[01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:37.172]  If it had a consciousness, and they're worried about self-sufficiency.
[01:38:37.172 --> 01:38:43.555]  So I think if you look at how they're arrayed to stop us, you see the answer to defeat them right there.
[01:38:43.555 --> 01:38:48.258]  Look, in Star Wars, what leads to the destruction of the Empire?
[01:38:48.258 --> 01:38:56.262]  It's their hubris, it's their belief that the Death Star is actually more powerful than the Rebel Alliance.
[01:38:56.262 --> 01:38:59.644]  We have the tradition of freedom.
[01:39:00.330 --> 01:39:07.711]  They are counting from centuries of public education, from control of the mass media, from control of the culture.
[01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:11.212]  They think that they can make us forget who we are.
[01:39:11.212 --> 01:39:12.272]  They can't.
[01:39:12.272 --> 01:39:13.392]  We won't forget.
[01:39:13.392 --> 01:39:14.753]  We will never forget.
[01:39:14.753 --> 01:39:17.253]  I also need to point out something else, Alex.
[01:39:17.253 --> 01:39:19.233]  You're always trying to unearth secrets.
[01:39:19.233 --> 01:39:20.474]  You're looking for the whistleblowers.
[01:39:20.474 --> 01:39:24.414]  You're trying to find out what the enemy is doing in secret.
[01:39:24.414 --> 01:39:25.754]  That's great work.
[01:39:25.754 --> 01:39:28.535]  But what they do out in the open, what they brag
[01:39:30.184 --> 01:39:35.928]  What they consider their triumphs is perfectly sufficient for us to recognize them for what they are.
[01:39:35.928 --> 01:39:45.093]  We don't need to look at the curtain to know that there is no wizard there.
[01:39:45.093 --> 01:39:45.894]  Very profound.
[01:39:45.894 --> 01:39:47.135]  No, no, I agree with you.
[01:39:47.135 --> 01:39:52.918]  And so much of what is out in the open, because you're informed, is not out in the open to the public.
[01:39:52.918 --> 01:39:57.481]  Still, maybe 30% of the public in polls thinks hydrofluorosilic acid is good for them.
[01:39:58.203 --> 01:40:00.964]  And then I say to them, well then why are they forcibly putting it in?
[01:40:00.964 --> 01:40:02.484]  Why don't you just take it?
[01:40:02.484 --> 01:40:11.966]  Forced medication is against the law, federally at the state level and under the Geneva Convention, and they just laugh at me and just move on with their ignorance.
[01:40:11.966 --> 01:40:19.588]  So I don't even so much cover what's secret, I do some of that, but what is public but hidden in plain view.
[01:40:19.588 --> 01:40:20.448]  That's exactly right.
[01:40:22.734 --> 01:40:24.916]  We need to just remember who we are.
[01:40:24.916 --> 01:40:27.599]  We need to remember what our basic principles are.
[01:40:27.599 --> 01:40:44.216]  And if we act according to the principles that we were founded on as a nation, as a country, not as a state, not even as a federation of states, because that's a political construction which is a temporary device to try to restrain them.
[01:40:45.717 --> 01:40:52.883]  It's the culture of America, the ideals that were never truly realized that threatened the dragons of the New World Order.
[01:40:52.883 --> 01:40:56.686]  It's not that the state of America was ever that good or special.
[01:40:56.686 --> 01:41:03.812]  It's just compared to the other slag heaps, it was a little bit better, so prosperity had a better chance here and became the model of the world.
[01:41:03.812 --> 01:41:10.297]  But then the parasites flocked here, like locusts to a cornfield, because that's where prosperity had been created.
[01:41:10.297 --> 01:41:12.299]  Now we've entered into this decadent trough
[01:41:13.039 --> 01:41:14.200]  Bottom trough, hopefully.
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:18.524]  Hopefully it's the end of this deepening decadence.
[01:41:18.524 --> 01:41:27.712]  So I get what you're saying, but the construct of our republic is certainly better than the North American Union or the United Nations.
[01:41:27.712 --> 01:41:31.115]  So many libertarians are just ready to let it all collapse.
[01:41:31.115 --> 01:41:37.500]  My issue is, we are collapsing into a greater form of evil government.
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:38.201]  What do you say to that?
[01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:48.011]  I say that that has been an ongoing process for a long time and that's why we need to focus on solutions.
[01:41:48.011 --> 01:41:50.334]  We need to be solution-oriented.
[01:41:50.334 --> 01:41:55.780]  You're solution-oriented in a lot of ways with a lot of your products that you talk about.
[01:41:57.094 --> 01:42:04.218]  We need to be solution-oriented in terms of power, in terms of communication, in terms of transportation.
[01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:08.721]  We need to basic... Look, I've said it before as a joke, but it's partially true.
[01:42:08.721 --> 01:42:14.945]  If the Declaration of Independence were written today, it would read like a 12-step program, as we wean ourselves away from government.
[01:42:14.945 --> 01:42:20.328]  But the point is, we are reaching a crisis point where the system is going to collapse upon itself.
[01:42:20.328 --> 01:42:21.949]  We don't need to seek out a revolution.
[01:42:21.949 --> 01:42:26.112]  They are bringing on a revolution, and it's simply a matter of when the music stops.
[01:42:26.252 --> 01:42:26.672]  I agree.
[01:42:26.672 --> 01:42:28.253]  Who is going to have a chair left?
[01:42:28.253 --> 01:42:29.554]  Who is going to have a chair left?
[01:42:29.554 --> 01:42:33.977]  And I say it needs to be, we liberty seekers are not eliminated by them.
[01:42:33.977 --> 01:42:42.303]  But they think the collapse is going to bring in their volholic, utopian, socialist, technocratic construct.
[01:42:42.303 --> 01:42:43.744]  There's no way it's going to work.
[01:42:43.744 --> 01:42:46.746]  It's going to be an unbelievable, unmitigated disaster.
[01:42:46.746 --> 01:42:51.569]  I mean, do you think they have a method of their madness at the technocratic level?
[01:42:53.623 --> 01:42:59.585]  Again, going back to Star Wars, the more they tighten their grip, the more the system will slip through their fingers.
[01:42:59.585 --> 01:43:04.246]  The balance to every controlled economy is a counter-economy.
[01:43:04.246 --> 01:43:05.887]  We are the counter-economy.
[01:43:05.887 --> 01:43:16.770]  We will build the economy so that it becomes the economy, and we do that by making our business resilient and immune to their attacks.
[01:43:16.770 --> 01:43:18.890]  What does your gut tell you, Neil?
[01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:20.131]  What does your gut tell you?
[01:43:20.131 --> 01:43:20.911]  How is this going to end?
[01:43:22.498 --> 01:43:27.603]  I think it's going to end in triumph because we have history on our side, we have economics on our side.
[01:43:27.603 --> 01:43:32.307]  Their economics is based on a lie that you can create something out of nothing.
[01:43:32.307 --> 01:43:39.714]  Our economics is based on a truth that the people who produce things are the crucial
[01:43:42.005 --> 01:43:46.587]  The crucial base to our security and our freedom.
[01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:52.330]  They think that we will be fooled, that we will accept them as our paternalistic nanny state.
[01:43:52.330 --> 01:43:55.552]  That's a bit of a contradiction, but I think it covers both ends of it.
[01:43:55.552 --> 01:43:56.613]  We're not going to.
[01:43:56.613 --> 01:44:02.896]  That's not the base of principles that our freedom was founded on, that our prosperity was founded on.
[01:44:02.896 --> 01:44:09.260]  We simply need to remember who we are and say, no, you are not my master.
[01:44:12.264 --> 01:44:20.771]  Well, I agree with that statement, and we have to just respond to the mind control by pointing out what an unmitigated fraud it is.
[01:44:20.771 --> 01:44:23.693]  Again, the movie is AlongsideNightMovie.com.
[01:44:23.693 --> 01:44:25.174]  Folks can find out the details there.
[01:44:25.174 --> 01:44:27.436]  Neil Schulman, thank you so much for the time.
[01:44:27.436 --> 01:44:28.496]  It has been a pleasure.
[01:44:28.496 --> 01:44:29.898]  Been a pleasure having you.
[01:44:29.898 --> 01:44:32.820]  I want to go to your phone calls now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:40.990]  And then I'll get into the other news on the Middle East, North Korea threatening to nuke the White House.
[01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:48.155]  That's just more fear-mongering by another mentally ill statist, Kim Jong-un.
[01:44:48.155 --> 01:44:53.539]  I will also get into mass incarceration.
[01:44:53.539 --> 01:44:58.323]  21 amazing facts about America's obsession with prison.
[01:44:58.323 --> 01:45:00.704]  There's a lot of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:45:01.673 --> 01:45:08.338]  Multiple reports, Ukrainian fighter jets were with Malaysian Flight 17 when it was shot down.
[01:45:08.338 --> 01:45:09.779]  That's now being confirmed.
[01:45:09.779 --> 01:45:16.904]  I just can't believe how brazen the globalists are, but I guess I can and I do.
[01:45:16.904 --> 01:45:24.310]  Before we go to your phone calls, I wanted to play part of the newscast from KRGV News.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:33.485]  And just to point out, our veterans are having healthcare taken away, confirmed, to give it to the illegal aliens.
[01:45:33.485 --> 01:45:38.909]  So understand, in this system, they want to swamp it and collapse it to bring in total control.
[01:45:38.909 --> 01:45:48.455]  All of you out there that want your government handouts and want people to vote for more government handouts so you're for the illegals, you're going to end up getting neither because you went along with this.
[01:45:48.455 --> 01:45:53.679]  And again, I'm not demonizing the poor people of Latin America who live in living hell.
[01:45:55.146 --> 01:45:57.948]  In general, but a lot of them are MS-13 and other gangs.
[01:45:57.948 --> 01:46:00.389]  That's come out in the news.
[01:46:00.389 --> 01:46:10.995]  And I saw police driving home from East Texas yesterday, pulling over Hispanic, white and black, for some reason, housewives with their kids.
[01:46:10.995 --> 01:46:15.317]  And a couple of times I was in Belmi driving into Waco.
[01:46:15.317 --> 01:46:18.139]  I saw a guy in a big black SUV with a well-dressed
[01:46:19.918 --> 01:46:30.445]  Church lady, it looked like, with like a five-year-old and a three-year-old standing out in the 110 degree heat while he was searching their vehicle.
[01:46:30.445 --> 01:46:40.953]  And just the image of that paramilitary officer and this woman and her kids being searched, I almost pulled over and started videotaping, knowing he'd run over and say, you can't videotape.
[01:46:40.953 --> 01:46:43.875]  And then I could say, how dare you be a police state thug?
[01:46:43.875 --> 01:46:45.076]  But I wanted to throw up.
[01:46:46.377 --> 01:46:55.143]  While the border is wide open, the TSA is on record in articles again this week, video, just waving illegals through, no ID.
[01:46:55.143 --> 01:46:57.485]  And I've seen it before!
[01:46:57.485 --> 01:47:09.333]  The illegals, you know, are obviously illegals, got the cowboy hats, whole nine yards, cowboy boots, whole nine yards, and they say, don't speak English, have no paperwork.
[01:47:09.333 --> 01:47:12.795]  They sit there in Spanish and they just wave them through.
[01:47:12.795 --> 01:47:15.257]  The whole police state is for us the milk cows.
[01:47:17.085 --> 01:47:23.189]  We're the target of all of this, and it's total discrimination.
[01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:27.993]  They just want new people to get in here to overthrow the political system.
[01:47:27.993 --> 01:47:33.557]  And if America is so pathetic and so domesticated and we don't stand up to this, we get what we deserve.
[01:47:33.557 --> 01:47:42.303]  And down the road, I will just leave the country, which will only put off the inevitable collapse of wherever I go next, because there's not many places to go.
[01:47:42.303 --> 01:47:44.085]  Picture countries as like islands.
[01:47:45.089 --> 01:47:48.891]  Above seas of oppression, poverty, and tyranny.
[01:47:48.891 --> 01:47:55.375]  And as the ocean rises, even though they may sound like a conspiracy theorist, the islands are actually the tips of mountains.
[01:47:55.375 --> 01:47:58.417]  They're not floating, like the congressman from Georgia says.
[01:47:58.417 --> 01:48:01.178]  Now he would just call me a conspiracy theorist and say they are floating.
[01:48:01.178 --> 01:48:02.099]  They're not.
[01:48:02.099 --> 01:48:06.861]  I know that's a conspiracy for me to have my own view, grounded in science, and to make my own decision.
[01:48:06.861 --> 01:48:09.323]  If MSNBC doesn't say it's the tip of a mountain,
[01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:13.805]  That the Hawaiian chain is mountaintops above the Pacific Ocean.
[01:48:13.805 --> 01:48:14.265]  It isn't.
[01:48:14.265 --> 01:48:17.786]  They're floating, according to Democratic congressmen and others.
[01:48:17.786 --> 01:48:21.088]  But I'm going to be a conspiracy theorist and tell you they're mountaintops.
[01:48:21.088 --> 01:48:25.510]  And as the ocean goes up, more countries go underwater.
[01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:27.431]  And the United States has rising water.
[01:48:27.431 --> 01:48:29.332]  There's Switzerland.
[01:48:29.332 --> 01:48:30.072]  There's New Zealand.
[01:48:31.513 --> 01:48:36.997]  There's Chile, there's places like Luxembourg or Monte Carlo if you're filthy rich.
[01:48:36.997 --> 01:48:39.239]  And those places will be safe to the very end.
[01:48:39.239 --> 01:48:41.260]  Places like Monte Carlo.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.521]  Places like Luxembourg.
[01:48:42.521 --> 01:48:46.044]  But folks, if you don't have $50 million, you can't retire to Luxembourg.
[01:48:46.044 --> 01:48:47.645]  I've looked it up.
[01:48:47.645 --> 01:48:54.470]  If you don't have $4 or $5 million, you can't try to even get into Switzerland.
[01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:57.833]  There are a few dozen countries that are a little bit better off than the U.S., but the water's rising.
[01:48:58.536 --> 01:48:59.516]  Is my point.
[01:48:59.516 --> 01:49:04.918]  So here is that newscast in the event of emergency illegals to be evacuated before citizens.
[01:49:04.918 --> 01:49:11.900]  The headlines up on InfoWars.com and it was hidden in a KRGV newscast that we've highlighted.
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.581]  It's also on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:49:13.581 --> 01:49:13.921]  Here it is.
[01:49:15.566 --> 01:49:19.331]  When a hurricane strikes, getting folks to safety is very important.
[01:49:19.331 --> 01:49:26.220]  Emergency managers in McAllen are concerned that with the number of illegal crossers in the valley, that task just got harder.
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:32.047]  How will they move up to 4,000 unaccompanied women and children to safety?
[01:49:32.047 --> 01:49:33.790]  The questions don't stop there.
[01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:40.454]  You have extra sheltering areas right now, detention centers, and are they able to withstand the wind?
[01:49:40.454 --> 01:49:45.678]  Are they able to withstand floodwaters nearby to get humanitarian relief in there?
[01:49:45.678 --> 01:49:52.342]  All these questions come with the responsibility of keeping these illegal crossers safe in the event of hurricane hits.
[01:49:52.342 --> 01:49:58.166]  City officials along with multiple emergency managers Valley-wide came together to analyze the numbers.
[01:49:58.166 --> 01:49:59.867]  The Valley's population exceeds 1.3
[01:50:01.048 --> 01:50:03.150]  3 million people, according to the U.S.
[01:50:03.150 --> 01:50:04.431]  Census Bureau.
[01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:07.353]  Add to that another 4,000 people here illegally.
[01:50:07.353 --> 01:50:11.015]  A meeting this week in McAllen set a plan in motion.
[01:50:11.015 --> 01:50:16.159]  The entire valley of detention areas will be evacuated first.
[01:50:16.159 --> 01:50:25.226]  In other words, before the public gets their mandatory evacuations, the plan is to get all these unaccompanied women and children out of the valley to safer ground.
[01:50:25.686 --> 01:50:28.610]  Ensuring the illegal crossers don't go astray.
[01:50:28.610 --> 01:50:32.435]  Preventing losing track of them during hectic times.
[01:50:32.435 --> 01:50:35.539]  Where they will be evacuated was kept private.
[01:50:35.539 --> 01:50:38.723]  Protesters threatening the safety of these people.
[01:50:38.723 --> 01:50:43.889]  They use this to bring in a crisis in the border regions, federalize the states, create more of these FEMA camps.
[01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:53.737]  And we know, they give them the Democratic Party operatives, Democratic Party churches, faith-based initiative, paid-off, state-run churches, and they become the new political football class.
[01:50:53.737 --> 01:50:55.258]  And we'll be right back with your phone calls.
[01:50:55.258 --> 01:50:55.918]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:52:58.567 --> 01:53:02.549]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[01:53:02.549 --> 01:53:05.790]  I'm sure you know, this economy sucks!
[01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:11.692]  We all realize that the American economy is tremendously unstable right now and will likely get much worse.
[01:53:11.692 --> 01:53:20.556]  There's monumental debt, government bailouts, stock and real estate bubbles that are primed to pop at any moment which can flush away most or all of your retirement savings.
[01:53:20.856 --> 01:53:23.738]  This type of movement has enormous consequences.
[01:53:23.738 --> 01:53:29.162]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[01:53:29.162 --> 01:53:32.024]  Financial trouble is right here at our doorstep.
[01:53:32.024 --> 01:53:38.128]  But if you move right now and develop a backup plan immediately, this could be the most profitable time of your life.
[01:53:38.128 --> 01:53:43.372]  Proportionally, more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in our history.

[01:56:08.491 --> 01:56:13.198]  The Pro Liberty Golf shirts, all of it, at MadeIn1776.com or InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:19.648 --> 01:56:25.450]  And again, we don't fund our operation with a gun to your head like MSNBC that gets taxpayer money through stimulus.
[01:56:25.450 --> 01:56:30.212]  We do it by selling high-quality products at good prices, and we help you shop with the good guys.
[01:56:30.212 --> 01:56:32.892]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carl in Washington.
[01:56:32.892 --> 01:56:33.973]  Thanks for calling.
[01:56:33.973 --> 01:56:35.753]  Go ahead.
[01:56:35.753 --> 01:56:46.177]  Hey Alex, I had a question, one hopefully you can answer, and that's, you know, Congress and Senate's getting ready to go on break here, and... We got about a minute and a half, sir.
[01:56:46.177 --> 01:56:46.477]  Go ahead.
[01:56:48.038 --> 01:56:48.498]  Are you there?
[01:56:48.498 --> 01:56:50.078]  Yeah, I'm going to have to let you go.
[01:56:50.078 --> 01:56:50.919]  Might have a phone problem.
[01:56:50.919 --> 01:56:52.159]  Sorry, Carl.
[01:56:52.159 --> 01:56:53.359]  Matthew in Michigan.
[01:56:53.359 --> 01:56:54.219]  Matthew in Michigan.
[01:56:54.219 --> 01:56:55.159]  You're on the air.
[01:56:55.159 --> 01:56:56.419]  Go ahead.
[01:56:56.419 --> 01:56:57.840]  Yeah, it's an honor to talk to you today, Alex.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:58.840]  You're doing a great job.
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:03.361]  And I've been a Prison Planet member, subscriber, since the beginning.
[01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:05.361]  First time caller, and you woke me up in 2006.
[01:57:05.361 --> 01:57:07.041]  Thank you, brother.
[01:57:07.041 --> 01:57:16.543]  I just want to say that I get really irritated when I try to talk to family members and friends, and I try to bring up these important topics, and they just totally go to that, you know, tinfoil hat, conspiracy theorist.
[01:57:17.162 --> 01:57:22.024]  And I'll be like, well, you know, this happened, you know, USS Liberty got attacked, you know, a long time ago.
[01:57:22.024 --> 01:57:27.586]  I'll try to bring up specific points and stuff about that the globalists are trying to do, and they just, oh, that doesn't happen.
[01:57:27.586 --> 01:57:28.326]  Or they wouldn't even look at that.
[01:57:28.326 --> 01:57:39.431]  Well, what they're really saying is, I feel like I don't have any power, so I'm just going to deny things, and this is my cop-out to just go through life and not really exist and just be programmed by the false culture.
[01:57:39.431 --> 01:57:41.552]  They have no culture, so they're victims.
[01:57:41.552 --> 01:57:43.012]  You can't be angry at them.
[01:57:43.012 --> 01:57:44.613]  There are ways to deprogram them.
[01:57:44.613 --> 01:57:44.913]  Go ahead.
[01:57:45.805 --> 01:57:52.768]  No, I don't get angry, I just get really frustrated and to me sometimes I don't know what I can do.
[01:57:52.768 --> 01:57:56.550]  I just started my own domain name and I want to start making my own videos.
[01:57:56.550 --> 01:58:03.353]  My big thing is the fluoride in the water and the fact that the sun plays with our weather patterns and everybody likes to blame global warming.
[01:58:03.353 --> 01:58:06.935]  Al Gore's not a fear monger, he wants to take our money, but oh my god, Al Jones!
[01:58:07.775 --> 01:58:12.118]  You've taken your step into a giant world, Matthew, and don't thank me.
[01:58:12.118 --> 01:58:16.820]  Anybody will tell you, any salesman will tell you, selling your family is next to impossible.
[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:24.064]  A lot of times, only the very best families get listening to your family instead of putting your family down.
[01:58:24.064 --> 01:58:28.306]  So they feel powerful when they reject you, powerful when they laugh at you.
[01:58:28.306 --> 01:58:31.468]  So go off, be successful on your own, warning others.
[01:58:32.188 --> 01:58:33.809]  And then they'll respect you down the road.
[01:58:33.809 --> 01:58:36.329]  And they'll remember that you warned them earlier.
[01:58:36.329 --> 01:58:38.170]  So I salute you, Matthew.
[01:58:38.170 --> 01:58:38.650]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.650 --> 01:58:39.870]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:43.811]  We'll go to Tomahawk, Michael, Lab Rat, John and others.
[01:58:43.811 --> 01:58:44.872]  Straight ahead.
[01:58:44.872 --> 01:58:45.832]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:45.832 --> 01:58:48.193]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:48.193 --> 01:58:48.833]  Jamming it in.
[01:58:49.853 --> 01:58:56.015]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:58:56.015 --> 01:59:00.577]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:59:00.577 --> 01:59:05.139]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:59:05.539 --> 01:59:08.480]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:13.901]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:59:13.901 --> 01:59:21.303]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:59:21.303 --> 01:59:25.445]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:59:25.445 --> 01:59:30.206]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:30.546 --> 01:59:39.033]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:59:39.033 --> 01:59:43.436]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:59:43.436 --> 01:59:52.544]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:59:52.544 --> 01:59:54.925]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.925 --> 01:59:57.708]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.526 --> 02:00:10.367]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.367 --> 02:00:11.947]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.947 --> 02:00:13.508]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.508 --> 02:00:17.689]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.689 --> 02:00:21.769]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:35.213]  At 20 after, William Gein, the head of Alipac, they're kind of like gun owners in America, but for the borders.
[02:00:35.213 --> 02:00:36.334]  They're up there on Capitol Hill.
[02:00:36.334 --> 02:00:40.697]  They'll give us the inside baseball on what's really going on with the collapse of the border.
[02:00:40.697 --> 02:00:42.078]  It's so important.
[02:00:42.078 --> 02:00:49.983]  I've got a red siren imitating Drudge in here right now in the TV studio that will only come out during the most dire of emergencies.
[02:00:49.983 --> 02:00:51.184]  But it's out with us here today.
[02:00:52.947 --> 02:01:00.032]  Let's go to Tomahawk, and then Michael, then after the break we'll go to Lab Rat, John, Phyllis, and many others.
[02:01:00.032 --> 02:01:05.317]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:01:05.317 --> 02:01:09.180]  Tomahawk is calling in from FEMA Region 4.
[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:10.701]  Now people see how serious it is.
[02:01:10.701 --> 02:01:12.082]  They just do what they want under U.N.
[02:01:12.082 --> 02:01:13.042]  control.
[02:01:13.042 --> 02:01:13.563]  The U.N.
[02:01:13.563 --> 02:01:16.085]  is basically running the open border operation.
[02:01:16.085 --> 02:01:17.266]  That's now confirmed.
[02:01:17.266 --> 02:01:20.909]  What former state are you in, Tomahawk?
[02:01:20.909 --> 02:01:22.550]  Home of the Georgia Guidestones.
[02:01:23.052 --> 02:01:26.974]  So you're in Georgia, former Georgia peach territory.
[02:01:26.974 --> 02:01:27.814]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:27.814 --> 02:01:31.776]  Um, yeah, I just had a couple of things, you know, encouraging and discouraging.
[02:01:31.776 --> 02:01:36.418]  I'll have to say the discouraging thing would be you talking about leaving the nation.
[02:01:36.418 --> 02:01:44.402]  I know that it's getting so crazy here that you feel for your family and, uh, and I just, you know, probably see too many ways out.
[02:01:44.402 --> 02:01:50.705]  But the most encouraging thing I see is whenever you put a bull horn in your hand and you go screaming and ranting,
[02:01:51.149 --> 02:01:52.289]  And telling people what it is.
[02:01:52.289 --> 02:01:53.690]  And you're going to have a following.
[02:01:53.690 --> 02:01:55.370]  I mean, you want to be William Wallace?
[02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:55.951]  There you go.
[02:01:55.951 --> 02:01:56.791]  They're going to come.
[02:01:56.791 --> 02:01:58.051]  You build it, they will come.
[02:01:58.051 --> 02:01:59.212]  And I will come.
[02:01:59.212 --> 02:02:03.293]  From all the way from Georgia to help you and your family support the border.
[02:02:03.293 --> 02:02:04.913]  I mean, you know, securing it.
[02:02:04.913 --> 02:02:07.674]  And, I mean, we're up against a tyrannical government.
[02:02:07.674 --> 02:02:12.256]  Well, that's why they've got Rick Perry playing the part of, I'll put a thousand troops on the border!
[02:02:12.256 --> 02:02:16.017]  And then you read the fine print to deliver them to ICE to ship them into the country.
[02:02:16.789 --> 02:02:19.116]  And then even listeners go, but I wanna believe in Perry!
[02:02:19.116 --> 02:02:20.119]  I'm sorry!
[02:02:20.119 --> 02:02:21.042]  It's a fraud!
[02:02:21.042 --> 02:02:22.205]  It's a hoax!
[02:02:22.205 --> 02:02:23.308]  I'm not gonna lie to people!
[02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:29.954]  And you got Jesse Ventura talking about supporting open borders while he lives in Mexico.
[02:02:29.954 --> 02:02:30.895]  I mean, it's just a hoax.
[02:02:30.895 --> 02:02:34.879]  The left wing, the right wing, it's all a joke.
[02:02:34.879 --> 02:02:35.900]  Well, Sharon, I want to be clear.
[02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:37.761]  Jesse is a total libertarian.
[02:02:37.761 --> 02:02:39.523]  He says, total guns.
[02:02:39.523 --> 02:02:41.965]  He says, legalize everything.
[02:02:41.965 --> 02:02:43.947]  We shouldn't have borders.
[02:02:43.947 --> 02:02:46.549]  But you can't have socialism and welfare.
[02:02:46.549 --> 02:02:50.852]  I mean, you wouldn't have all these people coming up here if there wasn't welfare.
[02:02:50.852 --> 02:02:52.234]  Or the ones that came up would want to work.
[02:02:53.652 --> 02:03:05.074]  We allow the whole world, if you're a criminal, you run New America now, and get signed up with an ACORN group, and then the Democrats put the word in at ICE, and you have a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[02:03:05.074 --> 02:03:08.975]  I mean, this is a criminal takeover, is what it is.
[02:03:08.975 --> 02:03:09.455]  That's right.
[02:03:09.455 --> 02:03:16.377]  I just wish, I know it's a really tough thing to take in, being the actual William Wallace.
[02:03:16.377 --> 02:03:18.057]  I know we are in the info war, but
[02:03:18.601 --> 02:03:27.728]  You know, to actually be out there, you know, physically, you know, it's just that, that to me is the most encouraging thing that I can think of that you could possibly do.
[02:03:27.728 --> 02:03:41.358]  Well, now MSNBC shows videos of 1957 with Republican President Eisenhower sending the National Guard in to block the governor who wouldn't let black kids go to school and
[02:03:45.177 --> 02:03:49.220]  She has the nerve to say that's the Republicans trying to control the border.
[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:57.045]  The Republicans, the leadership, Boehner and all the rest of them, are the ones that wrote the original amnesty bill that Obama's trying to pass.
[02:03:57.045 --> 02:04:00.908]  The Republican leadership wants this, so they give the right cover.
[02:04:00.908 --> 02:04:07.212]  Oh, we put some National Guard down there to act as like UPS workers to ship the illegals in on a conveyor belt.
[02:04:07.212 --> 02:04:12.575]  I mean, that's how they destroy us, is the Republicans play the part of the opposition.
[02:04:12.575 --> 02:04:14.397]  She outrageously calls them racist.
[02:04:15.297 --> 02:04:20.860]  Because they're there helping ship the illegals in, knowing her viewers are literally the dumbest people on the planet.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:23.781]  I mean, how do you defeat such savage deception?
[02:04:23.781 --> 02:04:33.326]  Where it's not just... It's not just Perry, the governor, shipping the illegals in, it's Melissa Harris Perry lying and giving him left cover.
[02:04:33.326 --> 02:04:34.006]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:04:35.188 --> 02:04:37.749]  Yeah, yeah, the fiat currency backing it all.
[02:04:37.749 --> 02:04:38.430]  Backing every position.
[02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:44.193]  How dare you, Perry, be trying to control the border, Melissa Harris Perry says.
[02:04:44.193 --> 02:04:50.977]  Meanwhile, he's got National Guard down there to deliver the illegals into the country.
[02:04:50.977 --> 02:04:53.518]  Oh man, he got the National Chamber of Commerce for it.
[02:04:53.518 --> 02:04:57.561]  They all want it, because they want you poor and dumber than a box of rocks.
[02:04:59.949 --> 02:05:00.249]  I didn't.
[02:05:00.249 --> 02:05:01.210]  I taste dirt in it.
[02:05:01.210 --> 02:05:02.531]  God knows what's in there.
[02:05:02.531 --> 02:05:06.815]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:05:06.815 --> 02:05:12.840]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:13.921]  That one is better.
[02:05:13.921 --> 02:05:15.182]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:05:15.182 --> 02:05:15.462]  Yep.
[02:05:15.462 --> 02:05:16.643]  I know what good water tastes like.
[02:05:16.643 --> 02:05:17.144]  It's good water.
[02:05:17.244 --> 02:05:23.307]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:05:23.307 --> 02:05:30.650]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:05:30.650 --> 02:05:33.372]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:05:33.372 --> 02:05:41.555]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:05:41.555 --> 02:05:43.036]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:05:43.036 --> 02:05:43.796]  It's good water.
[02:05:43.796 --> 02:05:44.417]  Refreshing.
[02:05:44.417 --> 02:05:44.737]  It's good!

[02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.650]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:00.114 --> 02:06:02.416]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:06:02.416 --> 02:06:09.840]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:20.668]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:06:20.668 --> 02:06:29.914]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:06:30.634 --> 02:06:34.698]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:06:34.698 --> 02:06:38.461]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:06:38.461 --> 02:06:40.523]  Experience the new formula.
[02:06:40.523 --> 02:06:43.105]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:06:43.105 --> 02:06:44.426]  Shield your family.
[02:06:44.426 --> 02:06:46.247]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:06:46.247 --> 02:06:49.410]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.

[02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:08.373]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:13.940]  I think?
[02:07:34.514 --> 02:07:36.735]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[02:07:36.735 --> 02:07:38.215]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[02:07:38.215 --> 02:07:38.916]  It's a depression.
[02:08:04.781 --> 02:08:09.087]  Everybody's out of work, or scared of losing their job.
[02:08:09.087 --> 02:08:11.090]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[02:08:11.090 --> 02:08:12.191]  Banks are going bust.
[02:08:12.191 --> 02:08:14.755]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[02:08:14.755 --> 02:08:16.357]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[02:08:16.357 --> 02:08:18.921]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it!
[02:08:20.569 --> 02:08:21.410]  We know.
[02:08:21.410 --> 02:08:23.092]  The air is unfit to breathe.
[02:08:23.092 --> 02:08:24.534]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[02:08:24.534 --> 02:08:34.084]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
[02:08:34.084 --> 02:08:36.127]  We know things are bad, worse than bad!
[02:08:36.747 --> 02:08:37.667]  They're crazy!
[02:08:37.667 --> 02:08:41.089]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[02:08:41.089 --> 02:08:48.031]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[02:08:48.031 --> 02:08:52.593]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-built radios and I won't say anything.
[02:08:52.593 --> 02:08:53.654]  Just leave us alone.
[02:08:53.654 --> 02:08:55.914]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[02:08:55.914 --> 02:08:57.015]  I want you to get mad!
[02:08:58.206 --> 02:08:59.227]  I don't want you to protest.
[02:08:59.227 --> 02:09:00.307]  I don't want you to riot.
[02:09:00.307 --> 02:09:03.629]  I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:08.251]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[02:09:08.251 --> 02:09:11.253]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[02:09:11.253 --> 02:09:13.374]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[02:09:13.374 --> 02:09:16.196]  My life has value!
[02:09:16.196 --> 02:09:19.658]  I want you to get up now.
[02:09:19.658 --> 02:09:21.679]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[02:09:23.067 --> 02:09:33.352]  I want you to get up right now, go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:09:33.352 --> 02:09:36.774]  I want you to get up right now.
[02:09:36.774 --> 02:09:47.359]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:09:47.359 --> 02:09:48.660]  I'm a human being!
[02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:49.881]  My life has value!
[02:09:52.557 --> 02:09:55.518]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:09:55.518 --> 02:10:00.200]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:03.041]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday edition.
[02:10:03.041 --> 02:10:14.686]  William Gein of Alipac up there on Capitol Hill will give us the DC breakdown on what's happening with the North American Union, implosion of our borders and ways to fight back against it.
[02:10:14.686 --> 02:10:18.188]  Or run up the white flag and then the level of tyranny will just intensify.
[02:10:18.188 --> 02:10:21.489]  Thomas Jefferson said the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact level you put up with.
[02:10:22.495 --> 02:10:25.197]  And a lot of other news as well.
[02:10:25.197 --> 02:10:32.801]  Important things are happening like five costumed characters have been arrested Saturday in Times Square.
[02:10:32.801 --> 02:10:40.205]  The New York Times says when media mergers limit more than competition, the censorship of news.
[02:10:40.205 --> 02:10:46.609]  Also Hamas chief says we cannot coexist with occupiers and that they do not basically want to cease fire.
[02:10:49.684 --> 02:11:01.953]  You know, that's my issue, is that it's like a cause celeb, where the only time anybody in the left cares about a war is when it's Israel in a war.
[02:11:01.953 --> 02:11:06.537]  And I'm neutral on the issue, and I think it's terrible, and both sides have major problems.
[02:11:06.537 --> 02:11:09.679]  I'm on record about that.
[02:11:09.679 --> 02:11:13.102]  And it's very polarized, where you're supposed to choose one side or the other.
[02:11:17.096 --> 02:11:35.270]  But I see Al-Qaeda, ISIS, or IS as it's now known, they keep changing the name to get away from our government funding them, killing over 300,000 people, conservatively, in Syria and now tens of thousands in Iraq, blowing up churches every day, murdering men, women, and children.
[02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:42.456]  Mainline organizations like the UN admit that Christians may be extincted in Syria and Iraq under this.
[02:11:42.456 --> 02:11:44.017]  They've survived thousands of years, 2,000 years.
[02:11:46.869 --> 02:11:51.911]  Almost zero coverage, and you don't hear a word from anybody.
[02:11:51.911 --> 02:12:02.596]  And then the anti-Israel crowd will have like three articles criticizing, you know, stuff Israel's doing, and then some articles criticizing something that, you know, Hamas is doing.
[02:12:02.596 --> 02:12:04.677]  And then they'll be, Alex is covering up!
[02:12:04.677 --> 02:12:06.238]  There's no Gaza coverage!
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:12.742]  Because intellectually, that's how you prove you're better.
[02:12:12.742 --> 02:12:14.963]  Oh, Alex doesn't cover the North American Union.
[02:12:14.963 --> 02:12:16.324]  Alex doesn't cover the Federal Reserve.
[02:12:16.324 --> 02:12:18.325]  Alex doesn't cover offshoring.
[02:12:18.325 --> 02:12:23.988]  Alex doesn't cover, you know, what's happening over in the Middle East.
[02:12:23.988 --> 02:12:26.749]  Alex doesn't... I cover it all.
[02:12:26.749 --> 02:12:32.432]  But there's this fake intellectual thing where people just say, he doesn't cover the Vatican.
[02:12:32.432 --> 02:12:35.094]  Or he doesn't... Yeah, he works for Israel.
[02:12:35.094 --> 02:12:35.574]  Yeah, he...
[02:12:38.499 --> 02:12:41.900]  Instead of getting out and fighting the tyranny.
[02:12:41.900 --> 02:12:47.702]  I mean, Egypt just destroyed a whole bunch of tunnels out of Gaza into Egypt.
[02:12:47.702 --> 02:12:53.204]  You got that Gaza crew connected into trying to overthrow the Egyptian government.
[02:12:53.204 --> 02:12:58.405]  What, do the Egyptians not let the Gazans in because they hate Arabs or Muslims?
[02:12:58.405 --> 02:13:00.826]  No folks, it's because it's a political football.
[02:13:02.284 --> 02:13:05.386]  And a destabilizing force in the region.
[02:13:05.386 --> 02:13:09.529]  You can say, well that's because Israel took over and did what they did in 1947.
[02:13:09.529 --> 02:13:12.751]  Israel's got 800 nuclear weapons, they're not going anywhere.
[02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:14.552]  So why is it the cause celeb again?
[02:13:17.657 --> 02:13:25.921]  To talk about the Israeli-Palestine conflict, because that's all you're supposed to know about while all hell's breaking loose everywhere else.
[02:13:25.921 --> 02:13:29.222]  I mean, you got over a thousand people killed in Gaza.
[02:13:29.222 --> 02:13:33.584]  Civilian targets are being hit because the people firing at the Israelis are in those areas.
[02:13:33.584 --> 02:13:38.126]  That's just a fact of war, and I think it's terrible, and I think it's wrong, and I think it's bad.
[02:13:38.126 --> 02:13:41.427]  But a thousand versus three hundred thousand?
[02:13:41.427 --> 02:13:45.029]  Can I get three hundred times the coverage?
[02:13:45.993 --> 02:13:46.713]  If numbers count?
[02:13:46.713 --> 02:13:47.473]  No, I can't.
[02:13:47.473 --> 02:13:58.197]  I can't get 1% the coverage of Al-Qaeda murdering Christians and non-radical Muslims, moderate Muslims, all over Africa, all over the Middle East.
[02:13:58.197 --> 02:14:00.117]  I'm sick of it.
[02:14:00.117 --> 02:14:02.238]  And you expose that and make it a big issue?
[02:14:02.238 --> 02:14:05.039]  That's it for the New World Order, folks.
[02:14:05.039 --> 02:14:06.099]  You know why?
[02:14:06.099 --> 02:14:15.302]  Because then it'll come out that there's a criminal group above our government, like Spectre, funding this.
[02:14:16.343 --> 02:14:19.346]  To destabilize the world.
[02:14:19.346 --> 02:14:25.073]  See, I don't like the news, what I'm supposed to cover being set for me.
[02:14:25.073 --> 02:14:32.982]  Sometimes if something's a big issue, and MSNBC says the open borders are like the new civil rights movement, and that's the big national story, I'll cover it all the time.
[02:14:32.982 --> 02:14:37.386]  Not because it's the big story they made, but because their lies are big, I'm going to counter it.
[02:14:38.027 --> 02:14:42.150]  But most of the time I don't cover what the big fake story is.
[02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:48.074]  We end up covering what we think is important and many times make it an international national story.
[02:14:48.074 --> 02:14:54.038]  We're here to really change the world folks, not sit here with a political football of Israel versus Palestine.
[02:14:56.054 --> 02:14:58.235]  And relish hating Israel.
[02:14:58.235 --> 02:15:03.237]  Again, I don't like how the pro-Israel folks will bully me if I criticize Israel moderately.
[02:15:03.237 --> 02:15:10.779]  And I don't like how the pro-Palestinian people will bully me, and lie about me, and act like a bunch of fools, and put out a bunch of disinfo as well.
[02:15:10.779 --> 02:15:15.021]  I'm not taking a side, and I don't like being conscripted into one of the camps.
[02:15:16.471 --> 02:15:19.673]  It's a tragic tribal warfare, and I'm sick of it.
[02:15:19.673 --> 02:15:23.015]  I want to go to Lab Rat, Michelle, Bill, John, Phyllis, and others.
[02:15:23.015 --> 02:15:25.517]  Let's go to Lab Rat in New Mexico.
[02:15:25.517 --> 02:15:26.618]  You're on the air, Lab Rat.
[02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:28.339]  Go ahead.
[02:15:28.339 --> 02:15:29.940]  Alex, you are on fire.
[02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:34.763]  That was maybe the best introduction I have ever heard, and I've been listening to you for a decade.
[02:15:35.789 --> 02:15:36.449]  Way to go.
[02:15:36.449 --> 02:15:45.132]  I want to give a quick message today to Victory with regard to Nathan Iodine and not just consulting but educating the doctors.
[02:15:45.132 --> 02:15:59.015]  I'd like to give a quick message to the Pharisees from a preacher's son and then I'd like to talk about the weaponization of social sciences and the desperation of the New World Order to get a handle on us because they're failing and all of their attempts have failed.
[02:15:59.015 --> 02:16:01.016]  Can we get through those things real quick?
[02:16:02.293 --> 02:16:05.195]  Shakespeare said, truth is truth to the end of reckoning.
[02:16:05.195 --> 02:16:09.598]  It's in the water, it's in the air, it's in everything we eat, drink, breathe.
[02:16:09.598 --> 02:16:11.899]  Veritas is truth.
[02:16:11.899 --> 02:16:16.922]  To the Pharisees, I say we are called to be in the world, not of the world.
[02:16:16.922 --> 02:16:18.544]  We are called to be light and salt.
[02:16:18.544 --> 02:16:25.428]  If salt loses its flavor or savor, it's good for nothing, Jesus said, but to be thrown out and trod underfoot.
[02:16:25.428 --> 02:16:29.911]  Faith without works is dead, and let's not forget that behind every Melissa
[02:16:30.512 --> 02:16:38.114]  Perry, whatever her name is, is a psychological operations division making talking points for the media right now.
[02:16:38.114 --> 02:16:41.975]  It's in our entertainment and it's in our infotainment.
[02:16:41.975 --> 02:16:43.536]  Secondly, victory story.
[02:16:43.536 --> 02:16:50.098]  I consulted my doctor about nascent iodine because I had a miraculous, what I call, miracle experience.
[02:16:50.098 --> 02:16:55.019]  Ten days uptake and a damaged brain from an injury became completely whole again.
[02:16:55.592 --> 02:16:58.114]  None of my doctors had seen anything like it.
[02:16:58.114 --> 02:17:02.076]  I consulted them about NanoSilver and about Xanthine Iodine.
[02:17:02.076 --> 02:17:03.957]  None of them knew anything about it.
[02:17:03.957 --> 02:17:06.638]  I sent them all to Infowarslife.com.
[02:17:06.638 --> 02:17:10.761]  They all immediately Googled it, went through, watched the videos.
[02:17:10.761 --> 02:17:16.464]  One of my doctors is going to start taking Super Female Vitality and get back to me at my next appointment.
[02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:17.381]  We're good to go.
[02:17:29.975 --> 02:17:34.577]  I was working on something called Claire, with a capital A-I.
[02:17:34.577 --> 02:17:46.003]  Claire was eventually going to be what Eric Schmidt wanted, and that was a computer in every home where you would simply say, Claire, can you, and then it would find or do whatever you wanted.
[02:17:46.003 --> 02:17:47.503]  So it's like Siri?
[02:17:47.503 --> 02:17:48.384]  It's like Siri.
[02:17:48.384 --> 02:17:53.086]  It's Siri on steroids, and when we realized what it was and DARPA had approached us,
[02:17:53.755 --> 02:18:04.137]  Because of the Semantic Web Conference address and other things, we decided to disband and move our separate ways and go to different things, all of us.
[02:18:04.137 --> 02:18:06.438]  They lack the algorithm, Alex.
[02:18:06.438 --> 02:18:07.918]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[02:18:07.918 --> 02:18:13.359]  FedBizOpps.gov, looking for game-changer private sector investment.
[02:18:13.359 --> 02:18:16.480]  Because they're only successful, what was it?
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:21.501]  Four out of eleven or four out of sixteen scenarios were successfully predicted.
[02:18:22.273 --> 02:18:25.335]  And David Knight brought up an interesting thing from a caller yesterday.
[02:18:25.335 --> 02:18:27.277]  Maybe they're not trying to predict it.
[02:18:27.277 --> 02:18:30.299]  Maybe they're trying to start social unrest.
[02:18:30.299 --> 02:18:32.000]  That has never occurred to me.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.722]  Oh, they are definitely starting it.
[02:18:34.722 --> 02:18:38.765]  But again, so they can trigger it, so they can lead it and control it.
[02:18:40.458 --> 02:18:40.998]  Correct.
[02:18:40.998 --> 02:18:48.665]  I don't know what the scenario is, but I know that they're desperate to get their hands around every single piece of human information, and I quote, that can be collected.
[02:18:48.665 --> 02:18:49.825]  I know, I agree.
[02:18:49.825 --> 02:18:51.567]  I want to shift gears back to the nascent ionize.
[02:18:51.567 --> 02:18:54.269]  Specifically, what happened when you started taking it?
[02:18:54.269 --> 02:18:57.471]  Was it X2 or the regular survival shield?
[02:18:57.471 --> 02:19:00.654]  It was the regular because I'm doing what you suggested.
[02:19:00.654 --> 02:19:01.615]  I've been taking it.
[02:19:01.615 --> 02:19:02.195]  I stopped.
[02:19:02.195 --> 02:19:04.337]  I had a severe, severe injury.
[02:19:04.744 --> 02:19:06.966]  I've been given a clean mental bill of health.
[02:19:06.966 --> 02:19:07.887]  I've been given everything.
[02:19:07.887 --> 02:19:09.909]  I can't give away too much information.
[02:19:09.909 --> 02:19:12.032]  Let me tell you, I've been pinged.
[02:19:12.032 --> 02:19:13.733]  I got in trouble for my last call.
[02:19:13.733 --> 02:19:16.777]  You remember me.
[02:19:16.777 --> 02:19:17.397]  I'm not working.
[02:19:17.397 --> 02:19:21.101]  I remember you called in with a bunch of information about algorithms and things.
[02:19:21.101 --> 02:19:23.203]  Very interesting.
[02:19:23.203 --> 02:19:26.727]  They're using entertainment concepts, marketing concepts.
[02:19:26.727 --> 02:19:27.548]  The guys that
[02:19:28.363 --> 02:19:32.230]  Alright, and let me just tell you, New Mexico is the biggest victim of dumbing down.
[02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:39.262]  You've never seen a collective, and everyone I've dealt with in my scenarios, not from here, comment on how they cannot believe
[02:19:39.864 --> 02:19:41.685]  The level of what they call stupidity.
[02:19:41.685 --> 02:19:45.128]  I have pity on these people for 50 years.
[02:19:45.128 --> 02:19:54.074]  The government brought in heroin when the Brown movement, the Latino movement, was mobilizing against what they were doing in their backyards here.
[02:19:54.074 --> 02:19:55.695]  They spray here regularly.

[02:19:56.255 --> 02:19:56.555]  Oh, I know.
[02:19:56.555 --> 02:19:58.237]  It's massive social engineering.
[02:19:58.957 --> 02:19:59.437]  We'll be back.
[02:19:59.437 --> 02:19:59.938]  Thank you for the call.
[02:20:17.447 --> 02:20:23.793]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic anytime.
[02:20:23.793 --> 02:20:28.658]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[02:20:28.658 --> 02:20:31.540]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:37.125]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.

[02:21:58.935 --> 02:22:04.058]  It seems that everywhere you turn to these days, people are talking about the health benefits of silver.
[02:22:04.058 --> 02:22:07.200]  But don't be fooled into believing all silver is the same.
[02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:13.043]  Only one silver solution has been clinically shown to be hundreds of times stronger than colloidal or ionic silver.
[02:22:13.323 --> 02:22:15.525]  That's Supernatural Silver.

[02:22:25.413 --> 02:22:29.016]  It's even gentle enough to be used on the ears, eyes, and sinuses.
[02:22:29.016 --> 02:22:33.440]  And unlike harsh drugs and antibiotics, Supernatural Silver has no side effects.
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:38.685]  Available as a liquid or a gel that you can use every day to stay healthy and well.

[02:24:11.297 --> 02:24:12.498]  Headline!
[02:24:12.498 --> 02:24:16.162]  Obama will take care of us, say MS-13 members.
[02:24:16.162 --> 02:24:21.709]  Violent MS-13 gang members recruiting at Arizona facility, LA Times.
[02:24:21.709 --> 02:24:26.654]  Amnesty work permits for five million could be ordered within weeks.
[02:24:26.654 --> 02:24:28.776]  Visa overstays to be excused.
[02:24:29.597 --> 02:24:33.939]  Scott Brown becomes first Senate candidate to run ad on the crisis.
[02:24:33.939 --> 02:24:39.002]  National polls show 77% of Americans want illegals sent home.
[02:24:39.002 --> 02:24:41.803]  80 plus percent say it's wrong.
[02:24:41.803 --> 02:24:47.386]  There's video of a coyote on jet skis delivering the illegals to the U.S.
[02:24:47.386 --> 02:24:48.546]  in broad daylight.
[02:24:48.546 --> 02:24:52.208]  Jerry Brown kicks off trade mission in Mexico.
[02:24:52.208 --> 02:24:54.589]  This is the North American Union.
[02:24:54.589 --> 02:24:56.750]  That's some of the news up on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:24:59.031 --> 02:25:07.982]  We have breaking news up on InfoWars.com, where in the event of hurricanes or emergencies, the illegals will be taken care of first.
[02:25:07.982 --> 02:25:10.365]  That's from the federal and state government.
[02:25:10.365 --> 02:25:13.949]  In event of emergency, illegals will be evacuated before citizens.
[02:25:13.949 --> 02:25:15.351]  Adon Salazar reports.
[02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:21.170]  New studies out says mass government spying crushes freedom of the press.
[02:25:21.170 --> 02:25:22.090]  Whistleblower.
[02:25:22.090 --> 02:25:27.152]  LA planning to forcibly house homeless citizens in camps.
[02:25:27.152 --> 02:25:33.653]  They're paying Democratic families all over the country $6,000 a month to hold upwards of three illegals per house.
[02:25:33.653 --> 02:25:36.534]  This is also a giant scam.
[02:25:36.534 --> 02:25:40.095]  We are joined by the chairman and head of Alipac.
[02:25:41.471 --> 02:25:47.482]  Alipac.us, A-L-I-P-A-C.us, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:25:47.482 --> 02:25:50.507]  They've got some solutions to fight back against this.
[02:25:50.507 --> 02:25:51.990]  William Gein is the leader.
[02:25:52.884 --> 02:26:06.749]  of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC or Alipac, alipac.com, williamgehm.com and they have been right there getting us the intel that barely defeated the bipartisan bills under Bush and now Obama.
[02:26:06.749 --> 02:26:09.570]  But instead we're seeing the borders dropped by Fiat.
[02:26:09.570 --> 02:26:13.872]  He's up there at Capitol Hill lobbying for national sovereignty every day.
[02:26:13.872 --> 02:26:19.034]  So in this short segment, sir, thank you for joining us via video Skype for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[02:26:19.034 --> 02:26:21.855]  But first give us the big picture because you and
[02:26:22.455 --> 02:26:27.599]  Glenn Spencer and others warned of this collapse plan for a long time.
[02:26:27.599 --> 02:26:31.062]  And quite frankly, a lot of people rolled their eyes, including myself.
[02:26:31.062 --> 02:26:35.686]  Not that I didn't respect you, I just didn't understand they could be this bold.
[02:26:35.686 --> 02:26:43.552]  And if they get away with this, it'd be like a pervert raping children in broad daylight at a school playground and not getting in trouble.
[02:26:43.552 --> 02:26:45.734]  I mean, this is really getting crazy.
[02:26:45.734 --> 02:26:46.415]  What's happening?
[02:26:47.388 --> 02:26:51.211]  If you were ever going to do anything to help your country, this is the time to do it.
[02:26:51.211 --> 02:26:58.737]  If we fail at what our mission is between today and this weekend and November 4th, this could become the last ride of the Americans.
[02:26:58.737 --> 02:27:00.018]  They're going for broke.
[02:27:00.018 --> 02:27:01.439]  They're right outside, just doing it.
[02:27:01.439 --> 02:27:02.760]  They're in everybody's face.
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:03.841]  The public is upset.
[02:27:04.201 --> 02:27:08.123]  And that's why the plans that I want to talk about with you and your audience today are so important.
[02:27:08.123 --> 02:27:11.784]  We have to give people a plan to come out of this thing.
[02:27:11.784 --> 02:27:15.086]  Otherwise, when people are faced with this type of situation, they feel powerless.
[02:27:15.086 --> 02:27:16.406]  They'll start shutting down.
[02:27:16.406 --> 02:27:19.148]  And if America's shut down on this one, it's over.
[02:27:19.148 --> 02:27:20.368]  We've got illegal immigration.
[02:27:20.368 --> 02:27:24.090]  It's the top issue in America going right into the 2014 elections.
[02:27:24.090 --> 02:27:29.652]  And if we do the right things, and we say the right things, and we organize well, we can throw more people out in D.C.
[02:27:29.652 --> 02:27:31.213]  who are responsible for this invasion
[02:27:34.994 --> 02:27:35.734]  I agree with you.
[02:27:35.734 --> 02:27:38.815]  The globalists have really miscalculated out of desperation.
[02:27:38.815 --> 02:27:48.519]  All the signs, all the political numbers, even mainline pundits say total libertarian Tea Party sweep of Republican bluebloods and Democratic seats and a real reversal.
[02:27:48.519 --> 02:27:55.381]  So this is really a desperation move by the globalists to implode the borders, bring in the North American Union.
[02:27:56.081 --> 02:27:56.501]  That's true.
[02:27:56.501 --> 02:28:00.563]  And if they get much further along without us stopping them, it's going to be too late.
[02:28:00.563 --> 02:28:09.327]  And people that come in after this election season saying, well, I want to help or I want to do something, we may still be fighting back politically, but we're going to have to tell them that it's too little, too late.
[02:28:09.327 --> 02:28:24.814]  Right now, in about five days, on Saturday, August 2nd, we're going to kick off a new wave of national protests against illegal immigration in the targeted states of Tennessee, Michigan, and Washington State, of which Tennessee is the most important because that's the last place in America
[02:28:25.154 --> 02:28:31.557]  Well, we have one more Eric Cantor amnesty-supporting type Republican, Senator Lamar Alexander, to try to throw down.
[02:28:31.557 --> 02:28:35.538]  But for the reasons we can discuss later in the broadcast... Alexander must fall.
[02:28:35.538 --> 02:28:38.680]  Alexander must fall, and it's going to take a national movement.
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:50.325]  I repeat, it is going to take a national movement to defeat Lamar Alexander and to elect Joe Carr in the GOP primary that takes place Thursday, August 7th.
[02:28:50.925 --> 02:29:08.671]  And we need as many bodies as possible in Tennessee and surrounding states traveling to be with us Saturday, August 2nd as we protest outside of six locations in Tennessee outside of Lamar Alexander's district offices to remind the country and all Tennesseans that Lamar Alexander is the reason we have a border surge.
[02:29:08.671 --> 02:29:18.794]  He voted for and passed Senate Bill S44, which would turn tens of millions of illegals into future voters, competitive workers, and social welfare recipients.
[02:29:18.794 --> 02:29:19.875]  Lamar Alexander
[02:29:20.435 --> 02:29:21.216]  No, I know you did.
[02:29:21.216 --> 02:29:22.857]  Let's talk about a strategy to win.
[02:29:43.311 --> 02:29:47.599]  And let's look at the enemy strategy here, using these poor immigrants.
[02:29:47.599 --> 02:29:49.042]  But I think it's going to backfire.
[02:29:49.042 --> 02:29:50.424]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.424 --> 02:29:51.647]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.647 --> 02:29:52.188]  Alipac.com.
[02:29:52.188 --> 02:29:52.789]  Alipac.com.
[02:29:59.946 --> 02:30:02.327]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:02.327 --> 02:30:05.149]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[02:30:05.149 --> 02:30:11.333]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[02:30:11.333 --> 02:30:16.415]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[02:30:16.415 --> 02:30:21.298]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[02:30:21.298 --> 02:30:25.801]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[02:30:26.101 --> 02:30:34.704]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:30:34.704 --> 02:30:36.865]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[02:30:36.865 --> 02:30:48.049]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[02:30:48.049 --> 02:30:55.452]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.

[02:31:00.155 --> 02:31:07.319]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:07.319 --> 02:31:09.680]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:14.963]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:14.963 --> 02:31:19.946]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:20.106 --> 02:31:23.428]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:23.428 --> 02:31:27.511]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:27.511 --> 02:31:31.833]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:31.833 --> 02:31:42.059]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:42.059 --> 02:31:44.581]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:31:44.781 --> 02:31:52.992]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:31:52.992 --> 02:31:56.957]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:00.157 --> 02:32:03.979]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:32:03.979 --> 02:32:05.239]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[02:32:05.239 --> 02:32:06.540]  God knows what's in there.
[02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:10.802]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:32:10.802 --> 02:32:16.544]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:32:16.704 --> 02:32:17.764]  That one is better.
[02:32:17.764 --> 02:32:19.005]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:32:19.005 --> 02:32:20.425]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:32:20.425 --> 02:32:21.085]  It's good water.
[02:32:21.085 --> 02:32:27.047]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:32:27.047 --> 02:32:34.288]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:32:34.288 --> 02:32:37.949]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:32:37.949 --> 02:32:44.911]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:32:44.991 --> 02:32:46.472]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:32:46.472 --> 02:32:47.292]  Good water.
[02:32:47.292 --> 02:32:47.872]  Refreshing.
[02:32:47.872 --> 02:32:48.513]  It's good!

[02:33:08.365 --> 02:33:11.108]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:11.108 --> 02:33:11.889]  That's right.
[02:33:11.889 --> 02:33:23.861]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:23.861 --> 02:33:30.428]  Yeah, we're in the danger zone, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:33.956 --> 02:33:35.637]  You gotta hand it to the globalists, though.
[02:33:35.637 --> 02:33:42.559]  Like all master criminals, they are incredibly bold, they have a lot of panache, a lot of flair.
[02:33:42.559 --> 02:33:44.699]  They are outlandish.
[02:33:44.699 --> 02:33:50.661]  Imagine, we already have the most open borders in the world, the most open welfare for immigrants in the world.
[02:33:50.661 --> 02:33:53.922]  It's only Western Europe and the United States that do this.
[02:33:53.922 --> 02:33:55.763]  Totally wide open.
[02:33:55.763 --> 02:34:00.064]  If you can get here, free healthcare, pay for your baby, massive welfare.
[02:34:01.829 --> 02:34:17.720]  And see these Latin American immigrants on average have been perfect because they are hard-working on average and have a lot of ingenuity and are smart, but then they'll also work the system and go get on welfare at the same time as a supplemental under multiple identities.
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:18.780]  But forget that now.
[02:34:18.780 --> 02:34:19.501]  This isn't like
[02:34:21.074 --> 02:34:30.858]  You know, like 30, 40 years ago having migrants that went back and forth to do the hard work out in California where you didn't have a big farming population.
[02:34:30.858 --> 02:34:42.963]  This is the collapse of Latin America that is in total shambles right now in the global depression in an agreed deal with Guatemala, Mexico, and the US to bring in unlimited illegals
[02:34:43.903 --> 02:34:54.491]  Who have diseases, who have huge criminal records, who have mental issues, who are handicapped, who are totally ready to fall in as Democratic Party voters.
[02:34:54.491 --> 02:35:04.698]  And then Melissa Harris Perry gets up and says, you are racist, like the Klan, if you aren't for totally open borders.
[02:35:04.698 --> 02:35:06.780]  I mean, that is just wild.
[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:09.742]  It'd be one thing if they said anybody can come here but no welfare.
[02:35:09.742 --> 02:35:11.944]  That would still be pretty wild.
[02:35:13.126 --> 02:35:15.368]  But I'd be, eh, okay, fine.
[02:35:15.368 --> 02:35:20.032]  Because, you know, we've killed 50-something million of our babies, we need to replace the population.
[02:35:20.032 --> 02:35:21.153]  But no, no, no, no, no.
[02:35:21.153 --> 02:35:27.499]  If you took all the middle class people out of Latin America, there's not many down there, it would collapse.
[02:35:27.499 --> 02:35:35.165]  In fact, some of the middle class down there is better than our middle class, because you've got to work really hard and know what you're doing to survive in these kleptocracies.
[02:35:35.165 --> 02:35:37.868]  If the middle class of Latin America wanted to come up here, great!
[02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:46.724]  I know a lot of rich and middle class Mexicans that have fled up here, and they'll stop me downtown going, Mr. Jones, you don't know how deadly Mexico is.
[02:35:46.724 --> 02:35:47.724]  I had to leave.
[02:35:47.724 --> 02:35:52.847]  They used to kidnap people, and they took over my restaurant, or they took over my factory, or they killed my wife.
[02:35:52.847 --> 02:35:54.107]  I mean, everywhere I go.
[02:35:54.107 --> 02:35:57.509]  I was in a restaurant once, and the owner was Mexican from Mexico.
[02:35:57.509 --> 02:35:59.190]  Turned out he was like some famous boxer.
[02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.730]  He runs there.
[02:35:59.730 --> 02:36:02.972]  He was like 70 years old, something like Ricardo Montalban.
[02:36:02.972 --> 02:36:04.853]  He's like, Mr. Jones, you have no idea how bad it is.
[02:36:04.853 --> 02:36:05.973]  You're absolutely right.
[02:36:05.973 --> 02:36:07.314]  It's collapsing, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:36:08.746 --> 02:36:11.649]  Wait till the average yuppie finds out how bad this is.
[02:36:11.649 --> 02:36:14.853]  I want to go back to William Gein of alipac.com.
[02:36:14.853 --> 02:36:16.615]  A-L-I-P-A-C dot com.
[02:36:16.615 --> 02:36:19.478]  There is a strategy, like with Kanner.
[02:36:20.518 --> 02:36:21.939]  And others to destroy them.
[02:36:21.939 --> 02:36:35.151]  That's why the, because they're destroying us, that's why the Republican leadership with the big classic Republican donors have lined up with the Democrats to double down money against Tea Party people at the city, county, state, federal level.
[02:36:35.151 --> 02:36:39.455]  Because they can see the numbers that people understand what's happening.
[02:36:39.455 --> 02:36:40.997]  And let's just be honest here.
[02:36:40.997 --> 02:36:42.758]  There's probably 20% of the Republican Party
[02:36:43.638 --> 02:36:48.680]  That doesn't like seeing a bunch of brown people running around and doing it because of racism.
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:52.421]  But I know, Mr. Gein, I know myself, this is about survival.
[02:36:52.421 --> 02:36:53.081]  Okay?
[02:36:53.081 --> 02:36:56.802]  Latin American countries hate each other, folks, and have riots over soccer games.
[02:36:56.802 --> 02:37:02.104]  You cannot bring in masses of people from collapsed countries like this and not have a total meltdown.
[02:37:02.104 --> 02:37:05.886]  So you got a bunch of racists on the Hispanic side, a bunch of racists on the white side.
[02:37:05.886 --> 02:37:06.906]  This isn't about that.
[02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:10.724]  I'm not dumb enough to care about the color of somebody's skin.
[02:37:10.724 --> 02:37:13.127]  I care about the content of their minds.
[02:37:13.127 --> 02:37:18.293]  And the Democrats want these people here, pure and simple, to turn the whole country blue.
[02:37:18.293 --> 02:37:20.375]  And the Republican traitors are working with them.
[02:37:20.375 --> 02:37:21.857]  You've got the floor, sir, to break it down.
[02:37:21.857 --> 02:37:23.639]  William Gein, the head of Alipac.com.
[02:37:24.738 --> 02:37:28.681]  Well, what's happening right now, Alex, we believe is more than just campaigns and protests.
[02:37:28.681 --> 02:37:34.825]  We believe that there's a new movement rising rapidly in America that's beyond the men and beyond the Tea Party.
[02:37:34.825 --> 02:37:42.010]  And it seems to be involving a lot of different groups and other types, different types of Americans that weren't working together before.
[02:37:42.010 --> 02:37:49.615]  Combined with people who are starting to abandon Obama and the Democrats, including blacks, Hispanics, white liberals in cities.
[02:37:49.615 --> 02:37:53.097]  Everyone's waking up to Obama as he tries to run across the field with this.
[02:37:53.097 --> 02:37:54.658]  So we have a movement that's building.
[02:37:54.938 --> 02:37:58.824]  And we have some very, very encouraging information of things that just happened.
[02:37:58.824 --> 02:38:05.693]  You know, just last weekend, we held over 300 protests across this country on July 18th and 19th.
[02:38:05.693 --> 02:38:08.136]  Some were as small as 5 or 10 people on an overpass.
[02:38:08.136 --> 02:38:10.339]  Some of them had 100 people, but they were in 300 locations.
[02:38:11.841 --> 02:38:22.428]  Against illegal immigration, against immigration reform amnesty legislation, and against the current Obama-inspired border surge that we're enduring at our borders right now.
[02:38:22.428 --> 02:38:25.270]  And we did these, and then there was one other.
[02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:29.132]  It was an interesting story because it just broke out of Boston.
[02:38:29.132 --> 02:38:36.877]  We had gotten a note from some people in Boston around a radio show personality that wanted to do one as part of our national protest, but they wanted to do it a week later.
[02:38:36.877 --> 02:38:39.739]  We were like, well, okay, you know, we're trying to get everybody to do it at the same time.
[02:38:40.379 --> 02:38:41.661]  So we did ours.
[02:38:41.661 --> 02:38:43.883]  We broke through the mainstream media.
[02:38:43.883 --> 02:38:56.118]  We generated hundreds of local television, local newspaper, local radio broadcasts that were devoid of the usual racism calls and negative type of bias that we encounter from the mainstream national media.
[02:38:56.118 --> 02:38:57.039]  We bypassed them.
[02:38:57.039 --> 02:38:57.920]  We broke through that.
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:15.249]  Then a week later, this past Saturday, July 26th, truly historic date, Boston, Massachusetts, over 500 American, excuse me, 5,000 American patriots gathered in Boston following a radio show host named Jeff Kooner who did one of these protests.
[02:39:15.249 --> 02:39:27.615]  But of course the Boston Globe takes little bitty up-close pictures of the crowd, claims that only hundreds were there, and is a disinformation campaign worthy of a psychological operation conducted by a military against another nation.
[02:39:28.015 --> 02:39:30.956]  They pumped this out on social media and said, look, Boston.
[02:39:30.956 --> 02:39:33.017]  And we were excited because, hey, you know, a couple hundred people.
[02:39:33.017 --> 02:39:34.237]  That was great.
[02:39:34.237 --> 02:39:37.938]  About an hour and a half later, this past Saturday night, the pictures start coming in.
[02:39:37.938 --> 02:39:43.920]  There are clearly thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people in a liberal bastion like Boston.
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:49.426]  That is chanting, send them back, send them back in USA.
[02:39:49.426 --> 02:39:55.173]  So we have a movement here that we have to nurture and we have to build it up.
[02:39:55.173 --> 02:40:00.320]  It starts this Saturday in three states, Tennessee, Washington State, and Michigan.
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:07.287]  We have protests that are on the front page at alipac.us, A-L-I-P-A-C dot U-S.
[02:40:07.287 --> 02:40:10.250]  And our email alerts will also keep you up to date.
[02:40:10.250 --> 02:40:17.557]  We're on Facebook under Americans for Legal Immigration, but remember that Facebook is Mark Zuckerberg and Obama territory.
[02:40:17.557 --> 02:40:20.300]  Everything you say there is completely recorded and monitored.
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:23.741]  And you can't trust them to let us get to you when we need to.
[02:40:23.741 --> 02:40:25.462]  So we'll start on the 2nd.
[02:40:25.462 --> 02:40:33.225]  We've got a few more targeted protests, but then we're going to have them all over the country in different places, culminating in a new, hopefully larger national wave.
[02:40:33.225 --> 02:40:41.369]  We want at least 500 protests across the country right before the general elections on Friday, October 24th and Saturday, October 25th.
[02:40:42.429 --> 02:40:44.591]  We want it to be undeniable.
[02:40:44.591 --> 02:40:50.615]  We want it to be so powerful that it doesn't matter what the media does, that they see these protests all across the nation.
[02:40:50.615 --> 02:40:54.298]  And Alex, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but there's something I hope you'll consider.
[02:40:54.298 --> 02:41:09.950]  I hope that you'll ask your staff to start putting our updates on your website about this thing and consider leaving and protest yourself because the indication from what happened in Boston is that if you or other talk radio show personalities out there that are monitoring the situation,
[02:41:10.510 --> 02:41:20.075]  If you go to the ground now, if you reinforce one of these local protests, if you show up as a speaker and talk about it on your show, instead of a few hundred people, we end up with thousands.
[02:41:20.075 --> 02:41:26.559]  And while some radio show hosts may say, well, you know, I just report and I don't really get too involved with the politics of it.
[02:41:26.559 --> 02:41:27.679]  Maybe so.
[02:41:27.679 --> 02:41:30.821]  This is the make or break point for the United States of America.
[02:41:31.181 --> 02:41:35.886]  This is where the country is teetering between destruction and possible salvation.
[02:41:35.886 --> 02:41:41.012]  It's going to be decided between this very day today and November 4th, 2014.
[02:41:41.012 --> 02:41:45.918]  Because we have a chance to throw out more, you know, the goal is to throw Lamar Alexander out.
[02:41:46.278 --> 02:41:47.699]  On August 7th.
[02:41:47.699 --> 02:41:55.001]  And after that, the goal is to wipe out politically every single Democrat running from dog catcher up to U.S.
[02:41:55.001 --> 02:41:55.301]  Senate.
[02:41:55.301 --> 02:41:56.061]  We can't.
[02:41:56.061 --> 02:42:03.664]  The party of Obama has to fall so hard that our political revolution must be stronger than the revolution of 2010.
[02:42:03.664 --> 02:42:05.525]  Stronger than the revolution of 94.
[02:42:05.525 --> 02:42:12.627]  And I believe that all of the stars are aligned for us to do that if the proper activists, citizen support, and leaders will step forth at this time.
[02:42:12.847 --> 02:42:14.188]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:42:14.188 --> 02:42:18.471]  I've always tried to be non-partisan and I've kept Republicans and Democrats at arm's length.
[02:42:18.471 --> 02:42:25.616]  I'm a libertarian constitutionalist so I get attacked more by the Democrats traditionally because they're basically communists at the grassroots level.
[02:42:25.616 --> 02:42:31.581]  Above them are these globalists that are managing any dumbed-down population they can control.
[02:42:31.581 --> 02:42:32.601]  But the Democrats
[02:42:33.763 --> 02:42:39.968]  Under Obama, the last seven years are going for the juggler, shutting down our coal power plants that are totally clean.
[02:42:39.968 --> 02:42:49.375]  And they even have mainstream articles today about how it's making the earth dirtier because Mexico and China and India have no controls and it's all just going there.
[02:42:49.375 --> 02:42:54.559]  Energy prices doubling for electricity, roughly, has made what companies were here leave.
[02:42:54.559 --> 02:43:00.283]  I mean, folks, I say that every day because shutting down our power plants, I mean, that's an act of war.
[02:43:01.317 --> 02:43:10.303]  That's an act of embargoing the nation, devaluing our dollar, funding Al-Qaeda, starting wars with Russia.
[02:43:10.303 --> 02:43:21.610]  I mean, it's just over-the-top how law-law-land nuts it is, and I want to believe that the globalists through Obama at least have some plan.
[02:43:21.610 --> 02:43:28.015]  But when I really pull back from it, they're destroying their own empire, and it really comes down to the fact that the Democratic Party
[02:43:29.136 --> 02:43:48.885]  Really does hate individual wealth and the middle class and I've got an article here where today I was going to get to in a minute when I dig it out where all the majority of billionaires are supporting open borders because they really do want to destroy the middle class and be the only ones with money because the only thing that threatens a big globalist is the middle class that's got a million bucks.
[02:43:49.485 --> 02:43:49.925]  We're good to go.
[02:44:06.610 --> 02:44:10.691]  It makes me angry at them, William.
[02:44:10.691 --> 02:44:16.653]  I realize that the Democratic Party is like Ted Bundy's psychopaths at the highest levels.
[02:44:16.653 --> 02:44:19.514]  They didn't used to be this bad, in my view.
[02:44:19.514 --> 02:44:32.358]  So I'm forced to totally throw my weight behind the Tea Party and proto-conservatives because, not that they're even perfect, but because the Democrats are the equivalent of metastasized cancer.
[02:44:33.078 --> 02:44:43.923]  Well Alex, once again, what's happening now is beyond the Tea Party because I think a lot of people are starting to understand that what we have here is a constitutional crisis.
[02:44:43.923 --> 02:44:58.150]  When the borders are being destroyed and our existing laws are not being enforced and the President of the United States is so far outside of his constitutional abilities, including what you mentioned earlier, the report that he's going to grant amnesty to 5 million illegal immigrants.
[02:44:58.430 --> 02:44:59.711]  Let me make this clear.
[02:44:59.711 --> 02:45:08.040]  Barack Obama does not have the constitutional authority to grant amnesty to any group of people.
[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:08.601]  No, he doesn't!
[02:45:08.601 --> 02:45:09.101]  He doesn't!
[02:45:09.101 --> 02:45:10.303]  So how is it happening?
[02:45:10.953 --> 02:45:12.635]  Well, he must be stopped.
[02:45:12.635 --> 02:45:14.617]  Now, our way to stop him is this.
[02:45:14.617 --> 02:45:25.129]  We feel that if we had a Speaker of the House that was actually his political opponent, instead of John Boehner, who is actively protecting President Obama... They're blackmailing Boehner, that's the word.
[02:45:25.129 --> 02:45:31.437]  But whatever his excuse, Mr. Pinktide's excuse is, I don't care what his excuse is.
[02:45:31.897 --> 02:45:39.967]  And anybody out there that doesn't understand what I'm saying yet, when I say that John Boehner is actively protecting President Obama, you need to get wise really fast.
[02:45:39.967 --> 02:45:41.288]  Is he hanging out with Lindsey Graham?
[02:45:42.304 --> 02:45:59.521]  Probably more ways than we'd like to think about, but there's probably what we think would happen here is if we had a Speaker of the House that was serious about his oath of office and his party and his principles, we would probably see a lot of Obama's abuses of power stop immediately.
[02:45:59.521 --> 02:46:00.121]  Oh, exactly!
[02:46:00.121 --> 02:46:02.984]  The Republican leadership is in bed giving him the green light.
[02:46:02.984 --> 02:46:05.506]  It's important to point out they are the real Benedict Arnolds.
[02:46:06.602 --> 02:46:17.371]  If the President does not restrain himself from further abuses of power, the forefathers of this nation, they built a clause into the Constitution.
[02:46:17.371 --> 02:46:19.453]  They built the remedy in there.
[02:46:19.453 --> 02:46:25.738]  And the remedy is to impeach the President, impeach the Vice President, down to the third in command, the Speaker of the House.
[02:46:25.738 --> 02:46:29.061]  And the Speaker of the House, make sure it's not some scellet like John Boehner.
[02:46:29.401 --> 02:46:35.209]  And the Speaker of the House comes out and says we've impeached the President for numerous crimes and abuses of power.
[02:46:35.209 --> 02:46:45.963]  We are now in control of all federal agencies, are under the control of the Congress, and will remain so for one year until we make sure all the politicos are kicked out and that all federal agencies of the United States government
[02:46:46.523 --> 02:46:46.764]  I think?
[02:47:02.645 --> 02:47:04.607]  Which the average person doesn't understand.
[02:47:04.607 --> 02:47:08.450]  Your power price is doubling, screws you over, shuts down factories.
[02:47:08.450 --> 02:47:11.373]  It's just, they literally want to destroy the country.
[02:47:11.373 --> 02:47:15.637]  Why would the elite that already runs the nation want to destroy their own engine?
[02:47:17.899 --> 02:47:20.701]  They don't want to destroy the whole country.
[02:47:20.701 --> 02:47:27.687]  They just want to destroy the kinds of people of all races that might be motivated by things they don't control.
[02:47:27.687 --> 02:47:40.316]  They like people who are motivated by the same thing as the market forces, fear and greed, and people who are nationalist-oriented or patriotic Americans or Christians or other religions and whatnot.
[02:47:41.477 --> 02:47:43.598]  Don't operate on just fear and greed.
[02:47:43.598 --> 02:47:56.404]  These are people, we are people that are operating on a set of principles and an understanding and a relationship between ourselves, God, and our government, and a government that was modeled after the reform, the Christian reform movements of Western Europe.
[02:47:56.404 --> 02:47:57.284]  Oh yeah, that's it.
[02:47:57.284 --> 02:48:00.186]  They want totally displaced, desperate people.
[02:48:00.486 --> 02:48:06.131]  That have no idea what's going on, who can become a total slave political class to be exploited.
[02:48:06.131 --> 02:48:13.637]  I mean, let's be clear, they're already exploiting these young people and these teenagers and these moms for all sorts of criminal operations.
[02:48:13.637 --> 02:48:16.179]  Man, I tell you, I tell you, the Democratic Party is a mafia.
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:30.746]  But you do that, they're doing that by bringing in people that have no shared national or cultural experience with us, that are willing to literally say or do anything that their new master is calling them to do to protect their position.
[02:48:30.746 --> 02:48:32.927]  Once Obama brings these kids in,
[02:48:33.447 --> 02:48:42.730]  Gives them their Obama phone, enrolls them in Obamacare, puts them in a public school, pays for their housing, pays for their food, and envelops them in the social care system.
[02:48:42.730 --> 02:48:49.032]  Moves them in with Democratic Party operatives, $6,000 a month, so it's like a Democratic foster care system.
[02:48:49.032 --> 02:48:58.575]  I think it goes way beyond Democratic political machinery, and I would contend that these people will do anything that their leaders call on them to do, and I do mean anything.
[02:48:59.448 --> 02:49:03.311]  Well, they admit that MS-13, these gangs, use these kids to kill people.
[02:49:03.311 --> 02:49:05.813]  That's now been confirmed.
[02:49:05.813 --> 02:49:06.713]  Fake IDs?
[02:49:06.713 --> 02:49:07.894]  Political cutouts?
[02:49:07.894 --> 02:49:09.755]  I mean, I've never seen anything.
[02:49:09.755 --> 02:49:15.079]  And then I saw cops on I-35 searching housewives with babies yesterday.
[02:49:15.079 --> 02:49:16.781]  Searching their cars with our borders open.
[02:49:17.481 --> 02:49:29.607]  The problem about trying to take up full gun confiscation and cracking down in a totalitarian fashion against American citizens is who amongst the country hates their fellow countrymen and women so much that you could turn to do that?
[02:49:29.607 --> 02:49:32.809]  They only have a small section of people that are willing to do that.
[02:49:32.809 --> 02:49:36.031]  And it's probably going to be the people that remain loyal to Obama to the very end.
[02:49:36.351 --> 02:49:49.007]  These people that come in, if they come to them and say, you must do this for your glorious leader or you're going back to the jungle and you've got to give the farm back and the food back and the free lodging back, they'll probably, a lot of them will make the decision to do about anything.
[02:49:49.007 --> 02:49:53.712]  But once again, the Constitution... That's like the African child slave soldiers.
[02:49:55.074 --> 02:49:59.536]  Well, they're not currently sworn to the United States Constitution.
[02:49:59.536 --> 02:50:01.357]  They don't seem to have any appreciation.
[02:50:01.357 --> 02:50:04.898]  That's how all those African countries are run, is off poor kids.
[02:50:04.898 --> 02:50:07.139]  They grab a 12 and give a machine gun to.
[02:50:07.139 --> 02:50:11.722]  Obama talks about his national security force just as big, just as strong as our military.
[02:50:11.722 --> 02:50:14.503]  It's so bold, but when you look at it, they really are doing that.
[02:50:15.003 --> 02:50:26.511]  Well, if we wanted to help these people and help their countries, the idea would be to export the things that have been great and work about America to them, but instead we're exporting the things that are wrong with their countries into ours.
[02:50:26.511 --> 02:50:31.054]  And that's clearly, and it's happening against the will of, like the polls you cited, 70, 80, 90% of Americans
[02:50:33.015 --> 02:50:41.919]  Of all races, all walks of life oppose this, and that's why they call you a racist and me a racist, because they want to try to put divisions in between us to stop you or me or anyone else.
[02:50:41.919 --> 02:50:43.079]  Well, this is going to hurt everybody.
[02:50:43.079 --> 02:50:44.300]  William Gein, Alipac.com.
[02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:47.001]  I want to get you back up again.
[02:50:47.001 --> 02:50:51.443]  The day of the demonstration or right before it, and we'll try to set something up here in Austin, Texas.
[02:50:51.443 --> 02:50:54.144]  We're going to come back in the final segment with some phone calls.
[02:50:54.144 --> 02:50:55.405]  Thank you so much for your time.
[02:50:55.405 --> 02:50:57.926]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:50:57.926 --> 02:50:58.526]  Stay with us.

[02:52:03.410 --> 02:52:05.831]  Curious about what comes next?
[02:52:05.831 --> 02:52:12.535]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars.
[02:52:12.535 --> 02:52:15.917]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[02:52:15.917 --> 02:52:22.401]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[02:52:22.401 --> 02:52:25.743]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[02:52:26.463 --> 02:52:31.789]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[02:52:31.789 --> 02:52:38.256]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[02:52:38.256 --> 02:52:43.081]  The new Brighter Fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.
[02:52:43.081 --> 02:52:45.684]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:52:48.587 --> 02:52:55.310]  That's 877-532-5388, or go to Faketv.com.
[02:52:55.310 --> 02:52:59.012]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[02:52:59.012 --> 02:53:01.793]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[02:53:01.793 --> 02:53:06.475]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[02:53:06.475 --> 02:53:08.677]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[02:53:13.899 --> 02:53:18.282]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[02:53:18.282 --> 02:53:20.263]  There's only 500 of each.
[02:53:20.263 --> 02:53:24.466]  We're talking about made in America belt buckles and nickel brass.
[02:53:24.466 --> 02:53:26.708]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[02:53:26.708 --> 02:53:29.610]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[02:53:29.830 --> 02:53:41.513]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[02:53:41.513 --> 02:53:45.355]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[02:53:45.355 --> 02:53:51.956]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[02:53:51.956 --> 02:53:56.998]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[02:54:10.936 --> 02:54:17.298]  My friends, as the third world continues its collapse thanks to globalist operations, that's a big part of it.
[02:54:17.298 --> 02:54:23.160]  We're going to be guilted and told we've got to accept the whole world here and pay for everything.
[02:54:23.160 --> 02:54:26.801]  And it'd be one thing if our government was well-meaning Christians or something.
[02:54:26.801 --> 02:54:31.142]  We still have to say no, because we obviously can't take the whole world.
[02:54:31.142 --> 02:54:39.745]  But instead, they're saying, you know, that they're doing this for everybody's own good, but it's being done to bankrupt the country and bring in total control.
[02:54:41.150 --> 02:54:44.331]  Briefly, just remember this is listener-supported radio.
[02:54:44.331 --> 02:54:57.855]  When you support our sponsors on the radio or at InfoWars.com, you support our local AM and FM sponsors by becoming a sponsor or supporting a local sponsor or letting that station know you're supporting that sponsor and spreading the word about the broadcast.
[02:54:57.855 --> 02:55:00.376]  That's how we reach more people.
[02:55:00.376 --> 02:55:09.039]  We've got a special running for three more days to get five plus months free when you sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv for a year membership.
[02:55:09.850 --> 02:55:12.632]  And you can always sign up for $5.95 a month.
[02:55:12.632 --> 02:55:18.958]  11 people can use the membership simultaneously with the same username.
[02:55:18.958 --> 02:55:35.232]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv, and we have more than 25% off on some of the clothes, but 25% off on most of them at MadeIn1776.com, our made-in-apparel site that is a subdirectory of InfowarsStore.com.
[02:55:37.045 --> 02:55:39.086]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[02:55:39.086 --> 02:55:41.028]  John, in California, thanks for holding.
[02:55:41.028 --> 02:55:42.869]  You're on the air.
[02:55:42.869 --> 02:55:44.050]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:55:44.050 --> 02:55:44.470]  Good, brother.
[02:55:44.470 --> 02:55:44.990]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:44.990 --> 02:55:45.951]  Go ahead.
[02:55:45.951 --> 02:55:51.014]  Yeah, you know, I just want to say that people are waking up now.
[02:55:51.014 --> 02:55:58.899]  You know, I'm in Southern California, the epitome of what you'd think would be a police state, but things are getting better.
[02:55:58.899 --> 02:56:05.844]  Just yesterday, I was driving down Tustin Avenue, you know, a big street, and I saw an impeach Obama stand.
[02:56:06.570 --> 02:56:11.011]  Yeah, the Hitler mustache is one of those, you know, and that was just great.
[02:56:11.011 --> 02:56:17.633]  And I think we just need to keep hammering it into people that, you know, Obama is not good.
[02:56:17.633 --> 02:56:22.515]  And that the Illuminati is trying to enslave us all.
[02:56:22.515 --> 02:56:27.176]  And they use our big hearts to guilt us into doing whatever they say.
[02:56:27.176 --> 02:56:30.917]  When if they cared about people in Mexico, they wouldn't be doing forced Gardasil shots.
[02:56:32.350 --> 02:56:37.213]  That doesn't even protect you from human papillomavirus and sterilizes you in many cases.
[02:56:37.213 --> 02:56:42.336]  And it's come out that it kills people, sterilizes them, autoimmune diseases.
[02:56:42.336 --> 02:56:45.018]  I mean, I don't want to kill Mexican children.
[02:56:45.018 --> 02:56:47.259]  I don't want to sterilize Mexican women.
[02:56:47.259 --> 02:56:51.422]  But I don't want to pay for them to have babies and watch them vote to take my guns.
[02:56:51.422 --> 02:56:52.903]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:56:52.903 --> 02:56:55.384]  Get off my back, I'll get off your back.
[02:56:55.384 --> 02:56:56.705]  Justice is what it's all about.
[02:56:57.671 --> 02:57:04.295]  And we got these MSNBC hosts, Melissa Harris Perry, saying you're a racist if you're not for open borders.
[02:57:04.295 --> 02:57:08.637]  She's a sickening, disgusting social engineer who knows full well what she's doing.
[02:57:08.637 --> 02:57:12.059]  She's a monster pig who hates this country.
[02:57:12.059 --> 02:57:13.279]  I appreciate your call, John.
[02:57:13.279 --> 02:57:17.122]  Phyllis in Texas, thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:57:17.122 --> 02:57:18.162]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:18.162 --> 02:57:19.483]  Go ahead.
[02:57:19.483 --> 02:57:20.143]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:20.143 --> 02:57:20.964]  Can you hear me?
[02:57:20.964 --> 02:57:21.524]  I sure can.
[02:57:23.027 --> 02:57:29.633]  Minister Jones, first I want to tell you I am one of your subscribers.
[02:57:29.633 --> 02:57:30.433]  Thank you.
[02:57:30.433 --> 02:57:32.595]  I am a patriot.
[02:57:32.595 --> 02:57:33.116]  Terrorist.
[02:57:33.116 --> 02:57:37.099]  I'm also a veteran, so by being a veteran that makes me a terrorist.
[02:57:37.099 --> 02:57:39.201]  Double terrorist, yes.
[02:57:39.201 --> 02:57:41.403]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:41.403 --> 02:57:45.807]  I am mad as hell.
[02:57:45.807 --> 02:57:48.169]  Terrorist.
[02:57:48.169 --> 02:57:50.391]  I do not like the idea
[02:57:51.147 --> 02:58:03.879]  That I'm sitting here in Texas, a hurricane comes up the coast, and illegal aliens are going to be set out of here before I get set out of here?
[02:58:03.879 --> 02:58:04.500]  That's right.
[02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:07.363]  Pretty soon they'll have somebody in there to wipe their butts for them.
[02:58:07.363 --> 02:58:08.184]  Racist.
[02:58:08.184 --> 02:58:09.645]  Exactly.
[02:58:09.645 --> 02:58:12.108]  And not only that... Hey, wait a minute.
[02:58:12.108 --> 02:58:13.169]  You're racist, fellas.
[02:58:13.169 --> 02:58:15.311]  Do you want to volunteer to wipe their butts?
[02:58:16.658 --> 02:58:16.818]  Hell no!
[02:58:16.818 --> 02:58:17.098]  No, hell no.
[02:58:17.098 --> 02:58:17.659]  I'm not going to wipe.
[02:58:17.659 --> 02:58:19.180]  Nobody else was stuck by my arm.
[02:58:19.180 --> 02:58:19.760]  Thank you very much.
[02:58:29.807 --> 02:58:31.429]  That's racist.
[02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:32.451]  Why are you racist?
[02:58:32.451 --> 02:58:35.234]  If you don't wipe the Queen of England's butt, you're racist.
[02:58:35.234 --> 02:58:35.975]  God bless you, fellas.
[02:58:35.975 --> 02:58:39.480]  We're gonna come back in Overdrive and talk to Bill, Michael, and MKUltra.
[02:58:39.480 --> 02:58:42.684]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[02:58:42.684 --> 02:58:45.007]  The story she's talking about is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:45.007 --> 02:58:45.368]  Stay with us.
[02:58:49.921 --> 02:58:52.144]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:58:52.144 --> 02:59:00.213]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:59:00.213 --> 02:59:07.322]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:59:07.722 --> 02:59:12.325]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:59:12.325 --> 02:59:22.951]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:59:22.951 --> 02:59:29.455]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:59:29.455 --> 02:59:32.017]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:59:32.017 --> 02:59:35.659]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.

[02:59:52.324 --> 02:59:54.385]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.385 --> 02:59:57.586]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.816 --> 03:00:07.136]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.136 --> 03:00:08.897]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:08.897 --> 03:00:10.657]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.657 --> 03:00:12.238]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.238 --> 03:00:13.798]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.798 --> 03:00:17.979]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.979 --> 03:00:26.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.221 --> 03:00:30.162]  Well, the feds aren't trying to get skilled workers here from Latin America.
[03:00:31.505 --> 03:00:33.187]  Or from China for that matter.
[03:00:33.187 --> 03:00:40.074]  They want political dissidents, criminals and folks that don't have any skills.
[03:00:40.074 --> 03:00:43.978]  Because they want dependents that they can control and use as pawns.
[03:00:43.978 --> 03:00:46.520]  That's the big emergency, we're talking about it.
[03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:50.124]  Bill in Arizona, thanks for calling, you're on the air.
[03:00:50.124 --> 03:00:51.365]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:00:51.365 --> 03:00:52.587]  Good, brother.
[03:00:52.587 --> 03:00:53.968]  Good, you can hear me?
[03:00:53.968 --> 03:00:54.468]  Loud and clear.
[03:00:55.299 --> 03:00:56.100]  Oh, perfect.
[03:00:56.100 --> 03:01:03.028]  Hey Alex, I just want to give a shout-out to my friends, fellow Freedom Fighters over there at Second On TV and my friend Purple Horror there.
[03:01:03.028 --> 03:01:14.380]  And I just wanted to call in and inspire your listeners and educate them about the Ftula Gulan movement and the Gulan Charter Schools infiltrating the United States.
[03:01:14.380 --> 03:01:15.381]  I'm not familiar with that.
[03:01:15.381 --> 03:01:16.262]  No, I'm not familiar.
[03:01:16.262 --> 03:01:16.503]  Tell me.
[03:01:17.148 --> 03:01:19.949]  Well, you've mentioned the Gladio A and the Gladio B project.
[03:01:19.949 --> 03:01:21.589]  Petula Gulan is a cult leader.
[03:01:21.589 --> 03:01:27.210]  He was very involved in that with Graham Fuller back in the 70s.
[03:01:27.210 --> 03:01:30.551]  He is one of our global elitists, worked over $25 billion.
[03:01:30.551 --> 03:01:42.214]  And right now, his cult now has over 130 charter schools across the United States, and they use it as a front to racketeer the money, to lobby our politicians.
[03:01:43.249 --> 03:01:46.690]  And to indoctrinate... Well, I'll have to look into that.
[03:01:46.690 --> 03:01:48.531]  I mean, there's all sorts of weird stuff going on.
[03:01:48.531 --> 03:01:49.931]  There's so much complexity in the world.
[03:01:49.931 --> 03:01:51.352]  How could you ever know about it all?
[03:01:51.352 --> 03:01:53.833]  I feel silly that I don't know about this.
[03:01:53.833 --> 03:01:54.733]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:01:54.733 --> 03:01:55.573]  Take a look into it.
[03:01:55.573 --> 03:01:59.215]  One of them was... 33 of those charter schools right there in Texas.
[03:01:59.215 --> 03:02:01.155]  One in Austin.
[03:02:01.155 --> 03:02:05.057]  They call it the Harmony School of Political Science.
[03:02:05.057 --> 03:02:08.238]  So they're trying to teach these young kids how to be politicians.
[03:02:09.226 --> 03:02:10.186]  Well, I know the U.N.
[03:02:10.186 --> 03:02:12.268]  already does that with their model U.N.
[03:02:12.268 --> 03:02:17.230]  All the best kids with the highest grades get sucked in to be part of the U.N.
[03:02:17.230 --> 03:02:19.231]  and indoctrinated in globalism.
[03:02:19.231 --> 03:02:20.211]  It's unbelievable.
[03:02:20.211 --> 03:02:23.413]  My first film, America Destroyed by Design, details that.
[03:02:23.413 --> 03:02:25.234]  Thank you so much, Bill.
[03:02:25.234 --> 03:02:27.975]  Let's talk to Michael in FEMA Region 9.
[03:02:27.975 --> 03:02:29.376]  What former state are you in?
[03:02:29.376 --> 03:02:33.598]  I am in the former state of Arizona up in the mountains.
[03:02:33.598 --> 03:02:33.938]  All right.
[03:02:33.938 --> 03:02:34.699]  Go ahead, extremist.
[03:02:35.678 --> 03:02:36.658]  Yes sir.
[03:02:36.658 --> 03:02:38.419]  Uh, Paris as well.
[03:02:38.419 --> 03:02:47.923]  Uh, I just want to put a word out to your listeners, our listeners, um, about, it's called the Border Convoy Rally.
[03:02:47.923 --> 03:02:54.246]  It begins this coming Saturday, which will be August 2nd, beginning in Murrieta, California.
[03:02:54.246 --> 03:03:03.530]  They're going to follow the border for a number of days, several days, five, six, seven days, or something like that, all the way down to McCallum, Texas.
[03:03:03.530 --> 03:03:03.910]  And, um,
[03:03:05.015 --> 03:03:08.279]  I wish I could go and be a part of it, but...
[03:03:24.147 --> 03:03:32.274]  This is about the government just opening the border without a law, encouraging the flood, acting like they're not doing it, keeping it secret they're busing them in.
[03:03:32.274 --> 03:03:33.094]  We expose that.
[03:03:33.094 --> 03:03:35.256]  I mean, this is about lawlessness.
[03:03:35.256 --> 03:03:39.379]  They can do anything they want right now because Congress won't stop them.
[03:03:39.379 --> 03:03:41.101]  Anything else, Michael?
[03:03:41.101 --> 03:03:48.927]  Yes, I just want to say I'm all for legal immigration because I do not have any... I'm not like you.
[03:03:48.927 --> 03:03:51.089]  My people didn't come over on the Mayflower.
[03:03:51.089 --> 03:03:52.850]  I don't have any history in this nation.
[03:03:54.133 --> 03:03:57.534]  Back as far as the Civil War.
[03:03:57.534 --> 03:04:06.378]  You know, I came over as immigrants in the early 20th century and thereabouts, but I just wanted to say that people can look up on Facebook.
[03:04:07.239 --> 03:04:10.562]  Type in Border Convoy Rally.
[03:04:10.562 --> 03:04:11.743]  Alright, I'll look into it.
[03:04:11.743 --> 03:04:12.764]  I appreciate it.
[03:04:12.764 --> 03:04:13.765]  We'll look into all of it.
[03:04:13.765 --> 03:04:14.606]  I'm almost out of time.
[03:04:14.606 --> 03:04:16.088]  Last caller, sorry to the others.
[03:04:16.088 --> 03:04:17.129]  MKUltra.
[03:04:17.129 --> 03:04:19.911]  That was a CIA mind control program that's declassified.
[03:04:19.911 --> 03:04:22.054]  Henceforth, it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:04:22.054 --> 03:04:23.435]  MKUltra, you're our tail gunner.
[03:04:23.435 --> 03:04:25.357]  Go ahead.
[03:04:25.357 --> 03:04:27.098]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:04:27.098 --> 03:04:28.099]  Two quick things.
[03:04:28.099 --> 03:04:31.683]  First thing, I know you always talk about how you're good at deciphering movies.
[03:04:32.592 --> 03:04:40.156]  Uh, I was wondering if you have time, of course, to try to check out mine, which I submitted to InfoWars competition, The Faceless Soldier.
[03:04:40.156 --> 03:04:40.737]  I'll look it up.
[03:04:40.737 --> 03:04:41.697]  The Faceless Soldier.
[03:04:41.697 --> 03:04:43.518]  Okay, what else?
[03:04:43.518 --> 03:04:47.981]  Especially with, uh, that dubstep article you ran over the weekend, how you're the king of reality.
[03:04:47.981 --> 03:04:49.641]  Really liked that.
[03:04:49.641 --> 03:04:55.685]  And then, secondly, uh, it's my birthday today, my golden birthday, and I was wondering if you can sing happy birthday to me.
[03:04:55.685 --> 03:04:57.766]  Happy birthday to MKUltra.
