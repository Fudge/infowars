[00:00.000 --> 00:17.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.520]  here we are ladies and gentlemen Friday hard to believe the 13th day of
[00:36.520 --> 00:44.100]  April 2018 and we're gonna be riding riding riding riding right through the
[00:44.100 --> 00:47.960]  next four hours than another three hours with Owen shroyer and Roger Stone in the
[00:47.960 --> 00:52.600]  war room that'll be it for this emergency 34-hour transmission stop
[00:52.600 --> 00:59.120]  world war with Russia and there have been some major signs that Trump is
[00:59.120 --> 01:06.880]  backing away from the tweets about Assad being a murderer with gas and being an
[01:06.880 --> 01:11.720]  animal and that our smart missiles were coming really didn't like that on
[01:11.720 --> 01:16.200]  Wednesday Pat Buchanan didn't like it either first thing Trump's really done
[01:16.200 --> 01:21.000]  that made Pat Buchanan want to throw up well yesterday Trump tweeted I never
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.160]  said I'm gonna strike Syria never said if I would never said if I wouldn't okay
[01:26.160 --> 01:29.040]  I like everything else Trump's doing and that was under attack I know I'm
[01:29.040 --> 01:33.400]  under massive attack for supporting him so I understand the globalist are
[01:33.400 --> 01:37.080]  really upset because he's mainly taking power away from them and transferring it
[01:37.080 --> 01:42.480]  back to the nation state out of the TPP out of the UN but that said there's
[01:42.480 --> 01:47.520]  other big signs that things are still cooking and if the neocons and globalists
[01:47.520 --> 01:50.800]  have already been caught staging three chemical attacks and now this fourth one
[01:50.800 --> 01:55.600]  appears to be staged and they sure try to get us to rush into war hours after
[01:55.600 --> 02:00.000]  it happened and have been beating that drum that we're all Russian agents we
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.880]  don't want World War three how dare Russia go defeat ISIS but still in the
[02:05.880 --> 02:11.720]  air the nuclear doomsday plane goes airborne as war fears grow e4b night
[02:11.720 --> 02:15.480]  watch allows us to maintain chain of command in the event of a major conflict
[02:15.480 --> 02:21.120]  and the airplanes are airborne right now there's nine of them and they are
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.880]  normally following the president around but on the ground except when they're
[02:24.880 --> 02:31.960]  following the president but once the death con goes up closer to thermal
[02:31.960 --> 02:35.800]  nuclear war they stay in the air at least part of them they can stay in the
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.840]  air for 150 hours that's what's admitted they're electromagnetically shielded so
[02:40.840 --> 02:46.560]  that they can take a newt going off just a few miles away that is a high-tech
[02:46.560 --> 02:50.720]  piece of equipment and undoubtedly one of the most expensive aircraft in the
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.200]  world and I've saw some foolish comments on info wars going how you're gonna run
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.240]  command and control with only 50 people on board it's the people in command back
[03:01.240 --> 03:04.040]  to folks on the ground doesn't mean the whole command and control is in the
[03:04.040 --> 03:11.280]  air there's a couple of AWACS can direct the whole attack of hundreds of jet
[03:11.280 --> 03:16.200]  aircraft sorties fighter bombers you name it but the fact that it's in the
[03:16.200 --> 03:21.200]  air that most of the nine planes are in the air that's classified but
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.440]  reportedly most of them are in the air they're being seen confirmed that some
[03:24.440 --> 03:31.720]  are in the air shows you that this is a serious situation correction I'd said
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.200]  nine planes there's 10 planes so we're gonna be breaking all of this down
[03:36.200 --> 03:41.320]  obviously Trump has come out and called call me a slime ball and the media is
[03:41.320 --> 03:47.000]  like how dare you call our gracious Lord our unelected bureaucracy you know
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.400]  the vice president of the deep state comey the president was McCain but his
[03:53.400 --> 03:57.240]  brain tumor so bad the president of the deep states now Robert Mueller the Lord
[03:57.240 --> 04:01.960]  and savior of the left and their unelected government how dare you when
[04:01.960 --> 04:07.360]  he went on national TV ABC comey and said I don't know of women hearing aid on
[04:07.360 --> 04:12.320]  the president might be true well how do we know comey it didn't get in the sur
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.560]  lines at night and eating big old piles of crap I mean I don't know if it's true
[04:16.560 --> 04:24.000]  maybe comey's a child molester maybe comey snorts doesn't fed him in off
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.680]  hookers rear ends I mean none of that's probably true but you could there and say
[04:27.680 --> 04:32.680]  it but you're saying about the president you dirtbag on television when
[04:32.680 --> 04:36.120]  that whole PP gate thing was what was paid for by you and your buddies at the
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.840]  Justice Department illegally sending money to the head of the Justice
[04:40.840 --> 04:46.160]  Department's operations wife at the Fusion GPS you people have no shame in
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.000]  the deep states fighting for its life we're winning but we're in the thick of
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.040]  battle so cry have it let loose the dogs of the info war and let them have it
[04:55.040 --> 05:07.200]  that means press the attack don't think about who's winning attack
[05:25.400 --> 05:31.280]  Gregory Brower reads all FBI employees must maintain a top secret security
[05:31.280 --> 05:34.760]  clearance on a Fox News appearance senator Paul warned that this
[05:34.760 --> 05:39.000]  potentially means that the exposed officials who called Trump an idiot and
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.600]  a loathsome human and talked about an FBI secret society and an insurance
[05:43.600 --> 05:48.280]  policy for if Trump was elected can still access information regarding the
[05:48.280 --> 05:52.440]  investigation posing a potential threat to national security Paul said Peter
[05:52.440 --> 05:56.400]  struck and Lisa Page were exposed as enemies of President Trump and they
[05:56.400 --> 06:01.240]  need to be fired Lee and Macadoo info wars.com
[06:01.240 --> 06:23.640]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on your mind
[06:32.000 --> 06:42.840]  you are tuned into either on radio or broadcast television cable television or
[06:42.840 --> 06:51.640]  internet streams or by podcast later to the most hated multimedia news
[06:51.640 --> 07:04.800]  transmission in the world most hated most infamous most dreaded by globalist by
[07:04.800 --> 07:11.680]  tyrants by authoritarians by child molesters by devil worshipers by
[07:11.680 --> 07:21.880]  control freaks by scumbags by fascist by criminals take comedy central and its
[07:21.880 --> 07:29.400]  stupid no ratings show that they admit is completely based on me and the sets
[07:29.400 --> 07:33.120]  and everything trying to rip off our office so they can then misrepresent
[07:33.120 --> 07:39.000]  who we are with fake satire and then they come up and confront me on the street
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.200]  with total hatred and disdain shaking in their petty want to be elitist
[07:44.200 --> 07:51.840]  behavior think about that you steal somebody's identity you got a fake news
[07:51.840 --> 07:58.680]  show hiding behind comedy and then four nights a week you have a program
[07:58.680 --> 08:10.440]  misrepresenting your prey that's what they do and then they make the joke oh
[08:10.440 --> 08:20.840]  Alex Jones is a crisis actor and then say how dare you say no children died at
[08:20.840 --> 08:31.560]  Sandy Hook and at Aurora and at Parkland and then I explain in the raw
[08:31.560 --> 08:38.080]  video that son in fours.com where I actually stand on that and that I had
[08:38.080 --> 08:42.000]  debates about it on both sides because we've seen media stage events before and
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.960]  that I do believe people died at Sandy Hook but that PR bandwagon's jumped on
[08:47.960 --> 08:53.160]  it and took control of it and didn't let a good crisis go to waste but even when
[08:53.160 --> 08:56.200]  I told Megan Kelly that last year even when I said that on there three years
[08:56.200 --> 09:01.280]  ago or put out a quote final message two years ago the media will never pick up
[09:01.280 --> 09:07.640]  what I actually say because they think it's a weakness point with me because
[09:07.640 --> 09:12.000]  they believe I changed my stance on it which I never really did but see that
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.920]  shows how they know I tell the truth and so their whole world is about distorting
[09:19.920 --> 09:30.200]  that truth that's their program and and they're not important enough to sit
[09:30.200 --> 09:37.440]  there and even talk about but it's another indicator on our digital readout
[09:37.440 --> 09:44.280]  of life here of just how upset Viacom that brought us the nightmare of MTV and
[09:44.280 --> 09:53.680]  the cultural pollution of gangster rap and all the force-fed garbage this is a
[09:53.680 --> 10:00.520]  Sumner Redstone hate letter to America with a bunch of elitist and
[10:00.520 --> 10:11.440]  talentless mercenaries attempting to demonize the American opposition to
[10:11.440 --> 10:19.600]  being colonized by global corporations so it's a badge of honor that these
[10:19.600 --> 10:25.640]  scumbags attack me but when I finally watched a segment of the show I've
[10:25.640 --> 10:31.520]  only seen little clips before because I just it's it's it's just they act so
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.120]  conceited like a bunch of frat boys a bunch of arrested development people
[10:37.120 --> 10:44.120]  that I just can't watch it the left fopping around acting smart acting
[10:44.120 --> 10:54.520]  snarky and then heavily editing all of it to misrepresent what I've said and
[10:54.520 --> 10:59.440]  what I've done and and I'm not stupid I can see the media building their
[10:59.440 --> 11:11.000]  crescendo to have families of the Sandy Hook victims assuming and and that's
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.760]  what this production is these productions of the quote comedy shows are
[11:14.760 --> 11:21.640]  directed by the Democratic Party Colbert admits it Jimmy Kimmel admits it look it
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.200]  out they had daily conversations with Chuck E. Schumer with Hillary Clinton
[11:25.200 --> 11:32.680]  they helped direct what it's about and so they wanted put the false idea out to
[11:32.680 --> 11:37.400]  the public that Alex Jones attacks children and that you can't ever
[11:37.400 --> 11:45.160]  question any big public event and it's all part of the PR rollout to brand
[11:45.160 --> 11:51.040]  opposition to world government and tyranny and globalism as evil so that
[11:51.040 --> 11:55.080]  other people are intimidated from being involved in the movement to restore the
[11:55.080 --> 11:59.600]  country sovereignty its prosperity and its freedom Hollywood and the globalist
[11:59.600 --> 12:06.640]  are a cancer at the heart of this nation other nations openly at war with the
[12:06.640 --> 12:12.240]  family openly at war with success openly at war with independence openly at
[12:12.240 --> 12:23.400]  war with any form of freedom like every other authoritarian that has come down
[12:23.400 --> 12:30.960]  the road in history like every other authoritarian system so I'm done talking
[12:30.960 --> 12:39.520]  about that it's just incredible to see them do edits every two seconds and then
[12:39.520 --> 12:46.920]  the stage part of what happened by watching the video I could tell that to
[12:46.920 --> 12:49.800]  see that they shot parts of it when actually wasn't even there it would just
[12:49.800 --> 12:53.040]  turn the camera on the street and have the guy talk as if he made those
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.120]  statements to me because I was saying Chuck E. Cheese the rat over and over
[12:58.120 --> 13:03.360]  again knowing the power of memes so that we can dub that particular reporter I
[13:03.360 --> 13:08.920]  forget his name Chuck E. Cheese the rat because he's like an animatronic rat he
[13:08.920 --> 13:12.880]  said don't try to give me brain force like I'm a gerbil and I said you don't
[13:12.880 --> 13:16.560]  like a gerbil you like Chuck E. Cheese the rat animatronic rat plus you're a
[13:16.560 --> 13:25.000]  puppet it's a perfect archetype but when you see the shaking hate that the
[13:25.000 --> 13:31.000]  host the show has and his minions have it's because the funding for all of these
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.000]  shows has been cut 60 70% there are massive layoffs throughout mainstream
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.760]  media throughout Hollywood throughout all the corporate press the stuff that
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.360]  Bezos is propping up at the Washington Post is about to implode I can tell you
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.920]  that very soon inside baseball the New York Times been bankrupt for a long
[13:52.920 --> 14:04.040]  long time propped up by Carlos Slim the Middle Eastern Mexican Kingpin and so
[14:04.040 --> 14:09.080]  these folks are at war with the country they want to dominate us like all other
[14:09.080 --> 14:16.760]  strong men do and they find a feminine metrosexual culture to be the best
[14:16.760 --> 14:22.040]  poison to kill manhood the family and chivalry so remember how they talk
[14:22.040 --> 14:25.360]  behind the scenes about bitter clingers and flyover country and Hillary
[14:25.360 --> 14:30.840]  publicly says she hates the Midwest and she hates her constituents and hates how
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.520]  they're baristas and want all this free stuff and she can't supply it they are
[14:34.520 --> 14:39.360]  the ruling corrupt class that launched wars and Arab Springs and all of it and
[14:39.360 --> 14:47.040]  the camp follower left all went and got two or three worthless degrees at these
[14:47.040 --> 14:50.520]  colleges and there aren't jobs there is an industry there's not even media jobs
[14:50.520 --> 14:58.040]  and so only the most aggressive hate-filled sycophantic gremlin-like
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.640]  servants of the globalist agenda are hired and they scrabble and claw like
[15:03.640 --> 15:08.320]  stelter and the rest of them and you see the manifestation of the bottom of the
[15:08.320 --> 15:15.600]  barrel of just repulsive looking I don't mean even how they look but they're
[15:15.600 --> 15:21.160]  they're mannerisms they're the the look in their eyes the things they say they
[15:21.160 --> 15:28.960]  do these are horrible fallen twisted truly deranged individuals who cannot
[15:28.960 --> 15:34.120]  stand your strength they cannot stand your honor they cannot stand your will
[15:34.120 --> 15:38.440]  and they want to break you so bad because then if they could break America and
[15:38.440 --> 15:41.360]  if they can target Christians and if they can make all the young people
[15:41.360 --> 15:45.160]  depressed under their control they can rule over the pile of garbage they
[15:45.160 --> 15:49.720]  create but only by pulling down the world can they rule that is their spirit

[21:40.680 --> 21:48.160]  Trump fired him and said you'll regret this and watch your mouth that the
[21:48.160 --> 21:54.080]  bureaucracy it's like you it's like you're 35 years old 40 years old you
[21:54.080 --> 21:57.160]  get home your 16 year old son or daughter's at a party when you left for

[22:11.280 --> 22:16.720]  Brennan's like an old Wahhabist on the payroll of the last regime in Saudi
[22:16.720 --> 22:20.360]  Arabia and Trump's rolling all that up you know I said that's coming up the
[22:20.360 --> 22:25.800]  next segment let me get to that next segment since I since I've mentioned it
[22:25.800 --> 22:29.680]  and then I'm gonna get more again into the collapse of the media what you're
[22:29.680 --> 22:34.720]  seeing is mainstream media trying to pull new independent media the free open
[22:34.720 --> 22:39.640]  internet conservatism nationalism populism common sense free market
[22:39.640 --> 22:47.080]  behavior really just survival instinct they're trying to pull survival
[22:47.080 --> 22:53.960]  instinct into the mentally ill grave with them you get around leftist they all
[22:53.960 --> 22:57.240]  grew up massive cities and tiny apartments most of them didn't have
[22:57.240 --> 23:01.680]  daddies at home even if they're really an alpha in their behavior and their
[23:01.680 --> 23:06.760]  genetics they have a beta complex where they want to dominate everybody and
[23:06.760 --> 23:12.920]  they're all very neurotic very hateful very very alone very sociopathic very
[23:12.920 --> 23:18.480]  psychopathic and the statistics show that the left again six times more likely
[23:18.480 --> 23:24.760]  to steal nine times more likely to not give the charity in the entire world
[23:24.760 --> 23:28.440]  same studies look them up yourself type in the left is more stingy commits more
[23:28.440 --> 23:31.960]  crimes that's in major liberal universities and they go we don't know
[23:31.960 --> 23:39.760]  why because you're trash that's why your scum you hate everybody so you pose as
[23:39.760 --> 23:43.680]  a nice person so you can manipulate people that have morals under your
[23:43.680 --> 23:50.720]  control so you can misrepresent who we are and try to guilt us all day well
[23:50.720 --> 23:54.600]  it's time to stop letting them to find how to talk and what to do and what a
[23:54.600 --> 23:59.120]  family is and what words to use and in Europe they arrest people now to
[23:59.120 --> 24:02.880]  criticize Islam they arrest people that said there's only two genders these
[24:02.880 --> 24:08.520]  people mean business they're easy to defeat if people just wake up and take
[24:08.520 --> 24:15.440]  action now I'm gonna come back with Comey and all the rest of it and Trump
[24:15.440 --> 24:22.360]  calling him a slime ball in the next segment but right now we are 20 what
[24:22.360 --> 24:28.160]  28 hours into the worldwide emergency stop world war with Russia
[24:28.160 --> 24:36.240]  transmission and if you're watching or listening on the radio however you're
[24:36.240 --> 24:42.560]  tuned in it is beyond imperative it is absolutely essential that you spread the
[24:42.560 --> 24:46.120]  live links the articles the videos if you want to crush the globalist they
[24:46.120 --> 24:49.880]  fear this transmission because we have the enemy blueprint and we have the
[24:49.880 --> 24:53.840]  blueprint of prosperity to challenge it with and all over the world every
[24:53.840 --> 24:57.400]  election is going against the globalist except for the few they're
[24:57.400 --> 25:01.720]  stealing here in the US so we're facing their full counterattack like Battle of
[25:01.720 --> 25:06.120]  the Bulls here they're the Nazis where the allies they're led by a Nazi
[25:06.120 --> 25:11.720]  collaborator and the and the whole corrupt arm of the Vatican that helped
[25:11.720 --> 25:15.000]  Hitler and then the EU's run by the grandson of the head of the Nazi war
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.440]  machine and the reason I mentioned that is they're always calling us Nazis
[25:19.440 --> 25:26.080]  because they are the the money and the and the inclination and the will of
[25:26.080 --> 25:30.960]  what was left of the Nazis and the whole Rockefeller Nazi project Adolf Hitler
[25:30.960 --> 25:43.160]  was a product of IBM and a product of the Rockefeller Foundation on record
[25:43.160 --> 25:50.440]  IBM and the Rockefellers commanded Hitler and they set him up Hitler was a
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.800]  bad guy they set him up he had a treaty with the King of England England was
[25:54.800 --> 25:57.000]  gonna stand down that's why he didn't take out the British troops at Dunkirk
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.600]  they were just supposed to evacuate and leave you cannot make up the you

[26:15.560 --> 26:21.040]  admitted Nazi collaborator the EU is run by the hereditary heir to the Nazi
[26:21.040 --> 26:29.280]  fortune who still owns countries himself Luxembourg like you know granddaddy took
[26:29.280 --> 26:32.120]  it over with Hitler so you get it and then you're the head of the unelected
[26:32.120 --> 26:38.440]  EU a Nazi project this is reality they just laugh at me and they've always got
[26:38.440 --> 26:42.160]  that like little fake intellectual little hairstyles and they and they're

[33:47.320 --> 33:52.040]  over nation states using their taxes their resources their people their
[33:52.040 --> 33:57.560]  will to dominate other nations America has been under globalist exploitation
[33:57.560 --> 34:01.360]  for more than 60 years building a private corporate empire for ruthless
[34:01.360 --> 34:04.600]  individuals they've taken over our industry they've taken over our
[34:04.600 --> 34:08.600]  religious institutions they've taken over the banks they've taken over the
[34:08.600 --> 34:16.200]  higher education and they have produced an anti-human eugenics based post
[34:16.200 --> 34:22.320]  industrial technocracy that is authoritarian in the Debo's group and
[34:22.320 --> 34:31.080]  the EU's own words but they hope that they can confuse you and lie to you on
[34:31.080 --> 34:35.680]  CNN and MSNBC and then if you're the 20% that actually cares about even mainstream
[34:35.680 --> 34:42.640]  news or if you're the 80% to get your news from comedy shows well they sit
[34:42.640 --> 34:48.120]  there and condescend and edit and pray on you they know you're a mark they know
[34:48.120 --> 34:53.480]  they're targeting you they revel in their hatred for you and your family
[34:53.480 --> 34:57.200]  when I when I say that folks you've heard the recordings you've seen the
[34:57.200 --> 35:02.520]  spirit to be bad and to do this kind of stuff to people you have to get into it
[35:02.520 --> 35:06.640]  they're into it they're like why would a serial killer grab little kids out of
[35:06.640 --> 35:09.880]  the backs of their backyards and take them into dungeons and torture them and
[35:09.880 --> 35:14.760]  rape them for months because a little child begging for mommy and screaming is
[35:14.760 --> 35:19.400]  called beautiful music to a psychopath to a Satanist raping them torturing them
[35:19.400 --> 35:24.280]  gouging their eyeballs out as they pray for mommy and mommy never coming that
[35:24.280 --> 35:31.760]  makes them feel good and so to a lesser extent you've got the cowardly
[35:31.760 --> 35:37.840]  psychopaths in establishment media that can't get away with stuff like that but
[35:37.840 --> 35:43.520]  if they can push gender confusion and teach your five-year-old boy that he's
[35:43.520 --> 35:51.400]  a chop his genitals off and screw him up that's a big vampiric win if they can
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.440]  make you take on a whole new language of total mental illness like a tower to
[35:55.440 --> 35:58.720]  Babel where no one can even communicate and where mother and father male and
[35:58.720 --> 36:05.760]  female are a crime they win it's called depopulation okay let's go ahead and get

[36:25.760 --> 36:29.720]  breaks it all down that these are only airborne when the death con moves up
[36:29.720 --> 36:35.120]  towards the chance of a nuclear war and of course if you strike Russian forces
[36:35.120 --> 36:40.840]  preemptively they can then strike you and then it goes tit for tot and you're
[36:40.840 --> 36:46.280]  into a major war perhaps even a nuclear war and all the top analysts of Russia
[36:46.280 --> 36:52.520]  studies in the US in Europe and in in in Russia and we've had many of them on the
[36:52.520 --> 36:56.360]  fact we've had Princeton University professor on before I have other
[36:56.360 --> 37:00.840]  professors on as well professor emeritus of Russian studies at Princeton
[37:00.840 --> 37:04.560]  University and New York University Stephen Cohen told Tucker Carlson last
[37:04.560 --> 37:08.840]  night he is more worried than he's ever been at the prospect of nuclear war
[37:08.840 --> 37:15.120]  Russia here let's just hear from him more worried than I've ever been for
[37:15.120 --> 37:20.360]  nearly 50 years of studying and participating in US-Russian relations I
[37:20.360 --> 37:26.080]  think the situation your generation was born after the Cuban Missile Crisis but
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.000]  you were taught the school as were my children that the Cuban Missile Crisis
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.760]  of 1962 was the moment when we came closest ever to nuclear war with Russia
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.520]  and the learned lesson was supposed to be we should never get there again and
[37:40.520 --> 37:46.680]  we are very close and here's why if Trump or somebody sends these missiles
[37:46.680 --> 37:53.840]  against Syria there are Russian soldiers embedded in almost all Syrian Army
[37:53.840 --> 37:59.840]  units even in dormitories if and this I know because Moscow has said so if
[37:59.840 --> 38:07.040]  Russians die if Damascus is attacked the capital of Syria Russia will retaliate
[38:07.040 --> 38:11.200]  with its excellent weapons every bit as good as ours some people say in some
[38:11.200 --> 38:16.880]  regards in missile technology better Russia will strike Americans in Syria
[38:16.880 --> 38:22.920]  will die and we will be where we have never ever ever been with Russia killing
[38:22.920 --> 38:29.280]  each other bearing in mind that both nations are laden with nuclear weapons
[38:29.280 --> 38:34.360]  so I am more worried than I have ever been in my life at least since the Cuban
[38:34.360 --> 38:39.720]  Missile Crisis but that's okay because the mainstream media only wants parents
[38:39.720 --> 38:43.520]  to stand down and let the school teach your children about their sexuality and
[38:43.520 --> 38:49.880]  try to get them to change their sex I remember 30 years ago or longer now in
[38:49.880 --> 38:57.240]  high school hardly the old I am now you had to sign a form but your parents
[38:57.240 --> 38:59.920]  didn't let you go to health class because they'd show you you know footage of
[38:59.920 --> 39:05.960]  gonorrhea and stuff like that in health class but I remember thinking oh yeah
[39:05.960 --> 39:09.400]  you know I wasn't really a leftist but I thought all these goody-to-shoe right
[39:09.400 --> 39:12.800]  wingers why are they afraid of the school being involved in sex education
[39:12.800 --> 39:15.800]  this makes sense for us to know these things you know my dad was a physician
[39:15.800 --> 39:18.760]  sorry have been taught a lot of things I thought it was normal didn't have info
[39:18.760 --> 39:22.080]  but I didn't realize in other schools around the country that very time they
[39:22.080 --> 39:25.800]  were already in New York and other areas teaching seven-year-olds how to
[39:25.800 --> 39:30.000]  perform anal sex and do things I can't even say and using it as a way to
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.240]  corrupt them and now hell they're telling five-year-olds you're not a boy
[39:33.240 --> 39:35.880]  you're not a girl you'll be something else you're a little girl and these
[39:35.880 --> 39:39.600]  liberal women want to abuse their sons as Camille Pagley has said as a
[39:39.600 --> 39:44.240]  sacrament of attacking manhood to raise little soy boys that's what they give
[39:44.240 --> 39:51.720]  them no meat no nothing just soy it's a religion the man's never there and
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.840]  again they're passing bathroom bills where anybody going to bathroom they want
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.160]  and Como you know says well if your daughter doesn't like seeing a man's
[40:00.160 --> 40:06.240]  genitals in a shower at school she's a bigot imagine a full that they want full
[40:06.240 --> 40:09.880]  grown adult men to go in the showers with your ten-year-olds and you're a
[40:09.880 --> 40:13.920]  bigot see once it's you're a bigot give us your rights give us your speech give
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.480]  us your children give it give it give it they know what they're doing they're
[40:17.480 --> 40:23.080]  asking for the stars they're asking for a trillion miles they don't care they
[40:23.080 --> 40:27.400]  only get 500 billion but here's the deal they're getting what they want because
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.800]  these schools and facilities are cults and everyone wants to one up the next
[40:31.800 --> 40:40.720]  person you imagine they said if your daughter doesn't want to see a full
[40:40.720 --> 40:47.880]  grown man the example was a the news article about they're gonna have
[40:47.880 --> 40:52.640]  transgendered men that they're women in public schools showering with your
[40:52.640 --> 40:58.240]  daughters they said you know the coach or whatever and Como said big deal that's
[40:58.240 --> 41:03.880]  a good thing so we've got all this potential nuclear war all the rest of it
[41:03.880 --> 41:07.600]  going on but none of that matters Joy Behar says Kim Jong-un and Putin have
[41:07.600 --> 41:13.360]  more sanity than Trump so now they can get their story straight they love the
[41:13.360 --> 41:18.800]  total dictator who's killed millions of people Putin is elected but they say he
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.320]  secretly runs Trump but now Putin has more sanity these leftist can't even
[41:23.320 --> 41:26.960]  get their BS straight here's Joy Behar
[41:26.960 --> 41:32.280]  we have to rely on the sanity of Kim Jong-un and Putin over the president of
[41:32.280 --> 41:36.800]  the United States that's where we're at we're hoping because here's one of the
[41:36.800 --> 41:40.720]  Russian Prime Minister one of the guys over there said we do not do diplomacy
[41:40.720 --> 41:47.800]  by tweet yeah thank you thank you this isn't even congruent arguments he's
[41:47.800 --> 41:52.720]  saying come talk to us stop threatening us it's the threatening thing that's bad
[41:52.720 --> 41:56.520]  but see they want him to shut up oh when Trump has a platform it's bad though
[41:56.520 --> 42:01.440]  Behar's got her ABC show see how there's all agendas here here it is
[42:01.440 --> 42:06.440]  what makes me nervous is that I don't know that this president is able to
[42:06.440 --> 42:10.640]  compartmentalize things in the way that a president should so when he has all
[42:10.640 --> 42:15.240]  this Stormy Daniel stuff in there and his personal attorneys you know law firm
[42:15.240 --> 42:20.560]  and home being rated by the FBI I just wonder if that is agitating him so much
[42:20.560 --> 42:24.640]  does he then lean towards making emotional decision was famous for being
[42:24.640 --> 42:37.880]  able to cook to compartmentalize things Monica Lewinsky Syria yeah guys and
[42:37.880 --> 42:40.360]  gentlemen who do you think's putting the pressure on the president it's these
[42:40.360 --> 42:45.920]  people and those harpies perched up there betting on America to fail because
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.560]  they're globalists they're the elites that perch on you they know it they talk
[42:50.560 --> 42:55.600]  about it they enjoy it they hate you because they're traitorous sacks of
[42:55.600 --> 43:00.840]  garbage never forget they are your enemy did president Trump nearly fire
[43:00.840 --> 43:05.520]  special counsel Robert Mueller in December 2017 after the publication of
[43:05.520 --> 43:09.280]  some fake news according to a New York Times article published this week
[43:09.280 --> 43:13.440]  Trump told advisors to fire Mueller following reports the special counsel's
[43:13.440 --> 43:17.280]  office subpoenaed his bank records the Times reported that Trump believed the
[43:17.280 --> 43:21.520]  subpoenas crossed a red line he'd set for the Muller probe the stories about the
[43:21.520 --> 43:25.160]  bank subpoenas which appeared in the Wall Street Journal Reuters and Bloomberg
[43:25.160 --> 43:28.960]  turned out to be inaccurate and the outlets issued a correction noting the
[43:28.960 --> 43:32.840]  subpoenas were for bank records of Trump associates this week the president
[43:32.840 --> 43:36.960]  tweeted if I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December as reported by the
[43:36.960 --> 43:41.440]  failing New York Times I would have fired him just more fake news from a
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.080]  biased newspaper and this isn't the first time that the New York Times has
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.600]  reported that the president considered firing Muller the Times reported that
[43:48.600 --> 43:52.560]  the president demanded White House counsel Don McGahn fire Muller in June
[43:52.560 --> 43:56.840]  2017 but Trump backed down after McGahn threatened to resign

[47:36.080 --> 47:42.680]  into Trump this is a bureaucratic position put in there by Obama who was
[47:42.680 --> 47:46.640]  caught illegally spying on the candidate Trump president elect Trump and
[47:46.640 --> 47:51.480]  then president Trump right up until the time Trump fired him under the orders of
[47:51.480 --> 48:03.240]  Obama and John O. Brennan thinks he's got former CIA director John Brennan the
[48:03.240 --> 48:06.640]  guy that was a lobbyist the guy that's been caught lying to Congress just like
[48:06.640 --> 48:13.560]  clappers in the news saying Trump's bad why do we have clapper on the news
[48:13.560 --> 48:17.160]  clapper got caught lying to Congress saying the NSA's never spied on one
[48:17.160 --> 48:22.840]  American and the moon's also made of cheese and there's not only two genders
[48:22.840 --> 48:26.320]  there's five million former CIA director John Brennan on Friday went after
[48:26.320 --> 48:29.240]  president Trump over his attacks on former FBI director James Comey
[48:29.240 --> 48:34.840]  tweeting that Trump's cacostocracy is collapsing after its lamentable
[48:34.840 --> 48:43.120]  journey now let's compare reality here four plus trillion the stock market
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.560]  extra they've only knocked off a trillion so three trillion two million new

[48:52.960 --> 48:56.200]  new companies coming back to the country Trump fighting back against the
[48:56.200 --> 49:01.200]  lopsided trade deficit killing TPP some say he's flip-flopping no he said I'm
[49:01.200 --> 49:04.480]  taking us out of it and killing an office it's an unfair agreement we can
[49:04.480 --> 49:10.000]  renegotiate it later and we'll do it unilaterally nation to nation won't be
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.440]  secret that's what he always said they said he flip-flop that's one way they
[49:14.440 --> 49:18.720]  attack him through the right wing people want to score fake points when
[49:18.720 --> 49:22.000]  Trump does something wrong I'll get into it but I am in the guts of this I am in
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.640]  the facts of this I'll get into that next hour that's a whole other issue let
[49:26.640 --> 49:31.680]  me get back to this it's just like DACA or it's just like the guns he'll say oh
[49:31.680 --> 49:36.200]  yeah tell me what you want whatever you want not saying it's gonna pass but tell
[49:36.200 --> 49:41.280]  me what you want fine Stein rubbed her hands together like a rat meets the
[49:41.280 --> 49:45.680]  wicked witch of the east and says well we want to repeal the Second Amendment
[49:45.680 --> 49:53.040]  and he goes okay well mmm thank you for showing your hand baby he did it on
[49:53.040 --> 49:57.640]  DACA they got nothing he said during the campaign he said yeah there might be a
[49:57.640 --> 50:00.760]  million people been here for decades no criminal record let's accelerate them
[50:00.760 --> 50:03.720]  getting their citizenship but if you have been here over and over again you've
[50:03.720 --> 50:08.760]  been deported you have a criminal record you're gone what a joke the media said he
[50:08.760 --> 50:13.760]  hates Mexicans it says they're all scum there's no video of it he didn't say it
[50:13.760 --> 50:23.840]  just like I didn't say there's Martian slave bases very very very very very
[50:23.840 --> 50:30.960]  fake news this is what they do but they say it enough so you're supposed to
[50:30.960 --> 50:38.920]  believe it so it's amazing now I want to get to Comey's incredible behavior on
[50:38.920 --> 50:44.920]  ABC they analyze this Comey talks about briefing Trump on the steel dossier the
[50:44.920 --> 50:50.760]  fusion GPS where the head of the Russia operation of the just department
[50:50.760 --> 50:55.280]  struck well that that was the FBI of the head of the just department operation
[50:55.280 --> 51:00.720]  gave his wife the contract she only went to work at fusion GPS for the
[51:00.720 --> 51:06.840]  Russia gate dossier it's a pure fiction it's admitted to not be true they don't
[51:06.840 --> 51:15.360]  care he just gets up and says well I don't know if people peed on him you
[51:15.360 --> 51:19.720]  also don't know if he flies around on Christmas Eve with Santa Claus and root
[51:19.720 --> 51:25.320]  off the red-nosed reindeer and Dasher and Blitzen to comment and all the rest of
[51:25.320 --> 51:30.040]  them I mean you can't say that Trump doesn't fly around on Christmas Eve with
[51:30.040 --> 51:34.520]  Santa Claus you can't say that he had to secretly have a little forked tail
[51:34.520 --> 51:38.200]  either you can't say that Trump didn't drink and baby blood at night but we all
[51:38.200 --> 51:41.600]  know that's really the globalist and leftist and all their Alistair Crowley
[51:41.600 --> 51:49.760]  crap that they publicly admit they do so there you go we know it's the Clintons
[51:49.760 --> 51:54.640]  and Epstein and the Lolita Express and the kidnapped kids but none of that
[51:54.640 --> 51:58.200]  matters it didn't matter what's in the wiki leaks it's who got them and the
[51:58.200 --> 52:02.600]  whole story becomes that and the media parrots that until even those of us that
[52:02.600 --> 52:05.400]  are awake finally focus on what they're saying they still have the power to
[52:05.400 --> 52:11.080]  bully us and to beat a dead horse to death until just by rhythmic motion
[52:11.560 --> 52:18.640]  oh they get us in into a trance of yes and then we debate that we're not
[52:18.640 --> 52:22.240]  Russians instead of what are you talking about you're the ones in the
[52:22.240 --> 52:25.080]  wiki leaks commit the crimes let's remember that so I think every day we
[52:25.080 --> 52:28.560]  should start publishing articles about remember this wiki leak remember that
[52:28.560 --> 52:33.600]  wiki leak maybe we should write a new article about it's about what's in the
[52:33.600 --> 52:36.800]  wiki leak stupid and put that out and hopefully drudge would link to it and
[52:36.800 --> 52:41.600]  relist the hundred top wiki leaks remember that we'll have the kids for
[52:41.600 --> 52:46.520]  entertainment in the hot tub we'll have the Alistair Crowley preparation with
[52:46.520 --> 52:56.720]  blood and semen ready sir so there you go ladies and gentlemen but let's go
[52:56.720 --> 53:03.880]  ahead and go to hair combing and just listen to this trying to push a book
[53:03.880 --> 53:07.480]  and then Trump says you're a slime ball the articles on info wars.com and
[53:07.480 --> 53:13.360]  news wars.com and the media is like oh my god been shooting the FBI how dare you

[53:50.400 --> 53:58.280]  call him dear leader Mueller dear vice leader combing and let's go to lord
[53:58.280 --> 54:03.160]  combing here it is well about to meet with a person who doesn't know me it's
[54:03.160 --> 54:08.760]  just been elected president of the United States by all accounts and from my
[54:08.760 --> 54:13.960]  watching him during the campaign could be volatile and I'm about to talk to him
[54:13.960 --> 54:19.360]  about allegations that he was involved with prostitutes in Moscow and that the
[54:19.360 --> 54:26.320]  Russians taped it and have leverage over him was there any choice there why if
[54:26.320 --> 54:30.480]  this was salacious let's it pause you've got Stephanophilus the former chief of
[54:30.480 --> 54:34.420]  staff for the Clintons just like when you see Brennan or you see these people
[54:34.420 --> 54:38.960]  used to have new if Fox was covering news core news they'd say that's our parent
[54:38.960 --> 54:42.200]  company or used to people would point out by the way I should say this I'm a
[54:42.200 --> 54:46.680]  Clinton operative Stephanophilus but they don't it's the former chief of
[54:46.680 --> 54:50.240]  staff for the Clintons Comey goes way back at the FBI with Mueller covering up
[54:50.240 --> 54:54.480]  for them it's all one little ringleader group here and they're just talking about
[54:54.480 --> 54:57.720]  prostitutes pinging on people when the whole thing's admitted to be fake and
[54:57.720 --> 55:03.360]  you look at Comey's body language this is a studied con man trying to not give
[55:03.360 --> 55:10.680]  off any facial expressions when he is lying his butt off let's continue if this
[55:10.680 --> 55:15.440]  was salacious and this particular part of the dossier unverified still
[55:15.440 --> 55:20.080]  unverified by the way yes so far is it when I got fired it was unverified did
[55:20.080 --> 55:23.440]  you tell him that the steel stop right there they think the audience is dumb
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.200]  it's been admitted to be totally fake but they know you don't have a long
[55:27.200 --> 55:29.920]  memory they hope you don't like Gruber said we're here about getting our
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.000]  memories up the snuff you can you can develop your memory as everybody knows
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.240]  unless you forgot that they're all betting you don't remember so they play
[55:37.240 --> 55:40.520]  this game they got to add that as a proviso but do it real slick like well
[55:40.520 --> 55:43.960]  still I don't remember since I got off well we don't know then oh god maybe
[55:43.960 --> 55:49.320]  it's true maybe the prostitutes you know projectile diarrhea all over it too
[55:49.320 --> 55:53.720]  maybe Trump drank gallons of diarrhea maybe you know maybe he jumped out of a
[55:53.720 --> 55:57.200]  window and turned into a bat and flew to Pluto let's continue with the former
[55:57.200 --> 56:01.360]  head of the Clinton operation Stephanophilus posing as an ABC news person
[56:01.360 --> 56:05.320]  let's hear from the political hack let's hear it as political opponents no I
[56:05.320 --> 56:08.680]  didn't I didn't think I used the term steel dossier I just talked about
[56:08.680 --> 56:12.400]  additional material but did he have a right to know that they have been
[56:12.400 --> 56:17.120]  financed by his political opponents that I don't know the answer to that it
[56:17.120 --> 56:22.800]  wasn't necessary for my goal which was to alert him that we have this information
[56:22.800 --> 56:27.160]  what a good friend we're alerting you he's the admitted guy that lied to
[56:27.160 --> 56:30.400]  Congress about leaking and then said well I didn't leak I gave it to a
[56:30.400 --> 56:37.360]  professor at a university to leak it that's like a mafia don I didn't kill
[56:37.360 --> 56:44.960]  Bobby the Bull I had Rocco one of my captains tell some of the soldiers that
[56:44.960 --> 56:50.200]  I had a problem then they didn't take care of the problem they were gonna be
[56:50.200 --> 56:56.440]  sleeping in the canal but I didn't hurt nobody let's go back to coma here he is
[56:56.440 --> 57:00.840]  how graphic did you get I think as graphic as I needed to be I started
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.680]  telling him about the allegation was that he had been involved with prostitutes
[57:04.680 --> 57:09.680]  in a hotel in Moscow in 2013 during a visit for the Miss Universe pageant and
[57:09.680 --> 57:17.480]  that the Russians had filmed the episode and he interrupted very defensively and
[57:17.480 --> 57:21.440]  started talking about it you know do I look like a guy who needs it pause
[57:21.440 --> 57:25.960]  defensively you got the FBI director telling you there's footage of you with
[57:25.960 --> 57:30.960]  hookers it's total bull from some neat freak it's well known just a load of

[1:00:43.960 --> 1:00:47.080]  what this is all about he was leaking the whole time he got caught lying to
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:50.920]  congress what a criminal he helped cover up with the clinton's and their crime
[1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:56.600]  rings so the hive got it half right with their headline trump thinks comey
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:01:01.920]  was trying to blackmail him oh no nobody tries to blackmail the president when
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:06.760]  you're the deep state no and shucky schumer never said that deep state has
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:11.800]  seven ways from sunday to get back at a president oh no there's no deep state at
[1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:16.040]  all no no no there's no permanent bureaucracy that's completely arrogant
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:20.560]  and sycophantic trying to start world war three with Russia and pushing trump
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:25.840]  into it while they got all this money from Russia and got our uranium while
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:29.880]  they're opening on the payroll the communist Chinese it's incredible but
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:35.600]  here's Stephanophilus in the interview with comey for his upcoming fiction
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:40.120]  novel wolf now admits his books basically fiction but that's later for
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:42.760]  lawsuits they add that oh by the way since the sales aren't good anymore
[1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:49.080]  it's fake the known charlton of new york even by the liberals wolf but don't
[1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:54.840]  make fun of him he's jewish the young turks will call you anti-semitic what
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:02:02.480]  does that even mean again that that's the crazies well I guess comey's comey's
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:05.760]  just a white guy any of my bash and white guys now I don't even know what
[1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:09.480]  comey's background is like you called brian stelter jewish but he's not I
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:13.600]  didn't say brian stelter was jewish I never even thought that but again that's
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:18.080]  their whole deception on their viewers to change the subject from comey is putting
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:22.200]  out a fake dossier got caught doing it it's criminal what they did and they're
[1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:29.040]  back recycling it again on ABC news with the former head of the Clinton
[1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:32.960]  White House Stephanophilus there should be an advisory on him you know how they
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:38.800]  want an advisory of something state-funded like NPR or PBS I kind of
[1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:44.040]  liked that but I want the government that business doing that they're doing
[1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:47.080]  with the Russians well how about this person's a former political operative
[1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:49.960]  this person works for the Clintons this person was involved reportedly in the
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:55.600]  crimes and the covering up with comey and Mueller you got two old pals two
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:59.360]  old gangsters hanging out making something about the Prez because he
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:04.800]  thinks he's the Prez and not them here it is the allegation was that he had been
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:09.840]  involved with prostitutes in a hotel in Moscow in 2013 during a visit for the
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:15.800]  Miss Universe pageant and that the Russians had filmed the episode and he
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:20.920]  interrupted very defensively and started talking about it you know do I look
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:26.360]  like a guy who needs hookers and I assumed he was asking that rhetorically I
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:31.120]  didn't answer that and I just moved on and explained so I'm not saying that we
[1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:34.760]  credit this not saying we believe it we just thought it very important you know
[1:03:34.760 --> 1:03:38.520]  did you tell him you thought it wasn't true or you didn't know if it was true
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:42.920]  or not I never said I don't believe it because like I couldn't say one way or
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:47.120]  another how weird was that briefing really weird all right let's stop right
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:51.400]  there oh it's really weird I'm a Clinton operative with a whole Clinton nest that
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:54.880]  made up the dossier and paid our wives and families for it and McCabe got a
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:58.600]  half million from Hillary and Stefan Offal escaped $75,000 the Clinton
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:02.520]  Foundation blah blah blah they don't tell you any of that they tell you that
[1:04:02.520 --> 1:04:07.480]  Trump is a cacostocracy that's what the CIA former director saying when he's up
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:10.880]  to his eyeballs the illegal spying on Trump it's a system of government which
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:15.800]  is run by the worst least qualified or most unscrupulous citizens they have
[1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:19.760]  just defined their whole criminal operation it's Trump that hadn't hired
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:23.440]  any lobbyists it's Trump that's got incredible standards it's Trump bringing
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:28.880]  the country back oh but Brennan says the country is in a total shambles and is in
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:33.040]  a disaster and a lamentable journey and the country's collapsing it's the

[1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:49.880]  perjury to Congress open and shut perjury the FBI open absconding with

[1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:42.560]  we're dealing with here and of course he sent me this footage you got from the
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:47.080]  Pentagon and I was since the similar stuff and I was like what in the world
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:52.920]  is this it's the behind-the-scenes stuff that was taken offline and scooped up
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:56.800]  scraped and I mean there's hours of it you know one day I sat up here and I've
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:03.640]  made myself watch it only once and I can't bring myself to play it one day we
[1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:07.240]  played them cutting the guy up on the table and making the Africans eat it and
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:10.600]  you can hear him calling him the C word I'm not gonna say because I'll edit it
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:15.760]  and say I said it on CNN but it's the it's the it's a word they use it sounds
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:20.200]  like calf if people go why does South Africans racist whites why would they
[1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:23.280]  call them the you know the C word you see that in lethal weapon about South
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:26.240]  Africa it's actually an accurate point where they were a diplomatic community
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:29.560]  and could do stuff and they would call people that name that's an Arabic term
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:34.000]  for black people and they're laughing at them while they cry and making them eat
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:44.880]  the flesh before they blow their heads off a satanic religion that believes it's
[1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:48.880]  fighting Satan how perfect let's go out to break with the best part of the worst
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:55.280]  part comey talking about Trump's morals here it is and then he says something
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:58.360]  that distracted me because he said you know if there's even a 1% chance my
[1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:04.480]  wife thinks that's true that's terrible and I and I remember thinking how could
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:08.120]  your wife think there's a 1% chance you were with prostitutes peeing on each
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:13.760]  other in Moscow I'm a flawed human being but there's literally zero chance that
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:17.720]  my wife would think that was true so what kind of marriage to what kind of man
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:22.640]  is your wife think there's only a 99% chance you didn't do that and I said to
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:27.120]  him sir when he started talking about it I may order you to investigate that I
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:31.920]  said sir that's up to you but you'd want to be careful about that because it
[1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:35.680]  might create a narrative that we're investigating you personally and second
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:39.680]  it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen did you believe this
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:43.000]  denial I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth but I
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.560]  don't know whether the this is a guy that covered up with the rest of the

[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:54.440]  people I ever talked to that were in the CIA even going back to when I was a
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:25:00.760]  kid talked about how bad the globalist were in the New World Order and how
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:04.440]  great the John Burt society was and how we were going to stop their world
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:08.040]  government and their casual society and that there'd be a pope coming up who'd
[1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:11.400]  called for world government and would basically deny Christ and all of it's
[1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:13.680]  happening
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:20.440]  but one thing the globalist do I've got an article here today about is the end of
[1:25:20.440 --> 1:25:25.560]  the world here Sunday Express and they can always find some church or somebody
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:28.800]  obsessed with numerology who's saying this is the date I can't tell you how
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:34.040]  many times that's happened in my life well the Bible says watch out that pull
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:37.720]  up the quotes that we can watch out for those that say they know the hour of the
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:41.640]  time for no man know at the time and those that tell you they know the time
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:47.080]  are false prophets because Christ will come like a thief in the night
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:55.080]  and we're all raptured by the gravity weapon being released the whole solar
[1:25:55.080 --> 1:26:03.920]  system evaporating instantly anyway continuing into the world 2018 will the
[1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:11.400]  rapture occur on April 23rd shock prediction says according to conspiracy
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:15.120]  theorists that means people that question it's a mainline orthodoxy then
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:19.520]  it's mm-hmm codes in the Bible suggest the end of the world is imminent with
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:25.320]  earth set to be destroyed April 23rd well I can't say the earth doesn't deserve
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:28.160]  it but there's so a lot of innocence on the planet so I don't think that's gonna
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:33.400]  happen but we could really have another Atlantean moment whether you believe in
[1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:38.000]  Atlantis or not where we destroy most life on earth you know Plato wrote a lot
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:41.320]  of stuff that was true it's also the father of eugenics the father of modern
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:45.800]  lead-ism and royalty and all nine yards chief of the architecture we now live
[1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:53.320]  under you call him the leader der führer probably the most important man
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:27:01.040]  that's ever lived other than Christ who was no man as we know but God avatar on
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:07.200]  the planet jacked in to walk amongst us now it all makes sense doesn't it and the
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:10.720]  globalist all know that and they put it out in their cosmologies now in movies
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:13.440]  everywhere they get it now they're like oh my god this is all real it's all
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:16.920]  coming true how do that now that they've all adopted the Bible but they think
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:22.200]  they're gonna use it as a cheat sheet to get out of it there's not a Hollywood
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:25.800]  or a top engineer or not a globalist it doesn't know what's going on folks they
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:33.360]  know they know but they've picked the wrong side the God of this world the
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:40.640]  ten horn psychic interdimensional dictator that they think is a God and
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:46.680]  they're gonna follow right into hell don't fear those that can kill the body
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:50.280]  fear those that can kill the soul and and as I said if you pull up we put the
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:55.560]  Bible verse I don't know the exact this no man know at the time but it's this
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:28:01.200]  constant thing and then I was picking up Italian food about five years ago when
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:03.840]  I was at other big church that said the other world was coming in the media made
[1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:07.520]  fun of the old guy and all that and I was in there getting food one out about
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:15.560]  630 taking it home my wife wanted Italian food and
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:20.200]  got behind the counter giving it to me it's out of glass while I was waiting
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:23.920]  for the food to come he goes Alan's I see your show and all this you don't
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:26.640]  really agree with these dumb Christians do you know because they just said the
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:28.920]  world was gonna end last week it didn't end do you believe that I said that's
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:32.480]  all pushed by the media just because some quack says something doesn't mean
[1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:36.000]  that's the case but if you don't think the stuff in revelations world
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:41.640]  government a mark to buy and sell giant mountains of fire that destroy whole
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:46.480]  armies of giant flying metal insects that fire flaming spears out helicopters
[1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:50.640]  you don't go look at Egyptian tombs with perfect Cobra attack helicopters
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:53.960]  carved on the wall and it's like something's going on something's going on
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:59.760]  I don't know what but it's big face it today's electric power grid is more
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.920]  vulnerable than ever from natural disasters to EMP attacks and hacking the
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:08.480]  grid could be crippled for days or even decades in the most dire scenarios visit

[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:17.120]  while millions suffer you'll have vital power for water pumps refrigeration and
[1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:22.120]  sanitation now that's peace of mind EMP protected solar power systems for every

[1:32:02.480 --> 1:32:07.120]  we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal
[1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:11.880]  distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye
[1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:18.360]  comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France notice that
[1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:22.280]  people who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and
[1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:26.360]  inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published
[1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:31.080]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:35.840]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:40.760]  is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[1:32:40.760 --> 1:32:44.800]  is found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which
[1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:49.800]  is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go

[1:33:44.840 --> 1:33:51.640]  calls I've already hit some of the news there's so much more here you know here's
[1:33:51.640 --> 1:34:02.800]  the deal I was brought up to be extremely tolerant of everybody and then I
[1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:07.880]  studied history and I saw how all these other groups are extremely
[1:34:07.880 --> 1:34:24.240]  militaristic tribalistic monotheistic barbaristic piratical fanatical
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:39.680]  delusional usurpers there are more than 50 Muslim countries there's Muslim
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:44.320]  countries and then no other religions basically allowed the few where it is
[1:34:44.320 --> 1:34:46.960]  our government's trying to overthrow it and turn it over the radical jihadis
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:51.600]  from Egypt to Syria there's two different types of countries there's
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:56.000]  Islamic countries and there's not Islamic countries and then I look at the
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  doubling of Christian persecution last decade and Obama Han showing that and
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:05.880]  the Pope coming out in bad mouthing and being a globalist and Apple and Google
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:09.840]  delisting Easter and other Christian holidays and just the animus and I'm
[1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:13.920]  sitting here going and then now the family's bad and mother and father and
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:17.440]  it's not just the universities it's everywhere and these people are on
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:20.560]  power trips and they're criminals and I'm not even talking about the Muslims
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:31.440]  there but the sick nihilistic freakazoid left I mean we've all gone to leftist
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:35.720]  rallies I mean they're ugly they're stupid they can't talk no one will talk
[1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:42.240]  to you they only have talking points they they act mentally ill the higher
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:48.840]  caste is is is vicious the kind of professor management class and you're
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:52.880]  like my god these are people that bought into the New World Order bought into
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:59.200]  globalism bought into their post-modernism and they I just keep
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:03.240]  going back to this they hate you okay I just want to keep like an emergency
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:06.400]  beacon they hate you they hate you they hate you they want to take what you've
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:11.240]  got they want to kill you they want to destroy you they are just and it's the
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:17.480]  realization that there aren't any liberals anymore liberals used to have a
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:21.560]  lot of good points about free speech and anti-war and good things those were
[1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:27.560]  classical liberals they're gone because through versus signalings of political
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:33.600]  correctness they by successive approximation by increment have gotten
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:38.480]  the average Democrat to accept anything and now you open up mainline
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:43.200]  newspapers whites are inherently bad Christians are bad the family is bad and
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:53.320]  you're like where do they go next arresting people force reeducation I've
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:57.800]  had these lepis on the air I've been out to dinner with them years ago and they'll
[1:36:57.800 --> 1:37:01.080]  always invariably say Alex if you don't go what we want we're gonna put you in
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:08.120]  a reeducation camp and they invariably sit there and go Alex we're not really
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:11.160]  liberal civil rights activists were communists in we're gonna kill a bunch
[1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:17.120]  of people we take over and me and Rob doers dinner once with a prominent
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:22.680]  civil rights activist and well they had a three or four tequila's and they're
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:26.600]  talking about how much they want to murder everybody and you know the first
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:31.160]  couple times that happens they go we got a bad apple no those of us that aren't
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:38.120]  ravenous demons are blind we do not understand what we're up against why
[1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:42.200]  would the neocons and the Democrats want to blow up the Russians when they're
[1:37:42.200 --> 1:37:45.560]  trying to exit Syria when we know the rebels have staged it at least three
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:51.040]  times why would we do that why would they rush to do it why when they know
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:58.920]  the Russians will retaliate because it's thrilling to psychopaths to push Russia
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:02.520]  like they pushed him out of Iraq and they pushed him out of Libya and they
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:05.880]  pushed him out of Serbia and they let the Muslims the radical Muslims take
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:08.360]  over everywhere you see where the globalist are allied for a long time
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:11.440]  now demographically they decided to go with them there'll be three billion
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:18.520]  Muslims by 2025 according to the UN and every Muslim that lets Christians and
[1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:22.800]  Jews and others live in peace that tries to put in hotels and swimming pools
[1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:27.560]  and lets people have rock and roll music every one of them gets killed or
[1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:34.440]  overthrown except for Assad whose father did some bad stuff and I didn't agree
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:37.560]  with him and Assad's been a dictator he's trying to phase out he thought the
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:43.640]  West the same time Gaddafi 10 years ago 11 years ago thought oh you want to work
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:47.080]  with us sure we'll modernize we'll let you in it was all a double cross to let
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:55.760]  the operatives in to set them up so we're gonna go to break when we come up
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:39:01.360]  with your calls we're gonna go to Jason and Mark and Catherine and Jason and

[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:31.240]  horrible person if they got 900 billion on us you don't put 50 billion on them
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:34.760]  that's not fair racist
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:42.640]  I mean that's all Trump really is like a tourniquet on our leg chopped off and
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:47.320]  the media and everybody else is like no no no take the tourniquet off because
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:50.280]  we're gonna bankrupt America and we're gonna teach the bitter-claimers

[1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:26.360]  Reuters and Bloomberg turned out to be inaccurate and the outlets issued a

[1:49:55.680 --> 1:50:01.880]  jason yes sir what up alex i have two two points my last point we'll put a
[1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:07.160]  cherry on top a bow tie on my first point my first point is this alex
[1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:14.960]  we are not in a war with the global because a war implies that both sides
[1:50:14.960 --> 1:50:20.760]  are engaged at least both sides we are not engaging the globalists we're not
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:28.200]  engaged we are not engaging we are basically clueless and they are we're
[1:50:28.200 --> 1:50:36.280]  under siege and if the people of this country especially the military ever
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:41.200]  stood up to the globalist it would be over very quickly and that's where i
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:48.760]  feel like and i'm gonna say i'm i'm gonna preface this big fan ears but i do
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:54.160]  believe that you are deliberately misleading people in saying that we
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:59.680]  can't fight the globalist physically and then i think you probably reasons for
[1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:07.080]  that maybe legal reasons but we have to because historically and you know this
[1:51:07.080 --> 1:51:11.280]  this is why i believe it's deliberate you know historically there's never been
[1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:18.040]  a war that's been one not physically all right let me talk let me let me hold
[1:51:18.040 --> 1:51:22.120]  on put him on hold no no you just had a minute i'm gonna talk now i understand
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:27.960]  it makes everybody big man to call in and then tell people i'm a bad person
[1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:34.840]  without evidence of it i morally do what i think's best here on air and if you
[1:51:34.840 --> 1:51:36.840]  know about the committee's the correspondence i'll go back to you in a
[1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:42.240]  minute jason for a decade before the revolutionary war in 1775 officially
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:47.960]  1776 people had a redress of grievances they educated people they exposed what
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:57.240]  was going on they tried to fix it peacefully that's a be everybody that
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:00.400]  always calls in or comments on the website wanting violence saying i'm a
[1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:04.880]  wimp because i'm not calling you know for war and saying saddle up let's put
[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:09.120]  our helmets on and get our guns what what are they doing they're always
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:12.440]  waiting on somebody else to lead it and i'm not calling for you to be violent
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:17.520]  and and call my bluffs it's not a bluff sir the globalist stage false flags
[1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:21.320]  against themselves like Oklahoma City and others and provocateur others and
[1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:28.280]  let other events happen like what you saw in Florida they didn't stage it but
[1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:34.640]  they knew it was coming they stood down yet again in a blue city so this idea
[1:52:34.640 --> 1:52:38.320]  that i'm not doing enough up here on air i'm there one of their main enemies
[1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:42.440]  trump has got in he's restoring a lot of sovereignty pulled us out of the TPP
[1:52:42.440 --> 1:52:47.280]  did a lot of other stuff they just hated because he's actually being a

[1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:01.520]  we're here exposing that globalism is unelected it's offshore it's tax exempt
[1:54:01.520 --> 1:54:06.000]  it plays groups off against each other it's it's amoral and people are
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:10.080]  listing we had Nigel Farage on yesterday nationalist parties are taking
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:15.160]  control of the EU parliament it's elected the bureaucracy is not so they've got
[1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:18.920]  them taking it over to expose it to dismantle it we're on the march the
[1:54:18.920 --> 1:54:25.320]  empire is on the run and there's this instant gratification thing I mean if
[1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:32.400]  you knew and I'm not whining but if you knew the stuff they've done to me
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:37.960]  behind the scenes if you had any idea the the it's made me stronger quite
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:41.160]  frankly it's one thing to say you're fearless it's another thing to actually
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:45.040]  go through it all and just be a completely stronger personally on the
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:51.160]  side committed my will and spirit have never been stronger and so when I get
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:58.600]  mad at you it's because you call in and just authoritatively say that I am
[1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:05.600]  holding back calling for violence when I've already had them try to take my
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:11.760]  children lie about me 17 lawsuits death threat stuff you couldn't imagine paying
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:16.200]  off people I knew for 14 years tell lies about me and I know that they've let me
[1:55:16.200 --> 1:55:20.560]  know the the increases the threat just goes up from there that's just the
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:27.880]  warning so I've got a full globalist demonization campaign at the level they
[1:55:27.880 --> 1:55:31.200]  have when they launch a war against another country they're launching
[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:38.640]  propaganda against me the European and US press like I'm a foreign government I'm
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:42.440]  under the level of attack that governments before wars are under now
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:46.680]  does anybody kind of think maybe we're covering something that's important maybe
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:51.240]  the system scared of something they're scared because the military and
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:54.360]  intelligence agencies listen because they know I'm on target know what I'm
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:57.680]  talking about and we've already taken back much of the bureaucracy at the
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:56:01.960]  level where the rubber meets the road you got a minute to finish up go ahead
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:06.840]  tell me how I can be a better person Jason Alex I'm not saying you're bad I
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:11.760]  have a deep respect for you I know you're a good person and it just boy by
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:16.640]  what you always say but it's the fruit of the tree that you can tell it on but I
[1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:19.960]  want to make my final point is this so there's no good food for nimble wars
[1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:24.320]  there's no good food no no not at all I'm saying the exact opposite but here's
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:30.280]  my final point I want to call right now on the United States military and the
[1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:36.520]  intelligence agencies to stand up go rogue take out the globalist engage right
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:40.200]  now and we'll end this and we'll have freedom and liberty 1736 worldwide
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:48.480]  that's it done well I've said this deep state operators funded by communist
[1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:53.540]  China the Saudi Arabian money's been cut off they're involved in covert
[1:56:53.540 --> 1:56:57.680]  operations killing people shooting people in the back Seth rich investigators
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:02.880]  not just Seth rich so they are getting ready to go violent to try to push this
[1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:06.240]  into it and you know thugs always think they're gonna win until their heads
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:10.560]  bounce up and down off the ground so I'm not actually here's the deal I don't
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:18.440]  want to make that called because I'm not sure about it but they are pushing us
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:22.720]  into a position but don't worry long before they've got their actuaries long
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:25.800]  before they know our tops gonna blow they're gonna blow up some federal
[1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:29.400]  buildings with daycare centers and blame it on us so you're gonna probably get
[1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:33.760]  the war you want sign so I hope you got your powder dry and you're all
[1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:38.480]  rigged up it's me shooting war that's like means nothing to me that's like

[2:05:03.660 --> 2:05:08.540]  healthy for energy stamina mental clarity you name it and we created a
[2:05:08.540 --> 2:05:11.860]  stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there it's
[2:05:11.860 --> 2:05:15.140]  very simple we went out and like look what is the top what is the best we'll
[2:05:15.140 --> 2:05:18.300]  just put even more product in we'll make it better leading competitors but two
[2:05:18.300 --> 2:05:22.740]  dollars a product in it sell it for 60 bucks we put $10 in it and sell it for
[2:05:22.740 --> 2:05:27.700]  30 bucks it's $19.95 right now so you get an incredible top-of-the-line
[2:05:27.700 --> 2:05:33.380]  new tropic for $19.95 believe me we're selling it for $35 on average we need
[2:05:33.380 --> 2:05:36.740]  that 15-20 bucks we make to fund this operation in the face the global threat
[2:05:36.740 --> 2:05:41.100]  of it but I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks I want
[2:05:41.100 --> 2:05:44.700]  to shell it all out before the big supply comes in and I want people that

[2:07:19.460 --> 2:07:23.900]  cyber nuke against World War three whatever that means. Catherine why didn't
[2:07:23.900 --> 2:07:27.860]  the FBI try to protect Trump from Russia blackmail because it's all made up.

[2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:51.500]  happen so much going on but whenever I saw Trump on Wednesday with the tweet

[2:08:09.700 --> 2:08:13.700]  what the deep state wants within six days this happens and we're supposed to
[2:08:13.700 --> 2:08:19.020]  rush to it but then Mattis yesterday came out and said no we don't have any
[2:08:19.020 --> 2:08:25.220]  evidence it was a side so this shows the battle going on with the deep state
[2:08:25.220 --> 2:08:29.220]  president John McCain but because of his brain tumor more and more the deep state
[2:08:29.220 --> 2:08:34.340]  president is Mueller he is their God and then you've got the vice deep state

[2:09:04.700 --> 2:09:09.740]  go ahead doc you're on the air now overall the deep state at the the
[2:09:09.740 --> 2:09:13.980]  republic is fine because the republic people are working the unemployment is
[2:09:13.980 --> 2:09:18.900]  low the economy is going up unfortunately the stock market is what we
[2:09:18.900 --> 2:09:23.900]  call a lead in the newspaper market in other words it's reacting every time to
[2:09:23.900 --> 2:09:29.380]  the false news that's coming out in terms of Comey in terms of Mueller those
[2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:34.700]  people will either be fired or they eventually become irrelevant what is
[2:09:34.700 --> 2:09:38.580]  wonderful about what happened including all of the people on your show and
[2:09:38.580 --> 2:09:44.620]  otherwise is that Mattis and others came forth and said look this is a false flag
[2:09:44.620 --> 2:09:51.260]  we've had British American and French troops in Syria for quite a while we
[2:09:51.260 --> 2:09:55.540]  did have it in exchange between the Russians and the Americans some were
[2:09:55.540 --> 2:10:01.340]  heard the issue about Djibouti where the planes were were crashing was really a
[2:10:01.340 --> 2:10:07.060]  cover-up for unfortunately brave warriors who died in Syria we're not
[2:10:07.060 --> 2:10:12.220]  interested in going into war thanks to Mattis who understands very well that
[2:10:12.220 --> 2:10:17.980]  war is not the solution for this as does Trump Trump is really just twittering
[2:10:17.980 --> 2:10:22.980]  all of the aspects in terms of the fact that he's threatening and putting a
[2:10:22.980 --> 2:10:29.100]  position in where he's putting Putin and he's putting the will as a notice but
[2:10:29.100 --> 2:10:34.260]  is he in fact going to go into war I think not ironically with John Bolton
[2:10:34.260 --> 2:10:40.900]  there who you would think would promote war I think he has become somewhat more
[2:10:40.900 --> 2:10:45.980]  acquiescent to the demands of a greater general like Mattis Mattis knows
[2:10:45.980 --> 2:10:50.500]  exactly what generals have to do in order to go to war they know very well
[2:10:50.500 --> 2:10:55.860]  that war is not the solution and when you have a false flag it was initiated
[2:10:55.860 --> 2:11:00.980]  by the Israelis once again this is the way a dependent country which acts like
[2:11:00.980 --> 2:11:05.620]  a teenager for the most part wants to bring the United States back into the
[2:11:05.620 --> 2:11:10.340]  Middle East when in fact the United States has no national security interests
[2:11:10.340 --> 2:11:15.980]  whatsoever in the Middle East thanks to Trump we are now an exporter of oil
[2:11:15.980 --> 2:11:21.580]  anytime we have a strategic reserve depletion we can fill it up in 340
[2:11:21.580 --> 2:11:26.180]  I want to go back to that but since you mentioned it Brennan has called Trump a
[2:11:26.180 --> 2:11:31.060]  catristic which means a corrupt inept government but actually look at all the
[2:11:31.060 --> 2:11:35.500]  real indicators the country everything's turning around I agree Trump just like on
[2:11:35.500 --> 2:11:40.460]  DACA or just like on the guns he says one thing to get the Hawks off his back I
[2:11:40.460 --> 2:11:44.300]  think Putin knew that was you know cartoonish on purpose but then had no
[2:11:44.300 --> 2:11:47.540]  intention of actually striking Russian forces again that could lead us to
[2:11:47.540 --> 2:11:54.260]  World War three but again the boldness of the deep state stay behind you know
[2:11:54.260 --> 2:11:58.140]  telling Trump shut his mouth like Brennan did the first week when Trump was in
[2:11:58.140 --> 2:12:01.740]  the White House couldn't believe Trump fired him I mean what is going on with
[2:12:01.740 --> 2:12:06.300]  Brennan and clapper they seem completely delusional well they're not delusional
[2:12:06.300 --> 2:12:11.180]  it's exactly what you and I talked about 13 14 years ago I have no respect for
[2:12:11.180 --> 2:12:16.900]  Brennan Brennan is one of the most pathetic incompetent corrupt DCI's he
[2:12:16.900 --> 2:12:21.860]  did not start as a DDO at Colbert operative instead he sucked his way up
[2:12:21.860 --> 2:12:26.580]  to the political system he may have converted to Islam and was a disaster
[2:12:26.580 --> 2:12:31.460]  the reason he could come up with the system of the CIA is that nobody stopped
[2:12:31.460 --> 2:12:37.100]  them he was an absolute disaster in Saudi Arabia he was a disaster under the
[2:12:37.100 --> 2:12:42.260]  Bush and Clinton administration he should be put in prison I've said it for a
[2:12:42.260 --> 2:12:47.420]  long time Hayden is the same way and so is the other one let's explain it there
[2:12:47.420 --> 2:12:51.620]  are a bunch of lip-wristed fraud sycophants that can't even tie their
[2:12:51.620 --> 2:12:54.980]  shoelaces that have never done anything for the country but have been put in
[2:12:54.980 --> 2:12:58.540]  there because they're political traitors correct but they're not lip limp
[2:12:58.540 --> 2:13:04.140]  risted these are real criminals this is where you need to have an FBI director
[2:13:04.140 --> 2:13:08.620]  and an attorney general that is not Mueller that is not Tony you're saying
[2:13:08.620 --> 2:13:13.900]  they have real criminal energy this is criminal there's no question that Brennan
[2:13:13.900 --> 2:13:20.740]  is a crime criminal he initiated 9 11 he worked with Bush on 9 11 he worked with
[2:13:20.740 --> 2:13:25.980]  Cheney on 9 11 he worked with worms on 9 11 there's no question this man's an
[2:13:25.980 --> 2:13:31.700]  idiot I've known him I've known all about him for years to come and the CIA
[2:13:31.700 --> 2:13:35.380]  should have thrown him out a long time ago and when you talk to those generals
[2:13:35.380 --> 2:13:38.460]  when we had you on you know right up to 9 11 about when you were in the council
[2:13:38.460 --> 2:13:41.340]  and farm relations of course you were co-wrote Clancy's books from some of you
[2:13:41.340 --> 2:13:45.340]  are I mean the generals are all very open about the stand down all of the 28
[2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:50.340]  pages we knew about that 16 17 years ago we've been vindicated and so I guess
[2:13:50.340 --> 2:13:53.980]  our military's been simmering under the surface really upset about this for a
[2:13:53.980 --> 2:13:58.460]  while well I know you don't like to hear what I'm about to say thanks to you and
[2:13:58.460 --> 2:14:03.340]  your audience our military has been simmering since about 2002 and 2003 they
[2:14:03.340 --> 2:14:08.300]  have been incredible generals including general Boykin Keith Alexander and a whole
[2:14:08.300 --> 2:14:13.300]  group of them who began to understand that they were being coerced or usurped
[2:14:13.300 --> 2:14:17.740]  by these neocon cowards who are basically gonna double cross this with
[2:14:17.740 --> 2:14:21.940]  radical Islam in the final game and college incredible it's exactly what
[2:14:21.940 --> 2:14:27.420]  happened Saudi Arabia Israel now are involved in the same false flag that
[2:14:27.420 --> 2:14:32.620]  they were involved in 9 11 instead of punishing Israel getting rid of the being
[2:14:32.620 --> 2:14:37.460]  bringing in a moderate the Israeli people have done absolutely nothing but
[2:14:37.460 --> 2:14:41.940]  allowed their boys to die for nothing well I want to be clear and I know
[2:14:41.940 --> 2:14:45.260]  you're a part Jewish and your family died in the Holocaust and all of it so you
[2:14:45.260 --> 2:14:48.900]  can specifically speak this I know you thought your history the whole thing is
[2:14:48.900 --> 2:14:53.340]  clear though even the Russian ambassador to the EU Russian ambassador to the UN
[2:14:53.340 --> 2:14:57.740]  both said this is a false flag coalition forces in their training but the ala
[2:14:57.740 --> 2:15:01.940]  Akbar crowd that Saudi Arabia the first time gave the chemical mortars to they
[2:15:01.940 --> 2:15:04.700]  want to be rock stars at the millions of dollars for launching attack they
[2:15:04.700 --> 2:15:08.380]  videotaped and ala Akbar did so the reason we know they stage it is that
[2:15:08.380 --> 2:15:12.340]  is there so out of control because long as this don't even cover up they're
[2:15:12.340 --> 2:15:16.420]  doing it so I'm not defending Israel but I haven't been sure who was behind it we
[2:15:16.420 --> 2:15:19.860]  just know it's a false flag because a motive in history and past action I
[2:15:19.860 --> 2:15:22.540]  know you have great connections but we're gonna go to break when come back
[2:15:22.540 --> 2:15:26.660]  tell us who's telling you dr. Steve Puchenik that it was Israel did this I
[2:15:26.660 --> 2:15:30.580]  know Israel's been meeting with the new prince in his whole PR campaign they've
[2:15:30.580 --> 2:15:33.460]  been very close with these secret meetings and I know Saudi Arabia doesn't
[2:15:33.460 --> 2:15:40.420]  want Israel that told me Israel's behavior so consistent you can't avoid it it
[2:15:40.420 --> 2:15:45.460]  was predictable print me that zero-head six reasons Trump they think may hit
[2:15:45.460 --> 2:15:49.620]  Syria because I mean it's true Israel has an old beef with Syria and so yeah
[2:15:49.620 --> 2:15:52.260]  this is just something to look at we'll be right back with your phone calls as

[2:20:25.180 --> 2:20:28.580]  your phone calls are coming up they're all on topics Steve Pachennick's
[2:20:28.580 --> 2:20:34.620]  driving shotgun with us Steve Pachennick yeah it was a former head of psychological operations
[2:20:34.620 --> 2:20:38.420]  at the State Department and other positions really smart guy he's been
[2:20:38.420 --> 2:20:43.260]  dead on I've been interviewing him for gosh it's gonna be 17 years 16 17 years
[2:20:43.260 --> 2:20:46.500]  I read like a council on farm relations transcripts so he was telling them they
[2:20:46.500 --> 2:20:51.180]  were all idiots and then the line levels of pretext to start all these wars it
[2:20:51.180 --> 2:20:55.860]  was gonna blow up in their face but now we sit here and we see radical Islam
[2:20:55.860 --> 2:20:58.980]  openly allied with the left of the globalist to flood Europe I want to ask
[2:20:58.980 --> 2:21:02.220]  you what the plan is with that but we got caught off by the break when he was
[2:21:02.220 --> 2:21:07.900]  getting to a very very important point let's let's go back to that Alex
[2:21:07.900 --> 2:21:13.340]  basically what happens is very simple I spent three weeks in in Syria before the
[2:21:13.340 --> 2:21:17.860]  war broke out I got to meet all the military people the intelligence as
[2:21:17.860 --> 2:21:22.300]  well then I'm interested in a war with Israel that's not their interest and
[2:21:22.300 --> 2:21:26.220]  you've been there before you you were actually locked up by Assad's dad that's
[2:21:26.220 --> 2:21:31.660]  correct I had no protection they took me around for 17 18 days went to Latakia
[2:21:31.660 --> 2:21:36.060]  Palmyra homes commas but I could see in the homes in the Hamas that they were
[2:21:36.060 --> 2:21:41.780]  Sunni Muslim you have a country that's ruled by Elohim Elohim minority Muslims
[2:21:41.780 --> 2:21:46.540]  they're almost what we call like Muslims and Bashar Assad his father and his
[2:21:46.540 --> 2:21:49.820]  brothers aren't they really just sheep-dipped Christians like they had to
[2:21:49.820 --> 2:21:54.260]  convert Islam but they're really not well you know I don't want to get into it
[2:21:54.260 --> 2:21:59.660]  it's a form of Shiite Islam but a very light form and the French brought them
[2:21:59.660 --> 2:22:03.420]  in in the 1920s they were located in the mountains so they brought them to a
[2:22:03.420 --> 2:22:08.460]  beautiful area on the Mediterranean Latakia so Macron knows the history of
[2:22:08.460 --> 2:22:12.980]  this country very well the French know it they know that Assad does not want to
[2:22:12.980 --> 2:22:17.700]  go to war the problem is they basically like mystics I mean that particular
[2:22:17.700 --> 2:22:21.660]  group like mystics no that's that would be a little bit more like the Sufi
[2:22:21.660 --> 2:22:26.660]  Muslims Sufi yeah those are the ones who are like they will swirl around and
[2:22:26.660 --> 2:22:31.460]  they will kind of get lightheaded and they're not ardent Muslims as much as
[2:22:31.460 --> 2:22:37.100]  they are metaphysicists and our whites are really very compassionate they hit
[2:22:37.100 --> 2:22:42.780]  Bashar takes care of the Jews the Druze the Christians everyone else I I mean
[2:22:42.780 --> 2:22:46.900]  it's amazing nobody understands that he is an ophthalmologist he really isn't
[2:22:46.900 --> 2:22:50.980]  looking for trouble when he wanted to stay in power and I warned the council
[2:22:50.980 --> 2:22:57.540]  on foreign relations particularly he's immature ignorant CIA operatives do not
[2:22:57.540 --> 2:23:04.140]  go into the into Syria and of course it was Hillary Clinton it was the entire
[2:23:04.140 --> 2:23:08.380]  Obama administration went in without knowing exactly their attempt to have an
[2:23:08.380 --> 2:23:11.380]  Arab Spring bring it down and give it to the jihadis blow up in their face now
[2:23:11.380 --> 2:23:15.500]  the Russians are pulling out why in Hades would the Russians are Assad when
[2:23:15.500 --> 2:23:19.140]  they're winning stage a chemical attack on civilians that's the dumbest thing
[2:23:19.140 --> 2:23:23.900]  ever no and that's the point you and also I spent time in the Soviet Union I
[2:23:23.900 --> 2:23:28.900]  did a regime change but I also knew when Putin came in Leon KGB didn't know who
[2:23:28.900 --> 2:23:32.540]  Putin was I explained it to them he was an East German intelligence officer
[2:23:32.540 --> 2:23:38.140]  he's very smart he knows exactly how the agency works he knows exactly the
[2:23:38.140 --> 2:23:42.420]  tactical and strategic elements a covert operation he doesn't need this they
[2:23:42.420 --> 2:23:47.580]  already had basically taken out an exchange of what some of our special
[2:23:47.580 --> 2:23:52.180]  forces one forcefully were killed and that was covered by the issue of Djibouti
[2:23:52.180 --> 2:23:57.860]  airline our airplanes were shot down in Djibouti that's not correct the soldiers
[2:23:57.860 --> 2:24:02.900]  who were killed were brave warriors in the units in Syria and then the person I
[2:24:02.900 --> 2:24:06.980]  think who was involved in the exchange would be senator Duckworth who was a
[2:24:06.980 --> 2:24:13.460]  brave heroine still is who lost her legs in the Iraq war and I think she
[2:24:13.460 --> 2:24:18.460]  negotiated the release of our American special forces in turn the British were
[2:24:18.460 --> 2:24:23.620]  taken out the Israeli pulled back and the French has just stayed there usually
[2:24:23.620 --> 2:24:26.260]  you're given a whole history but beginning past that we need to get the
[2:24:26.260 --> 2:24:30.660]  calls and a bunch of the big issues right the deep state is full-on rating
[2:24:30.660 --> 2:24:35.100]  Trump Tower over a woman 11 years ago a complete mission creep totally illegal
[2:24:35.100 --> 2:24:38.820]  all the lawyers all the experts agree they're cornered rats they're totally
[2:24:38.820 --> 2:24:43.460]  rogue this is dangerous and I don't know how under the Constitution you name it
[2:24:43.460 --> 2:24:46.500]  when the Communist Chinese and others are openly the only group funding the
[2:24:46.500 --> 2:24:50.620]  Democrats right now for my information Trump's cut off the Saudi funding got
[2:24:50.620 --> 2:24:54.620]  them to you know at least partially reform what is going on with Trump right
[2:24:54.620 --> 2:24:59.740]  now I mean how much of this can be put up with well that's a good question for
[2:24:59.740 --> 2:25:06.460]  my perspective I think Trump is having a massive amount of input that he has to
[2:25:06.460 --> 2:25:10.900]  filter out very quickly but there's one element about Trump that most people
[2:25:10.900 --> 2:25:15.820]  don't understand the one thing Trump loves more than anything else is action
[2:25:15.820 --> 2:25:24.020]  and high intensity decisions the worst thing for Trump is really bored nothing
[2:25:24.020 --> 2:25:28.020]  to do so in a situation by the way what you say from people I know about Trump
[2:25:28.020 --> 2:25:32.940]  that's exactly it he is super bored with just regular things he likes super
[2:25:32.940 --> 2:25:37.380]  high-tension deals he's a bit he's a businessman and what he's doing now he
[2:25:37.380 --> 2:25:41.860]  loves the input that's coming in from China Russia from Syria from his
[2:25:41.860 --> 2:25:46.380]  military officers and what he's going to do is the same thing he did in the
[2:25:46.380 --> 2:25:50.100]  business world he's going to give to those people whom he trusts and
[2:25:50.100 --> 2:25:53.940]  particularly Mattis you make the decision what we're going to do in the
[2:25:53.940 --> 2:25:57.940]  meantime I will Twitter whatever it is I will Twitter and then the New York
[2:25:57.940 --> 2:26:02.980]  Times will call him imbecile lazy and stupid it's the reverse the man has
[2:26:02.980 --> 2:26:08.700]  basically said in the art of the deal create uncertainty create friction create
[2:26:08.700 --> 2:26:14.220]  excitement use the newspapers anytime you want because the left and the
[2:26:14.220 --> 2:26:18.500]  newspapers are lazy they didn't even read the other one dimension even read
[2:26:18.500 --> 2:26:23.940]  their their their enemies own treat us you know his whole world view because
[2:26:23.940 --> 2:26:27.660]  they're only one dimensional about right now trying to score a point they don't
[2:26:27.660 --> 2:26:32.940]  get how they're playing into it why is the modern left so stupid because they're
[2:26:32.940 --> 2:26:37.340]  arrogant arrogance leads to ignorance and self-destruction I've seen this
[2:26:37.340 --> 2:26:42.340]  repeatedly one after another they don't learn the history the one thing we
[2:26:42.340 --> 2:26:46.340]  Republicans have always done we've concentrated on foreign policy what our
[2:26:46.340 --> 2:26:51.700]  history is what it wasn't even the the people at University Chicago who are
[2:26:51.700 --> 2:26:56.460]  conservatives knew that December 7th was a false flag even though they let it
[2:26:56.460 --> 2:26:58.900]  happen yeah but let me ask this we got to go to break other calls I promise I'm
[2:26:58.900 --> 2:27:02.700]  gonna go right to Catherine and Caroline we come back I promise briefly I'm not
[2:27:02.700 --> 2:27:06.300]  whining but you talked your sources when they had us kicked off YouTube you said
[2:27:06.300 --> 2:27:09.180]  it's a coup d'etat inside there it's a mutiny it's gonna be cleaned up in a few
[2:27:09.180 --> 2:27:13.860]  days geospatial center runs it in I say which everybody knows I told reporters
[2:27:13.860 --> 2:27:17.740]  that they think I'm crazy that's just a fact it's in mainstream news and sure
[2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:21.300]  enough it's taking them a month they've turned everybody's channel back on they
[2:27:21.300 --> 2:27:25.180]  had to go through it all it's happened so what's happening now with like this
[2:27:25.180 --> 2:27:29.020]  15 lawsuits I'm under which my lawyers admit are all fake we're getting them
[2:27:29.020 --> 2:27:31.980]  overturned every week but they just follow more they've got big ones I'm
[2:27:31.980 --> 2:27:35.020]  gonna break that are gonna be filed next week I'll break it before they break
[2:27:35.020 --> 2:27:39.260]  I'm gonna be able to know about this what what is this tactic basically they're
[2:27:39.260 --> 2:27:43.460]  harassing you there's no way they can come in on you legitimately your lawyers
[2:27:43.460 --> 2:27:48.380]  will tell you there's no cause of action the basic problem was that they wanted
[2:27:48.380 --> 2:27:52.540]  to take you down and they tried it then what happens Zuckerberg got called into
[2:27:52.540 --> 2:27:58.060]  Congress then what happened YouTube was told to cease and desist so was Google
[2:27:58.060 --> 2:28:03.380]  and suddenly I got monetized so will you and I said to you you will remain on
[2:28:03.380 --> 2:28:07.660]  the air whatever else they want to do that's harassment from my point of view
[2:28:07.660 --> 2:28:11.860]  you're going to remain on I just want you to take it easy because this is part
[2:28:11.860 --> 2:28:17.900]  of the game that occurs when the left and the attackers are have no more options
[2:28:17.900 --> 2:28:22.580]  they're basically scattering it all over the field they have nothing you're talking
[2:28:22.580 --> 2:28:26.540]  about death rows and we're not just saying that these are flailing death
[2:28:26.540 --> 2:28:31.900]  rows that's correct you you're seeing the entity die and they're trying to
[2:28:31.900 --> 2:28:37.760]  be resuscitate through the midterms and bringing in other you know Democrats but
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:41.380]  basically the Ryan's and others who should never been in the first place
[2:28:41.380 --> 2:28:45.220]  really are leaving that's another question why is Ryan evacuating from
[2:28:45.220 --> 2:28:48.740]  your Intel production and then I'm gonna I got a new phone system it's crashing
[2:28:48.740 --> 2:28:52.100]  it's intermittent internet service I'm calling outside group in I'm gonna go

[2:32:58.340 --> 2:33:03.860]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:03.860 --> 2:33:30.340]  all right and again we got a new phone system they're just tweaking it so it's
[2:33:30.340 --> 2:33:33.260]  been up and down today crew's doing a great job actually there's all new
[2:33:33.260 --> 2:33:35.420]  switches I wanted some of these old switches gone actually went to the
[2:33:35.420 --> 2:33:39.140]  control room it's all new phone system in it it's having problems they thought
[2:33:39.140 --> 2:33:41.980]  somebody might have jacked into it or hacked it because that goes on around
[2:33:41.980 --> 2:33:45.740]  here but it was actually one of the Joe Gilbert coming up uses it for his audio
[2:33:45.740 --> 2:33:49.500]  connection so it's a backup so he was logging in so they saw that on the
[2:33:49.500 --> 2:33:52.860]  computer while the system was going down and so we had to change the password a
[2:33:52.860 --> 2:33:55.900]  bunch of the stuff so that's going on here but if you can call back in we'll go
[2:33:55.900 --> 2:34:01.060]  to you I apologize 877-789 alex 877-789-2539
[2:34:01.060 --> 2:34:04.100]  I've just been getting ready to go to your calls twice had the phone system go
[2:34:04.100 --> 2:34:07.660]  down usually goes down like twice every you know six months and be four times a
[2:34:07.660 --> 2:34:11.740]  year it's going down a lot we're gonna fix it now the crew was like this is
[2:34:11.740 --> 2:34:16.300]  great radio really informative but you didn't get back to Israel last segment
[2:34:16.300 --> 2:34:20.540]  get back to Israel on the false flag and so Pachennik was gonna get more into
[2:34:20.540 --> 2:34:24.780]  that but just briefly getting into me and getting into info wars because yeah
[2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:29.260]  we reach 30 40 million people a week during big peak times 50 60 million
[2:34:29.260 --> 2:34:32.820]  sometimes more than that they saw right before the election in the election
[2:34:32.820 --> 2:34:37.060]  Paul Watson was the real star he had videos every week with over 20 million
[2:34:37.060 --> 2:34:41.820]  views a piece I mean there were some videos with 37 million views and then
[2:34:41.820 --> 2:34:45.500]  that was in one week and they would be at 200 million now once you hit above 20
[2:34:45.500 --> 2:34:49.020]  million they just keep climbing and Facebook and YouTube just deleted them
[2:34:49.020 --> 2:34:52.700]  all they don't even give us notice they just go in and all these videos are gone
[2:34:52.700 --> 2:34:56.860]  and so now we're shadow banned down to if you're only on the Facebook or YouTube
[2:34:56.860 --> 2:35:00.540]  if you're on the page you can see it it's still millions people a day we're on
[2:35:00.540 --> 2:35:03.340]  hundreds of radio stations and TV so we're still reaching a lot of people but
[2:35:03.340 --> 2:35:07.660]  they've strangled it a bit but it seeps out it's the Shryzan effect but we're
[2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:12.500]  not that good I mean maybe they see us as a weak target so they think it's a good
[2:35:12.500 --> 2:35:16.580]  poster child they thought that with Trump like use Alex Jones's connection to
[2:35:16.580 --> 2:35:20.100]  Trump to make Trump look bad I talked the campaign and others that ended up
[2:35:20.100 --> 2:35:25.140]  giving him a mystique people want anti-establishment so we're talking 10
[2:35:25.140 --> 2:35:29.580]  different TV shows a week attacking me I mean shows all about the show comedy
[2:35:29.580 --> 2:35:32.500]  central shows where they steal our identity say they're with us and then
[2:35:32.500 --> 2:35:38.020]  say horrible things in our name super deception you know it's the show
[2:35:38.020 --> 2:35:43.260]  homeland all this stuff it goes on and on and it's a total obsession by these
[2:35:43.260 --> 2:35:49.340]  idiots and they don't even get there are now hundreds of channels I know of that
[2:35:49.340 --> 2:35:52.700]  I can't even keep track of that are suddenly getting three four five million
[2:35:52.700 --> 2:35:56.860]  views all basically saying the same thing we're saying so all this attention
[2:35:56.860 --> 2:36:00.980]  censorship to me just eyeballing it looks like it blew up in their face
[2:36:00.980 --> 2:36:05.260]  worse and even in their fake polls Trump's even up more and nationalists
[2:36:05.260 --> 2:36:08.780]  are winning everywhere and populism is coming back and the EU admits it's
[2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:12.900]  about to collapse what's happened here and why are they so obsessed with
[2:36:12.900 --> 2:36:16.860]  info wars is it because you come on or others come on because to me I don't
[2:36:16.860 --> 2:36:21.980]  think it's that big a deal well you are a big deal the issue isn't that you
[2:36:21.980 --> 2:36:26.620]  didn't start out with your grandiosity you started out with a notion that look
[2:36:26.620 --> 2:36:31.300]  I'm gonna say whatever I'm gonna say and I'm gonna say it my way not the New
[2:36:31.300 --> 2:36:35.980]  York time way not the New York post my way is Alex Jones way the two
[2:36:35.980 --> 2:36:40.700]  combination of a paradigm shift you can understand what it is that we're doing
[2:36:40.700 --> 2:36:46.820]  we have literally broken the narrative of the newspaper the narrative of the
[2:36:46.820 --> 2:36:52.700]  three three articles on the one subject they don't know what to say and you
[2:36:52.700 --> 2:36:57.380]  basically came in and said look I don't believe any of this this is how I'm
[2:36:57.380 --> 2:37:02.260]  gonna work it I'm gonna be spontaneous I'm gonna start riffing in my own mind
[2:37:02.260 --> 2:37:08.660]  whatever words come to mind and also be amusing about it that was not that was
[2:37:08.660 --> 2:37:13.020]  not conceivable no one in the press could understand by the way even Colbert
[2:37:13.020 --> 2:37:16.900]  two weeks ago kind of slipped up and he goes with his guests he goes in fours is
[2:37:16.900 --> 2:37:20.940]  so bad because it's creating new narratives and they both look scared
[2:37:20.940 --> 2:37:24.820]  what are they scared of these people are you know what is they don't get to be
[2:37:24.820 --> 2:37:30.260]  their own men they're told what to say remember when you're not your own man
[2:37:30.260 --> 2:37:34.140]  and you have your own business this is why you attract and I attract
[2:37:34.140 --> 2:37:37.900]  entrepreneurs we're not beholden to anybody we're just for holding to our
[2:37:37.900 --> 2:37:42.820]  sales we make the mistakes we fail when you get a guy who's cold bear comes out
[2:37:42.820 --> 2:37:47.060]  of the Stuart show or whatever he's not really that funny he thinks he's funny
[2:37:47.060 --> 2:37:52.300]  and basically he doesn't know what to say he's paid six million dollars to stand
[2:37:52.300 --> 2:37:57.060]  up there like a puppet to say what nobody's interested instead we had a
[2:37:57.060 --> 2:38:01.980]  paradigm shift where the guy named Alex Jones from where Austin Texas well
[2:38:01.980 --> 2:38:07.380]  Austin isn't New York Austin isn't Los Angeles Austin isn't Chicago what in
[2:38:07.380 --> 2:38:11.540]  God's name is in Austin Texas so we have a different person a different
[2:38:11.540 --> 2:38:16.340]  personality a different format a different location then you get a guy his
[2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:21.260]  name is what dr. Steve who Pigeonic he what he left the counts on foreign
[2:38:21.260 --> 2:38:27.020]  relations because he was against the war in Syria and Iran in Iraq I never
[2:38:27.020 --> 2:38:31.500]  heard of that he was an anointed person and then he left and he's joining who
[2:38:31.500 --> 2:38:37.060]  Alex Jones and he's saying what all of those elements combined created a
[2:38:37.060 --> 2:38:42.220]  combustion that basically the system can't contain they don't understand it
[2:38:42.220 --> 2:38:46.380]  and to this day they still don't get that what you and I many others did we
[2:38:46.380 --> 2:38:50.660]  already detonated and now the shockwaves are going out we already sunk to the
[2:38:50.660 --> 2:38:54.460]  bottom even if they take us out we already blew their operation don't they
[2:38:54.460 --> 2:38:58.380]  don't get it they think they can go back and attack the source of the detonation
[2:38:58.380 --> 2:39:04.300]  they can't get it because as you said we've already been decapitated we've
[2:39:04.300 --> 2:39:08.700]  come back we said to them if you pull this stuff again we'll decapitate you
[2:39:08.700 --> 2:39:13.260]  and by the way they did I'm sorry the lady had to kill people at YouTube but
[2:39:13.260 --> 2:39:17.380]  basically that was the expression of frustration that was coming out against
[2:39:17.380 --> 2:39:22.620]  Google and YouTube and when I warned the Soviet Jewish boy who was I took out of
[2:39:22.620 --> 2:39:27.860]  the Soviet Union break and he started to create his own gulag on YouTube and
[2:39:27.860 --> 2:39:31.980]  Google that was a warning to him and ironically you're not just saying that
[2:39:31.980 --> 2:39:36.100]  you you said days before Bloomberg broke that there was a mutiny inside YouTube
[2:39:36.100 --> 2:39:39.100]  and Google and they were gonna fix it everything you said that you knew that
[2:39:39.100 --> 2:39:42.660]  from the Geospatial Center to tell us as much specifics as you can because
[2:39:42.660 --> 2:39:47.700]  that's big well I don't want to get into the new the National Geospatial
[2:39:47.700 --> 2:39:51.540]  Agency all I can tell you it's one of our newest intelligence outfits it's a
[2:39:51.540 --> 2:39:56.300]  brilliant collection of individuals from all over the world these are the guys
[2:39:56.300 --> 2:40:01.660]  who and women by the way it's was headed by a woman that you said you said
[2:40:01.660 --> 2:40:05.860]  they're being told right now they're not gonna turn Google into a gulag and
[2:40:05.860 --> 2:40:10.300]  then what you yeah and the reason for that is there was a gentleman by her
[2:40:10.300 --> 2:40:14.580]  name of Keith Alexander General Keith Alexander whom I worked with with well
[2:40:14.580 --> 2:40:19.500]  he was in G2 but he was head of the NSA now he has his own private consulting
[2:40:19.500 --> 2:40:23.900]  but he asked the question that the National Geospatial Agency really had
[2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:29.340]  to answer an entity and that was what is the third dimension of the Internet we
[2:40:29.340 --> 2:40:34.620]  know the ones the zeros but what is life within the Internet in its depth and
[2:40:34.620 --> 2:40:40.140]  horizontal levels it's deep how deep does it go how far does it go and a whole
[2:40:40.140 --> 2:40:44.580]  institution was created to answer that third question well it's an interface
[2:40:44.580 --> 2:40:50.180]  into human activity in the future and so it's actually a nexus into the third
[2:40:50.180 --> 2:40:55.340]  dimension and above that it's a it's a it's a giant brain melding machine now
[2:40:55.340 --> 2:40:59.940]  you got it now we not only have the Internet but we have AI artificial
[2:40:59.940 --> 2:41:05.500]  intelligence working on AI artificial intelligence we have quantum encryption
[2:41:05.500 --> 2:41:10.460]  which is a new concept but I kept saying it for months here and elsewhere that
[2:41:10.460 --> 2:41:15.780]  basically we no longer just codify anything we do it at a quantum level
[2:41:15.780 --> 2:41:20.900]  and the ones who are doing this along us along with us is other Chinese they're
[2:41:20.900 --> 2:41:24.740]  very good and I'll say how come the Democrats and these old thinkers with
[2:41:24.740 --> 2:41:29.340]  one-dimensional thinking where they do a not thinking about how it moves know
[2:41:29.340 --> 2:41:32.180]  that other people like Trump and others now with their own instinct but also with
[2:41:32.180 --> 2:41:36.060]  computers can actually look forward 20 moves I don't I think it makes me feel
[2:41:36.060 --> 2:41:39.860]  pathetic that the globalists were in power this long when they're that
[2:41:39.860 --> 2:41:44.860]  pathetic why were we that weak to let them do this we weren't that weak we
[2:41:44.860 --> 2:41:50.300]  basically had to respect the geriatric unit yet Diane Feinstein 84 you have
[2:41:50.300 --> 2:41:57.020]  Soros 87 you have Pelosi 79 you have McCain who's an idiot and a war
[2:41:57.020 --> 2:42:01.660]  criminal I mean this is what happened it had to be cleaned out by the people of
[2:42:01.660 --> 2:42:06.060]  the United States you and I could target them you and I could go after them
[2:42:06.060 --> 2:42:10.820]  verbally and then eventually they were spotted but it's like anything else a
[2:42:10.820 --> 2:42:15.660]  revolution takes place but it's going much faster than you would have imagined
[2:42:15.660 --> 2:42:20.900]  when we first started 17 years ago you and I didn't know we would be on quite
[2:42:20.900 --> 2:42:25.740]  frankly there were people who threatened me the FBI gave me subpoenas where I had
[2:42:25.740 --> 2:42:31.740]  to show up but before a prosecutor you and turn you had to show up the court so
[2:42:31.740 --> 2:42:35.660]  it was an endless series of fights that we had to live they're basically a
[2:42:35.660 --> 2:42:40.820]  geriatric unit with very little memory and very little thinking capacity that's
[2:42:40.820 --> 2:42:43.860]  right and they think they're gonna whack us on the head we're gonna go away it's
[2:42:43.860 --> 2:42:47.940]  it's the other way around it's the other way around the more they hit us the
[2:42:47.940 --> 2:42:52.740]  better it is because it makes us more important they created their own monster
[2:42:52.740 --> 2:42:57.180]  welcome that's right we'll be back with your call stay with us

[2:43:56.060 --> 2:44:00.740]  senator Rand Paul is warning that the Trump haters at the FBI still have their
[2:44:00.740 --> 2:44:05.020]  top secret security clearance the senator is demanding that exposed enemies of
[2:44:05.020 --> 2:44:09.220]  president Trump should be fired Paul tweeted out a copy of a response he was
[2:44:09.220 --> 2:44:13.740]  sent in March to an earlier letter where he asked whether FBI agent Peter
[2:44:13.740 --> 2:44:19.060]  struck an FBI lawyer Lisa Page still had security clearances and the response
[2:44:19.060 --> 2:44:24.300]  from FBI assistant director Gregory Brower reads all FBI employees must
[2:44:24.300 --> 2:44:29.020]  maintain a top-secret security clearance on a Fox News appearance senator Paul
[2:44:29.020 --> 2:44:33.020]  warned that this potentially means that the exposed officials who called Trump
[2:44:33.020 --> 2:44:38.020]  an idiot and a lonesome human and talked about an FBI secret society and an
[2:44:38.020 --> 2:44:42.620]  insurance policy for if Trump was elected can still access information
[2:44:42.620 --> 2:44:46.380]  regarding the investigation posing a potential threat to national security
[2:44:46.380 --> 2:44:50.500]  Paul said Peter struck and Lisa Page were exposed as enemies of president
[2:44:50.500 --> 2:44:55.860]  Trump and they need to be fired. Lee and McAdoo Infowars.com
[2:44:55.860 --> 2:45:00.900]  they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach
[2:45:00.900 --> 2:45:05.300]  children that their president is another Hitler they use their movie stars and
[2:45:05.300 --> 2:45:09.700]  singers and comedy shows and awards shows to repeat their narrative over and
[2:45:09.700 --> 2:45:14.220]  over again and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance
[2:45:14.220 --> 2:45:20.180]  all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and
[2:45:20.180 --> 2:45:24.940]  xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down
[2:45:24.940 --> 2:45:29.180]  interstates and airports bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the
[2:45:29.180 --> 2:45:35.220]  only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness and when
[2:45:35.220 --> 2:45:40.540]  that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop
[2:45:40.540 --> 2:45:46.660]  this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence
[2:45:46.660 --> 2:45:52.340]  of lies with a clenched fist of truth I'm the National Rifle Association of
[2:45:52.340 --> 2:45:57.820]  America and I'm freedom's safest place. After years of research working with top
[2:45:57.820 --> 2:46:02.460]  developers here in the United States with the latest cutting-edge science we
[2:46:02.460 --> 2:46:09.300]  are rolling out three new digestive gut aids one of them is a powerful pro
[2:46:09.300 --> 2:46:14.220]  digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down meat other proteins
[2:46:14.220 --> 2:46:20.060]  better and then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic
[2:46:20.060 --> 2:46:25.540]  culture of the very best strains in fluorolife advanced restoration and we
[2:46:25.540 --> 2:46:30.300]  also have an everyday extremely affordable fluorolife everyday maintenance
[2:46:30.300 --> 2:46:36.700]  but all of these are the very cutting-edge top-of-the-line probiotics and
[2:46:36.700 --> 2:46:42.580]  digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price that is my goal here
[2:46:42.580 --> 2:46:47.500]  is to bring you the very best at the lowest price when you purchase it and
[2:46:47.500 --> 2:46:52.420]  then for store.com you know you are also financing the attack on the globalist
[2:46:52.420 --> 2:47:00.180]  and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide you're listening to
[2:47:00.180 --> 2:47:03.740]  the Alex Jones show
[2:47:03.740 --> 2:47:23.500]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones. I want to be clear
[2:47:23.500 --> 2:47:26.500]  the reason I brought this up for Dr. C. Buchennick is I know he has some of the
[2:47:26.500 --> 2:47:29.660]  best sources out there he's been so accurate over the 17 years I've been
[2:47:29.660 --> 2:47:35.140]  talking to him hard to believe it's been that long since 2002 it was early 2002 I
[2:47:35.140 --> 2:47:39.380]  first heard interviewing him and he was saying bin Laden was dead now they bring
[2:47:39.380 --> 2:47:42.340]  him out on ice later and I've talked to Navy SEALs and people that weren't blown
[2:47:42.340 --> 2:47:46.300]  up from dev group and they they just say that they're not gonna talk but yeah
[2:47:46.300 --> 2:47:53.020]  that it's all fake well just to say stuff like that on there it's really
[2:47:53.020 --> 2:47:58.700]  dangerous so people know I mean it's but this was just handed to me BuzzFeed
[2:47:58.700 --> 2:48:05.780]  news how YouTube channel recommends and pushes users to the French and then BuzzFeed
[2:48:05.780 --> 2:48:08.780]  the people who gave me the PP dossier and all the rest of it major Soros
[2:48:08.780 --> 2:48:14.100]  funded say look related channels info wars.com Alex Jones now they've got a
[2:48:14.100 --> 2:48:18.620]  shadow band still they're blocking us because there's a mutiny in YouTube but
[2:48:18.620 --> 2:48:25.100]  imagine them openly calling the old Google algorithm is what's most popular
[2:48:25.100 --> 2:48:29.580]  is what's promoted it's called YouTube now for a while YouTube's gotten rid of
[2:48:29.580 --> 2:48:32.220]  the original algorithm and it basically broke it that's what the search results
[2:48:32.220 --> 2:48:35.860]  didn't work for but last few months now they're kind of in between it bringing it
[2:48:35.860 --> 2:48:39.620]  back there is a war inside it but Jenick knows the details from his sources
[2:48:39.620 --> 2:48:44.140]  and agencies he obviously won't tell us but he did say this was gonna happen but
[2:48:44.140 --> 2:48:46.820]  there's two points of them are going to calls there's the announcement that I
[2:48:46.820 --> 2:48:49.820]  need to be banned from the internet and he platform that it's bad to let people
[2:48:49.820 --> 2:48:54.220]  see my search results when Google is unrecognizable to what it used to be just
[2:48:54.220 --> 2:48:58.140]  a year ago it's just it's just horrible it's it's kind of gone back a little bit
[2:48:58.140 --> 2:49:02.140]  you see they're testing when Bing and things like Microsoft are much better
[2:49:02.140 --> 2:49:06.780]  but endorsing Microsoft so there's the separate issue of I know you how much
[2:49:06.780 --> 2:49:09.420]  and then I got to go to Catherine and Carlos who's got the phone system back
[2:49:09.420 --> 2:49:12.380]  up I promise we're going to we're doing 15 minutes the next hours we go to
[2:49:12.380 --> 2:49:15.460]  everybody but I'm going to people in a few minutes I gotta know as much as you
[2:49:15.460 --> 2:49:18.460]  did call it you said it's gonna be restored it's not gonna happen it's
[2:49:18.460 --> 2:49:22.780]  gonna be cleaned up there's a mutiny inside it you know it's it's it's it's
[2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:27.860]  Obama stay behinds they're being cleaned out it is admitted in QTEL and the
[2:49:27.860 --> 2:49:31.060]  NASA bases and all of it that you know Google was founded based with NSA
[2:49:31.060 --> 2:49:33.940]  technology it's a public-private partnership for national security I
[2:49:33.940 --> 2:49:38.260]  get it it was it was a DARPA projection that's actually in the you know the
[2:49:38.260 --> 2:49:41.860]  white papers people don't really see that but that's admitted so I knew when
[2:49:41.860 --> 2:49:45.140]  you said that days before it was admitted that there was some historical
[2:49:45.140 --> 2:49:48.260]  accuracy but then when it happened and we got restored and it's taking them a
[2:49:48.260 --> 2:49:53.060]  month to go through natural news and thousands of other sites and restore them
[2:49:53.060 --> 2:49:56.060]  somebody restores them then somebody goes in and deletes the subscribers somebody
[2:49:56.060 --> 2:49:59.900]  puts the subscribers back in when you've got an infrastructure this big this is a
[2:49:59.900 --> 2:50:04.700]  crazy civil war inside Google so what can you tell us about the civil war inside
[2:50:04.700 --> 2:50:10.140]  Google this is just intriguing what's really happening inside Google is that
[2:50:10.140 --> 2:50:14.420]  they're going to be losing a lot of their clients as well as the cash flows
[2:50:14.420 --> 2:50:21.100]  what happened when Zuckerberg came and testified in Congress it basically tanked
[2:50:21.100 --> 2:50:27.020]  Facebook in terms of values if you look at Google and it's a cumulation
[2:50:27.020 --> 2:50:32.340]  distribution in the stock market it has what we call a DDE rating meaning that
[2:50:32.340 --> 2:50:36.980]  nobody wants to accumulate the stock and it's basically a dead ass and isn't that
[2:50:36.980 --> 2:50:41.300]  a warning to them for their treason just like Trump just drove down Amazon 34
[2:50:41.300 --> 2:50:46.500]  million well that's exactly the point but when when you don't have investors
[2:50:46.500 --> 2:50:51.140]  particularly the the big investors on Wall Street and elsewhere or I played
[2:50:51.140 --> 2:50:55.500]  investors don't want to invest in authoritarianism it sucks no no and
[2:50:55.500 --> 2:50:59.180]  that's the point not only don't they want to invest in authoritarianism they
[2:50:59.180 --> 2:51:03.300]  know this is antiquated they know that there are other algorithms that are
[2:51:03.300 --> 2:51:08.300]  coming in at a much faster rate where we can break Google we can break Facebook we
[2:51:08.300 --> 2:51:12.420]  can break any one of these things and they know it the YouTube and Google
[2:51:12.420 --> 2:51:16.500]  province really gave them chances to move forward they didn't and now they're
[2:51:16.500 --> 2:51:21.900]  going to be put to death politically I I think so politically and economically
[2:51:21.900 --> 2:51:25.980]  because Zuckerberg should have been thrown out if you were in any way part of
[2:51:25.980 --> 2:51:31.380]  the Sandy Road or Sandy Hill hedge fund I would have thrown out Zuckerberg even
[2:51:31.380 --> 2:51:34.780]  though he's the majority holder he's a disaster oh it's like Kaisers you're not
[2:51:34.780 --> 2:51:40.580]  under the Goldwater rules was diagnosing but he is one of the weirdest any top
[2:51:40.580 --> 2:51:45.460]  actor could act like a robot like him the narcissistic little Jewish boy who
[2:51:45.460 --> 2:51:50.380]  copied a lot of things went out of his way to get a movie called social network
[2:51:50.380 --> 2:51:55.540]  was not that brilliant created a story in the narrative like a hundred of these
[2:51:55.540 --> 2:52:00.940]  guys basically he's not the genius the genius were the people in the CIA and
[2:52:00.940 --> 2:52:06.420]  DARPA when they saw this in the 50s and see about my dad saw it in when he was
[2:52:06.420 --> 2:52:10.900]  just at UT and the plan to when he was in high school they were showing you CD
[2:52:10.900 --> 2:52:16.380]  roms and social networks and info G and everything all you have in Zuckerberg is
[2:52:16.380 --> 2:52:20.860]  a promoter a self-promoter he didn't do anything that was unusual he didn't
[2:52:20.860 --> 2:52:25.100]  create anything that was unusual if you look at social network you'll see where
[2:52:25.100 --> 2:52:29.740]  he stole a lot of things were in fact he's a faulted character it's a little
[2:52:29.740 --> 2:52:32.260]  bright about my dad he always talked about what he's the thing was most
[2:52:32.260 --> 2:52:35.180]  proud of was he was like a senior in high school he wrote a paper called
[2:52:35.180 --> 2:52:39.780]  information energy or info G that then got snatched up he said by DARPA and
[2:52:39.780 --> 2:52:42.460]  they asked him never to talk about it but but I mean I'm sure other people were
[2:52:42.460 --> 2:52:45.860]  simultaneously saying the same thing but my dad was talking about social networks
[2:52:45.860 --> 2:52:50.820]  in like 1967 well the only thing he should have done is while he was a
[2:52:50.820 --> 2:52:54.740]  dentist he should have started up a company in Austin and I wish him the
[2:52:54.740 --> 2:52:59.620]  best but the genes clearly come through to you you're bright you see it you
[2:52:59.620 --> 2:53:03.580]  understand about me I'm just saying I don't know why they're attacking us you
[2:53:03.580 --> 2:53:08.340]  know what you have to understand it's not just you I compare you to the to the
[2:53:08.340 --> 2:53:13.020]  left and to Congress they're dead the brain dead they don't get any of this
[2:53:13.020 --> 2:53:17.500]  they don't understand it they sit among themselves it's like a circle of
[2:53:17.500 --> 2:53:21.940]  geriatric patients talking about nonsense whereas we're on the outside
[2:53:21.940 --> 2:53:26.820]  accumulating information at a very fast rate and they could not absorb it there's
[2:53:26.820 --> 2:53:30.180]  no way they can that's why they got rid of humid is because they didn't want us
[2:53:30.180 --> 2:53:34.100]  to have the original humid and then they rely only on the technocracy which
[2:53:34.100 --> 2:53:39.500]  there's so much info it blinds them well but also they didn't have a character
[2:53:39.500 --> 2:53:44.340]  like Alex Jones to be able to articulate the narrative with passion
[2:53:44.340 --> 2:53:50.420]  humor and zeal and more importantly a resistance that's the one thing that you
[2:53:50.420 --> 2:53:53.780]  cannot see on television it's the one thing you don't see in the movie
[2:53:53.780 --> 2:53:58.060]  business it's the one thing you don't see in politics they stay there for a few
[2:53:58.060 --> 2:54:02.340]  years to get their pension and then they leave you don't go into politics if
[2:54:02.340 --> 2:54:07.380]  you're an entrepreneur you're a creator like yourself you want to break all the
[2:54:07.380 --> 2:54:11.380]  paradigms or at least have an American Revolution you don't go into politics
[2:54:11.380 --> 2:54:16.340]  today that's basically I saw the socialist globalist dirtbag revolution
[2:54:16.340 --> 2:54:19.460]  and had to resist it just like our audience does and they're all awesome
[2:54:19.460 --> 2:54:22.420]  for holding Dr. C. Pachennick C. Pachennick.com's almost find his books
[2:54:22.420 --> 2:54:25.820]  there on the site really smart guy and he's he's not BS he's got the connections
[2:54:25.820 --> 2:54:30.020]  so many times he's just got amazing info for us so does Zach who I want to get
[2:54:30.020 --> 2:54:33.620]  back on as soon as possible we know his identity great info as well
[2:54:33.620 --> 2:54:36.860]  Catherine in Canada thanks for holding and then Carlos and others you're on the
[2:54:36.860 --> 2:54:42.060]  air worldwide during the 34-hour emergency broadcast. Hi Alex how are you?
[2:54:42.060 --> 2:54:46.580]  I'm doing all right pretty crazy world how are you doing I'm glad that Trump's
[2:54:46.580 --> 2:54:51.500]  backing off World War three talk. Yeah no I think that's all theater actually but
[2:54:51.500 --> 2:54:57.140]  I have a point to do about Comey. So I just want to make a point about if the
[2:54:57.140 --> 2:55:01.660]  Russians were trying to blackmail the incoming president why wouldn't the FBI
[2:55:01.660 --> 2:55:05.900]  and Comey himself do everything in their power to protect him from the blackmail
[2:55:05.900 --> 2:55:11.060]  but instead use it intimidated him with the information that just blows up yeah
[2:55:11.060 --> 2:55:14.500]  that was true that's collusion with the Russians if the president really did it
[2:55:14.500 --> 2:55:18.180]  because the national security the CIA would be trying to block that and deal
[2:55:18.180 --> 2:55:22.180]  with it instead of the FBI using it and of course they funded the whole fake
[2:55:22.180 --> 2:55:29.580]  thing. Dr. Pritchett? Useless organization I told you 30 years ago I had it come in
[2:55:29.580 --> 2:55:33.220]  under the Carter administration to take over the Hanafi Muslim where the FBI
[2:55:33.220 --> 2:55:37.260]  didn't have the profile couldn't repel didn't know what to do and they were
[2:55:37.260 --> 2:55:41.460]  just totally useless it's an organization that should be shut down by
[2:55:41.460 --> 2:55:46.140]  Trump automatically he should fire Mueller he should fire Rodenstein he
[2:55:46.140 --> 2:55:50.980]  should shut down the FBI reconstructed or leave it there we have the ATF we have
[2:55:50.980 --> 2:55:54.940]  only it's about to say let's let her finish they have built Mueller up like
[2:55:54.940 --> 2:55:58.940]  he's the shadow president and they're rogue completely Trump has a
[2:55:58.940 --> 2:56:02.260]  responsibility to fire him I know people say won't do that it makes them look
[2:56:02.260 --> 2:56:06.540]  like he's guilty at a certain point where are the indictments what's up with
[2:56:06.540 --> 2:56:10.180]  Rosenstein where is the stuff with Mueller getting in trouble for covering up
[2:56:10.180 --> 2:56:15.980]  for Hillary I mean it's ridiculous we did not elect Robert Mueller I agree with
[2:56:15.980 --> 2:56:20.260]  you that's why I was asking to fire him years ago the man is corrupt he was
[2:56:20.260 --> 2:56:25.460]  compromised in 9-eleven he took over the FBI a week before 9-eleven this was a
[2:56:25.460 --> 2:56:31.060]  former Vietnam War hero who compromised himself and made it disgusting he
[2:56:31.060 --> 2:56:35.940]  basically is corrupt and the deputy director tried to stop it and then he
[2:56:35.940 --> 2:56:39.620]  took a job at the World Trade Center and died the day of the attack well there
[2:56:39.620 --> 2:56:43.500]  was another person unfortunately who died it was a CIA operative named John
[2:56:43.500 --> 2:56:47.820]  Neal and he knew exactly what was going on and he died there they had no yeah
[2:56:47.820 --> 2:56:50.900]  that's John O'Neill the deputy head of counterterrorism for the FBI but you're
[2:56:50.900 --> 2:56:58.340]  now saying he was CIA yes yeah so the whole point is is that that's how
[2:56:58.340 --> 2:57:00.620]  crazy this is there are good people in the government
[2:57:00.620 --> 2:57:05.520]  Catherine go ahead and finish up I just think when the inspector general's
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:09.260]  report starts to drop portions of it I think their whole in its narrative is
[2:57:09.260 --> 2:57:12.820]  gonna blow up and I think you might see some indictments by then I think they're
[2:57:12.820 --> 2:57:17.100]  waiting for the Comey book to counter it with the OIG no I agree that's when
[2:57:17.100 --> 2:57:21.260]  Trump punches back I want to ask Dr. Corsi when we come back though we're
[2:57:21.260 --> 2:57:24.820]  trying not Dr. Corsi I'm gonna get Dr. Corsi's coming up later today on the
[2:57:24.820 --> 2:57:27.540]  show I'm on the show I think during the war and that's why I said that Dr.
[2:57:27.540 --> 2:57:34.340]  Pachennick C-Pachennick.com I want to ask him about what do we do though if they
[2:57:34.340 --> 2:57:37.500]  kill Trump or they stage a bunch more false flags because we know they're
[2:57:37.500 --> 2:57:41.660]  desperate they're crazy they have the strength of crazy criminals what do we
[2:57:41.660 --> 2:57:46.380]  do about that if they start a civil war because they could go that way the
[2:57:46.380 --> 2:57:49.500]  reason in forward's life has five star ratings on major third-party sites is
[2:57:49.500 --> 2:57:53.380]  because I want products I'm gonna use for my family I take this my family takes

[3:00:26.540 --> 3:00:29.780]  segment the next one right to your calls I just wanted to ask Dr. Pachennick of
[3:00:29.780 --> 3:00:35.700]  Steve Pachennick.com looking at this the Democrats are hashtag hunt
[3:00:35.700 --> 3:00:39.660]  Republicans we've got documents that we've confirmed are real towards Soros
[3:00:39.660 --> 3:00:42.420]  has a deny them his son has denied them that they're trying to cause race war
[3:00:42.420 --> 3:00:45.700]  shibble war on the streets they've not been successful with how they work with
[3:00:45.700 --> 3:00:49.780]  blue city Democrat police departments where they're knocking windows out and
[3:00:49.780 --> 3:00:53.700]  trash cans but it's it's scripted they have a threat continuum it's all planned
[3:00:53.700 --> 3:00:56.980]  out they're trying to get other people to get violent we published that months
[3:00:56.980 --> 3:01:01.660]  ago I mean this is serious criminal activity so I get we don't want to be
[3:01:01.660 --> 3:01:06.420]  too precipitous to clean them out I'm not an authoritarian I'm a libertarian
[3:01:06.420 --> 3:01:11.340]  but I feel derelict watching them do this and them trying to gear up a coup
[3:01:11.340 --> 3:01:16.140]  and and just all the wild eyedness that's going on and trying to sabotage the
[3:01:16.140 --> 3:01:20.780]  economy and we have a clear and present danger a book you wrote turn into a
[3:01:20.780 --> 3:01:26.100]  movie here in this country and I don't want to underestimate these people that's
[3:01:26.100 --> 3:01:30.820]  all I'm saying what keeps you awake at night dr. Pachennick I mean I know we're
[3:01:30.820 --> 3:01:36.740]  winning overall Americana free market worldwide but they could grab picked
[3:01:36.740 --> 3:01:40.460]  from the jaws of defeat and I don't want to also get my ideas because I used to
[3:01:40.460 --> 3:01:43.060]  think they were smarter or else they're just dumb but they're like cancer
[3:01:43.060 --> 3:01:45.900]  willing to take over that's why they're in power but how are they going to
[3:01:45.900 --> 3:01:50.940]  strike back what do we do if they start killing people or they stage a bunch of
[3:01:50.940 --> 3:01:54.100]  more false flags we know they're doing that we know they're winding it up
[3:01:54.100 --> 3:01:58.420]  preparing it lining the people up standing down I mean and they're so
[3:01:58.420 --> 3:02:02.860]  pissed we're exposing that that tells me that they want me discredited ahead of
[3:02:02.860 --> 3:02:06.100]  the next narrative they launch they don't even get to the actual tune even
[3:02:06.100 --> 3:02:10.220]  more they're just so they had this I hear the psychiatrist is narcissism where
[3:02:10.220 --> 3:02:13.580]  they they think they're invincible but that's their weakness and their strength
[3:02:13.580 --> 3:02:19.220]  isn't it no it's more of their weakness it's not even an issue of narcissism
[3:02:19.220 --> 3:02:24.740]  it's grandiosity that really has no basis in reality all they're doing is the
[3:02:24.740 --> 3:02:31.140]  tighter they become on the target which is yourself me or Trump target psychosis
[3:02:31.140 --> 3:02:37.900]  I'm sorry target psychosis well we say you're fixation on a target that's
[3:02:37.900 --> 3:02:42.500]  basically what we say in the military say you missed the entire target and at
[3:02:42.500 --> 3:02:47.900]  the same time while they're focusing in there being on Trump he's being able to
[3:02:47.900 --> 3:02:53.380]  retaliate so fast that it and it's not only the Democrats what he's done is to
[3:02:53.380 --> 3:02:57.580]  make sure Ryan oh yeah why is Paul Ryan leaving I forgot that question yeah I
[3:02:57.580 --> 3:03:01.100]  mean this is not an accident he predicted six months ago that he'd be
[3:03:01.100 --> 3:03:06.780]  going correct and I said there would be 20 to 25 different Republicans so called
[3:03:06.780 --> 3:03:11.620]  Republicans who are moderates or didn't support Tom have no idea what he's doing
[3:03:11.620 --> 3:03:15.900]  have no idea where the Republican and they're leaving and that was part of his
[3:03:15.900 --> 3:03:20.380]  agenda except he didn't say it's outright he said you're either with me or
[3:03:20.380 --> 3:03:25.540]  against me but the tighter you come in on him the more effective he becomes and
[3:03:25.540 --> 3:03:31.340]  that's why you myself and I what keeps me up at night not really very much I go
[3:03:31.340 --> 3:03:36.780]  up the next day and I say okay is my garbage can't gone no I just don't here's
[3:03:36.780 --> 3:03:40.180]  the thing we can all put a good face on it and things are things are going our
[3:03:40.180 --> 3:03:43.460]  way the worms turning but they are bullying the hell out of individuals
[3:03:43.460 --> 3:03:48.220]  that this bats I mean I want to I want to look at the negative position here the
[3:03:48.220 --> 3:03:53.340]  negative position is basically that they were a repetition again and again it's
[3:03:53.340 --> 3:03:57.340]  almost repetition compulsion of a neurotic or a psychotic person they
[3:03:57.340 --> 3:04:02.420]  repeat the same thing so mantra there's a mantra correct it's a mantra he's
[3:04:02.420 --> 3:04:06.820]  lazy he's tired he doesn't know what to do it was on the New York Times he's crazy
[3:04:06.820 --> 3:04:10.260]  he's stupid he needs to not listen to that he's a stop reading the New York
[3:04:10.260 --> 3:04:16.380]  Times not really because what happens in turn it's really paradoxical intention
[3:04:16.380 --> 3:04:19.900]  I'd like him to listen to it because what he does makes you come back stronger
[3:04:19.900 --> 3:04:25.060]  he comes back stronger and then you see the real Twitter war where he comes in
[3:04:25.060 --> 3:04:29.380]  and he will devastate people right and left and they don't really understand
[3:04:29.380 --> 3:04:33.740]  what happened so they think he's uncontrollable no he's very controllable
[3:04:33.740 --> 3:04:38.500]  it's only he has to depend on what time he does it he has to listen to his
[3:04:38.500 --> 3:04:43.700]  friends or as Lendasky and stone and said let him be let him be Trump he's
[3:04:43.700 --> 3:04:47.460]  gonna be what he is he built a billion-dollar business he went out of
[3:04:47.460 --> 3:04:52.060]  his way to build us his way we'll be back with Carlos Jeff Ryan Matt David and
[3:04:52.060 --> 3:04:58.700]  Nemo stay there I'm so excited the new product at m4slife.com in a glass
[3:04:58.700 --> 3:05:04.500]  bottle two month servings filled to the brim filled to the absolute top the real
[3:05:04.500 --> 3:05:10.100]  red bill this is a heart and brain pill a new tropic that doesn't have any
[3:05:10.100 --> 3:05:13.980]  stimulants in it but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that
[3:05:13.980 --> 3:05:19.780]  quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their
[3:05:19.780 --> 3:05:23.340]  patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred
[3:05:23.340 --> 3:05:28.500]  two hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formula working
[3:05:28.500 --> 3:05:33.460]  with some scientists and developers non-gmo made right here in America 120
[3:05:33.460 --> 3:05:38.860]  capsules and ladies and gentlemen you add the preglinone to it which is the
[3:05:38.860 --> 3:05:43.060]  precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[3:05:43.060 --> 3:05:49.980]  hormones in your glands it is amazing red pill now available at m4warstore.com
[3:05:49.980 --> 3:06:05.300]  and your purchase fugs the operation
[3:06:05.300 --> 3:06:12.620]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's Alex Jones
[3:06:12.620 --> 3:06:17.780]  all right I get so wrapped up in target fixation I don't even plug last hour and
[3:06:17.780 --> 3:06:23.660]  why wouldn't I one plug can deal with one of these lawsuits and that's the good
[3:06:23.660 --> 3:06:27.140]  news the bad news is they've they got noticed that two more to be filed next
[3:06:27.140 --> 3:06:32.060]  week these are bigger they're still frauds we had I got corrected yesterday
[3:06:32.060 --> 3:06:36.180]  but lawyers we had to dismiss last week one was about a thousand almost 10,000
[3:06:36.180 --> 3:06:39.940]  in lawyers fees to get a dismissed and I mean but these these lawyer mills just
[3:06:39.940 --> 3:06:44.740]  turn up the heat and just it's like all former Clinton lawyers and Soros
[3:06:44.740 --> 3:06:50.860]  people we've got to do slapback suits to punish them and to get the money back
[3:06:50.860 --> 3:06:55.420]  and that's what's gonna cost the real money or they'll just keep filing them
[3:06:55.420 --> 3:07:04.740]  into infinity like a hall of mirrors so I look you know my dad's older uncle went
[3:07:04.740 --> 3:07:09.220]  down a boat carrying weapons to England in World War two and had family died in
[3:07:09.220 --> 3:07:14.180]  Vietnam they had really tough jobs with all the foot rot and the VCs and you
[3:07:14.180 --> 3:07:18.260]  know in Korean war everything so I'm not a hero I'm really blessed to be fighting
[3:07:18.260 --> 3:07:21.420]  these people and just have Soros suing me and stuff I mean I'm glad to have it
[3:07:21.420 --> 3:07:24.860]  since my to kill me but they know they're being watched they know they can't
[3:07:24.860 --> 3:07:27.620]  get away with that now it's a 21st century war I'm just saying it's an
[3:07:27.620 --> 3:07:32.260]  epic time to be alive we have the very best deep earth I and I nobody else has
[3:07:32.260 --> 3:07:36.100]  it people trying to figure that out now companies are coming in wanting to buy it
[3:07:36.100 --> 3:07:39.260]  up it's about to be in shampoos and stuff that a major company's gonna put out
[3:07:39.260 --> 3:07:43.100]  I can tell you that's why they just jacked up the price on us and then they say
[3:07:43.100 --> 3:07:46.700]  we might even have it for you so we've already called more than ten oil
[3:07:46.700 --> 3:07:50.580]  companies that get distillates and derivatives and things and you know
[3:07:50.580 --> 3:07:54.460]  different mineral extractions it's just getting a shadow of the wells thirty
[3:07:54.460 --> 3:07:57.540]  million dollars a drill some ten thousand foot well get them to stop and
[3:07:57.540 --> 3:08:01.860]  grab deep earth iodine is a big deal even though we saw a lot of it we're
[3:08:01.860 --> 3:08:06.460]  showing on it's been a market compared to oil and gas so this is pure true
[3:08:06.460 --> 3:08:10.900]  atomic iodine nobody else has it we had folks harass us and try to stop us five
[3:08:10.900 --> 3:08:13.820]  years ago to kill our clean seaweed version that was a lot weaker but still
[3:08:13.820 --> 3:08:17.820]  pure but it wasn't atomic so we ended up getting this just by the grace of God
[3:08:17.820 --> 3:08:21.780]  well it could be over and believe me I'm not happy about that we're about to
[3:08:21.780 --> 3:08:25.620]  sell out of it we got maybe two more runs we can do but those that shipments
[3:08:25.620 --> 3:08:28.980]  already going up it's got to be kept in a DEA facility in Houston and then it's
[3:08:28.980 --> 3:08:33.100]  made a special lab because pure iodine obviously has other uses once it's put
[3:08:33.100 --> 3:08:39.060]  in the palm oil it doesn't but it's it's it's key to IQ stamina energy it's
[3:08:39.060 --> 3:08:42.940]  made me lazy I was swimming two miles every other day everything and couldn't
[3:08:42.940 --> 3:08:47.260]  lose weight six years ago I went on pure atomic iodine and it was just like I
[3:08:47.260 --> 3:08:50.620]  lost 40 pounds it just made me lazy I haven't worked out this week and I'm
[3:08:50.620 --> 3:08:53.820]  skinner and I was you know six seven years ago I mean I'm good up I'm a
[3:08:53.820 --> 3:08:58.260]  pusky guy but I'm I've actually lost a lot of weight in Full War store.com
[3:08:58.260 --> 3:09:03.220]  in FullWarsLive.com and on Monday I'm gonna go back to full price which is 40
[3:09:03.220 --> 3:09:08.020]  bucks and again we don't put seven time markups on these products we put on
[3:09:08.020 --> 3:09:11.940]  average about a hundred fifty percent that's one and a half markup I'm thinking
[3:09:11.940 --> 3:09:14.700]  about not doing that anymore just because of all the globalist operations I
[3:09:14.700 --> 3:09:17.700]  want to give you know and I could play the game of raising the price then
[3:09:17.700 --> 3:09:21.740]  lowering it and saying it's 50% off when we say 50% off it's really 50%
[3:09:21.740 --> 3:09:25.580]  awful it's 25% off right now that's about the end body's ultimate tumor
[3:09:25.580 --> 3:09:29.660]  formulas back in stock great anti-inflammatory that's there so many
[3:09:29.660 --> 3:09:33.460]  other products the alpha powers back in stock 25% off you get free shipping on
[3:09:33.460 --> 3:09:37.900]  orders $50 or more but just know this you cannot give the globalist a
[3:09:37.900 --> 3:09:42.140]  bigger black eye and stand up against them and supporting free speech because
[3:09:42.140 --> 3:09:45.580]  they see this show and our guests as a constellation of resistance and
[3:09:45.580 --> 3:09:48.940]  information that's so close to what's really going on not that we're perfect
[3:09:48.940 --> 3:09:52.820]  we all see through rose-colored glasses that they want it shut down and I grew
[3:09:52.820 --> 3:09:57.860]  up a chenic the one dimensional thing of crushing us when we were already did
[3:09:57.860 --> 3:10:01.100]  our job we still want to be here and still want to help and all the rest of
[3:10:01.100 --> 3:10:05.260]  it but there's a real satisfaction in being the rock that hits the pond because
[3:10:05.260 --> 3:10:08.940]  your parents and your ancestors in the culture got you there they threw you you
[3:10:08.940 --> 3:10:13.020]  hit and then the waves have already gone back and bounce back and by then they
[3:10:13.020 --> 3:10:16.140]  realize that you see a hundred more rocks about to hit they don't even see
[3:10:16.140 --> 3:10:19.500]  the hundred other rocks in the air they're worried about crushing the spot
[3:10:19.500 --> 3:10:23.620]  where the rock hit 23 years ago and they don't even get that already it's an
[3:10:23.620 --> 3:10:27.620]  exponential wave that quite frankly that wave Dr. Pachett will go to call scares
[3:10:27.620 --> 3:10:33.500]  me because the unknown things that are going to happen and how the in trench
[3:10:33.500 --> 3:10:37.840]  bureaucracy is going to deal with a true renaissance a thousand times the
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:41.980]  magnitude of the one with the Gutenberg Bible five hundred and sixty years ago
[3:10:41.980 --> 3:10:47.340]  let me put it this way you and I have had lawsuits I've had them since I left
[3:10:47.340 --> 3:10:53.220]  medical school in 1968 so in every business I was in real estate books
[3:10:53.220 --> 3:10:58.100]  movies they've always been lawyers so one of the signs of success that I
[3:10:58.100 --> 3:11:02.900]  usually say is when I have my lawyers I'm being quite successful because I have
[3:11:02.900 --> 3:11:08.700]  to fund them the notion of a law or legality is what allows you and me to
[3:11:08.700 --> 3:11:13.660]  really go into a kind of a mutual relationship with the adversary where we
[3:11:13.660 --> 3:11:18.660]  can tone down the rhetoric tone down the emotions and allow the kabuki whether
[3:11:18.660 --> 3:11:23.620]  it's right or wrong the kabuki of so-called justice to play out so I
[3:11:23.620 --> 3:11:27.820]  have been there with you I'm still there with you filing lawsuits against the
[3:11:27.820 --> 3:11:32.460]  minds against water companies against all types of it but I haven't stopped
[3:11:32.460 --> 3:11:37.420]  doing that since I was in my 20s or 30s and that's not including what I did in
[3:11:37.420 --> 3:11:41.940]  operational field because I never used lawyers there but in a way that's the
[3:11:41.940 --> 3:11:47.220]  point of success and it's ironic is to have these lawsuits and continuously
[3:11:47.220 --> 3:11:51.900]  fight back the lawyers love this unfortunately that's the way our system
[3:11:51.900 --> 3:11:56.980]  works but it works when you fall when you push back the system doesn't want to
[3:11:56.980 --> 3:12:01.320]  continue to keep paying and hitting Alex Jones that's the same way I would go
[3:12:01.320 --> 3:12:05.620]  all the time I'd have to hire a lawyer in Hollywood a lawyer in the publishing
[3:12:05.620 --> 3:12:10.060]  industry a lawyer here everywhere I looked I had a lawyer but for the most
[3:12:10.060 --> 3:12:14.740]  part they are you're at the year they are your allies in order to create a
[3:12:14.740 --> 3:12:18.140]  new let us say it's the Republican lawyers that are always the good ones as
[3:12:18.140 --> 3:12:21.100]  the Democrats of the bad ones I mean more more realize that the Republican
[3:12:21.100 --> 3:12:24.340]  establishments bad but the Democrat lawyers of the scum of the earth Carlos
[3:12:24.340 --> 3:12:28.220]  in Canada you're on the other side but you know go ahead thanks for holding you
[3:12:28.220 --> 3:12:33.540]  very much Alexa it's great pleasure to speak to see to both of you most
[3:12:33.540 --> 3:12:38.980]  informative and powerful analysis I wanted to draw your attention to what
[3:12:38.980 --> 3:12:45.420]  is defined as the swamp in my opinion the problem in the United States which
[3:12:45.420 --> 3:12:52.220]  President Trump can solve not easily but he is able to is that the problem of
[3:12:52.220 --> 3:12:57.780]  congressmen and senators who receive money from foreign powers indirectly
[3:12:57.780 --> 3:13:03.180]  through agencies and friends and so on and and are able to without even reading
[3:13:03.180 --> 3:13:08.900]  the legislation sometimes just pass it through and you know even defiance of
[3:13:08.900 --> 3:13:12.500]  exactly the idea that Trump's a foreign power when it's the globalist that have
[3:13:12.500 --> 3:13:16.780]  sold us out is asinine so what do we do how do we identify the swamp he didn't
[3:13:16.780 --> 3:13:20.140]  hire any lobbyists how does Trump go completely ape and start indicting a
[3:13:20.140 --> 3:13:26.900]  bunch of these people well it's a matter of democracy information a matter of
[3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:30.980]  informing the public as to who's taking money from where some of these people are
[3:13:30.980 --> 3:13:35.300]  room temperature IQ I mean it's well they're so dumb the US had half the
[3:13:35.300 --> 3:13:40.140]  world industrial power 30 40 years ago they sold it out to corporations for
[3:13:40.140 --> 3:13:43.540]  little nickel and dime power when we could have projected freedom worldwide
[3:13:43.540 --> 3:13:48.020]  built everybody up and been in charge of it all they literally gave away the
[3:13:48.020 --> 3:13:52.620]  perfect free market system of world government they the globalist are the
[3:13:52.620 --> 3:13:57.260]  biggest idiots on the planet yes and this it turns out you you've got a
[3:13:57.260 --> 3:14:02.420]  situation where a foreign leader of could be Saudi Arabia or Israel can go to
[3:14:02.420 --> 3:14:06.460]  the to the Senate to the Congress get standing ovations you know to the
[3:14:06.460 --> 3:14:10.380]  embarrassment of the president to the embarrassment of the community they're
[3:14:10.380 --> 3:14:15.460]  supposed to serve and turn around and ignoring things like the Simington
[3:14:15.460 --> 3:14:20.580]  amendment which prohibits countries from giving money absolutely what about
[3:14:20.580 --> 3:14:24.100]  Boomerang around like Trump you let the Submariner off the show to 50-year-old
[3:14:24.100 --> 3:14:27.700]  submarine it was no big deal it was all bull they found the landfill clearly a
[3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:31.820]  setup he pardon that guy cuz you saw how Hillary would it did a thousand ten
[3:14:31.820 --> 3:14:36.620]  thousand times that what about Boomerang in back I mean why won't why won't the
[3:14:36.620 --> 3:14:41.140]  Justice Department Dr. Pritchett go after all the clear sellouts to foreign
[3:14:41.140 --> 3:14:45.540]  powers that Hillary got caught in why why why like you said why does he fire
[3:14:45.540 --> 3:14:51.260]  Rosenstein and these people I don't know why he doesn't fire them I can tell you
[3:14:51.260 --> 3:14:55.140]  I wouldn't trust them because most of them are bureaucrats who have really no
[3:14:55.140 --> 3:14:59.980]  vested interest in serving our country what they basically do along with the
[3:14:59.980 --> 3:15:04.980]  politician is they're concerned about their own viability or their own lively
[3:15:04.980 --> 3:15:09.740]  but if you look at a congressman don't they get if they bet on a country like
[3:15:09.740 --> 3:15:13.660]  this with the resources of the culture they get everything by betting on the
[3:15:13.660 --> 3:15:17.860]  country instead of worrying about their own stupid asses they're not then I'm
[3:15:17.860 --> 3:15:22.940]  looking at the United States they're looking at their own specific amount of
[3:15:22.940 --> 3:15:26.500]  money that they receive this no I agree they think Trump's mentally ill because
[3:15:26.500 --> 3:15:30.960]  he cares about America it's America it is exceptional idiots it's the
[3:15:30.960 --> 3:15:34.700]  Renaissance we have to bet on it or the chai comms or some other we're gonna do

[3:17:56.140 --> 3:18:01.020]  counsel Robert Mueller in December 2017 after the publication of some fake news
[3:18:01.020 --> 3:18:05.260]  according to a New York Times article published this week Trump told advisors
[3:18:05.260 --> 3:18:09.180]  to fire Mueller following reports the special counsel's office subpoenaed his
[3:18:09.180 --> 3:18:12.940]  bank records the Times reported that Trump believed the subpoenas crossed a
[3:18:12.940 --> 3:18:17.060]  red line he'd set for the Mueller probe the stories about the bank subpoenas
[3:18:17.060 --> 3:18:20.860]  which appeared in the Wall Street Journal Reuters and Bloomberg turned out to be
[3:18:20.860 --> 3:18:24.460]  inaccurate and the outlets issued a correction noting the subpoenas were for
[3:18:24.460 --> 3:18:28.780]  bank records of Trump associates this week the president tweeted if I wanted
[3:18:28.780 --> 3:18:32.820]  to fire Robert Mueller in December as reported by the failing New York Times
[3:18:32.820 --> 3:18:37.580]  I would have fired him just more fake news from a biased newspaper and this
[3:18:37.580 --> 3:18:40.940]  isn't the first time that the New York Times has reported that the president
[3:18:40.940 --> 3:18:44.460]  considered firing Mueller the Times reported that the president demanded
[3:18:44.460 --> 3:18:49.420]  White House counsel Don McGahn fire Mueller in June 2017 but Trump backed
[3:18:49.420 --> 3:18:55.580]  down after McGahn threatened to resign Leanne McAdoo info wars.com Alex Jones

[3:20:15.260 --> 3:20:20.060]  then they've got a great guest house coming up Joel Gilbert with a big gas
[3:20:20.060 --> 3:20:24.180]  and a key breaking Intel always has amazing guests on and Joel lets me pop
[3:20:24.180 --> 3:20:27.740]  up in here on these Friday editions I need to go over I appreciate him he's
[3:20:27.740 --> 3:20:31.300]  welcome to come back later during the 34-hour broadcast on the war room as well
[3:20:31.300 --> 3:20:38.300]  filmmaker Joel Gilbert but when I am openly saying that humanity needs a
[3:20:38.300 --> 3:20:42.660]  world government that doesn't have governmental power it needs a system
[3:20:42.660 --> 3:20:46.620]  where people come together they discuss they make unilateral deals country to
[3:20:46.620 --> 3:20:50.900]  country that's the next step in humanity but not some secret authoritarian
[3:20:50.900 --> 3:20:54.580]  thing where corporations that are greedy run it or you get rid of sovereignty I
[3:20:54.580 --> 3:21:00.540]  see it as America 1776 worldwide is what I call it and true free market in true
[3:21:00.540 --> 3:21:04.660]  open societies countering George Soros's open society that's a counterfeit the
[3:21:04.660 --> 3:21:09.420]  fraud of that shot you made that point that America with all its wealth all its
[3:21:09.420 --> 3:21:12.780]  power because it was the most free country in the world had the whole
[3:21:12.780 --> 3:21:16.660]  future ahead of it but the robber barons leverages out the you know the
[3:21:16.660 --> 3:21:19.500]  smarts of the yeoman farmer and the folks working in factories couldn't
[3:21:19.500 --> 3:21:23.580]  translate into the robber barons and the and the big elites and so we've now
[3:21:23.580 --> 3:21:28.100]  seen the globalist last half century but that thing is coming to an end and
[3:21:28.100 --> 3:21:30.460]  they're panicking you know Dr. Pachennick go to these calls right now but
[3:21:30.460 --> 3:21:34.660]  briefly got called up and said oh Alex the globalists aren't losing we need to
[3:21:34.660 --> 3:21:37.860]  get violent but the guys always call for the violence they're not leading the
[3:21:37.860 --> 3:21:42.380]  violence I really think the prognosis is good for nationalism and free market
[3:21:42.380 --> 3:21:47.100]  after all it works so much better than tyranny and communism and socialism and
[3:21:47.100 --> 3:21:51.140]  authoritarianism really we just promote it and expose it don't you think we'll
[3:21:51.140 --> 3:21:56.740]  win I think we're winning already the fact is look at the economy it's been on
[3:21:56.740 --> 3:22:02.100]  a roar I mean we have really had an incredible growth we've had the lowest
[3:22:02.100 --> 3:22:09.820]  unemployment rate in years we have been able to finish a war in Iraq and
[3:22:09.820 --> 3:22:16.220]  in Syria and pretty much in Afghanistan I mean we are in great shape the real
[3:22:16.220 --> 3:22:21.100]  issue for the globalist is that they do not understand what Americans about
[3:22:21.100 --> 3:22:26.900]  source is a what we call the Udenrat Hungarian Jew who really is not relevant
[3:22:26.900 --> 3:22:32.100]  to us he was a traitor to other people I mean when you are basically
[3:22:32.100 --> 3:22:37.460]  compromised in your character the rest of your life you're compromised I mean
[3:22:37.460 --> 3:22:42.580]  again then as a psychiatrist studying his activities what is his problem his
[3:22:42.580 --> 3:22:46.900]  problem is I could give you your guys would you know I could give you a
[3:22:46.900 --> 3:22:52.540]  psychiatric diagnosis but he's pretty much of the a-hole I mean that's that's
[3:22:52.540 --> 3:22:57.580]  what I would say is his diagnosis he's a raving a-hole I know I've met him I
[3:22:57.580 --> 3:23:03.300]  find him totally ignorant and totally unpleasant but it's not he's not the
[3:23:03.300 --> 3:23:07.540]  relevance part what's relevant is for you to maintain and for us to maintain
[3:23:07.540 --> 3:23:12.020]  where the country is going at a very fast rate we're starting to get
[3:23:12.020 --> 3:23:16.700]  millennials into the political system who watch you who listen to you whether
[3:23:16.700 --> 3:23:19.620]  they're the left or the right they're coming in and they're beginning to
[3:23:19.620 --> 3:23:23.180]  understand number one you serve the country however you want to serve it
[3:23:23.180 --> 3:23:27.420]  number two you then come back and serve it in a civilian form number three you
[3:23:27.420 --> 3:23:33.140]  get involved in local politics as lbj it's always local they are sorrows is in
[3:23:33.140 --> 3:23:37.820]  the Pelosi's and the fine-steen they're their fossils they're there no I agree
[3:23:37.820 --> 3:23:41.340]  they're huge exhibition of energy is their death row that is the truth statement
[3:23:41.340 --> 3:23:46.220]  today David David in Oklahoma you're on the air go ahead thanks for holding
[3:23:46.220 --> 3:23:51.100]  my guess sir I I want you to know that you have a great following in that
[3:23:51.100 --> 3:23:54.980]  within the 18-wheeler community and we really appreciate the information that
[3:23:54.980 --> 3:24:02.380]  we get and I I have a fan of the brain force the alfamil I've used many of
[3:24:02.380 --> 3:24:06.660]  your products and you know it took a few weeks for it to cut to where I could
[3:24:06.660 --> 3:24:11.860]  tell but my doctor told me I needed vitamin D I use your bone and joint I
[3:24:11.860 --> 3:24:16.380]  use your winter sun and what a big difference you know it's funny you say
[3:24:16.380 --> 3:24:19.020]  that we don't just give people stimulants we give them what the top
[3:24:19.020 --> 3:24:22.540]  side is not me say is the building blocks you're missing so it takes a few
[3:24:22.540 --> 3:24:26.580]  weeks exactly this is not instant you know paper over stuff this is this takes
[3:24:26.580 --> 3:24:31.780]  a few weeks like x2 you name it but once it kicks in yeah and once it kicks in
[3:24:31.780 --> 3:24:35.620]  and then you know there's times when I have to drive all night I take to brain
[3:24:35.620 --> 3:24:40.740]  force it doesn't matter if I even drink coffee I don't even need coffee and it's
[3:24:40.740 --> 3:24:45.700]  clear I can concentrate on my driving and you know I just want you to know
[3:24:45.700 --> 3:24:51.940]  that I have I've contributed I'm probably coming upon a thousand dollars
[3:24:51.940 --> 3:24:56.020]  right now that of products and I thought I've got over 2,500 points of
[3:24:56.020 --> 3:25:00.460]  hatred points right now and I'm going to order some more stuff today well let me
[3:25:00.460 --> 3:25:06.100]  say this David if you weren't here we'd be shut down I mean you I don't just tell
[3:25:06.100 --> 3:25:09.500]  the audience is to patronize if you weren't supporting we wouldn't have
[3:25:09.500 --> 3:25:13.620]  Trump in we wouldn't have this platform it'd be all over so thank you so much
[3:25:13.620 --> 3:25:19.180]  for your support sir yes sir we'd like to be and I appreciate I fly info wars
[3:25:19.180 --> 3:25:22.500]  your bumper stickers I get bumper stickers when I order stuff I put it on
[3:25:22.500 --> 3:25:27.540]  my window on the inside so it can't be removed and and I say what I have
[3:25:27.540 --> 3:25:32.140]  conversations I wear your t-shirts and I wore one of you know the big well
[3:25:32.140 --> 3:25:36.580]  Hillary for prison to have Joel Searle's on fire on the back of it and you know
[3:25:36.580 --> 3:25:40.780]  I'm waiting there to take paper stuff and these drivers come up to start
[3:25:40.780 --> 3:25:44.620]  talking about George Searle's I mean we know and I mean you there's so many
[3:25:44.620 --> 3:25:49.540]  drivers that that you know follow you yeah what is it not a pochinic about
[3:25:49.540 --> 3:25:53.820]  truck drivers they seem to be not left or right but just super informed patriots
[3:25:53.820 --> 3:25:58.260]  I'm not just saying that truck drivers out of any group I've invested in a lot
[3:25:58.260 --> 3:26:02.380]  of truck right number one believe it or not the truck drivers are very
[3:26:02.380 --> 3:26:06.540]  independent what they really do is they own their own trucks and what they
[3:26:06.540 --> 3:26:12.100]  depend on is a very sophisticated information system that tells them where
[3:26:12.100 --> 3:26:16.620]  to pick up the load how much the load is where to take the load so they are
[3:26:16.620 --> 3:26:21.900]  very sophisticated business people who know exactly what they need what they
[3:26:21.900 --> 3:26:26.500]  want to do and what it takes so this is an example this gentleman is a great
[3:26:26.500 --> 3:26:32.220]  example of why America is great trucks are moving everywhere over the way I knew
[3:26:32.220 --> 3:26:35.740]  what you're gonna say is number like five years ago you said the truck driver
[3:26:35.740 --> 3:26:40.380]  is the archetype of America I remember you saying that that's correct and I
[3:26:40.380 --> 3:26:44.260]  believe it they have become the archetype of America because that's their
[3:26:44.260 --> 3:26:48.860]  independent freedom they take they drive when they wanted they pick up the loads
[3:26:48.860 --> 3:26:53.020]  they wanted they know where to go when they go over to another place a thousand
[3:26:53.020 --> 3:26:56.820]  miles away they have another load they bring it back they know what the
[3:26:56.820 --> 3:27:01.260]  shipment is they know how much it costs you can't get more sophisticated than a
[3:27:01.260 --> 3:27:04.180]  truck almost like a land-based merchant marine it's an army
[3:27:04.180 --> 3:27:09.020]  you got it exactly right and they have to deal with sophisticated internet
[3:27:09.020 --> 3:27:13.460]  capacities now do you think our politicians know anything about it not
[3:27:13.460 --> 3:27:18.060]  basically the truckers are the most amazing business people I've ever met
[3:27:18.060 --> 3:27:21.220]  and by the way they're the most courteous on the road and they're
[3:27:21.220 --> 3:27:25.700]  formidable the other ones who make the road go I was just asking why I've been
[3:27:25.700 --> 3:27:29.380]  on the air 23 years it's the truckers of any group we should make the show more
[3:27:29.380 --> 3:27:33.940]  about truckers that's they are the most the most active patriotic group it's
[3:27:33.940 --> 3:27:37.900]  crazy other than veterans well because they are like you and I they're
[3:27:37.900 --> 3:27:42.020]  business people if you haven't you know everybody says you got to go to college
[3:27:42.020 --> 3:27:44.980]  now you don't have to go to college you have to understand what it is that you
[3:27:44.980 --> 3:27:48.940]  can do and if you're a trucker you go to school you learn how to drive the truck
[3:27:48.940 --> 3:27:53.860]  it's a very sophisticated system but at the same time you take the risk you take
[3:27:53.860 --> 3:27:57.660]  the load you take the upside you take the leverage you know the gas you know
[3:27:57.660 --> 3:28:01.660]  the wear-out you know the depreciation you know the length of time that the
[3:28:01.660 --> 3:28:06.140]  truck can go in and that process that's empowering to the individual it's
[3:28:06.140 --> 3:28:10.780]  totally empowering and it's empowering to our country the more trucks we have the
[3:28:10.780 --> 3:28:15.180]  more trade we have and you can see it east west and north south I mean I live
[3:28:15.180 --> 3:28:18.900]  right in the middle of Florida you see trucking going from Jacksonville to
[3:28:18.900 --> 3:28:23.020]  Gainesville it's constant and if we're building more roads so the
[3:28:23.020 --> 3:28:26.940]  infrastructure project is the next thing Trump is going to talk about who
[3:28:26.940 --> 3:28:31.300]  else has talked about it I haven't heard a president talk about that yet so the
[3:28:31.300 --> 3:28:35.660]  trucker is the penultimate American entrepreneur all right God bless you
[3:28:35.660 --> 3:28:38.500]  David listen I said I wouldn't go any further and Larry claimants kind of with

[3:31:04.180 --> 3:31:09.020]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and
[3:31:09.020 --> 3:31:14.580]  respiratory function. In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that
[3:31:14.580 --> 3:31:18.460]  people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and
[3:31:18.460 --> 3:31:22.540]  inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published
[3:31:22.540 --> 3:31:27.300]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[3:31:27.300 --> 3:31:32.020]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block
[3:31:32.020 --> 3:31:36.940]  is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[3:31:36.940 --> 3:31:40.980]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which
[3:31:40.980 --> 3:31:45.980]  is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go

[3:33:45.540 --> 3:33:52.180]  what he had to do never saw Merle Haggard in concert I was buying tickets to
[3:33:52.180 --> 3:33:58.260]  see him in like Waco in a month when he died in South Texas and it was like
[3:33:58.260 --> 3:34:02.380]  Corpus Christi or something from pneumonia side issue I apologize Joel
[3:34:02.380 --> 3:34:05.280]  Gilbert when he signed on to do Fridays one hour I told him occasionally that
[3:34:05.280 --> 3:34:08.940]  hijacked it but he's welcome to come on Larry claiming during the war room or
[3:34:08.940 --> 3:34:11.940]  during the 34-hour broadcast is going on or in the last segment here in a few
[3:34:11.940 --> 3:34:15.900]  minutes but I swore to go to these phone calls so we're doing it right now
[3:34:15.900 --> 3:34:20.780]  thank you David Oklahoma appreciate your call Nemo in Massachusetts you're on the
[3:34:20.780 --> 3:34:25.780]  year with the co-author of many of Tom Clancy's books Dr. Chief but Dr. Steve
[3:34:25.780 --> 3:34:33.020]  Picchina go ahead okay you got your question now that the other questions
[3:34:33.020 --> 3:34:36.780]  well there you go you had your question about Tom Clancy died mysteriously yeah
[3:34:36.780 --> 3:34:41.740]  go ahead you're on the air thank you Alex a big fan yes well I haven't been
[3:34:41.740 --> 3:34:45.260]  able to get too many direct sources I found out kind of late towards the end
[3:34:45.260 --> 3:34:48.780]  of the election that he died couldn't find any real coverage on it was asking
[3:34:48.780 --> 3:34:52.460]  if the doctor it did get unusually low coverage for one of the best-selling
[3:34:52.460 --> 3:34:56.660]  doctors in US history go ahead absolutely I think the main reason for
[3:34:56.660 --> 3:35:00.860]  that is he's essentially our first accepted leaker you know he's he taught
[3:35:00.860 --> 3:35:04.740]  the American people what really goes on with all those government dollars and
[3:35:04.740 --> 3:35:10.740]  all those programs and truly a great American in my mind but yeah I only found
[3:35:10.740 --> 3:35:15.380]  out through you know following the rabbit hole of all the people who had
[3:35:15.380 --> 3:35:22.180]  died mysteriously and yeah I couldn't find any real solid coverage well one of
[3:35:22.180 --> 3:35:25.700]  those good friends was right here was there any hanky-panky or foul players
[3:35:25.700 --> 3:35:32.260]  called ugly was no Tom was an unusually bright man a very funny man a very
[3:35:32.260 --> 3:35:36.500]  serious man when he had to write we wrote together we did a lot of things
[3:35:36.500 --> 3:35:41.980]  together I can assure you he died a very dignified death a very quiet death I
[3:35:41.980 --> 3:35:46.820]  missed him very much and the irony of all about Tom although he wrote these
[3:35:46.820 --> 3:35:51.340]  brilliant books was that he was one of the funniest men I had ever known and he
[3:35:51.340 --> 3:35:55.780]  would always temper my laughter because I said Tom we really should be in the
[3:35:55.780 --> 3:36:00.620]  business of writing comedy and humor and he said no no no that's much harder than
[3:36:00.620 --> 3:36:05.700]  you realize so now we miss him I can assure you he died a very dignified
[3:36:05.700 --> 3:36:10.300]  and honorable death he's a great service to America and he was a great
[3:36:10.300 --> 3:36:15.820]  American I thank you for the question any other questions demo I would just like
[3:36:15.820 --> 3:36:20.060]  to say thank you to the doctor and that I'll spread that to those of us that are
[3:36:20.060 --> 3:36:25.620]  skeptics and and seekers and please keep continuing continuing to do what you do
[3:36:25.620 --> 3:36:28.540]  sure I don't get in his private life but I mean didn't he smoke a lot of
[3:36:28.540 --> 3:36:34.500]  cigarettes yes I didn't want to get into that but he did smoke a lot of
[3:36:34.500 --> 3:36:40.180]  cigarettes there's a little story I had to kind of a sidebar when we were in
[3:36:40.180 --> 3:36:45.740]  Hollywood together and we were doing the four-hour miniseries I he went around I
[3:36:45.740 --> 3:36:51.340]  had to kind of hide some of the cigarettes a lot of force huh that net
[3:36:51.340 --> 3:36:58.060]  force boy you're you're that's amazing yes that wasn't that force and we kind of
[3:36:58.060 --> 3:37:02.380]  had a game and then he kind picked up a few cigarettes in one place and then
[3:37:02.380 --> 3:37:07.980]  another place and I said well you missed a couple points and then in the car he
[3:37:07.980 --> 3:37:12.540]  just picked up all the cigarettes he had and it's the kind of habit you really
[3:37:12.540 --> 3:37:17.260]  can't break but he was a wonderful partner I really enjoyed having him and
[3:37:17.260 --> 3:37:21.740]  he had a great sense of humor a great American he really loved this country
[3:37:21.740 --> 3:37:27.420]  and when we worked together it was just a great pleasure but unfortunately he
[3:37:27.420 --> 3:37:31.580]  smoked a lot and I only started smoking in college when I would drink beer and
[3:37:31.580 --> 3:37:34.220]  stuff and I didn't like it at first and then all of a sudden I caught myself
[3:37:34.220 --> 3:37:39.140]  about eight years ago smoking a pack a day and I went in my like three-year-old
[3:37:39.140 --> 3:37:43.860]  daughter grabbed the cigarettes and threw the trash that was it but yeah if we
[3:37:43.860 --> 3:37:48.380]  can do any one thing we have to warn our audience please stop smoking it really
[3:37:48.380 --> 3:37:52.620]  has a very deleterious effect on your body when you come in the emergency room
[3:37:52.620 --> 3:37:56.780]  we doctors know automatically if you even tell us that you didn't smoke we'll
[3:37:56.780 --> 3:38:02.220]  know that and it has a deleterious effect they put ammonia into the nicotine so
[3:38:02.220 --> 3:38:05.660]  it's addictive it's not just like a bunch of chemicals they get away with a
[3:38:05.660 --> 3:38:09.300]  grandfather that's a great point that's correct I put all sorts of crap in there
[3:38:09.300 --> 3:38:14.380]  Nemo thank you Jeff in Canada you're on there with Dr. Steve Pachennick go ahead
[3:38:15.420 --> 3:38:22.700]  hey Alex are you there yes sir hey I just I'm driving a truck up and down
[3:38:22.700 --> 3:38:27.460]  Vancouver Island today and and you sharing that segment earlier in the day
[3:38:27.460 --> 3:38:35.060]  about people getting chopped up and and shot and you broke my heart man I I'd
[3:38:35.060 --> 3:38:39.020]  stop the truck and cry well you want to have to watch the footage you know I got
[3:38:39.020 --> 3:38:43.340]  tears in my eyes and I made myself watch two hours of it in that office of al-Qaeda
[3:38:43.340 --> 3:38:46.180]  and ISIS chopping up people and making people eat it before they blew their
[3:38:46.180 --> 3:38:49.460]  heads off a lot of little kids off and laughing when they shot little girls in
[3:38:49.460 --> 3:38:52.460]  the head that's the kind of footage has been removed off YouTube most people
[3:38:52.460 --> 3:38:55.620]  have a scene and that's the satanic behavior of the jihadis I don't know
[3:38:55.620 --> 3:38:58.820]  how they get those people so whacked out but I mean it's it's like watching
[3:38:58.820 --> 3:39:04.020]  Charlie Manson Manson cut up you know you're the lady he killed but it's it's
[3:39:04.020 --> 3:39:10.620]  it's actually happening you know I guess I just I just thank God for info wars
[3:39:10.620 --> 3:39:15.660]  and all the wonderful guests that you have on to be able to just bring that
[3:39:15.660 --> 3:39:20.580]  information that will never hear from from MSM and I just want to say you know
[3:39:20.580 --> 3:39:24.260]  I heard about this other the truck driver and and the support I just want to
[3:39:24.260 --> 3:39:29.780]  say from Canada I want to I want to just pledge to you today a hundred bucks and
[3:39:29.780 --> 3:39:34.700]  I want to just anybody with an earshot of wanting to be free because this is
[3:39:34.700 --> 3:39:39.460]  there's a there's an international movement against us freedom loving God
[3:39:39.460 --> 3:39:45.220]  loving people if you can hear this support Alex support the show support the
[3:39:45.220 --> 3:39:50.180]  guests because maybe you don't think you can afford a hundred bucks but if you
[3:39:50.180 --> 3:39:56.140]  can't afford to do that can you can you afford to be without outlets like yours
[3:39:56.140 --> 3:39:59.740]  well I know this I know this I have so much faith in people that I'm super
[3:39:59.740 --> 3:40:04.900]  confident but absolutely I mean we have the globalist after us we have the worst
[3:40:04.900 --> 3:40:08.060]  people after us and when you support us financially and get great products at
[3:40:08.060 --> 3:40:11.820]  the same time it's seismic that's why they hate free market because free market
[3:40:11.820 --> 3:40:16.260]  even if it's limited gives people a manifestation of their will that if you
[3:40:16.260 --> 3:40:19.820]  read the Clinton Foundation documents not the current one but their their their
[3:40:19.820 --> 3:40:25.260]  law library in like 1993 the documents came out that were you know from their
[3:40:25.260 --> 3:40:28.380]  first one for president they were obsessed with not letting libertarians
[3:40:28.380 --> 3:40:33.900]  or nationalists or conservatives have a market have books they wanted books shut
[3:40:33.900 --> 3:40:37.940]  down they wanted video shut down they wanted no economy for us well they
[3:40:37.940 --> 3:40:43.700]  failed didn't they dr. Pachennick they failed completely ironically the man
[3:40:43.700 --> 3:40:49.460]  behind a lot of what happened in Arkansas was a man and a man by the name
[3:40:49.460 --> 3:40:54.380]  of Sam Walton if you look back at his history he was in military intelligence
[3:40:54.380 --> 3:40:59.460]  he was in fact in charge of the internment camps for the German Americans
[3:40:59.460 --> 3:41:04.820]  and the Italian Americans and so what you had was an individual who already
[3:41:04.820 --> 3:41:10.060]  understood repression and suppression as a result of that he garnered a lot of
[3:41:10.060 --> 3:41:14.780]  money I would say from China or elsewhere and then propagated this notion
[3:41:14.780 --> 3:41:21.020]  through the Clintons and others but it's a very dangerous collusion that
[3:41:21.020 --> 3:41:27.060]  occurred between World War two intelligence reports and people and the
[3:41:27.060 --> 3:41:33.460]  ongoing representatives of the state and if you see the movie by Tom Cruise
[3:41:33.460 --> 3:41:38.220]  American made you don't understand how the intelligence world of the deep
[3:41:38.220 --> 3:41:42.580]  state world under the Clintons work against the interests of the United
[3:41:42.580 --> 3:41:47.300]  States I strongly recommend that movie I think it's an Amazon because it's very
[3:41:47.300 --> 3:41:51.500]  it's hot I'm on a big cruise fan but it's an excellent movie I saw it very
[3:41:51.500 --> 3:41:55.180]  historical as you said God bless you Jeff thank you look I'm out of time I've

[3:43:16.020 --> 3:43:21.060]  the response from FBI assistant director Gregory Brower reads all FBI

[3:43:25.620 --> 3:43:29.260]  appearance senator Paul warned that this potentially means that the exposed
[3:43:29.260 --> 3:43:33.900]  officials who called Trump an idiot and a loathsome human and talked about an
[3:43:33.900 --> 3:43:38.900]  FBI secret society and an insurance policy for if Trump was elected can
[3:43:38.900 --> 3:43:43.100]  still access information regarding the investigation posing a potential threat
[3:43:43.100 --> 3:43:47.300]  to national security Paul said Peter Struck and Lisa Page were exposed as

[3:47:58.220 --> 3:48:02.980]  it's trump the art of the insult now I'm gonna spend this segment talking about
[3:48:02.980 --> 3:48:09.700]  how important it was that Paul Ryan is leaving the house I call it good riddance
[3:48:09.700 --> 3:48:15.940]  to Paul Ryan Paul Ryan is old-school establishment he was the Republican
[3:48:15.940 --> 3:48:21.100]  leader in the house during Obama's presidency and he didn't said almost
[3:48:21.100 --> 3:48:27.580]  nothing to stop Barack Obama's radical agenda does anyone remember Paul Ryan
[3:48:27.580 --> 3:48:32.260]  leading the fight against Obama's open borders does anyone remember Paul Ryan
[3:48:32.260 --> 3:48:36.420]  saying anything about the IRS targeting of conservatives and the
[3:48:36.420 --> 3:48:41.980]  interference in the 2012 election the only reason we had DOJ and FBI
[3:48:41.980 --> 3:48:48.220]  interference in 2016 is because the IRS interfered in 2012 Paul Ryan and the
[3:48:48.220 --> 3:48:55.140]  Republicans did nothing Paul Ryan was and is not a fighter the Republican base
[3:48:55.140 --> 3:49:00.620]  voters want fighters so Paul Ryan was never a good fit for speaker of the
[3:49:00.620 --> 3:49:06.740]  house where he got very little done I want to play a video of Paul Ryan telling
[3:49:06.740 --> 3:49:11.500]  us why he's quitting the house let's play that video that's why today I'm
[3:49:11.500 --> 3:49:15.100]  announcing that this year will be my last one as a member of the house what I
[3:49:15.100 --> 3:49:22.180]  realize is if I am here for one more term my kids will only have ever known me
[3:49:22.180 --> 3:49:30.180]  as a weekend dad I just can't let that happen okay so let's tell the truth here
[3:49:30.180 --> 3:49:34.860]  Paul Ryan did not resign because he wants to spend time with his teenage
[3:49:34.860 --> 3:49:40.420]  kids teenage kids are busy they don't hang out with dad anyway and it's not
[3:49:40.420 --> 3:49:45.740]  true that he's only been a weekend father Congress is only scheduled to be in
[3:49:45.740 --> 3:49:54.060]  session about 130 days every year so there's about 225 days with long
[3:49:54.060 --> 3:50:01.980]  vacations winter summer spring fall so this is just a ridiculous excuse believe
[3:50:01.980 --> 3:50:05.940]  me Paul Ryan's kids are very disappointed that their dad is resigning
[3:50:05.940 --> 3:50:10.860]  they wish he would go back to Washington they come to Washington they have a great
[3:50:10.860 --> 3:50:16.020]  time and these are the most famous kids in Wisconsin because their dad is the
[3:50:16.020 --> 3:50:23.020]  speaker 120 days out of the 365 day year so family time is always a generic
[3:50:23.020 --> 3:50:30.180]  excuse family time for anyone who quits with a very big issue so before I tell
[3:50:30.180 --> 3:50:35.820]  you the truth about why Paul Ryan is quitting let's go back a bit who is Paul
[3:50:35.820 --> 3:50:40.780]  Ryan well the first thing people think of when they see Paul Ryan they think well
[3:50:40.780 --> 3:50:47.260]  there's Herman Munster all grown up Herman Munster grew up and he ran for
[3:50:47.260 --> 3:50:53.540]  Congress that's the first thing they think of now Paul Ryan did nothing in his
[3:50:53.540 --> 3:50:59.940]  life before running for Congress he came to Congress at age 28 before that he
[3:50:59.940 --> 3:51:04.140]  was an intern Paul Ryan was just a congressional intern and then a
[3:51:04.140 --> 3:51:09.700]  legislative aide so Paul Ryan was a child and is a child of the Washington
[3:51:09.700 --> 3:51:17.460]  swamp and his alleged love and interest for tax and government reform was not
[3:51:17.460 --> 3:51:21.060]  original at all it couldn't be because he had no experience in the private
[3:51:21.060 --> 3:51:27.380]  sector Paul Ryan was a legislative aide for Jack Kemp that's where he even got
[3:51:27.380 --> 3:51:32.780]  the idea of government reform it was not even original and again Paul Ryan
[3:51:32.780 --> 3:51:40.340]  didn't do anything in his life before becoming a congressman at age 28 so you
[3:51:40.340 --> 3:51:46.820]  had Paul Ryan unoriginal inexperienced never accomplished anything and that's
[3:51:46.820 --> 3:51:52.900]  why Mitt Romney chose him for vice president Mitt Romney establishment guy
[3:51:52.900 --> 3:51:59.420]  chooses a Washington swamp guy and that's why they lost that's why they lost
[3:51:59.420 --> 3:52:06.100]  to Barack Obama who was very beatable most unsuccessful pro-russian first term
[3:52:06.100 --> 3:52:14.100]  in history of Barack Obama killed the economy started race race wars you know
[3:52:14.100 --> 3:52:20.740]  abuse of power fast and furious and they got two swamp creatures so look the
[3:52:20.740 --> 3:52:24.380]  only thing that Paul Ryan accomplished in Congress that he said was the goal of
[3:52:24.380 --> 3:52:27.980]  his entire life that he couldn't accomplish for 20 years was tax reform
[3:52:27.980 --> 3:52:32.940]  and the only way he did it was because of Donald Trump this is the guy that Paul
[3:52:32.940 --> 3:52:36.940]  Ryan did not even support for president for 20 years Paul Ryan does nothing and
[3:52:36.940 --> 3:52:42.780]  then Trump comes in and gets it done let's remind ourselves of what Paul Ryan
[3:52:42.780 --> 3:52:47.460]  felt about Trump's agenda let's look at that video
[3:52:49.940 --> 3:52:57.340]  quote Islam hates us did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims I mean a lot of them I
[3:52:57.340 --> 3:53:03.740]  mean a lot of normally I do not comment on what's going on in the presidential
[3:53:03.740 --> 3:53:08.140]  election I will take an exception today some of our best and biggest allies in
[3:53:08.140 --> 3:53:14.100]  this struggle and fight against radical Islamic terror are Muslims the vast
[3:53:14.100 --> 3:53:19.540]  vast vast vast majority of whom are peaceful who believe in pluralism
[3:53:19.540 --> 3:53:25.740]  freedom democracy Donald Trump's plan to deport 11 million illegal immigrants
[3:53:25.740 --> 3:53:30.540]  could never pass Congress according to the new Republican Speaker of the House
[3:53:30.540 --> 3:53:34.140]  I think you can oppose the president on some issue that you fundamentally disagree
[3:53:34.140 --> 3:53:40.140]  with but also work with the other party on issues you do agree with so why is
[3:53:40.140 --> 3:53:45.660]  Ryan quitting Congress all Ryan is going away because he can't stand Trump
[3:53:45.660 --> 3:53:51.220]  winning he can't take the winning it's too much winning he can't stand it that
[3:53:51.220 --> 3:53:55.460]  he accomplished nothing and Trump came in and won I want to show you a video
[3:53:55.460 --> 3:54:00.820]  excerpt from the art of the insults about what Trump said he would do in
[3:54:00.820 --> 3:54:27.060]  office and how he was gonna win let's see that clip
[3:54:30.820 --> 3:54:46.660]  okay so that's that's my take is for 20 years Paul Ryan could not get anything
[3:54:46.660 --> 3:54:51.180]  done on tax reform here comes an outsider and he gets tax reform done
[3:54:51.180 --> 3:54:55.820]  Paul Ryan cannot take the winning he doesn't like the winning it makes him
[3:54:55.820 --> 3:55:01.860]  feel bad Paul Ryan is not a winner he's afraid that Trump will win even more and
[3:55:01.860 --> 3:55:09.180]  make him look even worse Paul Ryan as Trump would say Paul Ryan wants to go
[3:55:09.180 --> 3:55:14.860]  home to Wisconsin and go to sleep I think Paul Ryan needs to step down now not in
[3:55:14.860 --> 3:55:19.820]  January and allow a strong conservative like Jim Jordan to lead the
[3:55:19.820 --> 3:55:25.100]  Republicans into the midterms so I'm gonna say good riddance to Paul Ryan he
[3:55:25.100 --> 3:55:31.020]  represents everything we never needed in a leader he's not a fighter all he did
[3:55:31.020 --> 3:55:35.780]  wanted to do was placate the establishment because he is and always
[3:55:35.780 --> 3:55:40.780]  will be an establishment swamp creature since he was 28 years old that's my take
[3:55:40.780 --> 3:55:48.060]  on Paul Ryan now the FBI and DOJ just released the McCabe report we're gonna
[3:55:48.060 --> 3:55:53.300]  be speaking for a full hour with attorney Larry Klayman coming up at 6
[3:55:53.300 --> 3:55:58.900]  o'clock Eastern we're also gonna look at all the DOJ corruption the the rate on
[3:55:58.900 --> 3:56:05.220]  attorney Michael Cohen a lot of people are saying that that rate on Michael
[3:56:05.220 --> 3:56:09.860]  Cohen's office Donald Trump's attorney was essentially opposition research
[3:56:09.860 --> 3:56:14.460]  they're gonna grab everything they can and start leaking it to the press and
[3:56:14.460 --> 3:56:18.900]  they'll use all of that information to build up to the midterms they'll leak it
[3:56:18.900 --> 3:56:24.300]  out slowly Trump paid off this person his lawyer paid off that person already
[3:56:24.300 --> 3:56:29.140]  Elliott Broidy Broidy the finance chairman of the Republican National
[3:56:29.140 --> 3:56:36.500]  Committee Elliott Broidy big Trump supporter what a coincidence 2448 hours
[3:56:36.500 --> 3:56:42.140]  after the raid on Michael Cohen's offices we find out that Michael Cohen
[3:56:42.140 --> 3:56:46.780]  represented Elliott Broidy in paying some hush money to a playboy
[3:56:46.780 --> 3:56:51.940]  playmate what a coincidence so I think we're gonna see them leak this
[3:56:51.940 --> 3:56:59.820]  information slowly and use it against Trump and the Republicans the DOJ is out
[3:56:59.820 --> 3:57:05.420]  of control the Robert Mueller persecution is out of control attorney Larry
[3:57:05.420 --> 3:57:09.340]  Klayman can be joining us to go through all these issues and talk about what
[3:57:09.340 --> 3:57:15.460]  Trump can and should do again it's gonna be at 6 o'clock Eastern 3 o'clock
