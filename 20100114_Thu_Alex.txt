[00:00.000 --> 00:14.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.680 --> 00:27.560]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends welcome
[00:27.560 --> 00:33.640]  thank you for joining us as we defend Western civilization the Constitution the Bill of
[00:33.640 --> 00:39.360]  Rights against the international crime syndicate known as the New World Order we're gonna be
[00:39.360 --> 00:45.120]  live here for the next four hours on to this Thursday the 14th day of January 2010 edition
[00:45.120 --> 00:52.840]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is coming up later in the first hour to talk about Bankster Gate and
[00:52.840 --> 00:58.360]  little Timmy Geithner will he be indicted could this be the end of the private Federal Reserve
[00:58.360 --> 01:05.320]  Banking Cartel it will be the end of it if we make it the top story look it's a tragedy at
[01:05.320 --> 01:11.680]  least a hundred thousand or more dead in Haiti we suggest people give to smaller aid groups
[01:11.680 --> 01:15.920]  that were already in the country not the big monster aid groups who are always caught stealing
[01:15.920 --> 01:22.000]  the majority of the money we'll be covering day two of the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.760]  today coming up but before we do that we're gonna talk to Judge Andrew Napolitano and then in the
[01:30.760 --> 01:36.920]  next hour we're gonna talk to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts about the latest information with Banker
[01:36.920 --> 01:43.720]  Gate and then I'm going to spend much of the second hour all the third and the fourth hour
[01:43.720 --> 01:51.000]  going over giant stacks of unbelievably vitally important news and I've thought about it long
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.320]  and hard and I don't know what part of the show tends to be the most informative the most power
[01:55.320 --> 02:01.520]  packed it varies every day I tend to go on a long monologue cover a lot of news and rant in the
[02:01.520 --> 02:07.040]  first hour then have guests and calls in the rest of show mixing a lot of important news in but
[02:07.040 --> 02:14.480]  today you definitely don't want to miss the third and fourth hour because the magnitude of the
[02:14.480 --> 02:21.720]  multifaceted news that I have all of it is just so incredibly important and I want to try to save
[02:21.720 --> 02:30.160]  my energy my intellectual repertoire for the third and fourth hour because I need to really
[02:30.160 --> 02:37.920]  focus on this I I tend to get target fatigue now there's so many huge stories so many incredible
[02:37.920 --> 02:43.280]  things going on so much fully exposing and debunking this criminal government that I tend
[02:43.280 --> 02:50.880]  to just descend into into just only covering the surface of a lot of this instead of really
[02:50.880 --> 02:58.280]  fleshing it out what am I talking about well naked body scanners are going in at courthouses all
[02:58.280 --> 03:02.080]  over the country I wasn't even aware of this has been happening for a year and a half that's one
[03:02.080 --> 03:08.360]  small area police all over the country are arresting people on the street that videotaped them even
[03:08.360 --> 03:14.480]  from 50 to 100 yards away when they're beating people or abusing people and the media is saying
[03:14.480 --> 03:20.280]  this is good big brother is going to videotape you everywhere and body scan you but you're not
[03:20.280 --> 03:25.200]  going to videotape cops from your car if you see them beating somebody on the side of the road
[03:25.200 --> 03:32.040]  they're going to come arrest you for wiretapping when clearly they don't have any reasonable
[03:32.040 --> 03:38.360]  expectation of privacy that's their excuse to always videotape us and the fact is they know
[03:38.360 --> 03:42.400]  it's criminal they know it's unconstitutional they know it's a violation of your first amendment
[03:42.400 --> 03:51.520]  of your rights and it's just outrageous but that is microscopic compared to the top news story
[03:51.520 --> 03:57.400]  today and I'm not going to really cover this in the first and second hour I'm going to spend at
[03:57.400 --> 04:08.640]  least 30 minutes on what Cointel pro is because this is one of the subjects that I mentioned and
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.640]  I talk about a bit but I never detail properly and we have so much evidence of it openly being
[04:14.640 --> 04:20.240]  admitted by the Pentagon the FBI the Democratic Party the Republican Party private corporations
[04:20.240 --> 04:33.440]  and we have the White House we have the individual lined up to be the new czar of communications
[04:33.440 --> 04:40.360]  and information regulatory affairs over the media the internet you name it calling for crimes
[04:40.360 --> 04:50.640]  and I can't he published this he isn't even ashamed of it and we already know they're doing this to
[04:50.640 --> 04:56.280]  to info wars namely we're the number one target but this guy's got to get in trouble for this look

[07:14.720 --> 07:19.240]  care for those unable to care for themselves we would intend not to be standing in the
[07:19.240 --> 07:24.240]  breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue
[07:24.240 --> 07:30.600]  if the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence the breadline may have no bread just

[07:35.720 --> 07:41.280]  supply of food will not feed us only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent

[07:55.320 --> 08:08.520]  cares from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[08:08.520 --> 08:17.880]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network out of the gates ladies and gentlemen judge
[08:17.880 --> 08:24.560]  napolitano is our guest andrew napolitano who really doesn't need any introduction here but
[08:24.560 --> 08:29.280]  I'll go ahead and give it he's the honorable andrew p napolitano of course fox news contributor
[08:29.280 --> 08:35.480]  fox news host and I believe the best person on that popular channel I believe he's the only real
[08:35.480 --> 08:42.320]  bonafide libertarian constitutionalist conservative because I've never seen him engage in bait and
[08:42.320 --> 08:47.240]  switches or betrayals of ron paul or anybody else I would love to get behind some of the other
[08:47.240 --> 08:52.040]  guys I'm not going to attack them I just want them to try to be more like judge napolitano and
[08:52.040 --> 09:00.040]  that's why I'm at it alex and I mean people know your biosoul won't get into it freedom watch on
[09:00.040 --> 09:06.560]  the fox as well so much is going on I want to move quick here with you today last week you
[09:06.560 --> 09:14.920]  openly said that he could be indicted for this it surprised me even some of the msnbc host like
[09:14.920 --> 09:21.160]  mr. Schultz said that the white house is in deep trouble congress is subpoenaing aig now we
[09:21.160 --> 09:28.920]  learned that they tucked into a bill as you know that much of this is secret till 2018 which again
[09:28.920 --> 09:33.560]  shows evidence of the attempt to cover up you have geithner and others trying to cover up the fact
[09:33.560 --> 09:40.120]  that they transferred money to themselves and of course the former treasury secretary henry
[09:40.120 --> 09:46.840]  paulson this is huge you know we don't exactly know what geithner himself personally knew but
[09:46.840 --> 09:53.640]  there's a couple of things that we do know and I have read the emails that were released by congressman
[09:53.640 --> 09:58.760]  darrell issa who obtained them in his capacity as an american under the freedom of information
[09:58.760 --> 10:03.320]  act he didn't use any particular government authority to get them and the emails are between
[10:03.320 --> 10:10.280]  and among lawyers for the new york fed lawyers for the treasury department lawyers for aig
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.640]  and lawyers for jp morgan chase which was the intermediary bank that the fed was using through
[10:15.640 --> 10:23.240]  which the funnel its money and basically it is an instruction from the government to aig
[10:23.240 --> 10:30.280]  which was about to receive 185 billion some from the government and some from the federal reserve
[10:30.280 --> 10:35.000]  the largest single bailout in the history of by a government in the history of the world
[10:35.000 --> 10:42.840]  and it was an instruction aig that in its applications for this money it not list truthfully
[10:42.840 --> 10:48.840]  the identity of all of its creditors and it especially not with the its intention to pay
[10:48.840 --> 10:54.040]  some of those creditors a hundred cents of a dollar we now know that the principal creditor
[10:54.040 --> 11:00.040]  that the fed lawyers wanted to keep from public awareness was goldman sacks and of course at
[11:00.040 --> 11:06.040]  the time the treasury secretary henry polson was the recently retired chair of goldman sacks
[11:06.040 --> 11:12.440]  we know now that aig owed goldman sacks 13 billion that a pen planned to pay a hundred
[11:12.440 --> 11:18.760]  cents of the dollar and that in fact it did so question what did tim geithner know and when did
[11:18.760 --> 11:25.640]  he know it well he was the president and ceo of the federal reserve bank of new york at the time
[11:25.640 --> 11:35.000]  his in-house lawyers were telling aig to hide from the sec the existence of the debt to goldman
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.080]  sacks now a little bit of basic law you go to buy a hundred dollar savings bond and you give
[11:41.080 --> 11:47.480]  the wrong zip code no problem but if you intentionally give the wrong address you falsify the federal
[11:47.480 --> 11:54.360]  document and you can be prosecuted can you imagine what the law would say about falsifying a document
[11:54.360 --> 11:59.960]  not for a hundred dollar savings bond but for a hundred eighty five billion dollar bailout of
[11:59.960 --> 12:08.360]  taxpayer dollars that is what is confronting tim geithner now clearly he's the head of the new
[12:08.360 --> 12:12.920]  york fed at the time working with his former boss the former head of goldman sacks who was the
[12:12.920 --> 12:21.800]  treasury secretary in the fall of and and and winner of 2008 henry polson and we have polson
[12:21.800 --> 12:28.280]  we have geithner we have a bernacky all in countless house and senate banking committee
[12:28.280 --> 12:35.080]  meetings repeating what's in the emails saying we won't tell you who got the money we won't tell
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.480]  you telling congress who under the constitution as you know but for some of the audience has full
[12:39.480 --> 12:45.000]  control over the issuance of currency and credit and the banks and so for him to now say oh as the
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.920]  head of the fed i had no idea what was going on with a hundred eighty five billion dollar payout
[12:51.640 --> 12:57.800]  to my own former company and to the current treasury secretary of 2008 i mean this is
[12:57.800 --> 13:04.360]  asinine clearly their policy is to keep this secret and so if we get subpoenas or get those
[13:04.360 --> 13:10.440]  documents we have the sec issuing its own ruling as you know saying it's secret until 2018
[13:10.440 --> 13:15.320]  under the bailout provision they supposedly have this unconstitutional power so we have this giant
[13:15.320 --> 13:21.080]  fraud and criminality going on in plain view but it's kind of like saying can napoleon can hitler
[13:21.080 --> 13:27.640]  can king george the third do wrong or is this the divine right of kings the new kings the private
[13:27.640 --> 13:34.520]  bankers well we we have almost created a a princeton in the white house uh... obviously not starting
[13:34.520 --> 13:40.200]  with barack obama starting with abraham lincoln which president uh... just took on the law themselves
[13:40.200 --> 13:45.720]  and enacted taxes and imposed burdens and made decisions and slaughtered innocence
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.200]  but to their own liking and it's gotten worse and worse since then usually during time of war but
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.600]  and now they just openly steal trillions in front of everyone i mean what's next barbecuing
[13:54.600 --> 13:59.000]  children on the white house lawn well i i i don't know uh... what will be next but
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.480]  this particular president much like his immediate predecessor
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.320]  seems to recognize no natural law
[14:07.320 --> 14:10.920]  american value or constitutional restraint
[14:10.920 --> 14:15.400]  on anything he wants to do now but the time period that we are discussing
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.640]  in which writers lawyers at the fact that told the lawyers for the uh... or at the new york
[14:19.640 --> 14:24.600]  fed told the lawyers for a i g don't tell anybody you're gonna pay thirteen billion to goldman sex
[14:24.600 --> 14:30.520]  the president was george w bush i can't imagine with his lack of intellectual curiosity that he
[14:30.520 --> 14:37.560]  personally knew about this but this happened in his administration so hank paulson is someone
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.240]  that the government can also look at but you put your finger on a very interesting point
[14:41.880 --> 14:47.880]  when the s e c the securities and exchange commission alex says that this is a secret
[14:47.880 --> 14:50.040]  until two thousand and sixteen
[14:50.040 --> 14:56.680]  yes whose regulations were violated by the knowing an intentional decision
[14:56.680 --> 15:03.800]  not to lift a i g as a not to list goldman sex is a creditor of a i g s e c exactly
[15:03.800 --> 15:10.680]  now what when you break the law telling a judge or jury the government told me to do it
[15:10.680 --> 15:17.720]  is not a defense in fact most judges wouldn't even let you articulate that in the courtroom
[15:17.720 --> 15:25.240]  but that is literally what happened here we have the apparent makings of a grand conspiracy
[15:25.240 --> 15:32.200]  conspiracy in which government officials counseled the recipients of government largesse
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.320]  to lie about the nature and extent of the largesse and what was going to be done with it
[15:39.320 --> 15:48.680]  now now judge isn't an oxymoron to to have geithner and and the rest of the crew who are in
[15:48.680 --> 15:52.680]  this revolving door sharing powers with each other in the private corporate banks and then in
[15:52.680 --> 15:59.720]  government clearly stating our official policy is who gets these trillions of dollars that have
[15:59.720 --> 16:06.600]  been served out 180 plus billion of themselves their official policy before congress in the
[16:06.600 --> 16:11.720]  last two years is that it's all secret and then now they say oh my goodness this is terrible
[16:12.680 --> 16:17.880]  we don't know who did this we're not involved in these emails making it secret i mean that
[16:17.880 --> 16:24.040]  right there when they have articulated that their policy is to make it secret and then to now say
[16:24.040 --> 16:30.920]  that that i mean it's it's just insults rational thought clearly they're engaged in a cover up
[16:30.920 --> 16:35.480]  and the sec is clearly involved i mean here's curtain emos info wars dot com headline from
[16:35.480 --> 16:43.160]  yesterday sec engages in conspiracy with aig to hide bailout evidence we've got a top judge here
[16:43.160 --> 16:48.360]  saying that that's exactly what he thinks is going on where do we go from here where they're
[16:48.360 --> 16:54.200]  just i mean the emperor has no clothes this is a joke well we go to places like your show
[16:54.760 --> 17:01.640]  because of your your zeal and your courage and your fearlessness in exposing as much as you
[17:01.640 --> 17:06.840]  exercise the same zeal and courage and fearlessness in the previous administration
[17:06.840 --> 17:13.720]  and we have to educate people but alex i i i feel it resonating now and in what when bush was
[17:13.720 --> 17:19.800]  doing these things i i frequently felt that my words and sometimes yours were falling on deaf
[17:19.800 --> 17:25.640]  ears other than those who before all this happened had an appreciation for human liberty
[17:25.640 --> 17:32.120]  and limited government and the primacy the individual but i see that as a as a prairie fire
[17:32.120 --> 17:37.720]  spreading around the country now i mean just think of it the democrats in massachusetts are
[17:37.720 --> 17:43.240]  within a weekend of losing a seat that they claimed was a was the personal property of the
[17:43.240 --> 17:49.000]  kennedy family to a republican he's not your kind of republican or my kind of there's a mass
[17:49.000 --> 17:54.680]  exodus the the the democratic party is imploding because they're i mean bush we thought bush was
[17:54.680 --> 17:59.720]  bad because he tripled government obama as you know officially spent more money than all presidents
[17:59.720 --> 18:04.680]  before him combined back to george washington and he has only he hasn't even been in a year in an
[18:04.680 --> 18:11.080]  office a year you're right you're right and and i think that the democrats know that they will soon
[18:11.080 --> 18:17.160]  lose their filibuster proof senate and they may actually lose the house altogether in november
[18:17.160 --> 18:24.280]  so they know that if they want to do what fdr did to us in 12 years they only have 10 months left
[18:24.280 --> 18:30.680]  in which to do it on the next 10 months will be a mad dash to see how much unconstitutional
[18:30.680 --> 18:36.360]  legislation that regulates private human behavior they can weave into federal law but they are
[18:36.360 --> 18:43.160]  beginning to feel the blowback already prediction if this young man moderate republican that he is
[18:43.160 --> 18:49.000]  wins and gets ted kennedy seat you will begin to see moderate democrats the so-called blue dog
[18:49.000 --> 18:54.440]  democrats even a couple of them in the senate that voted for the monstrous health care bill
[18:54.440 --> 18:59.560]  begin to defect because they will fear for their own jobs and well they're already starting to jump
[18:59.560 --> 19:06.440]  ship well i don't know who has jumped ship yet from a democrat i'd love to hear it well at the
[19:06.440 --> 19:12.280]  state level we're seeing all sorts of state senators and legislative people we've seen what in the
[19:12.280 --> 19:16.920]  house one democrats say they're shifting over right by the way i learned this morning that the most
[19:16.920 --> 19:22.120]  liberal member of the house of representatives bob wexler from florida resigned and there's no
[19:22.120 --> 19:26.600]  mechanism to replace him in time for the vote on the health care now health care in the house
[19:26.600 --> 19:34.040]  passed by three votes so mrs polosi now has two votes uh with which to with which to play that's
[19:34.040 --> 19:40.760]  the extent of her cushion wow that is huge news and so so to be clear when senator dodd says
[19:40.760 --> 19:45.320]  that it's hanging by a thread and conference committee the government grab of health care
[19:45.320 --> 19:49.880]  it really is hanging by thread oh it absolutely is there's a congressman his name is escaping me
[19:49.880 --> 19:54.600]  a member of the african-american leadership in the house of democrat from missouri was well
[19:54.600 --> 20:00.600]  once the mayor of kansas city who said this morning that uh it it truly is in danger he
[20:00.600 --> 20:05.080]  predicts eventually something will pass but he doesn't think it'll be either the house version
[20:05.080 --> 20:08.920]  of the senate version here's a member of the democratic leadership who predicted they'd go
[20:08.920 --> 20:14.040]  back to square one why because they did it behind the scenes because they didn't care about natural
[20:14.040 --> 20:18.040]  rights they didn't care about the free market they didn't care about american values they didn't
[20:18.040 --> 20:22.440]  care about the constitution and they're trying to shove it down our throats and i think the biggest
[20:22.440 --> 20:27.800]  issue here is liberals finally read the bill and found out wait we're not getting a free launch
[20:27.800 --> 20:35.080]  they raise our taxes and cut our goodies this is a big bailout to insurance companies oh absolutely
[20:35.080 --> 20:41.960]  and and i i am delighted to hear the liberals scream that they and their states will be paying
[20:41.960 --> 20:48.120]  more money because nebresca doesn't have to pay for medicaid and medicare the liberals and some
[20:48.120 --> 20:54.920]  conservatives have done this too have been bribing their own members of congress for generations
[20:55.480 --> 21:00.840]  in order to secure their votes but when they are not the recipient of the bribe but the
[21:00.840 --> 21:06.520]  payer of it oh how you can hear them squeal judge i want to get you up for a full hour
[21:06.520 --> 21:11.320]  in the near future to talk about your latest book all the work you're doing because you
[21:11.320 --> 21:16.920]  really are trailblazing uh at fox news and i see them more and more aligning themselves
[21:17.560 --> 21:23.480]  with you uh and your constitutionalist view but in the six seven minutes we've got left
[21:23.480 --> 21:29.640]  moving quickly uh specifically with your you know constitutional law background a constitutional
[21:29.640 --> 21:39.720]  law lawyer and judge specifically if if you could call the shots right now how do we
[21:39.720 --> 21:45.160]  force bankster gate out into the open i mean it's already blowing up in their face how do we
[21:45.160 --> 21:51.720]  ensure that we mortally wound the private fell reserve banking cartel and and and reveal to the
[21:51.720 --> 21:59.080]  world that this is a unconstitutional larceness enterprise because this this patina this this
[21:59.080 --> 22:06.120]  this cloak of invincibility has now fallen away from them your take on that well there's a couple
[22:06.120 --> 22:12.360]  things going on and and they're both uh um positive in our direction there is litigation
[22:12.360 --> 22:19.720]  making its way through the courts which in my view will grant to bloomberg news and to fox news
[22:19.720 --> 22:24.200]  under the freedom of information act documents that the federal reserve has been fighting
[22:24.200 --> 22:30.200]  aggressively uh to keep secret with respect to tarp now we may not get these documents until
[22:30.200 --> 22:36.280]  after the election of 2010 but once we do get them it'll be a treasure trove there is also a
[22:36.280 --> 22:41.880]  legislation making its way through congress which is congressman ron paul's legislation
[22:41.880 --> 22:47.400]  to audit the fed now unfortunately it has been attached to other legislation which is utterly
[22:47.400 --> 22:53.080]  hateful to those of us who believe in the free market and limited government but by by attaching
[22:53.080 --> 22:58.680]  it to that legislation the president cannot veto it because he desperately wants the other
[22:58.680 --> 23:05.560]  legislation with it it's a sleeper if it becomes law and if there is a true audit of the fed as
[23:05.560 --> 23:12.920]  it does call for it will expose this uh monster from jackall island for all of the horrific
[23:12.920 --> 23:18.760]  things it's done the secret foreign policy that it runs the monsters that it's been bailing out
[23:18.760 --> 23:23.320]  the people that have been making money the inflation the secret tax that it's imposed
[23:23.320 --> 23:28.440]  on all of us we will finally have in front of the american people in black and white
[23:28.440 --> 23:34.600]  but who what when where and how that they did this to us so the momentum is shifting in the
[23:34.600 --> 23:39.800]  direction of liberty everybody can feel it you are seeing and is that what you're saying yeah but
[23:39.800 --> 23:45.320]  you know it's an odd momentum i'll give you an example um uh the the chairman of the house
[23:45.320 --> 23:51.480]  financial services committee the the bombastic and colorful barney frankie quintessential liberal
[23:51.480 --> 23:58.360]  democrat who believes in soviet style central planning is now a cosponsor of ron paul's
[23:58.360 --> 24:06.600]  audit the fed so at the same time he will help that part of the bill to pass the audit the fed
[24:06.600 --> 24:16.360]  he will also uh usher through more power to the fed to regulate the economy so in in some narrow
[24:16.360 --> 24:23.720]  ways that i see blossoms of liberty in the land but in other ways i see the most heavy-handed
[24:23.720 --> 24:29.480]  government we have ever known and it's almost a question of holding our breath until the democrats
[24:29.480 --> 24:34.760]  lose the filibuster proof majority in the in the senate and perhaps the majority in the house
[24:34.760 --> 24:40.280]  just 10 months from now and the bigger question is will we see a repeat of genrich the establishment
[24:40.280 --> 24:45.720]  globalist coming in taking control of the new republicans and making sure they don't deliver
[24:45.720 --> 24:50.120]  to the people because the republicans actually delivered liberty and freedom they would be in
[24:50.120 --> 24:54.440]  power for 50 years we saved the country but no they're going to want to launch more wars they're
[24:54.440 --> 24:58.200]  going to want to make money off the naked body scanners like shirt off they're going to want to
[24:58.200 --> 25:03.160]  and if republicans as they get into power in the next three years in the next two elections
[25:03.160 --> 25:11.000]  if they don't deliver on liberty what comes next well i don't know what will come next
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.120]  but when in the six years that the republicans controlled the white house of the congress which
[25:16.120 --> 25:22.360]  would be bush's first george w bush's first term and the first two years of of his second term
[25:22.360 --> 25:28.760]  i think there was less fidelity to the constitution than at any time in our history since the
[25:28.760 --> 25:34.440]  presidency of abraham lincoln the republicans have no monopoly whatsoever on fidelity to
[25:34.440 --> 25:38.680]  natural law free market in the constitution so we've got a whole version of our government
[25:38.680 --> 25:43.080]  versus the democrat version of big government so we've got to hold their feet in the fire
[25:43.080 --> 25:49.000]  and and and really vet these republicans absolutely we do and i i see this third party
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.800]  movement coming whether you call it to keep parties or whatever you want to call it i see
[25:53.800 --> 26:00.200]  independence republicans and democrats coming together in groves to kick out the incumbents
[26:00.200 --> 26:06.280]  no matter which party they're in exactly this is a real revolution a restoration of the constitution
[26:06.280 --> 26:11.000]  the people are rediscovering liberty and the system is not going to be able to scam the
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.320]  people much longer in closing judge i brought this up to you when you first got on during the break
[26:18.200 --> 26:25.160]  sec of course the whole conspiracy there we've covered that but obama informations are outlined
[26:25.160 --> 26:31.240]  plan for the government to infiltrate and provocateur conspiracy groups and we also have
[26:31.240 --> 26:38.120]  obama's tsa nominee says they want in a video they want to target anti-government christians as the
[26:38.120 --> 26:43.880]  main threat this repeats what we saw in the mayak and homeland security report saying returning vets
[26:43.880 --> 26:49.400]  gun owners are what the homeland security has really been set up for uh judge we now have
[26:49.400 --> 26:55.560]  the individual that this harvard professor cast sunstein that they're trying to put in over this
[26:55.560 --> 27:01.960]  wrote a public harvard paper a year and a half ago uh calling for provocaturing violence
[27:01.960 --> 27:06.440]  in conservative groups so the government could shut us down this is illegal of course it's
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.480]  illegal let me get this straight the government which has taken oath to uphold the law is going
[27:11.480 --> 27:15.960]  to try and provoke people to break the law people that it disagrees with politically
[27:15.960 --> 27:21.960]  so that it could destroy their organizations and lock up their their leaders does this sound like
[27:21.960 --> 27:28.920]  europe in 1939 all over again by the way he says that he says word for word so we can destroy
[27:28.920 --> 27:33.400]  their organizations he actually says that well i didn't even know he said that i was going by the
[27:33.400 --> 27:40.040]  summary uh that you gave me i think that this needs a job you're doing and i will do needs to
[27:40.040 --> 27:45.720]  be proclaimed from the rooftops people need to know what's coming they also need to remember
[27:45.720 --> 27:52.440]  that the tools that the government has to visit this harm upon us came about in the bush administration
[27:52.440 --> 27:58.520]  the patriot act and other companion legislation which went through congress with next to no debate
[27:58.520 --> 28:04.680]  and was very few members of congress reading it gave the obama administration the tools to
[28:04.680 --> 28:11.800]  invade our privacy and wreck our constitution judge what's scary to me is that he would write
[28:11.800 --> 28:20.120]  a 30 page white paper published by harvard he's not even hiding this it does it well it shows you
[28:20.120 --> 28:26.120]  their hootspa and it shows you the self-confidence with which they operate and it shows you the
[28:26.120 --> 28:31.880]  the i'll use your phrase info wars that we're going to be battling uh in the next 10 months
[28:31.880 --> 28:37.160]  that we may be battling them longer i think that the republicans will gain enough strength
[28:37.160 --> 28:43.880]  to stifle the democrats after november i think the real battle will be in the next 10 months if i'm
[28:43.880 --> 28:48.680]  wrong the real battle will be for the next three years until it's like the alamo we've got to hold
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.960]  them here while reinforcements get there there you go judge i really want to thank you for

[29:44.520 --> 29:49.560]  obama uh for this college health pro operative the the i found out about this from liberals
[29:51.480 --> 29:58.200]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:58.200 --> 30:05.240]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[30:05.240 --> 30:09.560]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[30:09.560 --> 30:14.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[30:14.600 --> 30:20.200]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[30:20.200 --> 30:25.320]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[30:25.320 --> 30:30.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[30:30.600 --> 30:35.240]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[30:35.240 --> 30:40.600]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[30:40.600 --> 30:45.000]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[30:45.000 --> 30:50.600]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com

[31:17.000 --> 31:23.000]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all

[38:53.800 --> 38:59.960]  the paper it doesn't matter if you survive the attempts to be set up then it forces you to isolate
[39:00.520 --> 39:05.960]  to not expand the size of your organization to not hire more people they talk about that and you
[39:05.960 --> 39:13.400]  know what they've been successful in that i have dealt with the infiltration ladies and gentlemen
[39:13.400 --> 39:21.640]  i have experienced it i literally live in a spy movie every single day i know how real the new
[39:21.640 --> 39:33.800]  world order is and this is going on in the obama administration it went on under bush it went on
[39:33.800 --> 39:43.640]  under clinton it's been going on for over a hundred years in this nation in the 1920s wall street was
[39:43.640 --> 39:48.520]  in trouble the people knew they were engaged in fraud and speculation that would destroy the economy
[39:48.520 --> 39:55.000]  with the upcoming depression so wall street bombed itself in that famous bombing that killed masses
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.640]  of people in fact i forget the actual number will you guys search from an encyclopedia the wall
[39:59.640 --> 40:08.200]  street bombing that's what it's known as a whole trailer full of explosives came out they did that
[40:08.200 --> 40:18.120]  wall street bombed itself to be the victim to play the victim and i've learned co until pros tricks
[40:21.320 --> 40:26.520]  38 killed 400 injured and was that in 1921 going from memory here
[40:26.520 --> 40:40.600]  December 16th 1920 september okay i can barely hear you on that mic september 16th 1920 okay
[40:43.240 --> 40:45.640]  that print that off for me then since i mentioned it thank you
[40:48.040 --> 40:56.360]  now how do you even cover something like this you know i have a limited staff of people i can
[40:56.360 --> 41:03.800]  trust a limited group of writers who i quietly watched for years and years doing their own work
[41:04.680 --> 41:07.960]  and i could analyze and tell that they weren't infiltrators
[41:11.800 --> 41:15.160]  and they can't write everything they don't have time to do everything but i've told
[41:15.160 --> 41:22.520]  paul watson steve watson curtain emo erin dykes i'm tied down to a radio making films managing
[41:22.520 --> 41:30.840]  things here at the office i've told them we need to track these people because they're so bold
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.480]  when they comment on info wars dot com prison planet dot com on youtube that a lot of times
[41:35.480 --> 41:40.600]  they'll even have their handle going back to their own page or you can search their handle
[41:40.600 --> 41:48.120]  and you will see them in military garb bragging how their psyops operators attacking the american
[41:48.120 --> 41:54.520]  people or you'll find out they're with big government funded tax-free foundations openly bragging
[41:54.520 --> 41:59.800]  and on wikipedia they have a group of editors who are allowed to do to do whatever they want
[41:59.800 --> 42:05.720]  who even give each other awards and medals online medals and and they have their own separate
[42:05.720 --> 42:11.400]  message boards bragging about all they do for the government they don't even care
[42:11.400 --> 42:20.760]  they're out in the open and they know that even the fact that they get exposed is a victory because
[42:20.760 --> 42:24.760]  then that makes everyone not trust everybody else but let me tell you how you tell these people
[42:26.760 --> 42:32.680]  generally the slicker operators will surface for a year do legitimate news work and then
[42:32.680 --> 42:37.320]  suddenly after a year of building street cred will start attacking everyone around them
[42:37.320 --> 42:47.480]  that's a big way to do it to be able to identify them and they will constantly call in to question
[42:47.480 --> 42:55.000]  any leaders who are real ron paul myself and many others what's ron paul do he covers issues he
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.480]  covers facts he brings the people together he exposes collectivism he exposes big government
[43:01.160 --> 43:06.680]  what do i do the same thing i teach you you have power i teach you that you're good you know you're
[43:06.680 --> 43:12.360]  a real person a good person then you need to be a leader i teach you that we are the majority
[43:12.360 --> 43:16.840]  but we haven't learned that yet because of the propaganda program they make us feel like we're
[43:16.840 --> 43:26.120]  isolated and all by ourselves i show you that we can have victories i shatter the left right
[43:26.120 --> 43:34.680]  paradigm i don't try to make the debate about one group in confirmed government operations
[43:34.680 --> 43:38.120]  what does the government try to do they try to factionalize divide and conquer
[43:39.720 --> 43:46.760]  all government co-intel programs try to either divide you on left or right black or white
[43:49.640 --> 43:55.960]  or they try to divide you along cults the jew hating cult the catholic hating cult
[43:57.640 --> 44:03.240]  obviously the catholic church obviously israel obviously every other major institutions
[44:03.240 --> 44:10.040]  is new world order now that's a foregone conclusion but they want to make it only about
[44:10.040 --> 44:17.320]  it being one group that way it isolates debate to only one group when this corruption is a system
[44:17.320 --> 44:26.520]  and is pandemic and systemic throughout the entire operation because when you finally shatter that
[44:26.520 --> 44:32.040]  you can't play the left off against the right you can't scare yuppies away from getting politically
[44:32.040 --> 44:39.480]  involved because they'll put the jew hater label on you and then you beat the new world order
[44:42.520 --> 44:48.920]  and we know they have caught and it has come out over and over and over again that white
[44:48.920 --> 44:55.160]  supremacist leaders hundreds of examples in europe in england and the us in canada the people
[44:55.160 --> 45:00.600]  leading the groups in canada particularly and getting people to do illegal things always end
[45:00.600 --> 45:06.040]  up working for the police they don't go out and infiltrate groups they go out and create them
[45:15.960 --> 45:19.000]  but here's the good news i want to tell a graph to everybody
[45:20.520 --> 45:28.600]  here's the good news it's over they're done it's going to be a horribly painful drawn out
[45:28.600 --> 45:40.840]  bloodletting process of capital and of treasure and of physical blood and of pain but no pain no gain
[45:40.840 --> 45:43.880]  what do they say pain is weakness leaving the body
[45:49.320 --> 45:55.240]  and it is going to be painful in a long road but the momentum has fundamentally shifted the
[45:55.240 --> 46:01.480]  globalist could stage nuke attacks they could release bio weapons they could do almost anything
[46:01.480 --> 46:09.880]  they could start new wars nothing is going to reverse their implosion and it may take a decade
[46:10.520 --> 46:11.640]  it may even be sooner
[46:14.600 --> 46:20.520]  you see they're experts at creating the narrative the storyline and then everybody just kind of
[46:20.520 --> 46:25.560]  buys into whatever the official storyline is and then you're always debating well is this
[46:25.560 --> 46:32.680]  storyline accurate they love to define things put things within a rigid grid
[46:35.160 --> 46:43.720]  parameters all we're saying is think for yourself get outside the box big government delivers
[46:43.720 --> 46:49.720]  anguish and tyranny and collapse societies we know this big government is run by a bunch of
[46:49.720 --> 46:57.160]  eugenicist control freaks let me tell you go to the catholic church you go to the zionist organizations
[46:57.160 --> 47:04.440]  you go to the big protestant leadership groups you go to any african leadership all of them are
[47:04.440 --> 47:12.040]  part of this group they are all occultist eugenicist world population reduction people it doesn't
[47:12.040 --> 47:21.080]  matter who they are the saudi arabian leadership the japanese leadership i have identified what
[47:21.080 --> 47:26.600]  they really think what they really believe who they really are and what they are is a guild of
[47:26.600 --> 47:33.880]  psychopaths did the catholic church did the protestants did the jews did they make the
[47:33.880 --> 47:41.480]  astech sacrifice more than 10 000 people a year no that was evil psychopathic guilds that got
[47:41.480 --> 47:48.680]  control of a society but see if the establishment can make the debate by people that are angry and
[47:48.680 --> 47:54.360]  awake to only be about one group or another group and then have everybody fight with each other
[47:54.360 --> 47:59.640]  over what group really runs everything and then the whole debate becomes about that instead of
[47:59.640 --> 48:06.280]  going out and educating and waking new people up to hey we're in trouble hey cut off the blood
[48:06.280 --> 48:11.880]  supply to government no matter who's really running it all of us are in trouble and see when
[48:11.880 --> 48:17.160]  they persecute one group they then get the people that are in that group to then serve the system
[48:17.160 --> 48:22.920]  believing they're being attacked by the general population by the populist movement how do you
[48:22.920 --> 48:28.280]  stop a true populist constitutional movement you go in and you divide and conquer it's so elementary
[48:28.280 --> 48:37.800]  and you read this 30 page 29 page to be precise you read this 29 page
[48:42.200 --> 48:45.960]  harvard university law school university of chicago law school paper
[48:45.960 --> 48:58.120]  by cass our sunstein and it is just off the charts incredible because it's all admitted here
[48:58.120 --> 49:05.320]  and they just publish it right out in the open they think so little of you they think you're so busy
[49:05.320 --> 49:13.960]  in fighting with each other that they can just come right out in the open and this is the man
[49:15.960 --> 49:17.160]  who has been tapped
[49:19.800 --> 49:25.480]  to be the czar of the information and regulatory affairs office obama information czar
[49:26.280 --> 49:32.600]  outlined plan for government to infiltrate conspiracy groups and that's a paul watson
[49:32.600 --> 49:37.080]  article and and he does call the paper conspiracy theories but that's just a way of labeling
[49:37.080 --> 49:40.760]  if you don't think the moon's made a cheese he calls you a conspiracy theorist but it's
[49:40.760 --> 49:45.000]  conservatives it's libertarians it's people that think the government killed jfk 90 percent of
[49:45.000 --> 49:53.400]  americans uh it's people that don't believe global warming is man made uh it's it's basically
[49:53.400 --> 50:01.400]  everybody conservatives you name it and he says we go in and we try to get him to engage in violence
[50:01.400 --> 50:07.720]  that will run off most of the pacifist people though the most threatening to us and that'll
[50:07.720 --> 50:14.600]  allow us to go in with the government and break up and arrest the rest of them he says the government
[50:14.600 --> 50:19.160]  is so discredited that if the government attacks these groups they only gain credibility we have
[50:19.160 --> 50:27.240]  to pose as other alternative media people and go after the real leadership groups that are
[50:27.240 --> 50:35.480]  threatening us and you know who that is you're listening to him right now and he describes
[50:35.480 --> 50:40.840]  everything i've talked about because i've been on the receiving end of this i've been attacked by
[50:40.840 --> 50:45.560]  this i've learned how it works and i've read the army manuals on co entel pro how they break
[50:45.560 --> 50:50.840]  up countries and offshore operations i've read much of the thousands of pages on fbi co entel
[50:50.840 --> 50:56.600]  pro to classify the seventies but this is a modern view on what they're currently doing
[50:56.600 --> 51:02.360]  and it's illegal but he doesn't care he just openly says he's doing it men are you thinking

[54:23.560 --> 54:38.440]  that i look at is calling obama george w obama that's the village voice headline
[54:39.480 --> 54:44.760]  in the last three months and i talked a lot of these people and i see them also citing
[54:46.280 --> 54:52.360]  the obama deception and fall the republic it was a devastating blow to them and i will
[54:52.360 --> 54:56.760]  commend the left even though i disagree with their collectivist views on being quicker
[54:57.560 --> 55:01.880]  to stand up against obama and to admit that they've been lied to and defrauded
[55:04.040 --> 55:10.600]  then republicans did it took republicans seven years to wake up to the fact that
[55:10.600 --> 55:17.080]  george w bush was a fraud and a liar it's now come out that he knew sedom didn't have w md's
[55:17.080 --> 55:22.680]  wanted to stay to shoot down of our own aircraft to blame it on him it's come out the white house
[55:22.680 --> 55:28.440]  was issuing fake terror alerts for political control and to give their buddies multi-billion
[55:28.440 --> 55:33.640]  dollar security contracts the same stuff's going on with obama and it's expanding
[55:35.400 --> 55:42.200]  the people are waking up to the real government the shadow national security continuity of government
[55:42.200 --> 55:51.240]  system and that's my message to all the co-intel pro people you have failed miserably sure you
[55:51.240 --> 55:56.600]  can focus on info wars dot com and in the comment sections and try to distract and divert people
[55:59.720 --> 56:04.200]  but the fight's going on on every message board on every news article on every site
[56:04.200 --> 56:10.680]  everywhere i look there's hundreds of millions of people worldwide that are totally awake now
[56:10.680 --> 56:15.880]  no and it doesn't matter if there's tens of thousands of pentagon operatives and tens of
[56:15.880 --> 56:20.200]  thousands of private corporate people that have been hired that's all admitted it doesn't matter
[56:20.200 --> 56:27.320]  how many billions you spend you cannot stop the people you've desperately tried to get
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.560]  everyone fighting with each other instead of going after the federal reserve going after
[56:31.560 --> 56:36.760]  the new world order realizing that this is the third bush administration under obama
[56:36.760 --> 56:45.400]  you have failed the more you lie the more you twist the more you spin the more you i mean you
[56:45.400 --> 56:48.920]  want to see these come and tell pro people they go on every one of our videos on youtube everywhere
[56:48.920 --> 56:54.760]  else and say this isn't true he's a liar and then people go look it up for themselves and
[56:54.760 --> 57:01.560]  find out i'm telling the truth it doesn't work on the whole flu thing they launched a huge
[57:01.560 --> 57:10.840]  co until pro on me didn't work blew up in your face nothing they throw at us works and they've
[57:10.840 --> 57:17.720]  now figured that out and they are really trying to find out a way to bring me down i want you
[57:17.720 --> 57:26.040]  to know that right now chris mathews is going to be here sunday he's coming to austin to see me
[57:26.040 --> 57:31.560]  what does that tell you i have got the eye of soran looking right at me ladies and gentlemen
[57:31.560 --> 57:37.400]  because we've got the ring and we're deep inside mordor and all of you ladies and gentlemen are
[57:37.400 --> 57:43.480]  deep inside mordor all of us together have got to carry this heavy burden up to the crack of doom
[57:43.480 --> 57:49.960]  up to that fiery opening into the earth and drop it in together we can't fight with each other
[57:49.960 --> 57:59.240]  we are so close to bringing these people down we are so close together
[58:00.920 --> 58:05.720]  we are the mainstream we are the patriots we are like our founding fathers before us
[58:05.720 --> 58:10.840]  we're not perfect but we're pure of heart we're trying to be good we're trying to tell the truth
[58:10.840 --> 58:20.360]  we're trying to stand up for what's right and as the founder of the texas rangers said a man in
[58:20.360 --> 58:26.120]  the wrong can't stand up against against a man in the right who keeps on a coming and i'm going to
[58:26.120 --> 58:30.840]  keep on a coming and keep on a coming and keep on a coming and they may cut me down ladies and
[58:30.840 --> 58:35.960]  gentlemen they may smash me flatter in the pancake but all that does is water the tree of liberty

[1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:45.960]  and as bad as the hay disaster is pray for him send him money give to multiple charities smaller
[1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:51.480]  the charity the better charities that have been in country for years i wouldn't give the big mega
[1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:55.720]  charities they've been caught over and over again keeping the money for themselves or the vast majority
[1:00:55.720 --> 1:01:02.280]  of it and in the coming days we're going to have some more guests on uh who are talking about good
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:11.640]  ways to try to support and help the folks in Haiti and later in the last hour i will play pat
[1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:16.600]  robertson on his whole thing about hating making a deal with the devil and now being punished
[1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:20.360]  and i want to play with the Haitian ambassador said about that
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:29.480]  he said well of the devil blessed us he blessed you very bizarre didn't even deny it
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:35.240]  i don't like pat robertson he's a big globalist
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:43.000]  and said that obama couldn't be stopped and obama was just gonna bring socialism and it was of the
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  lord but on the subject of Haiti if you actually look at the history that's the legend that the
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:55.160]  slave uprising was by like a voodoo chief and that they did make that deal
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:06.680]  i just think the ambassador's response was well that's what made the french fall in this hemisphere
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:12.040]  and so that's why you were able to get the Louisiana purchase
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:17.720]  and so i guess you were blessed by the devil as well
[1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:24.120]  very bizarre Haiti really is one of the most hellish countries on earth and if you do divide
[1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:30.440]  the island of hispaniola you've got the dominican republic to the east to the west you have Haiti
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:36.840]  it's divided right down the middle completely deforested i mean the forest is is amazing
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:45.480]  deforestation just amazing corruption it's like mexico a bit worse and america's gonna end up just
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:51.560]  like Haiti when you have a culture of corruption everything falls apart and you've got armored
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:03:01.320]  citadels or redoubts or keeps castles with super rich men perched on top giant sprawling slums
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:06.840]  and that's how they like it and that's what moray strong and david rockfeller and david
[1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:13.960]  iraq child want for you and your family and so i will comment on Haiti and the unbelievable
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:18.120]  devastation at least a hundred thousand dead that's been reported all over the news the last day and a
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:25.240]  half some are saying as many as 500 000 dead we will talk about that but we can try to give
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:29.880]  them money and pray for them and help them but other than that we got to focus on the healthcare
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:34.120]  takeover by the globalist here so they can put their corrupt fingers into a bigger pie
[1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:39.080]  we've got to focus on the co entel pro operations of the government
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:45.000]  that's being exposed more and more and more and more and the government's own documents and their
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:49.960]  own admissions they're not even hiding this anymore and i want to put out a major warning
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:55.000]  to all activists i want to break down the latest developments on co entel pro in the next hour and
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:01.400]  then warn you about the tricks and how you can identify it i want to write a white paper or
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:05.560]  something i don't think anybody out there's had more experience with this than i have in 14 years
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:11.560]  i mean it's been rough let me tell you sometimes i'm real tired sometimes i i'm having trouble
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:16.520]  working 14 15 16 hours a day and then they hit us with an operation and i just realized how evil
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:21.640]  they are and how wife and death this is and it just gives me energy no weapon formed against
[1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:29.160]  this shall prosper and god's really blessed me and my family and i've tried to be a good steward
[1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:37.560]  of our operation and what we do here and it's just so sick to read him laughing in these white papers
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:44.280]  the new white house a czar of information and regulatory affairs about how no one can form
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:48.360]  a political group on the left or right that actually challenges the system because they
[1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:53.960]  infiltrate them and then we're forced to shut down or make our operations smaller just to protect
[1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:58.920]  ourselves from enemy infiltration it's sabotage ladies and gentlemen
[1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:06.120]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:10.840]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:16.600]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the americans at home i have tremendous influence
[1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:22.600]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all

[1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:29.480]  censorship in china over cyber attacks london guardian google admits they've been helping china
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:36.040]  run the censoring systems for years and then yuppies and coantel pro always run around denying that
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:41.640]  but the same censoring systems have been tested here in the u.s and the white house and others
[1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:49.400]  through the cyber security system they're setting up with the nsa want to implement this here in
[1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:56.200]  the united states also another big censorship article boston globe police fight cell phone
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:02.520]  recordings witnesses taking audio of officers arrest charged with illegal surveillance all over
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:07.720]  the country people who even have cameras on their own businesses that happen to catch cops beating
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:13.480]  people up or planting drugs on them the police come arrest them for illegal wiretapping people
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:19.240]  that videotape down the street cops beating somebody up they get arrested clearly illegal to do that
[1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:26.360]  clearly not wiretapping you have no perception and no expectation of privacy when you're on the
[1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:32.840]  highway or the street and the police will tell you that all day when they're videotaping you but
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:38.040]  when you videotape them they're coming after you and they know it's fraud they know it's official
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:48.680]  oppression it's so criminal you cram a camera down our throats you illegally wire tap and scan the
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:54.760]  web and everything else you're up to and read our emails that's all illegal but then you tell us
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:59.400]  we can't videotape you i can't tell you how many times around the country i've had cops march up
[1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:06.280]  sometimes from a hundred yards away security guards from a half mile away in kansas city last year
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:11.880]  with with my camera guys saying you can't videotape in our city get out of here or i'm arresting you
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:18.920]  wiretapping people need to sue these officers they need to get in trouble the problem is the
[1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:27.000]  higher ups are telling them to do it they're arresting people that record police stops when
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.440]  they when they tell the officer i'm recording you they go really i'm going to arrest you for
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:37.560]  wiretapping you pull somebody over in their car there is no doubt in law it is their absolute
[1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:45.720]  right to record everything you're doing just like police have the right to record what you're doing
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:50.840]  when they pull you over or when they walk up to you i mean that all over the world they're
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:57.240]  mounting on police uh men's ears you know just like the little earpiece you use when you um
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:01.560]  have a cell phone similar little camera systems they're deploying them and it's the same thing
[1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:08.280]  there's no expectation of privacy in public you guys make me sick i don't hate the police
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:16.360]  i i hate the fact that you're so ignorant and you're so willing to violate the law it's just
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:24.840]  mass fraud it's mass racketeering and then i've got articles i mean every week or two where i live
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:30.520]  i hear about awesome police engaged in all forms of crimes you can imagine and this one officer
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:38.040]  has been arrested twice he's in the south austin area where i live running around he's a sergeant
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:45.720]  bombed out of his mind when the cops arrested him earlier this week he had 30 plus cans of inhalants
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:53.720]  passed out a month ago they arrested him in uniform with a gun in his truck in a parking lot
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:12:01.560]  in kyle far south austin small town south of us partially passed out we have the squad car video
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:08.600]  we're posting it up on info wars.com and they didn't even give him a dwi his car is running
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:12.680]  with a whole bunch of cans that he's just huffed
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:17.880]  and he's a commander he's a sergeant
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:25.160]  and he wasn't relieved of command when he got caught last time
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:36.840]  it's a sick joke my point is is that government always gets corrupt people
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:42.600]  in it and then they recruit more corrupt people and then once it gets to a certain point
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:46.760]  where they get most of the leadership positions and start moving in more of their people they have
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:54.440]  a word for it it starts with a letter t for tyranny and it has taken over 99 percent of
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:13:01.480]  countries and empires in history and we know how it ends we know this movie we've seen it before
[1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:10.120]  and the police in more and more areas of the country are turning into complete predatory
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:16.280]  nut jobs that was the case a few years ago in austin where this husband and wife group of cops go
[1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:22.280]  in the guy behind the counters at this cop bar said look you've had enough and they said i told you
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:29.800]  give me more they get drunk go flying off the road of their motorcycle get killed
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:33.080]  and the cops run in and arrest the bar owner
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:46.040]  they're nuts they're crazy i've had austin cops march up to me over and over again over the years
[1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:51.080]  and say turn your camera off when i'm at a demonstration telling me i can't have a camera
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:55.400]  and i tell them go ahead and arrest me but i'm gonna sue you you may beat the rap you're not
[1:13:55.400 --> 1:14:01.560]  gonna beat the ride you think i like challenging some roided up person with a gun you think it's
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:07.960]  part of being macho no i've got to defend the first amendment that george washington fought for boy
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:15.320]  you think i like this you think i like having to face you people down on a routine basis you're
[1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:24.040]  out of control you're in the wrong all right i'm gonna stop ranting i just what happens is i read
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:27.800]  news all night and all morning and then i have giant stacks of it and i can't even read it or
[1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:33.320]  focus on it on air because it's just it's just it's just it's just insane and it's getting worse
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:40.120]  and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and i have to watch foreign banks
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:46.760]  stealing trillions of dollars in front of me open crime and no one gets in trouble all right
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:48.680]  i'm gonna shut up
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:57.640]  i want to uh i want to go for the next six minutes to
[1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:07.800]  to steve shank i want to go to steve shank
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:12.200]  of efoodsdirect.com a sponsor that visits with us at least once a month
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:18.280]  because i believe firmly in everyone being self-sufficient and in these insane times that are
[1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:22.520]  clearly only going to get worse i have storeable foods i bought them a bunch of places and didn't
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:28.120]  like them this is the place i get them without the msg or the gmo high quality and the lowest price
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:32.760]  out there in the biggest selection they even have pre-made stuff that's excellent this is 21st
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:39.080]  century storeable food and it's a lot less expensive than the cruddy stuff the mre's people
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:43.160]  are selling them that are 10 years old this is fresh and new food steve good to have you on with us
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:50.360]  hey good to be aboard alex uh i i you know one of the things that that bothers me i know you have
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:54.920]  a tremendous amount of listeners that wouldn't miss one of your programs that that that agree with
[1:15:54.920 --> 1:16:02.280]  you tremendously and this last last little uh spot that i i wrote and you're going to be recording
[1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:07.320]  here fairly soon points out something that just bothers the daylights out of me the work that
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:17.080]  you do uh deserves to have people act on it and one of the things that uh that uh i'd like to
[1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:22.200]  point out to your listeners is you don't do this just to scare people the reason that you're given
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:27.240]  out this information like you just did on the policeman and and like you did on this global
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:35.240]  warming absolute fiasco is that you're trying to get them aware of what's going on so that they can
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:41.880]  act on their own behalf and and get ready for what it what all of this means and you and i've talked
[1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:47.480]  time and time again about the fact that if they can if they can provide for their own if they can
[1:16:47.480 --> 1:16:54.360]  have food in this good and tasty and nutritious that they never have to stand in a bread line
[1:16:54.920 --> 1:16:59.880]  and that bread line as you know from every other country that's gone totalitarian like you're
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:05.880]  pointing out that this country is going that bread line means if you don't want to give up your guns
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:10.280]  and you have to stand in the bread line partner you better have your own food because if you got
[1:17:10.280 --> 1:17:14.280]  your own bread you never have to stand in that bread line that's the point you're making the
[1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:18.920]  reason that you're pointing all this stuff out a lot of people you know look at you and look at me
[1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:24.520]  and i get emails once in a great while saying you're just trying to scare people the objective is
[1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:30.360]  not to scare you folks the objective is to tell you what's going on so that you can act on your
[1:17:30.360 --> 1:17:36.840]  own behalf it's simple it's simple we we we steve we sell and promote what we believe in
[1:17:36.840 --> 1:17:44.600]  in gold guns food it's simple and the co until pro doesn't want people getting together they
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:49.880]  don't want us working together they don't want us becoming self-sufficient authoritarian systems
[1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:57.400]  bankrupt societies to get people dependent that's their own admissions well and when they pointed
[1:17:57.400 --> 1:18:02.840]  out the fact that our first of all when they had to bail out all of a sudden all of the loans to
[1:18:02.840 --> 1:18:08.280]  farmers to buy fuel and the plant seed went down the toilet along with the companies that buy their
[1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:12.920]  food weren't able to get loans to buy the food from the farmers that had it and if that doesn't
[1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:18.440]  affect your food it's unbelievable but the bailout literally is affecting food in the company
[1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:25.960]  in the country and at this point all of the stuff that's happening this this global warming fraud
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:32.360]  that you finally absolutely proved is is one of the things that mr obama pointed out that the
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:38.680]  farmers are one of the biggest contributors to uh this greenhouse gas and they're they're trying
[1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:42.920]  to shut down the electrical plants for the same reason and they're going after the farmers on
[1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:48.600]  cow farts i mean it's absolutely absurd look at australia just grabbed almost all the farmland
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:53.400]  saying you just can't use your own land that you own that they're trying to push that in
[1:18:53.400 --> 1:19:00.120]  canada in the u.s i mean they want us dependent they want us bankrupted period and the one thing
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:05.640]  that families can do writing your congressman give me a break i gotta laugh about that one
[1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:12.200]  but the fact is the one thing that families can do whether they believe in guns or not the fact is
[1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:19.880]  if a family realizes what you're telling them every single time you broadcast the thing that
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:25.480]  they can do on their own behalf is be able to provide for their own take every scent that they've
[1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:30.680]  gotten put it into food if they if you don't want to work with with the e-foods direct for crying out

[1:24:54.680 --> 1:25:00.360]  prepared meals briefly tell folks about that well what this is is as a result of dealing with this
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:06.280]  for a lot of years we needed some healthy food and and stuff that tasted really good and we find
[1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:12.280]  that people just don't cook like they used to from the basics and these meals are put together
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:17.480]  they're ready to go they're really quick they're really easy as we look at what's happening alex

[1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:57.000]  to get into co-intel pro and I almost shrink from it the mental focus it'll take to properly
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:02.280]  cover all the facets because as soon as I open my mind up to the reservoirs of knowledge and
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:07.560]  research I've done on these government programs to attack and divide the people to confound the
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:15.080]  people there's just so much it's like trying to force lake superior through a straw but we're
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:20.440]  going to attempt to do that when we go live at prismplanet.tv and some will cast the radio

[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:43.880]  taking audio of officers arrest charged with illegal surveillance totally illegal what the
[1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:48.600]  police are doing and they know it there is no reasonable expectation of privacy on the streets
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:54.360]  and they know it this is happening nationwide as they try to persecute people that videotaped
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:39:04.600]  them committing crimes as big brother is turned against them that is just some of what is coming
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:14.280]  up i have four more stacks that i haven't even gotten into yet and we will cover all of that in
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:20.600]  the last hour i want to spend the whole next hour covering co entel pro and if you don't know what
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:30.760]  co entel pro is we're going to break it down okay i promise to go to calls and i'm going to go to
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:37.320]  them right now let's go to chris in new york no no chris in kentucky first have several chris
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:44.680]  chris in kentucky you're on the air hey alex hey buddy that's good talk to you listen on the news
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:50.760]  i got a couple things are going on around here um just originally on news report how some teenagers
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:55.960]  were found in haydn by using the gps system immediately i knew that here they go again now
[1:39:55.960 --> 1:39:59.880]  they're going to use a big brother system how good it is when you're in trouble for anything so put
[1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:04.120]  them in your cars put carry them on your cell phones and just do it you know they're talking about
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:09.080]  making it the law that everyone has to carry basically a cell phone that the government issues
[1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:14.760]  because it could save people and if it saves one life you know naked body scanners on the streets
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:19.560]  and in courthouses and in all the facilities and the airports if it saves one person and
[1:40:19.560 --> 1:40:28.520]  oh 152 deaths in france out of 61 million last year uh or 2008 and and so they you know they
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:34.280]  may need to ban marriages outright because if you ban human activity if there were no people you
[1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:40.120]  know if you banned shouting at each other that might save one person think of this system it's
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:46.120]  worse than guilty until proven innocent it's just you're all prisoners then meanwhile the government
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:51.240]  statistically abuses and kills more people than any other group in history but oh they're the ones
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:58.920]  running it all because they care so much about us if you go to digitette.net get that and that's
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:03.080]  probably the best way to get you can go to court secretly tape them that's the only way you're
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:06.520]  going to do it we're not seeing the police are better out here because this system has corrupted
[1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:10.520]  them and there's a lot of good ones out there i know there are we got to reach those good ones
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:14.760]  and educate and i'm not stopping and i'm also going to be on my way out the door with more copies
[1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:18.760]  of the fall of the republic and the obama deceptions because i found some former senators
[1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:23.160]  and congresspeople were there they're going in their mailboxes alex i'm getting active and i'm
[1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:32.520]  fed up well i appreciate your call chris and uh looking at my guest sheet today i uh got something
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:37.000]  backwards when we had a guest on so we're gonna we're gonna continue with your calls in the next
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:43.080]  hour if you want to hold if not folks can hang up i had looked at my sheet wrong here and notice
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:48.440]  that we do have dr paul craig roberts former number two head of policy department of treasury
[1:41:48.440 --> 1:41:53.400]  former wall street journal editor bestselling author and frequent contributor here to this
[1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:58.440]  radio show he also writes a syndicated column multiple times weekly for creator syndicate
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:03.640]  and he's with us for the next 20 minutes i wanted to get his expert take on little timmy geithner
[1:42:04.840 --> 1:42:12.280]  banker gate uh and see if he agrees with judge napolitano and others that this could be an
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:23.160]  indigable offense uh ordering the new york fed that he headed in 2008 uh their lawyers ordering
[1:42:23.160 --> 1:42:27.960]  aig not to reveal who was getting the money namely his former boss at goldman sacks who was
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:35.480]  currently treasury secretary at the time and of course that is uh henry paulson and now the
[1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:42.360]  securities and exchange commission has declared that until 2018 these documents are secret so uh
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:48.360]  this is just amazing dr roberts thanks for coming on with us sure alex good good to have you here
[1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:55.240]  banker gate i mean how deep does it go well alex i don't have any inside information on this um
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:43:01.960]  what i know i've learned from reading sir can you can you talk right on your phone we're having
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:08.120]  trouble hearing you okay there's like push up the sound how's that that is really that is really
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:12.840]  good but i mean you were the head of policy the father of reaganomics you had enough policy at
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:20.760]  the treasury i mean you know these rules uh yes um here's what may have happened let me
[1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:26.200]  briefly run through it uh without interruption and then we can talk about sure i think that what
[1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:34.760]  happened was uh aig had a whole bunch of uh i'm sorry goldman sacks had a lot of aig risk
[1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:42.520]  and it had taken various steps and some of it was hedged with the credit default swaps
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:51.800]  in which other banks had promised to reimburse goldman sacks if aig defaulted or went under
[1:43:51.800 --> 1:44:00.600]  there now when the aig risk was paid out 100 cents on the dollar of course the risk
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:06.680]  weren't that great so there was no need to pay off the risk 100 cents on the dollar
[1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:16.840]  when that happened of course goldman sacks did okay but when they when geithner announced
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:28.120]  the aig bailout he said publicly that the bailout would allow the government to liquidate aig
[1:44:29.160 --> 1:44:35.720]  so that made everybody think aig was gonna fail so what that meant was the value
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:47.400]  of the credit default swaps that goldman sacks had uh from banks as protection against aig risk
[1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:58.600]  they skyrocketed and so goldman sacks apparently sold them at some massive profit and only goldman
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:06.120]  sacks knew that aig wasn't going to fail so it looks like it's the form of insider trading
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:16.520]  of whether geithner enabled it on purpose or just through not thinking we don't know but what it does
[1:45:16.520 --> 1:45:25.400]  show is that the goldman sacks is out for every dime it can get and uh i would imagine we're not
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:30.440]  going to find out about it any more than we've been able to find out about anything else
[1:45:32.280 --> 1:45:38.440]  because uh we don't control the government uh you know who controls the government the banks
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:48.200]  groups the military security complex uh apax the insurance industry uh not congress not us
[1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:56.200]  so we're unlikely to find out and i doubt anything will will happen as a consequence
[1:45:57.880 --> 1:46:03.240]  so that's my take but that's the problem here is that we've got geithner who was heading up the
[1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:07.160]  new york fed for those that don't know that really sets the policy for the holding company
[1:46:08.040 --> 1:46:12.680]  known as the federal reserve and then he's got his former boss over at treasury paulson
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:19.720]  who said he got a waiver from treasury from his self to give himself personal bailout money
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:27.400]  and we have geithner we have all of them before congress uh saying over and over again of course
[1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:34.280]  fed chairman ben bernacky saying i won't tell you where the five hundred billion just one portion
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:40.120]  of this money uh went and so that's clearly their policy is to keep it secret who gets the
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:45.400]  bailout money who gets the free ride who gets to loot people and so then to have geithner who was
[1:46:45.400 --> 1:46:50.520]  the head of the new york fed that and they admit the new york fed lawyers instructed aig to keep
[1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:56.280]  it secret to say that geithner wasn't setting the policy that's like saying al capone uh wasn't
[1:46:56.280 --> 1:47:02.120]  involved in whiskey running in chicago in 1924 i mean it's just it's it's like saying hitler
[1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:08.840]  had no knowledge of what was happening in in the nazi party well alex i hate to say this but
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:16.280]  as far as we know the whole bailout was a scam because you know immediately following the bailout
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:22.120]  all the firms that were supposed to be threatened and we're going to bring down the world financial
[1:47:22.120 --> 1:47:27.880]  system they're all paying out six and seven figure bonuses to every member to every employee
[1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:34.120]  so the whole thing may have been a scam just like weapons of mass destruction
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:42.680]  iranian nukes or any of these fabricated uh domestic uh terrorist bomb plots
[1:47:43.560 --> 1:47:50.040]  the whole thing may have been a scam and congress stupidly gave them money without any controls
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:57.800]  so what do you think congress can do about it they can't do anything even if they were inclined
[1:47:57.800 --> 1:48:03.400]  because they're also their their election funds their campaign funds are dependent on the bank
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:14.600]  interest so the banks hold them along with uh the uh military security complex apac the members
[1:48:15.080 --> 1:48:20.600]  of of the government are all they're not independent they don't represent us
[1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:26.120]  and you can't expect that they're going to act against the people that own them
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:33.960]  and in effect they're slaves to the powerful interest groups that fund them well certainly
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:39.880]  the whole provide for their security if they lose an election they get a job well dr roberts
[1:48:39.880 --> 1:48:43.720]  certainly the whole thing is a scam i mean we have the mcclatchy newspaper reports
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:47.800]  were the internal goldman sacks documents how they were planning the whole housing
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:53.240]  implosion while telling everybody to invest in it and then they got out uh but at the same time
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:59.320]  time uh this is clear evidence of them saying oh we didn't want to make this secret i had no
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:04.120]  knowledge it was secret when they're publicly saying their policy is to make it secret it's
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:11.960]  such an insult to everyone's intelligence yeah but i know i agree with the alec uh it shows
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:18.120]  the extraordinary corruption of the government when i was in the government there was of course
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:28.920]  some corruption but not this level not just complete total corruption and in those days uh
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:35.880]  if there was corruption the people who were corrupt were in danger and often were found out
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:41.240]  and held accountable that's gone there's not going to be any accountability for any of this
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:47.880]  and and we're never going to know because then i got tell us we can only try to
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:53.560]  piece it together the way i just did for you and the listeners and i can't swear that's
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:57.640]  correct but i think that's what happened well we know they're lying and we know the sky's the
[1:49:57.640 --> 1:50:03.720]  limits so what comes next just i mean will they just put gold crowns on declare themselves kings
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:13.800]  or they don't need to because they are kings exactly to say hey look i'm the king so they
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:22.280]  in effect are and we in effect or or they're slaves look alex look at the health care debate
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:34.360]  notice how concerned the government is both congress and the white house that we can somehow
[1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:39.400]  find a way to pay for health care i mean we can't have health care unless we can pay for it they
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:46.200]  never say that about their wars or about their bank bailouts the question of oh we can't do this
[1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:53.400]  unless we can pay for it never comes up the corporate welfare never do with helping people all
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:58.680]  they can't afford that yeah they're corporate welfare that enrich the military security conflict
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:03.480]  they can they can do that forever they never even got a hi this is alex jones did you know

[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:19.080]  all right dr roberts you got cut off by the break finish up in the five minutes we've got left
[1:54:19.880 --> 1:54:23.880]  the points that you were going over i mean it's it's really elementary there's plenty of money
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:28.120]  for corporate looting corporate welfare they train the public to accept big government the
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:34.360]  name of the general public getting some goodies but really the whole system is is there for the
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:41.800]  big boys that's right there's no money for health care uh if we're going to have health care you
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:48.280]  have to go buy private insurance companies so you create 30 million more customers for them
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:53.640]  and for the poor people who of course can't afford to buy the policy we'll subsidize that
[1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:58.040]  by taking away medicare benefits that people have already paid the medicare tax for
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:05.960]  or and so oh yes we have to be so physically responsible but they're never physically responsible
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:11.720]  when it comes to their wars or to their bailouts for the richest people on earth who didn't need
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:18.120]  to bail out in the first place in my opinion there's always money they never raised the question
[1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  about how do we finance it or what happens to the deficit it's only when they're going to do something
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:30.040]  for the american people that they get parsimonious and say oh we really came forward to help the
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:35.560]  people we don't have any money well that was that was my next and final question we see robert
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:41.560]  rubin larry summers the people that engineered the current implosion i mean the real architects
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:48.600]  from bill clinton bragging and and and saying uh uh you know we're going to save you and we need
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:54.440]  all these new taxes sales taxes exercise taxes value added taxes they got glenbeck pushing it
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:58.760]  like it's conservative they've got bill o'reilly saying we need more taxes that we've got to get
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:04.120]  control of this deficit uh we don't need to cut spending no government needs to get bigger we're
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:09.480]  just going to raise more taxes on the middle class yeah there's not much left of the middle class
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:17.240]  but that is exactly right that proves the point that i was making and keep in mind alex the minute
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:24.920]  here's what i think happened the minute the american public fell for their 911 story the power people
[1:56:24.920 --> 1:56:30.200]  in washington realized that we were so gullible we would believe anything they could tell us anything
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:35.560]  and so they told us oh the whole world financial system is going to collapse if you don't give
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:41.640]  multiple billionaires hundreds of billions even trillions of dollars and the people fell for it
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:48.120]  i think they saw with the way they fooled us with 911 then we'd believe anything
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:53.880]  there's nothing they can't tell the american people the american people wouldn't believe
[1:56:53.880 --> 1:56:58.520]  well that's like the naked body scanners now they say they're going in courthouses nationwide
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:03.240]  denver and other cities already have them so you're going to pay a ticket they record your naked body
[1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:07.560]  and we've now discovered they're using it as a biometric scan and that's what these really are
[1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:13.080]  as biometric readers so they can passively read you on the street now off of your body signature
[1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:18.680]  well i wouldn't be surprised but the reason really that doing it is it turn off is the head
[1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:25.320]  of all that he's making billions of dollars selling body scanners that's the former head of homeland
[1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:31.960]  security remember yes i it's just he's the one who uh in charge of who he's the head of these
[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:37.000]  companies that make these body scanners or if he's not head of those companies he's head of the ones
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:44.440]  that market them so he's raking in the money it's just the old it's just the old boys making
[1:57:44.440 --> 1:57:50.680]  themselves rich they sold us terror you see but now they're going wilder than they've ever gone
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:57.160]  why are they going so hog wild crazy openly robbing everything because they found out with 911
[1:57:57.160 --> 1:58:03.960]  we'll believe anything we'll fall for anything they can get away with it and of course you're
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:09.720]  saying we believe it you and you're coming right out now saying 911 was staged look
[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:19.960]  how many thousands of engineers architects airline pilots fighter pilots air traffic controllers
[1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:27.560]  intelligence agents the former government officials here and abroad it said that the whole story is
[1:58:27.560 --> 1:58:32.440]  not believable oh i know it's an inside job i i said it two months before it happened you know

[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:27.880]  i wanted to keep
[2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:35.640]  dr paul craig roberts was another five minutes because i wanted to get his take
[2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:41.400]  i want the village voice uh raw story and others have reported on we've got a detailed report at
[2:00:41.400 --> 2:00:48.600]  prisonplanet.com obama informations are outlined plan for government to infiltrate conspiracy
[2:00:48.600 --> 2:00:54.200]  groups and then it says anybody that criticizes the government anti-war liberals people think the
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:01:02.440]  government killed kennedy he says get into their groups try to make them violent so that we can
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:08.280]  arrest them so that we can shut them down so that we can make them look radicalized and this is the
[2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:15.400]  harvard professor cas sonstein obama's appointee to head the office of information and regulatory
[2:01:15.400 --> 2:01:25.480]  affairs uh your comments on that well alex i don't i don't know anything about it but i would not
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:33.880]  be surprised it's it's uh happened before in history the czarist secret police used to do that they
[2:01:33.880 --> 2:01:40.840]  would infiltrate groups and then set off bombs and then arrest the groups and we know from the
[2:01:40.840 --> 2:01:51.160]  italian uh the former president of italy uh who revealed the uh program by which the cia and
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:58.120]  italian intelligence during the 60s 70s and 80s went around setting off bombs uh blaming the
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:04.600]  communists in order to discredit them at polls at the polls so they wouldn't get elected so
[2:02:05.800 --> 2:02:12.760]  this is uh this has happened before now this and of course the fbi and other groups have infiltrated
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:22.280]  various uh the so-called uh supremacist groups and uh various kinds of right-wing organizations in
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:31.400]  the united states and probably left wing ones so it's not new but it is uh an increase in in the
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:40.280]  level and this time it's designed to shut down all criticism and all information that's
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:52.520]  on favorable to the government and so it is definitely a step toward a total police state if the report is correct well yeah no he
[2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:59.480]  published it with the harvard and uh chicago business school press put it out uh in in 2008
[2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:05.960]  he's now in the administration the issue for me here is yeah we knew in 71 the fbi was doing this
[2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:13.000]  in the committees that exposed it but now to have them out in the open as policy saying do it it just
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:18.360]  shows the arrogance now where they just do whatever they want i think that's true they can do whatever
[2:03:18.360 --> 2:03:26.360]  they want that's that's part that's true and so the question really is how long you and i can
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:34.440]  continue to speak out about it or anybody else they could already grab they can already grab
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:42.120]  whoever they want because they've breached habeas corpus for americans you know they're
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:49.720]  now holding americans uh in detention without bringing charges so we're back to the middle
[2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:57.000]  ages and it's like you said earlier they are kings or aristocrats princes really robber barons
[2:03:57.880 --> 2:04:01.880]  and they do what they want and there's no accountability and it doesn't matter what
[2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:09.480]  scandal gets revealed nothing happens to them there's no accountability for the fact that we
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:17.320]  what we all know now that the bush administration intentionally deceived us and the entire world
[2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:23.160]  about weapons and mass destruction in iraq and so we invaded the country committed
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:29.800]  unmentionable uncountable war crimes millions of deaths and displaced people our own troops
[2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:38.280]  and there's no accountability none this is the most egregious act of treason in our history
[2:04:38.840 --> 2:04:43.400]  amazing nobody cares nothing is done about it nothing well people are starting to not even

[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:29.240]  the documents the video clips that we're talking about here on the radio you see this man this
[2:08:29.240 --> 2:08:36.040]  man right here is casar sunstein university of chicago law school he wrote this in conjunction
[2:08:36.040 --> 2:08:44.680]  with harvard university law school public law and legal theory research paper and this was from 2008
[2:08:44.680 --> 2:08:53.400]  he's now becoming a key member of the obama administration over information and technology
[2:08:53.960 --> 2:09:00.520]  and that's why this is so important he'll be the head of the office of information and regulatory
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:12.360]  affairs and in the white paper the 29 page white paper that you see on screen titled conspiracy
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:19.960]  theories he labels anyone that doesn't believe global warming is man made anyone who believes
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:26.200]  the official story of kennedy's alive anyone who believes the cia is involved in drug dealing
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:34.360]  if you believe government ever did anything corrupt ever you are a conspiracy theorist so he
[2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:41.160]  first labels you that'd be like in uh you know russia them them labeling you a capitalist it's
[2:09:41.160 --> 2:09:48.360]  just a way to demonize you during the soviet era or in nazi germany labeling someone a a communist
[2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:54.200]  or a jew and that's the term they use i mean national television says that if you don't agree
[2:09:54.200 --> 2:09:59.240]  with government run health care you're a racist or you're a conspiracy theorist this is the term
[2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:05.320]  they use if you say the banker bailout was a fraud they call it a conspiracy theory if you say that
[2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:12.600]  uh water is wet the sky is blue and birds sing you're a conspiracy theorist basically it's a
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:20.760]  way to just set the parameters to set the narrative of the debate and say we are the boss you're not
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:27.560]  allowed to question anything we do and if you critically think or read legislation or if you're
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:33.640]  do anything other than watch football and suck your thumb or go get collagen injections in your
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:41.160]  lips if you do anything but party and just let us run everything you know you're good if you just
[2:10:41.160 --> 2:10:45.800]  stand out and let us run everything but if you question anything you're a conspiracy theorist

[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:26.680]  tricks and seen the tricks being used against us and it came out the pentagon for decades has been
[2:11:26.680 --> 2:11:32.280]  spying and co and tell pro and in fighting and planting bombs all over the world and in the
[2:11:32.280 --> 2:11:38.200]  us to blame it on their political enemies they do this over and over again the fbi does it they
[2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:45.800]  have huge divisions that do it but that had to be declassified by congress resting it away from the
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:55.960]  fbi it was more than a 10-year battle to get this in the 1970s now this guy publishes this in full
[2:11:55.960 --> 2:12:04.440]  public view and he is calling for crimes it is a crime to try to get somebody into my office
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:11.400]  somebody we hire and to try to have them to get us to commit crimes remember something similar
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:15.400]  to that the fbi did and the u.s. attorney with tommy chong we've interviewed him about this
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:21.880]  tommy chong actor comedian no criminal record his son's got a pipe company selling pipes that are
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:29.000]  legal except in a few counties in the u.s of thousands of counties it took them four plus years
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:35.400]  to get someone hired into their factory hundreds of times the u.s. attorney through other names
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:41.160]  tried to order the pipes into that county where it was illegal they finally had to get someone
[2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:47.400]  employed there who wasn't even in shipping to go in and pack it and ship it and the federal court
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:12:54.600]  said yeah we went in we mailed the pipe but tommy chong goes to prison folks we don't sell glass
[2:12:54.600 --> 2:12:59.560]  pipes but if i hire the wrong person they'll come in here and ship something like that out and they'll
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:05.080]  say in federal court yes we came in we planted it and the courts are so corrupt they'll say
[2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:13.240]  alex jones goes to prison now it came out that howl turner in fact pull up kurt nemo's excellent
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:17.800]  article from the federal court documents this has been in major newspapers we just link to them
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:25.960]  that howl turner one of the top five nazis in the u.s is an fbi agent not an informant an agent
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:33.560]  for national security ultra top secret clearance i told you that a decade ago who does he attack me
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:39.320]  they also want to radicalize the message they want to radicalize mainline libertarians
[2:13:39.320 --> 2:13:44.440]  conservatives so we can be politically demonized so we don't become mainstream and take our country
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:49.880]  back that's why if you say you don't want big government i don't want health care i i i think
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:53.560]  it's a boondoggle to insurance companies to raise our taxes and cut medicare and medicaid
[2:13:54.440 --> 2:14:01.000]  oh you don't like black people chris matthew says carlos watson says they all say it heath oberman
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:07.080]  that's a talking point of co entelepro you're like what does race have to do with us we weren't
[2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:14.200]  talking about black people no i'm talking about banks here that mean you think jews are evil
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:22.840]  and i say no i'm talking about banks here that mean you think jews are evil and i say no i'm
[2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:29.080]  talking about banks here you know they stole money they should be held accountable um christ
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:34.200]  mathews is coming here sunday to interview me i said let me guess talking to his producer you're
[2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:40.120]  gonna cut from the coup clark's clan to me and they laughed and said yeah that's basically it
[2:14:41.240 --> 2:14:46.200]  and i said well i guess i can't say no you're just gonna play clips of me from other news channels
[2:14:46.200 --> 2:14:51.640]  and mix me in i said fine i'm not gonna be a coward even though it's a rigged taped interview
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:57.720]  i'll stand up to the dragon i'm not looking forward to it though i mean but i'm gonna bring
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:01.720]  this stuff up to mathews but of course he'll be taping it so it'll never be seen he'll be able
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:08.120]  to cut out what he wants now i want to take my time this hour going over this not just how they're
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:13.080]  doing it in the history of it and what's currently happening but how you can counter it and the fact
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:18.760]  that they're losing their fight why do you think the feds bombed oklahoma city to demonize the
[2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:24.200]  conservative and libertarian movement and if you've researched that case a hundred percent evidence
[2:15:24.200 --> 2:15:31.320]  the batf bombed it 100 on record and they had to kill coroners police officers you name it in
[2:15:31.320 --> 2:15:37.480]  Oklahoma city to cover that up okay and it came out in federal documents that the southern poverty
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:46.440]  law center was running elaheem city that mcvay was at running it every case folks they don't
[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:51.960]  infiltrate white supremacist and and peace activist and mainline conservatives and in the fed groups
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:58.760]  they are there trying to shut them down and in the case of of white supremacists they don't just
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:05.160]  infiltrate them they found them they run them or they found other patriot groups to then attack
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:10.600]  other patriot groups ladies and gentlemen this is their full pentagon operation now i'm going to
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:15.080]  go to watch in this segment the next and then let him go but he wrote the most detailed article on
[2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:22.680]  this uh at prisonplanet.com give people a document cam shot obama informations are outlined plan for
[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:28.840]  government to infiltrate conspiracy groups again a modern version of coantel pro and i've read this
[2:16:28.840 --> 2:16:35.160]  this is illegal he's calling for illegal stuff uh in fact uh i've got the encyclopedia here on
[2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:42.280]  coantel pro and it says coantel pro acronym for counterintelligence program was a series of covert
[2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:48.840]  and often illegal projects conducted by the united states federal government of investigation the
[2:16:48.840 --> 2:16:54.920]  federal bureau investigation aimed at investigating and disturbing disrupting dissonant political
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:17:01.640]  organizations within the united states the fbi use covert operations from its inception and then it
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:08.040]  goes into the declassified coantel pro okay that is declassified coantel pro you can read thousands
[2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:15.960]  of pages of documents this guy part of the obama administration this guy with billions of dollars
[2:17:15.960 --> 2:17:23.720]  at his fingertips smugly and arrogantly thinks he can set the precedent to come out in the open
[2:17:23.720 --> 2:17:32.440]  and call for modern 21st century coantel pro now it's all going on already but this guy lays out
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:38.040]  all their tricks and that's what blew me away he talks about how we've been discredited the
[2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:42.200]  government's discredited so what we've got to do is we've got to pose as other conspiracy theorists
[2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:51.640]  that's anybody that questions government to counter the the real people that are questioning
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:56.920]  and he talks about it's all in coantel pro the number one thing they do is if somebody starts
[2:17:56.920 --> 2:18:01.080]  selling books and videos to fund an organization starts becoming successful they say oh they're
[2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:05.240]  getting rich they've got money that's how they broke up all the other groups that were real in
[2:18:05.240 --> 2:18:11.480]  the 60s they send in people to cause violence they spread lies about you their favorite coantel pro
[2:18:11.480 --> 2:18:17.720]  is to say leaders of the real movement are threatening to kill people i wondered why i would
[2:18:17.720 --> 2:18:22.200]  get calls at the officer people and and talk to them and nothing would be said and then they would
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:27.880]  go say i'd threaten to kill them and this happens over and over again where now if it's somebody
[2:18:27.880 --> 2:18:33.720]  i don't know i turn speakerphone on and go guys i need you to listen and a lot of times i just hit
[2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:38.920]  a record button and start recording because i've got to protect myself folks they're coming at me
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:43.240]  i've had them try to drop stuff off at the office and then claim stuff i mean i mean ladies and
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:49.400]  gentlemen we've got them coming out of the woodwork here and then to look at this smiley face guy
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:56.440]  in the obama administration about to be confirmed as a czar he just thinks it's all funny if you
[2:18:56.440 --> 2:19:01.720]  did this to him you'd go to prison but see he is an anointed one watch and i've had you on hold
[2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:05.800]  while i've been ranting it's just we have been through hell with these people he talks about
[2:19:05.800 --> 2:19:13.160]  how to go on message boards how to get in fighting going how to make up lies we we witness what they
[2:19:13.160 --> 2:19:20.600]  do every day don't we yeah we've been tracking it for a long time alex and um other wrote in the
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:28.120]  article uh we have anonymous posters and we allow them to be anonymous by our system i mean we could
[2:19:28.120 --> 2:19:34.040]  make everyone register but it'd just mean a lot less discussion in there so we allow people to be
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:40.760]  anonymous and then from the back end i can see where these people have got the same ip address so
[2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:46.920]  you know it's the same person but they're posting under different names and then creating a fake
[2:19:46.920 --> 2:19:52.520]  conversation with these alter egos and that's what he says stay there he says create fake
[2:19:52.520 --> 2:19:58.760]  consensus with multiple posters he's blueprinting what we're witnessing and they don't even hide
[2:19:58.760 --> 2:20:04.520]  their ip's they're government i mean the government is attacking us and trying to get people to commit

[2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:29.320]  the understanding to track it back and then sue you i'm not just some bumbling little liberal
[2:24:29.320 --> 2:24:33.800]  or conservative group you're going to be able to successfully do this and i call for criminal
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:38.680]  investigations against this obama administration official i mean wait till i read the quotes of
[2:24:38.680 --> 2:24:44.600]  what he's calling for i mean if i wrote stuff calling for criminal infiltration getting people
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:24:50.600]  to call for violence criminal acts i would get in big trouble it's they think they're above the law
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:54.840]  they think they can get away with all this they think it's funny paul watson go ahead and go
[2:24:54.840 --> 2:24:59.960]  through some of the stuff they call for in there well what's interesting about the individual
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:06.600]  himself is that he's a obama's informations are you the head of information technology at the
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:13.160]  white house with executive powers and in the past he's called for reformulating the first
[2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:19.800]  amendment and internet censorship but what he does in this 29 page document which is linked
[2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:27.320]  from the article which can download is he first defines what a conspiracy theory is and we found
[2:25:27.320 --> 2:25:32.280]  we find out by his very definition that it's basically anybody who disagrees with the government
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:39.080]  he says that people who believe that some practice or event by reference to the machinations of
[2:25:39.080 --> 2:25:44.440]  powerful people have also managed to conceal their role in that event is a conspiracy theory so
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:50.600]  believing that powerful people try to influence events to increase their power or money is a
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:57.000]  conspiracy theory and if you do that they should infiltrate you and send you to prison i mean if
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.360]  i sit here and say aig and goldman sacks and the fellow reserve are openly involved in crime
[2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:08.200]  publicly that doesn't exist because he sets the confines of reality and i need them to come in
[2:26:08.200 --> 2:26:14.760]  here and sit set me up to go to prison right and it gets crazier on page five he says that
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:22.600]  um having being exposed to sunlight the notion that that's healthy to get sun on you is a
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:28.040]  false and dangerous conspiracy theory so sunlight's bad now that's a conspiracy theory
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:32.760]  and then what this guy's on a power trip they literally think they're god
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:40.440]  the most disturbing thing is on page 14 you know it gets worse than him just saying
[2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:47.800]  infiltrate groups and get them to provocateur things on page 14 he says that the following
[2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:55.640]  measures each will have a place under imaginable condition so he's saying they will have a place
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:27:01.000]  and he's powerful he's got executive powers he's in the white house he's one of obama's key advisors
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:08.360]  so each of these measures again is going to have a place under this system one government might ban
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:16.200]  conspiracy theorizing literal thought crime we gotta have a headline from curtain mo calls for
[2:27:16.200 --> 2:27:22.440]  thought crime laws i mean this you disagree with government if you think that getting out in the
[2:27:22.440 --> 2:27:29.480]  sunshine is healthy then they're gonna ban your free speech to government might impose some kind
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:36.040]  of tax financial or otherwise on those who disseminate such theories so a tax on disagreeing
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:44.920]  with the government which is interesting because um sunstein has called for tax day to be celebrated
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:50.040]  he thinks it's wonderful that the government rapes us every year so he's a big fan of that and now
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:55.640]  he'll make a religion out of the right thing yes now he wants to put a tax on if you think that
[2:27:55.640 --> 2:28:03.240]  sunlight's healthy uh through government might itself engage in counter speech marshaling arguments
[2:28:03.240 --> 2:28:07.800]  to discredit conspiracy theories and then it gets into the infiltration from there on in
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:13.240]  so take our tax money for our speech and and give it to government groups to counter us
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:21.800]  exactly and then after he started talking about this infiltration of what he calls conspiracy
[2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:29.720]  groups i anyone who still has two brain cells to rub together he says such as mainstream scientists
[2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:36.040]  or the editors of popular mechanics whom government attempts to enlist to give credibility to its
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:43.240]  rebuttal efforts so he's basically admitting that when popular mechanics came out and uh
[2:28:43.880 --> 2:28:49.000]  you know stood behind the official 9 11 story when it was under the most severe attack back in
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:56.120]  uh 2005 is when they first came out the popular mechanics was enlisted by the government to do
[2:28:56.120 --> 2:29:03.960]  that he openly admits it on page 18 well he goes on to say we can't use government people will use
[2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:10.360]  allies like popular mechanics and not let people know that we're funding them exactly so that's
[2:29:11.240 --> 2:29:16.840]  that's what was happening we knew it but now they admit it what's important to take from
[2:29:16.840 --> 2:29:24.040]  this as i wrote at the end of the article though was this proves how much success we've had on page
[2:29:24.040 --> 2:29:30.840]  three sunstein writes quote the existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories we suggested
[2:29:30.840 --> 2:29:36.600]  no trivial matter posing real risks to the government anti-terrorism policies whatever the
[2:29:36.600 --> 2:29:41.240]  lack there may be oh stay there stay there we're going to come back five more minutes go through

[2:32:59.560 --> 2:33:13.480]  again that number 1-800-409-5633 now again i'm going to go through the history of coantel pro
[2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:19.720]  what's currently happening but the big issue here is this guy's talking about banning criticism of
[2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:26.520]  government putting taxes on newspapers and magazines that criticize government and we see obama coming
[2:33:26.520 --> 2:33:32.600]  out and saying my new cyber security czar will censor the web the nsa and army and air force will
[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:39.160]  run it we see all these headlines about should obama control the internet the cyber security
[2:33:39.160 --> 2:33:45.560]  czar the first one they appointed early last year in february resigned saying the pentagon's
[2:33:45.560 --> 2:33:52.120]  taking over they're spying on everyone there's the wall street journal headline security cyber
[2:33:52.120 --> 2:34:00.120]  czar steps down so this is real bona fide tyranny any and he uses an extreme or welly an example
[2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:05.640]  if you say two plus two equals four and he says that's a conspiracy theory he says it's five
[2:34:06.520 --> 2:34:11.240]  they want it to be idiotic they want to set the precedent that they kill
[2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:17.160]  collage shake mohammed more than a dozen times and never retract the last time they
[2:34:17.160 --> 2:34:22.280]  claimed they killed him and then the next time they capturing you know openly saying we're going to
[2:34:22.280 --> 2:34:27.640]  put him on trial after seven years of torture setting these precedents look at this coantel
[2:34:27.640 --> 2:34:33.080]  pro an an acronym for counterintelligence program was a series of covert and often illegal that's
[2:34:33.080 --> 2:34:39.080]  what he's calling for projects conducted by the united states federal bureau investigation aimed
[2:34:39.080 --> 2:34:44.200]  at investigating and disrupting dissonant political organizations within the united states the fbi
[2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:49.800]  used covert operations from its inception however formal coantel pro operations took place between
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:55.640]  1956 and 71 the and they took over all the state police you name it the fbi stated motivation at
[2:34:55.640 --> 2:35:00.440]  the time was protecting national security preventing violence and maintaining the existing social
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:07.480]  order of political order according to the fbi 85 percent of coantel pro resources were expended
[2:35:07.480 --> 2:35:13.240]  on infiltrating disrupting marginalizing and or subverting groups suspected of being subversive
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:18.440]  suspected and then this was what was popular so they only released this at the time it was really
[2:35:18.440 --> 2:35:22.680]  after conservatives in the john bird society they were going after but uh such as communist
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:26.840]  socialist organizations the women's rights movement there's now come out the cia funded
[2:35:26.840 --> 2:35:31.720]  that that's baloney militant black nationalist groups they did go after them and nonviolent
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:36.760]  civil rights movements including individuals such as martin luther king and others associated
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:42.600]  with the southern christian leadership conference and it just goes through now we know modern coantel
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:48.840]  pro is all peace groups all libertarian groups all in the fed groups this has all been leaked or
[2:35:48.840 --> 2:35:54.680]  declassified the last three years the mayac report the homeland security that law enforcement gave us
[2:35:54.680 --> 2:35:59.000]  where they list gun owners conservatives that's what homeland security is really set up for and
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:07.240]  here's the deal they're now coming out in the open uh with the new head of tsa in fact i had that in
[2:36:07.240 --> 2:36:13.000]  my stack well you guys print that again uh last week that the new head of the tsa being approved
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:19.640]  right now in congress gave a video speech and said our number one threat is christians and people
[2:36:19.640 --> 2:36:26.200]  that have a christian identity and and that's the main threat i mean these guys paul watson why do you
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:31.720]  think they're now coming right out in the open and saying we want to ban speech we want to infiltrate
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:39.640]  you we want to arrest you i mean this is hitlerian or stylistic or malice i mean this is out in the
[2:36:39.640 --> 2:36:47.080]  open they're doing it because they've become painfully aware of the fact that the sleeping
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:53.480]  giant of the american people and the rest of the world is slowly awakening to their tyranny
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:58.120]  i mean that's what he says on page three yeah go back to that the break interrupted you spend
[2:36:58.120 --> 2:37:03.880]  some time on that he says just like three years ago they had that uh congressional meeting on
[2:37:03.880 --> 2:37:10.040]  extremist and showed mainline 911 truth groups and said these are terrorists yeah and that there
[2:37:10.040 --> 2:37:16.520]  was that 2006 white house directive under bosh which said that conspiracy theories were a well
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:21.960]  spring of terrorism and that that they had to be defeated so this goes back to bosh it's not just
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:29.960]  an obama thing and on page three of this white paper sunstein says the existence of both domestic
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:35.480]  and foreign conspiracy theories we suggested no trivial matter posing real risks to the
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:41.000]  government's anti-terrorism policies whatever the latter may be so there he's saying that the people
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:46.360]  are slowly awakening to the agenda of the military industrial complex and it's becoming a problem for
[2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:55.080]  them now what's interesting about his solution to it later on he admits that in a repressive society
[2:37:56.040 --> 2:38:02.440]  more conspiracy theories emerge which is true because governments lie and oppress people and
[2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:08.440]  the people become more suspicious of government and bearing in mind conspiracy theory means
[2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:12.680]  disagreeing with the government on any fact whatsoever that's basically how it's defined
[2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:19.240]  so he says that repressive societies produce conspiracy theories but then he says just ban free
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:25.800]  speech as a solution on page 20 he says we could imagine circumstances in which a conspiracy
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:32.040]  theory became so pervasive and so dangerous which in their eyes is what 911 truth was becoming
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:39.240]  a few years ago that censorship would be thinkable so again he's saying ban free speech
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:45.880]  as i said before page 14 he said ban conspiracy theories well by the way mainstream news is
[2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:54.440]  reporting that the tsa nominee a former fbi agent uh is erole summers souther's is openly on
[2:38:54.440 --> 2:39:00.280]  videos saying the number one threat is christians and anti-global warming groups they're saying
[2:39:00.280 --> 2:39:06.760]  the terror threat is the anti-global warming groups totally peaceful and you have europe
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:13.560]  openly calling for banning them the london guardian saying charge lord montan with treason
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:21.160]  and execute him exactly and that's another one of the uh conspiracy theories listed in this
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:27.560]  report is that on page four along with um the conspiracy theory that powerful people were
[2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:33.560]  involved in this destination of jfk which about 90 percent of the american people now fully believe
[2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:39.480]  so these people don't even realize all that hope but doesn't allow them to recognize the
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:45.240]  fact that they're now the minority but it also lists global warming as a deliberate
[2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:51.160]  fraud that's also a conspiracy theory questioning global warming which has proven to be a complete
[2:39:51.160 --> 2:39:57.640]  broad in light of climate gate so all along the line he's saying basically that any
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:03.960]  dissension against the prevailing authority of government and whatever they say is a conspiracy
[2:40:03.960 --> 2:40:10.360]  theory and should be counted now now paul i want this to sink in for people congressional reports
[2:40:10.920 --> 2:40:16.760]  bush obama everyone he's appointing his own cyber security chief quits and says this is a
[2:40:16.760 --> 2:40:22.760]  pentagon takeover they're spying on everything this is all illegal they just don't care and now
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:29.240]  they're saying arrest people who don't believe in man-made global warming and the head of the new
[2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:37.080]  tsa says that's the threat i mean these people are outrageous villains i mean it's they know
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:43.560]  they're villains they know i mean this the new head that obama is trying to put in here and i
[2:40:43.560 --> 2:40:50.680]  want to show a screenshot of him here from the document cam i mean it is so incredible to have
[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:58.120]  cast our sunstein openly writing this and now in the executive czar position over information
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:04.760]  with billions of dollars at his fingertips he again he's openly calling for infiltrating in
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:11.320]  his words peaceful groups and getting them to engage in violence or talking about violence
[2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:17.240]  to run off peaceful members and so they can then entrap and imprison the other people i mean this
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:24.120]  is so dangerous that they're in the open saying it we know it's always and and then you read over
[2:41:24.120 --> 2:41:31.000]  what he calls for in the 29 page document it's everything in co until pro from the 70s and more
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:37.720]  i mean this is a blueprint to carry out these crimes and a reign of terror and he's saying
[2:41:37.720 --> 2:41:44.840]  ban free speech and start arresting people outright if they criticize the government in any way i mean
[2:41:44.840 --> 2:41:52.040]  it's so outrageous paul as well as a tax on political opinions that the government disagrees
[2:41:52.040 --> 2:41:59.000]  with and yeah then you've got this other obama appointee errol thothers who is trying to get
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:05.720]  to head up the tsa that's being resisted but it could go through and we did an article on this
[2:42:05.720 --> 2:42:11.960]  on monday in which he said that people who are anti-government or even anti-abortion if you if
[2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:18.200]  you disagree with abortion then you're a threat and he says that people who have those opinions
[2:42:18.200 --> 2:42:22.760]  should be treated as the main terrorist threat which is exactly what's happening in airports
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:29.480]  when we think of people like the ron paul treasurer who was carrying some campaign money and some
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:35.800]  ron paul political material and he was arrested and interrogated for an hour simply because he
[2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:40.920]  was carrying this political material so they're identifying their political enemies who were
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:46.440]  the main threat to their agenda to their tyranny and that is libertarians and conservatives and
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:53.480]  basically anyone who has two brain cells to rub together they are actual Stalinists i mean
[2:42:54.120 --> 2:43:01.400]  there is no doubt that they're saying they want to take over an arrest us i mean these are outrageous
[2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:08.680]  criminals that it is outrageous i mean it is just they've stolen 28 trillion publicly
[2:43:08.680 --> 2:43:12.680]  they're openly engaged in fraud they're robbing everything their health care bill
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:19.160]  raises taxes cuts benefits as a giant ripoff they're just running around putting surveillance in
[2:43:19.160 --> 2:43:25.720]  naked body scanners in the courthouses biometrically scanning everyone i mean there is no doubt paul
[2:43:25.720 --> 2:43:32.680]  this is a bona fide tyranny and it's not as if this was just some idea that he was proposing
[2:43:32.680 --> 2:43:39.400]  this has been going on for years it's admitted that think com has been employing people to go
[2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:46.760]  into chat rooms social networking forums and engage bloggers who they say post incomplete
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:53.480]  or false information about the war on terror then the pentagon in 2008 said they were expanding
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:58.680]  similar operation and setting up fake news websites that were designed to look like
[2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:04.760]  independent media but instead would carry military propaganda you know israel as i
[2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:10.520]  admitted that they've got an army of bloggers to act as apologists for israel's war crimes
[2:44:10.520 --> 2:44:14.200]  and the us air force announced that they had a similar program as well
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:20.440]  and those uh... links are all in the article though it's been going on for years and now
[2:44:20.440 --> 2:44:27.480]  this old farmers are he's talking about expanding it rapidly and bringing in enforcement powers
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:31.960]  to ban opinions that they don't like now here's the good news
[2:44:33.080 --> 2:44:42.520]  uh... the village voice raw story the rag blog got fascism obama advisor promotes cognitive
[2:44:42.520 --> 2:44:49.320]  infiltration your government appointees at work cast sunsteen seeks cognitive provocateurs
[2:44:49.320 --> 2:44:55.000]  then they quote him from the document we suggest a distinctive tactic for breaking up the hardcore
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:45:00.840]  extremist who supply conspiracy theories cognitive infiltration of extremist groups whereby
[2:45:00.840 --> 2:45:07.640]  government agents or their allies acting either virtually on the internet or in real space
[2:45:08.840 --> 2:45:17.160]  and either openly or anonymously will undermine the uh... crippled uh... system of believers by
[2:45:17.160 --> 2:45:24.360]  planting doubts about the theories and stylized facts that circulate with such groups thereby
[2:45:24.360 --> 2:45:29.160]  introducing beneficial cognitive uh... diversity and so what he's saying is
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:34.120]  we'll get any talks about going in and criticizing saying things are lies
[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:40.200]  getting people fighting with each other radicalizing uh... groups and it goes on and on and and
[2:45:40.200 --> 2:45:43.640]  paul when i was reading this thirty page document last night or twenty nine page
[2:45:44.440 --> 2:45:47.960]  it's everything we've experienced it's everything we've gone through how they talk about
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:54.920]  about real groups that are exposing the power structure we go out and and poses conspiracy
[2:45:54.920 --> 2:46:00.280]  theorist and and and that's what co until pro says oh say they're making money to make people
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:05.800]  jealous say that they're working for the government and just get all this infighting going on but
[2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:11.480]  the good news is the left is waking up the right's waking up now they may be attacking our sites
[2:46:11.480 --> 2:46:17.320]  but when you look at a big raw story or something every comment is arrest the bankers every comment
[2:46:17.320 --> 2:46:21.880]  i mean almost every comment and some articles it is every comment the bankers are bad they control
[2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:28.200]  both parties on the raw story they're like oh my god obama so bad they own them all what do we do
[2:46:28.200 --> 2:46:35.000]  finally it's all shattering and so they may have tens of thousands of hired people out doing this
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:40.680]  but so many people are standing up and getting involved uh... that it's not working anymore
[2:46:40.680 --> 2:46:46.520]  i mean that's really the good news here now is that their own left that was the victims of this
[2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:51.400]  in the fifty sixties and seventies are now realizing just how evil this is and just
[2:46:51.400 --> 2:46:55.640]  just how bankrupt the system is so the good news is this isn't working paul
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:02.520]  no it's not it only goes to show i mean people are always saying what can we do what can we do
[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:08.680]  we're powerless we can't be powerless if these people are writing 30 page dossiers about how
[2:47:08.680 --> 2:47:15.080]  they're terrified of the impact we're having on society and what's ironic about it is if you go to
[2:47:15.080 --> 2:47:22.200]  my article about it today the very first comment is an example of one of these people at work and then
[2:47:22.200 --> 2:47:28.520]  you know the rest of the commenters on the page have fun with it because instantly the moronic
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:35.560]  that's right the second we posted and and before they would try that alex is a fed alex is doing
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:40.040]  this alex is doing that all the same stuff they did to break up groups in the sixties that doesn't
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:45.880]  work anymore now they try saying first like i posted first to control the debate or they try to put
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:50.920]  nonsensical stuff or they talk about paladians and aliens and we can go in and look at the ip
[2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:56.920]  addresses they're using proxy server blockers they're using virtual browsers and but it's the
[2:47:56.920 --> 2:48:03.160]  same ip addresses and they'll have fake debates with each other which he talks about creating fake
[2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:11.000]  false contexts uh again they talk about being map makers of the mind setting the narrative again
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:17.640]  controlling the confines of the debate turning us all against each other radicalizing us so we're not
[2:48:17.640 --> 2:48:24.040]  palatable mainstream i mean it feels so good to be under mega attacked by these people paul no one
[2:48:24.040 --> 2:48:28.760]  in the web is attacked more than alex jones info wars dot com and prison planet dot com because we're
[2:48:28.760 --> 2:48:33.960]  number one alternative sites number one sites info wars number two site is prison planet dot com all
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:37.800]  these other fakes claim they're number one we are number one according to lexa and every other
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:43.560]  major gauge shout cast the list goes on and on and they're in a lot of trouble uh because they
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:50.680]  can't control the confines of the debate anymore paul exactly and then their tactics are increasingly
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:57.800]  getting more and more ludicrous one of my favorites is they'll go into an article and they'll just say
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:04.040]  this is a fake news story for example i posted a new york times story you know a few paragraphs from
[2:49:04.040 --> 2:49:08.760]  it with a link to the original where you can read it at the new york times about an eight-year-old
[2:49:08.760 --> 2:49:14.520]  boy being on a terror watch list and one of the comments that this seems like a fake news story
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:20.360]  and it's that's one of the tactics they use as well as it's ad exactly on youtube the same
[2:49:20.360 --> 2:49:25.320]  accounts set up the same ways we'll comment when we play a herman von rumpi clip head of the e u
[2:49:25.320 --> 2:49:30.760]  calling for global government i'll see the same person on hundreds of our videos working full
[2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:36.280]  time always the first comment they're waiting they're watching and they just say this is absolutely
[2:49:36.280 --> 2:49:41.400]  fake to then have a debate about whether it's real or not instead of people getting angry and
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:46.760]  getting informed and actually talking to each other and he admits that in here he says confound
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:52.600]  them claim it's not real throw things into confuse them i mean it is look at his smiling
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:58.440]  face paul he just is so proud of what he's done and that's what cointel pro was all about is about
[2:49:58.440 --> 2:50:05.320]  neutralizing people so they felt powerless and eventually you know stirring up apathy so people
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:13.800]  would just disengage altogether that that's what he's talking about in this um dossier about infiltrating
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:19.800]  conspiracy groups and promoting counter misinformation as he describes it so he's
[2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:25.720]  savaging people for putting out conspiracies that aren't true like you know sunlight being good for
[2:50:25.720 --> 2:50:31.640]  you but then he says that when the government does it it's fine and they can ban half free speech
[2:50:31.640 --> 2:50:38.040]  to go along with it well paul thanks for the great report we need more reports on the aspect of him
[2:50:38.040 --> 2:50:43.400]  saying we're going to ban free speech and tax newspapers or anybody that criticizes government
[2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:50.280]  and he sets the precedent at i say sunlight isn't good for you and if you don't agree you need to
[2:50:50.280 --> 2:50:56.680]  be banned or arrested he picks something asinine to kind of put people off psychologically so they
[2:50:56.680 --> 2:51:02.840]  can set the precedent to ban anything they want including two plus two equals four nope sunstein
[2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:09.960]  says it equals five for the first time ever the makers of alpine air foods have approved an

[2:54:21.400 --> 2:54:28.600]  rating services it's the biggest this is what the media most often refers to in the last seven days
[2:54:29.160 --> 2:54:37.160]  look at info wars dot com in blue versus rush limbaugh in red and glenn beck in gold now that's
[2:54:37.160 --> 2:54:48.520]  info wars dot com that's info wars dot com in blue up 43 46 percent growth in the last three months

[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:02.760]  the last week so again ladies and gentlemen that's our growth curve compared to rush limbaugh
[2:55:02.760 --> 2:55:09.400]  dot com in fact add prison planet dot com in there on the box let's put prison planet on the screen
[2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:15.640]  it's bigger than limbaugh and beck most weeks i don't know about this week but but info wars
[2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:21.880]  overall completely dominates and dwarfs them now we are the number one target of co until
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:26.520]  pro that's why they thrill everything at us they say i'm a reptoid they say i'm a jewish
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:31.480]  agent they say i work for the vatican when i'm a protestant uh they say i'm a murderer they say
[2:55:31.480 --> 2:55:36.520]  i work for the saudi arabians they say i work for the brothmans they say i'm a scientologist
[2:55:36.520 --> 2:55:45.160]  all complete and absolute fabricated lies but they're so elaborate and and some people see it
[2:55:45.160 --> 2:55:51.320]  and it's just meant to distract you from going out and reaching other people waking other people up
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:57.400]  and to make most of our activities about debating alex jones now it's great for alex jones and
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:02.760]  overall visitors and web numbers but it's not good for the overall movement did you get that

[2:56:48.440 --> 2:56:55.400]  drudge is now linked to us permanently look at drudge now that is mega power look at info wars
[2:56:55.400 --> 2:57:02.760]  way down there and way below us rush limbaugh and glenn back now that is internet power right there
[2:57:02.760 --> 2:57:07.000]  and what do you see on the drudge report every day now world government is here world government
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:12.440]  announced they aren't drudge isn't listening to the map makers of the mind the people that set the
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:18.840]  narrative set the paradigm like uh this uh sunstein this cast sunstein at the white house
[2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:24.360]  who says there is no global government and if you say it you should be arrested he actually says that
[2:57:26.040 --> 2:57:32.440]  well drudge goes okay i'll go ahead and link to the head of the u in the head of the eu gordon

[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:23.160]  daylights out of them i mean i can't help it when somebody tries to attack me i go after them
[3:03:23.160 --> 3:03:27.800]  and and that's how men always were a hundred years ago i'd just be an average person
[3:03:30.360 --> 3:03:38.680]  today i'm some kind of freak when some guy running the white house operation says arrest

[3:03:45.480 --> 3:03:50.760]  waking up they've gone too far they're going the white house says there's no global government but

[3:08:03.640 --> 3:08:12.280]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[3:08:19.240 --> 3:08:24.520]  when we get fema training documents and fema training videos of local police and i've released
[3:08:24.520 --> 3:08:30.280]  these this is on record and the cointel pro goes into those youtube videos and says this
[3:08:30.280 --> 3:08:35.080]  isn't real they said my mayac and homeland security report wasn't real they said my
[3:08:35.080 --> 3:08:39.400]  secret documents that we released about how we were really at a level six flu pandemic that the
[3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:44.280]  u n had already announced it internally they still say that isn't real even though it was later
[3:08:44.280 --> 3:08:50.120]  admitted that i was right again they know this is a real source of info that actually reads their
[3:08:50.120 --> 3:08:56.600]  documents for coming up on two decades been on air over 14 years but studying for 16 17 years
[3:08:56.600 --> 3:09:02.040]  they know that i actually have their number you know these guys study two three years to
[3:09:02.040 --> 3:09:09.400]  get their phd after their in propaganda and lies i have an organic super phd and how these
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:15.320]  criminals operate i mean i study them day in day out with passion to know how they operate
[3:09:15.320 --> 3:09:20.040]  and to watch a lot of you out there that aren't as sophisticated who are just as smart as i am or
[3:09:20.040 --> 3:09:24.840]  smarter but who haven't done the research they know you're waking up in droves and they want to
[3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:30.200]  turn you against other patriot movements they want to confuse you confound you demonize the real
[3:09:30.200 --> 3:09:38.760]  leadership when you see them demonizing people like ron paul myself and others you know it is
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:46.040]  a co-intel pro operation some of its jealousy but that's mainly repeaters mockingbirds that's why
[3:09:46.040 --> 3:09:51.480]  the cia called their media operation mockingbird in the 40s 50s 60s and 70s they got declassified
[3:09:51.480 --> 3:09:57.000]  in the church committee and others it's called mockingbird because they have key people in the
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:10:04.600]  media and back then it wasn't even that many just a few thousand who then would put out this info
[3:10:04.600 --> 3:10:09.560]  and then there were repeaters who would mockingbird it and that's how they get the snowball going
[3:10:10.680 --> 3:10:16.040]  it isn't even so much meant to hurt alex jones as to hurt you and your intellectual development
[3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:22.120]  and to keep you from ever becoming actually informed or effective kind of falling into the whole
[3:10:22.120 --> 3:10:29.320]  issue of no significance soap opera of is it the octarians or is it the green aliens or is it
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:37.480]  the jews or is it the catholics or is it you know the merovingians or is it the bagaboukians
[3:10:37.480 --> 3:10:43.720]  you know it just goes on and on and on and sure of the real groups i named every major power
[3:10:43.720 --> 3:10:48.840]  structure they've infiltrated and taken it over so all the the vaticans calling for world government
[3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:53.960]  a lot of the people in israel government is calling for world government europe's calling
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:58.120]  for world government mexico's calling for world government because they're all owned by the same
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:04.920]  big banks and so they can again divide and conquer by making any movement against tyranny
[3:11:04.920 --> 3:11:11.720]  issues specific so they can then divide people off against groups look different religions and
[3:11:11.720 --> 3:11:17.240]  races of people we can all kill each other later but right now we're trying to beat the new world
[3:11:17.240 --> 3:11:23.000]  order that's the big scientific dictatorship that uses human psychology against us again
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:28.440]  they've written literally thousands of white papers bragging how they do it in the 1920s
[3:11:28.440 --> 3:11:35.800]  edward bernay's the nethius sigmond freud the top department of war psych warfare expert i mean he's
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:40.760]  the guy that got women smoking cigarettes bacon and eggs everything you live under he wrote two
[3:11:40.760 --> 3:11:49.640]  books bragging how they do all this to you that was 80 years ago on and on and on and on all i'm
[3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:57.560]  asking you to do is to think for yourself get outside the box and get some discernment and then
[3:11:58.120 --> 3:12:04.120]  take action yourself you know you are good you know listening that you're not co until pro you're
[3:12:04.120 --> 3:12:08.840]  because that's how co until pro works so well is that once they cause all the infighting and
[3:12:08.840 --> 3:12:14.840]  division and problems then everyone spends their time on that and then you can expand your organizations
[3:12:14.840 --> 3:12:19.080]  because any folks i learned about co until pro i've read about it and heard about it but like
[3:12:19.080 --> 3:12:24.280]  in 96 97 there'd be some old veteran they were going to bulldoze's house and take it so we go
[3:12:24.280 --> 3:12:28.520]  over there to try to get the bulldozers to stop and help them with the community joe campana
[3:12:29.080 --> 3:12:34.760]  and and in plain clothes cops would walk on and say ah alex we need to kill some judges in austin
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:41.320]  we need to and i'd follow them out to their car and it'd be an unmarked police car and then i found
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:45.960]  out the local cops had been hired by the local realtors that wanted to steal that guy's property
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:53.160]  and it just you're like how do they hire people this evil and so they don't here's another great
[3:12:53.160 --> 3:13:00.040]  example of co until pro when i was in denver i said there were occasions that looked like during the
[3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:08.840]  dnc in 2008 year and a half ago i said there were occasions that it looked like it was police
[3:13:08.840 --> 3:13:13.720]  as anarchists attacking other cops and eyewitnesses said yeah we saw white van because we couldn't be
[3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:19.080]  everywhere there are protests going on everywhere white vans pulled up marines got out in uniforms
[3:13:19.640 --> 3:13:25.800]  and openly in the doors changed into anarchist outfit it later came out in the denver post
[3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:32.440]  that was all true it was all run by the pentagon they had fbi they had military same thing in
[3:13:32.440 --> 3:13:37.240]  seattle in 99 that came out in all the seattle papers it's in my film police day two the takeover
[3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:48.200]  and they had police attack other police in denver confirmed confirmed they did it in
[3:13:48.200 --> 3:13:52.920]  ottawa a year and a half ago royal amount of police got caught attacking their own police
[3:13:52.920 --> 3:13:58.040]  so they could then demonize the peaceful families in suits and ties and with strollers
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:14:02.920]  look the globalists see a couple thousand good looking families out there in front of the news
[3:14:02.920 --> 3:14:09.640]  cameras protesting the security prosperity partnership north american union and they
[3:14:09.640 --> 3:14:13.960]  immediately had cops come up and attack their own cops so they could attack the peaceful crowds
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:20.280]  and discredit those peaceful demonstrators that's an example of co until pro and that's what
[3:14:20.280 --> 3:14:25.720]  the white house technologies are that's what he's calling for the information
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:32.040]  regulatory affairs he's calling for coming into our offices into our operations into our
[3:14:32.040 --> 3:14:36.520]  political movements into our video and book store movements that are really hurting them
[3:14:36.520 --> 3:14:41.080]  because we're funding ourselves they don't like us getting a little bit of power because for one
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:45.720]  dollar that we get we can do the equivalent of a million dollars of what they do with lies
[3:14:45.720 --> 3:14:51.240]  one dollar of truth is better than a million dollars of lies lies have to be reapplied over
[3:14:51.240 --> 3:14:56.600]  and over again they they fall apart the truth gets stronger and stronger and stronger and
[3:14:56.600 --> 3:15:04.520]  stronger and builds and builds a dynamic system so think about the magnitude of what they've
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:09.800]  been caught and every time i go to a big city and see provocateurs i've seen it in austin
[3:15:09.800 --> 3:15:15.320]  we've seen it the g20 with my crew up there every time i sit there and watch the film or in person
[3:15:15.320 --> 3:15:21.320]  when i'm there and i go i can't believe they got their their cops to do it too i want to like the
[3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:26.120]  cops i want to think you're not criminals i i want to give you the benefit of the doubt but i know
[3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:33.560]  what's going on every city has groups of criminal cops and it's normally special units that's how
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:37.560]  they compartmentalize it so the average cop here in this goes we don't do stuff like that
[3:15:37.560 --> 3:15:44.840]  but who go out and do this type of stuff and it's so wrong it's so evil
[3:15:47.400 --> 3:15:55.400]  so ladies and gentlemen you know you're good you know you're a leader start a website start
[3:15:55.400 --> 3:16:02.120]  doing youtube video start calling to talk radio start a local organization you know a military
[3:16:02.120 --> 3:16:09.320]  history and enthusiast group you want to train militarily or a land rights group and i'll assure
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:13.240]  you you want to find out about the new world order don't be scared by this though go with five of
[3:16:13.240 --> 3:16:19.720]  your buddies say you're going to meet in two weeks at the local library and there will be one or two
[3:16:19.720 --> 3:16:27.560]  vicious foundation hired thugs or fbi informants or fbi or defense intelligence there and you'll
[3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:32.280]  just see them they're soulless they're slimy they don't have a spirit of strength or honor if you've
[3:16:32.280 --> 3:16:36.840]  got your discernment on you'll immediately know who they are as soon as you see them i mean i have
[3:16:36.840 --> 3:16:40.760]  freaked these people out at events when i've been protesting and they have a navy seal or something
[3:16:40.760 --> 3:16:45.000]  walk behind us and you can look at their body type the look on their eye the predatory stare that
[3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:51.640]  they're trying to hide and i'll go oh so you're here from uh north com i mean you're and they'll
[3:16:51.640 --> 3:16:57.080]  they'll whatever johnson and just kind of you know get on down i mean this has happened to me over
[3:16:57.080 --> 3:17:02.440]  and over and over again and they're always amazed that you immediately know them but if you sit there
[3:17:03.240 --> 3:17:07.160]  well what's everybody want to talk about well i they're taking this old lady's land and this farm
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:12.120]  and there's an environmental land grab going on through the local bank and it's agenda 21 i think
[3:17:12.120 --> 3:17:17.240]  we need to expose it we need to go to city council next week and one girl stand up and go i i think
[3:17:17.240 --> 3:17:24.760]  we ought to bomb them with a neutron bomb and and they'll act all animated and so the normal people
[3:17:24.760 --> 3:17:29.000]  there won't want to be involved and if there's any fool that even jokes and goes oh yeah you're
[3:17:29.000 --> 3:17:34.440]  going to prison but what you do is you have a recorder at that first meeting you go tell me more
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:39.640]  and then you follow them out to their car you photograph their car and you say i'm calling
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:46.360]  the police right now because if you just call the police without recording them they'll say you
[3:17:46.360 --> 3:17:49.960]  called for the violence and the cops will show up looking embarrassed and the uh
[3:17:49.960 --> 3:17:53.560]  guy'll kind of do a hand sound or whatever and the cop will be like what's going on here
[3:17:53.560 --> 3:17:57.080]  and you're going to be dealing with a hardcore terrorist these are government
[3:17:57.080 --> 3:18:02.680]  terrorists ladies and gentlemen i mean you can't help an old man in austin without him showing up
[3:18:02.680 --> 3:18:12.040]  okay you folks cointel pro declassified admitted that they infiltrate mainline pro war pro government
[3:18:12.040 --> 3:18:20.200]  churches if the church is actually having real soup kitchens they don't want anything that's
[3:18:20.200 --> 3:18:25.960]  community but government they don't want strong communities you actually try to help people with a
[3:18:25.960 --> 3:18:35.880]  real uh charity they will shut you down in 10 seconds but you steal every single dime of it
[3:18:35.880 --> 3:18:41.720]  and give political contributions they'll show up at your door and say we want to work with you robin
[3:18:41.720 --> 3:18:47.160]  people i mean it's just don't you understand millions of criminals have worked out all these
[3:18:47.160 --> 3:18:52.360]  fancy scams they're now in control of almost everything and and and they know there's a mass
[3:18:52.360 --> 3:18:58.520]  awakening to them right now so homeland security comes out in congressional testimony and says
[3:18:59.080 --> 3:19:03.400]  we're just going to ban free speech in america and put taxes on alternative newspapers
[3:19:03.400 --> 3:19:07.080]  and infiltrate their groups and commit all these crimes they're just out in the open
[3:19:07.080 --> 3:19:12.760]  because they have to come out in the open like it's normal to get their own spooks and their own
[3:19:12.760 --> 3:19:21.800]  informants and their own operatives to do it so again what does the cointel pro documents say
[3:19:23.480 --> 3:19:27.640]  courted fbi records cointel pro resources were expended on infiltrating

[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:45.880]  is a big deal this is why we can't ever organize marches or protest because you go and the cops
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:51.640]  attack their own people and then attack you the peaceful crowd and the news blames old women and
[3:24:51.640 --> 3:24:57.240]  women with uh with the baby carriages for what happened when it's the government i'll never
[3:24:57.240 --> 3:25:02.120]  forget five years ago seeing footage out of uh portland oregon that made me physically ill
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:07.800]  it was a few thousand peaceful people against the war and the police come out and surround them
[3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:12.680]  and no one does and the police say move back move back move back they are moving back
[3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:19.400]  and the cops walk right over and spray a baby in a in a carriage right in the face and the woman says
[3:25:19.400 --> 3:25:24.440]  and the baby's on the edge of dying having this pumped up their nose she says why did you do that
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:31.160]  to my baby and he says listening you effing bleeper you don't bring a baby to a protest and they just
[3:25:31.160 --> 3:25:36.760]  beat the daylights out of those people and guess what they never went out and protested again to
[3:25:36.760 --> 3:25:44.280]  where all that's left is 30 or 40 hired foundation thugs led by cops in anarchist outfits and a
[3:25:44.280 --> 3:25:49.480]  few methhead idiots that don't know it's a federal operation running around tumping over trash cans
[3:25:49.480 --> 3:25:55.160]  and lighting them on fire so then the police can come in and no one was resisting the police so then
[3:25:55.160 --> 3:25:59.720]  they started going and finding women coming out of stores with with grocery bags and police dogs
[3:25:59.720 --> 3:26:04.680]  attacking them because no one's allowed on the streets of pittsburgh and then going on the university
[3:26:04.680 --> 3:26:09.160]  at night and the college students are out at the park and they're like cops are marching up and they
[3:26:09.160 --> 3:26:14.680]  announce no one's allowed on the streets day or night of pittsburgh moved back they try to move
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:20.600]  back the police had surrounded them and they just run up to women on bikes running from them and just
[3:26:20.600 --> 3:26:27.080]  start beating them blood spewing as they just drive spikes in america's heart and it's all a psych
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:32.600]  warfare test of those police what will they do what will they go along with what will they accept

[3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:33.800]  story on record of what the star spangled banner really stands for and what those people did

[3:34:40.440 --> 3:34:47.560]  constitution the declaration of independence it symbolizes free humanity and if we had one
[3:34:47.560 --> 3:34:55.000]  ounce of what those men and women had then we would have never turned into this society but we
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:35:01.560]  became decadent we became wicked we bought into corruption we need to rediscover the
[3:35:01.560 --> 3:35:07.080]  founding documents and breathe life into it and that is starting to happen so here here is the
[3:35:07.080 --> 3:35:14.520]  true story of the star spangled banner our national anthem what it really stands for it's now been
[3:35:14.520 --> 3:35:19.880]  expropriated it's been taken by the media taken by the government used to sell their wars their
[3:35:19.880 --> 3:35:25.960]  lies their frauds when george washington said never invade another country don't get involved in

[3:36:08.200 --> 3:36:09.400]  what does it really stand for
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:15.240]  there was a lawyer once his name was francis scottie
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:20.920]  he penned a song that i'm sure you're aware of you've seen it it's in most hymnals throughout
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:28.680]  our churches it's called the national anthem it is our song as an american we go however to a ball
[3:36:28.680 --> 3:36:33.320]  game we stand in our church services and we sing the words of that song and they float over our
[3:36:33.320 --> 3:36:37.560]  minds in our lips and we don't even realize what we're singing most of us have memorized it as a
[3:36:37.560 --> 3:36:43.480]  child but we've never really thought about what it means let me tell you a story francis scottie
[3:36:43.480 --> 3:36:51.240]  was a lawyer in baltimore the colonies were engaged in vicious conflict with the mother
[3:36:51.240 --> 3:36:57.400]  country britain because of this conflict and the protractedness of it they had accumulated
[3:36:57.400 --> 3:37:01.880]  prisoners on both sides the american colonies had prisoners and the british had prisoners
[3:37:01.880 --> 3:37:05.800]  and the american government initiated a move they went to the british and they said let us
[3:37:05.800 --> 3:37:12.840]  negotiate for the release of these prisoners they said we want to send a man out to discuss
[3:37:12.840 --> 3:37:18.040]  this with you they were holding the american prisoners in boats about a thousand yards offshore
[3:37:18.680 --> 3:37:23.560]  and they said we want to send a man by the name of francis scottie he will come out and negotiate
[3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:29.160]  to see if we can make a mutual exchange on the appointed day in a row boat he went out to this
[3:37:29.160 --> 3:37:34.360]  boat and he negotiated with the british officials and they reached a conclusion that men could be
[3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:40.920]  exchanged on a one-for-one basis francis scottie jubilant with the fact that he'd been successful
[3:37:40.920 --> 3:37:47.960]  went down below in the boats and what he found was a cargo hold full of humanity men and he said
[3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:54.840]  men i've got news for you tonight you're free he said tonight i have negotiated successfully
[3:37:54.840 --> 3:37:59.080]  your return to the colonies he said you'll be taken out of this boat out of this filth out of
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:05.400]  your chains as he went back up on board to arrange for their passage to the shore the admiral came
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:11.000]  and he said we have a slight problem he said we will still honor our commitment to release these
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:18.280]  men but it'll be merely academic after tonight it won't matter and francis scottie said what do you
[3:38:18.280 --> 3:38:28.600]  mean he said well mr. key he said tonight we have laid an ultimatum upon the colonies your people
[3:38:28.600 --> 3:38:34.600]  will either capitulate and lay down the colors of that flag that you think so much of or you see
[3:38:34.600 --> 3:38:39.880]  that fort right over there fort henry he said we're gonna remove it from the face of the earth
[3:38:41.320 --> 3:38:47.240]  he said how are you gonna do that he said if you will scan the horizon of the sea and as he looked
[3:38:48.200 --> 3:38:54.520]  he could see hundreds of little dots and he said that's the entire british war fleet
[3:38:55.960 --> 3:39:00.760]  he said all of the gun power all of the armament is being called upon to demolish that fort
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:06.840]  it will be here within striking distance in a matter of about two and a half hours he said the
[3:39:06.840 --> 3:39:14.440]  war is over these men would be free anyway he said you can't show that fort he said that's
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:19.960]  that's a large fort he said it's full of women and children he says it's predominantly not a military
[3:39:19.960 --> 3:39:26.920]  fort they said don't worry about it they said we've left them a way out and he said what's that
[3:39:26.920 --> 3:39:35.640]  he said do you see that flag way up on the rampart he said we have told them that if they will lower
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:43.320]  that flag the shelling will stop immediately and we'll know that they've surrendered and you'll
[3:39:43.320 --> 3:39:51.480]  now be under british rule francis got he went down below and told the men what was about to happen
[3:39:51.480 --> 3:39:59.880]  and they said how many ships he said hundreds the ships got closer francis got he went back
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:07.320]  up on top and he said men i'll shout down to you what's going on as we watch as twilight began to
[3:40:07.320 --> 3:40:14.680]  fall and as the haze hung over the ocean as it does at sunset suddenly the british war fleet
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:23.240]  unleashed he says the sound was deafening there were so many guns that there were no reliefs
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:28.360]  he said it was absolutely impossible to talk or hear he said suddenly the sky although dark
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:35.000]  was suddenly lit and he says from down below all he could hear the men the prisoners saying was
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:45.240]  tell us where the flag is what have they done with the flag is the flag still flying over the
[3:40:45.240 --> 3:40:56.280]  rampart tell us one hour two hours three hours into the shelling every time the bomb would
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:41:01.800]  explode and it would be close to the flag they could see the flag in the illuminated red glare
[3:41:01.800 --> 3:41:09.400]  of that bomb and francis got he would report down to the men below it's still up it's not down
[3:41:13.480 --> 3:41:17.320]  the admiral came and he said your people are insane he said what's the matter with them
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:22.680]  he said don't they understand this is an impossible situation
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:29.560]  francis got he said he remembered what george washington have said he said the thing that sets
[3:41:29.560 --> 3:41:36.280]  the american christian apart from all other people in the world is he will die on his feet before
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:46.600]  he'll live on his knees the admiral said we have now instructed all of the guns to focus on the
[3:41:46.600 --> 3:41:53.320]  rampart to take that flag down he said we don't understand something our reconnaissance tells us
[3:41:53.320 --> 3:41:58.280]  that that flag has been hit directly again and again and again and yet it's still flying we
[3:41:58.280 --> 3:42:05.640]  don't understand that but he said now we're about to bring every gun for the next three hours to
[3:42:05.640 --> 3:42:13.800]  bear on that point francis got he said the barrage was unmerciful all that he could hear
[3:42:16.280 --> 3:42:18.760]  was the men down below praying
[3:42:18.760 --> 3:42:28.360]  the prayer god keep that flag flying where we last saw it
[3:42:32.360 --> 3:42:39.160]  sunrise came he said there was a heavy mist hanging over the land but the rampart was tall
[3:42:39.160 --> 3:42:48.680]  enough there stood the flag completely nondescript in shreds the flag pulled itself was in a crazy
[3:42:48.680 --> 3:42:59.080]  angle but the flag was still at the top francis got key went aboard and immediately went into
[3:42:59.080 --> 3:43:06.920]  fort henry to see what had happened and what he found it happened was that that flag pulled
[3:43:06.920 --> 3:43:20.520]  and that flag had suffered repetitious direct hits and when hit had fallen but men fathers who knew
[3:43:20.520 --> 3:43:29.400]  what it meant for that flag to be on the ground although knowing that all of the british guns
[3:43:29.400 --> 3:43:37.160]  were trained on it walked over and held it up humanly until they died
[3:43:39.800 --> 3:43:47.400]  their bodies were removed and others took their place francis got key said what held that flag
[3:43:47.400 --> 3:43:59.640]  fold in place at that unusual angle were patriots bodies he penned the song oh say can you see by
[3:43:59.640 --> 3:44:07.720]  the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
[3:44:07.720 --> 3:44:18.120]  or the rocket's red glare the bombs bursting in air gave proof through the night that the
[3:44:18.120 --> 3:44:32.680]  flag was still there oh say does that star-spangled banner yet fly and wave or the land of the
[3:44:32.680 --> 3:44:43.400]  free and the home of the brave the debt was demanded the price it was paid
[3:44:45.560 --> 3:44:51.000]  all right folks now look at what our country's turned into now a operations base for criminal
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:57.320]  offshore banks to export tyranny worldwide and enslave us here at home with government co and
[3:44:57.320 --> 3:45:03.160]  tell pro saying that if you don't want socialist health care you're a racist that's co and tell pro
[3:45:03.160 --> 3:45:08.520]  playing that against people creating racial division infiltrating groups trying to radicalize
[3:45:08.520 --> 3:45:13.240]  them trying to get people to commit acts of violence so they can put them in prison openly
[3:45:13.240 --> 3:45:18.680]  saying they want to restrict our free speech that our forefathers fought and died for this is
[3:45:18.680 --> 3:45:25.640]  outrageous we the patriots the constitutionalist we're the good guys we're trying to save the
[3:45:25.640 --> 3:45:30.520]  republic and anybody that stands against that anybody that calls for abolishing the bill of
[3:45:30.520 --> 3:45:37.640]  rights which they're doing right now is a treasonous traitorous larcenist enemy of humanity period
[3:45:39.320 --> 3:45:47.240]  period now here is steve voss and his rendition of the star-spangled banner now that you know
[3:45:47.240 --> 3:45:53.000]  what it really stands for and that's why with co and tell pro they've demonized our country's history
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:45:57.800]  so they could replace it with a new world order that's why they hate our founders here it is
[3:46:05.320 --> 3:46:06.120]  oh
[3:46:06.120 --> 3:46:30.840]  say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last
[3:46:30.840 --> 3:46:45.560]  gleaming whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
[3:46:45.560 --> 3:47:00.280]  for the red parts we watched were so gallantly streaming
[3:47:00.280 --> 3:47:21.000]  and the rocket's red glare the bombs bursting in air gave full through the night
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:41.720]  that our flag was still there oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
[3:47:41.720 --> 3:47:57.960]  away for the land of the free and the home of the brave
[3:47:57.960 --> 3:48:12.680]  oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:32.920]  away for the land of the free and the home of the brave
[3:48:32.920 --> 3:48:43.080]  the globalist don't teach in schools or anywhere else why the star-spangled banner is so important
[3:48:44.280 --> 3:48:49.640]  what we saw the type of valiant activity at the alamo was the tail end of the true flower
[3:48:49.640 --> 3:48:54.520]  of our republic but it can bloom again and i want you guys to cue it up to the front of
[3:48:54.520 --> 3:48:58.840]  that video the start of the video we played with the george washington quote i want to
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:05.240]  read that here on air for people to understand what the cost are and where we came from and what
[3:49:05.240 --> 3:49:12.760]  we are and our responsibility to turn this around and to fix it i have fema on video
[3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:19.000]  calling george washington an evil terrorist this is an alien evil group of corrupt people
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:26.600]  that hate our country that are in control of this nation and it's our right and our responsibility
[3:49:26.600 --> 3:49:30.840]  is the declaration of independent states to stand against them and to speak out against them and to
[3:49:30.840 --> 3:49:36.520]  expose them for the illegitimate criminals they are they're doing everything they can to demonize
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:42.120]  the american people right now to demonize true americanism true freedom but it's not going to
[3:49:42.120 --> 3:49:49.160]  work it's not going to happen the spirit of freedom is rising do you guys find that george
[3:49:49.160 --> 3:49:53.720]  washington quote i want to put it up on screen for people and i want to read it here on air before
[3:49:53.720 --> 3:50:02.200]  we uh before we go to break because because george washington boiled it all down
[3:50:04.280 --> 3:50:07.880]  why this nation was able to be founded why we were able to persevere
[3:50:10.600 --> 3:50:15.240]  and so i say to everybody out there if you didn't know why the star spangle banner is so special
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:21.560]  that's another example of how you've been robbed of your true history and who you really are
[3:50:21.560 --> 3:50:27.080]  and it's in rediscovering who we really are that we can defeat this new world order
[3:50:28.760 --> 3:50:31.240]  and that's the bottom line ladies and gentlemen
[3:50:35.160 --> 3:50:38.920]  the thing that sets the american christian apart from all other people in the world
[3:50:39.480 --> 3:50:47.480]  is he will die on his feet before he will live on his knees george washington again the thing that sets
[3:50:47.480 --> 3:50:53.560]  the american christian apart from all other people in the world is that he will die on his feet before
[3:50:53.560 --> 3:51:00.600]  he will live on his knees and that's what you saw from the true story of the star spangled banner
[3:51:01.480 --> 3:51:02.920]  we'll be right back stay with us

[3:53:08.360 --> 3:53:13.320]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know
[3:53:13.320 --> 3:53:18.280]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[3:53:18.280 --> 3:53:22.360]  seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[3:53:22.360 --> 3:53:27.160]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[3:53:27.160 --> 3:53:33.800]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[3:53:33.800 --> 3:53:38.280]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[3:53:38.280 --> 3:53:44.040]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit

[3:55:04.040 --> 3:55:12.600]  republican party affiliation doesn't matter at the end of the day if you die i've had top genetic
[3:55:12.600 --> 3:55:17.160]  engineers on who are making millions of dollars and we're happy and then they would come back and say
[3:55:17.160 --> 3:55:23.560]  half the rats we feed this corner potato to are dying it's causing birth defects in all the baby
[3:55:23.560 --> 3:55:30.200]  mice there's different varieties i'm talking about and every major gmo crop has been proven in the
[3:55:30.200 --> 3:55:35.160]  studies done by the companies they know what it's doing and it always attacks fertility it's being
[3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:40.440]  done by design and if it's a byproduct that half the honeybees die because they eat the pollen of
[3:55:40.440 --> 3:55:47.000]  it so be it put that back on screen guys monsanto gmo corn linked to organ failure study reveals
[3:55:47.960 --> 3:55:52.680]  i mean ladies and gentlemen i see all the numbers of crones disease and organ failure and all these
[3:55:52.680 --> 3:55:58.360]  blood cancers they're all up a couple thousand percentage points on average i mean i mean i know
[3:55:59.480 --> 3:56:04.200]  everybody i know in the office has had a girlfriend at 25 almost die or die of cancer
[3:56:04.200 --> 3:56:11.320]  or or their you know their 30 year old brother dying of crones and the news is saying melamine
[3:56:11.320 --> 3:56:16.600]  and milk is good for you now and mercury is good for you and and sunlight's bad for you i mean
[3:56:16.600 --> 3:56:25.880]  these people are out of their minds they're just practicing insanity monsanto gmo corn linked to
[3:56:25.880 --> 3:56:31.560]  organ failure study reveals i wanted to cover this last what's your reaction in a study released by
[3:56:31.560 --> 3:56:37.640]  the international journal of biological sciences there's no more prestigious analyzing the effects
[3:56:37.640 --> 3:56:43.240]  of genetically modified foods on mammalian that's mammals that's us research found that agricultural
[3:56:43.240 --> 3:56:49.480]  giant monsanto gm and corn is linked to organ damage and rats according to the study which was
[3:56:49.480 --> 3:56:58.200]  summarized by the randy uh at at fort freedom three varieties of monsanto gm corn mon eight
[3:56:58.200 --> 3:57:05.480]  six three insecticide producing mon eight one zero and roundup herbicide absorbing nk 603
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:09.320]  were approved for consumption by the us european and several other national food safety authorities
[3:57:09.320 --> 3:57:16.360]  because they own the government and then it goes into the major studies showing that effects were
[3:57:16.360 --> 3:57:22.200]  mostly concentrated in the kidney and liver function the two major diet detoxification organs
[3:57:22.200 --> 3:57:27.640]  in the detail differed for each gm type and then it goes into the massive statistic damage
[3:57:27.640 --> 3:57:33.880]  to the organs folks this is the same corn variety that when the bees eat it eat the pollen
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:41.640]  they go die why monsanto said well we'll make it five thousand times stronger this naturally
[3:57:41.640 --> 3:57:47.800]  occurring pesticide that's in corn we'll make it develop it inside the corn depending on the
[3:57:47.800 --> 3:57:58.120]  variety a thousand to five thousand times the level and then you eat a pesticide it's a fungus
