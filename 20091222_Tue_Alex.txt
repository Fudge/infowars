[00:56.800 --> 01:01.920]  chance to see this in its entirety I'd seen pieces of it as a consultant as you
[01:01.920 --> 01:06.440]  can see in the credits for the true TV television show it's the highest rated
[01:06.440 --> 01:12.000]  new show they've ever had and it held its ratings which they never do very very
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.000]  rare usually a premiere has the highest ratings or a season finale but it's
[01:18.000 --> 01:25.200]  holding at record ratings for true TV and very very exciting jesse ventura I

[03:16.880 --> 03:21.360]  is the consummate insider he was there at the beginning at the embryonic
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.040]  formation of this phony environmental movement that intends to take over the
[03:26.040 --> 03:30.840]  entire planet's resources and set up a form of tyranny so you're telling me
[03:30.840 --> 03:35.560]  that George Hunt is the key he can put the jigsaw puzzle together on this whole
[03:35.560 --> 03:40.840]  global warming thing he's our man on the inside and you can set up this meeting

[04:23.960 --> 04:31.600]  global warming scare and a plot to rule the world their aims are to create an
[04:31.600 --> 04:37.240]  anxiety about the ecology and global warming and so on they're going to use
[04:37.240 --> 04:44.000]  it to take over the world and my right Maury's ladies and gentlemen this is
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.920]  groundbreaking nothing like this has ever aired on television I was talking to
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.000]  one of the producers of it and they can't believe that it's being allowed to
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.960]  be aired this is groundbreaking Lord Christopher Monkton was also in this
[04:56.960 --> 05:03.080]  global warming special he's live with us from Copenhagen hi folks this is Alex
[05:03.080 --> 05:06.520]  Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can
[05:06.520 --> 05:10.760]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[05:10.760 --> 05:14.920]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the
[05:14.920 --> 05:18.320]  respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[05:18.320 --> 05:23.040]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[05:23.040 --> 05:28.080]  yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano
[05:28.080 --> 05:32.440]  particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[05:32.440 --> 05:36.680]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[05:36.680 --> 05:41.440]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[05:41.440 --> 05:46.240]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[05:46.240 --> 05:51.880]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[05:51.880 --> 05:57.960]  the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[05:57.960 --> 06:05.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[06:05.320 --> 06:09.880]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[06:09.880 --> 06:13.640]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[06:13.640 --> 06:18.880]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[06:18.880 --> 06:24.160]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.200]  attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[06:28.200 --> 06:33.400]  criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[06:37.440 --> 06:41.120]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[06:41.120 --> 06:46.200]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[08:13.000 --> 08:20.440]  well I am really shaken by how powerful Jesse Ventura's global warming
[08:20.440 --> 08:27.680]  special was on truth TV top ratings the top show they've got on the channel that
[08:27.680 --> 08:32.000]  they start out with an open mind and conclude by the end that it's a global
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.960]  government fraud they get Ben santa to admit that he altered UN documents see
[08:37.960 --> 08:43.120]  climate gate is only the latest in what Lord Moncton and others for over a decade
[08:43.120 --> 08:49.600]  of an exposing systematic fraud and I just can't believe they allowed this to
[08:49.600 --> 08:55.360]  air I was talking to Michael Braverman who is the producer of the show
[08:55.360 --> 08:59.480]  Jesse Ventura's manager last night he called me and he said I can't believe
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.360]  they're allowing us to air this I can't believe that they let us come out with
[09:03.360 --> 09:09.200]  the 9-11 information with the harp information now this but it shows that
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.960]  the there's a major power struggle going on right now and a lot of people in the
[09:13.960 --> 09:18.400]  establishment don't want to go into this world dictatorship so major
[09:18.400 --> 09:24.880]  shake-ups happening right now but I am stunned that this aired Lord Christopher
[09:24.880 --> 09:31.560]  Moncton is a big part of the hour-long special he hasn't seen it yet but he
[09:31.560 --> 09:37.800]  joins us for the rest of the hour from Copenhagen Denmark now into week number
[09:37.800 --> 09:44.240]  two Obama and others to speak tomorrow the big grand finale it ends early next
[09:44.240 --> 09:50.600]  week and so joining us from Copenhagen to give us a report on the state of this
[09:50.600 --> 09:54.680]  global government establishment declaration of tyranny it looks like
[09:54.680 --> 09:57.840]  it's in trouble but he's the real expert and is on the ground it can tell us
[09:57.840 --> 10:02.440]  that and what their strategy what their plan be is going to be I have a good
[10:02.440 --> 10:07.400]  idea but I want to get it directly from Christopher Moncton sir thank you so
[10:07.400 --> 10:12.640]  much for joining us well it's a real pleasure to be with you again thank you
[10:12.640 --> 10:16.120]  you're there I'll give us your report on what you've witnessed in the last week
[10:16.120 --> 10:24.000]  and a half and the state of this event well the first thing is it's been very
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.960]  like a Nuremberg rally the people who come to these things are very nearly all
[10:28.960 --> 10:35.320]  of one mind only as a very senior senator from Australia said to me today
[10:35.320 --> 10:39.280]  this morning as we were trying to get into the conference and neither he a
[10:39.280 --> 10:44.040]  senator from the Australia nor nor I you know a member of the House of Lords in
[10:44.040 --> 10:48.000]  Britain nor be it without a seat or a vote neither of us could get into the
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.600]  conference today because they were excluding everybody except the delegates
[10:53.600 --> 10:59.160]  and the tiny tiny token handful of outside observers and we whom they had on
[10:59.160 --> 11:02.440]  on their blacklist because we disagreed with what they're trying to do there
[11:02.440 --> 11:08.560]  we're not allowed in but what has been going on over the last 10 days is they've
[11:08.560 --> 11:14.040]  been trying to see whether they can get a binding treaty and more or less at the
[11:14.040 --> 11:18.280]  outset they realized they would have to abandon that because it would never pass
[11:18.280 --> 11:22.720]  the US Senate if they call it a treaty it requires two thirds of the US Senate
[11:22.720 --> 11:26.440]  to vote for it and there are just too many blue dog Democrats as well as
[11:26.440 --> 11:31.000]  sensible Republicans who will not vote for the destruction of the US
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.360]  Constitution for the establishment of a world government for the bankrupting of
[11:35.360 --> 11:39.160]  the United States for the destruction of working people's jobs right across the
[11:39.160 --> 11:43.360]  industries of the US all of which will become unprofitable if anything like the
[11:43.360 --> 11:47.360]  original draft treaty had had gone through the word government has now
[11:47.360 --> 11:52.880]  been dropped from the treaty unfortunately all of the principles of all of
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.400]  the structure the democratic structures I say undemocratic such as I should say
[11:57.400 --> 12:03.520]  of bureaucracy that they're going to put in place these 700 separate new
[12:03.520 --> 12:07.840]  bureaucracies all interlocking with the secretariat of the conference of the
[12:07.840 --> 12:11.440]  states parties to the United Nations framework convention on climate change
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.720]  these are the new entities they're going to bring into being to create this world
[12:16.720 --> 12:23.920]  government those are still in the draft and Ban Ki-moon is clearly expecting
[12:23.920 --> 12:27.880]  he's the head of the UN he's clearly expecting that part of the treaty to go
[12:27.880 --> 12:31.960]  through because he is saying we're going to have to set up a structure of
[12:31.960 --> 12:36.400]  global government just to handle get this is actually what he admitted yesterday
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.640]  the enormous amounts of money which we are going to be getting from the
[12:40.640 --> 12:45.480]  countries of the West once this agreement goes through at Copenhagen so
[12:45.480 --> 12:50.880]  they are expecting to get this through so all the reports you see about how the
[12:50.880 --> 12:55.320]  parties are fatally deadlocked China has walked out the African countries have
[12:55.320 --> 12:58.840]  walked out everybody's complaining of the Danish government handling of it the
[12:58.840 --> 13:02.640]  Danish government says that he could no longer broker an agreement all of these
[13:02.640 --> 13:08.960]  things are the traditional window dressing to try to disarm those of us
[13:08.960 --> 13:13.280]  who don't want any of this to succeed because we would rather like to preserve
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.840]  so they're playing dead they're playing possum they're they're acting like they've
[13:17.840 --> 13:23.360]  been defeated but but but you're giving us the dreadful news Lord Christopher
[13:23.360 --> 13:28.600]  Moncton is that you believe they will sign this agreement that really is a
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.280]  treaty but on the surface isn't and then it will be enforced through the
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.520]  bureaucracy I mean that's what Obama has promised he has said to Congress last
[13:37.520 --> 13:44.040]  week quote we will use command and control and circumvent the legislature
[13:44.040 --> 13:50.560]  the parliamentary system setting up a EU style dictatorship through the
[13:50.560 --> 13:56.080]  bureaucracy if he tries to do that he will be impeached the great thing about
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.160]  the United States Constitution is that it does not allow the president to rule
[14:00.160 --> 14:05.880]  on his own it's very clear that there are three branches of the legislature
[14:05.880 --> 14:10.080]  there are the two houses of Congress and there is the executive branch the
[14:10.080 --> 14:16.040]  the president and his cabinet and he cannot rule on his own if he tries he
[14:16.040 --> 14:22.160]  will be impeached in fact already there are those in the Republican camp who are
[14:22.160 --> 14:25.160]  beginning to look at the constitutional implications of some of the things the
[14:25.160 --> 14:29.840]  president has been saying he had better trade very carefully at the or he will
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.440]  be out of office and in prison before he does there are constitutional constraints
[14:34.440 --> 14:40.200]  which thanks God may yet save not only America but the rest of the world from
[14:40.200 --> 14:45.400]  what you might be described as a tyranny that is what they had intended and it was
[14:45.400 --> 14:50.880]  I who first revealed it when I got the first draft of this drenful treaty and
[14:50.880 --> 14:56.000]  revealed its contents for the world in a speech in Minnesota which has now been
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.080]  seen by four million people on YouTube and there's no doubt that this has
[15:01.080 --> 15:06.760]  woken people up to what is really intended here and yes some more is strong
[15:06.760 --> 15:11.200]  whom you mentioned in your introduction he said 25 years ago that he was
[15:11.200 --> 15:15.960]  intending to turn the United Nations into governmental panel on climate change
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.840]  into a world government for that end he didn't set it up as a scientific body
[15:20.840 --> 15:25.720]  but as a political body that was his original intention and he has stuck to
[15:25.720 --> 15:29.480]  that throughout you also mentioned Ben Santa who's various
[15:29.480 --> 15:35.120]  fraudulent attempt to tamper with the scientific reports of the UN I have
[15:35.120 --> 15:43.280]  been exposing over the years it was Santa who on his own rewrote the 1995 UN
[15:43.280 --> 15:48.080]  report on the climate which had been submitted by you know a thousand
[15:48.080 --> 15:52.240]  scientists they'd agreed the tech the bureaucrats were furious but the
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.000]  scientists have said there is no indication of any human influence on
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.840]  global temperatures they said it five times they said it clearly they said we
[16:01.840 --> 16:05.720]  don't know when such an effect will ever be the son of Lord Monkton for those
[16:05.720 --> 16:10.440]  that don't know go back in the Jesse Ventura special but but but for years
[16:10.440 --> 16:16.160]  you've been exposing Ben Santa tell people who he is at the UN the direct
[16:16.160 --> 16:21.480]  deputy the minion of Maury strong people that don't know who Maury's strong is
[16:21.480 --> 16:28.320]  and he's now in this TV show Ben Santa admitting that he did excise that out so
[16:28.320 --> 16:33.520]  another huge climate gate I mean what is new to the public is new this may be
[16:33.520 --> 16:36.880]  old news to people who've been researching it like you but this is a whole
[16:36.880 --> 16:44.000]  another climate gate directly from the UN where they're engaged in fraud that
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.720]  is exactly it what we have clearly got here in this 1995 episode which the
[16:48.720 --> 16:52.440]  John Horford who was chairman of the UN at the time of the climate panel at the
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.240]  time tried to deny had ever happened he said he was unaware of any rewriting he
[16:57.240 --> 17:03.360]  in fact means perfectly well that this had been done because he and others at
[17:03.360 --> 17:08.040]  the UN have later said over this was entirely within the UN procedure one
[17:08.040 --> 17:13.800]  man could rewrite the UN's report and say exactly the opposite of what the
[17:13.800 --> 17:17.840]  scientists said because that was what the bureaucrats wanted they didn't want
[17:17.840 --> 17:21.760]  the scientists say there wasn't a problem otherwise this UN climate panel
[17:21.760 --> 17:25.400]  would be closed down and there'd be no world government so they got it to read
[17:25.400 --> 17:29.880]  that they got Santa to rewrite it and he's now admitted on television but
[17:29.880 --> 17:33.960]  that is what he did I believe it's the first time he has admitted it but I had
[17:33.960 --> 17:38.360]  the proof long ago that he's done this I've been saying so in fact I I've done
[17:38.360 --> 17:44.280]  a tour of European Parliament in which I have revealed exactly which bits of the
[17:44.280 --> 17:50.960]  1995 report he did rewrite and so now it is much better known than it was but
[17:50.960 --> 17:54.720]  this had gone on and of course he is one of the climate gate emailers he's
[17:54.720 --> 18:00.080]  intimately connected with the people who fraudulently abolished the medieval
[18:00.080 --> 18:06.120]  war period in the UN next report after 1995 which was in 2001 they had to
[18:06.120 --> 18:10.800]  abolish that because while it was plainly warmer in the medieval war period
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.200]  than today they couldn't play as any exception about today's temperature the
[18:15.200 --> 18:20.360]  1990 UN report had shown a graph showing that the medieval war period was one or
[18:20.360 --> 18:24.520]  two degrees Celsius warmer than today that's three or four Fahrenheit and they
[18:24.520 --> 18:29.600]  by 2001 they'd swept that away it's the same team connected to Ben Santa by
[18:29.600 --> 18:34.960]  these emails at climate case who had done that and then in the 2007 report they
[18:34.960 --> 18:40.360]  produced a bogus graph pretending that the rate of increase in temperatures over
[18:40.360 --> 18:46.560]  the past 150 years has itself been accelerating ever more rapidly as you
[18:46.560 --> 18:51.360]  come closer to the present now that graph was bogus and it was in fact fraudulent
[18:51.360 --> 18:58.520]  and and I saw Rajendra Pachari the chairman of the IPCC at a lecture at the
[18:58.520 --> 19:04.400]  University of Copenhagen two nights ago using that bogus graph which he knew was
[19:04.400 --> 19:10.640]  bogus and so I stood up at the end of his lecture and I gave him a letter which I
[19:10.640 --> 19:15.360]  had written to him explaining why this graph was bogus and I said to him this
[19:15.360 --> 19:21.120]  graph is a fraud you are participating in a fraud by using material of this kind
[19:21.120 --> 19:25.160]  which has long been discredited and the fact that you're still using it as an
[19:25.160 --> 19:30.080]  extremely serious matter and he was very upset and he said oh but you know to use the
[19:30.080 --> 19:36.000]  word fraud that's very unparalleled but he had absolutely no way of answering the
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.320]  point I had made. Lord Christopher Monckton is our guest I want to in layman's
[19:41.320 --> 19:48.200]  terms sir go over the state of the attempted world government at getting

[22:19.360 --> 22:23.760]  us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions

[24:00.560 --> 24:06.520]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[24:06.520 --> 24:12.880]  because there's a war on for your mind. I was talking to Lord Moncton during the
[24:12.880 --> 24:15.920]  break about some of the things I want to cover in the time we have left with him
[24:15.920 --> 24:21.040]  in the shower. How they're trying to implement this global government take
[24:21.040 --> 24:24.840]  over by stealth right now. Schwarzenegger says they're gonna take over
[24:24.840 --> 24:29.760]  county, cities, and states that's already going on. But then I said I also want to
[24:29.760 --> 24:34.720]  talk about how I keep seeing UN police assault or grab reporters that ask
[24:34.720 --> 24:40.400]  questions, even accredited reporters. And live on Fox News, the maker of Al Gore,
[24:40.400 --> 24:44.200]  not evil just wrong, which is really a whitewash, by the way. He is pure evil.
[24:44.200 --> 24:48.960]  He's a fraud. He knows what he's a would-be slave master. That guy got
[24:48.960 --> 24:53.840]  hit in the head by a bottle. I mean, they are really attacking people. And Lord
[24:53.840 --> 24:57.640]  Moncton told me he was assaulted by a police officer, knocked to the ground,
[24:57.640 --> 25:04.200]  and had to have the attention of a medic. So Lord Moncton, you described it. I had
[25:04.200 --> 25:09.240]  to, luckily, I brought up the point of the assaults of people that don't follow
[25:09.240 --> 25:15.760]  the new Hitlerian religion. But tell us what happened to yourself and others.
[25:15.760 --> 25:21.800]  Well, I was with Genesis B Fielding from Australia and other members of the
[25:21.800 --> 25:25.840]  group from the Committee for Constructive Tomorrow, which is a
[25:25.840 --> 25:31.480]  sensible environmental pressure group. And we were all accredited members of
[25:31.480 --> 25:36.360]  this conference. We were entitled to go into the conference. However, yesterday and
[25:36.360 --> 25:42.240]  again today, we were turned away by the UN on the flimidious ground, because
[25:42.240 --> 25:47.560]  there have been a demonstration by members of other non-governmental
[25:47.560 --> 25:52.080]  organizations totally unconnected with us. Demonstrations, in fact, are completely
[25:52.080 --> 25:55.920]  opposite direction from us, but they therefore decided they would exclude
[25:55.920 --> 26:00.440]  everyone, even those whom they had invited, as they had asked, and accredited to
[26:00.440 --> 26:05.640]  this conference. So when it was plain that we weren't going to be allowed in, the
[26:05.640 --> 26:10.200]  police said, would you please leave? And they began manhandling. So I said, I put
[26:10.200 --> 26:14.360]  my hands in my pocket. First thing you should do, I was trained in this by the
[26:14.360 --> 26:19.560]  John Ambulance years ago, if the police start to get cratchy, as they do. This is
[26:19.560 --> 26:23.640]  the Danish police under orders from the UN. That's the way it works. This new
[26:23.640 --> 26:28.880]  world government is already taking shape. They manhandled me physically, and I said,
[26:28.880 --> 26:34.000]  you will take your hands off me. And they then did. And the policeman said, you know,
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.920]  you're a very unpleasant man. I said, no, I'm just not used to being manhandled.
[26:37.920 --> 26:43.320]  And please don't do it. And I went where he wanted me to go, turned my back on him,
[26:43.320 --> 26:49.640]  and began to walk away. And he hit me very hard from behind, knocking me to the
[26:49.640 --> 26:55.640]  ground and knocking me out. Excuse me, excuse me, sir, a member of the House of
[26:55.640 --> 27:02.040]  Lords, the third Viscount of Moncton and Wrenchley, and you're being assaulted by
[27:02.040 --> 27:09.440]  UN-controlled thugs attacked from behind. Again, no one is safe from this
[27:09.440 --> 27:15.920]  tyranny. No, that's right. It was a very disfiguring episode. And I had done
[27:15.920 --> 27:20.080]  nothing to provoke this, except to say, please don't manhandle me. There was no
[27:20.080 --> 27:24.200]  need for that. We were on our way. So he knocked you out. I mean, you were knocked
[27:24.200 --> 27:29.160]  unconscious. Then apparently, I'm told, because I was then out for, I don't know, I
[27:29.160 --> 27:32.560]  don't know how long I was out for. But anyway, when I came around, there were lots of
[27:32.560 --> 27:37.160]  concerned faces standing around. And apparently, while I'd been knocked out, so
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.280]  my friends who were around me, one of them kindly cradling my head to stop it
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.080]  being banging on the ground again, they were saying, oh yes, he's just making it
[27:45.080 --> 27:50.120]  up, he's just faking it. Anyway, the kindly, the excellent equivalent of John
[27:50.120 --> 27:56.880]  Ambulance, the Danish volunteer Ambulance then, came and took me away and looked
[27:56.880 --> 28:00.600]  after me and their ambulance for 20 minutes and put a blanket on me and warmed
[28:00.600 --> 28:04.640]  me up and gave me some water to drink and checked my pulse and made sure I was
[28:04.640 --> 28:09.040]  coherent and all right again. They were very, very good. And I made a weak
[28:09.040 --> 28:14.120]  donation to their fund, because although they're funded by the state, they need to
[28:14.120 --> 28:18.400]  get better equipment. But excuse me, sir. I mean, to be clear here, you were
[28:18.400 --> 28:24.400]  assaulted from behind by a Danish thug, a Danish member of the government, a
[28:24.400 --> 28:27.520]  police officer, and then they did the speech. That's right. He was a police
[28:27.520 --> 28:32.200]  officer who, I think, let's be fair to them. They were under pressure from the
[28:32.200 --> 28:39.360]  very nasty goons who are the UN police force. The Danish police have just
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.880]  become more and more twitchy as this conference has gone on, the friction
[28:43.880 --> 28:48.800]  between them. And they've also used George Soros, UN. Very, very clear. They've also...
[28:48.800 --> 28:52.920]  I do feel some sympathy for the Danish police here. And this poor chap, he just
[28:52.920 --> 28:56.720]  didn't know where to turn. In the end, he just decided he would take a swipe at me
[28:56.720 --> 29:01.640]  and, unfortunately, knocked me to the ground and knocked me out. Did he hit you
[29:01.640 --> 29:06.320]  with a billy club in the head, sir? No, no, no. It was just... I mean, he had a
[29:06.320 --> 29:10.600]  glove hand and he pushed me a little too hard in the back and knocked me
[29:10.600 --> 29:16.280]  flying. So let's not kind of overstate this. It was a pretty minor incident. But if you
[29:16.280 --> 29:20.280]  did that to him, you'd be up on attempted murder charges. I would be
[29:20.280 --> 29:24.760]  locked up for assaulting a police officer. No doubt about it at all. And I'd be sent home in
[29:24.760 --> 29:28.360]  disgrace and never learned back into Denmark again. He will get off stop
[29:28.360 --> 29:33.720]  free and probably be given a promotion. That's the way it now is. So I do feel
[29:33.720 --> 29:37.840]  some sympathy for him. He was under a lot of pressure from them. Of course, we could
[29:37.840 --> 29:41.000]  be trying to get into the conference. He was under a certain pressure. All right, Lord
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.720]  Monkton, stay there. I want to get into all the other areas to cover in a long

[32:04.120 --> 32:08.320]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[32:08.320 --> 32:12.640]  bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[32:12.640 --> 32:16.600]  electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of
[32:16.600 --> 32:20.960]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[32:20.960 --> 32:25.280]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[32:25.280 --> 32:29.080]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[32:29.080 --> 32:33.160]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[32:33.160 --> 32:36.880]  families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar
[32:36.880 --> 32:40.960]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I
[32:40.960 --> 32:43.680]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[32:43.680 --> 32:47.080]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at
[32:47.080 --> 32:53.080]  www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't
[32:53.080 --> 33:18.080]  own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:18.080 --> 33:25.160]  Well, I had to squeeze the information on the board mocked and he's too gentlemanly to really tell you what happened to him, but he's
[33:25.160 --> 33:32.320]  caught up and really, really got thrashed to the ground bad and he is filing a
[33:32.320 --> 33:36.680]  complaint through someone he knows in the Danish parliament and we, you know, we
[33:36.680 --> 33:41.320]  need to not forgive police when they assault us from behind because if this
[33:41.320 --> 33:45.040]  is allowed to continue, next they'll be snatching and grabbing us like what
[33:45.040 --> 33:49.560]  happened at the G20 a few months ago. We're uniformed, military, we're snatching
[33:49.560 --> 33:53.120]  and grabbing peaceful protesters off the streets. Lord Monkton, I know you don't
[33:53.120 --> 33:57.160]  want to spend too much more time on this, but finishing up, any other comments
[33:57.160 --> 34:01.840]  about how you were assaulted and how the UN, I mean, I've seen countless videos of
[34:01.840 --> 34:06.840]  accredited reporters. If they ask about Climate Gate, armed UN police drag them
[34:06.840 --> 34:16.200]  away, the climate cultists on the streets, if anyone, I mean, video after video, we
[34:16.200 --> 34:20.680]  have multiple videos posted on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com today where
[34:20.680 --> 34:23.600]  people are being interviewed and they say, well, I question man-made climate
[34:23.600 --> 34:29.120]  change. I think Climate Gate's important, bottles and rocks and apples begin hitting
[34:29.120 --> 34:34.520]  them in the face and hissing, attacking. I mean, these are authoritarian thugs, not
[34:34.520 --> 34:39.880]  just the police, not just the UN. I mean, the acolytes of this, when you talk
[34:39.880 --> 34:44.920]  about Nuremberg, electric atmosphere, and we have Schwarzenegger telling Rolling
[34:44.920 --> 34:50.360]  Stones, he dreams of being a dictator like Hitler at Nuremberg. He now is
[34:50.360 --> 34:56.440]  emerging as the leader, openly saying in French news agency, in the telegraph and
[34:56.440 --> 35:01.720]  others, that he's going to lead a movement to bypass the US government, the
[35:01.720 --> 35:06.840]  federal government, at the state and city level to implement this global
[35:06.840 --> 35:11.840]  governance grid. He says global governance and planetary transformation. Is this
[35:11.840 --> 35:18.000]  not sedition by Schwarzenegger saying he will come into our nation as a usurper
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.640]  and bypass the Senate? Well, I think we're covering quite a lot of ground there,
[35:22.640 --> 35:26.200]  starting off with, I think what we was put into perspective as a relatively
[35:26.200 --> 35:31.920]  small incident. I mean, okay, yes, I'm a peer of the realm, but no, policemen shouldn't
[35:31.920 --> 35:35.920]  be going around bashing people in the back. But I think the poor guy hadn't
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.800]  realized that he sort of overdid it a bit. He hadn't intended to knock it
[35:39.800 --> 35:43.360]  off the ground. It was just unfortunate that I was in a particular position where
[35:43.360 --> 35:47.840]  when he hit me, I tripped over and fell flat on my face. I don't think he meant
[35:47.840 --> 35:53.120]  it. I do think he should have, having been warned not to put his hands on me, he
[35:53.120 --> 35:58.000]  shouldn't have done that. And I think in due course, he will be disciplined and
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.920]  probably put down a rank for a year or two to remind him that you don't treat
[36:01.920 --> 36:07.320]  people that way. So let's not over magnify that. And I do feel a lot of
[36:07.320 --> 36:12.320]  difficulties with the Danish police in that they are clearly being under orders
[36:12.320 --> 36:18.960]  from these very, very nasty, flinty-faced goons of the UN Security Force who are
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.320]  hated by acts of this, everybody who's come into contact with them. They are very
[36:23.320 --> 36:29.120]  spooky people indeed. And it is quite unfortunate that the UN, when it runs
[36:29.120 --> 36:33.920]  these conferences, doesn't allow the local police to run the show. It sends it
[36:33.920 --> 36:39.320]  though, dreadful people it. And they are really hated and feared now. Those are the
[36:39.320 --> 36:43.080]  ones I ultimately hope responsible for the events we've seen, you know, the
[36:43.080 --> 36:47.640]  Danish police laying in not just to our side, to be clear, but also to
[36:47.640 --> 36:51.680]  demonstrate it from the other side with Trumps. I mean, they've been bashing them.
[36:51.680 --> 36:56.920]  And that's also been shown on television worldwide. And it has led me and
[36:56.920 --> 37:01.840]  others to comment that perhaps the Danes and the UN don't quite understand what
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.720]  being in a democracy is all about. So moving on from that then to Schwarzenegger
[37:06.720 --> 37:11.280]  and him saying that this is such a pressing problem that he's going to
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.040]  circumvent the government, I don't think he'll get away with that. He too
[37:16.040 --> 37:20.880]  could find himself impeached if he tries to go against the U.S. Constitution. The
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.880]  Constitution is there. And we now see what an important document it is,
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.200]  regarded by Obama and his people. And they sent it to an election campaign as a
[37:30.200 --> 37:35.040]  piece of paper that is now an obstacle to what the left wishes to achieve
[37:35.040 --> 37:38.920]  internationally. And Schwarzenegger, although he's nominally a Republican,
[37:38.920 --> 37:42.760]  is clearly more and more identifying himself with the effect of it. And I'm
[37:42.760 --> 37:46.600]  going to use the word the communist left that are now running America and much
[37:46.600 --> 37:51.080]  of much else in the world. And I think what we have to do is to say that if
[37:51.080 --> 37:55.400]  anybody breaks the law in the way that Schwarzenegger is supposed to do, then
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.360]  however high a senior they may be in their local area, they will be taken to
[38:00.360 --> 38:04.880]  task and taken if necessary to court for that. So I don't think that he's going to
[38:04.880 --> 38:08.840]  get away with that. I think that mere Roderman Tardy of the sort that you get
[38:08.840 --> 38:13.080]  at these conferences, they overstate everything for the entry, much as the UN
[38:13.080 --> 38:17.640]  has been doing all the law about this. And so we shouldn't get too excited by
[38:17.640 --> 38:22.360]  that. If he tries to do anything of that kind, he will get stopped eventually.
[38:22.360 --> 38:27.440]  Well, well, well, yes, sir. But I mean, Lord Monkton, here's a quick example. He
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.000]  couldn't get the legislature of California to pass taxes on all
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.720]  televisions and ban them above 40 inches, saying he, you know, he's the
[38:35.720 --> 38:42.120]  Gropin Führer, the Group Führer. He's going to decide as the cowlider what type
[38:42.120 --> 38:45.800]  of TV you can have. So he just ordered the California Department of Energy to
[38:45.800 --> 38:52.040]  do it by fiat. Now he is calling for a summit of mayors, and the UN had a
[38:52.040 --> 38:56.920]  summit of mayors there to have the cities levy the taxes. A bunch of other U.S.
[38:56.920 --> 39:02.360]  cities are doing this. I know some of the governments in England, I mean, in the
[39:02.360 --> 39:05.240]  United States, and it's the same all over the western world, for those that don't
[39:05.240 --> 39:08.440]  know, you have the federal government, you have the state governments, and
[39:08.440 --> 39:13.240]  cities and counties and local municipalities are chartered through the
[39:13.240 --> 39:17.960]  state constitution. So this is a form of rebellion to have
[39:17.960 --> 39:23.960]  Schwarzenegger saying, we're going to go to cities to have them begin the looting
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.440]  and the rendering of booty to the international organizations. We have the
[39:28.440 --> 39:32.680]  UN, just as they've gone into the universities and taken them over, actively
[39:32.680 --> 39:36.600]  trying to take over our communities, and we need to route them out. That's my only
[39:36.600 --> 39:42.040]  point. Right, and you're quite right, and the way to do that is to make sure that
[39:42.040 --> 39:46.200]  any state or local organization that oversteps
[39:46.200 --> 39:51.640]  its power is taken to court under the altraviris.
[39:51.640 --> 39:55.240]  That means anything that is beyond your power, altraviris, in that
[39:55.240 --> 40:00.360]  sense, that's the core phrase. You aren't allowed to do that, and it is not
[40:00.360 --> 40:06.360]  permissible for local administration to live in federal taxes.
[40:06.360 --> 40:11.240]  So if they try to start playing that game, all it takes is one good
[40:11.240 --> 40:14.920]  to take them to court, to the federal court, and say, look,
[40:14.920 --> 40:19.240]  this is not allowed, is it? The federal court will look at it and say, no it is,
[40:19.240 --> 40:23.400]  and they will impose whatever penalties are necessary, whatever orders the court
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.760]  are necessary, stop the local administration doing this.
[40:26.760 --> 40:30.600]  So you do still have a constitution in the United States
[40:30.600 --> 40:34.760]  that basically works, and if anyone, like the EPA,
[40:34.760 --> 40:39.080]  or local government, or state government, try to
[40:39.080 --> 40:45.720]  overtop the rights of the US legislature to make and unmake the laws
[40:45.720 --> 40:48.760]  that you elected them to make and unmake, then
[40:48.760 --> 40:52.440]  you will be defending your democracy if you take them to court and say,
[40:52.440 --> 40:57.080]  we will not have this imposed upon us. We are doing this in the UK all the time,
[40:57.080 --> 40:59.160]  because we recently had our local government
[40:59.160 --> 41:04.680]  trying to impose some damn full tax on us, and they said they had the right to do
[41:04.680 --> 41:09.560]  this under some European directive or another, and we said, no, you don't have
[41:09.560 --> 41:13.880]  the right to do that to us, so we are not paying, and if you try to make us pay,
[41:13.880 --> 41:17.320]  we will take you to court, and they were so frightened that they said, okay, we'll
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.160]  leave you alone and we won't pay. So clearly when you stand up and fight to
[41:21.160 --> 41:26.200]  this illegal strategy, they fold, but the question is, will we stand and fight?
[41:26.200 --> 41:30.520]  Now, I want to get into strategy. In layman's terms, you're probably the
[41:30.520 --> 41:33.880]  leading expert in the world, not just on the science from studying it and
[41:33.880 --> 41:37.320]  interviewing all the scientists, but on how their fraud works, how their
[41:37.320 --> 41:40.040]  organization works, how their propaganda works,
[41:40.040 --> 41:43.160]  how their bureaucracy, their takeover by stealth works,
[41:43.160 --> 41:47.480]  specifically Lord Christopher Monkton joining us live in the final days, the
[41:47.480 --> 41:51.080]  climax of the summit tomorrow in the next week.
[41:51.080 --> 41:54.840]  Specifically, you're saying that they are going to get an agreement,
[41:54.840 --> 42:00.040]  it's going to be a stealth agreement. Explain that to us and what you expect
[42:00.040 --> 42:03.720]  to happen tomorrow with Obama and what we can do
[42:03.720 --> 42:08.280]  understanding their cloaked attack profile.
[42:08.280 --> 42:12.040]  Right, the first thing they will do, and the one thing that I think they were
[42:12.040 --> 42:14.760]  always going to succeed in doing at this conference,
[42:14.760 --> 42:20.520]  is to agree to establish what will be delicately called the institutional
[42:20.520 --> 42:24.840]  framework. Now, that is a code word for world government.
[42:24.840 --> 42:28.520]  They're no longer calling it world government because they tried that,
[42:28.520 --> 42:33.480]  I spotted it, I publicized it, the world went, ah, we're not having that.
[42:33.480 --> 42:37.000]  And so they've been, they've beaten off using the word,
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.720]  but they're going to keep the structure. They're going to use this conference,
[42:41.720 --> 42:45.640]  the agreement that they will reach here to set up
[42:45.640 --> 42:49.640]  the institutional framework, which means in effect the world government,
[42:49.640 --> 42:53.080]  and they're going to take from the western countries
[42:53.080 --> 42:57.480]  the very large financial resources required to do that.
[42:57.480 --> 43:01.960]  That's the one thing they are definitely going to succeed in doing here,
[43:01.960 --> 43:05.320]  and they will announce that as a victory in itself,
[43:05.320 --> 43:10.440]  and they will be right because that is the one and only single aim of this
[43:10.440 --> 43:14.680]  entire global warming norm. It is to establish the mechanism,
[43:14.680 --> 43:19.240]  the structure, and above all the funding for a world government,
[43:19.240 --> 43:21.640]  and that is what they're going to get agreement for.
[43:21.640 --> 43:26.440]  And they will disguise it by saying we're setting up a $10 billion fund or
[43:26.440 --> 43:31.480]  $100 billion fund for adaptation to climate change in third world
[43:31.480 --> 43:34.760]  countries, but actually this money will almost all be
[43:34.760 --> 43:39.240]  gobbled up by the international bureaucracy.
[43:39.240 --> 43:42.360]  And because of the way that governments now hide
[43:42.360 --> 43:46.760]  from their people, how it is they're spending the people's money,
[43:46.760 --> 43:49.960]  and exactly how much is going to international organizations.
[43:49.960 --> 43:53.160]  When I had a question put down in the House of Lords about how much Britain
[43:53.160 --> 43:55.960]  has given to the UN's climate panel over the years,
[43:55.960 --> 43:59.400]  the answer I got was we do not have this information.
[43:59.400 --> 44:03.240]  Well, of course they have the information, but they're not going to tell us,
[44:03.240 --> 44:08.440]  and the difficulty will be in finding out what they are actually doing.
[44:08.440 --> 44:11.720]  But if they declare that they are going to do this,
[44:11.720 --> 44:15.320]  and they don't have the constitutional authority,
[44:15.320 --> 44:17.960]  and that will certainly be the case in the United States,
[44:17.960 --> 44:21.800]  then it is possible for you in the United States to fight it
[44:21.800 --> 44:25.240]  and stop them paying the money to this organization,
[44:25.240 --> 44:29.480]  unless it can be shown that they have the constitutional authority to do it.
[44:29.480 --> 44:34.280]  Absolutely, Lord Mountain. They don't have that constitutional authority
[44:34.280 --> 44:38.280]  unless this is a treaty and unless it is ratified by the Senate.
[44:38.280 --> 44:43.000]  So I think that with luck, anything that comes out in just the form
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.760]  of a constitutional, of an executive agreement
[44:46.760 --> 44:52.200]  will be something which you can overthrow and defeat and say no to.
[44:52.200 --> 44:56.280]  Even though the Supreme Court will bend over backwards to what Obama wants,
[44:56.280 --> 44:59.400]  in the end it does have to uphold the Constitution,
[44:59.400 --> 45:04.360]  and it can't, I think, countenance the circumvention of the Constitution
[45:04.360 --> 45:08.920]  by the executive agreement procedure on a treaty with such major financial
[45:08.920 --> 45:11.240]  and political implications as this.
[45:11.240 --> 45:14.280]  Okay, Lord Christopher Mountain, again, sorry to be interrupting,
[45:14.280 --> 45:18.040]  but I want to move into some other areas and get your expertise on them.
[45:18.040 --> 45:22.680]  I want to play a short clip, but this is a story up on prisonplanet.com,
[45:22.680 --> 45:26.440]  infowars.net. Steve Watson out of the UK wrote it.
[45:26.440 --> 45:33.320]  Rothschild talks about the difficulty of global government's
[45:33.320 --> 45:38.120]  agenda at Copenhagen. So he talks about the difficulty of selling this.
[45:38.120 --> 45:41.960]  So I want to play the clip and then ask you, Lord Monkton,
[45:41.960 --> 45:46.120]  why did they deny world government for so long when it was in their own documents?
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.600]  Then they came out in the last couple months and admitted,
[45:48.600 --> 45:51.640]  okay, it's global government, run by private groups,
[45:51.640 --> 45:56.120]  and then now they're retreating from that but still pushing the agenda.
[45:56.120 --> 46:02.440]  It appears on the surface that they are really beginning to
[46:02.440 --> 46:06.520]  show real signs of stress and that this is a mortal wound,
[46:06.520 --> 46:10.840]  that climate gate is literally hemorrhaging all of their support.
[46:10.840 --> 46:12.920]  But here is the short clip.
[46:12.920 --> 46:16.600]  Yeah, it's past the point of talking. We know historically that the global
[46:16.600 --> 46:21.480]  governance, the sort of agenda to these issues is very hard to try.
[46:21.480 --> 46:25.080]  And with all the best intentions, it's very hard to actually activate.
[46:25.080 --> 46:27.800]  We're seeing that right now. We're seeing a lot of fragmentation going on in
[46:27.800 --> 46:30.600]  Copenhagen, a lot of different agendas pulling different
[46:30.600 --> 46:34.440]  directions. And I think what we're really to see is people on the ground
[46:34.440 --> 46:37.880]  starting to actually act upon the low hanging fruit and start to try and move
[46:37.880 --> 46:40.360]  on the solutions that we have at hand.
[46:40.360 --> 46:45.080]  Okay, so that's the headline Rothschild Rues, difficulty of advancing global
[46:45.080 --> 46:50.040]  governance agenda at Copenhagen. That was on Bloomberg Television. Lord Monkton.
[46:50.040 --> 46:54.280]  Yes, I think he's right. I think they are finding it difficult
[46:54.280 --> 46:58.520]  because they got caught out. You see, let's remember how they hid
[46:58.520 --> 47:03.640]  this treaty with the word government in it. What they did was they put it on the
[47:03.640 --> 47:05.960]  website of the Conference of State Parties for the
[47:05.960 --> 47:10.120]  they weren't mentioned on climate change, but they called it a note by the
[47:10.120 --> 47:13.880]  Secretariat. And it was only a vigilant friend of mine
[47:13.880 --> 47:17.240]  who realized it was too large to just a note by the Secretariat.
[47:17.240 --> 47:21.160]  Too big a file. He overdid, found this treaty, buried at the back of the
[47:21.160 --> 47:25.240]  vote, 186 pages at the back of a two page note.
[47:25.240 --> 47:28.840]  And there, in it, when I read it, was this business
[47:28.840 --> 47:33.800]  in annex one of paragraph 3638 about a world government was going to take over
[47:33.800 --> 47:36.280]  all the financial and other markets. They've been at that thing as a free
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.000]  market anymore. That lavish taxation, et cetera, et cetera, huge powers
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.840]  never had any government worldwide had such powers as this was going to have.
[47:44.840 --> 47:48.120]  And they got caught out. They had hoped they could leave it there.
[47:48.120 --> 47:51.240]  And then when they got this through at Copenhagen, people started getting
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.480]  saying, we hadn't realized it meant this. They would have said, but it was on our website all
[47:55.480 --> 47:58.600]  the time. That was the cheesy game they were trying to
[47:58.600 --> 48:02.840]  play. And they didn't get away with it because it was publicized and because
[48:02.840 --> 48:07.000]  particularly in the United States, people stood up and got in touch with their
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.520]  legislators and said, we are not having this. This treaty shall not pass.
[48:12.520 --> 48:16.120]  It became really impossible for them to get away with it in the way that they
[48:16.120 --> 48:19.560]  had originally hoped. They still hoped that by making it an
[48:19.560 --> 48:23.480]  agreement, by taking out the word government, but by leaving in all the
[48:23.480 --> 48:26.840]  institutional framework, which is what they're now calling the world
[48:26.840 --> 48:29.960]  government, they might still get away with it.
[48:29.960 --> 48:34.200]  And now what Rothschild is saying is even that is proving problematic
[48:34.200 --> 48:38.760]  because there are so many pressures, particularly from ordinary Americans
[48:38.760 --> 48:43.240]  getting in touch with their legislators using their last few days
[48:43.240 --> 48:47.800]  of democracy and freedom to fight to keep it that way.
[48:47.800 --> 48:53.240]  That is what above all else has helped the rail.
[48:55.080 --> 49:02.840]  We just lost our guest, so we will reconnect
[49:04.520 --> 49:12.760]  with him as soon as we can. That actually sounds like a power outage to me.
[49:12.760 --> 49:18.920]  I will get Lord Monkton back on the line with us,
[49:18.920 --> 49:22.520]  having a lot of phone troubles lately.
[49:22.840 --> 49:26.280]  But think about it, world government is now out in the open and they go on
[49:26.280 --> 49:30.280]  international Bloomberg TV and say, oh yes, people don't like our global
[49:30.280 --> 49:33.960]  governance, so we've got to go with a low-lying fruit.
[49:33.960 --> 49:41.400]  And what is the low-lying fruit? We're going to ask Lord Monkton
[49:41.400 --> 49:45.160]  that question now. Sir, can you hear me again?
[49:45.160 --> 49:49.240]  Yes, I can, loud and clear. Okay, well the the the miracle of technology
[49:49.240 --> 49:51.640]  we're talking to you in Europe, we're here in the United States.
[49:51.640 --> 49:55.320]  What is the low-lying fruit he's talking about? Is that what you're discussing
[49:55.320 --> 49:58.440]  of how they're going to do this by stealth through the bureaucracy
[49:58.440 --> 50:01.640]  and through just getting national governments to just
[50:01.640 --> 50:06.040]  give tax money to this body like they've been doing in the past?
[50:06.040 --> 50:09.800]  That's right. What they'll do is they'll start with the institutional
[50:09.800 --> 50:13.000]  framework, this is the world government structure,
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.120]  because that doesn't require any agreement about how much the western
[50:18.120 --> 50:21.320]  countries will pay towards the poor countries,
[50:21.320 --> 50:25.400]  how much money the poor countries will get, how much CO2 emissions
[50:25.400 --> 50:29.960]  western countries will have to reduce ditto ditto. All of that difficult stuff
[50:29.960 --> 50:33.800]  they won't do. They will do the easy bit and the easy bit
[50:33.800 --> 50:37.000]  bureaucratically has always agreed to set up a bureaucracy.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.960]  All bureaucraties are very good at setting up new bureaucracy.
[50:39.960 --> 50:44.200]  So that's what that's what he means by low hanging fruit. He means
[50:44.200 --> 50:48.920]  let's set up the world government and that's what they're going to do and I
[50:48.920 --> 50:52.920]  think that's the one outcome which is more or less guaranteed
[50:52.920 --> 50:57.640]  from tomorrow's final negotiation. This conference is actually due to end tomorrow.
[50:57.640 --> 51:02.200]  It will in fact go into an all night session. Hounded by debt collectors with
[51:02.200 --> 51:06.280]  phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[51:06.280 --> 51:10.520]  Don't greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[51:10.520 --> 51:14.680]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free
[51:14.680 --> 51:17.960]  with New York Times bestselling author Herb K's
[51:17.960 --> 51:21.800]  number one debt secret, the how to on stopping the calls
[51:21.800 --> 51:26.760]  without paying the debt companies. Yes, free for a very limited time.
[51:26.760 --> 51:30.840]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give
[51:30.840 --> 51:34.120]  you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[51:34.120 --> 51:37.640]  Herb K was right. His free information helped me stop the calls
[51:37.640 --> 51:39.880]  and settle my debt. What have you got to lose?
[51:39.880 --> 51:43.640]  Stop the calls now. Get out of debt and have more money.
[51:43.640 --> 51:47.000]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free.
[51:47.000 --> 52:01.560]  Now call 888-352-7726. That's 888-352-7726. 888-352-7726.
[52:01.560 --> 52:05.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[52:05.560 --> 52:08.760]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[52:08.760 --> 52:12.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[52:12.760 --> 52:15.960]  Americans at home. We have tremendous influence
[52:15.960 --> 52:19.960]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[52:19.960 --> 52:25.240]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[52:25.240 --> 52:28.440]  For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[52:28.440 --> 52:32.840]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[52:32.840 --> 52:35.320]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[52:35.320 --> 52:39.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[52:39.160 --> 52:41.720]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to?
[52:41.720 --> 52:46.040]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC
[52:46.040 --> 52:51.080]  we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic

[53:00.200 --> 53:04.840]  Say no to government vaccinations. Say no to toxic overload. Say no to chemicals.
[53:04.840 --> 53:08.920]  Say yes to liquid zeolites. When you have fatigue, problems concentrating,
[53:08.920 --> 53:12.680]  muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza or joint pain.
[53:12.680 --> 53:15.560]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[53:15.560 --> 53:19.320]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become
[53:19.320 --> 53:22.760]  stronger to fight off viruses. Why risk government vaccinations?
[53:22.760 --> 53:27.320]  Liquid zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals,
[53:27.320 --> 53:30.200]  boosting energy levels and promoting a strong immune system.
[53:30.200 --> 53:34.440]  Liquid zeolite is tasteless, odorless and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[53:34.440 --> 53:37.080]  Feel great again and as little as three days to three weeks.

[54:17.720 --> 54:20.840]  Well Lord Christopher Moncton has been very, very gracious to be with us. He has
[54:20.840 --> 54:24.760]  another interview coming up. He'll be with us five minutes into the next hour.
[54:24.760 --> 54:31.000]  So specifically the talks are in trouble. They are somewhat of a failure but you're
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.080]  saying they will get their structure of global government and that is a great defeat to liberty
[54:37.080 --> 54:42.040]  but we then need to oppose it. You're saying really the final day is tomorrow,
[54:42.040 --> 54:45.080]  it may go into Saturday. Lord Moncton explain that to us.
[54:45.080 --> 54:51.240]  Yes, tomorrow is the final full day of the conference and the way the script for these
[54:51.240 --> 54:56.680]  things usually works. As I said earlier, we've had the leaked documents by the Danish government
[54:56.680 --> 55:00.520]  at the beginning. That's part of the standard script. We've had the delegations walking out
[55:00.520 --> 55:04.760]  first the Africans then the Chinese. That's part of the standard script. Then we've had the
[55:04.760 --> 55:09.160]  demonstrations with the functional wielding police. That happened earlier this week. That's
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.640]  part of the script. Then we have the endless news that it's all going to be a complete failure
[55:13.640 --> 55:18.120]  and nothing will be agreed at all. That's part of the standard script. Then we will get, and you
[55:18.120 --> 55:23.240]  heard it here first, the all night session at the end during which Obama calls them all together and
[55:23.240 --> 55:29.000]  says, come on Kat, we've got to go the last mile, we've got to get the agreement. And what they will
[55:29.000 --> 55:34.040]  agree at the end of the all night session when they come out with their stubbly chins and their
[55:34.040 --> 55:39.720]  long faces, the back of the eyes and the smile saying we've done it, they will agree on the one
[55:39.720 --> 55:44.600]  thing which is what the UN has wanted all along and Maurice Strong has wanted along. They will
[55:44.600 --> 55:50.120]  agree on what is being called the institutional framework but which is actually these interlocking
[55:50.120 --> 55:56.280]  bureaucracies, very expensive and very powerful that will constitute the world government. Once
[55:56.280 --> 56:01.960]  they've got the bureaucracies in place, they will gradually by successive treaties and agreements
[56:01.960 --> 56:08.040]  down the years transfer more and more power to the bureaucracy. So the key thing they've got to
[56:08.040 --> 56:14.600]  achieve here, if they don't achieve it here, they never will, is to get this bureaucracy in place.
[56:14.600 --> 56:20.840]  That is what they're going to agree to. But if they can't get the United States Senate to sign on,
[56:21.400 --> 56:26.920]  then how do they get it through? I guess they just continue by by stealth, death by a thousand cuts
[56:26.920 --> 56:33.000]  just like EU expansion was built. They'll do it first of all, see with all the countries that
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.360]  still agree. And then the United States will find herself isolated, that would be the game.
[56:38.920 --> 56:46.120]  And a huge pressure on Obama to conform, he will then try to find ways of covertly
[56:46.120 --> 56:51.560]  funding it and he finds that he can't do that because I think the Republicans in the Senate
[56:51.560 --> 56:56.200]  in particular have woken up to the data now and they're going to fight it if he tried anything
[56:56.200 --> 57:01.800]  unconstitutional. But eventually the hope will be that if you put the bureaucracy there,
[57:01.800 --> 57:07.160]  you get all the other nations to start funding it. Eventually you will get a US administration that
[57:07.160 --> 57:11.160]  will just get too tired of resisting it and it will eventually sign. So we need to get on the
[57:11.160 --> 57:18.040]  offensive and start removing their bureaucracy. So overall, is Climate Gate, is this year's Copenhagen
[57:18.040 --> 57:23.080]  what the UN called the most important meeting ever, is this a defeat for them, a setback,
[57:24.200 --> 57:29.640]  I mean as a general in 60 seconds to the troops, Lord Monkton, what is our situation,
[57:29.640 --> 57:34.840]  what is your report, your briefing to us, what is the state of our fight?
[57:35.800 --> 57:43.240]  My briefing to you is this, world government is coming because the leaders of the West have given
[57:43.240 --> 57:49.160]  up, they no longer care about democracy, they no longer care about the truth about the climate,
[57:49.160 --> 57:54.520]  they are willing to go along with this world government because they see roles for themselves
[57:54.520 --> 58:00.280]  in that world government in exactly the same way as the leaders of the EU did and we saw them
[58:00.280 --> 58:05.240]  wobbling just a few weeks ago over who was going to become the first permanent president
[58:05.240 --> 58:11.800]  of this ghastly dictatorial entity because they were going to get more power as president of the
[58:11.800 --> 58:17.960]  EU without ever having to face an election than they would ever have at home. And the same thing
[58:17.960 --> 58:23.560]  is the case here and I think the way we can attack this world government, which is going to be set
[58:23.560 --> 58:29.560]  up because they are going to get away with that, is to demand that unless it is an elected government
[58:29.560 --> 58:35.400]  we will have no party. Absolutely, we'll come back with a final five minutes and continue with
[58:35.400 --> 58:40.280]  solutions and ask Lord Monkton, was he able to wake up any of these climate cultists?
[58:42.920 --> 58:47.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:47.800 --> 58:55.480]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[58:55.480 --> 59:00.200]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[59:00.200 --> 59:06.200]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[59:06.200 --> 59:11.480]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[59:11.480 --> 59:16.120]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[59:16.120 --> 59:20.680]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[59:20.680 --> 59:25.400]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[59:25.400 --> 59:30.840]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[59:30.840 --> 59:36.200]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[59:36.200 --> 59:45.000]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[59:45.000 --> 59:49.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[59:53.240 --> 59:58.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:12.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:21.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:30.440]  It is Tuesday, the 8th of December, 2009. We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:38.760]  Lord Christopher Monkton will be joining us from day two of the Copenhagen World
[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:44.440]  Government Establishment Summit that is going on. We'll be covering all the latest developments
[1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:52.600]  with the Climate Gate fraud and another huge development today. Copenhagen Climate Summit
[1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:58.680]  in disarray after Danish techs leak. They told the Third World they were going to be giving all
[1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:04.840]  this money from the global taxes. Turns out it's all going to go to private central banks.
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:10.280]  That was in the treaty. That's what the big banks have been saying they were going to set up for
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:16.200]  at least 20 years. But this is new news to the world. Now the summit's in even more trouble
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:20.840]  because the Third World is finding out it's a screw job to shut down their industry.
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:25.240]  They were sold by the same IMF and World Bank that have been robbing them for more than half a
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:30.600]  century that this was going to empower them and that this was going to be a new tax on the West.
[1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:36.760]  No, it's actually a tax by Western banks on them and on the people of the West. This is a huge new
[1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:42.280]  development. Also investigative journalist at the London Telegraph. Climate Gate. Barack
[1:01:42.280 --> 1:01:52.200]  Obama's rule by EPA decree is a coup d'etat against Congress made in Britain. That is the
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:58.200]  headline. Governor Jesse Ventura fresh off the premiere of his television show last Wednesday
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:05.640]  to record all time ratings on true TV. Formerly court TV will be joining us to talk about a host
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:12.920]  of issues until the bottom of the hour. Then Lord Christopher Monkton coming up in the second hour
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:22.760]  today from Copenhagen Denmark. So you'll definitely want to stay with us for that. This is going to
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:26.920]  be extremely informative and I'm lining up a bunch of other reporters to be on with us this week
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:33.000]  and next week in the two week long summit or roughly two weeks. What is the 13 day long
[1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:43.800]  summit being held in Copenhagen Denmark. So that is all coming up today as well. Also more on Senate
[1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:49.480]  leader Harry Reid comparing opponents of health care reform to supporters of slavery. You don't
[1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:54.920]  like socialist government. You're a racist. It's the N word has nothing to do with it. They just
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:03:00.600]  inject that in there. When this is actually government slavery making you buy insurance,
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:06.760]  making you have more money taken out of your taxes for this whole eugenics soft kill program
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:13.720]  that is modern health care and with a 41 billion dollar cut a year in Medicare alone that the
[1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:20.520]  Democrats have stripped out of Medicaid and Medicare even more than 41 billion total just 41
[1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:27.400]  just 41 billion with Medicare alone. So they're the ones actually raising taxes cutting services
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:36.600]  while meanwhile invoking race cards and slavery. Again, they're race pimps. They use race as a tool
[1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:42.280]  of division. We're going to be breaking that down today as well. Also, I've gotten some emails of
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:50.680]  people in denial. We have confirmed that around the country, gun shops, Walmart gun shows are
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:57.400]  demanding social security numbers and ID cards that they scan or record to get into gun shows.
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:01.800]  And some gun shows are just getting the last four digits. Yes, that is really going on and
[1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:07.720]  we're investigating that as well. Very, very serious because it's being done outside of the law.
[1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:14.760]  It's being done literally just as a form of intimidation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
[1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:21.640]  and Firearms and now explosives. They're always changing their name as they run around the nation
[1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:29.000]  basically intimidating people. But when we get back from break, Governor Jesse Ventura will be on
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:35.400]  with us talk about the huge success of his number one TV show, number one on True TV,
[1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:45.640]  part two airing 10 p.m. Eastern tomorrow night on True TV. We'll talk about the upcoming episodes
[1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:51.720]  as well and a lot more. His last interview, he's doing it with us before he leaves the
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:57.400]  Mexico for a few weeks of surfing. I bet he wishes he was in Hawaii. They're recording record waves
[1:04:57.400 --> 1:05:04.760]  there right now. The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:09.160]  want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that
[1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:14.600]  makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a

[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:07.160]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:12.120]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:17.400]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity
[1:07:17.400 --> 1:07:22.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:27.880]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:33.080]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:37.800]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:42.280]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:46.440]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:07.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's a
[1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:19.400]  war on for your mind. Well, I am again honored to have former Minnesota governor, movie star,
[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:27.080]  top wrestler, best-selling author, XFL and NFL commentator, and so much more. Governor Jesse
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:32.680]  Ventura with us until the bottom of the hour. Lord Christopher Monkton joining us coming up
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:38.360]  52 minutes from now from the Copenhagen Global Government Summit, but I wanted to get the
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:44.360]  governor on and luckily I caught him because this is his last interview. He is leaving
[1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:52.360]  in the next 24 hours to Mexico for a few months of surfing, and so we are certainly honored
[1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:56.520]  to have him on with us. Governor Ventura, good to have you here. Good morning, Alex.
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:09:02.840]  So this is your swan song before you escape to Mexico. Hopefully. Actually,
[1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:07.800]  I'm not leaving within the next 24, but I would tell you it will be within the next week.
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:10.600]  Okay, because I talked to your wife and she thought you were leaving.
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:15.720]  I don't know. Maybe she's going to pack me up and we'll be out of here tonight. I don't know.
[1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:19.080]  That was last Friday. They're usually in charge.
[1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:27.320]  Well, I tell you, you have been busy. Well, congratulations on the television show being
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:34.360]  the highest rated new show in true TV history. Massive viewer show. Well, it did well, you know,
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:39.240]  considering all the options out there, Alex, and that there's, you know, literally hundreds of
[1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:46.280]  stations that a viewer has to choose from. They couldn't be happier. I couldn't be happier. And
[1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:51.480]  I want to thank your listeners and that because they're certainly a part of it. Now the key now
[1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:57.320]  is to keep the momentum rolling and hopefully the show will grow. Hopefully word of mouth will get
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:03.080]  out there and there is a buzz, believe it or not. And hopefully the show will continue to grow in
[1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:08.600]  viewership and that way it'll pretty much force their hand. They'll have to redo for more. And
[1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:14.520]  then we can continue our investigations and continue enlightening the public and asking the
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:20.840]  questions. Can we get definitive answers? Not always, because naturally we can't put anyone
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:26.440]  under oath and threaten them with perjury or subpoena, anybody. But we certainly can pose the
[1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:34.280]  question and continue to question authority, which is good, in my opinion, and hopefully get
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:40.600]  more people involved in the process and wake the lemmings up a little bit. So did you lose the
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:47.880]  bet? I mean you betted that the show wouldn't air with your crew or your crew. I happily lost
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:53.720]  the bet. It was a gentleman's bet, so of course there was nothing involved, no material or monetary
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:11:01.320]  involvement. But I happily lost the bet. I never thought that I thought at the 11th hour someone
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:06.840]  would come in and pull the plug on this project. They have not. The first one aired, of course,
[1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:13.480]  on Harp last week. Tomorrow night should be on the infamous 9-11. And you know, again,
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:21.320]  I defend myself by saying this. I went out and spoke to three different people who were all at
[1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:29.160]  the site when it happened. And within that day, the other gentlemen spent 256 consecutive days
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:35.720]  there working. And all of these interviews I do with these people tell a far different story
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:41.320]  than what the government told us. Now, you then ask yourself the question, who do you want to
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:46.360]  believe? Do you want to believe the government bureaucracy and the bureaucrats in Washington
[1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:52.280]  that weren't there? Or do you want to believe three people who were hands-on, two of them
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:59.880]  surviving the attack? And the other one starting that very day that spent 256 consecutive days
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:06.760]  at the site, who do you want to believe? Well, I'll unequivocally state that I believe the people
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:14.520]  I talk to. Well, for those that don't... And I don't want to tip the show off completely. So
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:20.760]  that's why I'm kind of talking in generalities and not naming names. Sure. Well, I, you know,
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:26.760]  have got a large idea of, I mean, I know the inside baseball, and I think people are going to be
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:33.800]  amazed when they see this tomorrow night. A lot of people couldn't believe this would go on mainstream
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:39.400]  television. They couldn't believe that you would go on and do the harp special, and that it would
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:45.960]  be basically all from our perspective or point of view, because the other side was so secretive
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:51.400]  and, you know, covered up what was really going on. People are really amazed. This is a watershed
[1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:57.320]  event to have the pro conspiracy view shown. But as you said, you just went out and searched for
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:06.120]  the truth. And you've shared with me your view on what you think the most powerful episode of the
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:15.320]  seven episodes is. Do you want to tell folks that here on air? Well, I'll tell you this. The scariest
[1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:24.600]  of the seven episodes, in my opinion, is 2012. And I'll leave it at that. That's the scariest one.
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:30.760]  The most bizarre one, in my opinion, and again, this is just my opinion, is the Manchurian
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:39.640]  candidate episode. You know, Alex throwing everything aside, the shows are going to be
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:45.880]  very entertaining. They're going to be informative. And if people even choose not to believe them,
[1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:51.480]  they certainly will be frightened by the shows, because if they are true, it is frightening.
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:59.000]  That's what the great thing was about doing these shows. And again, I'm amazed that they're on the
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:04.600]  air. But, you know, maybe they just think that I don't have the credibility anymore. Maybe they
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:08.680]  just think that it'll be meaningless. But the other reason I'm glad they're on the air,
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:15.960]  is 100 years from now, I hope that people, when they look back and study about now,
[1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:22.680]  will realize that not all of us believed what the government said on things. Not all of us were of
[1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:30.280]  the same opinion as their official story. And I think that's very important, because to every story,
[1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:36.520]  there's going to be multiple sides to it. And those multiple sides need to be heard. And fortunately,
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:42.120]  now we've got it on the record. If these seven shows air, there will at least be some type
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:47.720]  of something on the record, pretty predominantly, that indicates that not everybody believed the
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:58.600]  status quo. Well, just to be clear, I have had a chance to discover what is contained in tomorrow
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:06.200]  night's 9-11 show. And I, this is the one episode that I personally thought would probably not air.
[1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:12.280]  And it still hasn't aired. We'll see what obviously transpires tomorrow at 10 p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m.
[1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:21.080]  Central. But clearly, I know a lot of people in the production crew, and I know talking to you
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:29.720]  and others, I mean, the 9-11 show, I think is the strongest and is extremely, extremely
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:35.400]  groundbreaking and powerful. The information that is going to be aired for the first time in a fair
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:43.720]  way on national television. Well, you know, I've seen it and I stand by everything we did on it.
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:51.160]  I'm proud of the fact that we did it. You know, I'm of the believer that dissension is the greatest
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:16:00.360]  form of patriotism. I say that as often as I can because, you know, I'm a sucker for honesty and
[1:16:00.360 --> 1:16:06.280]  I'm a sucker for the truth. And I try to turn over everything I can to learn it when I think that
[1:16:06.280 --> 1:16:13.400]  there's something suspicious. And, you know, bottom line for me, Alex, is this. We're a country that
[1:16:13.400 --> 1:16:20.120]  runs by the rule of law, or at least we're supposed to. And if you follow that rule of law, you have
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:27.160]  to follow it when it's convenient as well as when it's inconvenient. And I question the fact that
[1:16:27.160 --> 1:16:36.360]  why, how can we convict someone before we've even indicted them? It runs contrary to everything this
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:42.680]  country stands for, yet people are accepting this. And what I'm saying is, Osama bin Laden,
[1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:49.080]  why has he never been indicted for 9-11? Why haven't the government convened a grand jury,
[1:16:49.080 --> 1:16:54.520]  presented evidence enough to the grand jury, which is us citizens, for us to bring down an
[1:16:54.520 --> 1:17:01.960]  indictment. It happened 8 years ago. Why hasn't that procedure been followed in our rule of law?
[1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:08.600]  The other day I was watching these hearings where that Senator Graham was grilling Holder,
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:14.520]  the Attorney General, and he asked Holder, he said, if hypothetically you caught bin Laden
[1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:21.320]  tomorrow, would you read him Miranda? And here the Attorney General hymns and haws. I would have
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:26.760]  looked at that Senator and said, absolutely, you read him Miranda. It's the rule of the land.
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:34.520]  It's our laws. You can't, you can't just ignore the law because you choose to. And then I would
[1:17:34.520 --> 1:17:40.520]  have looked at that Senator Graham and said, well, Senator, is it you who decides who Miranda gets
[1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:52.520]  read to? Come on. That's the rule of our land. Absolutely. Well, you've also made the point
[1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:57.960]  in national television interviews that six of the 10 commissioners say the 9-11 investigation was a
[1:17:57.960 --> 1:18:03.480]  fraud, a cover-up, farmer, the head lawyer has got a book coming out saying it was all a criminal
[1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:08.600]  cover-up, that the Pentagon was lying, that they agreed day one to lie to the public.
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:13.560]  I mean, you've got to have your head screwed on backwards to not call for a true independent
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:19.880]  investigation and to have the media call us kooks for simply listening to what the 9-11
[1:18:19.880 --> 1:18:25.640]  commission is saying. That's a fraud. And then we have Khalid Sheikh Mohammed held for eight years.
[1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:30.840]  They threatened to torture his kids. He confessed to everything but killing Kennedy and Lincoln.
[1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:36.280]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till three years after he was already arrested.
[1:18:36.280 --> 1:18:43.000]  Well, Alex, I don't know about that. I'm not that deep into that knowledge,
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:52.040]  but I'll take your word on it. Well, exactly. And you start looking at this evidence and
[1:18:52.040 --> 1:19:00.040]  analyzing it, and it just doesn't add up. And yet, we're attacked. We're told we're
[1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:07.800]  unpatriotic because what? We question. And what's interesting, and I will say this about the 9-11
[1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:16.200]  show, bear in mind, the show starts off with me meeting a 9-11 person who lost her daughter,
[1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:21.320]  who was pregnant with their grandchild. Oh, it's powerful. And she's appealing to me
[1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:28.520]  to seek the truth. Well, I'll tell you what, that's good enough for me. Yeah, I think one mother
[1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:34.760]  who appealed to me is good enough for me to go out and ask some questions. No, it's extremely
[1:19:34.760 --> 1:19:40.040]  powerful, folks. We're not going to let the cat out of the bag. Just watch tomorrow night, 10 p.m.
[1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:48.360]  Eastern, 9 p.m. Central, true TV. It's on cable, direct TV, dish everywhere. Definitely. And I've
[1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:53.720]  talked to a lot of people who got there. Before you let me go, bring me back. I want to give
[1:19:53.720 --> 1:19:58.680]  one comment on the global warming. Oh, no. Absolutely, sir. We've got you to the bottom
[1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:05.160]  of the hour. Stay there. Is your computer running slowly thinking about buying a new one?

[1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:07.800]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately,
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:12.040]  with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical,
[1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:16.680]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw, a free enterprise,
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:21.080]  or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt,
[1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:25.480]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading
[1:21:25.480 --> 1:21:30.040]  G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states,
[1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:35.000]  it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:39.880]  secret world of international banking cartel. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver

[1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:09.240]  in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this
[1:22:09.240 --> 1:22:14.520]  agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous
[1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:20.760]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:26.680]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the
[1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:32.840]  enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:37.720]  ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:42.440]  more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:49.480]  does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of
[1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:56.600]  Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in Super High Quality
[1:22:56.600 --> 1:23:05.080]  at PrisonPlanet.tv. This is Big John Lipscomb. World government and all its tyranny is rapidly
[1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:09.880]  approaching. The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:15.960]  tomorrow. I have two solutions for you so you and your family can stay strong and free.

[1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:32.520]  fourth the cost of many freeze dried offers of the same weight. And SurvivalistSeeds.com,
[1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:40.280]  where I just released my best offer ever, 7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:47.720]  That's over 4 pounds of seed and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades. And now
[1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:55.320]  you can get a second for a $60 savings. PatreonFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[1:23:55.320 --> 1:24:04.920]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[1:24:12.440 --> 1:24:16.680]  Well I've twisted his arm. There's so much to talk about to stay a little bit in the next segment
[1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:23.320]  with us. And then we've got Lord Moncton coming on today. There must be some kind of way out of
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:29.320]  here from frozen Minnesota to the beaches of Mexico, Governor Ventura. Well I'll be getting
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:33.880]  out of here. I gotta go clear my head out for a while. Alex, I don't know how you do it day in
[1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:40.200]  and day out. I'm heading down there and right now all I can think about is dunking my head into the
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:46.680]  ocean and shaping it, you know, and clearing my head out and start thinking again about taking
[1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:52.280]  a deep breath of freedom, which unfortunately believe it or not, I get more of that in Mexico
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:57.960]  today than I do in the United States. Americans have been basted in tyranny until they don't
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:25:03.880]  even recognize corruption. Lord Moncton was on Russian television talking about how, in many
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:08.600]  respects, they're more democratic than England now. Shifting gears into climate gate because
[1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:13.720]  that's something you wanted to comment on. You do have a global warming episode coming up later
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:20.760]  that was produced, you know, months ago and it is critical. It has Dr. Tim Ball and others.
[1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:25.640]  Plus you have an incredible insider that we actually ferreted out for you. I'm not having
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:30.920]  them on the show until that episode airs, just because I don't want to spoil it. But you have
[1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:36.760]  an insider with Maury Strong who worked for him and with him. This is extremely powerful,
[1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:42.120]  but the latest on climate gate where they confirm their internal emails from the head UN
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:47.560]  climate center, fixing the numbers, hiding the fact that for nine years the earth has actually
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:55.480]  been cooling. Well, you know, the thing that really rose, got my intended to go up was their
[1:25:55.480 --> 1:26:03.800]  solution, cap and trade. This is nothing but a shell game and Alex, even worse than that. Here's
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:12.120]  what it is. We right now pay taxes to our local government. We pay taxes to our state government
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:20.120]  and we pay taxes to our national government. This, for the first time ever, will be a tax to
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:30.200]  a world government. A world tax. That is ridiculous, I think. Yes. You know, that we're now going to
[1:26:30.200 --> 1:26:39.160]  face taxation from a world entity and that part of it is unacceptable to me top to bottom.
[1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:46.920]  And the fact that this cap and trade, it does nothing to solve the problem. We all will admit
[1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:54.280]  that pollution is bad. We'll all admit that the less we pollute this planet, the better it is.
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:27:01.480]  But when the solution that they come up with does not do anything to solve the pollution
[1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:07.720]  problem, that tells me that there's a fraud involved and that the real reason is to make
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:15.320]  money for people. And that's really what got me over the top was the fact that this cap and trade
[1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:22.680]  is nothing but a shell game. Polluters can still pollute at the same level. All they have to do
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:29.640]  is buy their way out of it and they're called neutral. Well, that's absurd and it's ridiculous
[1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:34.840]  and it's just a way for people to profit. Well, it is. And when it does that, then I want nothing
[1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:41.000]  to do with it. You know, I can't argue with the scientists because there's scientists on both sides
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.600]  of the issue and probably whichever way you lean, you're going to side with that scientist. It's
[1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:53.720]  just like how do the buildings of 9-11 fall from fires? You know, you've got popular mechanics
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:59.240]  tells the public, oh yeah, it can happen easy. You've got other scientists that say it's a bunch
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:04.920]  of crap and I personally can't figure out how it could fall at the speed of gravity. It defies
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:11.320]  basic physics. And you're a demolition expert. Exactly. Well, anyway, so I'm not going to get
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:16.360]  into the argument of the scientific end of it. I'll get into the political end of it,
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:24.120]  which this cap and trade is pure bull, top to bottom. It does nothing to solve the problem
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:29.480]  and that's what we're going to have lamb down our throat at this conference. Well, that clearly
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:36.040]  tells me that the problem can't be that important to begin with if they won't even seek out a solution
[1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:41.000]  that would attempt to cure it. Well, Governor, there's lots of real pollution like toxic waste,
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:47.160]  overfishing, but carbon dioxide, I mean, the amount that humans put out, we exhale carbon
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:52.520]  dioxide, the EPA is listing it as a toxic waste. It's what plants live off of. They then put off
[1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:57.480]  oxygen. I mean, it's a, it's a fraud. It's a distraction from all the real environmental
[1:28:57.480 --> 1:29:04.680]  problems. And now an internal Copenhagen climate summit is in disarray after Danish text leak.
[1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:10.520]  This is London Guardian. The secret text of the agreement has been released where the taxes aren't
[1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:17.880]  even paid to the UN. They're paid to private corporations, private banks setting up a private,
[1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:25.560]  global, corporate government. Horrible. And if we, if we allow this to happen, then we deserve
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:32.200]  what we get, Alex. Governor Jesse Ventura, he'll do five, six more minutes with us on the other side
[1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:38.120]  on some other key issues and Lord Christopher Moncton coming up. But tomorrow night, the most
[1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:44.280]  powerful 9-11 information ever on mainstream television, 10 p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m. central,
[1:29:44.280 --> 1:29:55.800]  conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones
[1:29:55.800 --> 1:30:04.760]  and the GCN radio network. Hi folks, this is Alex Jones. And I want to tell you about the
[1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:10.040]  Silver Lungs Generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the

[1:31:11.080 --> 1:31:15.880]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence
[1:31:15.880 --> 1:31:21.640]  on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:27.880]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:31:27.880 --> 1:31:34.360]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:39.320]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the

[1:31:58.760 --> 1:32:05.320]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[1:32:05.320 --> 1:32:10.040]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:15.320]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only
[1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:20.600]  ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will
[1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:25.160]  you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it
[1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:29.560]  make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the
[1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:35.240]  gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:32:35.240 --> 1:32:40.680]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:46.040]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[1:32:46.040 --> 1:32:55.080]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again,
[1:32:55.080 --> 1:33:17.160]  that number 1-800-409-5633.
[1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:28.120]  All right. Final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura. By the way, we've been simulcasting
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:35.320]  since the start of the show at prisonplanet.tv for viewers there. And my new film, Fall of the
[1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:40.600]  Republic, ladies and gentlemen, has an hour in the two hour 24 minutes on the whole climate fraud,
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:44.920]  how the banks are setting up a private global corporate government from their own documents.
[1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:49.960]  That's now mainstream news today, but in a film I released a month and a half ago,
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:54.840]  Fall of the Republic, available at infowars.com. Governor Jesse Ventura, I want to finish up
[1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:59.960]  with Climategate and then finally ask you, what are you most upset about? What are you most outraged
[1:33:59.960 --> 1:34:05.080]  with currently? But with Climategate, how do we have the UN investigate it when they're behind it?
[1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:09.400]  How do we have the British government investigate when they're behind it? How do we have the federal
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:15.560]  government investigate when they want this new taxation control grid over all human activity?
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:21.000]  Well, you know, it simply comes back to the fact that we have to protest. We have to let our
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:27.240]  elected officials know that this is unacceptable and people have to stand up for what they believe.
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:34.120]  And in the country now, ultimately, can you prevail? There's no guarantee of that. But certainly,
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:40.120]  I would hope our country still has the freedom that people are allowed to persist on an opposite
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:46.680]  viewpoint and not be, you know, attempted to be destroyed just because they think something's
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:52.600]  different than the status quo says it is. So if you're outraged over global warming and you're
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:59.400]  outraged over tap and trade, let your congressmen and senators know that. Because the biggest thing
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:06.040]  you can do is to make a phone call or write a letter to trust me. Always remember, these guys'
[1:35:06.040 --> 1:35:13.000]  ultimate goal is to be reelected. They're there to serve themselves. They're not there to serve us.
[1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:19.000]  Career politicians, it's just what it's called. It's their career. Well, they're not going to
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:26.200]  jeopardize their careers. And if there's enough outrage voiced by the public, they will then
[1:35:26.200 --> 1:35:31.800]  listen. If there's no outrage, trust me, you're going to get it rammed down your throat. If there's
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:37.720]  no threat to their careers, they will do whatever well they damn please. Well, that's a good point.
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:43.000]  It's in the news today in the Washington Post and Washington Times that senior Democratic leaders
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:50.200]  like Senator Webb warn Obama on taking action in Copenhagen saying, look, this is red-handed fraud.
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:55.480]  They know the earth's getting cooler. They admit it's just a taxing power grab. More documents are
[1:35:55.480 --> 1:36:01.560]  leaking out. The system is bleeding out right now. This is now being called the greatest scientific
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:08.200]  fraud in modern history. And there's been many scientific frauds. And the Democrats are now
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:14.440]  panicking saying, look, you better abandon this. And now the third world countries got the secret
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:19.400]  documents today that it's really a tax on them to stop their development when they were promised
[1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:23.400]  Western money. See, they tell the third world, oh, you're going to get to rob the West. And then
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:27.720]  when really it's the big banks planning to rob them. So this whole thing is sinking.
[1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:35.320]  Well, I hope that it does. If it don't, like I said, the best thing people to do is be vocal
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:41.400]  and active. Take that time. Write that letter. Make that phone call. But let me also say this.
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:51.000]  Be civil with your phone calls. No personal insults. No personal attacks. State your business. State
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:59.480]  that what you feel and how you feel they should react to that. But don't dig yourself into a hole
[1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:06.280]  by insulting anyone. That's the worst thing you can do when you make contact with an elected official
[1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:13.240]  is throw an assault at them. You don't want to do that. But you can still be firm in your viewpoint.
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:19.960]  Now, Alex, moving ahead, I'll tell you what's outraging me right now. The war in Afghanistan.
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:24.520]  And the fact that we're going to put 30,000 of our troops in there and increase it,
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:30.760]  all while this country feels no pain. If we're going to go to these two wars, then it's time
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:37.400]  to implement a war tax to pay for them. Imagine what we're doing, Alex. We're not overly sending
[1:37:37.400 --> 1:37:42.280]  our young men and women over there to die. We're going to make it so when they come home,
[1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:48.280]  they'll get to pay for it for the rest of their lives. Because this generation doesn't have the
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:55.160]  courage enough to either stand up and get out of these wars or at least damn well pay for them
[1:37:55.160 --> 1:38:02.680]  if we're going to fight them. I also am outraged that a draft is not being reinstituted immediately.
[1:38:02.680 --> 1:38:08.840]  You've got guys that have been over there for five, six and seven tours of duty that's inhumane.
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:16.360]  They need relief. Implement the draft and you will see the wars not get bigger.
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:23.000]  You will see them come to an end. Because when little Johnny who doesn't want to go gets drafted
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:29.080]  and a year later comes home in a body bag, that has a powerful influence on the neighborhood,
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:36.680]  trust me. So you agree with Congressman Rangel that the way to end wars is to have a draft? And
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:42.840]  my problem with that is the new draft, the National Compulsory Service Act and the National
[1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:47.800]  Service Act, they have two different bills, is going, the government's going to be able to
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:53.720]  decide who gets to stay and who gets to go. And they're going to build a domestic army
[1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:59.560]  where they'll get to be basically little Nazi brown shirt thugs spying on their neighbors.
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:08.440]  And so all the Politico kids like George W. Bush, they're going to get to be domestic thugs.
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:15.240]  Before we jump to those conclusions, let's see that nobody has the courage to bring the draft
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:21.480]  back in the first place. It's not going to happen. Are you kidding me? Are you angry at Obama? I mean,
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:27.800]  is he really gone back? I agree that he would escalate that war over there after he told us
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:33.400]  he was getting us out because I'm an advocate of the true patriot right now is to bring,
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:38.680]  you know, I wish I had in front of me the letter that my son sent to me on Veterans Day,
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:45.320]  talking about how we have to be diligent, how we've dropped the ball, because it's our job as
[1:39:45.320 --> 1:39:52.200]  the civilians to protect our military. And we have not done a good job on that. And what I mean
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:57.800]  by that is we're to protect them. They're not to go out there and fight unless there's a direct
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:40:06.040]  national interest to us. And this stuff about fighting terrorism by going over and invading
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:11.480]  countries and occupying the countries with our military, that is going to do nothing
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:18.280]  to stop terrorism. It's like tap and trade. It's in fact, it's going to create more terrorists
[1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:25.000]  because if you occupy a nation, they're going to hate you. They don't love you. Imagine for a
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:31.400]  minute a Hugo Chavez with all his money, bought some land by Palm Springs and put the Venezuelan
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:38.200]  army in there. How would we feel about that? Not too good, would we? Well, how can we go around
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:45.400]  the world and have our bases in 178 foreign countries? And yet, we're supposed to pay for
[1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:50.440]  all this. We're not even paying for these wars. We're going to make the very children that fight
[1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:55.640]  the wars come back and spend the rest of their lives paying for them also. I think that's pretty
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:02.040]  pathetic that we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. Well, in closing the television show premiered
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:07.640]  last week to record ratings for True TV, the number one new show in their history,
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:16.200]  and part two on 9 11 tomorrow night, 10 p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m. Central. In closing, Governor Ventura,
[1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:24.440]  watching you as governor, a Maverick, a true rebel, a revolutionary, was very refreshing.
[1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:29.000]  Watching the media demonize you and attack you and try to set you up was painful,
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:35.720]  but you were a statesman. You left after one term. And to see you grow and just get better
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:43.240]  and better and more informed and more libertarian, more anti-globalist, and to now see your TV show
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:49.480]  be a huge hit. I certainly hope it gets picked up for a second season. But as you've said many
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:54.840]  times off air, you don't know until it's picked up, but it certainly should be. And everybody
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:59.400]  needs to do their job to spread the word about the show. But we salute your spirit of liberty.
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:05.800]  And as Mark Twain said, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:15.240]  But in the end, the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot. And so a lot of
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:20.600]  timid people are joining the ranks thanks to your leadership, Ron Paul's leadership, and so many
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:29.080]  others. And a governor have a well earned extended hiatus in Mexico and surfs up. Have fun.
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:34.680]  Thank you, Alex. And keep up the good work, man. I don't know how you do it day in and
[1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:40.600]  day out, but keep talking and keep disrupting the system because it's the American way.
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:46.440]  We'll do it. And between all of us, we won't let the country die. Thanks, Alex. Have a great
[1:42:46.440 --> 1:42:52.120]  winner. You too. Take care. All right. There goes Governor Jesse Ventura. Did I do the Mark Twain
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:56.200]  quote right? I did it right on CNN. In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated,
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:01.400]  and feared, and scorned. But in time, the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:07.160]  a patriot. Did I say it right the first time and time that timid joined him because then it cost
[1:43:07.160 --> 1:43:12.440]  nothing to be a patriot. And Jesse Ventura is the real deal. He's not perfect. I'm not perfect.
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:18.920]  None of us are perfect. But let me tell you, I know what's in this production piece. I've seen
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:26.440]  large segments of it. And I've, because last time I was out in LA a month ago, they were still editing
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:35.960]  it. So I haven't seen the finished product and it's powerful. I mean, this is not Michael Moore
[1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:42.280]  banging on doors. This is Jesse Ventura doing it. And I believe Luke Radowski's in there too. We
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:45.720]  are changed. I mean, it's certainly in the footage I've seen they are. I don't know if they're going
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:52.680]  to be in the finished thing that's done and airing tomorrow. And who knows what Time Warner's
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:44:00.600]  doing with their hands in there. But you know, the establishment, I've had reporters the last
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:05.400]  few weeks asked me, you know, why they think this Jesse Ventura show is actually going on air
[1:44:05.400 --> 1:44:11.640]  from our perspective. And it's really because the establishment has lost all credibility.
[1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:16.520]  They're losing viewers. They know that the general public wants to know about the new world order.
[1:44:17.320 --> 1:44:21.960]  And I think by putting it on true TV is entertainment. They know it'll get ratings and
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:26.280]  they just think that, well, the public's already awake. The UN's admitting world government,
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:32.760]  why deny this anymore? And I think that's what's happening here.
[1:44:35.400 --> 1:44:40.440]  You know, I have been pitched so many television shows. I have been asked to fly to New York,
[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:46.040]  asked to fly to the LA. I have been involved in TV shows. I have shot pilots with huge production
[1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:55.720]  companies and then seen it not air, seen it not air. And so when Ventura's people are asking me
[1:44:55.720 --> 1:45:01.480]  to be a consultant on this and also be in, I'm the only person that appears in multiple episodes,
[1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:09.960]  four or five, they're still, they're still editing some of them. So coming up in the next
[1:45:09.960 --> 1:45:14.040]  two weeks, I should, you should see episodes I appear in some of them, a large part of other
[1:45:14.040 --> 1:45:22.760]  parts, just a consultant and you see me introducing Jesse to people. But it's just good to see it
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:28.280]  get on air. It's like the Wall Street Journal came here and was going to do a cover story on me.
[1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:33.080]  And I said, this will never be printed. If this is not a hit piece, this will not be printed.
[1:45:33.080 --> 1:45:37.480]  And I said, did you find what you were wanting? Did you find the dirt you wanted? And no, not really.
[1:45:37.480 --> 1:45:44.280]  You know, you don't come in here and open a closet door and 45 skeletons fall out on the floor.
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:52.520]  Things have to be invented about us and it really can't be done because you judge a tree
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:55.560]  by its fruits. I mean, how many people have we woken up the new world order?
[1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:02.680]  How many times would be attacked by mainstream and alternative media and even government entities
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:08.360]  a lot? That's why I always challenge listeners. Don't get caught up in the infighting,
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:13.640]  the co-intel pro, the disinformation. You know you're good. You know you're a patriot.
[1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:19.880]  You know you're awake and aware. And so instead of knitting and spending all your time debating
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:25.000]  different radio hosts or filmmakers or patriot leaders, chief among them myself,
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:31.560]  spend your time warning people about the carbon tax, spend your time warning people about state
[1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:37.080]  victim disarmament gun control bills and federal victim disarmament bills and treaty,
[1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:40.920]  the gun control treaty with the UN Obama says he's going to sign next year,
[1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:44.680]  our blanket open borders and amnesty that will bring in the North American Union and
[1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:50.760]  further bankrupt us or forced inoculations and how dangerous the vaccines are,
[1:46:50.760 --> 1:46:56.040]  warning people about the history of vaccines and the mercury and the cancer viruses.
[1:46:56.040 --> 1:47:06.840]  We're going to come back with the winner of the Berlin Film Festival a few years ago.
[1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:12.840]  This is just part for the course of the type of short films that are shown to little kids,
[1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:18.360]  teenagers, college students. The whole cover of YouTube is our future is being decided
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:26.760]  that Copenhagen almost every video on the front page is pro global government, pro tax links.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:33.320]  I want to launch an initiative today. I got Texas monthly here interviewing me for what they say
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:42.680]  is probably going to maybe a cover story. But I'm going to try to do several YouTube videos today,
[1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:49.560]  today, that I really about Copenhagen and all the fraud that's come out there in the latest on
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:57.720]  climate gate. But I also want to do one calling for people in the next week and a half while
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:01.960]  Copenhagen is going on the establishment of world government. They're calling it the most important
[1:48:01.960 --> 1:48:06.600]  meeting in history, the declaration of world government. I'm calling on everybody to make
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:12.280]  their own YouTube videos, everyone. I don't care if you're not eloquent or if you are eloquent or
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:18.360]  if you're mediocre, just get up there, point out issues. We need thousands of videos flooding
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:24.520]  YouTube. YouTube has more video views than all other video sites combined. Sure, it's controlled.
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:28.760]  Sure, it's manipulated. Sure, it's bad many respects. But it's where the fight is
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:35.640]  with a Schmidt character that owns it, pushing world government and promoting tyranny.
[1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:41.080]  We need to take YouTube over and counter their propaganda and make videos about how they're
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:46.040]  engaged in a bunch of propaganda. Because they're whining and screaming and yelling,
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:51.560]  all the controlled corporate press and the Fortune 500, they're all redoubling. I mean,
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:59.880]  I've been watching the news and I can't believe how mindless and base and ridiculously off the
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:07.960]  chart. If I was going to make a science fiction movie about a science fiction dark satire movie
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:14.520]  about the ultimate propaganda state, I would just go point cameras at Copenhagen and show
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:18.360]  that in the movie. I mean, they've got giant billboards with little girls saying, please,
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:24.520]  I don't want to drown. And images of polar bears saying they're all dying. They're almost extinct
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:33.960]  when they've gone from 10,000 in the Arctic areas to over 45,000. Their numbers are exploding like
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:43.400]  cockroaches. And they're showing films at Copenhagen that tell schoolchildren they're all going to die.
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:52.600]  I mean, this is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. And this video coming up shows humans as a disease
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:50:02.920]  spreading across the globe and then blasting off in rocket ships to infest the galaxy as a disease.
[1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:10.120]  No, we're not a disease. Jesse Ventura is not a disease. Ron Paul is not a disease. Martin
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:16.280]  Luther King is not a disease. Leonardo da Vinci is not a disease. We are an incredible species who
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:23.800]  can produce amazing art and passion and love and honor and creativity and ideas. And the globalists
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:29.000]  know that and they want to have a control over society and control over information to dumb us
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:33.880]  down so they can control future, so they can control the destiny of humanity. We have to
[1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:39.480]  rest control over the future of humanity from these people and let humanity really make the
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:46.040]  decision what we want to do from there. That's why I don't like football and petty stuff because
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:51.480]  it's issues of no significance that don't matter as we're on this planet hurtling through intergalactic
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:59.800]  space. That's what really matters. And awaken. You don't have to agree with me. Just awaken. Wake
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:04.680]  up. Wake. You have a mortgage and a load of other debt. Wouldn't it be great if it all just went
[1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:09.080]  away? No more mortgage can change your life. We paid off all of our bills. All your debt,
[1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:13.720]  including your mortgage in as little as nine years. With no more mortgage, we will have saved
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:19.240]  over $313,000 in interest payments. Even have more money left over each month? It lowered our
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:24.840]  monthly payments by a little over $500. No more mortgage. Where have they been all of our life?
[1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:28.680]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody. Whenever I have a friend or
[1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:33.000]  someone that needs this service, I give them the number. I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More

[1:52:00.760 --> 1:52:05.320]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:09.400]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:13.960]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have all performed
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:18.200]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:23.400]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:29.400]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[1:52:29.400 --> 1:52:33.880]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in
[1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:39.080]  any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them
[1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:48.280]  today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:52:48.280 --> 1:52:57.320]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:52:57.320 --> 1:53:03.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. When you hear the words water purification,

[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:34.360]  Follow the forms of life. Guzzle your natural resources. And poison your atmosphere.
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:46.280]  Once contracted, humans act quickly. They multiply over $300,000 a day, consuming anything that
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:56.440]  crosses their path. Earth is just the start. Who knows what's next?
[1:55:02.200 --> 1:55:05.480]  Oh, they're killing the whole universe, the whole solar system.
[1:55:05.480 --> 1:55:17.480]  You've got the globalist parasites with their hookers and caviar and jets and limos.
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:23.160]  Saying carbon dioxide's bad, it's not. It's what plants live off of. You've got them running
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:29.880]  around lying to the public when carbon dioxide is a tiny part of the atmosphere to begin with,
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:37.240]  and the UN admits it's a fraction of a fraction of a fraction that we actually put off and that
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:43.000]  it's a good thing. But that doesn't matter. We're parasites, and the global government wants to get
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:48.760]  rid of us. This is what they show schoolchildren. This is what's being pushed on everyone. This
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:55.400]  is what the Fortune 500 is behind. This is what they're promoting 24-7. We've got another clip
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:59.640]  coming up later where they're teaching everybody, oh, we're going to track your car and track
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:05.480]  everywhere you go and track your carbon footprint and tax you to save the earth. No. It's a big
[1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:11.080]  brother takeover. It's a global government, private corporate takeover, and we have huge new developments
[1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:16.120]  in climate. We're going to be talking about later in the next hour with Lord Christopher Monkton.
[1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:26.440]  So you definitely want to stay with us for that today. And then after Lord Monkton leaves us,
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:33.400]  we are going to open the phones up in the third and fourth hour and cover all of this news
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:41.880]  and information. And yes, we're simulcasting the entire four-hour radio show at PrismPlanet.tv.
[1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:46.680]  And I did want to encourage listeners every month of December for every year we've had
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:55.080]  PrismPlanet.tv coming up on six years in next April. We give you five and a half months free
[1:56:55.080 --> 1:56:59.960]  at PrismPlanet.tv. You can sign up for a year and you pay for six and a half months,
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:05.240]  and you get five and a half months free. And so instead of being $5.95 a month, it comes out to
[1:57:05.240 --> 1:57:11.080]  three something. And that pays for our bandwidth, pays for our IT people, pays for the cameras,
[1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:16.280]  the videos, the travel, making the films. And I want to thank all the PrismPlanet.tv members.
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:21.720]  We have upgraded it. It has super fast servers, all of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book,
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:26.520]  Paul Watson's book. The live radio show is simulcast with the documents, the videos,
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:30.360]  the photos, the guest in studio, when you're a PrismPlanet.tv. Remember,
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:35.080]  if you can't watch it live every day, we archive higher quality audio archives
[1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:41.480]  at PrismPlanet.tv, commercial free. We also have the archive of the live TV show that we
[1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:47.400]  simulcast there for your listening and viewing convenience. Just so much more that we're adding

[1:59:58.840 --> 2:00:13.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.800 --> 2:00:22.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:31.000]  We're now into hour number two, coming up in 30 minutes. Nice old marriage.
[2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:34.200]  European Union member, Parliament from England.
[2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:43.560]  The head of the British Independence Party. That is coming up.
[2:00:43.560 --> 2:00:53.720]  Alex, spoken critic of the New World Order. Right now, I'm continuing to take your phone calls here
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:01:01.320]  today. You know, we were talking about in the last hour, how public school children,
[2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:10.040]  private school students as well, have BATF, the Department of Energy, the Department of Labor,
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:15.160]  the U.S. Census, local power companies. In fact, in England, they run the climate cops.
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:19.080]  One of the biggest power companies trains them how to spy on their parents, how their parents are
[2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:26.200]  bad. Al Gore teaches the kids to rebuke your parents. The state's taking your kids away from you.
[2:01:26.200 --> 2:01:30.680]  And you love it. You think that's, you've been cowed. You've been taught that the government
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:37.080]  and uniforms are God, and you're a slave. You have to pay taxes for the air you breathe.
[2:01:37.080 --> 2:01:43.800]  But every week, I see an article like this one where they say in art class, draw a picture of
[2:01:43.800 --> 2:01:48.520]  your father. So they draw a picture of their dad is in the army, they get arrested. And I've seen
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:58.040]  multiple cases where it's the last day of school. And it's always the valedictorian or the salutatorian.
[2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:05.320]  And it's always a woman for some reason, always a girl. And they buy a cake for their teacher.
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:10.520]  And they have a few friends after school. And there's two cases of this I've seen. I've had them
[2:02:10.520 --> 2:02:16.040]  both on. And the security guards know what to look for. They come in and say, oh, you got a cake.
[2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:22.360]  Did you bring a tablecloth and stuff? Yeah, it's right here in this bag. And you pull out the little
[2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:31.400]  Dixie cup box of knives, spoons, forks, and they arrest you. Knives. I mean, they're looking for
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:35.880]  a slave. They're looking for somebody to hurt. They're looking for somebody to get in a grid.
[2:02:39.560 --> 2:02:42.040]  But in this case, they were asked to draw a Christmas picture.
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:47.960]  And the boy drew a picture of Jesus on the cross. That's what he'd seen at church. And
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:53.560]  they suspended him and are now having him do psychological evaluations saying it's violent.
[2:02:53.560 --> 2:02:59.560]  And all it is is a picture of Jesus on the cross. Because he goes to church. And they don't care.
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:05.400]  The school's not apologizing. That's the way it is. Because it's a crime to draw a picture of Jesus.
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:11.000]  See, separation in church and state now means you don't talk about God. That's why schools all over
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:15.720]  the country, kids will have a Bible in their bag. They'll throw it away and freak out like it's
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:25.880]  pornography. Separation in church and state was a letter by a founder to a newspaper. It's not
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:31.560]  in there. But the issue is you don't have government running religion. Not you don't have religion
[2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:36.440]  anywhere in the society. But the point is this is just Soviet Union. I don't think on the Soviet
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:41.800]  Union they expelled kids for drawing a picture of a kid on the cross. I mean, this is the hatred
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:46.120]  of Christians. And you got to remember Trotsky was the main guy that killed millions of Christians
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:52.600]  in Russia and blew up their churches in Ukraine. And then he got kicked out and came to the U.S.
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:04:01.400]  And his top lieutenant was William Crystal's father. I mean, that's a fact that the neocons
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:06.280]  are actually just nation records. These are revolutionaries. And they've got Homeland
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:11.000]  Security in place. They've got the National Police Force in place. The Homeland Security's top,
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:14.840]  the number one threat, the number one evil is conservatives, gun owners, libertarians, patriots.
[2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:21.000]  And they want to set up a Russian style purge of landowners and people.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:26.120]  And they run Obama. And it's all a big joke to them. I mean, it's funny.
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:31.080]  It's funny that this is their country now and they're going to try to run a purge.
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:34.840]  It's nothing to do with Soviets. Now they call themselves right-wingers.
[2:04:35.640 --> 2:04:39.000]  They're just thugs. They know how to get into the government, take it over and start killing.
[2:04:40.280 --> 2:04:45.000]  They've done a super good job in China and in Russia and in Cuba, everywhere else.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:51.960]  The same financial interest actually funded Hitler. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:57.400]  But Massachusetts boys spend it over Jesus on cross self-portraits. You don't do that in
[2:04:57.400 --> 2:05:00.520]  the land of the free home of the Bray. The thought police are going to...
[2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:05.800]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[2:05:05.800 --> 2:05:10.360]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:15.480]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[2:06:02.120 --> 2:06:07.080]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[2:06:07.080 --> 2:06:12.200]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:17.160]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of
[2:06:17.160 --> 2:06:22.440]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the
[2:06:22.440 --> 2:06:27.800]  country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:06:27.800 --> 2:06:32.520]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:36.920]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five,
[2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:41.400]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[2:06:41.400 --> 2:06:45.160]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my
[2:06:45.160 --> 2:06:52.200]  oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[2:07:00.840 --> 2:07:05.400]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:10.600]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[2:07:10.600 --> 2:07:16.280]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[2:07:16.280 --> 2:07:21.560]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:26.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[2:07:26.200 --> 2:07:30.760]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:35.480]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:40.920]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[2:07:40.920 --> 2:07:46.280]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[2:07:46.280 --> 2:07:55.000]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.

[2:08:04.600 --> 2:08:20.280]  The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:25.240]  Yeah, that's the freedom of the new America. You get caught with a plastic knife in your
[2:08:25.240 --> 2:08:31.000]  lunchbox. You got a jail. You draw a picture of your dad on a hunting trip. You got a jail.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:37.720]  They tell you to draw a picture for Christmas. You get suspended and psychological testing
[2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:44.520]  ordered because it was seen as bizarre by them to draw a picture of Jesus on the cross.
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:52.920]  You can see the photo up at infowars.com and prismplanet.com. Mass Boy suspended over Jesus
[2:08:52.920 --> 2:09:00.200]  on cross self-portrait. The 8-year-old special needs student. Boy, they just batter those kids.
[2:09:01.240 --> 2:09:06.040]  Somebody they probably hit with a bunch of mercury in their shots. The 8-year-old special
[2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:10.680]  needs student near Boston will be changing schools after being suspended and given a
[2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:16.600]  psychological evaluation for a Christmas drawing of himself as Jesus on the cross.
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:24.760]  But it's not himself. He just said that to spin it. The boy drew the stick figure crucifixion
[2:09:24.760 --> 2:09:30.840]  after his teacher at Max Ham Elementary School asked for a class for his pictures that reminded
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:37.800]  them of the holidays. The Christ figure had axes for eyes and the boy wrote his name above that.
[2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:42.280]  Well, what child watching TV wouldn't see stuff like that. That alarmed the teacher
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:47.400]  considering a violent drawing and the boy was suspended in order to be evaluated at his parents
[2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:51.880]  expense. I mean, think of all the violent video games the culture says, just give your kids and
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:57.800]  all the violence on TV. But then the minute, I mean, I've seen no exaggeration more than 50 times.
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:02.440]  I mean, it's got, I'm just estimating probably 100. You've seen it over and over again where
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:08.680]  you'll have some 14-year-old no criminal record on the football team in one case
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:15.320]  was for creative writing in the sophomore year in high school.
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:20.920]  Writes a story about zombies attacking a fictitious high school
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:27.800]  and his parents reported him and the school commended them and he was arrested and it's
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:34.200]  now been charged facing all these years in prison for planning an attack on the school.
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:42.040]  And the police are on record saying, well, we, I mean, folks, for fiction articles, they arrest you now.
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:51.480]  Well, that's zero tolerance. You always hear, we found out about a plan to bomb the school
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:56.200]  and you find out it's always some essay written.
[2:10:56.200 --> 2:11:03.320]  See, do as we say, not as we do, put all this violence and stuff out in the culture.
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:08.680]  All the new top video games, you rape and kill prostitutes for money. Are you walking
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:12.520]  to airports and run false flags, killing U.S. citizens, the blame on your enemies?
[2:11:12.520 --> 2:11:15.320]  You know, people fantasizing of the government staging terror.
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:20.520]  I mean, I know multiple top games right now you do that, like Call of Duty and others.
[2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:26.120]  I can show you the video of it. Russian stage false flags, the American stage false flags,
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:32.280]  of course, the real Army manual, 2004 teaches Army captains how to stage terror attacks.
[2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:37.080]  I mean, they're teaching captains how to stage terror attacks. And then the video games teach
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:42.760]  them how to do it too. But God forbid you draw a picture of Jesus, baby, you're going to jail.
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:50.920]  You're going to jail. You're getting kicked out of school. You're getting a psychological
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:12:00.040]  evaluation. This is the secret police grid in America with all of our psychological minders.
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:03.960]  See, they start political correctness with some of the sounds reasonable.
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:07.560]  Don't deny that Hitler was bad and killed a bunch of people or will arrest you.
[2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:12.520]  Don't use the N word or will arrest you. And then it next, it's don't deny global
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:17.800]  warmings man made or will arrest you. They're calling for Lord Monkton in the London Guardian
[2:12:17.800 --> 2:12:26.760]  to be arrested and executed. Anyone who questions at a press conference is arrested or detained.
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:31.560]  You have press credentials at a UN event. You go up and ask about Climate Gate.
[2:12:31.560 --> 2:12:34.680]  Men with guns run up and drag you out. Oh, that's freedom.
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:41.000]  We've been trained to be slaves. We have to rediscover what freedom is.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.480]  Let me just tell you in a free society, half the billboards driving down the highway
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:50.680]  aren't government admonishments bossing you around, setting the precedent that they're the bosses
[2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:56.520]  and you're the criminals. I mean, you go watch a movie like Running Man released in 1984,
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:00.840]  and every other billboard is a government announcement and announcements about how to
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:06.520]  turn family members in. Now I turn on Austin News and see Austin Police Department ads
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:11.640]  enrolling children with credit cards that get 200 bucks when you turn into family member.
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:17.560]  I'm living in the Running Man. We're only one step away from Ben Richards going to his brother's
[2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:22.040]  apartment and saying, where is my brother? Well, after you got arrested, Mr. Richards,
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:29.960]  he complained so he got permanently detained. That means killed.
[2:13:31.960 --> 2:13:33.960]  And Ben Richards looks up in shock.
[2:13:33.960 --> 2:13:40.520]  Now they're starting the snatch and grabs of citizens.
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:47.960]  They have created giant cadres of criminal CIA officers and private contractors who think it's
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:52.200]  funny to grab citizens off the street, put a bag over their head or come in your house at night
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:56.680]  and drag you off and you're never seen again. They like torturing people. They like hacking
[2:13:56.680 --> 2:14:01.800]  fingers off with hatchets. Chuck Norris made movies like Delta Force where the Muslims
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:07.640]  put drills into our troops' legs. Did you know actually the CIA manual, they use drills
[2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:14.760]  on people? That's what they do. Oh, but it's bad when the Muslims use drills fictitiously,
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:17.400]  but when our government uses drills, it's good.
[2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:26.200]  Jeffrey Dahmer used drills on people, but it's bad when he does it, but not bad when the CIA
[2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:35.320]  does it. We have a bankrupt moral government. It's morally bankrupt. It's rotten, rotten to its very
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:43.080]  maggot-filled core. And the sooner we wake up to that, the better. Now,
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:49.080]  you think 23.7 trillion, that's a four-month-old number. It's probably over 30 trillion
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:51.880]  following the graph, but 23.7 trillion stolen is bad.
[2:14:51.880 --> 2:14:59.880]  When they start gutting the dollar, which is already beginning, but when they devalue it by
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:04.840]  two-thirds, that's probably what they're going to go at least half in just the next year or so.
[2:15:04.840 --> 2:15:13.960]  That's currently what they're doing. The standard of living, you'll have less jobs, lower pay,
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:21.160]  but things will cost more. Hyper depression, an inflationary depression. The worst thing there is.
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:25.800]  They didn't have that during the Great Depression. It was just a depression.
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:31.000]  There wasn't inflation. It was actual deflation. Hyper
[2:15:34.200 --> 2:15:38.760]  stag inflation is what I call it. Stagnation with inflation.
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:47.480]  Now, we could go after the bankers. We could expose them as the criminals,
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:51.320]  and that's what I keep pointing out. Bypass the Republicans and Democrats, point out
[2:15:51.320 --> 2:15:54.760]  the source of the dictatorship, the source of the fraud, Bernanke,
[2:15:56.360 --> 2:16:01.640]  Paulson, Summers, Reuben. That's why you see all the news now just saying,
[2:16:01.640 --> 2:16:07.080]  Bernanke is God. Bernanke will save you. He's man of the year. He kept you from having a depression.
[2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:13.240]  He loves you. Meanwhile, they set the policies and have told the world to go ahead and devalue
[2:16:13.240 --> 2:16:17.880]  the dollar. The decision was made in the last three G20 meetings. Here is the Times of London
[2:16:17.880 --> 2:16:22.440]  today. I have another London Telegraph article, also an AP article on this,
[2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:29.640]  Gulf Petro powers to launch currency in latest threat to dollar hegemony. The Arab states of
[2:16:29.640 --> 2:16:34.280]  the Gulf region have agreed to launch a single currency modeled on the euro, hoping to blaze
[2:16:34.280 --> 2:16:38.920]  a trail towards a pan American monetary union swelling to the ancient borders.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:51.080]  And then it goes into one of the Turkish imams, Ottoman Empire. So they want the whole system
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:58.200]  from Turkey into Afghanistan to have this new currency. The Gulf monetary union pact has come
[2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:05.800]  into effect, said Kuwait's finance minister Mustafa Al Shamali, speaking at the Gulf Cooperation
[2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:12.120]  Summit Council at GCC summit in Kuwait. The move will give the hyper rich club of oil exporters
[2:17:12.120 --> 2:17:17.320]  a petro currency of their own, greatly increasing their influence. Folks, that is the end of the
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:22.040]  dollar because you got about half the fuel in the world being bought from these guys,
[2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:28.760]  a little more than half. And they're saying we're not going to take your stinking dollars.
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:33.240]  You got to transfer your euros, your dollars, whatever the case is into our petro dollar.
[2:17:33.240 --> 2:17:37.880]  And the dollars been the petro dollar. That's it. I'm going to cover this more coming up in the
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:42.040]  next segment before Nigel Farage joins us from England. But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[2:17:42.040 --> 2:17:47.640]  Ted, this is it. This is the end of the dollar guaranteed. They're launching it. This is the
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:52.280]  end. There may be some big currency wars, some type of North American currency may come roaring
[2:17:52.280 --> 2:17:56.680]  back later. That's how they'll sell it. But regardless, for the average American, you think
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:18:01.080]  you're in bad financial straits, he will get at least twice as bad now because of this. And this
[2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:04.680]  will start hitting in the next 12 months. Ted Anderson. Yeah, I was looking at the same article
[2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:09.800]  this morning, Alex, and they say it right here. It says the US dollar has failed and we need to
[2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:14.120]  delink ourselves from the US dollar. That's why the Arabs are trying to get away from it.
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:18.360]  And they're saying you got to buy oil from us in this. So that's the end of the dollar. This is
[2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:22.920]  it. It really is. It was the last reason why countries like China had to have US dollars as
[2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:27.560]  reserves because they needed to use it to buy energy. Meanwhile, everybody's hearing about
[2:18:27.560 --> 2:18:35.320]  how great Bernanke is, how evil Tiger Woods is, and we're hearing about Obama's wife's latest
[2:18:35.320 --> 2:18:41.640]  dress because Ted, that's what really matters. Will the Cowboys win next Sunday, Ted? Not the
[2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:46.360]  total destruction of our future, Ted. No, you're right about that, Alex. And gold is running up
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:52.120]  today. It went up to 1140 and it's been a strong marketing goal. And here we are back on that,
[2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:56.600]  Ben Wagan again. As you said a week ago when it plunged, and Bob Chapman and others have
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:01.640]  predicted the correction, that it would go down maybe 100, maybe more and then surge right back
[2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:07.080]  up in the new year, go past it. And to explain it, people had positions. They were dumping it and
[2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:12.280]  profit taking. They'd been short gold. A bunch of central banks went in to try to drive it down,
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:16.760]  but it's like a beach ball. They can only hold it down so long and the longer they hold it down,
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:21.160]  the more explosively it comes up. You're right about that. And that's what's going on right now.
[2:19:21.720 --> 2:19:25.640]  The dollar is taking a hit again today. There was a lot of propping up with the dollar that
[2:19:25.640 --> 2:19:31.640]  occurred here in the last week, week and a half. Gold did take a dive down to about 1116.
[2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:37.160]  It's jumping right back up again. The market is becoming bullish. I mean, I just, I had a great
[2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:41.720]  opportunity to accumulate things at lower prices. I think we should talk about that.
[2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:45.800]  Yeah, folks, get your pens and paper ready so you can check these deals for yourself and see
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:50.360]  how good they are quickly. I'm going to get more into this article or group of articles
[2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:54.360]  as they dump the dollar, as the dollar dies, as the World Reserve currency,
[2:19:55.080 --> 2:19:58.440]  and the yuppies have no idea what's even happening. They're just sucking their thumbs.
[2:19:58.440 --> 2:20:06.440]  A revolution in smoking is underway. A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarette should

[2:21:00.280 --> 2:21:05.320]  world. Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to
[2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:11.160]  ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coin citizens would use for commerce.
[2:21:11.160 --> 2:21:16.680]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the Fiat continental system. Wisdom being lost
[2:21:16.680 --> 2:21:21.800]  with time. The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private
[2:21:21.800 --> 2:21:27.320]  business, creating the largest Fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced. This is not
[2:21:27.320 --> 2:21:31.880]  only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government,
[2:21:31.880 --> 2:21:36.600]  but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value. Now foreign
[2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:41.720]  governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency. Hi, this is Ted
[2:21:41.720 --> 2:21:49.320]  Anderson. I'm offering a book that explains how the system works. Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[2:21:49.320 --> 2:21:56.280]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book. Call today at 800-686-2237.
[2:21:56.280 --> 2:22:06.280]  Again, that's 800-686-2237. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:11.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[2:22:11.800 --> 2:22:15.800]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have turned a tremendous
[2:22:15.800 --> 2:22:21.480]  influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's
[2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:27.720]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies
[2:22:27.720 --> 2:22:33.560]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty,
[2:22:33.560 --> 2:22:38.360]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:42.440]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:22:42.440 --> 2:22:48.760]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the
[2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:56.040]  Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right

[2:23:14.440 --> 2:23:19.640]  the wild food experience. I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering
[2:23:19.640 --> 2:23:24.840]  if I even needed another book. Boy was I wrong. My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of
[2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:29.400]  wild foods. In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[2:23:29.400 --> 2:23:33.960]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today. Wow. I watched the DVD
[2:23:33.960 --> 2:23:39.480]  last night. I was awestruck. What wonderful work you have done. This information can bless many
[2:23:39.480 --> 2:23:45.400]  people. Thank you again. Thanks again. Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration. Thank

[2:24:20.600 --> 2:24:29.720]  chance. And listen, another kiss, another kiss.
[2:24:34.280 --> 2:24:37.560]  We're going live at BrisbanePlanet.TV at the start of the next segment.
[2:24:39.160 --> 2:24:45.560]  Ted Anderson, fire out the gold and silver you've got. Did you have any left from the
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:52.040]  really low price from a month or so ago when gold made its dip or is the new lower prices
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:55.720]  you've got from the latest dip despite the fact that I don't know, gold's up 30-something bucks
[2:24:55.720 --> 2:25:02.200]  the last two days? When gold shot up to $1,240 an ounce, we pretty well sold out of that stuff
[2:25:02.200 --> 2:25:07.960]  that we had down there at that 1,050 range. Right now, I'm working at about $1,116, which
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:13.720]  obviously is a good buy when we're looking at $1,140 an ounce today. Frank's right now are at
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:21.160]  $260. They were just up to $266 here just a short time ago. I was able to drop the price
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:26.920]  accordingly because of that. The British sovereigns right now at $322 are going to cost closer to
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:34.360]  $328. The Montana silver coin, people are starting to take a look at those. It's the Montana people
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:39.720]  trying to set up their own currency. I don't blame them for doing it. Right now, they're at $20.99.
[2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:47.320]  They just came up off of that $22 level. The Lakota coin right now is at $23.19. Everybody
[2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:52.760]  knows that one went up over $25. There's a lot of things that are going on right now in the marketplace.
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:58.120]  I was able to buy in here. I'm guessing that we'll be back up over that $1,200 an ounce just like
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:03.880]  Bob Chapin had said it would. We're watching the dollar right now. Like you said, oil separating
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:08.200]  from the U.S. dollar means that there's going to be a tremendous weakness in the dollar because
[2:26:08.200 --> 2:26:12.840]  there's a lot of countries that are sitting on reserves and they're going to be needing to sell
[2:26:12.840 --> 2:26:15.880]  to get out onto another currency in order to buy this energy now.
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:24.840]  Absolutely, Ted. I mean, I just hope that people do get involved in gold and silver because there's
[2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:29.560]  not much more you can do to defend yourself against the bankers and how they've purposefully set up
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:34.440]  the fall of the dollar. Again, they ran the dollar up. They printed tens of trillions of it
[2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:40.360]  and issued it, issued debt on its back on the taxpayers. Now they're announcing that they're
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:44.440]  just going to devalue it. And then on top of the devaluation that Americans are going to have to
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:49.960]  have a value added tax and a sales tax, and they're having all the fake conservatives and neocons
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:55.640]  and fake libertarians like Beck and O'Reilly say that it's conservative to have tax hikes.
[2:26:56.200 --> 2:27:01.080]  Instead of just saying, no, the government tripled under Bush quadrupled the first year under
[2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:07.240]  Obama. We need to reduce the size of government. No, instead, they're just going to basically hold
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:11.720]  you by your ankles and shake every dime out of your pocket. And now is the time to get into
[2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:16.120]  gold and silver. Ted, throw out the offer. Tell folks the gold and silver that you've got and
[2:27:16.120 --> 2:27:20.520]  just how good a deal it is because I've seen the numbers. Yeah, the Franks currently right now are
[2:27:20.520 --> 2:27:27.800]  260 British sovereigns at 322 Montana silver coins. I mean, I'm looking at $18 silver now.
[2:27:27.800 --> 2:27:32.680]  It's it's poking into that level. That's going to be back up there at that $22 level instead of
[2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:38.840]  2099. Lakota's are going to be going up too. I mean, everything that I have, I've accumulated
[2:27:38.840 --> 2:27:46.360]  lately at that 1100 or that 1116 dollar level. You know, I'm, you know, what do you do? I mean,
[2:27:46.360 --> 2:27:52.600]  I, I run out of inventory and now I'm going to have to buy in closer to 240 or 1140. And you
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:57.560]  know, we're looking at $1,200. I just need to tell you right now, there's just too many things
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:28:05.080]  that are happening. The dollar is going to be in trouble. And I think you should call 1-800-686-2237.
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:09.160]  Get involved in this market, man. If you've been sitting on the sideline because you think
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:14.040]  gold was too high at that $1,200 level, right now you're getting that opportunity to buy it
[2:28:14.040 --> 2:28:19.080]  at about $100 less. And I just, I have to tell you, I think it's a great time to be doing it.
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:22.440]  And you should be doing it before we hit the new year here because like you say,
[2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:27.880]  the Christmas time happens to be a lull for gold historically. January happens to be a time where
[2:28:27.880 --> 2:28:32.520]  it all bounces back up again. And I have no expectation that it's going to go the other
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:36.520]  direction, not at this point, not with what's going on in the global economy.
[2:28:37.880 --> 2:28:47.800]  800-686-2237, 800-686-2237. Ted buys it when it's low,
[2:28:47.800 --> 2:28:54.280]  sells it for low when it's high. That's his free market system. It's like getting in a time machine
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:29:01.800]  and going back and buying gold when it was less. Same thing with silver, 800-686-2237.
[2:29:03.640 --> 2:29:07.560]  And it's key to tell them it's the Alex Jones, Ted Anderson radio special,
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:12.120]  or you will be paying the higher price, which is also a discounted great deal.
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:25.400]  But to get the lower price, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237. Take action today or check out

[2:32:00.520 --> 2:32:05.080]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:32:05.080 --> 2:32:09.400]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:32:09.400 --> 2:32:14.440]  Number two, our new energies are ones to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:20.040]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:32:20.040 --> 2:32:25.080]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:32:25.080 --> 2:32:30.360]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[2:32:30.360 --> 2:32:34.840]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[2:32:34.840 --> 2:32:39.720]  from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:32:39.720 --> 2:32:43.560]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered
[2:32:43.560 --> 2:32:47.720]  by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at

[2:33:20.920 --> 2:33:26.200]  Shame on you, Prime Minister, for doing that. You have devalued democracy in our country.
[2:33:26.200 --> 2:33:31.320]  You have devalued the trust that voters have got in you as a British Prime Minister. But,
[2:33:31.320 --> 2:33:37.560]  of course, we know the reason why. The reason why is that we would have voted no. You said in
[2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:44.120]  your speech that none but those on the extremes oppose European Union. Well, that may be right
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:49.560]  amongst professional career politicians, but a clear majority of the British people
[2:33:49.560 --> 2:33:55.320]  want us to have friendship and free trade with the European Union, but do not want to be members
[2:33:55.320 --> 2:34:04.680]  of this political union. You cannot continue against public opinion to build this European Union.
[2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:10.280]  If you do it against the will of the people, you are storing up enormous social and political
[2:34:10.280 --> 2:34:15.720]  problems for the future. Please, please, let the peoples of Europe decide their destiny.
[2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:20.920]  Don't have it done in parliaments like this and parliaments like Westminster. It won't work.
[2:34:21.560 --> 2:34:27.000]  And as far as the economy is concerned, you've told us that somehow you're the economic guru.
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:31.800]  You're the man that can save the world. Well, I remember very well your first big
[2:34:31.800 --> 2:34:41.240]  actors, Chancellor, when you sold 400 metric tons of gold on the world's exchanges at $275
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:47.960]  an ounce. At today's valuation, that would be $10 billion higher. But it isn't just the fact
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:52.680]  you got it wrong because we can all get it wrong. It was the fact that you announced in advance how
[2:34:52.680 --> 2:34:58.040]  much you were going to sell and on what day you were going to sell it. It was an era so basic
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:03.400]  that the average A-level economic student, even in these educationally devalued times,
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:08.440]  wouldn't have done. To add to that, you've destroyed our private pension system. You took
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:13.800]  away from the Bank of England its ability to regulate the banks and gave it to the tick-box
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:19.960]  bureaucrats at the FSA in Canary Wharf. And we haven't heard an apology. Your government has
[2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:25.560]  apologized for the Ambritsar massacre. You've apologized for slavery. You've apologized for
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:31.240]  virtually everything. Will you please apologize for what you did as British Chancellor and then
[2:35:31.240 --> 2:35:45.000]  perhaps we might just listen to you. Thank you. Well, that's Nigel Farage,
[2:35:47.560 --> 2:35:56.040]  member of the European Union Parliament from England. Also the head of the UK Independence
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:01.560]  Party, one of the fastest growing parties in the UK. He just resigned from that position
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:09.000]  so he can run against someone in higher office. He'll explain to us all the intricacies of that.
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:13.560]  But we're very, very excited to have Mr. Farage on with us. Thank you for joining us.
[2:36:13.560 --> 2:36:20.520]  Thank you very much indeed. The website is ukip.org or UK Independence Party
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:26.600]  for Americans that don't know who you are. A lot of folks know who Lord Moncton is and others and
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:31.880]  you have a lot of fans here as well for standing up against EU corruption and tyranny. In a nutshell,
[2:36:31.880 --> 2:36:37.480]  tell us about yourself, about the UK Independence Party and why you've resigned as the head of
[2:36:37.480 --> 2:36:44.120]  your party to intensify the fight. I was in business. I left school. I went straight into the
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:49.640]  city of London and I was going about a fairly normal life. You know, I played four handicap
[2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:54.520]  golf. I went to the local pub on Sunday lunch times. I had children growing up at school.
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:59.960]  I was running a business in the city and to all intents and purposes. I wasn't involved in politics
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:07.080]  on a day-to-day basis at all. But in the early 1990s, I saw a disastrous attempt by the British
[2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:12.200]  government with no opposition at all to peg the level of sterling against the Deutsche
[2:37:12.200 --> 2:37:16.440]  Mark. It was called the exchange rate mechanism and I predicted that it would go badly wrong
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:22.280]  and sure enough, it did. And then I realized that this was part of a bigger project, a project
[2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:27.080]  that the British political elite were engaged in along with the elites from the other European
[2:37:27.080 --> 2:37:33.400]  countries and that was to take something that we've been told was a common market, a European
[2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:39.160]  economic community, but actually ferociously and without ever telling the truth or giving anyone
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:45.240]  a say to turn that into a political union. And the day I realized that whether it was
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:50.200]  labor or conservative, it made no difference because their high commands were all sold
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:55.560]  by this idea of a new supranational form of European government. I thought I can't live
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:38:00.360]  with this anymore. I thought I've got to get involved in politics and so I did. And so about
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:07.080]  12 of us sat in a room in the early-mid 1990s and we formed the UK Independence Party and our
[2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:11.400]  battle is, you know, we want to be friends with our European neighbors. We want to trade with them.
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:15.800]  We want to cooperate with them. And we're quite happy for people from Paris to work in London
[2:38:15.800 --> 2:38:22.920]  and vice versa. What we don't want is for the situation we have where by 75% of our laws that
[2:38:22.920 --> 2:38:28.440]  are made every year are made in foreign institutions. And so through the 90s, this became kind of a
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:33.960]  crusade for me, I guess. And in the end, I was elected to the European Parliament in 1999.
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:38.920]  We were still then a very small party. But the things that we've been saying
[2:38:38.920 --> 2:38:43.000]  are now really hitting home with the British public. And in the European elections this year
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:50.680]  in June, UKIP, UK Independence Party came second across the entire United Kingdom. So that's,
[2:38:50.680 --> 2:38:56.360]  you know, a fantastic rate of progress. We've got the British public with us. We're educating them.
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:39:01.800]  They're coming on side with our point of view. Do it all the years. I find myself now leading
[2:39:01.800 --> 2:39:07.320]  the opposition group in the European Parliament. I've got 33 MEPs from several different countries
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:12.520]  who've got the same opinion. So I am the voice of opposition inside this European Parliament.
[2:39:12.520 --> 2:39:18.040]  But I was also having to run UKIP in the United Kingdom as well. And given that we've got a
[2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:23.160]  general election coming up in about six months' time, the prospect of running a group here
[2:39:23.160 --> 2:39:29.320]  and of leading a campaign with 550 candidates for the National Parliament, you know, the party's
[2:39:29.320 --> 2:39:35.560]  outgrown one man doing it. So I've stood down as leader of the National Party. I'm staying on
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:39.880]  for the moment as leader of the group in the Parliament. And I'm breaking
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:45.560]  with what's supposed to be a convention. And that is that the speaker of the House of Commons and
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:50.200]  any of you that watch Prime Minister's Question Time, you know, the great punch and duty show
[2:39:50.200 --> 2:39:54.520]  that we have in Westminster once a week, we'll see there's a guy in the chair who's the speaker.
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:59.480]  Well, the new guy we've got, I consider wholly unsuitable. And in previous times,
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:05.000]  he was always reelected unopposed. But I'm now taking him on and I'm fighting him
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:07.640]  for his Westminster seat in the next general election.
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:12.920]  So you are boldly taking action and you've been very successful in business previously.
[2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:18.520]  Did great in college. You had a successful business career. You were forced to go into
[2:40:18.520 --> 2:40:26.680]  this extremely eloquent. You absolutely just have devastated Von Ruhm Pui and Gordon Brown
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:33.400]  in the European Parliament. The papers in Europe really are singling you out as the leading force
[2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:39.560]  energizing people from across Europe that know that the European Union has become dictatorial.
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:45.320]  If nations vote to get out of it, they just expand it. They've lied in England. For those
[2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:51.160]  that don't know, please enlighten our audience saying that the British people would get to vote
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:56.360]  on whether or not they went under EU control. But that's being done by stealth, just like the
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:41:02.200]  United States is being brought into the European Union sway through agreements and through the
[2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:07.960]  North American Union agreement of the SPP. We have the SPP documents where they talk about
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:13.640]  this being done by stealth. We have the Club of Rome documents. We have the EU documents.
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:20.120]  We have Von Ruhm Pui now saying it's a global government. I mean, this really is a group of
[2:41:20.120 --> 2:41:26.520]  would be dictators. And so your fight on the continent against this is so important when we
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:34.120]  have UK polls of over 80%, don't want to be part of the EU, but still England is being sucked by
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:40.600]  this octopus in. Break this down for us. European Union Member of Parliament, Nigel Farage.
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:45.320]  Yeah, I mean, what's happening in the European Union is not happening in isolation. We have a
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:52.040]  political class across the world that are basically aiming for a form of global governance.
[2:41:52.040 --> 2:41:56.760]  You know, if you don't believe me, look at what's happening as we speak in Copenhagen. I mean, what's
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:02.200]  happening there is governments are sitting around the table trying to sign us up to treat
[2:42:02.200 --> 2:42:09.480]  us on a very, very questionable concept of global warming caused by CO2 emissions.
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:15.080]  But if they get these deals in theory, you know, we're bound for the next 20 or 30 years,
[2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:20.280]  and it doesn't matter who we vote for them. And my take on this is that the real battle
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:26.040]  that is going on in the Western world right now, it's a battle of democracy versus bureaucracy.
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:31.640]  And the bureaucrats and our arrogant politicians at the moment have got the upper hand. But where
[2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:36.840]  we're starting to win, we're starting to win with public opinion. And in the end, you know,
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:41.400]  they can push these things as far as they like. But in the end, public opinion will tear all of
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:45.960]  this down. And frankly, as far as I'm concerned, the sooner the better. And I'm doing this,
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:50.360]  and I'm saying these things. And yes, I'm being singled out for the European media, because
[2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:54.760]  there's virtually nobody else in elected politics from Britain that has actually got the courage
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:59.400]  to stand up and say it. And, you know, people sidle up to me in lifts and in restaurants,
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:04.600]  you know, fellow MEPs and MPs and say, oh, well Nigel, you know, we're very pleased that you've
[2:43:04.600 --> 2:43:08.920]  got the courage to stand up and say these things because we agree with you. Well, they might agree
[2:43:08.920 --> 2:43:14.200]  with us, but they're not saying it. So I'm going to go on fighting these people. And I believe
[2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:18.920]  that I'm going to go on winning the battle for public opinion, not just in Britain,
[2:43:18.920 --> 2:43:24.440]  but right across Europe too. And I hope act as a bit of a warning to you guys in the States as
[2:43:24.440 --> 2:43:30.440]  well, that this same phenomenon may well be starting to engulf you. Oh, it absolutely is.
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:36.680]  Two years ago, a judicial watch, a public interest law firm sued and got all this because they
[2:43:36.680 --> 2:43:43.240]  wouldn't release it through four year, but they finally did. And Bush in 2005 signed a treaty
[2:43:43.240 --> 2:43:48.600]  saying we're already part of an American Union with his private corporate board running things,
[2:43:49.240 --> 2:43:56.680]  but our national media will not talk about it. It's kind of like in 2007, the European Union
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:44:02.520]  celebrated 50 years, but I thought it wasn't founded till 2000. So you have this European
[2:44:02.520 --> 2:44:08.360]  Union by stealth through an economic agreement. And then now they admitted a union and the
[2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:15.320]  same thing's happening here, but you spoke about a huge awakening taking place. You spoke about
[2:44:15.320 --> 2:44:19.800]  the fact that if we just point out what illegitimate tyrants these people are,
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:25.320]  that they will fall. And you talk about people thanking you as if you can go out and do it alone.
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:30.280]  We have the moral high ground. We have the law on our side. We have history on our side. The
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:35.400]  problem is the bureaucracy has all the big banks and the big money that want to set up their own
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:42.360]  private global corporate government behind them. So speak specifically to the state of the world
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:48.120]  from your in-depth position as a key member of the European Union parliament from England.
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:53.240]  And tie that into Copenhagen and the open announcements by Al Gore, Gordon Brown,
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:45:00.440]  Herman von Rupe and all of them openly saying this is world government through this environmentalist
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:07.000]  tyranny. Yeah, I mean, what they do, of course, and it's a well established technique, they try
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:13.160]  and use any crisis. Now, whether it's a real crisis or whether it's a crisis of their invention,
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:21.480]  they use the crisis to extend the argument for a loss of democracy, a loss of freedom of the
[2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:27.880]  individual at the increasing global governance. And I can think of two very good examples of this.
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:33.880]  The first, of course, is the so-called war on terror. That, you know, we face a threat from
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:40.920]  Al Qaeda or whoever else it may be. And because of this, we have to give the state more power over
[2:45:40.920 --> 2:45:47.320]  our lives. And a lot of the judicial safeguards that we've enjoyed in Britain are now being
[2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:52.520]  thrown out of the window in the name of the war on terror. And they're being used against
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:56.200]  non-terrorists. And they're being used, well, of course, I mean, this is what happens, isn't it?
[2:45:56.200 --> 2:46:01.720]  You know, this is what happens is that once governments, once police forces, once they
[2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:06.920]  have these extra powers, they, of course, then use them in any way that they see fit. And I'm
[2:46:06.920 --> 2:46:14.600]  afraid that the result of this now nine year nearly war on terror is that our loss of individual
[2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:20.280]  freedoms right across the Western world is simply enormous. It's as if the terrorists of one,
[2:46:20.280 --> 2:46:26.520]  because our own politicians have used this as an excuse to get more power. Similarly,
[2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:31.640]  the same phenomenon is happening with global warming. And I mean, Al Gore, I mean, you know,
[2:46:31.640 --> 2:46:40.600]  God help us. I mean, here's a man who lost the presidential election, who has now gone on to
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:45.160]  make many millions himself. And this shouldn't be forgotten, you know, he's made many millions
[2:46:45.160 --> 2:46:52.360]  himself out of this, this, this scaremongering, frankly, absolute scaremongering over whether
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:57.800]  CO2 emissions, as he says, are inextricably leading to temperatures going up. Now, of course,
[2:46:57.800 --> 2:47:01.800]  the fact that we know the temperatures have not gone up, they've actually now gone down
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:08.120]  since 1998 or 2002, depending where you set the bar, is irrelevant. But it's now they've
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:15.560]  changed it to weather changes, climate, any changes unnatural. Well, that's right. And, you know,
[2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:20.840]  they were hooked on global warming. They say global warming less now because it's cooling.
[2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:25.480]  But, you know, anytime there's a hurricane, anytime there's a flood, anytime anything happens,
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:31.480]  we're told, this is because of CO2 emissions. And we have the amazing situation with Copenhagen,
[2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:36.040]  where, you know, we may or may not be signing up for some new ridiculous deal over the next few
[2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:43.400]  weeks. I mean, we've just, just give an example of how mad this is. We've just seen Britain's oldest
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:48.040]  steelworks up in a place called Middlesbrough in the northeast of England. That steelworks
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:54.920]  announced last week that it's closing down. In doing so, the parent company, an Indian firm
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:48:03.080]  called TASA, will be given £600 million worth of carbon credits, right, for closing down that,
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:09.240]  for closing down that plant. And then what will happen is all of that production will shift
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:13.560]  across to India, who, of course, have no intention of lifting to any of this stuff.
[2:48:13.560 --> 2:48:20.920]  I mean, in the name, in the name of fighting against carbon emissions, we're actually
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:27.160]  literally exporting jobs from our country to countries like India, which clearly makes
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:33.080]  no sense at all. And we've got a situation where we're going to be signed up to treaties, which
[2:48:33.080 --> 2:48:39.000]  means that we can't change these agreements by how we vote at future elections. Now, the whole,
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:43.800]  the whole principle of democracy, you know, whatever level it's at.
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:51.800]  Or sovereignty, sovereignty. I mean, sovereignty is all about not being dominated by some foreign
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:57.560]  offshore corporation, British East India Company or empire, but a member of parliament,
[2:48:58.280 --> 2:49:02.120]  a member of European parliament, I want you to get into this key point here in just a moment.
[2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:06.600]  But I don't want to just run over the key fact you just laid out as we go to break here.
[2:49:06.600 --> 2:49:11.480]  You just pointed out, not only are they paying them hundreds of thousands of pounds,
[2:49:11.480 --> 2:49:17.640]  hundreds of thousands, not millions of dollars, to shut a steel mill down in the UK and jobs,
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:25.080]  but when they go to India, there'll be zero emissions control. So even if you believe carbon
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:30.040]  dioxide is this murderous toxic waste chemical weapon, even if you believe that fraud and
[2:49:30.040 --> 2:49:35.160]  polar bears can't swim and all the rest of it and penguins are drowning, the most incredible
[2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:39.320]  aquatic birds there are, the ice caps are getting bigger. Even if you believe all that,
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:43.720]  this will produce more CO2 under the UN's plan is what you're saying.
[2:49:43.720 --> 2:49:51.560]  Absolutely. And you know, the other big response in Europe to this is we are building tens of
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:57.640]  thousands of these ludicrous windmills right across Europe. And we're told this is wonderful.
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:50:02.440]  This will be a wonderful source of renewable energy. Now, I'm not against the concept of renewable
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:09.000]  energy, but I'll tell you this. In Germany, they built 19,000 wind turbines, but not a single
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:13.800]  coal, oil or gas fired power station has closed down because in the depths of winter,
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:19.640]  when a big, when a big anti-site clone sits over northern Europe, not a single one of those 19,000
[2:50:19.640 --> 2:50:26.040]  wind turbines moves around and produces any electricity. Even if cutting carbon emissions
[2:50:26.040 --> 2:50:31.240]  was vital to the environment, the way we're going about it is mad, bad and wrong.
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:34.840]  Well, it's absolutely, we're going to break, we'll come back and finish the point I interrupted
[2:50:34.840 --> 2:50:40.680]  you on, but it's not a windmills fine on your house because you don't have power loss down the
[2:50:40.680 --> 2:50:48.600]  lines. I have family that works in different power stations here in Texas. You lose tons of power
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:53.480]  down line. You have to have incredible power just to get it to places. The power's too low
[2:50:53.480 --> 2:50:59.560]  from windmills to let you transfer it and transport it. So you lose most of it. It's very wasteful.
[2:50:59.560 --> 2:51:04.760]  We'll be right back. This is an emergency alert. People don't die of H1
[2:51:04.760 --> 2:51:11.000]  N1 infection. They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock. Doctors call it the cytokine

[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:16.600]  agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've determined their influence
[2:52:16.600 --> 2:52:22.360]  on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[2:52:22.360 --> 2:52:28.280]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies
[2:52:28.280 --> 2:52:34.440]  of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[2:52:34.440 --> 2:52:38.920]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[2:52:38.920 --> 2:52:43.560]  more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today it seems like nobody
[2:52:43.560 --> 2:52:50.520]  does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy

[2:54:27.160 --> 2:54:31.640]  Joining us is a very busy man. Okay, sir, I interrupted you when you were getting over the
[2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:35.960]  point about the fact that this is dictatorial. And then I wanted to ask you, are we beginning to
[2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:41.400]  get headway? Are we winning? And being around these European Union members for close to a decade,
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:46.120]  I mean, they're openly on television saying dictatorial world government. What do they
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:52.520]  say behind the scenes? Go ahead, Mr. Farage. Right. Let's just consider what the concept
[2:54:52.520 --> 2:54:59.480]  democracy is. Now, there's an old saying, an old Westminster saying, and I'm going back now
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:05.080]  to the English Civil War in the 17th century, right? And the whole point about electing people
[2:55:05.080 --> 2:55:09.640]  to our House of Commons, to our parliament in Westminster, was that no parliament
[2:55:09.640 --> 2:55:15.240]  may bind its successor. All right? Now, that may be old fashioned English, but what it actually means
[2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:21.560]  is there's nothing in a proper democratic parliament, there is nothing that one government
[2:55:21.560 --> 2:55:28.680]  or one parliament does that cannot be undone by any successive government or parliament, right?
[2:55:28.680 --> 2:55:33.960]  That's why we have elections for goodness sake. Now, the whole point about European Union, for
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:42.120]  example, is we currently face a mass of regulations that are going to do severe damage to the city
[2:55:42.120 --> 2:55:45.800]  of London, to our financial services sector where I spent 20 years of my working life.
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:50.600]  And once those regulations have gone through, it won't matter a damn whether David Cameron
[2:55:50.600 --> 2:55:55.480]  becomes the Prime Minister or Gordon Brown gets re-elected because there's nothing we can do
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:56:01.240]  as voters in Britain to change those European laws. So that is an absolute total denial of
[2:56:01.240 --> 2:56:09.480]  democracy. And it turns your parliament into a vestigial ceremonial dress of the European Union.
[2:56:09.480 --> 2:56:16.120]  Yeah. The whole thing has become a complete charade because 75% of our laws are made somewhere
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:21.400]  else. And that's before they got this new European constitutional treaty passed. And now we're told
[2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:26.680]  that even in areas like foreign policy, we can't do our own thing. We'll have to do it at a European
[2:56:26.680 --> 2:56:32.120]  level. So it is literally, it is the death, being part of a European Union, this European Union,
[2:56:32.120 --> 2:56:38.600]  is the death of democracy. I believe the very same principles apply to these agreements that
[2:56:38.600 --> 2:56:43.560]  started back at the time of Kyoto and could be coming out of Copenhagen over the next period
[2:56:43.560 --> 2:56:49.240]  of time. Because if we sign up to a seriously negative, if Obama signs up and if Britain
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:57.080]  signs up to a whole set of targets 20, 30 years hence from now, then by definition,
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:03.000]  you've broken that principle of no parliament may bind its successor. Now, of course, we're always
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:09.160]  told that, you know, we have to operate together. We have to operate at a European level or a global
[2:57:09.160 --> 2:57:15.800]  level to deal with the CO2 crisis or the war on terror or whatever else it may be. But that is
[2:57:15.800 --> 2:57:22.520]  a complete denial of democracy. And I've been fighting and making these points. And during the
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:28.360]  last few years, we've had the French in a referendum saying no. We've had the Dutch in a referendum
[2:57:28.360 --> 2:57:34.040]  saying no. We've had the Irish in a referendum saying no. The British, of course, who were promised
[2:57:34.040 --> 2:57:39.640]  referendums all the way through have just been denied them. But as I start to make these arguments,
[2:57:39.640 --> 2:57:47.320]  I can see the fear in the eyes of the leaders of this European Union project. I sit on the front
[2:57:47.320 --> 2:57:52.440]  bench of this parliament. I'm literally within feet of these people that are doing this to our
[2:57:52.440 --> 2:57:57.000]  democracy. And I can see the fear in their eyes when I make these arguments, because they know
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:02.760]  what I'm saying is right. And their response to me has been truly extraordinary. And the
[2:58:02.760 --> 2:58:08.600]  eclipse that you could find on the EU parliament website, I've been called mentally ill because
[2:58:08.600 --> 2:58:12.840]  of what I stand for, which of course is very reminiscent, isn't it? Well, they've said you're
[2:58:12.840 --> 2:58:17.640]  a naked monkey up in a tree. And then when you try to defend yourself, you're told you can't
[2:58:17.640 --> 2:58:27.800]  name call. So it's, I mean, it's like some Kafka-esque Soviet apparatchik court where it's
[2:58:27.800 --> 2:58:33.960]  la-la land. They can call you names, but you can't have free speech. You can't criticize the EU,
[2:58:33.960 --> 2:58:39.480]  but they can call you a naked monkey. By the way, that clip is coming up. Stay there. Nigel Farage
[2:58:39.480 --> 2:58:48.280]  is our guest. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:52.680 --> 2:58:56.680]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:58:56.680 --> 2:59:01.640]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[2:59:01.640 --> 2:59:07.080]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:12.280]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the
[2:59:12.280 --> 2:59:18.120]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the
[2:59:18.120 --> 2:59:23.960]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale
[2:59:23.960 --> 2:59:30.200]  of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs
[2:59:30.200 --> 2:59:35.320]  Generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production
[2:59:35.320 --> 2:59:42.440]  fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[2:59:42.440 --> 2:59:59.240]  of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:59.240 --> 3:00:16.040]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones
[3:00:16.040 --> 3:00:22.520]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:31.960]  Nigel Farage is our guest UK member of the European Union Parliament, the leader of opposition to the
[3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:41.000]  New World Order in government in Europe. This is the man who is eloquently every week standing
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:45.640]  up to these people. Now they just turn his mic off, call him names, and then don't let him respond.
[3:00:46.360 --> 3:00:51.320]  The United Nations all over Copenhagen has their armed police on the streets declaring in a UN zone
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:58.440]  at accredited press events. If you ask Al Gore or the IPCC head about Climate Gate, you are drug
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:05.080]  out at gunpoint. I mean, these are authoritarians. These are the children of Joe Stalin, of Mao
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:11.800]  Sateung, of Adolf Hitler. And when I say that, I mean it. I've watched them. They want control,
[3:01:11.800 --> 3:01:16.920]  and they want to squash all dissent. Nigel Farage, you've been around them for nine years with these
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:24.280]  vipers. How would you describe them? They are truly dreadful people. And I don't by that mean I
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:29.400]  disagree with their point of view. They are truly dreadful people. They will stop at nothing
[3:01:29.400 --> 3:01:35.080]  to get their goal. I remember a little anecdote. On the night of the Dutch referendum a few years
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:40.520]  ago on the EU constitution, and the result came out and two thirds of the Dutch have said, no,
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:47.800]  we don't want this. And I was with about 50 skeptics in the European Parliament, in the member's bar,
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:52.920]  having a bit of a party, celebrating what I hoped would be the triumph of democracy over
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:59.880]  bureaucracy. And at that moment, a German MEP, a guy called Mr. Leinem, walked past me. And he'd
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:04.760]  be one of the authors of this constitution. And I said to him, oh, Joe, I said, do you want to
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:10.680]  join us for a drink to celebrate the democracy in the Netherlands? And he looked at me. He said,
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:15.720]  no, I won't accept your drink. He said, in any way, you enjoy your little victories at night.
[3:02:15.720 --> 3:02:21.000]  He said, we have 50 different ways to win. And it was chilling because it just about
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  summed it up. There is literally nothing that will stop these people from achieving their goal
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:33.720]  by our fanatics. You know, we got rid of Mussolini and Hitler. We got rid of what was seen to be
[3:02:33.720 --> 3:02:38.360]  those extreme nationalisms. Well, we've got a new one now, and it's called the European Union,
[3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:43.560]  and it's every bit as dangerous as those things that went before. I was reading the Treaty of Rome
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:50.520]  in 1957 that really established the EU. It states that by stealth. And they talk about, oh, we've
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:57.240]  learned from Napoleon and Hitler not to do this militarily. We're going to do this via bureaucracy
[3:02:57.240 --> 3:03:05.000]  and taxation and creeping. This is a premeditated system funded by mega rich that want monopolies
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:11.400]  using communists as their henchmen who just want a piece of the middle classes pie. I mean,
[3:03:11.400 --> 3:03:17.880]  this is a truly piratical group from my study who know their criminal. I mean, this is a very
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:24.440]  wicked group. How many of them are just true acolytes who believe in collectivism and how many
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:29.960]  of them are true pirates? Well, that's always a tough one to answer, but I can tell you. I mean,
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:35.000]  you know, we've had for the last five years one of the European commissioners, a man from Hungary,
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:41.720]  Mr. Kovacs, who was for many, many years the right hand man of the dictator, Mr. Kadar,
[3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:46.120]  in Hungary, a fully paid up member of the Soviet Communist Party. He's been an EU commissioner
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:58.040]  for the last five years. Sir, can you start over something cut out your phone line? Go back to
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:06.840]  the communist commissars now in the EU. Yeah, of the 27 EU commissioners that we have now,
[3:04:06.840 --> 3:04:10.840]  and these are the people with the real power in Europe, they're not elected, they're appointed,
[3:04:10.840 --> 3:04:15.720]  but these are the people who have the sole right to propose legislation that is effective in all
[3:04:15.720 --> 3:04:23.160]  our countries. Six of those work directly for the Soviet communist regime before the war came down,
[3:04:23.960 --> 3:04:28.920]  and that isn't going to improve particularly because we've got Mr. von Rompuy, who's going to
[3:04:28.920 --> 3:04:34.440]  take over as the European president, but the new foreign minister that's taking over is a lady
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:42.360]  called Baroness Ashton from Britain, and from 1980 to 82, she was the treasurer of the campaign for
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:49.640]  nuclear disarmament in Britain, a campaign that wanted us to unilaterally disarm, and an organization
[3:04:49.640 --> 3:04:53.960]  that would directly have received a fund from the Communist Party of Great Britain. Stay there,
[3:04:54.600 --> 3:04:59.880]  stay there Nigel Farage, I'm a member of parliament, we have that clip of where you confront them,
[3:04:59.880 --> 3:05:06.200]  coming up we'll go right. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone,
[3:05:06.200 --> 3:05:10.920]  this is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[3:05:10.920 --> 3:05:14.520]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:05:14.520 --> 3:05:20.600]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:05:20.600 --> 3:05:25.880]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:05:25.880 --> 3:05:31.640]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[3:05:31.640 --> 3:05:36.760]  bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[3:05:36.760 --> 3:05:41.080]  Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying,
[3:05:41.080 --> 3:05:45.720]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington,
[3:05:45.720 --> 3:05:52.760]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[3:06:01.400 --> 3:06:06.120]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[3:06:06.120 --> 3:06:10.840]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[3:06:10.840 --> 3:06:16.120]  all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only
[3:06:16.120 --> 3:06:21.400]  ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will
[3:06:21.400 --> 3:06:25.960]  you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it
[3:06:25.960 --> 3:06:30.360]  make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the
[3:06:30.360 --> 3:06:35.960]  gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:06:35.960 --> 3:06:41.480]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[3:06:41.480 --> 3:06:46.840]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live

[3:08:24.120 --> 3:08:25.880]  Global Voice
[3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:31.000]  But I'm afraid the leaders have suffered from a collective loss of nerve. They've decided that
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:35.880]  they want their faces to be up on the global stage, not somebody from the European Union,
[3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:42.200]  and so we've got appointed a couple of political pygmies. The Kissinger question
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:47.240]  of who to call in Europe hasn't really been answered, has it? I guess the answer can only be
[3:08:47.240 --> 3:08:52.200]  Mr. Barroso, because he's the only one that anybody in the world has ever heard of,
[3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:57.800]  and is probably the big winner out of these posts. No wonder, sir, you look so happy this morning.
[3:08:59.640 --> 3:09:05.640]  And we have a new president of Europe, Herman van Rompuy. Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue,
[3:09:05.640 --> 3:09:12.920]  does it? I can't see him stopping the traffic in Beijing or Washington. I doubt anybody in
[3:09:12.920 --> 3:09:19.480]  Brussels would even recognize who he is, and yet he's going to be paid a salary that is bigger
[3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:24.520]  than Obama's, which tells you all you need to know about this European political class
[3:09:24.520 --> 3:09:30.200]  and how they look after themselves. But at least he's an elected politician unlike
[3:09:30.200 --> 3:09:35.800]  Baroness Cathy Ashton, who really is the true representation of the modern day political
[3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:40.760]  class. In some way, she's ideal, isn't she? She's never had a proper job, and she's never
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:45.880]  been elected to anything in her life. So I guess she's perfect for this European Union.
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:53.480]  Excuse me, Mr Farage, I would like to put down your postages. You made your presentation
[3:09:53.480 --> 3:10:00.280]  is enough for us. Okay, please continue. But I mean, she's never been elected to anything,
[3:10:00.280 --> 3:10:05.800]  and no one knows who she is. Even the Prime Minister was talking about Baroness Ashton,
[3:10:05.800 --> 3:10:11.640]  as opposed to Ashton. I mean, no one has ever heard of her. She's even less well known
[3:10:11.640 --> 3:10:17.160]  than Herman Van Rompuy. I mean, that takes some doing, doesn't it? She's risen without trace.
[3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:23.960]  She's part of this post-democratic age. She married well. She married an advisor and a friend
[3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:29.160]  and supporter of Tony Blair and got put in the House of Lords. When she was in the House of Lords,
[3:10:29.160 --> 3:10:34.360]  she was given one big job. And the job was to get the Lisbon Treaty through the House of Lords
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:42.600]  and to do so pretending that it was entirely different to the EU constitution. So she's
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:48.600]  good at keeping a straight face. And she vigorously crushed any attempt in the House of Lords for
[3:10:48.600 --> 3:10:53.000]  the British people. There you go. He's about five feet from her, telling her to her face.
[3:10:53.640 --> 3:10:58.440]  Then the current head, the sitting chair of the EU, shuts him down, tells him to shut up,
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:05.720]  and then turns his mic off and cuts to the head of the Poland delegation to call him a
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:10.920]  bare-butted monkey. And then they tell him, you're not allowed to call names, which he's
[3:11:10.920 --> 3:11:16.440]  not doing. He's exposing their fraud. But then we're allowed to call you names. European Union
[3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:22.440]  Member of Parliament from the UK or UEP, Nigel Farage, is our guest. Thank you so much for
[3:11:22.440 --> 3:11:27.320]  being on with us, sir. Tell us about that little exchange because it continues on for some time.
[3:11:27.320 --> 3:11:34.200]  It's up on the UK Independence Party website, UKIP.org. If folks want to see the full 30 minutes
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:40.760]  of it. It's a classic exchange. I mean, okay, you know, my tone may be somewhat cutting or
[3:11:40.760 --> 3:11:48.600]  biting or sarcastic, but I didn't say anything that wasn't 100% true. And I didn't use language
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:56.040]  that was abusive or wrong or foul. I merely pointed out that Mr. von Rompuy was a bureaucrat,
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:12:01.800]  and that Baroness Ashton had had these very worrying links, in my opinion, with the campaign
[3:12:01.800 --> 3:12:07.400]  for nuclear disarmament, which was being funded by the Soviets. And for that, I was told by the
[3:12:07.400 --> 3:12:12.680]  President of the European Parliament that what I'd said was unacceptable, but it simply wasn't
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:18.680]  right that I should behave in this way. And whilst I was speaking, I was being cheered
[3:12:18.680 --> 3:12:22.600]  and barred for abuse. I mean, that always happens now, every time I get up to speak.
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:26.440]  Yeah, we can hear lots of chanting, but we can't make it out. I mean, were they just hissing
[3:12:26.440 --> 3:12:31.240]  and cussing or? Yeah, they shout and they scream and all the rest of it. But I mean, I guess all
[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:35.640]  that you, you know, what you really get from the microphone is me, but no, they're always very
[3:12:35.640 --> 3:12:41.480]  abusive towards me. But it's perfectly okay for them to say that I'm mentally ill. It's perfectly
[3:12:41.480 --> 3:12:47.880]  okay for them to call me a monkey. It's fine for them to say that if people support Mr. Farage,
[3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:54.040]  it will open the door to fascism. I mean, they can, you know, there is no term of abuse that
[3:12:54.040 --> 3:12:59.800]  these people will not sink to, to battle against those of us that are arguing for democracy and
[3:12:59.800 --> 3:13:04.760]  are arguing for people to have their own voice and to say what they want to say. And in fact,
[3:13:04.760 --> 3:13:10.520]  after that, after that exchange, I was called up to meet the President of the Parliament at
[3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:15.720]  five o'clock that night. And it reminded me of being in trouble at school and having to go and
[3:13:15.720 --> 3:13:23.640]  see the headmaster, you know, you wait outside the study and I went in and I said, look, I said,
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:29.720]  there's nothing I said or did here that could be deemed to be unparliamentary or wrong in any way
[3:13:29.720 --> 3:13:37.640]  at all. Was there Mr. President? And he said, well, you called them pigmits. And I had trouble not
[3:13:37.640 --> 3:13:42.760]  laughing or wetting myself. I said, but surely, you know, to call people pigmits, I mean, I said,
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:47.720]  they're not exactly giants, are they? I said, in future, I'll call them lino-putians if that makes
[3:13:47.720 --> 3:13:53.720]  you happy. You know, when it came to it, there was nothing they could say, I am not abusive,
[3:13:53.720 --> 3:13:59.640]  I am not foul mouth, I am not rude, and I'm 100% factual. And it reminds me, Alex, of a time five
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:05.800]  years ago, when I revealed to the Parliament that the French Commissioner had in fact been convicted
[3:14:05.800 --> 3:14:11.560]  of embezzlement in the year 2000. Yeah. And I revealed this to the Parliament. Well, it was
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:17.480]  like a hand grenade had gone off. They all stood up and they abused me and point of order after
[3:14:17.480 --> 3:14:24.200]  point of order was made. The Parliament was told, wasn't it terrible that Mr. Farage had behaved
[3:14:24.200 --> 3:14:29.320]  like this? Somebody else said I'd behaved like a football hooligan, which I took real exception to.
[3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:35.320]  I was told by the then president of the Parliament that I should withdraw my statement
[3:14:35.320 --> 3:14:43.000]  so that it could be expunged from the record or face the full legal ramifications of what I'd just
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:48.760]  done. And of course, nothing happened because it was entirely true. The bloke had been convicted
[3:14:48.760 --> 3:14:55.320]  of embezzlement. But this is what you're up against here. Continually, they throw the abuse at us
[3:14:55.320 --> 3:15:02.520]  and we fight back with that. European Union Member of Parliament from the U.K., Nigel Farage
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:07.880]  is our guest. I want to skip ahead in the 30 minutes that this went on to just one of the people
[3:15:07.880 --> 3:15:12.680]  on Mike where he's telling you you're not allowed to criticize them, but that he doesn't tell her
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:19.880]  she's wrong for calling you a monkey, the taller you climb up the tree, the more your butt is
[3:15:19.880 --> 3:15:28.520]  exposed. Here is the clip from the commissar from Poland. Here it is. Save their integrity,
[3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:34.360]  personal integrity. And Mr. Farage, I'd like to say something Hungarian quotation for you.
[3:15:34.360 --> 3:15:37.800]  It's good that you are here because if the monkey goes up to the tree,
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:40.120]  it's better seen how that is his popo.
[3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:51.800]  What could you say? They can call me what they like. I don't care. They can call me what they
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:57.640]  like. You know, if they think they're really helping their cause by just throwing continual
[3:15:57.640 --> 3:16:02.280]  abuse at me, they're wrong. They're doing it because they're frightened. And what they're
[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:07.960]  frightened of is that the majority of people in Britain and France and Germany and right across
[3:16:07.960 --> 3:16:13.960]  Europe, the vast majority of them want to live in democratic nation states. They do not want this.
[3:16:13.960 --> 3:16:17.400]  Absolutely. I mean, the statements you're making, I mean, you're clearly in the right,
[3:16:17.400 --> 3:16:23.480]  all of us for liberty and sovereignty and true free republics, representative democracy,
[3:16:23.480 --> 3:16:27.400]  we're in the right, they're in the wrong. And for decades, when we would try to cover
[3:16:27.400 --> 3:16:32.680]  the plan for the European Union to go global, when we would read official UN documents calling
[3:16:32.680 --> 3:16:37.640]  for global government, global governance, the media would call us cooks and nuts trying to
[3:16:37.640 --> 3:16:41.720]  keep people from having a real debate. But now that their system's out in the open,
[3:16:41.720 --> 3:16:46.360]  it's actually backfired on them because hundreds of millions of people have learned about the
[3:16:46.360 --> 3:16:52.040]  New World Order were told it didn't exist. Now they're admitting it exists, but saying it's good.
[3:16:52.040 --> 3:16:57.320]  And you talk about the fear in their eyes. I'm seeing that here. And they beg us. They go,
[3:16:57.320 --> 3:17:01.000]  please don't talk about how we're tyrants. Please don't talk about how we're undemocratic.
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:05.400]  Please don't talk about how we're robbing people and want socialism. Please, please,
[3:17:05.400 --> 3:17:10.920]  please, because people will think you're a cook. No, they're begging us not to stand up against
[3:17:10.920 --> 3:17:17.160]  them. Your comments on that. Well, we've got to stand up and fight. There's a fantastic quotation
[3:17:17.160 --> 3:17:21.320]  from a guy called Burke who was an English philosopher. And he wrote, and again, it's
[3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:26.120]  17th century stuff, but, but often these old principles remain good. And he wrote that all
[3:17:26.120 --> 3:17:31.240]  it takes for evil to prosper is for good men to do nothing. And I would put it to you, Alex,
[3:17:31.240 --> 3:17:34.920]  and I would put it to your audience that what is actually happening in terms of democracy
[3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:41.080]  and sovereignty around the Western world is nothing short of evil. And it's our duty to stand up
[3:17:41.080 --> 3:17:45.560]  and fight for this. You know, those that went before us in previous generations, you know,
[3:17:46.440 --> 3:17:52.680]  they had to fight it out in muddy trenches in northern France. And in many cases give up their
[3:17:52.680 --> 3:17:59.880]  lives to have democracy, freedom and self-respect. What we're being called upon to do is nothing
[3:17:59.880 --> 3:18:04.440]  like as an irksome or as difficult as that, but we have to stand up and do it. And I'm pleased
[3:18:04.440 --> 3:18:08.120]  to say that increasingly on this side of the pond, people are beginning to do so.
[3:18:08.680 --> 3:18:12.440]  Well, I don't want to take away from World War II veterans and people, amazing folks,
[3:18:12.440 --> 3:18:20.600]  but I've read a lot of psychology perspective on this. And sometimes it's harder to morally stand up
[3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:29.480]  against a political system when the political system is advertising itself as the only orthodoxy.
[3:18:29.480 --> 3:18:35.480]  Sometimes moral courage is harder than when you know people are shooting at you and everybody's on
[3:18:35.480 --> 3:18:40.280]  your side, on your side, and they're on their side and you're fighting. That's a lot cleaner and more
[3:18:40.280 --> 3:18:44.760]  focused and you know what you're dealing with. Dealing with the duplicity of, you know, as you
[3:18:44.760 --> 3:18:50.920]  said, this German member of the EU said, look, we'll just beat you 50 underhanded ways. I mean,
[3:18:50.920 --> 3:18:57.240]  it's the fact that it's a covert operation that we're countering. And so what can people do in
[3:18:57.240 --> 3:19:03.160]  the UK, because you talked about your party just exploding? How do folks get behind the UK
[3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:08.120]  Independence Party? How do people from your own perspective become leaders against the
[3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:15.000]  New World Order, against this global group of tyrants who are networked on a planetary scale?
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:20.600]  From your experience, what can people do in Texas and in England and in Germany and all over the
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:26.040]  world? Well, at the end of the day, however much our democracies have been devalued and they have,
[3:19:26.040 --> 3:19:30.440]  and however much our freedoms have been taken away from us, which they have, but still at the end
[3:19:30.440 --> 3:19:35.880]  of the day, we do have a system where the people that have the power to commit these things have
[3:19:35.880 --> 3:19:43.640]  to be voted in by us. All right? So the ultimate power, short of rioting, you know, I hope you
[3:19:43.640 --> 3:19:49.880]  won't get to that, but the ultimate power that we have over the political class is the ability to
[3:19:49.880 --> 3:19:56.440]  get rid of them, is the ability for them to lose their positions. And, you know, that's why, okay,
[3:19:56.440 --> 3:20:03.560]  it's taken time. These things don't happen overnight. And your point of, that's that. And that is a
[3:20:03.560 --> 3:20:09.240]  perfectly good point. But increasingly, what we're finding in England is that people are gaining
[3:20:09.240 --> 3:20:15.080]  the confidence and are feeling that they've got to speak out, not just because it's a moral duty,
[3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:20.440]  but also because, you know, anyone that's got children and grandchildren can surely see the
[3:20:20.440 --> 3:20:25.480]  lessons of history. And the lessons of history are clear. If you force people, as we're doing in
[3:20:25.480 --> 3:20:30.840]  Europe, to live in a different state under a different form of government over which they
[3:20:30.840 --> 3:20:36.840]  have no effective control, that is a recipe in the future, not for peace, but for civil disorder
[3:20:36.840 --> 3:20:43.320]  and possibly even for war. So we are beginning to see people showing the courage, breaking out
[3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:49.800]  of their normal tribal party political lines. And they'll come a point, they'll come a point
[3:20:49.800 --> 3:20:55.880]  where UKIP becomes so big that something will give in our political system. But it's having the
[3:20:55.880 --> 3:21:00.840]  it's having the willingness to take away from those politicians the one thing they need, which is your
[3:21:00.840 --> 3:21:07.640]  vote at election time. Well, that's a great point. And then obviously, every man and woman listening
[3:21:07.640 --> 3:21:13.480]  to your voice across the globe, or on satellite, shortwave internet, AM and FM stations all over
[3:21:13.480 --> 3:21:18.520]  North America needs to understand that none of us are going to save the world overnight. It's
[3:21:18.520 --> 3:21:25.080]  everybody doing a little bit to educate someone, to explain to them about the unelected tyranny
[3:21:25.080 --> 3:21:33.080]  of this global corporate system that's been set up. And to understand that, as you pointed out,
[3:21:33.720 --> 3:21:40.840]  Mr. Farage, that every generation has to face tyranny. And the tyranny we're facing is cloaked
[3:21:40.840 --> 3:21:48.680]  in respectability, cloaked in Madison Avenue, public relations propaganda, but is even more
[3:21:48.680 --> 3:21:54.360]  deadly than some of the past corruptions that we've dealt with, and that people had better get
[3:21:54.360 --> 3:21:59.640]  moving against this now. Yes, they've got to get mobilized. And your point is right, that
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:09.160]  really successful revolutions happen. And real, real momentum happens by many tens of thousands
[3:22:09.160 --> 3:22:13.640]  of little things happening. And, you know, it's people talking to each other at the golf club
[3:22:13.640 --> 3:22:18.200]  or in the local bar or wherever they go and meet people or, you know, over Sunday lunch with the
[3:22:18.200 --> 3:22:23.480]  family. It's lots of little conversations that develop momentum and make a real difference.
[3:22:23.480 --> 3:22:30.680]  And I'm absolutely convinced of that. And I'm also convinced that across the Western world,
[3:22:30.680 --> 3:22:36.200]  there has never been less confidence in our traditional career politicians. So I think the
[3:22:36.200 --> 3:22:40.680]  mood is ripe for it. And I think that people are beginning to realize that this stuff is now
[3:22:40.680 --> 3:22:46.440]  affecting them directly. I mean, look, whatever they sign up to in Copenhagen next week affects
[3:22:46.440 --> 3:22:50.920]  every man and woman in England and in the USA, because what they're going to do is they're
[3:22:50.920 --> 3:22:56.600]  going to tax us more and continue to export our jobs to India and places like that. So I think
[3:22:56.600 --> 3:23:01.480]  this stuff is beginning to hit home. I think it's why we're beginning to win the argument.
[3:23:01.480 --> 3:23:06.760]  But I mean, hey, there's no room for complacency. We've got a long, long way to go yet.
[3:23:06.760 --> 3:23:12.840]  Absolutely. They can't win unless we just sit down and shut up because they always create the crisis
[3:23:12.840 --> 3:23:18.280]  or use a crisis to get more power. The crisis gets worse than they use that to get more power.
[3:23:18.280 --> 3:23:23.000]  If we just point out that they are the main progenitors of our deindustrialization,
[3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:30.120]  the dependency, the welfare, the open borders, all the problems, there's no way they can stand
[3:23:30.120 --> 3:23:34.920]  if we just stand up like the little boy saying the emperor is wearing no clothes.
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:38.840]  In closing, in the last five, six minutes we have left, and we're very appreciative
[3:23:38.840 --> 3:23:45.240]  in your busy schedule, sir, specifically with the Copenhagen greenhouse gas initiative,
[3:23:45.240 --> 3:23:50.360]  it looks like this agreement's falling through, but they will agree to meet again in Mexico City.
[3:23:50.360 --> 3:23:57.240]  And Obama has said, I don't care if Senate won't ratify. I'm going to implement through
[3:23:57.240 --> 3:24:03.320]  the bureaucracy. Same thing, Gordon Brown and Tony have done with EU expansion.
[3:24:03.320 --> 3:24:09.800]  How do you counter the lawlessness of the bureaucracies, of the prime ministers, of the
[3:24:09.800 --> 3:24:16.360]  presidents, and their bureaucracies, who don't care even when the elected bodies do the right thing?
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:21.400]  I'm afraid, I remember very well when Obama was elected, and it was seen in England,
[3:24:21.400 --> 3:24:24.920]  like the second coming of the Lord, you know, all the media wasn't it wonderful,
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:31.000]  and I was on a big TV show, and I was asked my opinion, and I said I was very concerned about
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:35.560]  many of the things that Obama stood for, and I was somewhat vilified at the time for that,
[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:43.640]  but I think Obama's response to Copenhagen, I think Obama's attitude towards your own
[3:24:43.640 --> 3:24:49.960]  parliamentary bodies is quite extraordinary, and I think this marks Obama out to be,
[3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:56.040]  frankly, and I don't come on this show to offend Americans, but I honestly think that Obama is
[3:24:56.040 --> 3:25:04.040]  a very dangerous man who doesn't really truly believe in democracy, and I would have thought
[3:25:04.040 --> 3:25:08.920]  that if this is how he's going to behave as American president, then it is your duty as
[3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:13.640]  Americans if you believe in democracy, and if you believe as I believe in the principle that,
[3:25:13.640 --> 3:25:18.760]  you know, no parliament may bind its successor, and the job of parliaments is to hold the executive
[3:25:18.760 --> 3:25:23.240]  in your case, the president, to account, then you've got to jolly well make sure that he doesn't
[3:25:23.240 --> 3:25:29.000]  get reelected for a second term, it's just as simple as that. Absolutely, in the three and a
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:34.040]  half minutes we've got left, sir, I just want to encourage people to go to ukip.org,
[3:25:34.600 --> 3:25:40.520]  ukindependenceparty.org, and learn a lot more, and certainly set up our own sovereignty groups
[3:25:40.520 --> 3:25:46.120]  outside of the Republicans, because just as Mr. Farage talks about both the big parties, Labor
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:50.920]  and Tories being controlled over in England, our two parties are controlled. Obviously,
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:55.000]  things are moving quicker right now under Obama than they would have under a Republican
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:26:01.400]  administration, but regardless, it's Tweedledee and Tweedledum, everybody needs to mobilize,
[3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:06.440]  as Lord Monkton's talked about, a worldwide freedom party in every nation, saying we want
[3:26:06.440 --> 3:26:11.080]  sovereignty, we want free market, we don't want to be run by a bunch of bureaucrats.
[3:26:11.080 --> 3:26:16.600]  In closing, sir, any other points you'd like to make, any other information you'd like to relay
[3:26:16.600 --> 3:26:22.520]  about EU expansion, one question I had, I saw press reports about multiple nations are threatening
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:30.920]  to pull out of the EU. So the EU is collapsing, even as it tyrannically expands its labor struggle.
[3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:35.080]  Yeah, I mean, just at the very point where they get their constitutional treaty through,
[3:26:35.080 --> 3:26:38.600]  where they get their president, where they get their foreign minister, where they get
[3:26:38.600 --> 3:26:43.480]  total power over the member states, even at this very point, it's becoming clear that the
[3:26:43.480 --> 3:26:48.280]  electorates of the member states don't want it. It's becoming clear that countries like Greece
[3:26:48.280 --> 3:26:53.000]  and Ireland, which mistakenly joined the monetary system and took the euro as their currency,
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:58.200]  now find themselves in an impossible position with nothing to do. And I would just say this,
[3:26:58.760 --> 3:27:04.280]  you know, if you look through history, there is no example of any free people willingly
[3:27:04.280 --> 3:27:09.000]  giving up the right to govern itself. And yet what has happened to us in England is we have
[3:27:09.000 --> 3:27:15.080]  been betrayed by labor and conservative politicians, successively over the last 40 years,
[3:27:15.080 --> 3:27:20.920]  to the point where our parliament has become nothing more than a charade. And I will go on
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:26.280]  fighting and I will go on standing up because I believe that the best people to govern Britain
[3:27:26.280 --> 3:27:31.560]  are the British people themselves. And I want my four kids to grow up in a country that they can
[3:27:31.560 --> 3:27:36.920]  call their own. And I believe this is a great historic battle, and we are going to win this
[3:27:36.920 --> 3:27:42.840]  battle. Well, sir, obviously, you're all over radio and TV in the UK. You don't need much of our
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:48.040]  help, but we do have a large internet audience and satellite audience in the UK. Specifically,
[3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:52.760]  there's a lot of folks probably never got involved in politics, but they're now,
[3:27:52.760 --> 3:27:56.120]  how can people help you get elected to the UK parliament?
[3:27:56.120 --> 3:28:03.880]  If they want to help me in any way they can, go to UKIP.org, go to our website, register with us,
[3:28:03.880 --> 3:28:08.600]  and say to yourself, say to yourself that you're going to give a little bit, just a little bit,
[3:28:08.600 --> 3:28:13.160]  of your time and money to fight to get the independence, the sovereignty, the self-respect
[3:28:13.160 --> 3:28:18.360]  and pride of the United Kingdom back. As I said earlier, the sacrifice I'm asking you to make
[3:28:18.360 --> 3:28:23.080]  is of nothing compared with that your grandfathers and great-grandfathers had to make in two world
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:28.280]  wars. We're doing this because it's right. We're doing this because we've been led up the garden
[3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:33.560]  path and totally betrayed by our politicians. This is the fight back. It's real. It's happening.
[3:28:33.560 --> 3:28:38.920]  Get on board. Well, it was Cicero who said that, to paraphrase, the enemy that comes to your gate
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:45.800]  openly with their banners is not the real threat. It's the traitor within who knows your language,
[3:28:45.800 --> 3:28:53.240]  who knows your customs. And so again, whereas machine guns firing at our ancestors was a terrible
[3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:58.600]  thing and they were very noble to fight, it's this creeping death that's so hard to deal with.
[3:28:58.600 --> 3:29:04.120]  I think people should give a lot because if we allow the scientific dictatorship as the UN calls
[3:29:04.120 --> 3:29:10.120]  itself and many of its documents to continue to grow and put its police state grid in, they know
[3:29:10.120 --> 3:29:14.920]  people are going to revolt and resist. They're racing to get their system in place to oppress
[3:29:14.920 --> 3:29:23.240]  the people. And thanks to leaders like yourself, Nigel Farage, the UK member of the EU Parliament,
[3:29:23.240 --> 3:29:28.040]  we have a fighting chance because we know you there and Airstrip One are on the front lines
[3:29:28.040 --> 3:29:33.320]  against Europe who is setting up this planetary world government, this dictatorship. So again,
[3:29:33.320 --> 3:29:38.440]  UKIP.org. Let me say bye to you during the break. We'll let you go, sir. But thank you very much
[3:29:38.440 --> 3:29:44.520]  for spending time with us. Thank you. Not at all. Not at all. Extremely powerful. UKIP.org. Get

[3:31:03.720 --> 3:31:08.840]  buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[3:31:08.840 --> 3:31:14.040]  your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[3:31:14.040 --> 3:31:19.080]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of
[3:31:19.080 --> 3:31:24.200]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is
[3:31:24.200 --> 3:31:29.480]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:31:29.480 --> 3:31:34.600]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families
[3:31:34.600 --> 3:31:39.160]  lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[3:31:39.160 --> 3:31:43.800]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I really believe in the solar power generators

[3:32:03.480 --> 3:32:07.880]  questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[3:32:07.880 --> 3:32:13.240]  how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and
[3:32:13.240 --> 3:32:18.360]  the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you
[3:32:18.360 --> 3:32:23.320]  want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[3:32:23.320 --> 3:32:28.280]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine
[3:32:28.280 --> 3:32:33.080]  and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[3:32:33.080 --> 3:32:38.760]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[3:32:38.760 --> 3:32:43.800]  and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[3:32:43.800 --> 3:32:52.280]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633

[3:33:30.200 --> 3:33:33.320]  of Cutting to the Matrix, is going to be joining us in the next hour.
[3:33:34.760 --> 3:33:39.560]  We're going to set him up for a full two hours early in the new year. I'm a little
[3:33:39.560 --> 3:33:50.280]  tripped out right now to use the 80s term. I'm tripping as the guys would say over a big national
[3:33:50.280 --> 3:33:55.640]  TV host says they're coming. I talked to them yesterday, talked to their producer, coming here
[3:33:55.640 --> 3:34:00.440]  to interview me face to face. We're having a lot of globalists come through the office lately,
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:08.120]  and they have finally recognized that I am creeping through Mordor with the ring towards,
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:13.640]  well, through Sirith-Ungle and towards Mount Doom itself.
[3:34:13.640 --> 3:34:23.000]  I've always enjoyed, I've never really liked being on national TV or never liked really
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:27.720]  having them figure it out. I mean, I know their operatives already know it, their assessors know
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:32.360]  it, but we're actually getting the attention of all the old men and the old globalists now.
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:37.880]  They're like, I want you to go find that boy as Achilles Hill and destroy him.
[3:34:37.880 --> 3:34:47.720]  But it doesn't work anymore. When the national media attacks me, no matter how bad it is,
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:55.000]  people know the media is a bunch of lying, corrupt thugs, and so it'll be good.
[3:34:56.360 --> 3:35:00.680]  But they can't help it. They don't understand. They're like shooting a gun at me that's empty.
[3:35:00.680 --> 3:35:09.160]  They're like, die, die, die, holding the trigger and it's not working. I'm going, you're out of
[3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:18.120]  bullets there. I'd be scared of the national media coming out and saying I was good. If they were
[3:35:18.120 --> 3:35:25.800]  really smart, that's how they'd defeat me. They would just come out and say, oh, Alex Jones is
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:29.640]  good. Oh, yes, and then try to co-op the message. They're smart. They're doing that with Glenn
[3:35:29.640 --> 3:35:34.920]  Beck. They create a clown who for most people comes off as disingenuous and sneaky and like
[3:35:34.920 --> 3:35:38.600]  some kind of pervert. I mean, if I look at Glenn Beck, that's what he comes off as.
[3:35:39.160 --> 3:35:43.160]  Like if I had a neighbor like that, I'd tell my kids, hey, when you're playing people's
[3:35:43.160 --> 3:35:48.440]  front yards, if he's in the garage working on his car, don't go, that's creepy. That neighbor's
[3:35:48.440 --> 3:35:54.680]  creepy. Well, why daddy? He just looks creepy. If he's offering you soda pop, I'm sorry.
[3:35:54.680 --> 3:36:03.160]  I'm not saying Glenn Beck's like that. I just, he comes off as, well, I mean, he's always like
[3:36:04.680 --> 3:36:11.160]  on a show. He's like, always trying to act non-threatening and sweet and he's the teacher
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:16.840]  who's going to show you. And I'm like, ladies and gentlemen, look out for that guy. That's all.
[3:36:16.840 --> 3:36:21.800]  I mean, where is your discernment? All right. I'm, I'm now digressing and I have all this news to
[3:36:21.800 --> 3:36:31.000]  cover. But see, they don't know how to deal with me because I got all my problems. I'm not perfect.
[3:36:31.720 --> 3:36:37.320]  I'm a little bit hickish, a little bit hillbilly-ish, all that, but I'm real. And they don't know how
[3:36:37.320 --> 3:36:42.840]  to deal with that. They don't know how to deal with somebody. They can't buy off who doesn't
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:51.000]  really have any skeletons in my closet. Well, I eat too much and like beer. Don't even do that
[3:36:51.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  anymore. I mean, there's really nothing and they may manufacture stuff, but I'm not worried. I'll
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:01.640]  be like, use it. Say, oh, whatever you want about me, I'll use the attention to expose you're a
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:06.760]  bunch of frauds. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm so committed. All they can do is plant drugs on me or kill me.
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:11.720]  And that's not going to work either. Cause then everybody'll go, my gosh, it is for real.
[3:37:13.880 --> 3:37:18.680]  And the other good news about all this is, is that we've reached so many people in the system
[3:37:18.680 --> 3:37:24.040]  that a lot of police, a lot of military, a lot of FBI people, a lot of federal marshals,
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:29.080]  they know we're telling the truth. They heard us talk 10, 15, 20 years ago, 30 years ago,
[3:37:29.080 --> 3:37:33.720]  they laughed at us. Now they've seen it all come true. And they're going, okay, okay, I'm listening
[3:37:34.920 --> 3:37:37.880]  because they're not criminals. They're like the general public. They were kind of
[3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:44.440]  mesmerized or eased into corruption incrementally. And now the corruption is really clear.
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:50.360]  It's honorable. Now that it's finally clear, they're going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. As long as you
[3:37:50.360 --> 3:37:55.320]  turn back and don't consciously be part of evil. If you did some stuff that was bad in the past,
[3:37:55.320 --> 3:38:00.360]  but didn't know you were being bad, it's not bad. All of us have done stuff that was wrong.
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:05.320]  I mean, I was like a devil or something when I was 18, 19, 20 years old, man.
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:10.360]  I mean, I liked to get in fights. I like people start fights. Let me just like a beat them up.
[3:38:10.360 --> 3:38:15.320]  You know, I mean, I did all sorts of, I mean, I wasn't classically wouldn't think of it as bad.
[3:38:15.320 --> 3:38:21.480]  I think of it as bad today. I mean, you know, I, I liked women quite a bit. I mean, you know,
[3:38:21.480 --> 3:38:27.880]  that's why I can't sit here and be a hypocrite about other people. I mean, Rush Limbaugh,
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:37.080]  it's caught taking painkillers. He really did have back surgery. That stuff's highly addictive.
[3:38:37.080 --> 3:38:42.280]  The medical system knew when they were prescribing synthetic heroin to people that 90 plus percent
[3:38:42.280 --> 3:38:46.600]  of people that took it were going to get addicted. I don't judge Rush Limbaugh cause he got addicted
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:53.000]  to drugs, but I do judging because he says put people who were caught with cocaine or heroin
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:59.640]  in prison, the first offense for 10 years. The whole time he was bombed out of his brain.
[3:39:00.280 --> 3:39:03.720]  I've talked to people who worked with him in radio, huge pot smoker.
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:08.040]  I mean, he sits up there. He likes to drink. He likes marijuana. He likes pills.
[3:39:08.040 --> 3:39:12.200]  And then none of that's good Limbaugh, but I'm not up here judging you.
[3:39:12.200 --> 3:39:16.120]  I never had problems with marijuana. I never had problems with pills like you,
[3:39:16.120 --> 3:39:21.080]  but I could imagine how that could happen. I don't sit up here on my high horse going,
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:26.920]  look at Rush Limbaugh. He got caught taking a hundred oxy cottons a day, a hundred.
[3:39:26.920 --> 3:39:31.000]  That would kill like eight horses. He had such a tolerance.
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:36.840]  From eating so many of them over the last decade. My problem with Rush Limbaugh is that he still
[3:39:36.840 --> 3:39:41.960]  gets up there and says, throw the key away with people that are caught with illegal drugs.
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:46.120]  You're taking an over the counter drug, a prescription drug, but from behind the,
[3:39:46.120 --> 3:39:53.880]  the prescription counter that you got from a pharmacy that is the molecule is even more
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:40:01.240]  addictive than heroin. And you want to throw a heroin or crackhead in jail,
[3:40:01.240 --> 3:40:07.240]  but you don't want to go to jail. See, I'm sick of hypocrisy. And see,
[3:40:07.240 --> 3:40:13.240]  I've never been a hypocrite about anything I've done. And I sit here and think about
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:15.560]  how they're going to come at me. Angles. They might, and you know what?
[3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:18.920]  They're going to build strong men. They're going to make stuff up because that's what
[3:40:18.920 --> 3:40:21.880]  they've always done with Co and tell pro. They're going to make stuff up.
[3:40:21.880 --> 3:40:27.480]  Always done with Co and tell pro. There's nothing they can do to me short of setting
[3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:34.520]  me up or killing me. Nothing. There is nothing they can do. Nothing.
[3:40:37.320 --> 3:40:41.000]  Any way they cut it, any angle they go at me, it blows up in their face.
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:47.080]  So they're going to make stuff up. That's the only angle they've got. And they've made so
[3:40:47.080 --> 3:40:54.040]  much stuff up about everybody else that no one even believes it. That's what's great about
[3:40:54.040 --> 3:41:01.480]  all the Co and tell pro lives about me. One crazier than the last, always more insane,
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:09.640]  always based in lies. Enough about Alex Jones. It's just to get this phone call.
[3:41:09.640 --> 3:41:13.400]  They've been calling me for weeks. Finally got a hold of us. And to be talking to a huge
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:18.600]  national television host who wants to come down here into a profile on me and have newspapers
[3:41:18.600 --> 3:41:22.920]  in here every other day, big magazines. I mean, they finally are paying attention.
[3:41:25.240 --> 3:41:32.360]  I'm having some gallows humor here. I mean, this is what I've asked for.
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:36.680]  I wanted to change the world. You've helped me do it together with listeners.
[3:41:36.680 --> 3:41:41.880]  And now here we are. We're really going to the next level.
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:49.080]  I asked for it. So I'm ready. I'm ready.
[3:41:50.760 --> 3:41:54.600]  It's kind of like a few times when I was growing up and I'd see some big bully beating up some
[3:41:54.600 --> 3:42:00.920]  little kid and the guy'd be, you know, twice my size. I'd walk up and say, buddy, you better stop
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:05.960]  doing that. And I knew what I was in for when I did that. I knew this guy was going to turn around,
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:11.080]  start pounding on me, but I would just go past the fear, step in, punch him under, cut in the nose,
[3:42:11.080 --> 3:42:15.400]  their whole nose would just tear off with blood spraying out everywhere. Or maybe they got me
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:20.120]  down. Maybe they started pounding my head in. You just got a good old boy gut up and roll him over
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:24.840]  and just start gouging their eyes out. You got to do what it takes. And it's the same thing
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:28.600]  politically. I came up with a new world order and I slapped him upside the head and I said,
[3:42:28.600 --> 3:42:33.480]  why don't you stop picking on all those kids you CPS and you kidnap? Why don't you stop all that
[3:42:33.480 --> 3:42:38.120]  corruption? You're doing it. They turned around to me, this little bitty guy. And you know what?
[3:42:38.120 --> 3:42:44.680]  They smashed me flat in the pancake. The blood that comes out of me, the blood of Patriots and
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:49.880]  tyrants will only make the tree of liberty grow. I just win any way you cut it. The only way to
[3:42:49.880 --> 3:42:55.480]  really win in life is to do the right thing, ladies and gentlemen. The only way to truly
[3:42:55.480 --> 3:43:00.200]  win in life is to do the right thing. You're not going to be fulfilled. You're not going to be happy.
[3:43:00.200 --> 3:43:05.240]  Your life is not going to be one 10th as good as it could be until you start fighting corruption.
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:09.800]  I mean, the stupid young Turks show millions of viewers a week on YouTube
[3:43:11.560 --> 3:43:15.320]  where they play the part of the middle of the road, laughing, joking newscast,
[3:43:16.360 --> 3:43:22.920]  did an attack piece on me saying, what's Alex so upset about CPS? What is that? Why is he angry
[3:43:22.920 --> 3:43:29.080]  at the CPS? What is that? How could five year newscasters been around for five years? They have
[3:43:29.080 --> 3:43:36.120]  a show on XM serious too. How could they not know what CPS is? How could they think I was a weirdo
[3:43:36.120 --> 3:43:41.960]  for getting angry knowing that over a million kids a year taken without due process
[3:43:42.840 --> 3:43:48.440]  by the child protective services nationwide under a UN program, and that the CPS is five
[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:52.760]  times more likely in Europe at seven times to abuse children than any other group?
[3:43:52.760 --> 3:44:02.680]  I mean, do the young Turks not know about CNN four years ago, 3,500 kids missing in Florida,
[3:44:02.680 --> 3:44:07.160]  and they found a bunch of them dead that had been in CPS custody. They raped these kids and
[3:44:07.160 --> 3:44:13.000]  then kill them. You don't think raping and killing kids is a big deal? No, no, you do think it's a
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:19.480]  big deal. You just are so ignorant. You don't know what CPS is. And you take a clip out of context
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:25.640]  of me getting angry about children being abused. What's wrong with you? What type of person doesn't
[3:44:25.640 --> 3:44:30.920]  get angry at children being raped by big fat government pedophiles? What type of person
[3:44:30.920 --> 3:44:36.680]  is so screwed up that they don't know this stuff's going on? What type of person doesn't get angry at
[3:44:36.680 --> 3:44:45.320]  that? What is your problem? You are the people that are screwed up. You are the people that don't
[3:44:45.320 --> 3:44:51.400]  get upset by tyranny. You don't get upset by Bush having secret arrest teams that snatch and grab
[3:44:51.400 --> 3:44:56.040]  and torture people. And then now they're putting them on trial after five, six, seven, eight years
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:45:02.440]  of torture, depending on the case. That doesn't freak you out. Having tyrannical government
[3:45:02.440 --> 3:45:11.560]  doesn't scare you. The only real monsters in this world, folks, outside of man are things like
[3:45:11.560 --> 3:45:17.000]  great white sharks and grizzly bears. And what do they kill? 10, 15, 20 people a year. But you're
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:21.880]  scared of them. When you're out in the woods in Colorado, you're walking around you and thinking,
[3:45:21.880 --> 3:45:27.320]  man, there's grizzly bears around here. Full grown men are scared of grizzly bears because
[3:45:27.320 --> 3:45:34.200]  you're supposed to be. But you're not scared of criminal big government that killed 200 million
[3:45:34.200 --> 3:45:39.640]  people in the 20th century conservatively. The number one cause of unnatural death. And you tell
[3:45:39.640 --> 3:45:48.520]  me I'm a weirdo because my instincts are tuned up and I know how dangerous big government is
[3:45:48.520 --> 3:45:54.280]  and I know it's taken over and I know what it does. And I'm here screaming, telling my fellow
[3:45:54.280 --> 3:46:00.600]  homo sapiens sapiens, I'm like a chimpanzee in a tree jumping up and down, warning other chimpanzees
[3:46:00.600 --> 3:46:08.360]  when I see a big cat coming through the woods. I'm like a bird that sees a cat coming up to eat
[3:46:08.360 --> 3:46:14.120]  some of the other birds. I've flapped my wings and fly off. I'm the weirdo because I'm sitting in
[3:46:14.120 --> 3:46:23.720]  the tree going. I mean, don't you understand anthropology, sociology? Don't you understand
[3:46:23.720 --> 3:46:27.640]  that I'm up here going, my God, they're building FEMA camps. They're brainwashing the public.
[3:46:27.640 --> 3:46:31.800]  They're training your kids to spy on you. They're launching all these wars. They admit they torture
[3:46:31.800 --> 3:46:37.320]  people's kids in front of them to get answers. The police nationwide are using pain compliance,
[3:46:37.320 --> 3:46:41.160]  torture to get answers out of people. Federal courts of rule, they can do it.
[3:46:42.840 --> 3:46:48.280]  See, I'm a homo sapiens sapiens. So I sit here with words warning you. A chimpanzee can't talk.
[3:46:48.280 --> 3:46:56.040]  So they just go, you understand that? See, I'm normal. You're not normal. I'm out of the boat
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:47:00.920]  dock somewhere and I see a family swimming around by boat docks and I see a water moccasin. I go,
[3:47:00.920 --> 3:47:06.520]  hey, watch out. There's a snake over here. Am I the weirdo or are you the weirdo? Somebody that
[3:47:06.520 --> 3:47:12.760]  thinks the world's all this funny, happy football and Christmas shopping and everything's cute and
[3:47:12.760 --> 3:47:17.240]  everybody acts trendy because the television through the social aren't typing tells you the
[3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:23.560]  cool guy's stupid and doesn't care and makes jokes and everything and you imprint on that like a baby
[3:47:23.560 --> 3:47:30.840]  duck. I did the imprint on television and the fake image of a stupid male. They teach everybody,
[3:47:30.840 --> 3:47:38.200]  be stupid, be vapid, be shallow. Don't be decisive. Don't take action. Don't rally people.
[3:47:38.200 --> 3:47:45.320]  Don't get upset. That's what human beings do. That's what men do. You fools. You castrated
[3:47:45.320 --> 3:47:53.480]  cowards. But you've been so domesticated, so castrated from birth, set in front of the TV set
[3:47:53.480 --> 3:47:59.400]  to rot in your crap filled diapers that when you see somebody trying to be a man, trying,
[3:47:59.400 --> 3:48:05.160]  doesn't mean I got all the answers, doesn't mean I'm perfect. But trying to be a man,
[3:48:05.160 --> 3:48:10.520]  trying to be a warrior for humanity, you get shocked by that. You should look in the mirror
[3:48:10.520 --> 3:48:19.880]  and be shocked by what you are. I'm done talking to you scum and you are your scum
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:24.440]  and we're all once scum in our lives till we get woken up and take action.
[3:48:24.440 --> 3:48:31.880]  I was once dumb as dirt. You don't have to be dumb as dirt. You don't have to think tyranny's cute
[3:48:31.880 --> 3:48:40.360]  and funny. I'm going to come back Jim if you call us in the now and what's coming up and we'll go
[3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:45.240]  over all the news with him. Yeah, I shouldn't get upset about the Arabs announcing they're
[3:48:45.240 --> 3:48:49.560]  fully dumping the dollar. Oh, you'll be upset when your standard of living falls jackass.
[3:48:49.560 --> 3:48:56.840]  See, I got upset about real things. I don't care if the cowboys lose. I do care about the dollar
[3:48:56.840 --> 3:49:02.120]  dying. Whose head screwed on straight? Mine or yours?

[3:52:02.760 --> 3:52:06.760]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:52:06.760 --> 3:52:11.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[3:52:12.280 --> 3:52:16.280]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous
[3:52:16.280 --> 3:52:21.960]  influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's
[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:28.200]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies
[3:52:28.200 --> 3:52:34.040]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,
[3:52:34.040 --> 3:52:38.840]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists,
[3:52:38.840 --> 3:52:42.920]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:52:42.920 --> 3:52:49.240]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the
[3:52:49.240 --> 3:52:56.520]  republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right

[3:54:08.760 --> 3:54:12.600]  Alan Watts coming up. Let's talk to Paul in Texas. Thanks for holding, Paul.
[3:54:12.600 --> 3:54:20.920]  Hey, Alex. Hey, buddy. I'm Debra Medina's coordinator here in Austin and Travis County.
[3:54:21.720 --> 3:54:28.040]  And, man, I've been trying to get a hold to Chuck North. And I was just wondering if you knew,
[3:54:28.040 --> 3:54:32.680]  if he had any plans on endorsing or if he's talked about anybody and the governor's race,
[3:54:32.680 --> 3:54:37.480]  and if not, man, how can we get him on board with Debra? It seems like it's over.
[3:54:37.480 --> 3:54:42.600]  Paul, I appreciate your call. You know, we've had Debra in. We like her for governor and we've supported her.
[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:46.840]  And I've gotten calls at home from people saying, you know, get Chuck Norris on the phone with her.
[3:54:46.840 --> 3:54:50.680]  It's not like I just call Chuck Norris. I'm saying, hey, Chuck, get over here and do this.
[3:54:50.680 --> 3:54:55.160]  I mean, I can do that with like Charlie Sheen and a few other people I know really well. But
[3:54:56.920 --> 3:55:02.360]  Chuck's been a listener for more than a decade. He likes the show. He knows a lot more than he's
[3:55:02.360 --> 3:55:07.480]  letting on. He's starting to show people how much he knows. But maybe a few years down the road,
[3:55:07.480 --> 3:55:11.800]  I can call myself good buddies with Chuck Norris. But, you know, these people all like me because
[3:55:11.800 --> 3:55:17.320]  I don't bug them. I don't bug celebrities. I don't ask them for stuff. I don't hassle them.
[3:55:22.120 --> 3:55:25.400]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in New York. John, you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:55:25.400 --> 3:55:31.640]  How are you doing there, Alex? Hey, buddy. Yeah, this is John here with We Are Change,
[3:55:31.640 --> 3:55:36.680]  Hamburg, New York, a new chapter in the fight against tyranny. Well done.
[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:43.240]  That kind of thing. Just wanted to bring a point to you. I'll let you know that we just started
[3:55:43.240 --> 3:55:49.720]  up here in Western New York. Today, I went to Ms. Nancy with the doctor's name.
[3:55:49.720 --> 3:55:56.040]  It's, uh, you know, the doctor there that came up with a good slogan, just get your damn shot.
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:56:03.560]  Yes. Yes. Yeah. Well, we went to her blog today and we posted a paper that we released on Facebook
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:09.000]  not long ago called, uh, The Pandemic Hopes. Essentially, what it is, is that the paper
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:13.720]  that pretty much looks at the statistics as they're posted to today's date. Yeah. This,
[3:56:13.720 --> 3:56:18.200]  this flu is killing about 20% of what the regular flu does this far into the year.
[3:56:18.200 --> 3:56:24.040]  There's now indictments coming down in Europe of EU members, UN members where they, where the
[3:56:24.040 --> 3:56:29.240]  scientists are all making money off the hype. It is a pack of criminals, but it doesn't stop there.
[3:56:29.240 --> 3:56:35.720]  They're adding chemicals to the vaccines. Appreciate the call, John. It's worse than that.
[3:56:35.720 --> 3:56:43.160]  You're paying them to get Alzheimer's and cancer and to be sterilized. Cynthia in New Jersey. Go ahead.
[3:56:43.160 --> 3:56:50.200]  Oh, hi. It's a privilege. I want to tell you that, uh, I called Time Magazine today because
[3:56:50.200 --> 3:56:56.200]  it's been Bernanke being named man of the year and nobody there would want to talk to me. Um,
[3:56:56.200 --> 3:57:03.400]  but I did leave several messages. Um, just felt that I wanted them to know that we know
[3:57:03.400 --> 3:57:10.120]  that they gave the prize to the man who caused this whole economic, uh, collapse. Well, let's
[3:57:10.120 --> 3:57:15.160]  say, let's say one of the top lieutenants of summers in Rubin and others that set it up under
[3:57:15.160 --> 3:57:20.680]  Clinton and worked it under Bush. It's all, yes, one of the King criminals. It's like giving Adolf
[3:57:20.680 --> 3:57:27.720]  Hitler an award for fighting Nazis. But I just wanted them to know that, that we know and they're
[3:57:27.720 --> 3:57:34.840]  not fooling anyone. Don't subscribe to them. You know, literally, literally don't. I mean,
[3:57:34.840 --> 3:57:41.000]  I'm just saying Time Magazine is a joke. Newsweek's even worse. Every issue I see talks about how
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:45.480]  great killing old people is. I mean, it's like a Twilight Zone episode. Since when did just
[3:57:45.480 --> 3:57:50.920]  everything turn to psycho land? Everything is upside down. Uh, you know, Obama gets the Nobel
[3:57:50.920 --> 3:57:59.640]  Prize for warmongering. So, um, also to the other caller, the woman, um, who's, uh, the child and
[3:57:59.640 --> 3:58:05.640]  yeah, here in, here in Austin, uh, and we, we confirmed it, we pulled it up. Uh, the corporations
[3:58:05.640 --> 3:58:10.680]  have to give the schools money to make the kids write dossiers on their parents. Go ahead. Yes,
[3:58:10.680 --> 3:58:16.120]  well, um, my son's 26, but when he was 18 and he had his, uh, last checkup with the pediatrician,
[3:58:16.920 --> 3:58:21.720]  uh, my husband called and said, do not get him the hepatitis vaccination and they tried to get
[3:58:21.720 --> 3:58:25.640]  it to him. He went in there by himself because he was 18 years old and I waited for him in the
[3:58:25.640 --> 3:58:31.160]  waiting room and, uh, I couldn't believe that they tried to give him the vaccination when my
[3:58:31.160 --> 3:58:35.240]  husband had called ahead and said, do not get him that vaccination. There's a bounty. Absolutely.
[3:58:35.240 --> 3:58:38.680]  There's a bounty on getting that soft kill weapon in there. Of course, the doctor doesn't carry
[3:58:38.680 --> 3:58:44.840]  it. He just wants to go to golf course, have sex with his mentors. You are listening to GCN.
