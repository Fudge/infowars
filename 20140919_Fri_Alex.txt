[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:32.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.960 --> 00:39.120]  well Scottish voters supposedly promised to stick with the UK but there's
[00:39.120 --> 00:45.840]  shocking video compilation shot right off UK television right off Scottish and
[00:45.840 --> 00:52.800]  English and Irish television it's a compilation showing live feeds of huge
[00:52.800 --> 01:02.840]  stacks of voter cards that say yes leave but they're in the stacks that say no
[01:02.840 --> 01:08.080]  stay now Stalin said the great part about running the government was he got
[01:08.080 --> 01:13.200]  to count the votes so he didn't care how you voted just who counted them there
[01:13.200 --> 01:17.320]  is a lot of evidence of election fraud there's not always election fraud and a
[01:17.320 --> 01:23.680]  lot of polls it was running obviously neck and neck but this does look pretty
[01:23.680 --> 01:28.000]  bad and there were pros and cons from researching it stay in the UK or get out
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.240]  of it but I'm for whatever the Scots wanted to vote to do but they've been
[01:34.240 --> 01:40.040]  so domesticated under socialism and under Labour Party for 50 60 years that a
[01:40.040 --> 01:44.200]  lot of them are scared to get out of the welfare state they were in for a new
[01:44.200 --> 01:49.200]  welfare state they were being promised if it was managed right and if foreign
[01:49.200 --> 01:53.640]  interest didn't come in and loot Scotland they've been Greece and Italy and so many
[01:53.640 --> 01:58.280]  other countries then I would be for Scottish independence but you know what
[01:58.280 --> 02:06.080]  it's not really my business is it it's the Scots business and if there is fraud
[02:06.080 --> 02:13.040]  going on here we need to expose it and my gut tells me that there probably is
[02:13.040 --> 02:18.240]  fraud maybe on both sides that's what usually happens in elections it's like
[02:18.240 --> 02:21.640]  a war who can steal on both sides that's always the argument well they're
[02:21.640 --> 02:25.400]  gonna cheat so we better cheat but there's just really massive evidence
[02:25.400 --> 02:28.560]  amounting that it that there was fraud and Paul Watson will join us we'll roll
[02:28.560 --> 02:32.880]  some of that video for TV viewers to see a radio listeners can go to info
[02:32.880 --> 02:39.040]  wars.com Russian election observers are saying Westminster rigged Scottish

[09:05.800 --> 09:12.040]  the background of different clips from the news showing huge tables of the
[09:12.040 --> 09:21.160]  ballots where people reportedly were saying that they wanted independence
[09:21.160 --> 09:34.240]  saying yes but then it's in the no column says it's in the no stack and
[09:34.240 --> 09:44.200]  they zoom in on the ballots stack after stack and it's marked yes yes yes and
[09:44.200 --> 09:52.560]  then it cuts from Sky News to other videos that individual shot showing what
[09:52.560 --> 10:03.240]  appears to be the people running it filling out piles of no votes and putting
[10:03.240 --> 10:08.880]  them in the yes stacks this was on national television just in the
[10:08.880 --> 10:15.480]  background as the commentators are talking this is going on yes supporters
[10:15.480 --> 10:20.920]  claim video shows Scottish referendum was rigged despite a 10% margin of
[10:20.920 --> 10:25.000]  victory with no campaign the Scottish referendum some supporters of the yes
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.880]  camp for independence are pointing to videos which they claim show evidence of
[10:28.880 --> 10:34.560]  vote rigging we're going to be breaking this down huge news on the stock market
[10:34.560 --> 10:39.200]  front massive news on the Ebola front
[10:39.640 --> 10:44.320]  Sierra Leone to shut down for three days and basically ordered people to stay
[10:44.320 --> 10:51.320]  indoors to stop the viral spread well it gestates for upwards of 22 days before
[10:51.320 --> 10:57.320]  the symptoms manifest so how is a three-day shutdown gonna stop the viral
[10:57.320 --> 11:01.320]  spread and they're talking about Sierra Leone and other countries over there
[11:01.320 --> 11:06.560]  ceasing to exist and becoming wastelands just just just road warrior level
[11:06.560 --> 11:10.520]  collapse that's what happens big sophisticated societies are very
[11:10.520 --> 11:17.080]  delicate the bigger the more fancy the more complex the easier things
[11:17.080 --> 11:24.120]  degenerate just on time deliveries populations that aren't self-sufficient
[11:24.120 --> 11:28.600]  and now that Ebola is hitting big African cities in some cases that have
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.560]  three four million residents it is causing absolute havoc and it's clear
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.400]  the media has been covering up just how bad this is now the UN says Ebola
[11:38.400 --> 11:44.280]  threatens global peace and security eight dead an attack on virus education
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.760]  team in Guiana the official death toll reaches two thousand six hundred it was
[11:49.760 --> 11:52.920]  well over three thousand a long time ago folks that they are really they're not
[11:52.920 --> 11:57.600]  out there tracking what's happening no one wants to get near it mystery
[11:57.600 --> 12:01.640]  illnesses plugging girls in Colombia blamed on vaccine causing feigning and
[12:01.640 --> 12:07.320]  paralysis I've seen this let me not exaggerate in 20 years on air let me
[12:07.320 --> 12:17.600]  not exaggerate probably a thousand times just this week we saw London
[12:17.600 --> 12:22.640]  Telegraph you name it dozens and dozens dead 30 plus dead and that's just what
[12:22.640 --> 12:25.840]  they're tracking and admitting to some people giving the shots saying that so
[12:25.840 --> 12:30.560]  that's a whitewash usually there'll be like 500 dead they'll say 36 dead or
[12:30.560 --> 12:36.080]  they'll have us a flu shot test this was in Bloomberg a few years ago where
[12:36.080 --> 12:40.960]  they'll shoot up all the homeless people at a clinic and they'll say 14 died and
[12:40.960 --> 12:46.120]  later it turns out it's 40 something I mean almost everybody died that took it
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.200]  and it turned out it was some deadly souped up weasel flu remember that
[12:50.200 --> 12:59.000]  remember that flu shot kills homeless in Czech Republic was the headline this
[12:59.000 --> 13:08.200]  week it was Syria UN held area with the rebels forcibly shooting people up you
[13:08.200 --> 13:11.520]  got homeless people in the Czech Republic in Poland was both places
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.840]  there's a London Telegraph 2008 homeless people die after bird flu vaccine
[13:16.840 --> 13:19.600]  trial in Poland I mean there's so many of these I can't even keep track of them
[13:19.600 --> 13:27.360]  what I'm getting it is this week I saw a vaccine deaths in Pakistan in Syria and
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.640]  now in Columbia and they and that's what's in the news there they go we take
[13:31.640 --> 13:36.280]  the shots and the little girls start dying two plus two equals four you take
[13:36.280 --> 13:40.200]  the Gardasil shot blood starts pouring out every orifice two days later and you
[13:40.200 --> 13:43.600]  get paralyzed for a couple months and then earn a wheelchair the rest of your
[13:43.600 --> 13:50.520]  life if you're lucky it killed a bunch of people in the trials it's nine years
[13:50.520 --> 13:54.200]  ago they couldn't roll the drug out so they had Rick Perry come out probably
[13:54.200 --> 13:59.720]  useful idiot at the time as they sent somebody unofficially from his office to
[13:59.720 --> 14:07.840]  kind of apologize to me one of his main people he's not all bad he likes you
[14:07.840 --> 14:14.680]  you know he wants to help whatever Perry you never walked it back I think he did
[14:14.680 --> 14:18.560]  say it was a mistake once to say it's the law take the Gardasil shot when
[14:18.560 --> 14:22.960]  there was no law he callers calling they go I live up here in Kentucky I had one
[14:22.960 --> 14:29.800]  yesterday and they're telling us we got to take the vaccines they're saying it's
[14:29.800 --> 14:34.600]  the law and I go sir it's not the law they're lying there's a waiver that they
[14:34.600 --> 14:38.160]  have to give you but even the waiver is not law it's all just buffalo in you

[14:46.600 --> 14:49.000]  seen this literally hundreds of times they'll go into the school nurse in
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.040]  Texas or Tennessee or New York they'll go I want that waiver they'll go there's
[14:53.040 --> 14:58.240]  no waiver yes there is no there's not it's a criminal enterprise everywhere
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.920]  with all these people just trained to lie lay trained to engage in massive
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.880]  sustained continual fraud ladies and gentlemen you can go to Google right now
[15:08.880 --> 15:15.360]  and type in vaccine exemption form Kentucky vaccine exemption form Ohio
[15:15.360 --> 15:22.080]  vaccine exemption form Nebraska vaccine exemption form Texas and it will pop up
[15:22.080 --> 15:26.240]  the state health department with the form that they all you got to spill it out
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.400]  mail it in and then show the school you have it if you want to comply my kids
[15:31.400 --> 15:34.960]  have gone to private school they bring all this stuff up I just show them the
[15:34.960 --> 15:38.600]  waiver then I show them the code there is no law they go you're right I don't
[15:38.600 --> 15:43.000]  vaccinate my kids nurses try when I had three kids in the hospital tried to push
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.160]  it and later they go oh I listen to your show I don't give my kids it either out
[15:46.160 --> 15:50.240]  you I got sick from vaccines here years ago there it is Texas vaccine exemption
[15:50.240 --> 15:56.600]  program vaccine info.net I mean this is how they play the ignorance game in this
[15:56.600 --> 16:02.560]  one microcosm of vaccines if you know this microcosm it's a rosetta stone you
[16:02.560 --> 16:07.880]  know everything because it shows how ignorance works listeners hear me saying
[16:07.880 --> 16:11.680]  this but the schools lying to them and the news is saying it's the law and the
[16:11.680 --> 16:21.560]  governor's saying it's the law and they believe I'm lying because if the media
[16:21.560 --> 16:25.280]  and the school are lying well my gosh we have criminals in control well you bet
[16:25.280 --> 16:28.360]  that's what you got when somebody is sitting there at the school nurses
[16:28.360 --> 16:34.280]  office lying to your face about vaccines I mean it's in the news again today
[16:34.280 --> 16:38.680]  mainstream news that little girls are dead and dying in Columbia right after
[16:38.680 --> 16:42.560]  they get shots and the parents are blaming on that well it's like walking
[16:42.560 --> 16:46.960]  outside it's raining you blame the rain for getting wet what a novel idea or you
[16:46.960 --> 16:49.800]  go out the street the truck runs over you and you wonder why your legs are
[16:49.800 --> 16:53.600]  broken and the cops show up and go it wasn't the truck that hit you the wind
[16:53.600 --> 17:00.920]  blew they just play these mind control games and I'm done playing them now
[17:00.920 --> 17:05.480]  joining us from London England Paul Joseph Watson I guess of Scottish to send
[17:05.480 --> 17:08.600]  himself and I know he's from the north of England
[17:08.600 --> 17:14.920]  formerly from Sheffield I know his view was mixed on this because if you bring
[17:14.920 --> 17:20.240]  in an outside group and they'll just be new government management and they may
[17:20.240 --> 17:24.200]  be looted but obviously the UK is a corrupt system as well but the UK
[17:24.200 --> 17:27.880]  itself is already under the EU and from what I've seen from Lord Monkin which is
[17:27.880 --> 17:31.920]  pretty powerful argument the EU it will be in more control of Scotland now
[17:31.920 --> 17:36.080]  because they're not getting out of the EU deal so it's almost a vacuum like a
[17:36.080 --> 17:40.560]  new conqueror you pull out one group and just insert another I want to get Paul's
[17:40.560 --> 17:45.440]  view on this and the big news that Scots are saying it was rigged Paul Joseph
[17:45.440 --> 17:51.040]  Watson your stories on info wars.com first off what do you make a fraud what
[17:51.040 --> 17:56.360]  do you think of the election well there are numerous claims coming out Alex in
[17:56.360 --> 18:00.440]  light of this voting which took place yesterday we know before the election
[18:00.440 --> 18:05.200]  even took place that they were sending out polling cards to children as young
[18:05.200 --> 18:08.720]  as three years old so there were there were all these people being registered
[18:08.720 --> 18:13.040]  to vote who weren't legally allowed to vote then yesterday you had police in
[18:13.040 --> 18:18.440]  Glasgow investigating at least ten different cases of people who came in
[18:18.440 --> 18:21.720]  to vote and were told that they had already voted they've been crossed off
[18:21.720 --> 18:26.600]  the list so obviously people were coming in to vote twice so that's confirmed
[18:26.600 --> 18:30.680]  that there was vote fraud that way then you've got these videos as you mentioned
[18:30.680 --> 18:34.320]  which again you know for the moment they're just allegations we don't know
[18:34.320 --> 18:38.880]  exactly what they show and this is this is sporadic as far as we can tell but
[18:38.880 --> 18:44.160]  you know one example the ladies counting out the vote she takes cards from the
[18:44.160 --> 18:49.360]  yes pile puts them in the no pile another example there's a bunch of yes
[18:49.360 --> 18:54.520]  cards referendum cards that are stacked on top of the no table so they may have
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.080]  been counted as no vote and by the way all the body language of these people is
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.560]  very sneaky looking that's what my kids act like when they're doing something
[19:01.560 --> 19:07.240]  wrong and then there's another guy who's apparently filling in referendum cards
[19:07.240 --> 19:10.920]  they could be something else but they look like the referendum cards at a
[19:10.920 --> 19:14.920]  polling station so why is he filling them in so there are numerous questions
[19:14.920 --> 19:19.480]  swirling around this nothing concrete but interesting comments also from
[19:19.480 --> 19:24.440]  Russian election observers who are obviously not you know neutral we're
[19:24.440 --> 19:29.200]  not claiming them as some authority but one of Russia's top election observers
[19:29.200 --> 19:33.520]  whose people were there came out today and said that I think the exact quote is
[19:33.520 --> 19:37.320]  let me get the exact code according to what our observers at the polling
[19:37.320 --> 19:41.680]  officers tell us there were more yes votes during the vote count and basically
[19:41.680 --> 19:47.000]  he says that every violation in managed imaginable occurred during the vote
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.040]  count so that's I want to break this down we come back in detail from your

[24:08.880 --> 24:12.360]  a lot of financial news coming up in the next segment for Paul leaves us
[24:12.360 --> 24:18.040]  Ali Babu's IPO to end U.S. dominance and technology sector experts are saying
[24:18.040 --> 24:24.040]  meanwhile we've got a more detailed story up on info wars.com dealing with
[24:24.040 --> 24:27.760]  what exactly is happening with the ultra-rich buying gold bars as the
[24:27.760 --> 24:31.640]  stock market goes to all-time highs but the telegraph is also reporting on it
[24:31.640 --> 24:37.720]  super rich to buy Italian job-style gold bars economic uncertainties trigger rush
[24:37.720 --> 24:45.960]  to buy 12.5 kilo gold bars worth as much as 300,000 pounds each or $500,000 or
[24:45.960 --> 24:51.320]  so absolutely universities governments they're all private individuals are
[24:51.320 --> 24:57.000]  just buying gold at record levels but they artificially use the paper market
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.080]  to hammer it this has come out even in the New York Times and just to keep it
[25:02.080 --> 25:05.520]  at the price well that's a buying opportunity because when all this paper
[25:05.520 --> 25:10.280]  goes down but I don't even plug gold because the average people won't buy it
[25:10.280 --> 25:14.880]  unless it's racing up I buy gold when it's going down so unfortunately it's
[25:14.880 --> 25:18.720]  been the same for a while haven't bought any but as soon as it dips I get in
[25:18.720 --> 25:23.560]  there and buy some and I've built a small amount for my family a little nest egg
[25:23.560 --> 25:28.040]  as you can say a lot of silver as well most my silver I bought at $5 $6 $7
[25:28.040 --> 25:33.480]  most my gold I bought at 300 and 350 400 never sold any of it did you sell it when
[25:33.480 --> 25:37.480]  it went to 2,000 did you sell it when it went down to 1100 did you sell one of
[25:37.480 --> 25:42.680]  it back up to 13 I just just you know and that we're gonna cover that up Paul
[25:42.680 --> 25:49.320]  Watson continuing with you on Scotland you would think after the the British
[25:49.320 --> 25:52.880]  trying to take it over for 500 years and finally getting it the last few hundred
[25:52.880 --> 25:56.520]  and exploiting it to a great extent the British Empire not the British people
[25:56.520 --> 26:03.000]  so much the most exploited under the Empire in many respects most happily
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.120]  exploited I could also add from my historical research I really don't buy
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.320]  it they didn't vote for independence because the polls most polls are running
[26:10.320 --> 26:16.640]  what 5% for what do you think really happened here I think I think it they
[26:16.640 --> 26:21.200]  were set to get the yes vote as of a couple of weeks ago that was the crucial
[26:21.200 --> 26:25.320]  point where those polls said that the yes campaign was ahead for the first time
[26:25.320 --> 26:30.680]  because at that point the elite in Westminster went into a complete tailspin
[26:30.680 --> 26:35.360]  they were in an absolute panic the three major parties aligned they all went up
[26:35.360 --> 26:39.560]  to Scotland and the propaganda was intense they corralled the media the BBC
[26:39.560 --> 26:44.320]  most of the tabloids around around this no campaign and then you saw the polls
[26:44.320 --> 26:49.000]  again sway backwards so whether there was voting fraud or not certainly in
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.040]  sporadic cases it seems that way also these other election observers are
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.680]  saying that the polling the polling slips in places like Edinburgh were
[26:57.680 --> 27:02.040]  just lying around there was no security whatsoever they called it last century
[27:02.040 --> 27:06.880]  style voting so there were obviously some sporadic cases of it but I think it
[27:06.880 --> 27:11.840]  was that propaganda in the week beforehand where the establishment rallied
[27:11.840 --> 27:16.560]  everything around this no campaign that kind of swung it back for them but in
[27:16.560 --> 27:21.120]  terms of the long-term general picture I mean it's again it's as the New York
[27:21.120 --> 27:25.240]  Times says it's the crisis of the global elites from my perspective they were
[27:25.240 --> 27:30.200]  just voting for a new slave master because a Alex Salmon the leader of the
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.360]  yes campaign the SNP party is basically an outright socialist they used to be a
[27:35.360 --> 27:39.760]  Maoist they basically want more welfare they would have just delivered Scotland
[27:39.760 --> 27:43.960]  even further into the hands of the EU so it wouldn't really have been a positive
[27:43.960 --> 27:47.440]  change it probably would have collapsed well exactly that's why at a
[27:47.440 --> 27:50.520]  primitive level knowing what happened to the Scots I want him to get free of the
[27:50.520 --> 27:55.160]  UK but the UK for all intents and purposes is has 83% of its laws made by
[27:55.160 --> 28:01.760]  the EU that's even more evil and it's just almost didn't even matter right but
[28:01.760 --> 28:06.240]  you know if there are you look to other places in Europe like Murdoch said
[28:06.240 --> 28:10.160]  yesterday it's an anti-establishment groundswell where there are more
[28:10.160 --> 28:15.160]  alternative options like UKIP which are not going to lead the the country
[28:15.160 --> 28:18.640]  straight to certain extent I mean there are some disturbing noises coming out
[28:18.640 --> 28:22.320]  of UKIP recently and forage saying we need to give up freedom for security
[28:22.320 --> 28:27.440]  which is of concern but you know I voted for UKIP and they seem to be really
[28:27.440 --> 28:31.160]  rabble rousing in terms of upsetting the establishment you've got Le Pen in
[28:31.160 --> 28:35.360]  France there was a recent poll that said if there was a presidential election in
[28:35.360 --> 28:40.360]  France now I believe the next one is in 2017 that Le Pen would defeat Holland it
[28:40.360 --> 28:44.480]  obviously is a again another socialist who has completely wrecked France's
[28:44.480 --> 28:48.920]  economy so there's this entire groundswell of separatism as well the
[28:48.920 --> 28:54.080]  Basque region in Spain, Catalonia, Bavaria in Germany, Denmark, Holland all these other
[28:54.080 --> 28:59.360]  places where there's a groundswell of anti-establishment separatism Italy as
[28:59.360 --> 29:03.320]  well which has been completely screwed over by the EU by the economic collapse
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.520]  and of course it's driven by these massive high unemployment rates and this
[29:07.520 --> 29:11.920]  discord with the establishment with the elite so in terms of the general trend
[29:11.920 --> 29:16.560]  even though the yes campaign lost I think that the outlook is positive in
[29:16.560 --> 29:22.480]  terms of this separatist move to get power based more locally so people can
[29:22.480 --> 29:25.960]  have a greater impact. I want to come back and go over your article a little bit

[33:52.400 --> 33:56.800]  plagues girls in Colombia and then it links right in with saying the parents
[33:56.800 --> 34:01.200]  say it's after a vaccine program and they collapse and they start having
[34:01.200 --> 34:06.560]  convulsions I mean it's the same story over and over again what was the
[34:06.560 --> 34:14.000]  headline just Monday vaccine deaths in Syria I mean it's just it's just crazy
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.440]  then they go safe and effective safe and effective no adverse reactions in the
[34:18.440 --> 34:22.520]  vaccine program here in the US we're just good about when our kids have
[34:22.520 --> 34:25.600]  convulsions and blood comes out their nose or whatever and they never talk
[34:25.600 --> 34:30.200]  again and the doctor just tells us they don't know why and then or maybe they
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.480]  call the cops on you and say you you know you beat your kid then they get
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.200]  somebody else they can throw in the system I mean here in America we put up
[34:38.200 --> 34:44.280]  with this they have banned Gardasil in European countries in Japan in India
[34:44.280 --> 34:51.760]  within a year of it being introduced eight years ago but here in America oh
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.720]  they're banning GMO and they're pulling out of the McDonald's food in South
[34:56.720 --> 35:04.480]  Africa but not here they're banning in all of the world but not here not here
[35:04.480 --> 35:08.040]  and that's why we lead the pack in obesity and neurological disorders and
[35:08.040 --> 35:14.200]  so much more and I'm not being negative the good news is we know what's going on
[35:14.200 --> 35:18.400]  you don't want to walk around out in the field in the or the desert the middle
[35:18.400 --> 35:21.040]  of the night you'll step in a hole and break your leg I've always used that
[35:21.040 --> 35:24.920]  analogy and I was out in Big Bend wanted to cut across the parking lot to get
[35:24.920 --> 35:28.880]  back to the lodge my friend said there might be snakes out there and I go it
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.040]  looks pretty flat and I'm walking along in some scrubbrushing step right into a
[35:33.040 --> 35:38.080]  three-foot hole and blew out half of my Achilles and may have to have surgery
[35:38.080 --> 35:49.680]  eight months ago seven months ago I got a pimp walk though now literally and
[35:49.680 --> 35:53.800]  what have there been floodlights I'd have seen that hole must be one old
[35:53.800 --> 35:57.640]  telephone pole or light or something was a pretty big set perfectly round hole
[35:57.640 --> 36:04.480]  right there in the dark in grass just ought to fill that thing but that's
[36:04.480 --> 36:07.480]  what I'm here doing is trying to put light on things so we can see all these
[36:07.480 --> 36:14.000]  holes so we don't step in them break our ankle or break our foot or break our
[36:14.000 --> 36:21.200]  Achilles or walk into an old well they're supposed to fill old wells or put
[36:21.200 --> 36:24.640]  grates over them people dial the time out and night walk around a field well
[36:24.640 --> 36:30.160]  falling a well my dad was playing around one when he was a kid and fell in it
[36:30.160 --> 36:37.720]  like 20 feet he climbed out but this is what we're dealing with and so I can't
[36:37.720 --> 36:42.800]  just emotionally say I'm for Scottish independence I have to go back and say
[36:42.800 --> 36:45.880]  well there's other tyranny that's gonna come in and these are socialists that
[36:45.880 --> 36:50.040]  are running this so it may just be a deal to loot Scotland even faster than the
[36:50.040 --> 36:55.600]  UK would but it's all tentacles of the same monster and the tentacles kind of
[36:55.600 --> 36:58.680]  compete with each other when they're shooting out there grabbing things but
[36:58.680 --> 37:06.240]  whatever they grab still goes in the same mouth and so you'll have them
[37:06.240 --> 37:11.360]  fighting with each other over a piece of something on them there's competition to
[37:11.360 --> 37:14.360]  the new world orders criminal activities I want to get some final words on this
[37:14.360 --> 37:18.200]  from Paul Watson then we're gonna shift gears into other news Paul go back into
[37:18.200 --> 37:20.440]  your article because you got cut off earlier about what the Russians are
[37:20.440 --> 37:24.440]  saying and any other points that are important about this historic no vote on
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.360]  leaving her Britannic Majesties Kingdom and we have the image up there that Kurt
[37:29.360 --> 37:32.680]  Nemo put together of the Queen of England and a famous quote by Cecil Rhodes
[37:32.680 --> 37:38.880]  that's public why should we not form a secret society with but one object the
[37:38.880 --> 37:44.160]  furtherance of the British Empire and the bringing of the whole world under
[37:44.160 --> 37:50.240]  British rule and that's the guy that set up Oppenheimer to beers and set up the
[37:50.240 --> 37:53.720]  council on farm relations and publicly wrote multiple books that I've
[37:53.720 --> 37:57.680]  personally read that you can buy that are available at libraries describing the
[37:57.680 --> 38:01.880]  entire world government plan the 10 kingdoms the three super regions the
[38:01.880 --> 38:08.160]  eugenics based program around it it's incredible in formation info wars dot
[38:08.160 --> 38:16.040]  com right now going back to Paul Watson final comments yeah there are several
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.000]  remarks made by these Russian election observers ones report in news week that
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.080]  was the one who said the ballots were basically lying around no security
[38:23.080 --> 38:29.200]  whatsoever then there's Georgie Fyodorov who told RIA Novosti and he's part of
[38:29.200 --> 38:32.840]  the one of Russia's top election observer groups and again we're not
[38:32.840 --> 38:36.480]  pretending that they're neutral but it's still interesting to hear what they had
[38:36.480 --> 38:40.520]  to say about the referendum vote and he said quote according to what our
[38:40.520 --> 38:44.800]  observers at the polling offices tell us there were more yes votes during the
[38:44.800 --> 38:48.960]  vote count he also said Scotland found itself under immense pressure those on
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.680]  the UK side campaigning for a no vote resorted to every violation in manage
[38:53.680 --> 38:59.320]  imaginable and his comments are backed up by Igor Morozov who also pointed to
[38:59.320 --> 39:03.480]  the intense propaganda campaign on behalf of Westminster that preceded the
[39:03.480 --> 39:08.520]  vote in the week before and definitely said that that had an impact so you know
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.200]  so far there are these sporadic cases of vote fraud that were allegedly caught on
[39:13.200 --> 39:17.360]  video we've got those in the article as well so we'll continue to watch it I
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.360]  mean we know the police are investigating cases of vote fraud in
[39:20.360 --> 39:25.440]  Glasgow and there were ballots sent out to three-year-old children weeks before
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.480]  the vote took place so they're obviously illegal ballots being submitted as votes
[39:30.480 --> 39:34.760]  so we'll continue to track it but definitely a lot of questions being
[39:34.760 --> 39:40.440]  asked at the moment Paul what else do you keep in your eyes on we've seen this
[39:40.440 --> 39:47.160]  Alibaba IPO come out threatening quote US dominance of tech stocks the whole
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.800]  establishment world is always planned to suck the West Dry and then leverage
[39:51.800 --> 39:57.000]  that into investments to dominate Asia particularly China but China is also
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.560]  teetering on collapse because of the inequities and the corruption not
[40:00.560 --> 40:04.920]  inequities that communism didn't deliver it delivered total tyranny but the new
[40:04.920 --> 40:09.480]  inequities that they allow a superclass to engage in free market activity while
[40:09.480 --> 40:15.000]  keeping a giant underclasses slaves thousands of riots per month in China
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.940]  but it shows the globalist world view of like locust eating us to the bone or
[40:20.940 --> 40:26.920]  piranha and then moving on to the next phase yeah but I think there's a definite
[40:26.920 --> 40:30.840]  split that took place in fact a couple of months ago you had one of the top
[40:30.840 --> 40:34.680]  people out of these elite organizations I forget which one it was but he
[40:34.680 --> 40:38.880]  basically said that I think was the former US ambassador to Russia who said
[40:38.880 --> 40:44.320]  Russia is no longer part of the new world order they have betrayed us and now
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.640]  you see they're setting up this anti-IMF dollar system anti-dollar system
[40:48.640 --> 40:52.760]  they're setting up their own internet with China and Brazil and basically the
[40:52.760 --> 40:56.800]  BRICS nations are building this multi-polar alternative world system
[40:56.800 --> 41:01.800]  which is a direct threat to the unipolar new world order that's being built by
[41:01.800 --> 41:06.640]  the US the EU and NATO so I definitely see a split I mean you had a top Chinese
[41:06.640 --> 41:10.960]  PLA professor come out earlier this week and say that they're preparing for a
[41:10.960 --> 41:14.760]  world war they know where this is heading that they're going to get ready in
[41:14.760 --> 41:19.560]  terms of sea battles and territory battles so China is preparing for a
[41:19.560 --> 41:23.440]  world war we know Russia recently revised its military doctrine to treat
[41:23.440 --> 41:27.920]  NATO as an enemy to authorize a preemptive nuclear strike on NATO
[41:27.920 --> 41:32.000]  countries so it definitely seems like there's been a split over the past
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.760]  couple of years of course centering around Ukraine so it definitely seems to
[41:36.760 --> 41:40.840]  have changed in that way and then in terms of the the grassroots stuff of
[41:40.840 --> 41:44.920]  course you had Brzezinski saying there's a global political awakening so change
[41:44.920 --> 41:48.280]  and revolt is in the air but they're trying to steer it towards their own
[41:48.280 --> 41:52.640]  ends we saw they hijacked the Arab Spring obviously in the case of Scottish
[41:52.640 --> 41:57.400]  independence that wasn't a purely freedom orientated movement it was driven
[41:57.400 --> 42:03.320]  largely by the socialist SMP so revolt is coming changes coming it's just who
[42:03.320 --> 42:09.960]  who drives it who diverts it who gets control of the reins and then we have
[42:09.960 --> 42:13.200]  Newt Gennrich and others saying that the American people are really mad at the
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.000]  government the establishment better do something this is as he and others push
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.280]  the same agenda look at John Boehner with Obama funding Obamacare yesterday
[42:22.280 --> 42:26.120]  they didn't repeal anything they didn't even repeal the most horrible parts of
[42:26.120 --> 42:31.640]  it because the special interest wrote it and now the elite are realizing though
[42:31.640 --> 42:34.280]  that this is gonna be a horrible world we're gonna live in that they're
[42:34.280 --> 42:38.040]  destroying the golden goose the mid-level and even some of the high-level people
[42:38.040 --> 42:42.040]  aren't really bad they're just greedy mercenaries and then and now they're
[42:42.040 --> 42:47.520]  understanding whoa this is really an anti-human exterminist really wicked
[42:47.520 --> 42:53.080]  dark program that is coming in and it's not gonna be good for your grandkids
[42:53.080 --> 42:57.640]  it's not gonna be good for you people 30 40 years ago said the new world order
[42:57.640 --> 43:01.680]  will be really bad for your grandkids well 30 40 years later people that were
[43:01.680 --> 43:07.080]  20 30 40 years old then have grandkids and so now it's here this is the beginning
[43:07.080 --> 43:11.400]  of the season of woe this is the beginning of the seasons of crises
[43:11.400 --> 43:16.880]  after crises as the carrying limit of the planet is reached not because we
[43:16.880 --> 43:20.760]  didn't have a higher carrying limit but because they artificially cut stuff off
[43:20.760 --> 43:25.120]  stifled new development and innovation and they're gonna try to use the global
[43:25.120 --> 43:31.040]  crisis of the carrying limit being reached to pose as saviors to try to
[43:31.040 --> 43:35.280]  stop the collapse when they are actually orchestrating it and riding this
[43:35.280 --> 43:41.760]  dragon riding this beast it is a hellish dark logic they're using and we've all
[43:41.760 --> 43:44.680]  got front row seats to it and folks we don't want to just have front row
[43:44.680 --> 43:49.040]  seats we want it we want to get in the arena and that's where you'll get battle
[43:49.040 --> 43:53.320]  tested in politics battle tested in business battle tested in life that's
[43:53.320 --> 43:56.960]  where you'll learn how everything works and the whole system is built to arrest
[43:56.960 --> 44:01.680]  your development keep you in a childlike state that's why people used to send
[44:01.680 --> 44:04.880]  their kids to apprentice when they were seven years old they called it child
[44:04.880 --> 44:09.840]  labor it had some evils to it but what Paul Watson thank you so much for
[44:09.840 --> 44:12.640]  joining us I'm gonna continue breaking this down anything else you'd like to
[44:12.640 --> 44:17.320]  add yeah just on the economic front I mean they're obviously preparing this
[44:17.320 --> 44:21.280]  bubble to inflate it even bigger to pop it and collapse it and we're gonna see
[44:21.280 --> 44:24.960]  more riots I mean for months before Ferguson I was on here you were on
[44:24.960 --> 44:28.360]  saying that riots were coming that took place they're only gonna get bigger and
[44:28.360 --> 44:31.960]  they're making the bubble they're inflating it to such an extent you know
[44:31.960 --> 44:36.680]  I know people in the UK who needed mortgages for 300,000 pounds and the
[44:36.680 --> 44:41.600]  banks were offering them 600,000 just saying here take it take it so they're
[44:41.600 --> 44:45.520]  inflating that bubble even more now the inflation is hitting everywhere things
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.600]  are getting so expensive and then what happens when the welfare check comes but
[44:49.600 --> 44:53.440]  it doesn't buy anything anymore and they're increasing the welfare checks by
[44:53.440 --> 44:58.480]  3% a year they'd have to be increasing about 10-15% a year to even let people
[44:58.480 --> 45:01.920]  get what they had before that's why the discontent will increase people say
[45:01.920 --> 45:07.280]  hey make those lazy people work well they took the jobs away they brainwashed
[45:07.280 --> 45:11.640]  them and incentivized being lazy they don't know how then you've got working
[45:11.640 --> 45:17.120]  poor pay in the tickets pay in the fines pay in the fees pay in the doctors pay
[45:17.120 --> 45:21.160]  in the tuition they don't have the money they're they're breaking down they're
[45:21.160 --> 45:26.000]  having heart attacks they scream at their wife the wife calls the cops now
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.240]  they're in jail just everything is designed to destroy
[45:29.240 --> 45:33.160]  predatorily and drive us over the edge of a cliff Paul Watson thank you so much
[45:33.160 --> 45:38.600]  for joining us thanks Alex and again Paul Watson also does news reports for

[45:54.200 --> 46:00.680]  guess 14 years and I've been around on air for almost 20 and it's got some of
[46:00.680 --> 46:04.560]  the very first ever did it's nowhere even on the web but prisonplanet.tv it's
[46:04.560 --> 46:09.640]  got my book and Eve version Paul Watson's book order out of chaos elite
[46:09.640 --> 46:12.600]  sponsored terror new world order it's got the nightly news special reports
[46:12.600 --> 46:18.960]  special reports on the road it's just got everything all the films and HD 11

[46:24.160 --> 46:28.200]  your membership it's 595 share it with friends and family if you are a member
[46:28.200 --> 46:33.560]  and haven't done that become one today now before I go any further I'm going to
[46:33.560 --> 46:40.320]  take my noontime dose of survival shield X2 deep earth crystal form iodine
[46:40.320 --> 46:44.400]  that literally no one else has and that's why it's so different than the
[46:44.400 --> 46:50.560]  other iodines that are out there and I'm also going to mix as I do daily these
[46:50.560 --> 46:54.400]  it is three times a day I forgot this morning my super male vitality so I'm
[46:54.400 --> 46:58.560]  gonna take two droppers of that concentrated super herbs and plant
[46:58.560 --> 47:04.320]  extracts that are cold pressed organic and concentrated super charging designed
[47:04.320 --> 47:09.640]  to help your glands release the hormones you're supposed to have basically
[47:09.640 --> 47:13.680]  blocking from what Dr. Group breaks down all the estrogen mimickers and
[47:13.680 --> 47:17.080]  endocrine disruptors that are in the food and water and in this industrial
[47:17.080 --> 47:25.120]  society many of them on purpose so again what I do is I do that I have the
[47:25.120 --> 47:30.440]  secret sauce it's not available yet for listeners but as soon as it comes out it
[47:30.440 --> 47:35.320]  may be the share I'm not sure we will have the secret sauce for everybody that
[47:35.320 --> 47:42.320]  gives me so much natural energy with zero side effects sometimes sometimes too
[47:42.320 --> 47:47.840]  much energy and I'm gonna take my daily dose of this I'll give you a little
[47:47.840 --> 47:53.360]  secret people normally inject this because it's not able to be absorbed but
[47:53.360 --> 47:58.880]  this this this stuff that's coming out has a similar effect to injecting it but
[47:58.880 --> 48:06.240]  by drinking it we're just busy getting all the trademarking and patent pending
[48:06.240 --> 48:11.680]  and stuff on it before it's released there's nothing like releasing super
[48:11.680 --> 48:16.200]  quality products to fund your own operation and not be funded by taxpayer
[48:16.200 --> 48:20.800]  money like NPR MSNBC oh yeah MSNBC taxpayer funded as well why do you
[48:20.800 --> 48:23.680]  think it's literally government propaganda turn your guns in families are
[48:23.680 --> 48:28.160]  bad world governments good men are evil fathers are bad everyone's racist but
[48:28.160 --> 48:34.560]  Obama turn your guns in turn your guns in we love you we love you didn't build
[48:34.560 --> 48:39.360]  your business Alex Jones is a terrorist no I'm not I'm just wondering what's
[48:39.360 --> 48:43.960]  prosperity to be normal you people are much a psychopathic knuckle dragging
[48:43.960 --> 48:47.560]  control freaks that want to bring the whole world down as you get off on it
[48:47.560 --> 48:52.480]  you want to be able to engage in all your crime and stalk people and mess with
[48:52.480 --> 48:55.560]  them and play games you know what you know much more energy I get people are
[48:55.560 --> 49:03.600]  messing with me I love it it's kind of sick but I mean that's what it's all
[49:03.600 --> 49:08.400]  about that's why Thomas Jefferson call it the animating contest of liberty
[49:08.400 --> 49:12.480]  because that's when you're animated is when you're on the field I love sports
[49:12.480 --> 49:19.640]  I love playing them and life is a big giant war a big giant game and it's
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.400]  about playing by the rules being a good person but knowing how the dark side

[55:23.680 --> 55:27.520]  of the shopping cart just wanted to throw that out there okay let's get into
[55:27.520 --> 55:31.880]  the latest on ices I predicted this wasn't hard to do because I've seen them
[55:31.880 --> 55:37.120]  do this before Obama under public pressure knowing Saudi Arabia Qatar and
[55:37.120 --> 55:41.120]  others through the west and NATO armed ISIS to take over a bunch of areas they
[55:41.120 --> 55:45.680]  been arming them for Libya Syria Iraq they tried to have basically the Muslim
[55:45.680 --> 55:52.760]  Brotherhood same group Sunnis take over Egypt it just took two horrible things
[55:52.760 --> 55:56.600]  so it just shows you who runs our government the type of stuff they want
[55:56.600 --> 56:04.120]  to do this is in the news today Obama to micromanage war against ISIS
[56:04.120 --> 56:10.000]  military the military can't attack until he signs off on every strike because
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.960]  it works so well in Vietnam well again in Vietnam they didn't want to bombing
[56:14.960 --> 56:19.880]  the north because they wanted to keep the war going for war profits and
[56:19.880 --> 56:24.960]  Armand Hammer and Al Gore's father were on record owning factories in Russia
[56:24.960 --> 56:28.520]  making the weapons to then be sent in they couldn't even attack or torpedo the
[56:28.520 --> 56:39.200]  ships in the north that were bringing the weapons in to Hanoi same deal in 2001
[56:39.200 --> 56:42.760]  they wouldn't let them attack the real Taliban al-Qaeda in Kabul and other
[56:42.760 --> 56:47.000]  areas they would only let them attack the 14-year-old conscripts on average out
[56:47.000 --> 56:53.960]  in in in in ditches so our troops were killing real people and but they were
[56:53.960 --> 56:58.640]  literally shemulants now once there was an occupation the locals started
[56:58.640 --> 57:02.840]  fighting back then you just call them a Connie network
[57:03.880 --> 57:07.640]  those are just people that won't control the opium you're now you're fighting
[57:07.640 --> 57:13.600]  the local Afghan mafia that wants the schmack money so our troops fought real
[57:13.600 --> 57:20.480]  people my cousins killed them big sis killed them it's a real war you
[57:20.480 --> 57:24.960]  understand but it's staged in that they weren't allowed to take out the
[57:24.960 --> 57:29.880]  leadership same deal here I've watched so much gun pod footage and missile
[57:29.880 --> 57:33.360]  footage I mean I know when they want to give you crisp footage you see with
[57:33.360 --> 57:36.840]  people crawling around the ground with bleeding bodies flying around you look
[57:36.840 --> 57:40.040]  at these blurred out photos they're sitting in the video it'll be like a
[57:40.040 --> 57:44.480]  toyota truck with nobody around it empty or two pieces of artillery sitting
[57:44.480 --> 57:49.640]  there and boom no if you saw real footage it'd be a road with a column
[57:49.640 --> 57:54.280]  coming up it and jets coming in and dropping JDAMs and the whole column just
[57:54.280 --> 57:58.120]  blowing up that's what you'd be seeing you'd be seeing the day they poured in
[57:58.120 --> 58:03.600]  out of Iraq tens of thousands of them out of Syria you'd have seen highway of
[58:03.600 --> 58:09.960]  death and in those columns of Toyota trucks blown to bitch so Obama the
[58:09.960 --> 58:13.400]  micro-managed war against ISIS military can attack until he signs off on
[58:13.400 --> 58:17.040]  every strike well you don't want to bomb the Al Qaeda folks that McCain's been
[58:17.040 --> 58:22.800]  meeting with France makes first airstrike on Islamic State in Iraq
[58:22.800 --> 58:28.280]  other operations will follow in coming days says Halan to give me a break
[58:28.280 --> 58:33.280]  Rand Paul on ISIS intervention created the chaos good job Rand Paul pointing
[58:33.280 --> 58:38.400]  out that it all got started by our government we'll be right back

[1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:23.120]  Alex Jones
[1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:30.680]  I'm going over the phone shop in the next segment to get your take on Scottish
[1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:35.120]  independence your breakdown on Putin who's considering unplugging the internet
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:41.640]  in Russia in protester war US government warns Oregon researchers about
[1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:45.160]  monkey care that's in Reuters I've got an angle I want to go with on that I don't
[1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:49.080]  think people thought about also one third of Americans cannot name the three
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:55.560]  branches of government but one in four Americans are open to seceding from the
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:59.920]  USA well the USA got taken over and doesn't exist that's why you know
[1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:04.320]  callers calling and say calling in from FEMA region to calling in from FEMA
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:11.640]  region six calling in from FEMA region 10 because people don't know we're in 10
[1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:20.720]  FEMA regions isn't that just interesting
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:30.040]  organizing for action has 40% off on grassroots gear no one wants the Obama
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:39.040]  stuff and drudge points out including diapers $4 off on that $9 off a
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:44.120]  action yeah maybe we should come up with a new Obama shirt which shows a
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:48.640]  supporter splitting their own throat oh let's bring in a fascist health care
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:52.560]  system written by foreign banks that raises 20 plus taxes on people including
[1:01:52.560 --> 1:01:58.200]  seven taxes on poor people cuts their hours yeah payroll tax on working poor
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:01.680]  that is really good but you know what he's their buddy and smiles at them and
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:07.240]  they feel important so Obama supporters can actually buy diapers or onesies not
[1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:10.440]  just children I think that's how they go but I think that's a good thing and
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:13.920]  just all crap their pants and then and then and then the government can maybe
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:17.840]  have somebody come take care of it for him
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:26.620]  40% we need to do a story about that Obama swag plummets I mean everyone's
[1:02:26.620 --> 1:02:31.840]  running from Obama no one wants to be around Obama I saw in Chicago they're
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:35.680]  not gonna names name some street after him or some community center I mean give
[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:41.000]  me a break but he's meant to be destroyed and then they'll rehabilitate him
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:46.280]  he'll run you know like like the Clintons charities and keep half the money
[1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:51.720]  for himself and live in giant mansion sly on the airplanes the same scam over
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:03:00.240]  and over and over again but getting back to ISIS I was mentioning that Rand Paul
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:04.880]  on ISIS's intervention created the chaos in a long speech on the Senate floor
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:09.000]  the Kentucky Republican laid out his foreign policy vision and took
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:14.800]  transparent swipes at members of his own party that's what I like to hear that's
[1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:19.760]  more like daddy and I get the fact that the apple didn't fall from the tree and
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:22.480]  I know Rand Paul for many years I'm probably the first person I've
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:28.880]  interviewed I remember going who else around the campaigns I just had run on
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:34.400]  yesterday he was running for the house in 95 96 who else can you get on
[1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:39.960]  and I was talking to Rand Paul who was working on his campaign he said I guess
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:43.920]  I've done some newspaper interviews I get I don't really do radio but I could
[1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:50.000]  come on I guess he came on my nighttime radio show because the district used to
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:53.760]  come up down by Houston right up to South Austin so they really want they
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:57.640]  like my show because they got support on it I'm not bragging it's just weird
[1:03:57.640 --> 1:04:03.000]  he'll probably get a good chance to get up being president and he obviously he's
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:06.960]  got to do some politics for the main line because the main line is so dumb
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:13.000]  down but he really is a good guy I know he's good I admire Ted Cruz I admire
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.040]  anybody do a 36-hour filibuster without going to the bathroom I mean it's
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:22.680]  tiring doing a three-hour radio show but standing up for 36 hours and being
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:27.120]  eloquent the whole time and he's got a very good voting record I don't like
[1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:33.640]  some of his Goldman Sachs past or it was wife with the CFR but you know what
[1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:36.360]  someday we'll take over the CFR someday we'll take this country back we
[1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:40.160]  have to be ready for the power structure people that are good at it to
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:46.560]  join us we can't just say well you were in the CFR once well what lawyer
[1:04:46.560 --> 1:04:50.520]  working for Goldman Sachs didn't if you're not going somewhere we got to be
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:55.320]  ready for people to join us and then if they have good fruits and if they do the
[1:04:55.320 --> 1:05:00.520]  right thing then they're on the team we'll be back the government's Department
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:04.200]  of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo at the same time they're

[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:21.440]  former presidential candidate best-selling author researcher Chuck Baldwin and
[1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:25.680]  his son Tim Baldwin is a constitutional lawyer are going to join us
[1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:32.120]  they're up in Montana and it's in the newspapers there and the attorney
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:39.400]  generals involved they have prosecutors telling lawyers in court don't bring the
[1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:44.600]  Constitution up and they're they're acting like it's illegal to be a
[1:08:44.600 --> 1:08:49.280]  libertarian or a conservative just like the army earlier this year was even in
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:53.720]  Fox News after we broke it I'm just pointing that out that this was
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:56.720]  confirmed should the founding fathers wouldn't be welcomed in today's
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:02.200]  military and quote do not be part of the tea party or attend evangelical
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:06.960]  churches or you will be disciplined including court martial and you're like
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:12.840]  what well that's first amendment plus those aren't even terrorist groups how
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:17.680]  could you say that they're seeing what they can get away with there they're
[1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:22.080]  pushing the envelopes so far they take us a million miles we fight back five
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:25.840]  hundred thousand they've still taken us five hundred thousand miles down a
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:33.120]  rattle that's like police all over the country who will shine spotlights in your
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:38.320]  eyes do all sorts of stuff like that will arrest people for taking photos of
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:42.520]  them in public or videotaping them and they'll say that you the iPhones a gun
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:46.920]  or the flash hurt their eyes every day I see news articles mainstream and
[1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:52.800]  alternative going a man beaten woman put in hospital put person arrested and
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:56.600]  charged for videotaping police in public I remember the guy we had on a
[1:09:56.600 --> 1:10:00.280]  couple times from Illinois who videotape police at his own junkyard and
[1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:05.320]  they charged him with enough crimes that he was going to be in prison for life
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:14.400]  and the state attorney general sent police down to openly try to advise
[1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:17.760]  with prosecutors how to get the conviction to set that precedent that's
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:23.640]  pretty scary there's a new headline here out of PN AC Tucson cop leaves
[1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:27.840]  photographer hospitalized that they're claiming he was blinded by flash they
[1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:33.480]  say it's an assault victim hospitalized with whiplash injury and then it goes
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:37.200]  into how the cop attacked them and again I'm not just here to attack cops
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.640]  because I got some beef with police themselves but we all know in North
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:45.720]  Korea and Mexico the cops are bad I don't want to become that we know the
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:49.720]  police became bad Nazi Germany we know the police were oppressors in Russia we
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:54.280]  know that when the government becomes corrupt and look how corrupt it is that
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:58.560]  it's gonna roll downhill and they're gonna create autocratic authoritarian
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:06.600]  in imperious mindsets and promote those cultures and I'm seeing it so I'm
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:12.440]  criticizing it this is something else that isn't illegal
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:23.080]  noisy neighbor six cops child services on innocent mom quote don't let your
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:28.800]  kids play outside she was told mom visited us police and CPS of her
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:34.680]  neighbor reported her for not this is so hard to believe but I see it
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:39.720]  literally every few days mom visited by police CPS after neighbor reported her
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:47.880]  for letting her son play outside in the park next door to their house you see
[1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:51.560]  these stories with straight faces so founding fathers can't be in the
[1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:58.640]  military wouldn't be welcome can't go to the church you choose can't be part of
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:03.840]  the tea party no law they just say it two plus two equals five you didn't build
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:09.040]  your business a Texas mom of three was visited by the police and child protective
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:13.240]  services after a neighbor reported her for letting her son play outside they
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:18.680]  said the neighbor was annoyed by the noises the children made a woman she
[1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:23.880]  did not know was at her door with Isaac and ask is this your son Roy nodded to
[1:12:23.880 --> 1:12:37.680]  the woman explained what happened in writing and it goes over it and so then
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:43.440]  the CPS and police show up and we see this constantly we see all over the
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:47.920]  country even $500 in your wallet when the police pull you over they say it's
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:51.200]  suspicious and they'll just call it Monday laundering and take it no judge no
[1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:56.840]  jury no nothing in federal asset forfeiture seizure what are the feds
[1:12:56.840 --> 1:13:01.400]  doing running the program over the police and what are the police doing
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:08.480]  robbing people and claiming that everything's illegal this is tyranny and
[1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:13.360]  no one's safe they want a tyranny in place because all over the world the
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:16.600]  same globalists have done the same programs so we know what their next
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:21.360]  move will be because they follow a boilerplate system they got so many
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:26.720]  operatives so many minions that it's it's not all coordinated it's rolled out
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:31.080]  in policies and then they just find corrupt people that'll follow orders to
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:39.760]  then bring it in and it's disgusting to see it unfolding like this let's move
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:46.680]  into some other news here today Boehner touts immigration reform the sooner we
[1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:49.480]  do it the better
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:55.120]  America's immigration system is a mess and reforming it would help the economy
[1:13:55.120 --> 1:14:00.760]  House Speaker John Boehner said last night now they know the public's not
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:10.080]  paying attention so all they do is just say yeah it's a mess with all these
[1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:14.320]  illegals of the open border and and all these children coming across even the
[1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:18.160]  government encouraged it pays for them ships from around the country tries to
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:22.160]  cover it up we don't know what's going on but I tell you a reform will fix it
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:25.880]  and we know what the bill says it'll just legalize anybody that gets here so
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:30.400]  that will encourage more to come then look oh it's so screwed up there's no
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:33.800]  border to begin with let's just make it a North American Union and that's what
[1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:38.640]  they're saying this is a North American Union so Boehner funded Obamacare
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:43.720]  bipartisanly with the Democrats yesterday and now he wants open borders
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:49.080]  calling it reform that's like if you have a bloody nose they say let me fix
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:53.920]  that bloody nose they take a hammer to your teeth oh your teeth are knocked
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:58.240]  out let me take a buzz saw your legs oh man you're bleeding to death let me rip
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:03.240]  your guts out and burn them in front of you that's called being drawn and
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:10.000]  quartered here's another one by Kit Daniels up on prisonplanet.com and
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:13.920]  info wars.com you need to get these stories out to people folks post them on
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:16.920]  Facebook send them out on your Twitter that's how we get the news out to people
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:20.320]  that's why we're having success that's why we're really causing the globalists
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:27.280]  a lot of problems report California lead band to triple ammo prices there's more
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:31.360]  than one way to skin a cat they say currently 95% of all ammo sold in
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:39.960]  California contains lead and now they've got a new tax that's 300% the
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:45.160]  previous cost of ammo Kit Daniels breaks it all down and links to the documents
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:50.520]  and next they just want to ban the ammo to begin with and then they ban the
[1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:54.040]  importation and they have the big banks don't let sporting goods stores have
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:57.600]  bank accounts if they've got guns retroactively they're just extra
[1:15:57.600 --> 1:16:02.640]  judicially outside of law nickel and diming and harassing everyone you're
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:06.240]  like why this won't live in California everything they beta test in California
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:11.240]  in New York is then rolled out against the rest of the country Austin is a beta
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:16.480]  test to roll out against the rest of Texas this is their program this is
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:21.560]  their plan and it's led by a bunch of blue blood Republican rhinos who will
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:27.160]  lead us right into destruction and who are constantly attacking libertarians
[1:16:27.160 --> 1:16:32.000]  and tea party people like myself that would like to take over the Republican
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:35.960]  Party because that's one of our best venues to non-violently fix this
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:41.040]  situation and so who do you see attacking is constantly the neocons
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:46.040]  making stuff up doing all sorts of dirty tricks engaging in all this trying to
[1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:50.640]  control the debate and control the people here because they hate the fact
[1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:56.400]  that my talking points my common sense that I put out here they come from me
[1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:03.200]  and my brain are then parroted by the conservative libertarian media that's
[1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:08.000]  our real power we're like a rock into a pond the signature of info wars in
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:14.360]  prison planet and you the listeners is big when we first hit the water but when
[1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:18.800]  it spans out it's exponentially big that's why you're so powerful when you
[1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:22.480]  send a story like this out to your legislators or to your local talk show
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:28.200]  host or to your email list or to your Facebook you should build an email list

[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:41.560]  let ammunition could triple the price of all ammunition in the state forcing
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:45.400]  many gun owners to give up shooting yeah other forms of ammo or more expensive
[1:17:45.400 --> 1:17:51.000]  don't work as well according to a report by a firearm trade association it's a
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:54.840]  15-page report by the National Shooting Sports Foundation Association with an
[1:17:54.840 --> 1:17:58.440]  economic research firm conducted and concluded the ban will increase ammo
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:03.440]  prices up to and possibly beyond 300 percent for centerfire cartridges such
[1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:08.200]  as popular 30-odd six-spring filled 37 magnum shotgun shells and rimfire
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:11.480]  rounds including 22 long rifle which in the past is one of the most

[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:51.600]  the system who believe that it's gonna deliver Valhalla to them it's like a
[1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:56.120]  pig and a pin getting fed for the slaughter it just as happy as a pig in
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:27:00.720]  you know why and it has no idea that it's about to get shot in the head and
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:05.760]  the barn about to get strung up by its feet and its throat slit it's about to
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:12.200]  get butchered to make Christmas hams coming up in a month why it sees you
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:15.320]  coming it thinks you're the guy bringing the food it snorts all happy and
[1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:20.240]  squeals in its pen right when you reach over with that 22 magnum and put it right
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:23.960]  to its head to pull the trigger and you like the pig you've been raising it for
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:26.760]  a couple years but you know what you butcher your own meat and you're gonna
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:34.000]  smoke some hams and you pet the pig on the head and you pull the trigger and the
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:37.360]  globalist the ones that really aren't super evil they just see us like a pig
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:43.360]  or a cow dumb and silly you know it's kind of sad let's not kill them you know
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:48.920]  too mainly let's kill them softly with a soft kill by the way every time I talk

[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:58.280]  say and the government runs a soft kill no they got that in the movie from the
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:03.320]  real thing that's called killing someone softly that's how the Russians would do
[1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:07.120]  it in the Soviet Union is they take you out all the time for interrogations over
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:11.400]  the years and you never knew when they'd walk you out and you think you were
[1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:14.280]  going for interrogation they shoot you right in the back of the head with a
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:17.920]  small caliber handgun so it didn't scare everybody too much and they drag you
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:25.480]  off and then go throw you in a big ditch and a bulldozer come by and cover
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:29.520]  you up see I don't like a world where human life isn't valued all you people
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.120]  are like oh it's not a baby kill it you you goody two shoes people on abortion
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:36.840]  use the baby stuff for stem cells

[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:49.480]  treatment that'll grow your Achilles back 89% of the time and I don't have to
[1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:54.320]  have surgery but it's baby tissue and I won't have it people are like man but
[1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:57.640]  look my hair completely grew back it's only a couple thousand dollars you got

[1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:06.280]  hair to fall out big deal I want to get skinny before it does but so what I'm not

[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:15.440]  create them I'd be all for it but man if we don't care about babies nobody's
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:19.080]  gonna care about us don't you get that when you don't care about anybody in

[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:32.400]  can trust nothing feels better than folks knowing you're honorable nothing
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:36.880]  feels better that's why they always attack my honor and claim I'm disingenuous
[1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:40.680]  because there's nothing but a track record of me being honorable because they
[1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:45.000]  know that the answer to their evil is being honorable well they ride back with

[1:33:54.200 --> 1:34:00.840]  microcosm Martinez is the guy last year that when they were trying to ban guns
[1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:03.960]  all over the country he works for Bloomberg openly heads that up for in
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:08.600]  texas he said oh once we register your guns and get this past it was a gun
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:12.160]  registration we will ban them because the guy had a sign saying don't ban our
[1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:18.400]  guns and then people start attacking him when I had the awesome police chief in
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:24.280]  here he said oh well some of your guys as if they were my guys were yelling well
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:29.160]  it turns out I do know those guys for over 15 years or more go down with their
[1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:34.320]  signs that say no gun ban stop sign that says no gun ban there's two guys that do

[1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:40.720]  his name I should get that guy on as a guest longer than I've been on air
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:43.960]  because I used to go to gun rallies and he was there I was just somebody going to
[1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:48.380]  gun rallies mad at them trying to do registration and band shooting sports for
[1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:54.840]  young people and banned gun shows 23 years ago is when I got involved I was

[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:24.120]  great idea let's get Cargill in here to just talk about these mayors all over
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:29.640]  the country like Mike Martinez the mayor proteam who says we will ban your

[1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:24.720]  the establishment because you repeat talking points that you saw in the

[1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:47.240]  globalist takeover if somebody walks up to you in the park and punches you in the
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:54.440]  face if you fight back that's not radical that's the response and that's
[1:37:54.440 --> 1:37:57.920]  why all over the country they're banning lemonade stands and farmers markets and
[1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:01.880]  gardens because they don't want you to do anything human anything normal and
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:04.880]  that's why everywhere they're calling CPS if you let your kids play in their
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:08.840]  backyard I'm talking eight nine year olds or if they're 11 at a park across
[1:38:08.840 --> 1:38:15.240]  the street they're not letting people put their kids on planes to send them to
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:18.840]  family or buses now that's how kids learn that's how they get to where they
[1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:22.920]  can they don't want you to be a man they don't want you to be a woman I'm the
[1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:27.760]  best education I ever got was growing up in Dallas and being around rough people
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:33.680]  and being allowed to just do whatever I wanted I almost got killed a few times
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:38.440]  but I'm who I am today because of the stressors that I was put through and
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:43.400]  learning how to navigate them I'm not a total coward average people are afraid
[1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:46.160]  they're gonna lose everything if they don't go with the direction of the
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:50.600]  government the media the state-run press we're going to down a rat hole that
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:54.720]  you should all be horrified of because you keep saying yes yes yes yes yes yes
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:58.400]  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes they they now are saying childhood is going to
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:05.040]  extend to 25 or 30 they want men living in mama's basement and they'll raise the
[1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:10.560]  taxes and things to where it's hard to not live in your mama's basement and
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:14.280]  they want women to be the new men all haughty and disrespecting the men while
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:18.480]  they watch sports all day and while the women all fight with each other it's so
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:23.640]  inhuman it's so sick it's so dishonorable it's all the ancient
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:28.120]  archetypes being destroyed the globalist are assaulting humanity and we
[1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:32.280]  are what we were going into the future when they destroy the past they destroy
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:36.480]  the future they are preparing us for population reduction they are turning
[1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:41.040]  off our life force they are sabotaging our propulsion systems our need to
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:45.800]  explore and invent and be honorable and stand and fight in the animating
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:53.920]  contest of liberty it is it is so good to engage the enemy it is so good to be
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:59.600]  death-threaded it is so good to have people break into my car it is so good
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:07.400]  to be followed it is so good because they can't stand it because I love it I'm in
[1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:10.560]  the animating contest of liberty not that I'm special but I'm at least being
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:16.720]  somewhat like my ancestors who were spoiling for a fight they've even taken
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:20.000]  the concept of war and turned into something pure evil when it's something
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:24.360]  that's happened in our culture tribe against tribe you name it and sometimes
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:29.160]  is needed but now it's all deployed and systematic and scientific that they even
[1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:33.040]  take the idea of aggression to stand up for yourself is something bad in fact
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:37.200]  the ultimate evil is to stand up to a bully
[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:42.040]  they'll prosecute you all over this country and all over this world if you
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:48.080]  fight back against muggers or people breaking into your house that's the
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:52.440]  ultimate sin the ultimate sin is a good man or a good woman who says I have
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:55.520]  dignity and I'm not going to be pushed around and I'm gonna sit at the front of
[1:40:55.520 --> 1:40:59.040]  the bus and I'm gonna eat at that lunch counter and I'm gonna go take a crap in
[1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:02.360]  this bathroom if I want to instead of doing it in the alleyway because I'm a
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:11.600]  human being so find your guts find your heart and stop laying down where do the
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:16.000]  mountain lions eat people in trendy urban areas where everyone is scared and
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:20.960]  runs and falls down when I've read the police reports on people eaten by them
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:25.400]  they won't even fight back they'll just like just like an adjacent movie crawl
[1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:29.080]  backwards or runs of the woods and fall down if you just yelled at the cat would
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:33.320]  run away immediately but I watch TV all day and when woman's supposed to fall
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:43.800]  down and go but I bet that woman will blow up and scream and claw her husband
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:47.120]  and throw stuff around and roar at him because the only place he's supposed to
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:51.640]  have a human instinct is against her man when her man's supposed to be with her
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:56.920]  and him with her building their family finding other people to work with who
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:00.600]  were good to organize as good people against the bad people that are always
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:04.720]  out there but good people been taught how to not organize we've been caught how
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:09.720]  to lay down we've been taught it's good to bend over I'm not doing it anymore
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:15.600]  you put on my tombstone I didn't lay down I fought back I was red-blooded I
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:23.000]  was alive I saw evil I called it out there's so mad this is this this was the
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:27.880]  genesis of exposing Alcada being run by the West and the whole Syria thing that
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:31.160]  then senators covering everybody covered they're so hopping mad and shaking in
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:34.680]  their boots right now go ahead go ahead and try to take me out new world order
[1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:38.240]  I've already spread this information everywhere go ahead and try to assassinate
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:46.560]  my character man I love it I'm wanting it I expect it I got my charts flying
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:51.800]  right in over your bases I'm going right into your flak that's what it's all
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:43:06.640]  about I'm going to Derek Cindy Bill Truth Raider and Sandra and Truth Raider
[1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:09.360]  was on the other day when the show ended so I'm gonna go to Truth Raider first to
[1:43:09.360 --> 1:43:14.320]  finish up then I'm gonna go to Derek Cindy Bill and Sandra one reason I
[1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:17.520]  always say first time college is when I don't certain people get in first but
[1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:23.120]  we'll go to Truth Raider Truth Raider go ahead thank you sir and my fellow
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:27.280]  Patriot in the business of freedom hey you're talking to a famous person now
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:30.600]  and then I have an issue with LaRouche pack but I just want to tell you my
[1:43:30.600 --> 1:43:36.600]  little testimony really quick I filmed our local police officers are arresting
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:39.440]  but actually treating them the treating the person with respect they were
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:45.160]  drunk in public and after they but that took custody of the person and they asked
[1:43:45.160 --> 1:43:48.800]  me well would you mind giving us your name for our log this is yeah Truth Raider
[1:43:48.800 --> 1:43:54.040]  oh Truth Raider well I've seen your videos you know on YouTube yeah nice to
[1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:58.160]  meet you I'm a big fan of yours so a little bit of fame yeah one reason they
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:01.240]  show all the videos on the news that cops go on people with cameras is they
[1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:05.200]  don't want you to know most cops like it and so then you went out filmed and met
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:08.600]  cops that were your viewers that and you realize that you're having an effect
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:12.280]  see that's why I've gotten more pro police on average even though the courts
[1:44:12.280 --> 1:44:15.640]  are corrupt the feds are corrupt the systems rigged the average cops pretty
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:19.800]  good person on average and it's more awake than the public so I'm just like
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:24.080]  whoa that's a natural ally instead of us just fighting with each other why
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:29.760]  don't we try to back up the good cops exactly yeah the the officers here
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:33.160]  always when they see me they wave and they have the utmost respect for me I
[1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:36.040]  have respect for them so that you know it's just a rare situation we're
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:40.160]  actually the police you know are actually being peace officers well then
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:42.880]  they get respected and that's what it's all about but the globalists don't want
[1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:46.080]  the cops really know in the public and the public knowing them and liking them
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:50.720]  because then they're local they want to mean and scary so nobody interfaces with
[1:44:50.720 --> 1:44:55.320]  each other so that we're not all on the same team again they want to take the
[1:44:55.320 --> 1:44:59.880]  humanity out of us truth raider anything else yes LaRouche pack I have a
[1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:05.000]  little bit of a beef with them they call every once in a while and then they go
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:08.240]  through a spiel so I can listen to five ten minutes of what let me tell you
[1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:12.000]  there's big world issues going on I'm not part of LaRouche pack I disagree with
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:16.120]  a lot of their solutions I like their analysis of world events I too remember
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:21.480]  years ago they had a TV add-on about get a free subscription to their magazine and
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:26.440]  I was like in college had zero money and I thought oh I want that free thing and
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:29.880]  they have this little market to me as well but the show really is not about
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:33.320]  that I God bless you I appreciate your call we do a whole show and tell a
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:37.200]  marketing sometime if you'd like to though Derek in California Derek you're
[1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:42.000]  on the air yes I have two comments please first I live in northern California
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:47.160]  here and we have private mercenaries stealing marijuana second comment is
[1:45:47.160 --> 1:45:51.520]  that Scotland will become part of the new world order and I could prove it
[1:45:51.520 --> 1:45:56.040]  because Russia will gather all the communist nations America will gather
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:46:01.800]  all the democratic nations and all the religions will unite because if you I
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:08.360]  can prove this if you take the words Union Soviet Socialist Russia United
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:14.040]  States America and Pope Paul and turn the letters a equals one b equals two
[1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:20.800]  it equals 666 yeah but you could take you could take millions of word combos
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:26.200]  and computations and find the word 666 I mean it's like people take my name and
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:30.280]  mess with it and say that Alex Jones means something good or something bad
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:35.240]  well what about my real name Alexander and again it is also Terry the
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:40.440]  globalist are into numerology they are into some of that some of that stuff goes
[1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:44.240]  on but I'll tell you what's proof of world religion you've got the Pope and
[1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:48.400]  others getting ready to meet a call for a united nations of religions all
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:54.120]  together basically accepting one world religion and that sounds pretty bad to
[1:46:54.120 --> 1:47:00.200]  me that's so true now I'd like to plug Joseph Israel's radio show and my
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:04.080]  favorite reggae band top shelf and okay good I appreciate your call again we
[1:47:04.080 --> 1:47:06.880]  don't screen your calls because it makes it so interesting but it's like
[1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:13.000]  sometimes the calls get real weird which is kind of entertaining but I'd like to
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:20.080]  plug my favorite type of tea that I've been drinking Urumata I'll tell you is
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:24.880]  got a lot of caffeine in though I got to be careful or then I just start stuttering
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:30.000]  just keeping myself to two cups a day I tell you I like it so much that it's
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:35.080]  starting to displace my coffee intake some Cindy in Pennsylvania you're on the
[1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:39.880]  air go ahead yeah you know it makes no sense that they leave the borders wide
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:46.200]  open and this ISIS is running around yet they want to take our guns well if you
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:52.120]  watch two videos with Obama one was the one where he admitted his Muslim faith
[1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:57.640]  that's undeniable oh yeah out of his own mouth and then the second one is when
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:03.080]  he said he was gonna build an army of his own as well armed as well funded as
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:10.040]  the United States Army and I see that being ISIS am I wrong well yes the
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:15.120]  famous clip he said we domestic security force just as big just as strong as our
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:19.880]  military that's homeland security federalizing police and then having
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:27.800]  auxiliary groups like Akron and and and blue state project and others feeding in
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:31.760]  to the intelligence network and they operate as an organized crime syndicate
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:37.200]  so that's their domestic army there but yes in the Middle East and Africa and
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:42.180]  Asia they are going to use al-Qaeda under the name is or ISIS or is to
[1:48:42.180 --> 1:48:45.840]  confuse us away from McCain and others meeting with them that's that's all
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:54.120]  about and Lindsey Graham to change it over and then project it project it you
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:59.000]  know into any areas that they want to destabilize so yes al-Qaeda is the secret
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:04.880]  sword the skeleton key the army of death that serves the new world order and the
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:09.840]  great eye and I've been saying that for about 15 years before 9-11 and they will
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:14.320]  use Muslim extremists to bring the world down and then the answer will be
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:17.560]  the planetary police state like the borders wide open but they've got
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:21.800]  stingray systems everywhere stealing your cell phone data listening to you in
[1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:26.440]  real time you can buy one if you've got the money they're expensive and sit there
[1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:30.920]  and dial in and listen for miles and miles depending on how how high you
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:35.440]  are you go to a top of a building and put one of those in and just listen to
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:38.720]  10,000 people at once and just dial through what they're saying what they're
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:42.400]  doing tracking everything they got programs with similar systems not the
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:45.800]  only one where they can take control your phone and then if they can take
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:50.360]  control you they can then plant things on you so we're all being totally
[1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:55.440]  surveilled criminally illegally the NSA is using it to harass their wives and
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:00.680]  husbands local police departments are being given access it's because the
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:06.440]  criminal elements want a total ace in the hole over everybody to plant stuff on
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:10.520]  people to blackmail to lie and all they're gonna do is just credit the
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:15.200]  entire system and themselves in the process anything else we need to let
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:21.560]  the Latinos know with signs or whatever that max million is more like Obama and
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:26.960]  Hillary in that bunch we need to start associating their dictators with what
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:31.880]  they understand well I mean look Mexico's collapsed so you don't blame
[1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:35.560]  people coming up here but it doesn't matter it's like I don't blame you know
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:39.960]  people want to have a house and stuff but they can't have mine the globalist
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:45.440]  are bringing them here to be a political block to be a veto against the
[1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:50.040]  property lobby the family lobby the gun lobby the sovereignty lobby and they

[1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:26.480]  I was just thinking during the break look at a picture Hillary Clinton on
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:34.280]  info wars.com then a picture Queen Elizabeth the second I was thinking oh
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:40.480]  my gosh they could really try to make her a queen or something they said make her
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:43.680]  a queen or against women everyone would vote then to make her queen I mean a
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:47.800]  little bit sarcastic there but it's it's it's getting ridiculous I have been
[1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:53.080]  dealing with the Clintons and all of us have since 1993 they're horrible
[1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:57.800]  criminals it's just well-known liars involved in all sorts of swindles and
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:05.640]  scams and now most political analysts say she's got 55% chance of being the
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:13.840]  next president even though there's a huge Republican landslide coming the
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:16.960]  Republicans probably won't try to fix anything because they wrote most of it
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:22.560]  or involved in it on Obamacare any of it in the next two years when they have
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:25.800]  this big defeat take over the house with that they have the house but take over
[1:55:25.800 --> 1:55:35.280]  the Senate as well and that most women will end up going and voting for her
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:38.640]  because he's a woman which I really think could be arguable I mean I would
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:42.760]  vote for a woman like LePen or something that's more libertarian in a second I
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:48.040]  could care less we had a woman president I'd get down and you know cut her
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:50.920]  toenails and whatever if she wouldn't leave she just leave the second
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:54.880]  amendment alone I would vote for Hispanic woman for president if she had a
[1:55:54.880 --> 1:56:00.480]  background that she was for liberty in five seconds after I did the research
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:07.160]  to care less a black woman I don't care what color somebody is or if they're a
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:11.440]  man or a woman what I care about is what they stand for and Hillary Clinton is a
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:17.240]  monster and I'm not threatening to leave the country if she gets elected but I
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:20.640]  just can't handle it and I know they're all puppets people but I mean come on
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:27.200]  if America elect Hillary Clinton over a Rand Paul I'm gonna vomit but then I
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:29.840]  think well wait a minute he's a good guy they'll destroy him they could kill
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:33.160]  him they'll block everything he tries to do just let her come in and just make
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:38.480]  things worse and there's two different arguments there but I always go with
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:42.080]  what's moral I don't want to play politics and all let Hillary get in it'll
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:46.640]  be real good for talk radio business no it won't she'll pull a false flag and
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:50.720]  have my butt arrested they've already got the Justice Department crawling all
[1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:55.240]  around here as you want to throw up
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:00.480]  people like yeah though Justice Department's harassing anybody who's
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:04.360]  conservative or libertarian that's why you got to work 10 times harder because
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:07.800]  they're scared of us because they know we're taking the country back and you
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:10.720]  know why we're taking it back as everybody knows now we don't start
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:15.480]  taking stuff back very quickly it's over as a society Bill in Wisconsin thanks
[1:57:15.480 --> 1:57:20.320]  for holding her on the air got about two minutes yeah thanks Alex thanks for

[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:34.680]  and I go through literal hell every time we have a meeting because I bring out
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:40.520]  information that you put in your magazine I bring out information against
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:48.360]  Gardasil for instance I have a rather lengthy article in the local paper that
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:52.680]  if people wanted I'm gonna do this I'm gonna come back to you the next five
[1:57:52.680 --> 1:57:56.160]  minutes that little no man's land that some stations carry I'm gonna air that
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:57:58.920]  Ebola special report one more time because folks have asked for that to
[1:57:58.920 --> 1:58:02.160]  re-air that that Mr. Der all your apartment come to you at eight after
[1:58:02.160 --> 1:58:05.840]  just restart and tell your old story I've seen news articles about you you've
[1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:09.720]  been listening about 15 years you ended up running because I was saying people
[1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:13.280]  should run you're an example of what I was talking about with James Cargill
[1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:21.560]  earlier Michael Cargill running against Mike Martinez because that's the answer
[1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:27.800]  is that run against these anti-gun mayors run against or get on a commission
[1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:31.520]  and then you can really expose what's happening and this is a guy that did it
[1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:37.480]  so Bill will come back to you coming up then Sandra John Tim and others and a
[1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:42.320]  special guest they are really going after libertarian lawyers Chuck Baldwin

[2:00:19.840 --> 2:00:25.480]  like the perfect script for a horror movie a virus with no vaccine and no
[2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:31.920]  cure kills thousands of people by being people died in 1996 and 1997
[2:00:31.920 --> 2:00:36.960]  the most the entire population of the world
[2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:42.440]  they about 1% of us survived reports of flu cases along the border but officials
[2:00:42.440 --> 2:00:46.400]  are seeing the art connected surely there's very real and very convincing
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:50.240]  data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race and I
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:54.320]  actually think the world will be much better when there's only 10 or 20% of
[2:00:54.320 --> 2:00:59.240]  us left dr. Eric Bianca but most frightening was the fact that in a
[2:00:59.240 --> 2:01:06.200]  crowd of over 1,000 prominent scientists local newspapers reported that 95% of
[2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:12.080]  those in attendance gave Bianca sustained standing ovations every time
[2:01:12.080 --> 2:01:18.160]  he extoll the virtues of mass culling microbes and man's destruction and when
[2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:22.240]  on the law the virtues of Ebola because it would kill 90% of the world
[2:01:22.240 --> 2:01:27.320]  population quickly the World Health Organization said on Tuesday the Ebola
[2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:33.560]  death toll jumped by almost 200 in a single day to at least 2296 and is
[2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:37.600]  likely to be higher than that the head of the US Centers for Disease Control
[2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:43.080]  confirmed Tuesday that West Africa is in desperate situation but that there is
[2:01:43.080 --> 2:01:47.920]  still hope that the auto break can be written a top German virologist has
[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:53.120]  caused shockwaves by asserting that it's too late to halt the spread of the
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:58.160]  Ebola virus in other news the CDC is receiving reports of a possible flu
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:02.280]  outbreak in San Francisco if the symptoms were first detected in
[2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:08.000]  Philadelphia on December 27 1996 that makes us know that it was released in
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.200]  Philadelphia probably on December 13 1996 and we'll see sequentially after that
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:19.040]  year San Francisco New Orleans Rio de Janeiro
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:28.400]  Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:34.640]  some trip you're taking sir is this all in one week business one of the two
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:39.920]  Americans infected with the Ebola virus has arrived in Atlanta from Africa for
[2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:43.840]  treatment the Massachusetts doctor arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center
[2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:48.760]  just before dawn this morning to be treated for Ebola and right now his or
[2:02:48.760 --> 2:02:53.720]  her blood sample is on its way to the Centers for Disease Control new ability
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:59.840]  to wage war is born from the blood of one of the victims there you see also
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:06.400]  invisible to the naked eye it doesn't even have an odor
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:11.840]  imagine a virus the most terrifying virus you can and then imagine that you
[2:03:11.840 --> 2:03:17.600]  are too alone of the cure without specific drugs or a vaccine for Ebola the
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:22.000]  only thing doctors can do for those suffering from this disease is treat
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:28.320]  their symptoms Ebola is not airborne one will not likely catch the virus just
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:35.360]  by nearing someone who has it in 1989 Ebola made its way to the U.S. this new
[2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:40.400]  strain of Ebola had shown the potential to spread through the air
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:48.560]  still no cure no cure the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given 31
[2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:53.400]  million pounds to help battle the Ebola epidemic in Africa it is hoped it will
[2:03:53.400 --> 2:03:57.320]  also speed up the development of drugs and vaccines as Ebola has killed more
[2:03:57.320 --> 2:04:03.400]  than half of its 4,300 victims first we've got population now if we do a
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:08.640]  really great job on new vaccines healthcare we could lower that by
[2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:13.320]  perhaps 10 or 15 percent a preventative vaccine for the Ebola virus could be
[2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:17.360]  available as early as next year as British pharma company GlaxoSmith
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:23.400]  Klein so you want to balance the need to get a potentially effective vaccine to
[2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:27.640]  the people who need it in a way that you can get some meaningful information as
[2:04:27.640 --> 2:04:33.200]  to a whether it does work or not and whether it does harm a confidential
[2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:36.440]  GlaxoSmith Klein document recently linked to the press exposed that within a
[2:04:36.440 --> 2:04:41.560]  two-year period a total of 36 infants died after receiving the six-in-one
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:49.280]  vaccine of infrex hexa probably one of these numbers is gonna have to get
[2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:55.520]  pretty near to zero attention due to the extremity of the Simeon flu crisis all
[2:04:55.520 --> 2:05:01.080]  regular government functions have been suspended from the water table to our

[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:45.680]  corporations that run it the answer to this is multifaceted but people like
[2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:49.840]  Bill again I've seen newspaper clippings where he's been fighting
[2:09:49.840 --> 2:09:52.880]  fluoridation in the water and getting stuff done and a lot of things I forget
[2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:56.000]  your last name bill you can announce it but Bill's been listed like 15 years or
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:00.560]  more I remember when he ran for office got in as a county commissioner up there
[2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:06.080]  they call that in Texas I guess they call it a county official or supervisor
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:11.440]  up in Wisconsin and he's gotten a lot done and I was talking earlier about we
[2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:15.160]  all need to run against people that are anti-gun we need to run against people
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:18.720]  that are pro-terrifying we need to run against people that are anti-
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:23.720]  constitution and even if we don't win we educate people during the debates you
[2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:28.400]  get on television you get on the radio and you also scare them and let them
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:32.840]  know there's political opposition forming that's why they want to audit all
[2:10:32.840 --> 2:10:36.880]  the tea party people and scare everyone they think that if they mess with you
[2:10:36.880 --> 2:10:40.560]  that you're just gonna go in a ditch well if we don't stand up to them they're
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:45.320]  gonna take everything already it's the bullies are already beating us up might
[2:10:45.320 --> 2:10:47.960]  as well fight back
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:54.600]  so going back to Bill Bill what's your name because I've known you over the
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:57.680]  years but I forget it and tell folks your story and then tell us the latest
[2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:07.440]  info okay my name is Bill Zeitz I ran for town chairman when I was in ill
[2:11:07.440 --> 2:11:14.560]  health against smart growth and my slogan was Zeitz fights for your property
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:22.040]  rights and it you know it took hold then I ran for county supervisor and I was
[2:11:22.040 --> 2:11:29.040]  elected in both cases I defeated individuals that had lived here their
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:35.840]  entire lives so it is possible to move into an area and just start going to
[2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:42.560]  meetings and speaking up so exactly I would elect a Chinese immigrant from
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:46.480]  seven years ago that had just become a US citizen if they were pro-liberty and
[2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:50.720]  had a history we could trust and stood up for private property and guns I don't
[2:11:50.720 --> 2:11:54.840]  care and people don't care where you're from anymore they just want you to do
[2:11:54.840 --> 2:12:02.160]  something go ahead all right anyway when I was elected to the county they did
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:07.480]  not want to put me on any of the powerful committee so they put me on the
[2:12:07.480 --> 2:12:12.600]  board of health and I immediately started to bring out stuff about the
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:20.040]  pharmaceutical industries about the vaccines and they didn't like that so
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:27.000]  after one of the elections they threw me off the board of health so I brought a
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:35.280]  resolution forward to reinstate me and it took three months until finally you
[2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:41.960]  know someone changed their vote it was 11 to 11 every time and then finally one
[2:12:41.960 --> 2:12:47.680]  of the supervisors changed the vote so I'm back on there now we we had a good
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:55.280]  doctor that was on there I had a Ron Paul buddy that just passed away and you
[2:12:55.280 --> 2:13:01.480]  know I was bringing out a lot of information on the agenda and the doctor
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:08.800]  was fired he was working with Marshfield Clinic I don't know exactly maybe it was
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:13.440]  a cost-cutting measure but I kind of know they do come after you because when
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:16.760]  you do the right thing you're cutting in on their whole criminal op they can make
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:20.360]  tens of millions a year in one county just off the vaccines they're shooting
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:23.800]  in the kids so you're not being there good little operatives you're basically
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:28.040]  just telling folks about the fights that happen behind the scenes oh yeah yeah
[2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:35.560]  and believe me it goes on so anyway the new doctor is a pharmaceutical
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:43.200]  creature he supports the CDC we just you know go to the mat almost every meeting
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:50.200]  so they didn't want me putting things on the agenda fine so what I do now is under
[2:13:50.200 --> 2:13:56.840]  public comment I bring out articles and information there so they also said well
[2:13:56.840 --> 2:14:02.520]  write something for the local paper so I did and if people want to take a look at
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:15.320]  it the local paper you can read it online is Meryl M-E-R-R-I-L-L photo news F-O-T-O
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:21.640]  dot com Meryl photo news yeah listen the best way to plug an article is to give
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:25.040]  us the headline that's how people will find it it's called the void the
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:31.200]  Gardasil vaccine by Bill Zeitz County Supervisor we're gonna post it
[2:14:31.200 --> 2:14:36.040]  jamfallwars.com and syndicate it galactic and we've got your County
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:40.840]  Commissioner profile up on the screen and again if I remember correctly I saw
[2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:44.360]  other articles years ago when you first did this I don't know five six years ago
[2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:51.200]  didn't you guys stop Agenda 21 because of what you did well we did in in the
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:56.960]  town you know in other words we had an opportunity to pull out of Connie's
[2:14:56.960 --> 2:15:04.920]  owning when I got elected and that was my position so we pulled out of Connie's
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:12.760]  owning we set up our own very lenient town zoning and the people love it but
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:18.880]  see you did it and in a whole county you restored liberty on a key area and if
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:22.800]  people would just do what you did I know it took some work and things but let me
[2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:26.720]  guess has it not been animating have you not had more energy if you not felt
[2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:29.800]  better you said you were in bad health when you first did this I mean has it
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:33.920]  not been better for your life because in my experience fighting tyranny is so
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:39.440]  enjoyable it's not work it just puts a spring in my step I just can't wait to
[2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:43.160]  fight the tyrants and I want people to realize this is what we're made for if
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:48.240]  we don't go become the government if we don't go in there the bad guys are we
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:52.520]  just sit here and complain all day we have to go engage we have to go take it
[2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:59.640]  back absolutely and you know one other item I'd like to bring up on ISIS
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:08.160]  Alex I think you know Netanyahu and in Israel kind of like ISIS I think I've
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:13.320]  read enough quotes where you know they kind of support them and they sit back
[2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:20.120]  and they let these globalists come in and support them financially cause ruin
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:25.400]  you know in in that part of the world and I think at some point you know
[2:16:25.400 --> 2:16:32.200]  Israel's gonna mop it all up I honestly believe that it's a mess I tell you I
[2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:36.520]  appreciate your call it is just such a mess appreciate the call Bill good to
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:42.600]  hear from you Alex in Canada you're on the air hi Alex hey brother hi um I
[2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:51.480]  first of all I gotta say I agree with about 98 99% of what you say well that's good because I don't I hear rebroadcasts and I
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:55.680]  didn't say that writer I meant to say this I probably agree with about 95% of
[2:16:55.680 --> 2:17:02.080]  what I say because you so so wow I'm impressed go ahead I want to talk about
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:08.200]  the disassociation between men women and how put into the depopulation yes
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:14.280]  they've created a disassociation and a war between men and women that that is
[2:17:14.280 --> 2:17:18.160]  designed to make the state the daddy and basically in the human species as we
[2:17:18.160 --> 2:17:22.080]  know it and it's in major textbooks and it's work like a charm they make women's
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:25.960]  identity that they're women and they're in a war with men and they make men's
[2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:31.920]  identity the same thing and it's a total disaster and yeah and Alex one of the
[2:17:31.920 --> 2:17:35.880]  biggest growing businesses in the Western world is the pickup artists where
[2:17:35.880 --> 2:17:42.000]  guys are teaching with men how to teach how to pick up other women but the
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.960]  problem with this is there's a lot of mist manipulation and where other guys
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:49.240]  are taking advantage of weak men I was about to say you can only pick up
[2:17:49.240 --> 2:17:55.720]  really stupid women with that stuff and it does work but it doesn't end well but
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:18:03.320]  it is true that that biologically it's it's a confidence game and that I mean
[2:18:03.320 --> 2:18:09.080]  even really good women on average like to be treated bad and and you know at
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:12.280]  least you got to be standoffish and distant sometimes or they don't respect
[2:18:12.280 --> 2:18:18.000]  you and it's biological well yeah exactly and yeah because like there is a
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:21.760]  disassociation between men women and like I don't have this problem anymore I
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:28.320]  used to but I do think it plays into a depopulation agenda because of I mean it
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:33.480]  does play into the population between into the New World Order because guys
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:36.600]  honestly there's huge epidemic where guys don't know how to communicate with
[2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:39.840]  women and if guys don't know how to communicate with women then there's I
[2:18:39.840 --> 2:18:47.040]  mean people aren't making babies like they used to well yeah like some guys
[2:18:47.040 --> 2:18:51.880]  do but there's a huge epidemic where guys are so timid and so coward and so
[2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:55.760]  like I was wondering maybe if you could like just break it down little because
[2:18:55.760 --> 2:18:58.640]  you always do you always talk about how you could get with women and stuff like
[2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:02.120]  that like I said I don't have a problem with this most of you well I mean I'm a
[2:19:02.120 --> 2:19:06.880]  family man and it's not like I'm some casting over anything I just I just love
[2:19:06.880 --> 2:19:11.240]  I love women I mean I women are just beautiful wonderful creatures and they
[2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:15.280]  just want somebody that's happy and confident and wants to tell jokes and go
[2:19:15.280 --> 2:19:23.280]  on hikes and you know go to like little stores and stuff little antique stores
[2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:28.680]  just piddling around that's what women like to do and I just want my daughters
[2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:31.920]  to grow up healthy and happy and to have good strong men out there for them to
[2:19:31.920 --> 2:19:35.880]  meet and love and continue the cycle and and men and women have to understand
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:39.640]  we're all bound eternally together we are the human species and that's all
[2:19:39.640 --> 2:19:43.800]  under attack in traditional roles are out there and people genuinely want that
[2:19:43.800 --> 2:19:48.720]  that's their issue they're artificially attacking the standard roles of men and
[2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:53.560]  women and it's in major textbooks in-game 2.0 breaks it down where they
[2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:57.000]  said that they would do this in the 50s and they've done it and boy it isn't
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  pretty is it they'll be back our big story gun owners react as politicians
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:07.320]  continue to ban high-capacity magazines state-by-state I think that these

[2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:11.920]  toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:15.760]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90 percent of their
[2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:20.040]  time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42
[2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:24.120]  million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and
[2:21:24.120 --> 2:21:28.120]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[2:21:28.120 --> 2:21:31.280]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:35.320]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my

[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:24.240]  offering think about it think about how our country is suffering because other
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:27.400]  countries don't want to do business with us because they don't trust the fact
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:35.120]  that Google and all its subsidiaries and things like Amazon aren't working with
[2:24:35.120 --> 2:24:41.880]  the NSA they are the NSA and that's what Jack Ma said about it he said we've got
[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:45.560]  the trust of the people worldwide that we're not basically doing things like
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:51.720]  that so that's the problem having these criminals run our country is that people
[2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:55.560]  wanted to do business with us before because we were the good guys and not
[2:24:55.560 --> 2:24:59.240]  that we were perfect but America wanted to promote liberty and freedom and and
[2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:02.680]  the second amendment and why that's why you wanted to go there you can be left
[2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:08.360]  alone by government bureaucrats and now we're the opposite and weren't like 36th
[2:25:08.360 --> 2:25:14.800]  in the world now for business freedom saw a study last week people don't want
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:18.880]  to that's behind every industrialized country and then some we're in bad
[2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:23.720]  shade let's get this straight and it's all fun for the bureaucrats and then
[2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:28.720]  regulators and the lawyers and the academics and everybody until the
[2:25:28.720 --> 2:25:34.320]  gravy train stops ladies and gentlemen Alibaba's IPO prices at top of range
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:40.040]  raising twenty one point eight billion dollars boom a guy that came from
[2:25:40.040 --> 2:25:43.000]  nothing and why is it always somebody that comes from nothing that has the
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:48.560]  big innovation and it's certainly never somebody with a college degree and I'm
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:53.560]  not bashing college degrees there's some reasons for them in some areas but the
[2:25:53.560 --> 2:25:56.560]  big innovations come out of people that are thinking outside the box just like
[2:25:56.560 --> 2:26:02.360]  in force just like drudge just like so many other platforms let's go ahead and
[2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:07.760]  go to our guest in the short segment to break down some of what's happening then
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:11.680]  we'll get the details in the next segment and this is bigger than just
[2:26:11.680 --> 2:26:21.640]  Montana or Texas this is this is this is serious because you see demonization
[2:26:21.640 --> 2:26:25.920]  of patriots and Liberty levers all the time and it's been happening so much
[2:26:25.920 --> 2:26:28.320]  now we've kind of gotten used to it's not a big deal anymore when it happens
[2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:31.320]  you hear about judges in the news saying I don't allow the Constitution in my
[2:26:31.320 --> 2:26:35.320]  courtroom well they should be forced to stand down they violated their oath it
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:38.800]  was six years ago I got the secret document that for about a week people
[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:42.440]  didn't believe until the government finally responded in us today and other
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:46.040]  publications saying no that's a real document saying Ron Paul's basically a
[2:26:46.040 --> 2:26:50.840]  terrorist Chuck Baldwin's terrorist Adam Russo's an evil person for his film
[2:26:50.840 --> 2:26:55.880]  libertarians are bad the if you want to get out of the UN you're bad you know
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:01.360]  these are terrorists basically and now it's so ubiquitous that we're just oh
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:05.880]  that's no big deal well he's got quite a story to tell Dr. Chuck Baldwin's
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:11.320]  joined by his constitutional attorney son Tim Baldwin they're also co-authors of
[2:27:11.320 --> 2:27:16.400]  multiple books that we happen to sell Romans 13 and more and they are joining
[2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:21.920]  us right now he's with flathead legal comm Tim Baldwin and his father Chuck
[2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:25.640]  joins us we're going to break in a few minutes guys but I saw it in local
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:29.360]  newspapers lawyers want state to investigate prosecutors and then I
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:33.800]  heard part of the story through my producer that they're actually with
[2:27:33.800 --> 2:27:37.360]  straight faces going you know basically saying you're not allowed to promote the
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:41.120]  Constitution that it's evil somehow and doing a lot of really weird stuff in
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:45.120]  their drug task force so thanks for joining us who should speak first
[2:27:45.120 --> 2:27:50.720]  Chuck Baldwin or Tim Baldwin I think Tim should go ahead and take it to try to
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:56.640]  give you some of the background Alex yeah Tim give us a basic snapshot yeah so
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:00.760]  for your audience's information on this I'm a criminal defense attorney and
[2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:05.840]  Flathead County Montana and I practice in other counties as well I have a case
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:13.120]  so I had a case involving a client of mine where we discovered evidence that
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:22.040]  the Northwest Drug Task Force agent and a county attorney here were threatening
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:28.960]  my client's wife and my client to fire me as my client's attorney and they
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:34.720]  threatened that if they do not fire me it would be bad for my client we actually
[2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:39.040]  got a recorded statement or another statement but a recorded conversation
[2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:45.360]  that my client's wife released here recently that actually shows the
[2:28:45.360 --> 2:28:51.560]  egregiousness of what was going on here and the reason that that was revealed
[2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:57.800]  from this officer who was talking to my client's wife was that they they do not
[2:28:57.800 --> 2:29:04.840]  like Jim Baldwin they reference my dad running for president in 2008 under the
[2:29:04.840 --> 2:29:09.840]  Constitution ticket they reference being a constitutionalist as they called it
[2:29:09.840 --> 2:29:14.720]  they reference me defending my clients right to bigger Tim I want to stop right
[2:29:14.720 --> 2:29:17.200]  there because we're gonna come back from break I'm gonna give you both the
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:20.520]  floor I want to walk through what happened with the case we have the audio
[2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:25.160]  I'm gonna put in a nightly news report soon so it's more congruent but but this
[2:29:25.160 --> 2:29:28.360]  is how the state is to operate they could be Republicans or Democrats these are
[2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:33.640]  Republicans in this case is they want to shut business down shut freedom down
[2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:37.960]  shut people's right to a lawyer down because of our views there's an attempt
[2:29:37.960 --> 2:29:42.840]  to shut us up shut us down and it's what the Nazis did in the buildup to World
[2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:47.480]  War two inside Germany it's how tyranny first starts and this is just boots on
[2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:51.360]  the ground evil we'll be right back on the mark stay with us the empires on the

[2:33:48.200 --> 2:33:52.280]  willing don't take any of this for granted this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central
[2:33:52.280 --> 2:33:57.040]  standard time with a Sunday worldwide transmission so the headline lawyers
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:34:02.720]  want state to investigate prosecutors and the audio of it has been released and
[2:34:02.720 --> 2:34:10.280]  why this story is so important is this is local police involve threatening
[2:34:10.280 --> 2:34:16.680]  someone who's been charged saying you better get rid of your lawyer because
[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:19.400]  you're not supposed to be talking to somebody once there's a criminal case
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:24.600]  going on and you're the officer involved get involved in the trial and this is
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:29.640]  just incredible it's official intimidation there they're saying
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:33.040]  because they're constitutionalist that's the guy that ran for president that's
[2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:35.760]  the guy politically involved that's the guy that thousands of people are
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:41.200]  listening to locally you you don't work with him and you know this is going on
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:44.960]  everywhere else these are probably the hundredth people they've done this too
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:50.360]  and they just happened to not lie down to it and record it so you got a defense
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:55.600]  attorney totally protected under the Constitution absolutely sacred and
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:58.760]  they're going to people saying you better let them go or you're in deep
[2:34:58.760 --> 2:35:03.360]  trouble so we can throw you in prison you're not allowed to defense and these
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:07.120]  cops are doing this with a straight face with the prosecutor that's called
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:11.800]  tyrants that reminds me of the cases up in Williamson County where they'll have
[2:35:11.800 --> 2:35:16.600]  a known person who's innocent there's been movies made about it and have the
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:21.360]  bloody rag and they even know the killer is just for some reason they just want
[2:35:21.360 --> 2:35:24.800]  to put an innocent man with no criminal record in jail because his wife's been
[2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:31.760]  killed and they knew all along it's a very sick so imagine people are like
[2:35:31.760 --> 2:35:34.840]  yeah if you get involved in the tea party or anything you won't get business
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:38.160]  you won't because if we all start giving each other business if you start
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:42.520]  giving publications business or info wars.com business or our shopping cart
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:46.080]  business or spread the word about other websites that tell the truth we'll build
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:50.800]  our own community and our community will be popular and people want to hang out
[2:35:50.800 --> 2:35:55.200]  with folks that are into freedom and pretty soon we'll take the country back
[2:35:55.200 --> 2:36:00.880]  just like 1776 but economically and culturally so there's a culture war
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:05.960]  against pro-lifers veterans look at how the veterans are being demonized think
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:10.520]  about a coalition the veterans the returning veterans the libertarians
[2:36:10.520 --> 2:36:14.480]  the conservatives the Christians that want real Christianity not state-run
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:19.720]  propaganda think if we come together and start working together and and praying
[2:36:19.720 --> 2:36:24.520]  together and shopping together and teaching each other skills and going out
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:28.840]  and camping together and just creating community again that's what'll kill the
[2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:34.600]  New World Order is normal human community I'm gonna shut up now but they try to
[2:36:34.600 --> 2:36:38.200]  build all community around their state run systems they don't want us to have

[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:44.760]  libertarian thought an icon of goodness no one would dare claim he's bad in any
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:51.680]  way a medical doctor vietnam veteran demonized they demonize good men folks
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:56.240]  because they want to cause a civil war in this country between the police and
[2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:01.520]  the military and the constitutionalist movement and that's why they want to
[2:38:01.520 --> 2:38:04.760]  demonize Chuck Baldwin and it's again you're like oh it's just some local
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:08.400]  thing and some cops no this is systematic now Tim I'm gonna shut up you
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:11.120]  guys have got the floor you break it down and then throw it to your dad whenever
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:16.160]  you want okay so you know again I represent a person by the name of Corey
[2:38:16.160 --> 2:38:19.840]  Franklin and keep in mind this case was assigned to me from the public
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:23.680]  defender's office I have a contract with the state of Montana to represent
[2:38:23.680 --> 2:38:29.560]  client to the public defender's office either cannot for for conflict reasons
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:33.280]  or for overflow work but this is a contract case from the public defender's
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:37.880]  office my client had another attorney prior to my representation of him I
[2:38:37.880 --> 2:38:42.460]  took his cases over there are two cases whenever I received this case
[2:38:42.460 --> 2:38:50.880]  Ken Park was I learned that Ken Park was the prosecutor in this case and so as
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:55.120]  any attorney would do I'm looking at the cases and I find out that there's
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:59.440]  hardly any discovery in the files there was many items missing in the file such
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:05.800]  as my client's own statements that were recorded witness statements photographs
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:10.560]  of the crime scene all kinds of essential discovery was missing so I sent
[2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:16.080]  a message to Mr. Park and I said I'm you know I need this discovery I also had
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:20.400]  learned from the prior attorney and my client that there was discussion about
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:25.440]  Mr. Park dismissing one of the cases because it was actually very weak in
[2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:31.480]  fact in fact Mr. Park admitted this under oath on September 5th that he
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:34.920]  didn't believe he could prove this case beyond the reasonable doubt of jury yet
[2:39:34.920 --> 2:39:39.720]  he kept prosecuting this case and then how dare a lawyer try to actually do his
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:43.760]  job think of it in the public defender actually did their job they couldn't be
[2:39:43.760 --> 2:39:48.400]  throwing all these innocent people in jail please continue so I so I sent him
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:52.720]  this email asking for discovery asking him if he was going to dismiss the one
[2:39:52.720 --> 2:39:57.720]  case well I get a response from him where he tells me that if I file any
[2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:02.280]  motion on behalf of my client that he would seek the maximum penalty against
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:05.520]  my client and that he would also encourage the federal government to charge
[2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:11.240]  my client with a charge there was no factual basis for after I received that
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:15.840]  email from Mr. Park it became very apparent to me that Mr. Park had a
[2:40:15.840 --> 2:40:20.680]  personal grudge a personal bias against me because his response was so
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:25.200]  arbitrary and really unreasonable given the fact that discovery had not even
[2:40:25.200 --> 2:40:29.760]  really been sure before you know the minutiae the key here is then they send
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:33.880]  the cops out to the client to say it's because you're constitutionalist that's
[2:40:33.880 --> 2:40:38.240]  the really big enchilada for me get into that okay I'm getting there so what
[2:40:38.240 --> 2:40:42.600]  happened was after that he sent me that email I had a conversation with my
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:47.760]  client's wife and she told me that she had talked to Mr. Park about his
[2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:52.000]  dismissing one of the cases because she even knew that same thing well she told
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:55.800]  me that during this conversation he told her and she felt enough if she felt
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:00.520]  enough for David to this effect that since Tim Baldwin is your husband's
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:05.760]  attorney he will not get any favorable treatment for me whatsoever and in fact
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:10.560]  I'm going to make sure that he doesn't get favorable treatment because Tim
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:16.440]  Baldwin is his attorney and she felt an affidavit to that effect well my client's
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:21.200]  wife became very she became afraid actually from the intimidation that she
[2:41:21.200 --> 2:41:27.400]  received from this prosecutor she felt so concerned and so worried that Mr.
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:31.560]  Park in the county attorney's office would be going after her husband that
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:36.080]  she was pleading with her husband to fire me as his attorney at that that
[2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:40.320]  phone call was recorded by the county jail I received a copy of that later and
[2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:45.280]  you can hear her desperation telling your her husband you don't want Tim
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:49.360]  Baldwin because they're gonna come after you you're gonna be treated badly and I
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:52.480]  can't afford to lose you for the rest of the know clearly depending on the state
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:57.800]  law it's illegal to say get another lawyer and we'll go easier on you
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:01.600]  because then they can only say go get our buddy who's a lawyer and control the
[2:42:01.600 --> 2:42:06.200]  market of lawyers I mean this violates so many things as you guys are saying
[2:42:06.200 --> 2:42:09.600]  in the newspaper why do you think this is illegal because of course more than
[2:42:09.600 --> 2:42:13.920]  happened well first of all there was a case actually that my where my law
[2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:19.640]  associates help um all astute about where the judges were controlling which
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:23.240]  attorneys could get work in the county for the public defender's office sure
[2:42:23.240 --> 2:42:29.200]  and she my partner Phyllis Quodman and her husband Jack Quodman
[2:42:29.200 --> 2:42:34.840]  pop astute the ACLU got involved and what ended up happening was the system
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:38.760]  was completely changed because the judges cannot control who the attorneys
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:43.440]  are and the judges cannot control which client hire which attorneys and not to
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:47.160]  mention the fact of course that every person has a right to counsel the
[2:42:47.160 --> 2:42:51.080]  attorney client privilege is one of the most sacred institutions in protections
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:55.240]  we have in this country based on the most fundamental idea of a fairness and
[2:42:55.240 --> 2:42:59.160]  due process sure judicial system and I mean now we've got the parallel
[2:42:59.160 --> 2:43:02.760]  construction NSA spying everybody knows the courts are getting more and more
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:08.880]  rigged and here is an inside example of that please continue so what so what
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:12.920]  happened then after after she became so concerned about this and but her husband
[2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:16.880]  was insistent no I'm going to keep Tim Baldwin as my attorney I like him he's
[2:43:16.880 --> 2:43:21.600]  working hard for me I trust him I am not going to count how to mr. Park's
[2:43:21.600 --> 2:43:26.240]  intimidation and his threats against me so that's what happened so as a result
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:31.440]  of this scenario my client's wife decided that to protect herself from
[2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:37.120]  these threats that she received she was going to record a conversation or the
[2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:40.640]  next conversation she had with the state officials and in fact that's what
[2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:45.160]  happened she had talked to Mickey John's who is an agent for the Northwest
[2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:50.440]  Drug Task Force team who happened to be her handler because she was a
[2:43:50.440 --> 2:43:55.080]  confidential informant for the for the drug task force she talked to him on
[2:43:55.080 --> 2:43:58.920]  June 4th and during that conversation and that's the recording that you have
[2:43:58.920 --> 2:44:03.040]  and that's what we but that's what's been released to the public now but
[2:44:03.040 --> 2:44:09.280]  during that 27 minute conversation you hear this this officer do the exact
[2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:14.000]  same thing that mr. Park had done to my client's wife except it was recorded so
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:19.080]  we know exactly what he said and we see the correlation between what the county
[2:44:19.080 --> 2:44:24.320]  attorney's office had said to my client's wife and what the personal
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:27.800]  experiences that I had already been encountering with the county attorney's
[2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:32.880]  office all of that tied together to what this agent was telling my client's
[2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:38.720]  wife where he makes repeated threats about if she doesn't fire Tim Baldwin if
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:42.400]  Corey Franklin doesn't fire Tim Baldwin it's going to be bad news for Corey
[2:44:42.400 --> 2:44:47.280]  Franklin that you know he's gonna he's this is manipulating the judicial
[2:44:47.280 --> 2:44:51.760]  process trying to manipulate a trial from my research at your constitutional
[2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:56.720]  lawyer isn't this if proven and we have the tapes isn't it really a felony well
[2:44:56.720 --> 2:45:01.600]  I think under federal law you there's political corrupt corruption acts that
[2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:04.640]  you could file an under you know that's interesting that you bring that up
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:09.360]  because we saw the complaint with the AG's office the attempt Tim Fox is our
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:14.840]  attorney general here in Montana and we ask them to investigate this matter to
[2:45:14.840 --> 2:45:20.200]  look into what kind of reprimand or or what kind of action would need to be
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:24.520]  taken to correct the situation now we got a response yesterday late afternoon I
[2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:28.080]  haven't I haven't seen it yet but my staff tells you that they received it
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:32.280]  and that they have decided that they were not going to pursue criminal
[2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:36.520]  charges against Ed Corgan the county attorney here and the deputy county
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:40.120]  attorney Ken Park however they did say that what we had provided was very
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:44.560]  troubling and that they had forwarded the information to the proper or should I
[2:45:44.560 --> 2:45:50.360]  say the the authority that we have to correct attorneys in our state well
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:52.840]  here's the deal some listeners may be saying why do we care this is something
[2:45:52.840 --> 2:45:57.160]  out in Montana this is going on everywhere this is the demonization of
[2:45:57.160 --> 2:46:02.600]  liberty movement and when they do this stuff in my view it's corrupt it looks
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:06.320]  like it's violating some laws we have to get back on their face that's what'll
[2:46:06.320 --> 2:46:11.680]  make them start behaving instead of just oh you'll not let me operate and you'll
[2:46:11.680 --> 2:46:15.960]  shut us down if we follow the Constitution I mean go over specifically
[2:46:15.960 --> 2:46:19.000]  what's on this tape we have time to air the whole 27 minutes but I mean he's
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:22.560]  there going he's a constitutionalist he's a libertarian I mean like it's like
[2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:26.240]  it's like saying he's a child molester he's a bank robber he's a I mean it's
[2:46:26.240 --> 2:46:31.960]  just oh it's so horrible why that Alex Jones promotes auditing the Fed I mean
[2:46:31.960 --> 2:46:37.680]  it's just oh it's so horrible they they want their families to be free it's so
[2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:41.560]  weird how they act like we're dirty words or something when they're the ones
[2:46:41.560 --> 2:46:46.400]  that are un-American from their actions well throughout this 27 minute
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:50.280]  conversation there's a consistent theme throughout and the consistent theme is
[2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:56.600]  this first of all Tim Baldwin pushes too hard for his client he he files
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:47:00.880]  defense motions and he doesn't work well with the county attorney's office one
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:05.760]  of the statements and he doesn't roll over and help us set up people that's
[2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:09.880]  what he said exactly he said he said every other attorney here it's along
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:13.920]  with us and we get along with them and we all try to find a deal that works
[2:47:13.920 --> 2:47:18.080]  well for you guys but Tim Baldwin doesn't do that and he makes it really hard
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:21.960]  on all of it so that's one of the very and I that's almost a horrible you
[2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:26.640]  actually are a real lawyer that's just very bad yeah well he says other
[2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:30.840]  things like you know Tim Baldwin has his own political agenda Tim Baldwin
[2:47:30.840 --> 2:47:35.320]  is out for himself he's gonna hurt you he's gonna hurt your family he's gonna
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:39.120]  hurt your children he brings up the fact that my dad ran for president under
[2:47:39.120 --> 2:47:43.680]  some bull crap ticket which he didn't use the word crap under some bull crap
[2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:48.160]  ticket he said that Tim Baldwin is some kind of a what do you call it oh he's a
[2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:53.080]  constitutionalist demonizing the fact that I stand up for the rights of my
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:56.560]  client hey there's an article today we're a major school district refused
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:00.360]  pocket constitutions to be donated and then there was a backlash and they took
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:05.280]  them see we need to keep pushing to then make them refuse them to point out
[2:48:05.280 --> 2:48:09.040]  what traders they are we don't lay down you know just hoping they'll be our
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:13.160]  friends they're the radicals I want to bring your dad in here Chuck Baldwin I
[2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:17.000]  mean Chuck you heard my rant earlier isn't this a window into the quiet
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:21.440]  whisper campaign going on against the Liberty Movement behind the scenes this
[2:48:21.440 --> 2:48:25.680]  is this is blatant and what is so amazing about this is as you've already
[2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:31.520]  noted this kind of thing goes on all the time but here is the the significant
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:36.960]  part of this story is the evidence was dumped in Tim's lap this this is what
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:40.400]  makes this so spectacular it's one thing to know what's going on
[2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:46.080]  instinctively or coincidentally but this week now we have the evidence this
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:53.160]  is not this is unabashed true evidence that Tim has has come across and now
[2:48:53.160 --> 2:48:58.280]  that is proceeding with and I I want your listeners to understand that if we do
[2:48:58.280 --> 2:49:04.840]  not react to this as a community of Patriots and Constitution loving people
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:10.720]  if we do not call Tim Fox's office and Ed Corgan's office and anytime this
[2:49:10.720 --> 2:49:15.880]  comes up on your program no matter where it's located if we don't jump on this as
[2:49:15.880 --> 2:49:21.640]  like-minded brothers and sisters in the community of Patriots these people are
[2:49:21.640 --> 2:49:27.240]  going to completely roll over all of us what happens in Montana could happen in
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:31.400]  Texas could happen in Tennessee could happen in New Mexico it's it's it could
[2:49:31.400 --> 2:49:35.880]  happen anywhere to any person and interesting thing about this these
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:39.640]  these charges that Tim was telling you about what you haven't got to in the
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:43.960]  story yet that the Attorney's office at the prosecutor's office after all this
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:49.920]  evidence became publicly known to them that Tim had they dropped the charges
[2:49:49.920 --> 2:49:53.840]  against Tim's client Tim's client it trying to backtrack and
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:57.840]  retreat from what they were doing and now what I'm afraid it's going to happen
[2:49:57.840 --> 2:50:04.120]  is Tim Fox who's a Republican first-term Attorney General he campaigned on the
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:09.000]  theme of the Constitution he campaigned on the theme of getting behind the
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:12.320]  Constitution and standing for the Constitution and doing what is right
[2:50:12.320 --> 2:50:16.720]  that was his campaign theme now he's the Attorney General and he has an
[2:50:16.720 --> 2:50:21.280]  opportunity to act on the Constitution and bring justice into the state of
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:25.400]  Montana and right now it looks like he's going to sweep it under the rug and not
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:28.360]  going to do anything about it and this is the thing that just irks me to know
[2:50:28.360 --> 2:50:34.240]  when you have the evidence like you said we have them here absolutely that Tim
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:39.000]  has the evidentiary material that you have in your possession that Tim sent
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:42.800]  you and that the other attorneys have and now the county prosecutor's office
[2:50:42.800 --> 2:50:46.680]  has as well that's why they backed up that's why they dropped the charges
[2:50:46.680 --> 2:50:51.120]  against Tim's client that that's why now they're trying to do damage control
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:55.680]  etc and I got to feel what's gonna happen is the AG's office is just gonna
[2:50:55.680 --> 2:50:59.320]  simply give them a little slap on the wrist a little letter of reprimand
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:03.880]  saying don't be so naughty next time and this is all going to go away and
[2:51:03.880 --> 2:51:08.160]  nothing is going to change when clearly criminal conduct was taking place here
[2:51:08.160 --> 2:51:13.200]  I mean this is prejudicial and can you imagine that you're threatening a
[2:51:13.200 --> 2:51:19.120]  client with over 20 years in prison because I ran for president of the
[2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:23.280]  United States on a third-party ticket and because Tim the lawyer in the case
[2:51:23.280 --> 2:51:27.840]  is my son it's total authoritarian crazy town stuff we just kept this network
[2:51:27.840 --> 2:51:31.040]  break this is so important the last segment of this week's transmissions
[2:51:31.040 --> 2:51:34.840]  with Chuck Baldwin and his son I mean you guys have been effective all over the
[2:51:34.840 --> 2:51:40.160]  country waking churches up about the government control having a huge effect
[2:51:40.160 --> 2:51:43.040]  when you ran for president had a huge effect that's why you're putting those
[2:51:43.040 --> 2:51:46.280]  secret government reports that's why they demonize you that's why they
[2:51:46.280 --> 2:51:50.240]  demonize me and Ron Paul and Rand Paul but it didn't work now Ron Paul Rand
[2:51:50.240 --> 2:51:54.880]  Paul Alex Jones Chuck Baldwin all this stuff is mainstream now it's scaring
[2:51:54.880 --> 2:51:58.840]  the system mainstream publications like the Times of London say worldwide
[2:51:58.840 --> 2:52:03.800]  libertarianism is taking over leading out of the US the problem has been the US
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:07.800]  for a while because tyrant sees this the solution could come from the US we
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:13.640]  could turn this around but expanding on this if they were setting up communists
[2:52:13.640 --> 2:52:18.440]  in a town who weren't trying to hurt people but even if they were they
[2:52:18.440 --> 2:52:22.240]  deserve due process because next I'll lose my due process it's better that ten
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:27.320]  guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison so they were trying to
[2:52:27.320 --> 2:52:32.400]  set up communists like this I would criticize it and I have but this is
[2:52:32.400 --> 2:52:38.520]  constitutionalist with with the sterling records next who knows what they'll do
[2:52:38.520 --> 2:52:42.400]  they might try to set you up or claim criminal things or or plant stuff in
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:45.880]  your house I mean this is what goes on I'm not saying these guys particularly
[2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:51.000]  but but to me or some or to Ron Paul or Rand Paul there's no telling we've got
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:55.440]  to stand together when things like this happen and let the system know listen
[2:52:55.440 --> 2:52:58.840]  you're not gonna run over us because we're loyal Americans you're not gonna
[2:52:58.840 --> 2:53:03.200]  demonize us because we actually stand for having a decent country it's you
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:09.120]  people that are out of touch so out of touch that you think our Constitution is
[2:53:09.120 --> 2:53:13.280]  a dirty word Chuck Baldwin let's see what most people will realize when they
[2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:18.120]  when they think of the court system they think that both sides have justice in
[2:53:18.120 --> 2:53:23.460]  mind and that's the way it's supposed to be politics has no business in the
[2:53:23.460 --> 2:53:26.760]  justice system this is supposed to be about justice it's about the
[2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:31.040]  Constitution about the rights of man it's about innocent until proven guilty
[2:53:31.040 --> 2:53:35.840]  and what we have going on here is the politicization of our justice system
[2:53:35.840 --> 2:53:41.160]  where you have politicians who for their own parochial purposes are using the
[2:53:41.160 --> 2:53:47.200]  justice system to try and manipulate political ends within that situation
[2:53:47.200 --> 2:53:50.840]  that's called here that's called that's exactly what it's called it's
[2:53:50.840 --> 2:53:56.080]  tyranny it's it's ungodliness it is antithetical to everything that America
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:54:01.320]  was built on if we cannot have justice in our local courts think about this
[2:54:01.320 --> 2:54:05.560]  ladies and gentlemen if we cannot have it justice if you cannot walk into a
[2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:10.800]  courtroom knowing that there's going to be justice as the motivation in any
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:16.240]  case if it's all about politics if it's about agendas if it's about careers and
[2:54:16.240 --> 2:54:21.080]  and all these things then we have lost our country we're not America anymore
[2:54:21.080 --> 2:54:25.000]  we're not free anymore we're not a republic anymore everything that our
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:30.200]  founding fathers fought and died for is kaput this kind of thing is what is I
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:37.240]  think the that the that it's the tip of the iceberg but it reveals the depth of
[2:54:37.240 --> 2:54:41.400]  of the situation that we that's right if they sweep it out of the rug it means
[2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:45.280]  it's going on in every county and it's a green light to do more of it and it but
[2:54:45.280 --> 2:54:49.080]  if somebody gets in trouble for this it's a red light to all the people that
[2:54:49.080 --> 2:54:53.640]  want to use the court system as their own personal cash register or political
[2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:57.720]  weapon to beat people over the head and bankrupt people they don't like because
[2:54:57.720 --> 2:55:00.880]  they dare promote the Constitution since I mentioned it I want to put the
[2:55:00.880 --> 2:55:07.840]  article out of Massachusetts up on screen mass school board rejects then
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:12.360]  accepts Constitution booklets former resident offered two thousand eight
[2:55:12.360 --> 2:55:17.200]  hundred copies that's in the Eagle Tribune and they were going to give them
[2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:20.640]  the little pocket constitutions you know that they give out when you visit
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:25.120]  Congress and stuff and they said oh no this is the this is politically
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:29.760]  incorrect we can't accept something this evil I mean how have they gotten it to
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:34.360]  the point where a pocket Constitution in my film road to tyranny squad car
[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:39.400]  video of Abby Newman no criminal record naval veteran buying canning supplies in
[2:55:39.400 --> 2:55:42.840]  town they get in her trunk at a checkpoint they won't let her search it
[2:55:42.840 --> 2:55:50.760]  broad daylight so they open up the trunk there's a Patriots game VHS with
[2:55:50.760 --> 2:55:54.680]  Harrison Ford there's my film police state and there's a pocket Constitution
[2:55:54.680 --> 2:55:58.400]  and the state police start hyperventilating like they found a dead
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:03.600]  baby or something what type of mind control is this where if they see a
[2:56:03.600 --> 2:56:07.160]  corrupt government abortions they see something good but they see a pocket
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:11.880]  Constitution they start hyperventilating that's like absurdist Kurt Vonnegut
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:16.840]  stuff I'm in the that's like satire Chuck well yeah and a place running the
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:20.400]  case we're talking about now think about this think about this the reason that
[2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:25.200]  the county attorney and and his subordinates were so upset with Tim
[2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:29.440]  being the lawyer in this case think about it here was here's what got him
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:34.520]  upset I his dad Chuck Baldwin ran for president of the United States on a
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:39.720]  third-party ticket in 2008 that's number one number two we Tim and I both are
[2:56:39.720 --> 2:56:46.280]  constitutionalist that was it that what that those two things created the bias
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:50.440]  which created the intimidation and the threats well it's like vampires are
[2:56:50.440 --> 2:56:54.440]  scared crosses it's a good I mean for us that's ridiculous why would you be
[2:56:54.440 --> 2:57:01.520]  against the Constitution to them it's really scary yeah I mean when when you
[2:57:01.520 --> 2:57:05.560]  get to a point that you are willing to put people in jail because of the
[2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:11.800]  political opinions of the attorney that is representing the case in court that's
[2:57:11.800 --> 2:57:17.400]  that is no different the North Korea what the Nazis did in the 1920s and 30s
[2:57:17.400 --> 2:57:22.400]  and what the communists did under under Stalin there's no different exactly and
[2:57:22.400 --> 2:57:25.320]  I guarantee you a lot of our listeners who are great people are so conditioned
[2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:28.800]  by evil that this isn't even a big deal to them anymore I catch myself all the
[2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:32.880]  time seeing something horrible and it's just so par for the course how do you
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:35.280]  spiritually check I want to go to Brent come back and overdrive and get
[2:57:35.280 --> 2:57:38.160]  final comment from you and your son and give out the websites people can see
[2:57:38.160 --> 2:57:42.680]  more of this but but how do how do we all get to the point immersed in evil
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:48.360]  where even if we don't like it we become comfortable with it well Edmund
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:52.200]  Burke said all that's necessary for evil a trap is for good men to do nothing and
[2:57:52.200 --> 2:57:56.720]  if we want evil to triumph we do nothing I think most of your audience are
[2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:00.360]  activists that I don't know I know they are I'm just saying some people out there
[2:58:00.360 --> 2:58:03.640]  even myself sometimes I just get used to it you know it's just there's just so
[2:58:03.640 --> 2:58:08.760]  much of it well I don't want to ever get used to it if I don't want to get used
[2:58:08.760 --> 2:58:12.560]  to it I'm gonna I totally agree with you this stuff no I totally agree with you
[2:58:12.560 --> 2:58:16.040]  what do you pray to God to like keep you angry about I mean I'm very angry I'm
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:21.520]  but I'm saying the stuff happening now I would have gone crazy ten years ago how

[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:36.520]  number to the attorney general and to this prosecutor folks want to call them
[3:00:36.520 --> 3:00:40.920]  attorney general and say investigate this more don't just reprimand it because
[3:00:40.920 --> 3:00:45.960]  don't just have a verbal reprimand you can see on the tape you can you you can
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:53.040]  hear what happened and it just shows how out of touch these people are that they
[3:00:53.040 --> 3:00:57.440]  would want to violate somebody's rights kick a lawyer off black ball somebody
[3:00:57.440 --> 3:01:01.480]  from working just because they feel like it it shows an enormous entitlement and
[3:01:01.480 --> 3:01:06.520]  baby-ness and when I was trying to articulate earlier that how do you stay
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:10.000]  outraged I stay too outraged I think about this stuff all the time I work all
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:14.320]  the time everybody knows that but still I catch myself sometimes seeing
[3:01:14.320 --> 3:01:17.560]  something outrageous and not getting upset by it and I realize the general
[3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:21.320]  public's like that all the time I know our audience is super awake I'm saying
[3:01:21.320 --> 3:01:24.400]  out of the general public out there listening though there are people going
[3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:27.360]  all what's the big deal that stuff goes on everywhere if you've gotten to that
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:31.280]  point that's why our country's dying final comment for two minutes Chuck Baldwin
[3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:36.320]  and then Tim Baldwin about where this is going yeah and I think that once we
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:40.920]  realize that we can make a difference I think that will impact the way that we
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:44.760]  act I think what a lot of people have the attitude unfortunately is that it's
[3:01:44.760 --> 3:01:49.240]  hopeless and there's nothing they can do and they don't realize the power that
[3:01:49.240 --> 3:01:54.200]  they have as the citizenry of this country I mean we need whenever we find
[3:01:54.200 --> 3:01:58.880]  an injustice and we know what's going on we need to do everything we can we may
[3:01:58.880 --> 3:02:02.480]  not can do everything Alex but we can do it we can't the globalist are going to
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:05.440]  tell us about all the victories we're having they're happening all over the

[3:02:09.760 --> 3:02:13.960]  and you know I'm involved as you are and we're doing a weekend but everybody out

[3:02:44.040 --> 3:02:48.280]  put somebody in jail for over 20 years of his life to just to get back at a
[3:02:48.280 --> 3:02:51.840]  lawyer who because they don't like him because he's the cost you know these

[3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:27.320]  with the same prosecutor that we're talking about here at Corrigan they've
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:30.520]  had the same battles I respect them greatly and that's the reason why we
[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:34.560]  actually joined up was because we have a similar philosophy of protecting our
[3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:37.800]  client's rights and it brought us together but they're not the only one
[3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:41.920]  there are attorneys throughout this county that have told me personally they
[3:04:41.920 --> 3:04:45.640]  know what I'm doing is right they've experienced things like this before for
[3:04:45.640 --> 3:04:48.760]  some reason they may not may not have had the opportunities well had not
[3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:53.480]  spoken out as much as I have or I hear you we're out of time people just got to
[3:04:53.480 --> 3:04:56.600]  have the will to fight and take action and these little battles of the big
[3:04:56.600 --> 3:05:22.200]  battle God bless you all see you back Sunday
