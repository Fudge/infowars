[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:21.800]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas welcome to the Alex Jones show
[00:21.800 --> 00:28.360]  I'm David Knight on this Friday April 4th 2014 and we're gonna be covering a lot of news now
[00:28.360 --> 00:33.640]  of course Captain America previewed last night and I'm probably about the only person here
[00:33.640 --> 00:38.800]  at Infowars that didn't see it it's a tough job but somebody's got to go see the movies and
[00:38.800 --> 00:44.040]  we've got some reports on that from Jakari Jackson and Leanne McAdoo we promise we're not gonna
[00:44.040 --> 00:49.840]  have any spoilers in there we've also got a couple of special reports from Alex Jones instructions
[00:49.840 --> 00:54.960]  on from the government actually on how to deal with tyranny also another special report on
[00:54.960 --> 01:02.560]  climate change and we've got a lot of breaking news one of the top stories on Infowars it just
[01:02.560 --> 01:07.720]  came out this morning was on the constitutional convention and the specter that we could have
[01:07.720 --> 01:14.000]  a new constitutional convention to go back and revisit everything essentially is that the problem
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.960]  is that a solution is that a solution is the Constitution the problem or is it maybe the
[01:18.960 --> 01:26.400]  people who are in government that's the problem and what happens if we replace the Constitution we
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.440]  take out the law that is really very good and we replace it with something else that essentially
[01:32.440 --> 01:38.040]  gives them cover for their illegal activities can we trust the people in charge now to run
[01:38.040 --> 01:44.160]  a constitutional convention if we make it better if we make it more explicit if we take out some
[01:44.160 --> 01:49.400]  of the wiggle room that they've inserted because there really isn't wiggle room it's really their
[01:49.400 --> 01:54.000]  interpretations of it it's really pretty clear is it going to get worse well we're gonna talk
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.760]  about that we're also going to talk about of course the Fort Hood shooting there's a story
[01:57.760 --> 02:02.640]  up on drudge report about the common connection with this shooting and with other shootings and
[02:02.640 --> 02:10.320]  that is SSRI drugs not PTSD but the government has a long history of how they deal with veterans
[02:10.320 --> 02:17.360]  with PTSD we're gonna look at the past the present and the future and it involves people like DARPA
[02:17.360 --> 02:21.920]  and we can also take a look at what's going on with this EPA human testing story which we broke
[02:21.920 --> 02:29.040]  here on info wars the lawsuit was started back in September 2012 Mike Steve Malloy with junk
[02:29.040 --> 02:35.640]  science.com had started his investigations of what was going on in North Carolina and he had
[02:35.640 --> 02:42.040]  already broken that I guess a couple of weeks before the lawsuit was filed but that was that was
[02:42.040 --> 02:47.000]  broken on info wars about a year and a half ago and of course it went to trial they tried to get
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.640]  a temporary restraining order so we're gonna have an update on that we also have updates on a lot
[02:52.640 --> 03:00.840]  of police brutality it's just amazing how every day we're seeing more and more reports of police
[03:00.840 --> 03:07.480]  not even pretending to follow any reasonable procedures just coming in as thugs attacking
[03:07.480 --> 03:13.080]  people invading their homes pointing guns at children locking down schools because they
[03:13.080 --> 03:18.040]  see a tripod and we're gonna talk about the logical conclusion of that and maybe one of
[03:18.040 --> 03:22.120]  the driving forces there's a lot of things driving it it's being driven from the federal
[03:22.120 --> 03:27.240]  government that's why it's happening all over America it's the way the police are being trained
[03:27.240 --> 03:33.480]  they're being conditioned that they are no longer under any restraints and of course no
[03:33.480 --> 03:39.280]  matter what they do nothing ever happens to them we're gonna be talking about another aspect of
[03:39.280 --> 03:45.880]  that not just the push from Homeland Security we're gonna be talking about the pull from private
[03:45.880 --> 03:51.400]  prisons we're gonna be talking about a scandal that just broke in Arizona about private prisons
[03:51.400 --> 03:57.800]  we also have some economic news we have some civil liberties economic news Venezuela is
[03:57.800 --> 04:04.200]  enforcing fingerprint registries in order to buy groceries that sounds pretty crazy doesn't it could
[04:04.200 --> 04:09.400]  that happen here is it maybe already happening here to some degree when you go to the grocery store
[04:09.400 --> 04:15.480]  and they you sign up for a discount with your card are they creating a paper trail that the
[04:15.480 --> 04:19.960]  government can then use because we've had some executive orders that come down that line so
[04:19.960 --> 04:25.160]  we're gonna be talking about that another topic we're going to cover today is Judge Napolitano
[04:25.160 --> 04:33.080]  he says we need to jail James Clapper yes absolutely and Judge Napolitano makes a very good case
[04:33.080 --> 04:39.080]  for that based on what James Clapper has just said there are a lot of people a lot of people in
[04:39.080 --> 04:45.720]  Washington that need to go to jail that's why i'm concerned about the constitutional convention
[04:45.720 --> 04:50.200]  because if we're not willing to stand for the laws that we have now that are being broken
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.400]  what good does it do even if we get a stronger more strongly worded constitutional we'll be right
[04:55.400 --> 05:04.200]  back stay tuned a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine west virginia counties
[05:04.200 --> 05:08.440]  this year alone over 300 000 people in west virginia had their drinking water contaminated
[05:08.440 --> 05:13.320]  what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water it's forced medical treatment
[05:13.320 --> 05:18.120]  without the consent of residents my friends water filtration is one of the most basic actions you

[05:22.600 --> 05:27.480]  on average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week few filters cut
[05:27.480 --> 05:32.600]  out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide removed pesticides herbicides

[08:19.160 --> 08:24.920]  three shots were fired at president kennedy's motorcade in downtown dallas the first report
[08:24.920 --> 08:32.920]  to say that president kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new
[08:37.160 --> 08:41.800]  it was almost as if it were a planned implosion it just banked
[08:41.800 --> 08:48.040]  it either you were with us or you were with the terrorists
[09:01.080 --> 09:06.040]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not
[09:06.040 --> 09:14.920]  the hands of criminals guns will be taken no one will be able to be off we can take all justice
[09:14.920 --> 09:19.720]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an american city

[09:56.920 --> 10:02.280]  you've already seen it you can get our take on it our liberty take on that film but that has
[10:02.280 --> 10:06.200]  some spoilers in it we're not going to have spoilers because i haven't seen it and i don't
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.160]  want to know what's in it before i see it and you don't either if you haven't seen it yet but we're
[10:11.160 --> 10:15.800]  going to have a review about that alex is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour with
[10:15.800 --> 10:19.560]  a special report he's also going to have one later in the show on climate change the one at the
[10:19.560 --> 10:24.120]  bottom of the hour is really going to be on how do you deal with tyranny you know we actually
[10:24.120 --> 10:30.920]  have some instructions from the government on how to do that and we're also going to have a lot of
[10:30.920 --> 10:36.440]  breaking news about constitutional convention what's going on with the fort hood shooting and
[10:36.440 --> 10:43.240]  something that is even bigger than that and that is what is the reaction to the shooting how are
[10:43.240 --> 10:49.720]  people coming after guns how are they coming after the soldiers we see a lot of conservatives who
[10:49.720 --> 10:56.840]  are throwing people under the bus that they say have ptsd but of course as the article that's up on
[10:56.840 --> 11:04.280]  drudge our article from paul joseph watson and alex shown yesterday made it very clear that the
[11:04.280 --> 11:11.800]  connecting factor with all of these mass shootings are ssri drugs kit daniels and jacari jackson went
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.480]  to the press conference at fort hood and they asked the question that everybody wanted to know
[11:17.480 --> 11:22.440]  was he on ssris because that is the common thread that we have seen with all these shootings and
[11:22.440 --> 11:28.840]  the answer was clearly yes and so that's part of the problem taking guns away from soldiers
[11:29.400 --> 11:34.600]  who are entrusted as we saw pictures on the daily mail we saw pictures of this soldier who did the
[11:34.600 --> 11:41.320]  shooting we saw him carrying all kinds of guns large caliber guns rocket launchers if you're
[11:41.320 --> 11:49.320]  going to say that the military can't be trusted with firearms with sidearms when you're giving them
[11:49.320 --> 11:55.640]  the state-of-the-art heaviest equipment not even just firearms but you're putting them in tanks
[11:55.640 --> 12:00.840]  you're giving them missiles whatever if you can't trust people with those weapons how you
[12:00.840 --> 12:05.720]  with a sidearm how can you trust them with those weapons it's very much like the tsa
[12:05.720 --> 12:12.680]  hassling airline pilots over nail clippers isn't it you're putting the airline pilots
[12:12.680 --> 12:17.000]  they're in the driver's seat of the airplane they can turn that into a missile if they want to the
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.920]  same thing with the military if they can't be trusted to protect themselves they can't be
[12:22.920 --> 12:28.120]  trusted to protect us either can they but we're going to be talking about something that's even
[12:28.120 --> 12:34.680]  beyond that and that is what is the government's history with ptsd and what are they planning
[12:34.680 --> 12:40.520]  to do in the future about it and darpa is involved in that they have a very very shameful history of
[12:40.520 --> 12:44.840]  the way they have treated going back to world war two there was a wonderful expose and the
[12:44.840 --> 12:50.120]  wall street journal we're going to be talking about that but before we start this i want to
[12:50.120 --> 12:55.240]  talk about the constitutional convention this just came up on info wars this morning an article
[12:55.240 --> 13:00.760]  from paul joseph watson could the u.s constitution be changed to eliminate the second amendment
[13:00.760 --> 13:06.600]  he points out the entire u.s constitution could be up for review after michigan became the 34th
[13:06.600 --> 13:10.760]  state to vote in favor of a constitutional convention article five of the u.s constitution
[13:10.760 --> 13:16.040]  states that congress quote shall call a convention for proposing amendments unquote should the two
[13:16.040 --> 13:21.560]  thirds requirement be met and it was last week when michigan lawmakers endorsed the move now
[13:22.360 --> 13:28.360]  representative duncan hunter from california wants this to start and we've already seen a lot of
[13:28.360 --> 13:33.640]  people pushing back former supreme court justice john paul stevens said he thinks that the second
[13:33.640 --> 13:38.440]  amendment has to go of course uh sodas pierce morgan but actually he went and said the kind of
[13:38.440 --> 13:44.120]  sense said of the second amendment but uh justice stevens says that he thinks that we could improve
[13:44.120 --> 13:49.800]  the constitution by changing the right to keep him bare arms and making it only apply to those in
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.880]  the quote unquote militia and not the general public at large well when he says that that means
[13:53.880 --> 14:01.560]  that he doesn't really understand what the militia is the militia is not the army that was made very
[14:01.560 --> 14:08.200]  clear from anybody who knows anything about the historical writings and the tension going back
[14:08.200 --> 14:11.880]  and forth between the militia and the regular army at the time of the revolutionary war there
[14:11.880 --> 14:17.400]  was a very clear understanding that the militia was the armed citizenry and it was very clear in
[14:17.400 --> 14:22.440]  the constitution that the militia was there to put down rebellions to defend us against foreign
[14:22.440 --> 14:27.960]  invasions and it was very clear in the constitution that the military was not supposed to be a permanent
[14:28.920 --> 14:32.680]  organization they were not to be a standing army they were very concerned about a standing army
[14:32.680 --> 14:39.480]  we've had a standing army now for 60 years and they warned that the means of our defense abroad
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.880]  would become the instruments of tyranny at home and that's what we're very concerned about when
[14:43.880 --> 14:49.000]  we look at homeland security when we look at the federal government militarizing the police
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.960]  and using the police as military we see the confluence of that in the ndaa act the section
[14:55.960 --> 15:02.200]  that obama signed that said that the military could arrest people in the united states american
[15:02.200 --> 15:08.600]  citizens in the united states hold them indefinitely without trial transport them with extraordinary
[15:08.600 --> 15:13.560]  rendition to other places where they could presumably be tortured as we now learn in the
[15:13.560 --> 15:17.800]  documents that the senate intelligence committee has put out we learned that yes that has been
[15:17.800 --> 15:24.120]  going on for quite some time and yes the intelligence that they got from that was not effective it was
[15:24.120 --> 15:29.400]  things that they already knew it was garbage intelligence they were simply torturing people
[15:29.400 --> 15:35.320]  criminal acts torturing people well the concern that i have and we should all think about this
[15:35.320 --> 15:42.120]  for the constitutional convention is if we have people who don't obey the law will they obey the
[15:42.120 --> 15:47.320]  law if it's more strongly more clearly worded because that's what we're looking at now the other
[15:47.320 --> 15:53.720]  jeopardy jeopardy of course is that the government is always trying to make legal the illegal things
[15:53.720 --> 15:58.840]  that they're doing just the fact that they have prohibitions against so much of what they're doing
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.920]  doesn't stop them from spying on all of us with dragnet spying with the nsa but they're constantly
[16:04.920 --> 16:11.800]  trying to use people like mike rogers and others to justify it to say to make a legal case for the
[16:11.800 --> 16:17.640]  criminal actions that they're engaged in and that's what could come out of a constitutional convention
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.080]  on the other hand the best case scenario is let's say that we get something that is extremely
[16:23.080 --> 16:28.840]  well worded and clear about dragnet spying with the nsa that's clear about the second
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.000]  amendment being a right of the people i don't know how you make that any more clear when we
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.840]  say it's a right of the people it's not of the government it's not of the government's military
[16:38.840 --> 16:43.880]  it's of the people that's why it's talking about a militia but it is an individual right the supreme
[16:43.880 --> 16:48.520]  court has said it's an individual right so now maybe they need a constitutional convention to try
[16:48.520 --> 16:55.160]  to rewrite that the problem is is that our rights transcend the constitution they don't derive from
[16:55.160 --> 17:01.160]  it the constitution recognizes fundamental rights that we all possess as individuals rights that are
[17:01.160 --> 17:07.240]  inalienable to us as individuals and when we allow the government to trample on those rights
[17:07.240 --> 17:13.640]  that's a very serious thing the constitution was set there to make it very clear to respect those
[17:13.640 --> 17:20.440]  rights so what do we do when the government totally ignores it and is it going to make them
[17:20.440 --> 17:24.680]  respond to it if we make it even more clear of course it won't take a look at some of these police
[17:24.680 --> 17:30.840]  brutality cases that have just surfaced within the last 24 hours it's absolutely amazing we've
[17:30.840 --> 17:36.120]  got a video here of a man this is a guy 26 years old he's in Louisiana neighbors call the police
[17:36.120 --> 17:40.680]  and the cop comes in and this is a very long video we're not going to have time to play all of it
[17:41.400 --> 17:47.160]  to give you an idea what's happening the guy comes in the cop just barges his way in and the guy's

[24:18.760 --> 24:23.800]  as we can see these continuing police state episodes as i mentioned just before the break
[24:23.800 --> 24:29.240]  when we're talking about a constitutional convention and we're trying to clarify things
[24:29.240 --> 24:32.920]  which many of us would like to see things clarified stronger language put in there
[24:33.480 --> 24:38.360]  that may not happen we may lose the language that we've got in there they may make a case for
[24:38.360 --> 24:43.160]  themselves cut themselves free from the chains that they have in the constitution right now
[24:43.800 --> 24:49.960]  but they've already cut themselves loose from the chain they already ignore clear prohibitions
[24:49.960 --> 24:55.240]  and as i said just before the break where the rubber meets the roads is the cops in our neighborhoods
[24:55.240 --> 25:02.760]  and in our homes we just played a clip from a guy who was uh 26 years old in louisiana and we got a
[25:02.760 --> 25:08.680]  cop who comes in pushes his way inside the home no explanation the guy wants to know his name
[25:08.680 --> 25:13.240]  wants to know what he's doing there why are you arresting me the cop says i'm not answering you
[25:13.240 --> 25:21.240]  you answer to me no you answer to the constitution you swore an oath to or you don't have any legitimate
[25:21.240 --> 25:26.440]  authority and we don't want to see that constitution changed why was he put under arrest
[25:27.160 --> 25:33.000]  because he was resisting arrest does that sound like something out of a franz kafka novel it is
[25:33.560 --> 25:41.000]  it's franz kafka with a norwellian boot stomping on the face of the public now it's not just that
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.440]  we've got in the last 24 hours we've got another one look at this cop pulls gun on fifth graders
[25:46.440 --> 25:52.120]  building a tree for it this is also an info wars dot com michael phalan police in georgia forced a
[25:52.120 --> 25:56.040]  group of fifth graders to the ground at gunpoint this week as they attempted to build a tree fort
[25:56.040 --> 26:01.240]  in their own neighborhood according to 911 records the police were called after a neighbor a snitch
[26:01.240 --> 26:06.920]  neighbor noticed the children quote chopping off tree limbs and an activity that she said was
[26:06.920 --> 26:13.240]  hurting the environment and creating tripping hazards so that clearly justifies the cops showing
[26:13.240 --> 26:18.920]  up and pointing guns at the fifth graders let's uh take a let's take a look at that clip that we've
[26:18.920 --> 26:24.840]  got here 11 year old son omari a star student had a terrifying run in with henry county police
[26:24.840 --> 26:30.040]  well he was crying the drama started while omari and a few buddies all around the same age built a
[26:30.040 --> 26:34.760]  fort in the trees after school last week baptize says when two officers rolled up one of them had
[26:34.760 --> 26:39.560]  his gun drawn all he could get out at the time was mom he had a gun in my face he had a gun in my
[26:39.560 --> 26:44.040]  face 911 records show a neighbor in the next subdivision had called in to complain the kids
[26:44.040 --> 26:49.000]  were chopping off tree limbs still as long until i got him to calm down then he told me you know
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.000]  how he had them on the ground and they had to spread their legs i said they were rubbing a store
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.960]  she says the officers also used foul language to the boys and when he took omari home he just came
[26:59.960 --> 27:06.040]  with such an attitude his old physical appearance was one of you know i'm still big and bad no rest
[27:06.040 --> 27:10.440]  but baptize filed an excessive force complaint with the department you can understand of course
[27:10.440 --> 27:15.480]  you know why these parents all right let's stop it right there i think it's time that we all file
[27:15.480 --> 27:21.480]  an excessive complaint force with the police before they do that to our kids before they do it to us
[27:21.480 --> 27:27.320]  we see this excessive force being used everywhere and the police coming back and saying i was afraid
[27:27.320 --> 27:33.880]  or they were resisting me whatever they want to use but it is also the panic of the public
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.520]  and a lot of that is being driven by the mainstream news media by the federal government look at this
[27:38.520 --> 27:47.400]  case out of maryland this is in baltimore police go to an academy and they lock it down because a
[27:47.400 --> 27:53.400]  journalism student's tripod is mistaken for a weapon same kind of panic that they just did with this
[27:53.400 --> 28:00.920]  tree fort thing but you know i'm reminded remember pastor martin emuler's famous quote about the
[28:00.920 --> 28:05.000]  nazis and he said they came for the jews they came for this group and i didn't do anything
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.440]  because i wasn't part of that group i wasn't part of the next group i wasn't part of the group after
[28:08.440 --> 28:15.160]  that and eventually they came for me and there was nobody left to help me now you may think that
[28:15.160 --> 28:21.080]  this isn't going to affect you because maybe you don't climb trees or whatever you're not a kid
[28:21.080 --> 28:27.560]  climbing trees anymore there are middle-aged adults 70-year-olds who are filing complaints all over
[28:27.560 --> 28:32.680]  the place now because they're driving in other states with colorado license plates and they're
[28:32.680 --> 28:39.080]  getting pulled and given the full drug inspection treatment just because they've got colorado
[28:39.080 --> 28:45.080]  license plates that's the paranoia that's the insanity of the police but there's a reason for
[28:45.080 --> 28:50.760]  that it's not just being pushed from washington from homeland security it's also being pulled
[28:50.760 --> 28:55.800]  by the private prison system and there's some breaking news out of that that we're going to
[28:55.800 --> 29:01.400]  have later in the show out of arizona give you an example of what's going on with private prisons
[29:01.400 --> 29:07.880]  this is something that started in the 80s it is a bipartisan problem obama could stop it with his
[29:07.880 --> 29:14.280]  pen and his phone if he wanted to but he has connections to these corporates as well they
[29:14.280 --> 29:19.720]  started under the reagan administration with zero tolerance and mandatory minimum drug sentencing
[29:19.720 --> 29:25.560]  but it is something that could be stopped now what do we do about this kind of tyranny well alex
[29:25.560 --> 29:31.000]  jones has a report right after the break the government actually tells us what to do when
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.040]  we encounter predators and tyranny is just predation so we're going to have that report
[29:36.040 --> 29:51.880]  right after the break from alex jones stay tuned we'll be right back we're on the march the empires

[33:17.640 --> 33:26.520]  his horse he's going the distance crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[33:29.800 --> 33:34.040]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and i've got a report from alex we're
[33:34.040 --> 33:39.160]  going to play in just a second it's actually how the government tells us to deal with predators
[33:39.160 --> 33:43.320]  is really the same way we need to deal with tyrants and as we were just covering in the last few
[33:43.320 --> 33:48.360]  segments people are calling for a constitutional convention many people believe that with clear
[33:48.360 --> 33:53.080]  language maybe the criminals in washington would obey the people but hey you know what
[33:53.640 --> 33:59.480]  lois larner and the current irs commissioner don't care about congress they don't care about
[34:00.120 --> 34:06.360]  the sorts of orders for an investigation that when congress did that to nixon they impeached him and
[34:06.360 --> 34:10.440]  of course one of the other articles of impeachment with nixon was that he used the irs against
[34:10.440 --> 34:16.520]  political enemies so there's two of the three right there just in that one scandal of course when
[34:17.080 --> 34:23.400]  nixon asked the irs to do it the commissioner saved the papers that he didn't do it but now we
[34:23.400 --> 34:29.720]  have the irs actively and openly doing this because the irs let's let's understand the irs has been
[34:29.720 --> 34:35.480]  used by republicans and democrats to punish their political enemies for a very long time
[34:35.480 --> 34:41.400]  that explains really in my opinion why the republicans are not doing anything they're like a bad
[34:41.400 --> 34:47.400]  parent saying i really mean it this time if you don't give me those emails from 2010 in january
[34:47.400 --> 34:52.200]  i'm i'm going to i'm going to do something about it i'm i'm going to say that you're in contempt
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.880]  i mean come on and then they don't do it if you're a parent and you tell your kids all right i'm
[34:57.880 --> 35:02.120]  going to count to ten and you better do what i say at that point in time you know what they're
[35:02.120 --> 35:06.760]  they're not and then you don't do it even then they're not going to pay any attention to you
[35:07.800 --> 35:11.800]  giving them ultimatums like that especially ultimatums that you don't enforce is the way
[35:11.800 --> 35:18.360]  to be a very very weak and effective parent or a weak and effective legislature because they
[35:18.360 --> 35:24.120]  don't care but they think that they're going to have the reins of power again and they're going
[35:24.120 --> 35:28.680]  to use the irs to punish their political enemies that's why they're not doing anything about it
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.480]  except trying to make some score some cheap political points but the danger about all this
[35:34.120 --> 35:39.640]  is that when they do it in in the open when they pull this out and they show it to everybody and
[35:39.640 --> 35:45.800]  they show they pull back the veil and they show all the corruption behind the curtain and then
[35:45.800 --> 35:53.400]  they do nothing about it they have taken us to an all new low level that's the real danger of an
[35:53.400 --> 35:58.040]  ineffective and corrupt government and so we were talking about where does that meet the road well
[35:58.040 --> 36:03.480]  it meets the road at the point where the police start invading our homes like the videos that
[36:03.480 --> 36:06.840]  we were just showing before this where they start pointing guns at our children where they start
[36:06.840 --> 36:13.480]  pulling over senior citizens and giving them a drug treatment you know looking for drugs in their
[36:13.480 --> 36:20.120]  car pulling over three or four patrol cars showing up rousing the guy out of his car putting drug
[36:20.120 --> 36:25.720]  dogs in his car simply because he's got a Colorado license plate and he's in a neighboring state
[36:25.720 --> 36:32.360]  really is that the kind of society that you want to live in maybe you don't have a Colorado license
[36:32.360 --> 36:38.120]  plate but you know what you're living under the government that is encouraging our citizens to
[36:38.120 --> 36:43.160]  be treated as suspects remember this is the same government that put out those uh no hesitation
[36:43.160 --> 36:49.240]  targets and they had children as well as pregnant women as well as elderly that's what we're seeing
[36:49.240 --> 36:56.440]  in these cases so what do we do about these kinds of predators alex jones has an idea
[37:03.480 --> 37:08.440]  we're here at big bend national park and everywhere we see lessons
[37:10.200 --> 37:16.040]  that are applicable in mother nature but also in human interactions with bullies
[37:16.040 --> 37:22.040]  and when i'm talking about bullies i'm talking about government itself historically the biggest
[37:22.040 --> 37:26.120]  bully and the largest danger to human populations of course the university of
[37:26.680 --> 37:31.240]  Hawaii did a big study about it a decade or so ago finding that government conservatively killed
[37:31.240 --> 37:37.480]  in non-military related deaths two hundred and sixty two million people in the 20th century
[37:37.480 --> 37:43.400]  and government is already online in the 21st century to break that record now what does
[37:43.400 --> 37:50.840]  that do with big bend i'll tell you right now look at this lion warning a lion has been
[37:50.840 --> 37:56.040]  frequenting this area and could be aggressive towards humans if you see a lion pick up small
[37:56.040 --> 38:01.640]  children stand together appear large wave arms shout aggressively throw stones or sticks report
[38:01.640 --> 38:10.520]  sightings to a ranger do not show fear crouch down run away so there you go ladies and gentlemen
[38:10.520 --> 38:18.760]  when humans act aggressive and and defend their private property and are armed predators whether
[38:18.760 --> 38:23.480]  they're bullies or mountain lions whatever the case is don't come after you when you grovel like to
[38:23.480 --> 38:29.480]  the tsa and bow down and someone in a uniform becomes god that's the essence of north korea the
[38:29.480 --> 38:36.120]  essence of mexico the essence of tyranny a tsa agent was arrested on january 3rd and was behaving
[38:36.120 --> 38:47.720]  erotically saying i am god i'm in charge and so the answer is to be basically a noble savage who's
[38:47.720 --> 38:52.920]  into science and technology and is informed but at the same time retains your human instinct
[38:52.920 --> 38:58.120]  to not be a prey animal but to quite frankly be a predator that's what's happening is subgroups
[38:58.120 --> 39:02.680]  of humans in government are engaged in predator activity on us that's called tyranny we're supposed
[39:02.680 --> 39:09.160]  to form family units cultural units that defend each other and build a better civilization based on
[39:09.720 --> 39:17.720]  renaissance art literature not based on the rule of the fog so next time tyrants are in your face
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.760]  don't show fear don't crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you don't bow down don't run away
[39:22.760 --> 39:26.920]  stand up stand together as communities that's why they're destroying families while they're playing
[39:26.920 --> 39:34.120]  men and women off against each other that is the plan so come together folks unity unity for the
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.360]  basic bill of rights and constitution alex jones signing off for info wars dot com we're going
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.000]  to go back to report from a year ago that david night filed similar to this one pointing out the
[39:43.000 --> 39:55.560]  correlation to bears and how you should behave around them i'm david night reporting from
[39:55.560 --> 40:00.840]  info wars nightly news just before i left for austin i took my family to the smoky mountains
[40:00.840 --> 40:05.080]  now long before the europeans named it the smoky mountains the chair key had a name for it and i
[40:05.080 --> 40:10.600]  if i pronounce it correctly it's something like shakona quay which means place of the fine
[40:10.600 --> 40:16.280]  particulate smog no not actually that's what the epa wants you to think i was surprised to see this
[40:16.280 --> 40:23.320]  graphic on the epa site where they explain what pm 2.5 is they use the smoky mountains as a poster
[40:23.320 --> 40:30.920]  child is it really pm 2.5 and man made smog that makes the smoky mountains smoky no we all know
[40:30.920 --> 40:35.720]  that it isn't but we see this kind of thing done over and over again like they did with polar bears
[40:35.720 --> 40:40.760]  on ice flows remember that and of course al gore is telling us that the oceans are rising but he
[40:40.760 --> 40:46.760]  builds his nine million dollar mansion in montecito california right on the ocean side so i don't
[40:46.760 --> 40:53.240]  think he believes that either but they use these subliminal messages to try to convince us and
[40:53.240 --> 40:57.560]  that could be quite effective and speaking of bears every visitor to the smoky mountains gets a
[40:57.560 --> 41:03.240]  handout that looks like this warning you about black bears as my wife was reading that to the
[41:03.240 --> 41:07.800]  small children i started thinking a lot of the stuff they were saying about bears could be said
[41:07.800 --> 41:13.720]  about government especially about the epa let me just read a few things here uh with aggressive
[41:13.720 --> 41:20.200]  behavior the bear the epa is demanding more space if the bear or epa continues to follow you stand
[41:20.200 --> 41:26.280]  your ground if the epa gets closer talk louder or shout at it act aggressively act together as a group
[41:26.280 --> 41:31.800]  if you have companions make yourself look as large as possible don't run don't turn away
[41:32.520 --> 41:36.200]  and don't feed the epa it only encourages further problems
[41:37.080 --> 41:43.640]  david night friend for wars nightly news first report that i did when i came here and of course
[41:43.640 --> 41:49.640]  the thing that was breaking at that point in time alex had already talked to someone a year and a
[41:49.640 --> 41:55.240]  half ago just before i got here about the epa's human testing program that was going on right
[41:55.240 --> 42:01.320]  there in north carolina trying to make a case for fine particulate matter you know a year earlier
[42:01.320 --> 42:07.480]  lisa jackson had said that as many people died from fine particulate matter that would be things
[42:07.480 --> 42:14.120]  like wood smoke okay as people who were dying from cancer it was a set up press conference
[42:14.120 --> 42:18.760]  with her and representative markey he was feeding her questions and they wanted to emphasize that
[42:18.760 --> 42:23.160]  that was a narrative that they wanted to come out of that was that it was so dangerous that they
[42:23.160 --> 42:28.040]  had as many people dying from that as they did from cancer that was in september of 2011
[42:28.680 --> 42:33.960]  and she made it very clear she said i'm not talking about people getting sick i'm talking about it
[42:33.960 --> 42:39.320]  talking about it actually killing you now at the time she was doing that dog and pony show
[42:39.880 --> 42:46.920]  at the congressional committee they also had the epa in north carolina hooking people up directly
[42:47.480 --> 42:53.720]  to diesel fumes diesel exhaust coming out of a truck running it through a pipe onto a mask on
[42:53.720 --> 43:00.200]  their face in a small room and that was what they were doing at the time trying to make a case to
[43:00.200 --> 43:07.720]  increase the regulations against fine particulate matter and we see now on drudge last couple of
[43:07.720 --> 43:14.840]  days it's come back in the news because we picked up on the story here at info wars as the group
[43:14.840 --> 43:20.760]  that steve malloy was associated with his website is junk science dot com and it was american tradition
[43:20.760 --> 43:25.320]  institute at the time that filed a lawsuit a temporary restraining order that they were trying
[43:25.320 --> 43:31.240]  to get to stop this experimentation on people and of course it got to their attention because
[43:31.240 --> 43:37.640]  steve malloy happened to notice that this lady was sent to the hospital as part of some epa tests
[43:37.640 --> 43:42.680]  it turns out that they were actually selecting for people who had heart conditions and respiratory
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.400]  conditions because they wanted to try to make it look as bad as possible but we have a government
[43:47.400 --> 43:53.000]  that is ever bit capable of doing horrible human experimentation with people as we pointed out earlier
[43:53.000 --> 43:59.480]  this week when i talked to alex about the epa story and we've got a story that i think we haven't
[44:00.040 --> 44:05.480]  covered so much here at info wars a story about the government's history with ptsd
[44:05.480 --> 44:11.000]  and the way they treated world war two veterans and something even more frightening and that is
[44:11.000 --> 44:19.240]  what the what darpa is proposing to do in the future to cure ptsd but before we get away from this
[44:19.240 --> 44:25.800]  i want to talk about before we get away from police brutality i want to talk about why the
[44:25.800 --> 44:29.960]  government is doing this in so many cases of course it's being pushed from washington it's
[44:29.960 --> 44:34.680]  being pushed from homeland security but it is also being pulled from the private prison system
[44:34.680 --> 44:39.880]  look at this story that broke this week in arizona arizona republicans try to pump one million
[44:39.880 --> 44:45.400]  dollars into private prison for non-existent inmates now this is a situation where they have
[44:45.400 --> 44:53.560]  a contract with a prison company and we had a lot of these contracts put in after reagan put in the
[44:53.560 --> 45:00.360]  zero tolerance and the mandatory minimum prison sentences in 1984 for part of the drug war that
[45:00.360 --> 45:05.080]  was when he went from going after the people who were supplying drugs to the end user that was
[45:05.080 --> 45:08.840]  something that we had not seen during alcohol prohibition and while we're talking about alcohol
[45:08.840 --> 45:12.520]  prohibition while we're talking about a constitutional convention that people are trying
[45:12.520 --> 45:17.720]  to get involved here let's understand that they don't pay any attention to the constitution as it
[45:17.720 --> 45:23.320]  is right now it took a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol didn't it and it took another
[45:23.320 --> 45:28.600]  one to make it legal again after to undo that amendment why did it take a constitutional
[45:28.600 --> 45:34.760]  amendment to make alcohol prohibition illegal because clearly in the constitution they had
[45:34.760 --> 45:39.400]  no authority to do that the tenth amendment makes it clear that any powers that are not
[45:39.400 --> 45:45.160]  expressly explicitly delegated to the federal government they don't have and they did not
[45:45.160 --> 45:53.000]  have the explicit permission to prohibit anything alcohol shoelaces marijuana it doesn't matter
[45:53.000 --> 46:00.120]  they don't have the legal authority to do it now the difference between the 1920s and the 21st century
[46:00.760 --> 46:06.120]  is that in the 1920s they took the constitution seriously they don't even take it seriously
[46:06.120 --> 46:09.480]  why would we even bother to have a constitutional convention if we got a bunch of crooks who don't
[46:09.480 --> 46:13.720]  take their oath seriously who don't pay any attention to us in the constitution they now
[46:13.720 --> 46:19.480]  prohibit everything and you can't do anything whether it is a prescription drug or whether it's
[46:20.200 --> 46:25.320]  vitamins many cases are trying to outlaw vitamins or whether it's recreational drugs everything is
[46:25.320 --> 46:31.640]  prohibited unless expressly permitted by the FDA that's the way they have turned this on its head
[46:31.640 --> 46:36.920]  so when Reagan started with mandatory minimums sentencing and he started with zero tolerance
[46:36.920 --> 46:40.680]  that was a new thing they started putting so many people in jail that they were having to let
[46:40.680 --> 46:45.480]  violent criminals out rapists and murders are being turned out because their hands were tied
[46:45.480 --> 46:50.040]  they had to follow the orders of the federal government or so they said actually they were
[46:50.040 --> 46:52.520]  following the order so they could get the money from the federal government that's the way the
[46:52.520 --> 46:59.720]  government all the feds always work so we graded this massive system of private prisons and what
[46:59.720 --> 47:06.200]  is that doing that's putting a poll on the arrest records look at these statistics it costs nearly
[47:06.200 --> 47:11.720]  four times as much to keep an inmate in jail for a year as it costs to send a child to school for
[47:11.720 --> 47:18.680]  a year we have five percent of the global population but we have 25 percent of the world's prisoners
[47:18.680 --> 47:25.000]  we have more prisoners than china does and they've got a country that is many times larger than ours
[47:25.000 --> 47:34.040]  in population we've got one in 15 black men are in prison and we have one in 13 african americans
[47:34.040 --> 47:38.840]  unable to vote due to laws that deny the right to vote to x felon and so of course people are
[47:38.840 --> 47:44.280]  being arrested for things that in many cases do not threaten other people in many cases as we've
[47:44.280 --> 47:49.560]  talked about with marijuana quite frankly whatever your position is on marijuana legalization
[47:50.120 --> 47:53.800]  the government doesn't have the authority the federal government does not have the authority
[47:53.800 --> 48:00.200]  to prove to prohibit that if they did there wouldn't be a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol
[48:00.200 --> 48:06.120]  but let's take a look at this arizona story here private prison company's geo group coaxed about
[48:06.120 --> 48:10.040]  a million dollars out of arizona republicans despite assertions by the state department of
[48:10.040 --> 48:14.440]  corrections that the money's not needed based on the state's contract with the geo group now this
[48:14.440 --> 48:20.360]  is a guy he's a republican his name is cavanaugh and he said well last week they came back and they
[48:20.360 --> 48:26.280]  said look uh can you give us like uh at least 900 000 uh i thought that was reasonable so he
[48:26.280 --> 48:33.880]  sticks it in the budget at the very last minute now they came back the geo group had a uh reaction
[48:33.880 --> 48:39.720]  to this and they say that they have a contract with the state of arizona that provides for annual
[48:39.720 --> 48:44.680]  inflationary cost adjustments they haven't received one since 2007 the requested increase this year
[48:44.680 --> 48:50.360]  would have represented a 2 percent inflationary adjustment well fine but that doesn't explain
[48:50.360 --> 48:56.120]  why it was put in at the last minute very quietly like that and that's the way it's being represented
[48:56.120 --> 49:01.880]  by chad cambell a democrat from phoenix he said it was slipped in the last minute obviously behind
[49:01.880 --> 49:08.280]  closed doors geo happened to donate more than $2,500 to cavanaugh's 2012 campaign according to
[49:08.280 --> 49:14.920]  documents from the arizona secretary of state it's absolutely amazing to see this now arizona
[49:14.920 --> 49:21.640]  like many places has contracts with these private prisons where they're guaranteed 95 to 100
[49:21.640 --> 49:28.760]  percent occupancy in these private prisons now the prison system in question they have a 97
[49:28.760 --> 49:36.200]  percent occupancy they've got 2466 out of 2,530 prison beds occupied isn't that great we've got
[49:36.200 --> 49:40.680]  the police doing their job aren't they you know occupy filling up those prisons for the private
[49:40.680 --> 49:47.640]  companies who then use these guys as slave labor to boot it's a very very corrupt system
[49:47.640 --> 49:52.760]  and in arizona all but one house republican supported the measure they need to get that
[49:52.760 --> 49:58.520]  guy's name and give him a pat on the back but there's a great article that came out from
[49:58.520 --> 50:05.800]  dav hodges i saw it on dccloseline.com and he really pulls us back this is a bipartisan problem
[50:05.800 --> 50:09.880]  this is something that started with reagan but it is something that has continued on through the
[50:09.880 --> 50:16.600]  democrat administrations of clinton and of obama and he points out that obama is making money on
[50:16.600 --> 50:21.960]  privatized prisons and slave labor it's not just a republican situation they're both involved in
[50:21.960 --> 50:27.560]  this and he points out of course as i just mentioned that this goes back to 1984 when
[50:27.560 --> 50:33.800]  reagan stepped up the war on drugs and took it to the end user but he says and he's writing from
[50:33.800 --> 50:39.880]  arizona he says your state is my state and it has political whores that are beholden to privatized
[50:39.880 --> 50:44.840]  prison globalist corporations and it's time the facts behind the privatization of prisons
[50:44.840 --> 50:49.960]  are told and this conspiracy reaches right to the white house we're going to be back with more
[50:49.960 --> 50:54.840]  information about this right after the break and we're going to have a review of captain america so

[54:13.560 --> 54:18.520]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this friday april the fourth 2014 i'm david knight and we
[54:18.520 --> 54:24.200]  were talking just before the break about private prisons and as i pointed out i believe that private
[54:24.200 --> 54:29.640]  prisons are a pull just as the homeland security and the federalization of the milit of the police
[54:29.640 --> 54:35.880]  being militarized is a push we've got two things going on here and there's a lot of corporate action
[54:36.440 --> 54:42.360]  pulling for the privatization of prisons and there's a lot of very bad things going on as a
[54:42.360 --> 54:50.280]  result of that they're guaranteed to have between 95 and 100 occupancy in these prisons so that right
[54:50.280 --> 54:58.120]  there is a pull on the system to put people into prison we just had a case in arizona
[54:58.120 --> 55:02.760]  where a republican representative slipped in at the last minute a nine hundred thousand
[55:02.760 --> 55:08.040]  dollar bonus to the private prison group their geo group they're one of the largest prison
[55:08.040 --> 55:14.760]  corporations in america a very large corporation and he said i didn't see a problem giving them
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.480]  a small increase if you don't treat people fairly they won't treat you fairly in the future
[55:20.280 --> 55:26.760]  oh what could we read out of that uh all but one republican voted for the measure but it got
[55:26.760 --> 55:32.600]  stripped out when people saw what was happening there now this is also something that started
[55:32.600 --> 55:37.880]  with ronald reagan as part of the war on drugs or as i like to call it the war of drugs because
[55:37.880 --> 55:43.320]  we got the government that is creating the system and then using it to attack our legal system as
[55:43.320 --> 55:50.040]  well as american citizens but we've seen a lot of things happening with this private prison system
[55:50.040 --> 55:55.560]  and we've seen this continuing on and on throughout the democrat administrations and there's an
[55:55.560 --> 56:02.040]  excellent article here from a fellow who is uh i've got the name right here uh dav hodge
[56:02.040 --> 56:07.160]  editor of the common sense show he he's in arizona and he says this problem is not just my state's
[56:07.160 --> 56:12.520]  problem it's your state's problem as well it's in all of the states and he points out that
[56:12.520 --> 56:17.080]  as we mentioned before there's over two million inmates in american prisons one and seven hundred
[56:17.080 --> 56:21.400]  forty three people the u.s has only five percent of the world's population but 25 percent of the
[56:21.400 --> 56:28.040]  world's prison population well where does this go to he says this he ties us back to the obama
[56:28.040 --> 56:33.880]  administration and he says of course and we all know that obama could stop this but he does have
[56:33.880 --> 56:40.120]  some ties he connects the corporate dots to a company called vanguard actually it's an investment
[56:40.120 --> 56:46.120]  fund vanguard winsor two fund which obama is involved in but of course it doesn't matter
[56:46.120 --> 56:51.400]  whether they're democrats or republicans they are all there to work for the giant corporations
[56:51.400 --> 56:56.200]  whether it's creating private prisons or whether it's doing a massive transfer of wealth from the
[56:56.200 --> 57:02.040]  american people to the insurance companies you can always count on our politicians to step up to the
[57:02.040 --> 57:06.360]  plate but he makes an interesting point he talks about these private prisons he says this unholy
[57:06.360 --> 57:13.000]  practice is no less exploitative than the slave labor abuses of the past and as in all forms of
[57:13.000 --> 57:19.640]  slavery it is being fueled by profit mark my words fema camps will be privatized as well
[57:20.760 --> 57:24.920]  and he's got a a case here that he makes in
[57:24.920 --> 57:33.160]  Arizona but there's actually a case in Idaho and they have taken over the private prison
[57:33.160 --> 57:40.280]  there after horrifying allegations of corruption of theft and of brutality this is from a different
[57:40.280 --> 57:45.160]  corporation this is from a Nashville Tennessee based corrections corporation of america they
[57:45.160 --> 57:52.760]  were contracted to run the state prison in Idaho since 1997 taxpayers currently pay that company
[57:52.760 --> 57:59.400]  29 million dollars a year to operate a 2021 bed prison they say the prison has been the subject
[57:59.400 --> 58:05.800]  of multiple lawsuits alleging rampant violence understaffing gang activity and contract fraud
[58:05.800 --> 58:10.280]  they acknowledged last year they had falsified staff reports that they give them to the state
[58:10.280 --> 58:15.320]  showing that they had thousands of hours that's only part of it once they get people locked up
[58:16.040 --> 58:22.040]  then they use them as slave labor it kind of helps to take the bite out of losing business
[58:22.040 --> 58:26.760]  to the chinese you know we can get our own slave labor here and of course once the people get into
[58:26.760 --> 58:30.920]  prison they make it so difficult on the outside they have a 70 percent of the people come back
[58:30.920 --> 58:35.720]  can you do that with a restaurant i don't think so we're gonna be right back with some more news
[58:35.720 --> 58:41.960]  and we've got a review of captain america coming up at the bottom of the hour thank you for listening

[58:54.120 --> 58:59.160]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside
[58:59.160 --> 59:04.280]  that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[59:04.280 --> 59:09.720]  than even outdoor air and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[59:09.720 --> 59:15.080]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand
[59:15.080 --> 59:19.640]  types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six
[59:19.640 --> 59:24.440]  million americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics
[59:24.440 --> 59:30.280]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[59:30.280 --> 59:35.160]  that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated

[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.400]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david and i'll be your host today
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.880]  we're also going to be joined at the bottom of the hour with jacari jackson leon macadoo
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:42.040]  and kit daniels giving us their take on captain america now it's not going to have any spoilers
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.520]  in it i'm going to try to make sure that i'm going to i haven't seen it myself so i don't
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:52.360]  want to know any spoilers about it we do have a video review up if you've already seen it
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.480]  go take a look at our video review and get our take on where it fits in the liberty spectrum
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:03.000]  we had many of the crew went to see it last night i think it was an eight o'clock show around the
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.600]  nation it premiered and they put up a video afterwards giving their take on what they thought
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.360]  about the movie because it's got a lot of political overtones it's got a lot of connections to what
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:18.200]  we've been talking about today earlier what about the constitution does it should we have
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.560]  a constitutional convention to fix what's wrong with it or is what's wrong with government not
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:29.800]  the constitution but the people who swear an oath to it and then violate that oath the people who
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:36.040]  break the law if we have criminals in charge of the government would it make any difference what
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.840]  laws we write i mean that's essentially what we're talking about when we talk about gun control right
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.840]  we say well you know let's let's criminalize gun control for the law-abiding citizens the reality
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:52.840]  is is that people who are criminals aren't really paying any attention to the laws right now and
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.680]  that's what we have in our political class in washington we have a large group of criminals
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:05.560]  and no constitutional convention is going to bring them in line it's up to the people to get them
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:11.640]  back in line and we can talk about how that could happen but we're going to have that review at the
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.920]  bottom of the hour with the crew coming in here the captain america spoiler free review we also
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:23.080]  have coming up later in the show another special report from alex jones this one on climate change
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:27.320]  and what we're talking about climate change we've seen a lot of intolerance with that of course
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:36.680]  we've seen in the uk calls from mps calling for people to be censored and not allowed on
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.040]  network television to put in health claims of people are climate deniers i mean they basically
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.640]  are losing the argument on the science front on the hard data and so what they have to do is they
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.840]  have to censor people who are talking about that do they feel compelled to censor people who are
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.720]  talking about the earth being flat no because they don't have any compelling reason for that and
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.080]  there's a lot of compelling data that shows that the earth is not flat but they do have to censor
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:10.040]  people who deny their global warming narrative the narrative that they're using to try to affect
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:16.440]  complete sociological change they don't have the data to support that as a matter of fact the data
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:22.520]  conflicts directly with their climate models their climate models were predicated on a rapid rise
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:28.680]  in co2 causing global warming well we've had a very rapid rise in co2 and it has done just the
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:36.280]  opposite we don't see global warming in spite of them cooking the data and conspiring to cook the
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:42.920]  data in climate change climate gate one and climate gate two we were we caught them and emails saying
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:48.280]  that they wanted to hide the decline in global temperatures so there's a censorship there there's
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:55.000]  an intolerance there but we also see that that is being moved into other areas we see that the
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:03.960]  we see that the political left is pushing against hobby lobby we had john stewart calling the hobby
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.880]  lobby store that was standing up for their first amendment freedom of religion rights this company
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:16.600]  that was owned by family started as a small business he called them jesus christ super store
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.960]  and mocked them for resisting the fact that they were going to be forced to do something
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:28.040]  that violated their conscience you know thomas jefferson said the thing that he was most proud
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:34.200]  of in his life was the bill that he drafted for religious freedom and you know what if you lose
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.560]  your religious freedom if you lose your first amendment rights then you're also going to lose
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.800]  your fourth amendment rights and your fifth amendment rights your sixth amendment rights
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.600]  oh that's right we already have lost those haven't we we need to start standing up for all of those
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.760]  we're going to be right back with some more reports about what's going on with the police

[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:24.600]  and i'll be joined at the bottom of the hour with jacquard jackson leon macadoo and kit daniels
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:29.400]  you're going to be giving us their spoiler free take on captain america i know we all want to we
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:34.600]  have high hopes i haven't seen it yet myself so i'm going to make sure they don't give away anything
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:41.400]  but i have high hopes that it's a story about returning to the moral foundations of our country
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:49.560]  i think we've seen this country really go south and especially since let's say world war two
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:56.760]  there's been a public acceptance of corruption and of violating the laws we now see in congress when
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:04.200]  the irs can use be used as a tool against political enemies openly it's not that this
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.600]  hasn't been going on it went on with nixon of course he was impeached for that but it's been
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:14.280]  going on with all of these politicians democrat and republican and yet we see this come out in the
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:21.160]  open and stay there and nothing is being done about it that takes us morally to an all new
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:27.560]  low level the tolerance of the criminal behavior in washington and the cynicism that we see from
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.480]  people i think people are one of the pop one of the reasons i think that captain america is so
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:37.640]  popular is because people are aching for some kind of moral foundation they want to believe
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.800]  that there's somebody that is not going to be corrupted hopefully that's what this movie is
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:48.440]  about certainly look like that from the trailers but it also puts it in the in the current environment
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:54.040]  i think of a police state so we'll be talking about that hopefully not without uh we'll do that
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:00.840]  without any spoilers we're also going to be talking in the next hour about the shooting at
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:07.560]  fort hood the reactions to it what our government has done in the past about ptsd because of course
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:13.560]  ptsd isn't really the issue here he was not diagnosed with ptsd he had not been in combat
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:21.880]  so the issue is not necessarily ptsd but the issue is ssri drugs kit daniels and jacari jackson
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.200]  went to the press conference at fort hood they asked the question and they got the answer that's
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:31.640]  currently linked up on drudge reports on info wars dot com about the common connection with
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:38.760]  all of these mass shootings being ssri drugs that is the current way that the government is treating
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:45.240]  depression and suicidal tendencies and of course it pushes people in just the opposite direction
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:50.280]  then you want them to go it actually exacerbates those conditions under most uh with with many people
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:57.960]  but our government has a history of other things not uh just as we had the epa human testing scandal
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:03.320]  is now coming back because the epa a year after they got a judge to not put a temporary restraining
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.920]  order on them they're coming back with kind of a mea culpa and saying that well we really do need
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:14.280]  to review these procedures to make sure that this doesn't happen again well if there wasn't something
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:20.200]  wrong with it why do they need to review the procedures so that's come back into the uh and
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.360]  the stories we covered that about a year and a half ago uh it was steven alloy with junk science
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.720]  dot com who discovered that it was american tradition institute that tried to stop it
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:36.200]  but now it's come back and it's getting a lot of publicity coverage but our government has been doing
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:43.240]  these kinds of human experimentations not just on people not just with the epa not just of course
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:49.320]  there's a long history with the testigee institute as well as many other cases we talked about this
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:57.160]  a couple of days ago uh the cia under operation uh paperclip brought a lot of nazi scientists a lot
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.280]  of japanese scientists over of course they always want to just talk about vernervon brown
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.240]  there was a great parody piece so we ought to lead in with that and the next thing if we
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:13.480]  could find it i can't remember the guy's name but uh something like uh uh the rockets go up the rockets
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:19.240]  come down it's not my concern says vernervon brown right if he can help us build rockets to do
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:25.080]  satellites we don't care what he was helping the nazis build rockets to do right except that in the
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:31.320]  case of operation paperclip most of the scientists that they brought back that they took a very small
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.200]  number of them and held them up for a public display at the nuremberg trial but most of them
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.200]  that they could get their hands on they brought back and they were using them for biological
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:49.960]  and chemical testing on people very very dangerous idea very morally bankrupt idea there's a very good
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.280]  book written about the story of one of the scientists one of the american scientists who
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:01.000]  work with him frank olson it's called a horrible mistake he eventually realized what a horrible
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.920]  mistake it was to engage in these kind of experiments and he was suicided his sons are still
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:12.120]  trying to get justice from the federal government about that that book has an amazing chronology
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:20.440]  about operation paperclip a terrible mistake sorry not a horrible mistake a terrible mistake
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:25.560]  thank you for correcting me on that terrible mistake the story of frank olson and that book
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:31.320]  has an amazingly well researched chronology of what was going on with him and gives you insights
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.320]  into what was happening with the human testing and experimentation very dark stuff unfortunately at
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.040]  the beginning of the book the author says that well that was a dark time in our history and we're
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:49.080]  glad that we put that behind us hasn't been put behind us it's still there and our government
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:54.760]  is planning a much darker future we're going to talk about what DARPA is planning for PTSD
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.160]  and remember that it isn't just the veterans that the government is doing this to if they're going
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.320]  to do it to the people who serve them what do you think they're going to do to the people who are
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.840]  dissidents what do you think they're going to do to the general public you know it's not just
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.640]  people who are returning vets with PTSD that are getting these SSRIs they're giving them to
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:17.960]  children they're getting children hooked on this stuff we're seeing this happen across society
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:24.280]  and what DARPA is looking at in the future to treat PTSD is something that they're going to be
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.480]  applying broadly but we're going to look at not only that and not only the history of what the
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:35.320]  VA was doing to people right after World War II which is a very dark period of time where they
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:41.400]  were using lobotomies to returning World War II vets that's right you're having a problem because
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:45.880]  you were put in a Japanese prisoner of war camp for three years well we're going to make your life
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:52.200]  hell here on earth in America until we drive those memories out I mean that was the kind of
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:57.800]  treatment that they were giving them which in retrospect is not just horrible and cruel but
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:05.400]  just amazingly amazingly stupid it's like putting leeches on somebody who is suffering from a
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:11.640]  disease but as I said we're going to talk about what DARPA wants to do in the future but let's cover
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:16.280]  some of the other breaking news that's happening in this segment here we've got Venezuela is enforcing
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.160]  fingerprint registry in order to buy groceries this is a report that's up on info wars right now
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:27.480]  is written by Daisy Luther the organic prepper what if you were forced to register in order to buy
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.920]  groceries and what if through that registration the food you bought could be tracked and the
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.800]  quantities could be limited or maybe they could come back and confiscate what you've already bought
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.880]  well that's exactly the plan in Venezuela right now she writes the AP reports an effort to crack
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:48.200]  down on hoarding they're giving ID cards to families and they will have to be presented before
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:52.760]  food can be purchased and she says you think that this isn't going to happen in America well
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:59.560]  already the Obama administration has moved the pieces into place on the board to be able to
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:06.360]  appropriate supplies from anyone at any time as we've covered in the past from Max Lavo of
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:14.520]  SHTF plan and you know that's what we see over and over again we see the infrastructure of Tierney
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:21.560]  being put into place the infrastructure that has been put into place with the NDA with Homeland
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:27.640]  Security with the Viper teams with TSA with all these different aspects and now we see them
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:33.080]  actually starting to activate it we see them breaking into people's homes and of course
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.880]  this really goes back to the war on drugs the SWAT team stuff the idea that they would do
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:44.680]  no-knock raids the idea that they could confiscate anything that they declared to be contraband illegally
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:52.920]  during the war on drugs they were putting charges against airplanes against cash
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:17:00.760]  not against the people they were it was the US versus Learjet the US versus $9,000 in cash
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:09.160]  and the cash case you had a black man who was in a nursery business and he was flying from
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:14.680]  one place to another place to pick up a large truckload of things that he was going to drive
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:19.960]  back for his nursery business and he had $9,000 in cash to pay for it and they discovered this
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:24.680]  and this was like 20 years ago during the the war on drugs they discovered the $9,000 of cash
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:30.200]  and they just confiscated it he had a perfectly good reason they had no evidence that he was going
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.800]  to use it for drugs no reason to believe that he was going to use it for drugs but once they saw
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:40.440]  that he had the cash they just took it and they they created a case the US government versus $9,000
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:46.520]  in cash another case where he had a guy who had ferried people for what he thought was just a
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:51.640]  business meeting in his private plane his private jet he ferried them from the US to Canada they
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:55.240]  met with some people and he brought them back they're just carrying briefcases well it turns out
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:00.840]  that was part of a drug deal what the feds did was they confiscated his plane now they knew that
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:05.000]  he was not any part of the drug deal they knew they couldn't prove that he had anything to do with
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.080]  it because they knew that he wasn't involved in it he was just an innocent essentially a taxi
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:13.640]  driver they confiscated his plane which is essentially confiscating his business they
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:19.640]  destroyed him financially because of that and of course they charged the plane with being an
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:24.600]  accessory to the drug transaction because they couldn't make the case stick against the man
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:30.440]  they charged the inanimate object any government that is capable of that kind of Kafkaesque
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:36.760]  sophistry can come in and confiscate your food and as he points out think about the
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.720]  fact that now everything that you're buying is already being tracked with these rewards programs
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.400]  right the government could go back in and pull that information up if they wanted to
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.480]  and more news we see that the IMF is warning that we're going to have global stagnation if
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:59.240]  Ukraine is not bailed out you didn't realize that that was going to create a global collapse if
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:05.960]  we didn't bail out the Ukraine did you yes that's the baloney that Christine Lagarde is feeding
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.720]  everybody this is a story from Kurt Nemo that was up yesterday came up late yesterday
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:16.760]  Christine Lagarde has recycled the Bankster mantra that the globalist pushed for a bailout of the
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:21.320]  Ukraine she says geopolitical tensions in the Ukraine could cloud the global economic future
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:27.240]  well that sounds bad and it could have brought her spillover implications that's right the Ukraine
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:31.320]  now is going to take down the entire world economy if the bankers don't bail them out in a course
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.400]  who's going to pay for that the poor people of the Ukraine as he points out in the article
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:40.680]  she didn't mention that the IMF package will what it will do to the average Ukrainian it's going to
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.960]  be an austerity program like they've seen in Italy and elsewhere and people are rebelling to the
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:52.040]  point of secession in Italy over the austerity programs that were imposed by globalist bankers
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:56.200]  we're going to be back with more news and we're going to have a review of Captain America at the

[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:33.800]  for you of captain america brought up some real interesting questions as we looked at the trailer
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:37.160]  i think it's probably one of the most anticipated movies of the year we are not going to spoil it
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:43.880]  for you i haven't seen it myself but i do want to kind of i'm curious as to how this fits in the
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:47.880]  liberty spectrum now it's just going over some economic news before we went to the break and
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:54.200]  there's a couple of other pieces here i want to cover with you shocking facts about the deindustrialization
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.400]  of america that everyone should know this is from info wars dot com today it's an article by michael
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:06.040]  snider and he's pointing out what what triggered this article is the fact that the u.s trade deficit
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:13.240]  jumped in february uh climbed to the highest level in five months in february it was 7.7 percent higher
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:20.120]  than in january this is money that is bleeding out of america as he points out in the opening
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:25.080]  statement he said how can how long can america continue to burn up wealth how long can this
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:31.160]  nation continue to consume far more wealth than it produces and he goes through in the article he says
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:38.120]  we sold 122 billion dollars worth of stuff to china sounds like a lot but we bought from them
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:47.000]  440 billion dollars worth of things and he shows the trade deficit with just china going from 1990
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:54.200]  until currently where it is now 318 billion dollar trade deficit with china 318 billion
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:26:00.040]  dollar trade deficit that's larger than the gross domestic product of many many countries
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:04.680]  and he says it's been estimated that the u.s economy loses approximately 9 000 jobs for every
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:11.320]  one billion dollars of goods that are imported from overseas and one last statistic i'll give you
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:22.280]  he says since 2001 the united states has lost more than 56 000 manufacturing jobs well it's not
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:29.400]  just from attacks abroad from trade deficits with other countries like china that we are being
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:35.960]  blood to death we're also being blood to death with mandates from our federal government somebody
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.040]  has to pay for these obama care mandates it's going to be coming out of the pockets of the
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.960]  people who are buying insurance or their employers who are going to be buying insurance for them and
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:50.920]  it is as we pointed out over and over again it is a huge increase anywhere up to five times people
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:55.480]  are seeing their insurance policies go up now we learn from the article from national journal
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:02.280]  that 15 to 20 percent of the people aren't paying their obama care premiums that's news from blue
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.720]  cross blue shield one of the biggest players in obama's exchanges they're saying that 15 to 20
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:12.040]  percent of the new customers aren't paying for their first premiums which means that they're not
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:17.320]  actually covered so even if we can believe these figures that the obama administration is putting
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.840]  out and there's a lot of reason not to believe anything they say because we've seen not just
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:28.520]  the obama administration but every administration always puts out unemployment figures they will
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:34.040]  put them out one quarter and then they'll revise them the next quarter and they're constantly changing
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:39.480]  these things to make the current situation always look better so they revise it the bad news they
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:44.360]  revise upward from earlier periods so they they can make current stuff look better and of course
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.520]  he's taking it to all new levels he's not just talking about the creation of jobs which the
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:56.760]  federal government doesn't create jobs okay private sectors individuals create jobs all they do is
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.720]  create bureaucracies which are drained on the productive part of the economy but he's taking
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:07.240]  it to a new level where he says these are jobs saved now you can just make up any number you
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:12.360]  want to to put in that so when we see that kind of nonsense coming out of the federal government
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.440]  when they start talking to us about how many people signed up for obama care can we really trust
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:21.960]  that now the government has given us the number that it's about seven million people that have signed
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:27.880]  up but if you apply this across the board because blue cross blue shield is not located any one
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:33.640]  particular area they're pretty much across the united states so their figures are likely to be
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:37.480]  pretty much the experience across the country so 15 to 20 percent of people are not paying their
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.120]  premiums which means that they're not insured that would take even if you go with obama's number of
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:46.920]  seven million people that would take it down to about six million people that they say are covered
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:53.080]  out of about 350 million is that something that we should be excited about two percent coverage
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:59.240]  is that something that is uh that's really great news now one last bit of news before we go to the
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:05.960]  break here there was a great piece from andrew sullivan uh dish dot andrew sullivan dot com
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:12.840]  he called it the hounding of a heretic and he talks about how homosexuals lobbied to get a
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:18.040]  mozella executive fired he said the guy who had the gall to express his first amendment rights
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.760]  and favor proposition eight in california by donating a thousand dollars has just been
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:28.440]  scalped by some gay activists he says will he now be forced to walk through the streets in shame
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:34.600]  if this is the gay rights movement today hounding our opponents with a fast fanaticism more like
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.760]  the religious right than anyone else then count me out good for andrew sullivan that's what we've

[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.720]  welcome back to the alex joneshow and he just heard in that break defending the republic
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:32.120]  against enemies foreign and domestic well i think that's what the captain america movie
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:36.200]  is about at least that's what the trailer was about i haven't seen the film myself but a lot
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:41.720]  of the info wars crew went to see it last night and we've got reports from them we've got jacari
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:46.920]  jackson kit daniels and leon macadoo are going to give us their take on it and no spoilers because
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.160]  i know just like you i haven't seen it i don't want to know anything in this movie
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:01.320]  okay all right so so guys on a scale of 1776 to 1984 where does this fit i think it's closer
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:08.840]  to 1776 if we're going to be technical i'd say 1787 okay all right just just before the constitution
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:13.960]  was ratified okay we're under the articles of confederation it's a very good move we'll try to
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:20.360]  be as as vague as far as the plot details but to talk about the setup in the film you have shield
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:26.200]  which is pretty much dhs on the super soldier serum right so it's this big arms domestic buildup you
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:30.600]  know because in the real world real world we have dhs they're buying the bullets they have the paper
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:35.960]  targets they have tsa agents carrying guns now they have viper teams and the movie shield represents
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:41.560]  pretty much dhs in a more financially lucrative time you know they have the arms and all the other
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.600]  things that they need so that's very concerning to me and i hope people who can understand our
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:51.880]  current situation as far as dhs and domestic arms can understand the parallel in the movie when you
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:57.000]  give this much power this much finance and resource to a particular agency to carry out a task you
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.120]  have to be wary of the fact that not everybody in that organization has the best your best interest
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.680]  in heart so like the real world you've got the military industrial complex on steroids you've
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:12.600]  got a super soldier program which is a real world thing i mean we've got coming up later in the
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:18.120]  program i'm going to talk about uh the brain initiative that's actually an acronym brain is
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:23.240]  actually an acronym and of course obama has doubled down on that budget and it involves DARPA
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:30.760]  and DARPA also has a real life super soldier program don't they oh yeah really yeah very very
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.320]  scary stuff and of course this is something that's been going on for a long time this is something
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:40.200]  that we were warned about by eisenhower with the military industrial complex that you would have
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:47.000]  not only the people who are building the weapons involved in this incestuous relationship with
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.720]  the government but it would subsume all scientific research as well right yeah the movie reminded me
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:59.160]  of a lot of neoconservative think tanks like the project for new american century where they
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:05.160]  pretty much advocated uh order out of chaos which is often order out of artificial chaos
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:12.760]  so there's a lot of illusions to that in the film where and a lot of illusions to
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:17.640]  eliminate threats before they become threats which we also seen a lot of philip k dick books with
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:24.200]  pre crime so and so forth yeah oh yeah yeah very much so and we see you know the they do the
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.680]  the kind of data mining thing that we have to spy on you to keep you safe right so
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:33.000]  they're looking at your internet searches they're tapping your phones you know we have the reports
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.240]  out of the phone tapping all the stuff going on and you see this not just in the new film but you
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.160]  saw also in the avengers right because you know the threats out so we're going to tap everybody's
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:45.160]  phone we're going to be looking in the the traffic cameras and it's more of the same in the new film
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:50.360]  and we also saw this in 2002 in the new york times with the uh article on total information
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:56.600]  awareness where the department of defense wanted to take every americans personal records travel
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:04.200]  finance criminal education so on so forth even maybe your library books you uh oh yeah in order
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:09.800]  to predict your future behavior and create a risk profile on you so they could say well you know
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:15.160]  maybe he might this is behavior it's suspicious well so we pointed out before uh metadata can
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.640]  actually be more useful for that than listening to your phone conversations or reading your emails
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:23.240]  because they can look at that metadata and they can predict where you're going to be in the next
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:28.360]  24 hours more accurately than you can and at the time that was just about a month or so ago
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:33.560]  paul joes of watson pointed out that there was a uh homeland security bid for a system that was
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:38.840]  going to essentially record license plates license plate database and the next day they took that
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:46.120]  down after it got the publicity but concurrently with that you've got ibm and cisco working together
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:51.480]  to create a literal information highway where they're going to they're going to provide social
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:56.520]  media to you as you're driving down the road it's going to be the they're going to be providing in
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:00.200]  the roadbed you know internet for you but they're also going to be watching you they're going to
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:05.320]  be recording your license plate information all that sort of thing so that really is where they
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:12.040]  are so i guess the question what the movie is do they present that as a positive thing no actually
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:16.760]  not and that's what i was thought was so refreshing about this movie not just this one but we saw it
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:21.640]  also in someone in the avengers and also an iron man three which was a terrible movie but they have
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:25.640]  the good premise of they're talking about the false flag they're talking about the fall guy your
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:30.280]  puppets you know who being controlled by the big boys and marvel's moving in that direction so i do
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:34.520]  definitely give them credit for that i'm not a big fan of all things disney but i at least give
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:40.200]  them credit for their movies as far as being a pro liberty because captain america uh he doesn't
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.840]  represent the government he represents the american people right so he's he's a real all american guy
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:48.920]  he says you know i went out there and i fought for freedom what you guys are doing here is fear and
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:54.040]  he says that in the trailer to uh samuel jackson nick fury he says i want people to be free i don't
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:58.760]  just this world we have to be being there i know he's a fictional character but captain america
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:03.240]  is came out of the greatest generation and he was educated under the constitution bill of rights
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:09.080]  i remember i think it was in 1928 there was a department army manual that pointed out that
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:15.240]  our country's republic not democracy that is something that's not hot in any public education
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:20.040]  center at all in america anymore absolutely absolutely uh i want to play that trailer
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:23.960]  give people a sense of it if they haven't heard it and we also want to talk to uh leah macadam
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.400]  and get her take on who have to switch out kit because we've got two microphones there was
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:32.440]  anything else did you want to say kit before we before we switch out well right before uh the
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:37.080]  movie they're doing a little trivia night at the draft house where they were pulling someone out
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.440]  the audience of the theater and asking them questions and the questions were like well
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.360]  who was the second president when was the constitution ratified so and so forth
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:50.040]  none of the people were getting any of the questions correct really so i was thinking about
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:55.720]  at the end of the movie that in order for all of us to get out this mess that we're in we all
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:00.280]  have to be captain america we all have to be superheroes in an intellectual debate in an
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:08.360]  information war that's right so we got to transform from being blueless about basic trivia on the
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:13.720]  foundation of our country to becoming captain america that's right and we're not going to have
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:18.920]  a superhero get elected as president or anything else is going to get us out of this mess we have
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:23.000]  to do it ourselves it's all grassroots exactly i learned from the ron paul movement it's all
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.240]  grassroots and it's knowing what your rights are and understanding as you pointed out we have a
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:33.400]  republic not a democracy but we also have a constitution that guarantees rights that transcend
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:38.280]  the government the constitution was there to say you know what these rights are already in place
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:44.200]  you can't go beyond these certain restrictions and they don't give us our rights so many people
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:48.440]  think that the constitution gives us our rights and they don't and so we need to understand that
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.280]  i i believe that nothing can come out of a constitutional convention except bad stuff
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:58.840]  and what i mentioned yesterday on the show that applies here is that the federalists and the
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.880]  anti-federalists they didn't even debate on any of them hardly anything on the bill of rights
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:10.040]  because they all agreed with them basically james madison wrote truisms that they all agreed with
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.400]  yes yes very different from today let's take a look at this uh clip and we're going to bring in
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:23.960]  leon macadoon get her take on this most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.480]  the ones that do call him the winter soldier
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.640]  he's a ghost you'll never find him
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.640]  you
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.120]  they join shield to protect people
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:55.320]  you have to to build a better world sometimes means turning the old one down that makes enemies
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:07.400]  so a lot of this is visual doesn't necessarily make for great radio so we're going to come back
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.640]  and get leon macadoo's take on this we've been talking to jacari jackson and kit daniels the
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:16.840]  crew went to see captain america last night leon tell us your take on it without any spoilers
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:19.800]  because i haven't seen it and a lot of people that are listening haven't seen it because it just
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:25.160]  premiered last night one or two shows nationwide really today is the big premiere day yeah kid
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:32.280]  i see you've been taking your super female vitality there yeah well it's um for me it was
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.600]  i mean great visually it was very entertaining but it's got so much subliminal messages there
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:44.120]  for people that might not read info wars every day they are going to be introduced to this
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:49.960]  to what's going on because basically i feel like the writers read info wars and just put this movie
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:56.760]  together i mean all the themes are there and it's basically like it seems futuristic but it's america
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:01.880]  it's the world today this is these are the globalists this is what's happening and kit mentioned
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:08.520]  this in the in the review that they kind of set it up where it's it's the surveillance state is
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:12.920]  it's already there there's no question how did the world get like this how did the police state
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.480]  become like this how did this all you know how do we get to where we are it just it is
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:23.640]  and there's no question of how did this world become what it what it has become and so that's
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:27.400]  you know that's something that we all need to sort of say well why are we just kind of being
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.760]  coaxed into this reality like this is what's going to happen you've just got to accept it
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:38.440]  and basically it was um just so telling to me that the globalists that were kind of in charge of
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:45.400]  everything they use so much double speak in the movie and for that to just expose people to double
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:50.840]  speak and how they can someone can say something about how they're trying to build a better world
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:57.400]  right and in order to build a better world which is their version of better they've got to tear down
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:03.000]  the current world and so people are they're going to be exposed to to just how they're tearing down
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.720]  the world and creating chaos and how they're creating the chaos well you know you touched on
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:11.880]  something i think is very important and that is you know we can give people facts we can give them
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:15.880]  the news we can give them documentaries and documentaries are very very compelling because
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:22.040]  they can go very in depth into a story and there's also a visceral component of that because
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:26.360]  as part of a documentary you're going to see video clips you're going to hear about people's
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:30.920]  personal experiences it's going to personalize it instead of it just being a policy statement
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:35.080]  but when we have a work of fiction like this and i think that's what everybody wanted to know as
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:40.120]  as i asked kid actually it was my son it came up with that on a scale of 1776 and 1984 where does
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:48.280]  it fall you know we want to know is this going to resonate with us viscerally is it going to
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:53.320]  present the real problems that we face in this country with the police state with the surveillance
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:58.280]  state i think it definitely does you know as far as you know a movie to take your kids to i think
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.720]  the first one's probably more visually appealing to a child but this one if you're up on the facts
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.880]  and you know what's going on in the real world you can draw these comparisons very similar
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:12.760]  just uh used to talk about dhs being shield and many other comparisons i won't go into right now
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.160]  because i don't want to spoil the movie but there's a lot of real stuff being mentioned or at least
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:21.880]  things that you can parallel pretty closely to real world events and real world problems going on
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:28.040]  in this film that's interesting i saw a review from a couple of days ago on mpr now i'm just kind
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:32.200]  of wondering from somebody that's seen it now their take on it it was titled captain america
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:37.720]  anthropotomic and i'm just wondering if this is kind of from their dc centric perspective or what
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:42.760]  let me just read you a little uh section of this i say the triskellion i guess is the big building
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.160]  is it merely on the beautiful potomic but in it jutting out to dangle over the water
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:52.520]  incidentally and ironically a blurring a fair amount of actual landscape they talk about how
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:59.800]  the potomic area and the washington dc area is kind of put out there pastorly in the film
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:05.560]  and dc looks like it's organic and here you've got this skyscraper police state
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.200]  icon that is kind of jutting out into it did did that come across to you that way or is that really
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:16.120]  kind of their perspective on it i'm curious i mean it is a very large building and like said dc
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:22.120]  is the backdrop so i wouldn't say that's a unfair criticism of the film but i don't think that's
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:26.280]  too much what the film's actually about well they were actually saying i think they're they're
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:31.880]  taking on it they were kind of surprised that in the film they they saw because it was set in dc
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:36.440]  they kind of saw dc as as representative of america well that's not typically the case
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:43.400]  i want to say that that's the level of corruption and you know deception that's actually going on
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:50.440]  and just you know tying it into reality right now it's a great thing for people to if you are a
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:55.320]  policeman or you know working for the cia or whatever maybe you're not a bad guy but look to
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:00.200]  your right look to your left you don't know what agenda these guys have because it's all
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:06.120]  compartmentalized and you you don't know what the the the people who are working behind the scenes
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:10.920]  what their big agenda is where they're what they're working you know i think one of the things that
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:16.520]  makes captain america so compelling to everybody is that for the longest period of time we've
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:21.560]  always we've seen in an effort to try to make a protagonist more believable they give them
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:27.480]  elements of darkness and now it's become so bad that we see the heroes of many movies today
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:33.560]  are much worse than the villains of 20 30 years ago certainly of the the villains in the movies
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:38.200]  that i was watching as a kid and so when we see captain america who's this guy who has this
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.880]  straight moral foundation he's got a solid moral foundation he knows what he believes he's going
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:49.720]  to stand on it he's going to do what he believes is right and and we see that kind of contrasted
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:56.040]  with tony stark is pretty much a representative of current society the military industrial complex
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:59.880]  amoral anything for money and it's like i can spend every once in a while he does something
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:05.080]  altruistically but he has to kind of be pulled into it you know yeah i think that's the thing
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:10.520]  about captain america that really stood out in the first one that's straight up earnestness yeah i'd
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:16.440]  say the only real criticism i would have on the film is that everybody you know your crooked people
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:21.160]  they weren't official government politicians they're kind of all these offshoots so they didn't really
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.800]  touch on the real political corruption that could or you know would happen in the real world i think
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:29.560]  there's like like one crooked senator but by and large they don't talk about you know how does the
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:33.400]  president feel about this or how does congress congress feel about all these things it's more
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:39.000]  of this kind of shadow dhs type group i see so it's kind of a they're they're kind of giving
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:44.760]  a pass to the politicians yeah letting them off the hook a little bit well they also had
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:49.320]  bringing it all in um there was just so many different themes in this movie and they had
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:55.160]  you know the singularity was a big part of this movie and how they were working toward that as
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:00.520]  well they pulled an operation paperclip kind of tied that into how that was working for the new
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:08.280]  world order there was um chris saw some some bangazi-esque scene there yeah we don't want to
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.600]  elaborate too much on that but there there's a situation that happens in the film that you can
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:18.920]  mirror toward towards tamba of type of a Benghazi situation well certainly the super soldier as we
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:25.240]  mentioned the beginning of the discussion with kit daniels in here the super soldier and what
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:30.520]  DARPA is working on that is not really science fiction anymore i mean that that is really the
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:36.440]  basis of their research and it's very troubling to me to see that you've got DARPA which has a
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:43.320]  research budget that is bigger than the military spending of most countries and what they are
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:49.640]  involved in it's almost like they go in and they take the any new technology whether it is uh
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:55.880]  electronics or whether it's uh biological everything that they do they always seem to go in and take
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:00.600]  find the darkest way that it could be applied you know the most perverse way that the technology
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:04.760]  could be because any technology is nothing but a tool it can be used for good or can be used for
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:10.360]  evil except DARPA always looks for the most evil application of it using the super soldier for
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:14.840]  good or for evil you remember in the first captain america film that he didn't originally want to
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:19.480]  accept rogers not just because of his physical stature but because there's another guy who
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:24.120]  thought it was more police state line he's like so-and-so as a soldier he's going to do what we
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:28.520]  tell him he's going to kill who we tell him to kill and do what we tell him to do and as you see
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:32.600]  not only the last movie but in the new movie you know captain america he has that line
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:36.040]  he says you know i'm going out to keep people safe i'm not doing your black ops i'm not doing
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:40.200]  all this stuff i'm i'm here to be a soldier not a spy that's right in the very first movie the
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:46.440]  scientist who was a chief scientist and had to say so he picked him because he had moral character
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:52.040]  that's the thing that is going to win this is moral backbone and it makes everybody into a
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:56.520]  super soldier great review thank you so much for filling us in on that and you didn't give anything
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:00.520]  away i gotta say i i still want to see it i think everybody's gonna miss movie all right we'll be

[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:49.800]  an article on info wars if you don't conform the thought Nazis will get you and we were talking
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.280]  just before they came in for the review of captain america before the info wars crew came in we were
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:56:00.440]  talking about the intolerance that we're seeing rising in this country now this article is up
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:05.960]  on info wars.com michael snider points out that this guy that was just driven out of mozilla the
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:13.720]  ceo who was driven out of there had a was driven out because he supported proposition eight that's
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:18.840]  the proposition in california that supported traditional marriage and it doesn't matter he
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:24.440]  points out that it was passed by 52 percent of the voters it doesn't matter that he gave a thousand
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:28.280]  dollars to it and it doesn't matter that he did things like inventing the programming language
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:34.520]  javascript and that he co-founded mozilla instead they pushed him out and i was reading just a brief
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.000]  quote i want to read a little bit more this quote from andrew sullivan it's on his website
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:47.160]  dish dot andrew sullivan dot com and he said what we really need to have said by both sides on this
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:53.400]  debate on so many things i've seen so much intolerance from the left when it comes to
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:59.240]  religion or when it comes to tolerance of religion they can be incredibly intolerant
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:03.960]  in the name of tolerance that's the irony of it that's what's so bad about it and that's what
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:10.440]  andrew sullivan points out here he says will this fellow who's just been pushed out of mozilla
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:14.520]  will he be forced now to walk through the streets in shame why not put him in stocks
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:20.200]  he said this whole episode disgusts me as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:25.800]  and diverse society if this is the gay rights movement today hounding our opponents with a
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:31.720]  fanaticism more like the religious right than anyone else then count me out if we're about to
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:37.560]  if we are about intimidating the free speech of others we are no better than the anti-gay
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:43.720]  bullies who came before us and we have seen that not just about homosexual marriage we've also seen
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:49.400]  that about exercising your religious freedom and not participating in the murder of infants
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:56.280]  we have a supreme court case a case that's been argued last week before the supreme court
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:01.880]  they're currently deciding on it that's the case of course of hobby lobby and another company
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:07.560]  conestoga furniture or something like that it's a smaller company people are arguing
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:12.040]  that they don't lose their first amendment protection of religious freedom just because
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:19.640]  they create a company and they cannot be compelled to pay for abortions we also saw this another
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:24.040]  story from don salazar boy forced to stop bringing the bible in an after school program but in this
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:29.960]  case the aclu is defending him not attacking religious freedom that's good news we've seen
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:34.760]  that the army is no longer going to use the southern poverty law center that's good news i'm sorry
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:39.080]  not the army the fbi so maybe things are starting to change we're going to be right back with some
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:51.400]  more news stay tuned this is gcn the genesis communications radio network in the last 50

[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:09.400]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:15.880]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the

[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:29.880]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night i'll be your host today and we've got a lot
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.400]  of news coming up we've got alex jones is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour with a
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:39.480]  special report on climate change that's part of the intolerance that we've seen we were just talking
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:45.720]  about how there is so much intolerance towards religious freedom and you know what folks even
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:52.360]  if you're an atheist you need to support religious freedom just like you need to support other people's
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:56.200]  freedom of speech those two are connected together in the first amendment for good reason
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:00.840]  if you're going to attack religious freedom you're going to lose free speech as well so
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:07.000]  don't use your free speech to attack religious freedom try to be tolerant and being tolerant
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.400]  doesn't mean that you coerce other people into recognizing and subsidizing things like homosexual
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:18.520]  marriage you can still have tolerance where people are allowed to live their lives and maybe what we
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:24.600]  should do is what ron paul said and that is get the government out of the marriage business you
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:32.440]  know they weren't always there in the 1700s it was the purview of the uh of the churches they they
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:38.440]  kept records of births of deaths of marriages what happened was that it just kind of fell back into
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:44.120]  the purview of the of the government because they had people who were going from one town to the other
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:49.160]  having multiple wives it became there were several high profile cases as many people
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:53.800]  pointed out bad law is predicated on bad cases and what they did at that time they decided
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:57.880]  that they were going to centralize record keeping that's how we got into the situation where government
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:04.040]  defined what marriage is and many conservatives might push back and say but i i like the traditional
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:09.320]  definition that we've had of marriages and that's fine push for that persuade people of that
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:16.360]  government is not the only tool that you've got and whether you're a conservative christian or
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:22.760]  whether you're an atheist you need to start looking at tools that are not only non-coursive
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:29.640]  but persuasive but understand that government is not the proper way to change society if you've got
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:33.640]  a hammer if that's the only tool that you've got then everything looks like a nail as they've said
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:39.160]  and unfortunately to many people whether they're conservatives or liberals the only hammer they
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:43.080]  think they've got the only tool they've got is a hammer the government and they hammer everybody
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:48.760]  with it we need to try to persuade people especially the christians need to try to persuade and not
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:55.720]  coerce people and basically we're not trying to coerce people not going around arresting people
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:03:00.280]  who are living their lives in their homes because they're engaged in homosexual activity there was
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:05.480]  a time when that did happen that is not what's happening now but now we have the opposite
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:10.680]  effect that is taking place now we have people who are getting sued because they don't want to
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:17.080]  participate in a homosexual wedding for example as a photographer as somebody who is providing
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:25.480]  services or whatever we need to support people's ability to make choices that's what this is all
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:31.240]  about and we see a lot of intolerance in a lot of different areas about that whether it is the
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:36.440]  government forcing people to provide abortion coverage in their companies or whether it's a
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:42.040]  child who is trying to have the freedom to read his bible during a study hall in school we see a
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:46.760]  tremendous amount of intolerance we need to understand what voltair said he said i may not agree
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:51.320]  with what you say but i'll defend to death you're right to say that and we don't see that from too
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:57.000]  many people but i read a great quote from andrew sulliman in the last segment where he was very
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:03.400]  upset about what just happened with the mozilla executive who was shoved out because he had supported
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:08.920]  proposition eight for traditional marriage again i think the way to do this is to roll this back
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:14.840]  and not allow the government to have to say so allow people to do free association allow people to
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:20.360]  make the choice as to whether or not they want to in their business to subsidize what kind of
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:24.840]  relationships where they want to subsidize marriages at all whether they're homosexual
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:28.360]  heterosexual they should be able to make that determination instead of having it forced upon
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:32.440]  them the first time i ever heard about homosexual marriage was when i was taking a libertarian
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:38.600]  candidate around and he was asked that question and his answer to that was exactly right he says
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:42.760]  you're trying to use government to force people to subsidize something they would not normally do
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:47.640]  or to force them to do it through the government i don't think that's the libertarian position
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:52.280]  it wasn't 20 years ago i don't think it should be today we're going to be right back we've got some

[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:23.640]  it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today and
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:29.240]  and there is a bad moon rising if you're aware of the captain america story as you probably saw
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:34.040]  the first movie and it's probably the most anticipated movie of this year open last night
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:40.120]  for a couple of showings across the country today is really kind of the official rollout date and
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:47.080]  of course that is predicated on the idea of the super soldier super soldier is not a science
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:52.360]  fiction idea anymore this is something that the government is heavily heavily investing in
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:58.760]  and but i want to take this forthood shooting that happened this week and the responses to it
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:04.840]  and look at that as well as the way our government has treated veterans in the past the way they're
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:11.480]  treating them now and what they are proposing what darpa is proposing to do to military with ptsd
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:18.040]  in the future and as we get to that we're going to look at darpa's idea for their future soldier
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:25.240]  for their biotech soldier for their super soldier now as this shooting happened a lot of people
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:30.200]  were talking about ptsd and of course he was not diagnosed with ptsd he was not in battle
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:37.240]  he did have a gun in an area that had been declared a gun-free zone during the clinton
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:42.920]  administration and has been left that way throughout subsequent republican administration
[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:49.240]  and of course obama is not changing that either it shows the bankruptcy of the idea that here are
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:55.800]  people that we're going to hand not only sidearms too but every kind of firearm rocket launchers
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:10:01.400]  tanks you name it missiles but they cannot be allowed to have firearms to protect themselves
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:06.200]  to protect others that's absolute nonsense and as i mentioned at the beginning of the show that's
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:12.680]  the same kind of thinking that harasses airline pilots and tries to confiscate their nail clippers
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:18.280]  in the name of making the plane safe from terrorism okay if you're going to take away the
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:23.080]  nail clippers from the pilots if you're going to take away the sidearms from the soldiers on the
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:28.680]  base that's just idiotic just idiotic the person's a problem they don't need to be an airline
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:33.800]  pilot or a soldier but if they're there they've already got the tools to do far more damage
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:40.040]  than what you're talking about taking away from them now the thing that concerned me about this
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:48.120]  was as i heard a lot of conservative people saying that we need to get that these military bases and
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:53.960]  this is a story that had a lot of local coverage here in the austin area as well as it being a
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:58.520]  national story because fort hood is not that far away it's just a couple of miles a couple of hours
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:04.920]  away from austin and so there was a lot of talk on local talk radio about it and as i was driving in
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:10.200]  the other day i heard these guys talking about it and made the comment one of them made the comment
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:18.200]  fort hood is just filled with crazy people and the other guy who was kind of a conservative
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.280]  kind of pulled back and said you can't say that not because he didn't think they were crazy but
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:30.760]  because he wanted to find some more politically correct term to use look this is the this is the
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.720]  kind of trap that is the most dangerous kind of trap for gun control and i've seen some people in
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:40.440]  the nra say that we need to have psychological evaluation and permission from the government
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:45.960]  in order for anybody to have guns this is something that's not going to just affect veterans this is
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:51.960]  something that's going to affect everybody the way that tyrannies in the 20th century preferred to
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:57.320]  lock get rid of dissidents to get rid of any opposition was to declare them as crazy it's
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:03.240]  very easy to declare somebody insane it's very difficult to prove that you are sane especially
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:09.960]  when somebody has said that you're insane remember the movie one flew over a cuckoo's nest remember
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:14.680]  jack Nicholson came in pretending to be insane so that he could get out of the ordinary prison he
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:22.520]  thought it was going to be a a cakewalk in the sanatorium and and he runs into a test of wills
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:29.160]  with nurse ratchet and eventually that ends sorry spoiler alert i'm sure most of you have seen it
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:35.160]  it's it's want to go back and look at again but it ends with a lobotomy and that pretty much discredited
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:43.640]  the idea of lobotomy dramatic narratives can be very very effective in terms of waking people up
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:48.920]  now you need to be able to step in with the facts afterwards but it it's that kind of visceral connection
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:54.360]  really does wake people up and that's why we spent time talking about captain america because it
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:01.160]  addresses some fundamental core issues that we need to address right now in this country and i want
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:06.280]  to go back and look at the history of the way veterans have been treated in this country especially
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:11.400]  some who went through the most some of the most horrendous conditions of world war two being
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:16.600]  interred in japanese prisoner of war camps for years when they came back they had they were
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:21.480]  deeply troubled psychologically and they took them into the va and and there was an excellent
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:27.240]  series that was done by michael m phillips for the wall street journal back in december of 2013
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:35.080]  i think the guy deserves a bullet surprise for this great research great story what he found was
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:44.360]  that the va the u.s government lobotomized over 2000 soldiers after world war two listen to this
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:48.600]  particular account there you see on the screen is is one fellow that they talked to his name is
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:54.440]  roman tritz and he says roman tritz's memories the past six decades are blurred by age and illusion
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:59.240]  but one thing he remembers clearly is the fight he put up the day the orderlies came for him
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:03.160]  he said they got the notion they were going to come and give me lobotomy to hell with them
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:07.720]  the orderlies at the veterans hospital pinned him to the floor he recalls he fought so hard they
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:14.200]  eventually gave up but the orderlies came for him again on wednesday july 1st 1953 a few
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:20.680]  weeks before his 30th birthday the u.s government lobotomized about 2000 mentally ill veterans
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:25.800]  and likely hundreds more he points out he said the va performed the brain altering operations on
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:31.960]  former servicemen that it had diagnosed as depressives or psychotics or schizophrenics
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:37.800]  and they occasionally did it to people they identified as homosexuals now mr tritz the
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:43.560]  guy that you just saw up there if you're watching this on the screen he's now 90 years old and as
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:49.240]  he was being interviewed he said it isn't so good up here he said as he pointed to his head tapped
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:56.040]  his head the va's use of lobotomy in which doctors severed connections between parts of the brain
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:01.960]  that were then thought to control emotion was known in medical circles in the late 1940s and early
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:08.760]  1950s is occasionally cited in medical texts but the va's practices were never publicized they were
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:14.600]  long ago pulled out of the public's view now here's what he underwent before they gave him
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:20.760]  the lobotomy he underwent 28 rounds of electroshock therapy and they point out in the article this is
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:27.160]  a common treatment that sometimes caused convulsions that were so jarring that they broke patients
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:33.480]  bones can you imagine that this poor fellow had spent three years in a japanese prisoner of
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:40.040]  war camp he was so physically and psychologically damaged by that that they put him in a hospital
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.840]  and this is what our government did to this fellow who fought for them when he came back
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:49.800]  you talk about betrayal about a world war two vets about captain america
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.080]  that type of thing and we're going to talk about the super soldier thing coming up here but
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:59.560]  they gave him electroshock therapy that sometimes caused convulsions so bad that it broke patients
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:05.960]  bones then to stimulate patients nerves hospital staff also commonly sprayed veterans with powerful
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:12.920]  jets of alternating hot and cold water show the archives this particular fellow mr tritz
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:18.840]  got 66 treatments of high-pressure water sprays that they called the scotch douche
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:27.320]  and the needle shower his medical records show that now that's what they did to veterans back
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:32.440]  then and of course this is a they also have story of many many veterans and things that happened to
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:39.400]  them what are they doing today well today they're giving them ssri drugs and the ssri drugs do the
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:44.920]  same thing to veterans that they do to people who are not in the military they make them suicidal
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:50.600]  they exacerbate in many cases the medical conditions that they're trying to treat they make people
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:55.480]  suicidal they make them homicidal they have them sleepwalking where they don't know what they're
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:17:03.080]  doing they take actions that they are not aware of where are we going with this well obama has
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:08.440]  just doubled down on funding for something they call the brain initiative now the government
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:12.600]  always loves to do these acronyms they they come up with the acronym and then they fill it in you
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:18.360]  know if you don't like the government they accuse you of being odd odd that's oppositional defiant
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:25.720]  disorder well in this particular case brain stands for brain research through advancing
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:31.800]  innovative neuro technologies so that's their b-r-a-i-n and what they are planning to do is to
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:38.680]  develop with DARPA and the national institute of health a toolbox of technologies to map the
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:43.240]  brain's circuitry to measure activity in brain circuits to probe how these circuits lead to
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:49.240]  unique human cognition and behavior now of course DARPA has said that they want to use this as a way
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:58.440]  to treat PTSD they believe that they can go in and selectively delete memories that they can go in
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:03.960]  and give you memories that did not previously exist and this is the stuff that we have seen
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:10.120]  before in science fiction isn't it philip k dicks total recall where they give people memories that
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:15.240]  they didn't have before playing with people's comprehension of reality playing with their
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:21.000]  memories if they're going to do this in a benevolent way to soldiers could not they
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:28.680]  do it in a malevolent way to dissidents to also the soldiers themselves maybe giving them a memory
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:35.720]  of shooting a summit bin laden that they really didn't happen or whatever it's a very troubling
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:39.160]  thing to see the government doing this and it's a very troubling thing to see DARPA involved in
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:43.800]  this DARPA is always as we pointed out as we're talking about before when we're talking about
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:50.360]  captain america it seems like they are always involved in the worst in the darkest ways of
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:56.360]  applying technology all technology is is a tool and like any tool it can be used in a good way
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:59.880]  or it can be used in a bad way you can take a hammer and you can use it to drive a nail into a
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:05.400]  board or you can take a hammer and you can kill people with it DARPA takes the hammers and they
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:10.760]  hit people in the head with it that's what they are about and that's what we're seeing the funding
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:17.240]  is being doubled down on that and it's it's a very disturbing thing to to see them moving in that
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:22.680]  direction but there's an even more disturbing story about DARPA this is one that we linked to on
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:29.000]  info wars yesterday it's actually a story from a place called i o nine and they talk about DARPA's
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:36.840]  new biotech division wants to create a transhuman future i'm going to have to return with that right
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:42.280]  after the break but you know we've talked about how frightening these robots that we see DARPA
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:49.400]  developing are we see them developing robots that can run faster than humans and we see them
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:55.880]  developing robots that can do things with superhuman strength but they're looking to create
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:20:01.000]  flesh and blood robots that's the most disturbing thing we're going to have that information right
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:06.040]  after the break how can you save a ton of money and prepare for emergencies by having your own
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:11.320]  in-home freeze dryer from harvest right now you can cut down on wasted food by freeze drying your

[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:18.280]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:24.440]  encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:31.080]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously

[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:20.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night i'll be your host today but we're going
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:26.280]  to be joined at the bottom of the hour with alex jones's special report on climate change so
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:31.560]  stay tuned don't miss that now just before the break we were talking about the sad history
[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:38.120]  of the american va association of the veterans administration and the way they treated returning
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:44.200]  world war two vets giving many of the ones who had the the greatest problems giving them
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:50.360]  shock treatment violent shock treatment hitting them with hot and cold jets of water and then
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:58.040]  ultimately giving them lobotomies what are they doing today they're doing that in a much more subtle
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:04.920]  much more high tech way they're doing it with ssri drugs and they're doing that to a lot of people
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:12.520]  in society and so we should look very carefully at future treatments that they're planning and
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:18.440]  of course darpa is looking to as they say they're doing brain research because they just want to
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:24.360]  help us they just want to help soldiers who have ptsd and so they're going to selectively be able
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:30.920]  to remove memories or to implant new memories of things that you never did that's what darpa is
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:35.320]  trying to do and they're trying to do a lot besides that we've reported and and we just
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:40.280]  showed you a picture up there if you're watching a picture of the robots that being developed by
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:44.680]  darpa and of course when they develop these robots they say well this is all so that we can use them
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:49.960]  to help in the fukushima disaster well if they're so concerned about the fukushima disaster then
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:54.680]  maybe the defense department shouldn't have sent the soldiers the sailors on the uss reagan
[02:25:55.400 --> 02:26:00.760]  into dangerous territory and left them there for a couple of days there's a mass of soldiers just a
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:06.920]  i guess it's been three years now that are coming down with cancer already because of
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:13.800]  that treatment but of course the robots are not there to attack you it's not part of some new kind
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:20.440]  of real world realization of terminator no they're there to protect us all from fukushima
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:26.280]  and the new super soldiers that they're creating and the brain projects where they want to remove
[02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:30.840]  some memories and selectively implant others that's not going to be used against dissidents
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:34.840]  that's not going to be used against the general population that's just to help some selected
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:41.320]  soldiers who have to who are struggling with ptsd and of course there is a massive brain
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:46.360]  research project that's being conducted uh internationally and just in the us it's called
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:52.440]  the brain initiative and obama just doubled the funding for that but as we were going to break i
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:58.280]  was just starting to talk about this article that was linked on info wars darpa's new biotech
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:04.600]  division wants to create a transhuman future yes that's right you think the super soldier program
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:12.520]  in captain america is science fiction it is much much worse than that now what they're talking
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:18.520]  about is basically making human robots that's where it's all headed but they point out they've
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:22.920]  had a nice spin on it in this report because this is kind of uh the people who wrote this even though
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:29.640]  they're giving you a lot of links a lot of data it's really kind of more of a sci-fi website more
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:35.000]  of a popular science type of website they're not going to question the ethics of what could be done
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.400]  and that's what's really the problem so often we have scientists who do not question the ethics
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:47.320]  of what they're going to be doing we see a lot of movie themes where you have soldiers who were
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:55.640]  or or uh police officers who were brought into some kind of a um uh criminal or operation
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:58.840]  that the government is doing or the criminal elements within the government are doing and
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:05.640]  they don't aren't really fully aware of how they're being used or you have stories that talk about
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:10.440]  the false narratives that got us into the iraq war and how soldiers there were just trying to do the
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:16.440]  right thing they didn't realize how they're being used but we have only had as far as i know
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:21.400]  recently there's only been one movie is one of the born movies where you actually had a scientist
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:26.840]  kind of back off and question for a moment what they were doing if you remember there was a scene
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:33.320]  where as uh it was in the last uh born movie uh he's on the run and he's got the scientist who
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:40.280]  is part of the mental research again it was a brain program and he asks her about what the
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:43.880]  research that she was involved in and and she gets real excited talking about the technical
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:49.080]  details because it's really kind of an intellectual puzzle for her that she likes to solve and then
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:55.800]  he's he gradually brings her to the realization of the ethical consequences of what she's doing
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:59.800]  so many times scientists don't look at that but let's look at what they're actually talking about
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:03.960]  doing just apart from the ethics here it says that they're going to be dealing with everything
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:07.880]  from stopping plagues to building synthetic soldiers well that's what they would like us to
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:13.960]  think says darpa has been busy exploring the increasingly dynamic intersection of biology
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:19.480]  and physical sciences that's a quote from darpa i guess you could say they're going to boldly go
[02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:26.760]  where no one with ethics would would want to go and uh then they talk next about the transhuman
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:32.440]  soldier advanced prosthetics featuring mind controlled limbs neural interfaces the ability
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:37.880]  to survive blood loss and then we get into some other things and we're running out of time right
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:42.440]  now we're going to be right back with that and with alex's special report on climate change stay
[02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:56.360]  tuned we'll be right back we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:10.520]  the flavoring but we already know so enjoy the flavors we're going to get the real solution which
[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:15.560]  is going to be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes i'm consistently pro-death
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:20.600]  i'm for assisted suicide i'm for regular zoas and i'm for whatever gets the freeway moving
[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:24.360]  is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:31.720]  would it be better not to lay off the those ten teachers and to make that trade up in medical
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:36.360]  costs but that's called the death panel uh and you're not supposed to have that discussion
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:42.840]  they told me to uh to say that they were sorry but that you had become unreliable
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:55.480]  is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that would do this to its
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:35:01.880]  children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to its descendants that kind of society
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:07.480]  will also eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the quizlings and
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:14.600]  the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a suicide cult the scoops are on their
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:22.840]  way the scoops are on their way i repeat the scoops are on their way you will find out why
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:33.800]  soylent green means life you will find out why soylent green means death we gotta stop them come on
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:45.400]  next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food you gotta tell them
[02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:52.520]  that's right you gotta tell them and as we just saw there when you remove the ethical constraints
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.720]  what is the government capable of doing what is society capable of doing well
[02:35:57.720 --> 02:36:02.760]  there apparently are very little if any ethical constraints in our society so let's take a look
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:07.720]  at the technical constraints and see what these people who are devoid of any ethics are doing
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:12.360]  to get around their technical constraints i kept getting sidetracked in the previous uh segment
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:18.680]  and try and talk about this transhumanist future soldier that DARPA is trying to create let me
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:24.600]  avoid talking about the ethics for a moment and just lay out the raw data that is documented here
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:31.000]  in this article about what DARPA is trying to do they've got a biocrinicity program where they
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:36.040]  want to get a handle on the human metabolism and on aging yeah that's the time and aging that
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:42.920]  sort of thing resulting in an enhanced human combat performance and a freakishly resilient soldier
[02:36:42.920 --> 02:36:48.200]  both in terms of resisting and recovering from physical injury and resistance to disease they
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:53.640]  also want to seek out and create new life according to this article the pentagon also wants to
[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:59.480]  dabble in artificial life that's right creating chimeras things that are mixtures of different
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:06.920]  creatures even things that have never existed in any form in any shape once refined this biotechnology
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:11.800]  will allow for the creation of entirely new organisms while adding new capacities or quote
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:16.680]  unquote features to existing ones including humans imagine a soldier who never needs to sleep
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:24.600]  who requires minimal sustenance or who has cat-like infrared vision a new study suggests that dogs
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.720]  and cats can see things that are invisible to humans from psychedelic stripes on flowers to
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:37.080]  flashy patterned feathers so why not give humans that kind of capability interestingly this meshes
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:43.240]  well with DARPA's existing bio design program he points out and they have a quote here why bother
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:49.480]  with mechanical robots when you can engineer fake human replicants to fight your battles we haven't
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:55.320]  heard much about pentagons would be synthetic soldiers but the bio design program got a bump
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:38:01.640]  from 11.4 to 19.3 million dollars in next year's budget but of course that's a small amount of
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:05.480]  money compared to the amount of money that they're spending on the brain program and for those of you
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:08.920]  who might look at that and say hey that's cool i would love to be able to see in the dark like a
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:14.840]  cat well guess what they're not going to put out a super soldier like captain america's we talked
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:20.200]  about when we talked about the movie with the info wars crew the guy who was a scientist there was
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:25.800]  very concerned that they had the right kind of person the right kind of moral foundation
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:31.080]  in that person before he gave him those kinds of powers they're not looking for that they're
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:35.720]  looking for just the opposite as a matter of fact if you happen to have moral foundations that's not
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:42.280]  going to be a problem for DARPA because their key thing is to adjust and control your brain
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:48.200]  so if they can give you physical capability you can bet that they're going to do something to
[02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:53.400]  control your brain if you accept that physical capability you're going to be accepting that
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:59.240]  brain control as well now i've been promising that alex is going to give us a special report on
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:16.680]  climate change and we've got that report here it is across the northern hemisphere in 2013 and early
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:24.760]  2014 we have seen record low temperatures some of them the coldest temperatures ever recorded
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:31.720]  in the last 300 years since thermometers were invented the great lakes entirely froze over
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:39.640]  the arctic and Antarctic in their respective winters saw record growth in the ice but what
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:47.880]  does al gore and cnn and msnbc and the un and the bbc do they show you weathered satellites from the
[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:55.240]  poles during the summers and show the ice shrinking as it's always done for thousands of years with
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:03.240]  the northern and southern passages that were even documented in the time of the vikings they lie to
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:08.920]  people and say that penguins cannot swim in the Antarctic and that in the arctic polar bears are
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:15.320]  dying even though national geographic has to admit polar bear numbers are up five fold since the
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:22.280]  1950s and are now invading areas not previously known to be in their range but that doesn't matter
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:27.240]  obama said you could keep your doctor then he said he never said you could keep your doctor if you've
[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:32.360]  got health care already then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it if you like the
[02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:37.480]  plan you have you can keep it i intend to keep this promise if you like your health care plan
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:42.360]  you'll be able to keep your health care plan you like your plan and your doctor you can keep them
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:47.560]  he said it wouldn't raise your premium even though it did so why not tell you that polar bears can't
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:53.560]  swim why not tell school kids they're all going to die if we don't pay al gore and the un trillions
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:59.640]  of dollars in carbon taxes well now because they're losing the debate and it's been shown in the un's
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:03.960]  own numbers that since the mid 90s the earth temperature has actually dropped slightly that
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:10.920]  there are natural cycles they can't deal with those facts so all over british and european news but
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:17.560]  also here in the us we've seen professors and others come out and call for the arrest of people
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:24.360]  that question anthropogenic or man-made global warming and the latest is in the times of london
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:31.160]  with a straight face one of the biggest papers in england talks about ministers and the committee
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:37.400]  in parliament calling for people to not be allowed including members of government
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:47.240]  to question the quote consensus that man-made global warming is not man-made well there is no
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:54.840]  consensus in fact the facade of the consensus is collapsing the consensus is forming that the only
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:42:00.760]  thing that's steady is change itself if you want to see the article the headline is cracked down
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:07.000]  ordered on climate change skeptics that sounds like something out of the old soviet union then
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:15.800]  we segue into al gore and his new move to produce an inconvenient truth part two with new lies for
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:23.320]  old bottom line we have an authoritarian movement on the so-called left that is seeking to not just
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:31.000]  tax every form of human activity and track it but to also silence anyone that would dare challenge
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:36.680]  it these people are not liberals they are out of control authoritarians but i wanted to reach
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:41.960]  out to some of the mainline supporters of this who really mean well and i want to discuss some
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:49.480]  of the real environmental threats of this planet open air genetic engineering of plants for pharmacological
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:55.880]  crops where viruses and bacteria are mixed into the genetic code of mainline staple food crops that
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:03.320]  then infect the entire family of say corn or canola has been proven in major studies to cross the
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:09.800]  genetic line into animals and humans that eat it damaging our dna we know that toxic waste
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:15.480]  dumping is a serious problem we know that overfishing in many areas is a serious issue we know that
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:21.560]  the development of superbugs because of the overuse of antibiotics is threatening not just human life
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:27.240]  but much of animal life on this planet but when you enter into the equation earth changes and
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:35.240]  giant asteroids a two mile across nickel asteroid would be estimated to be the equivalent of
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:41.400]  thousands of herishimas or nakasakis and that's something that humans don't have control over
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:48.360]  that's something that paying a tax to al gore will not fix then you enter volcanic and seismic
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:54.760]  activity huge earthquakes from chili to off the coast of japan in the last few weeks as well as
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:44:01.160]  california as the pacific rim heats up but government scientists tell us don't worry in the
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:06.920]  geological record big events like this only happen every few hundred thousand years and we
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:13.800]  don't think we're due they have no idea on the real geological line how often these events
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:19.720]  really happen but what we know is many civilizations have been destroyed or damaged by them we know
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:25.880]  the world is hit by huge earthquakes and tsunamis on a routine basis causing tens of thousands to
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:32.600]  die every single year but because these are threats that the government can't even pretend to control
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:38.360]  they tell us it's no big deal it's not an issue i go back to this all the time honeybees kill more
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:45.480]  than 200 people a year in the u.s alone more than international terrorism combined but we're not
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:50.760]  seeing homeland security checkpoints out on the road to stop honeybees because it's something that
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:57.720]  we know is just a risk in the environment inherently just like earthquakes just like tsunamis what do
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:03.560]  you do to mitigate against earthquakes and tsunamis you don't live in those zones or you live in a
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:09.880]  home that is designed to mitigate the danger from living in those zones the truth is the greatest
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:15.480]  danger historically is government in the 20th century according to the university of hawaii
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:25.720]  262 million innocents non-military personnel were killed by government were executed were murdered
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:31.800]  in many cases raped and tortured before they were killed statistically it's not earthquakes
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:39.080]  it's not asteroids it's not flesh-eating bacteria it's not cigarettes it's not firearms it's not
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:43.880]  honeybees it's not great white sharks that are the danger that kill five people a year but everybody's
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:50.680]  scared of them no ladies and gentlemen it's government taken over by out of control criminal
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:56.200]  interest and when government start trying to say we're not going to let you be pro-second amendment
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:46:01.480]  or we're not going to let you promote your views on climate and the fact that the earth is always
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:06.440]  going through changes we're going to shut you up we're not going to let television have you
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:11.880]  want as guests that's what they're proposing you know you're dealing with the real threat
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:17.240]  that has reared its head throughout history it's called despotism it's called depression it's called
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:23.560]  tyranny and across the world it's on the march but for every action there's an equal and opposite
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:30.600]  reaction to quote sir Isaac Newton and there is a response a sleeping giant of free humanity that
[02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:37.320]  is awakening and beginning to move against the tyranny the future the destiny of civilization
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:45.720]  and freedom is in your hands alex jones signing off for info wars dot com now back to david night
[02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:52.920]  and the worldwide radio transmission on this friday edition we'll be back this sunday live as well
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:47:03.320]  with more live reports and special commentary that's exactly right as alex is pointing out
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:08.040]  they're going to try to censor people that they don't agree with but we also see that they do
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:14.440]  other things they also create fake social media outlets there was a stir this week as we learned
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:18.920]  that the u.s. government was creating a fake cuban twitter account we have a report from lienne
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:22.840]  macadoo that aired on the nightly news last night but remember that they have two ways that they do
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:28.120]  this we just saw in turkey how they would shut down twitter how they would shut down youtube
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:33.720]  because there was a video on youtube about a false flag attack being planned by the highest levels
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:39.000]  of the turkish civilian government the government there as well as the intelligence commission and
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:43.080]  the military they were all planning to do a false flag so they could start a war with syria so what
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:48.280]  they do they shut down youtube to the entire country but they can also do the opposite they
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:53.000]  can also as we've seen many times in the past with voice of america radio free europe and now
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:57.880]  with the cuban twitter account they can use information in their syop or here's that report
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:11.400]  from lienne macadoo from the nightly news last night the u.s. government created a secret social
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:16.680]  media platform aimed at taking down cuba's communist government with the recent introduction
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:22.120]  of cell phone use in cuba u.s. officials saw the perfect opportunity to reach hundreds of thousands
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:28.280]  on the island the plan was to launch a cuban twitter using cell phone text messaging to evade cuba's
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:33.000]  strict control of information and internet regulation initially users would receive
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:39.720]  non-controversial content like news messages on soccer games or music and hurricane updates later
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:44.520]  when the network reached a critical mass of subscribers operators would introduce political
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:50.760]  content aimed at inspiring cubans to organize smart mobs mass gatherings called at a moment's
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:56.840]  notice that might trigger a cuban spring this was incredibly dangerous for the some 40 000 young
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:01.560]  cubans who were interacting with the platform they had no idea that the messages they thought
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:07.560]  were uninfluenced by their government were in fact financed by the u.s. government and influenced
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:13.800]  by its agenda social media platforms like twitter have aided uprisings in several countries and in
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:20.040]  2011 hillary clinton admitted the u.s. helped people in oppressive internet environments
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:25.560]  get around filters there's no telling how many of these uprisings have been financed and influenced
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:31.000]  by the u.s. government but while the u.s. government admits that social media is a powerful tool in
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:36.520]  taking down regimes overseas it wouldn't like to see technology having that same effect here in
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:42.280]  america that's why every year we're seeing legislation like sopa syspa and pipa as well as
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:47.960]  the executive order signed by obama that gives him the authority to shut down the internet
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:53.480]  instruments to fight the enemy abroad are now being used as tools of tyranny here in america
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:59.160]  tanks used for war are now being brought to our streets urban warfare training has increased at
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:04.680]  home and we are being openly propagandized to thanks to last year's reform of the smith month
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:10.200]  act the lifting of the propaganda ban will now allow a vast ocean of programming by voice of
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:16.040]  america radio free europe and other media which is now heard in over a hundred countries to be
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:23.320]  heard here at home as well talk radio is and was the original alternative media when print was
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:30.120]  controlled when the tv was controlled only three channels it was talk radio where people could call
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:34.680]  in and talk about things and so many stories would break regionally that would end up becoming
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:38.520]  you know very important and it was the place that could change what was happening legislatively
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:44.520]  government tyrants and government have always feared talk radio and everything they can to kill
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:51.240]  it now and in response to a government losing the info war nsa champion mike rogers will be coming

[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:20.200]  now in that last segment you heard leon macadoo's special report about the fake cuban twitter account
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:25.480]  that was set up by the american government today we have a reaction to that but before i go to that
[02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:30.440]  let me let me point out that if you're a prison planet tv member that not only helped to support
[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:35.320]  our operation helps to pay salaries for people like leon myself jacari and others all the support
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:40.840]  staff it also is a way that you can help wake people up friends and family you can share that
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:48.200]  with up to 10 other people can watch at the same time and of course at prison planet tv all of alex
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:53.880]  jones's excellent documentaries are there another great way to wake people up but we condensed the
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:59.720]  news down into a very fast-paced 30 minute program with special reports and updates and of course
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:04.200]  yesterday the thing that was breaking that leon reported on was this fake cuban twitter accounts
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:09.400]  one of the articles that we covered last night a fake psi op operation against the government of
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:15.720]  cuba but it gives us insight into what the american government is doing and is as leon pointed out
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:22.360]  the instruments of fighting your enemies abroad tend to come back and be used against you as
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:28.360]  instruments of tyranny at home and of course we are seeing that in spades now especially
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:33.720]  in the psi op war in the information war but listen to this reaction from the white house
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:38.040]  trying to defend this first of all the reaction of a couple of senior democrats and the congressional
[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:42.920]  intelligence and judiciary committees they said they had known nothing about the effort i know
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:47.160]  nothing i'm not involved with that distance themselves from it they described it as dumb
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:54.600]  dumb dumb yeah it was dumb but because it got exposed okay this is one of the things that was
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:56:00.280]  in a memo that got uncovered this was a memo from mobile accord incorporated one of the
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:04.920]  project's creators they said there will be absolutely no mention of the united states
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:11.000]  government's involvement and this is absolutely crucial for the long-term success of the service
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:18.360]  and to ensure the success of the mission so it was a covert psi op mission to get people roped into
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:23.800]  a social media network and then use that social media network to try to change public opinion
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:31.320]  where have we heard that before that'd be like facebook or google or so many other outlets on
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:35.480]  the internet the internet i think was initially designed by that by the same people we've been
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:42.120]  talking about creating a biotech transhuman future soldier darpa you know they started the internet
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:49.960]  but we can take those weapons and use them against them this is one of the things that that came up
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:56.760]  in this was they were talking to they have us aid's top official rajiv Shah is scheduled to
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:57:01.960]  testify on tuesday before the senate appropriations committee now where have you heard us aid before
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:08.840]  well that's the corporation that is often the front group for the cia that's the corporation
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:14.040]  that obama's mother worked for if you remember that's what she was doing when they were out of
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:19.560]  the country where he grew up out of the country a very disturbing thing to see here but again
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:23.000]  it's more of the same as we see and of course they're saying that the republican chairman of
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.680]  the house oversight committee said he too would like to look into the program come on don't tell
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:31.640]  me that mike rogers didn't know all about this he's just not going to dump on these people because
[02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:36.760]  he is such a quisling for the security state and it's another reason why i think he's moving to
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:41.960]  talk radio is because i don't think he could get elected dog catcher i think we could get people
[02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:47.640]  on the left and the right to chip together to keep mike rogers out if he had decided to run but he
[02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:52.520]  is heading for the hills because they don't want to wind up with egg on their face and talking about
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:57.400]  bridging the differences between the left and the right here we see something from the aclu dot org
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:03.560]  have we become a surveillance state a five-part test and here's the five questions they have
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:07.800]  capacity to what extent have we reached the point where we're technologically capable of building a
[02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:13.160]  total surveillance state number two infrastructure to what extent have we created an infrastructure
[02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:17.800]  for the mass surveillance state we're at a time but i tell you what the answer to that is yes we do
[02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:23.320]  have a police state we had william benny one of the top whistleblowers ever from the nsa he had
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:29.560]  technical responsibilities that were global and he said we have arrived at the police state well
[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:43.640]  that's it for today we're going to be back on sunday at four p.m. central ipm eastern join us then
