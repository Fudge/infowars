[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  incredible as well I remember seeing Homeland Security had Ridge what seven
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  years ago say that they would have basically the same type of checkpoints
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  in shopping malls trains buses and on highways that they have in airports
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  that's just there to train you to submit to tyranny and here it is out of NBC

[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  Philadelphia you know headline out of NBC not not Alex Jones and the police are
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  quoted as saying we can do anything we want we can strip search you we can do

[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  conservatives anti-war activist basically anybody that isn't controlled by the
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  false left-right two-party system so the domestic gestapo now being publicly
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  announced and a federal court has ruled that citizens can be secretly arrested
[02:33.000 --> 02:41.000]  tortured disappeared so 100% official Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  announcements being made now let's see them try to actually carry it out but
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  this is a rogue criminal government run by private corporations that have
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  already stolen tens of trillions of dollars in the last two years and they're
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  just getting started so all of that is coming up and dealing with the economy
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  a lot of really important news on that front it's now begun there are now

[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  institutions are refusing to buy them so the federal reserve is having to buy

[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  jobs having their pay being cut their underemployed unemployment of course
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  is surging and that's even with the government's cooked numbers that they're

[08:37.840 --> 08:41.680]  But in this first hour, Patrice O'Neill is in studio with us.
[08:41.680 --> 08:45.320]  He's a very successful stand-up comedian, radio personality and actor.
[08:45.320 --> 08:49.520]  He's been on a number of comedy specials, Showtime HBO Comedy Central Presents, in addition
[08:49.520 --> 08:53.840]  to guest appearance and television shows, which is a late-night with David Letterman.
[08:53.840 --> 08:58.720]  And on and on, Ellen DeGeneres' show, The Office, his stand-up comedy focuses on topics
[08:58.720 --> 09:03.720]  such as American politics, race and race relations, sexuality and censorship.
[09:03.720 --> 09:07.600]  He is also a regular visitor of the opening and Anthony program on XM radio.
[09:07.600 --> 09:12.560]  Patrice is currently on tour and will be performing this Friday and Saturday night here in Austin,
[09:12.560 --> 09:16.120]  Texas, where we're based at the Cap City Comedy Club.
[09:16.120 --> 09:20.080]  So if it isn't already sold out, you can probably get down there and see him tonight
[09:20.080 --> 09:21.080]  and tomorrow.
[09:21.080 --> 09:22.960]  Patrice O'Neill, good to have you here in studio with us.
[09:22.960 --> 09:23.960]  Thank you, sir.
[09:23.960 --> 09:24.960]  How you doing, man?
[09:24.960 --> 09:25.960]  It's awesome.
[09:25.960 --> 09:26.960]  It's good to have you here.
[09:26.960 --> 09:31.200]  I mean, I had seen you on television a few times before, but then I had seen some clips
[09:31.200 --> 09:34.560]  and heard some clips of you on the opening and Anthony show that reaches millions and
[09:34.560 --> 09:35.560]  millions of people.
[09:35.560 --> 09:40.000]  And you were very early on, right, when the Obama deception came out, when Obama was still
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  like God, you were saying people need to see this Obama deception and you were saying,
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.280]  you were saying, hey, you know, this shatters the left-right paradigm.
[09:47.280 --> 09:50.840]  They were saying, what, Patrice, you support Bush?
[09:50.840 --> 09:56.160]  Look, you can't, I think, I think there's an instinct to people who believe in newer
[09:56.160 --> 09:58.800]  order and globalization is an instinct.
[09:58.800 --> 10:00.960]  You don't have to be informed to have that instinct.
[10:00.960 --> 10:07.600]  It's like when I first saw, after the family came out, I had a heartwarming feeling just
[10:07.600 --> 10:12.120]  to see the black family come out and you go, wow, man, I'm alive to see that.
[10:12.120 --> 10:17.960]  But then they see the faces and you see these faces and you go, there you go, man, something's
[10:17.960 --> 10:18.960]  wrong.
[10:18.960 --> 10:23.640]  Like you just have an instinct, like, why am I not as happy as I should be right now?
[10:23.640 --> 10:26.160]  That's the new world order instinct.
[10:26.160 --> 10:28.320]  Then you go and you find certain things out.
[10:28.320 --> 10:37.580]  So I was actually, I think I was on like 50cent.com, this is 50.
[10:37.580 --> 10:45.160]  So you had the Obama deception thing right there as I'm watching something on 50.
[10:45.160 --> 10:52.440]  And I looked at it, man, and I'm like, I'm like, I can't be an honest human being if
[10:52.440 --> 10:56.160]  I don't feel like this is touching on something.
[10:56.160 --> 11:04.400]  And I had the instinct of all of that, but that particular film opened me up to the whole
[11:04.400 --> 11:05.400]  thing.
[11:05.400 --> 11:10.480]  And the one thing, if I have to pick out one thing that got me and got me going was the
[11:10.480 --> 11:15.320]  fact that the Federal Reserve Bank is private owned company.
[11:15.320 --> 11:19.400]  That on the lowest levels, I have never gotten past that.
[11:19.400 --> 11:26.840]  If you go, it is the eugenics and the globalization and all of this stuff and everything that
[11:26.840 --> 11:33.000]  got me going and keeps my mind in that direction is that the Federal Reserve is a private owned
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  company.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.160]  It's not my 50 cent link to the movie, maybe he's away.
[11:37.160 --> 11:47.480]  This is 50.com is where I saw the link to the Obama deception and it brought me in a
[11:47.480 --> 11:48.480]  direction that
[11:48.480 --> 11:52.280]  It's got KRS-1 and of course, Professor Griffith.
[11:52.280 --> 11:53.680]  Professor Griffith is in that.
[11:53.680 --> 12:00.880]  And KRS has always been into that, but the thing is I noticed something about it.
[12:00.880 --> 12:08.120]  I'm a comedian, when I first got into it, heavy, heavy, heavy, you stop being funny.
[12:08.120 --> 12:09.120]  You really do.
[12:09.120 --> 12:10.960]  You just, nothing's funny.
[12:10.960 --> 12:15.720]  So I had to kind of chill out for a second and figure out how to be funny, back being
[12:15.720 --> 12:21.160]  funny again, and then still throwing it out to people because at the level you are, you
[12:21.160 --> 12:25.160]  know, I watched the website and watched all the films.
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.200]  At the level you're at, it scares the death out of the average person who even might be
[12:29.200 --> 12:32.200]  eugenics is the highest level.
[12:32.200 --> 12:33.200]  Well, exactly.
[12:33.200 --> 12:34.560]  That's what happens to me.
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.640]  I'm working all the time and so I'm usually not freaked out or scared, but then when I
[12:39.640 --> 12:44.480]  take off a few days or get away from the radio or don't, you know, read the news, driving
[12:44.480 --> 12:49.400]  into work this morning, I was, I would even call it scared, just more freaked out, realizing
[12:49.400 --> 12:50.400]  this is real.
[12:50.400 --> 12:56.720]  I mean, I was on the airplane flying back from New Orleans yesterday from doing an investigation
[12:56.720 --> 13:00.680]  and shoot with Jesse Ventura and I was asked by a man on the plane next to me and a woman
[13:00.680 --> 13:05.480]  next to me, both separately were listeners and they said, is this real for you or is
[13:05.480 --> 13:06.480]  this entertainment?
[13:06.480 --> 13:09.360]  I said, well, wait a minute, everything we talk about is on the record.
[13:09.360 --> 13:10.920]  Of course this is real.
[13:10.920 --> 13:16.440]  Of course this is real, but getting back to eugenics, now I saw them build up Obama as
[13:16.440 --> 13:19.000]  our savior and they were going to try to push their agenda.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.800]  They took a step with their left foot.
[13:20.800 --> 13:24.080]  Now they're getting ready with the right wing and, and, and Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin
[13:24.080 --> 13:26.200]  to take a step with their right foot.
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.040]  And so now I was called a communist when I didn't like Bush.
[13:30.040 --> 13:32.880]  Now I've been called a right winger because I don't like Obama and now I'm getting ready
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.760]  to be called a commie again because now I've got to swing my guns over onto Glenn Beck
[13:37.760 --> 13:38.760]  and Sarah Palin.
[13:38.760 --> 13:43.960]  But I don't think, I think the plan was not, I think Obama was supposed to be in office
[13:43.960 --> 13:45.080]  for eight years.
[13:45.080 --> 13:51.200]  I think the thing that destroyed the Obama plan, I think is racism.
[13:51.200 --> 13:57.280]  I think white people's, the average white person who was not into the new world, just
[13:57.280 --> 14:02.880]  regular politics, I think they just couldn't, they can't take having a black boss for eight
[14:02.880 --> 14:03.880]  years.
[14:03.880 --> 14:10.880]  And I think that that ruined the, the, the higher ups plan to have him kind of have this,
[14:10.880 --> 14:14.320]  this, this feel of warm, we're all together.
[14:14.320 --> 14:15.480]  Yeah, there's feel good.
[14:15.480 --> 14:19.720]  And then I don't think, I think the average, like, I don't even know who to say the average
[14:19.720 --> 14:23.520]  white person, but you know, people who are starting tea parties and, and, and starting
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.200]  these things, these things that's from 1712, I think, I mean, look, I'm not stupid.
[14:29.200 --> 14:30.200]  You know what I mean?
[14:30.200 --> 14:36.080]  It's like, don't lie to me about it not being racial when you start a tea party and you
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.320]  out of nowhere, out of, it's a two year movement out of nowhere.
[14:40.320 --> 14:44.880]  When the president's black, if, if, if we're into like, if you're in the new world order,
[14:44.880 --> 14:48.560]  this is, it don't matter, black, white, that, that's why it's like, if you're into that,
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.080]  they just go, you don't care what color the president is because it's, it's all foul.
[14:53.080 --> 14:58.880]  But the average person who's just in the Republican and Democrats, I think there's a, there's
[14:58.880 --> 15:06.680]  a racial element to this country that couldn't, can't take another four years of, of, of Obama.
[15:06.680 --> 15:07.680]  It's just not going to happen.
[15:07.680 --> 15:13.000]  Well, I think what added to that too, though, is the government run healthcare and all these
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.760]  other big moves, but I do think that is an element to it.
[15:15.760 --> 15:18.560]  The average person knows, Alex, that's what I'm saying.
[15:18.560 --> 15:23.600]  I'm, I'm out here and, and, and I believe in the Bilderbergs.
[15:23.600 --> 15:26.240]  I believe in the Bohemian Grove.
[15:26.240 --> 15:33.240]  I believe, I believe it all, but the problem is, I look at, and don't take this wrong.
[15:33.240 --> 15:37.480]  If, if any, you know, listeners, I look at Hitler, okay.
[15:37.480 --> 15:43.960]  And, and I go, why do, if I'm a crazy guy and I go, I hate Jews, I want them all dead.
[15:43.960 --> 15:50.600]  Do you blame me as much as you blame the 50,000 people that I convince to shoot Jews in the
[15:50.600 --> 15:52.520]  head in the middle of the street?
[15:52.520 --> 15:57.560]  I don't like the people that go, okay, I'll, I'll just shoot people in the head.
[15:57.560 --> 16:06.320]  I've run into so many people who are willing to kill other people or kill themselves really.
[16:06.320 --> 16:12.120]  They don't even know they're killing themselves on behalf of these, these, the, the, the Illuminati,
[16:12.120 --> 16:16.480]  the CFR, the, these, these people who we look at it like they're evil.
[16:16.480 --> 16:20.680]  Yeah, we get there evil, but you can't, don't help them.
[16:20.680 --> 16:23.640]  Don't help cut my head off and cut your head off.
[16:23.640 --> 16:24.640]  No, that's a good point.
[16:24.640 --> 16:27.680]  You know, the Night Circuit Court of Appeals is now ruled.
[16:27.680 --> 16:29.640]  Citizens can be secretly arrested.
[16:29.640 --> 16:30.880]  People can be tortured.
[16:30.880 --> 16:32.600]  They don't need warrants.
[16:32.600 --> 16:36.120]  And this is all for the American people, regardless of what color you are.
[16:36.120 --> 16:37.120]  Right.
[16:37.120 --> 16:41.240]  But just like with Hitler, he sold it with an unpopular minority first, but really it
[16:41.240 --> 16:42.400]  was for everybody.
[16:42.400 --> 16:46.600]  So these idiots that go along with this, they need to know that they're in the crosshairs
[16:46.600 --> 16:47.600]  as well.
[16:47.600 --> 16:48.600]  They just go along.
[16:48.600 --> 16:52.640]  I, I, I pay my electric bill every three, four months.
[16:52.640 --> 16:54.200]  I pay it when I get a threatening letter.
[16:54.200 --> 16:58.760]  I just forget this time around, somebody came to my house to cut it off and he goes, look,
[16:58.760 --> 17:02.000]  you're going to give me a, give me a check or I'm going to cut your electricity off.
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.680]  I go, look, man, I'm going to pay it online or whatever.
[17:04.680 --> 17:06.120]  He's like, look, this is my job.
[17:06.120 --> 17:07.120]  I'm going to cut it off.
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.040]  I go, what if I had somebody in here who could die without the electricity?
[17:11.040 --> 17:12.160]  You know what I mean?
[17:12.160 --> 17:13.600]  And he just did this.
[17:13.600 --> 17:15.840]  He just went, uh, that's my job.
[17:15.840 --> 17:22.200]  I go, your job is to, you think that you love your family by killing my family.
[17:22.200 --> 17:26.240]  Like meaning I could, something could be happening, nothing is, but I'm just on a dramatic level
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.360]  because then I got on the phone and the woman said, well, if your kid was on a respirator,
[17:30.360 --> 17:34.080]  we would tell you, you should have thought of that before you didn't pay your bill.
[17:34.080 --> 17:35.560]  And I go, are you serious?
[17:35.560 --> 17:36.560]  My bill was $800.
[17:36.560 --> 17:41.000]  Do you think people got $800 just to pay you think everybody's trying to scam you?
[17:41.000 --> 17:46.400]  Your job is to hear me beg for my life and you go, sorry, sir.
[17:46.400 --> 17:50.720]  So do you think that you could go home and love your family the way you think you love
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.720]  them?
[17:51.720 --> 17:52.720]  If you could kill my family.
[17:52.720 --> 17:53.800]  Patrice, that's the key point you made.
[17:53.800 --> 17:58.040]  You're talking about the Nuremberg defense where these tens of thousands of Nazis said,
[17:58.040 --> 18:02.680]  hey, I was just following orders and the court ruled no, if you're doing something immoral
[18:02.680 --> 18:06.920]  or murderous or illegal, it doesn't matter of a tyrant's telling you it's okay.
[18:06.920 --> 18:12.600]  You just can't abdicate all of your responsibility over to I'm just doing my job.
[18:12.600 --> 18:15.360]  It just, it just, it doesn't sit right to me.
[18:15.360 --> 18:20.920]  So, so as I've gotten into more and more, you know, enlightenment about a lot of these
[18:20.920 --> 18:26.400]  things that these, these people at top up top are doing and I believe they're doing.
[18:26.400 --> 18:30.320]  The problem is, how do you communicate that?
[18:30.320 --> 18:35.680]  What is it's shocking to me if you say it to an average person that doesn't know how
[18:35.680 --> 18:38.160]  much they don't want to hear it?
[18:38.160 --> 18:39.880]  How much they don't care?
[18:39.880 --> 18:43.200]  How much even the look, I go, look, go to the supermarket, right?
[18:43.200 --> 18:49.000]  It, there's 10 aisles, but there's only one person working and the rest is you're checking
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.200]  out yourself.
[18:50.200 --> 18:56.240]  Like there's no more people doing jobs that you go, wait a minute, there's no more tellers.
[18:56.240 --> 19:02.840]  There's just one person taking the and this and down the road, what are the jobs going
[19:02.840 --> 19:05.560]  to be to be able to have money to even buy the food?
[19:05.560 --> 19:07.120]  It's, it's, that's what's killing me.
[19:07.120 --> 19:08.880]  It's like, it's like, wait a minute.
[19:08.880 --> 19:13.080]  If you're treating me like, like a robot, what they're doing is they're setting you
[19:13.080 --> 19:18.960]  up to get me used to dealing with robots because you're not coming, you're not being a person
[19:18.960 --> 19:19.960]  right now.
[19:19.960 --> 19:22.880]  You'll be, you'll be in a, they're, they're tricking me.
[19:22.880 --> 19:25.800]  It's not tricky because what they're doing is getting rid of your job because you cost
[19:25.800 --> 19:26.800]  them money.
[19:26.800 --> 19:31.320]  So a big business, why would I pay you if you're going to get my $800?
[19:31.320 --> 19:35.680]  Why do I want to pay out the 800 that I'm giving you to a person that's working?
[19:35.680 --> 19:39.360]  They're trying to figure out how to get rid of you and you're just helping or it's just
[19:39.360 --> 19:40.360]  my job.
[19:40.360 --> 19:41.360]  It's not going to be a job.
[19:41.360 --> 19:42.360]  No, absolutely.
[19:42.360 --> 19:43.360]  You're hitting on the key here.
[19:43.360 --> 19:44.360]  We're being deindustrialized.
[19:44.360 --> 19:50.320]  We're being turned into biological androids and we had better have an awakening to even
[19:50.320 --> 19:55.480]  salvage some of our humanity and to do that, we've got to all come together against the
[19:55.480 --> 19:56.480]  eugenics.
[19:56.480 --> 19:57.560]  We'll be right back with Patrice O'Neill.
[19:57.560 --> 20:01.160]  Stay with us.
[20:01.160 --> 20:04.880]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water
[20:04.880 --> 20:05.880]  filtration.

[22:02.640 --> 22:08.200]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[22:08.200 --> 22:15.000]  I started survivalistseeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.480]  a single rotating banner ad on prisonplanet.com.

[23:05.240 --> 23:07.240]  a global food shortage upon us.
[23:07.240 --> 23:11.080]  What if your local grocery store was suddenly closed?
[23:11.080 --> 23:12.080]  What if?

[24:04.920 --> 24:07.120]  Patrice O'Neill is our guest.
[24:07.120 --> 24:12.480]  We do have Richard Gage with huge bombshell breaking information, they had a press conference
[24:12.480 --> 24:16.680]  at the National Press Club with former Senator Gravel.
[24:16.680 --> 24:20.880]  Key information coming up in the first 30 minutes of the third hour with Richard Gage,
[24:20.880 --> 24:26.820]  the head of architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, less than 24 hours from the 9th year
[24:26.820 --> 24:30.840]  anniversary of the tragic attacks that have been used to butcher our liberties and freedoms
[24:30.840 --> 24:33.160]  and launch all these illegal wars.
[24:33.160 --> 24:34.160]  That is coming up.
[24:34.160 --> 24:37.240]  It's the case you were trying to get into eugenics before the break cut you off.
[24:37.240 --> 24:40.760]  You were saying that that's the ultimate level and I agree with you and they play us off
[24:40.760 --> 24:42.160]  against each other.
[24:42.160 --> 24:47.560]  They're dehumanizing us, they're deindustrializing us to make us dependent on the system.
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.400]  But the end game is forced population reduction.
[24:52.400 --> 24:59.360]  It's the high, I'm laughing right because as a newbie to it, I mean I would say last
[24:59.360 --> 25:09.560]  two or three years, it's shocking man that I think eugenics is the most difficult to
[25:09.560 --> 25:12.240]  digest out of any of it.
[25:12.240 --> 25:17.200]  I think the fact that there might be some people that need that are trying to kill human
[25:17.200 --> 25:20.880]  beings I think is the hardest thing for people to believe.
[25:20.880 --> 25:25.040]  But as you open and what I like about your films is this, you don't just, it's easy
[25:25.040 --> 25:34.120]  to go, this guy's crazy, but you give things in your movies that say okay go to HR this
[25:34.120 --> 25:40.600]  and go to executive order that and it's difficult to deal with HR 1000s because it's crazy.
[25:40.600 --> 25:44.840]  So I'm telling you I'm going to take your word for it with that HR or executive order
[25:44.840 --> 25:51.600]  stuff because it's a Bible's worth of stuff you got to read through but that's the thing
[25:51.600 --> 25:58.640]  I like about watching your films is that it's brought me here, it all does come together.
[25:58.640 --> 26:03.240]  Well, when we show a bill, when we show a bill or executive order though, we zoom in
[26:03.240 --> 26:04.240]  on the subsection.
[26:04.240 --> 26:08.400]  I mean here's an example, the last three weeks we have written article after article with
[26:08.400 --> 26:13.120]  direct links to the Rockefeller Foundation and they're just like 20 page documents.
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.640]  You can read them where they say we're going to develop vaccines that reduce fertility
[26:17.640 --> 26:21.000]  and they even talk about so we don't sterilize everybody because then people would notice
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.240]  that we just hurt a certain amount of people.
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.480]  That no one cares about, let's start with Africa, easy to do, well a lot of poor people
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.480]  nobody cares.
[26:29.480 --> 26:34.160]  Well see you bring up race and I will say most libertarians, most patriots that I know,
[26:34.160 --> 26:39.240]  the media would call right wing are not racist but they do understand that there are elements
[26:39.240 --> 26:44.320]  and that the Republicans have taken over the Tea Party and are basically putting out code
[26:44.320 --> 26:49.440]  words but at the same time denying it but here's another issue, the ultimate racist
[26:49.440 --> 26:54.080]  are the so-called liberals on the top because when you actually read their writings 80 years
[26:54.080 --> 26:58.520]  ago they said we've got to oppose as liberals so the blacks trust us and then you see the
[26:58.520 --> 27:05.320]  result 51%, let me ask you this, 51% of black people since Roe v. Wade had been killed before
[27:05.320 --> 27:09.080]  they're born and then you go talk to the average black folks, they'll defend abortion
[27:09.080 --> 27:14.160]  like it's some liberal right and I go really liberal right to kill 51% of the black people.
[27:14.160 --> 27:20.520]  This is the, Alex this is the game, this is the problem, okay I'm just now looking at
[27:20.520 --> 27:21.520]  the Constitution.
[27:21.520 --> 27:26.400]  I tell you who got me, looking at the Constitution was Aaron Russo, when he's like democracy
[27:26.400 --> 27:30.600]  is that thing where he says two wolves in a sheep voting on what's for dinner, it changed
[27:30.600 --> 27:31.600]  my life.
[27:31.600 --> 27:36.000]  I think that's the most amazing quote I've ever heard that puts democracy in perspective.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  Thomas Jefferson originally.
[27:37.000 --> 27:43.960]  Well that I heard from him, even, but I'm looking at the Constitution and for some reason
[27:43.960 --> 27:50.480]  growing up black with just being black, the Constitution is poison words for black people
[27:50.480 --> 27:53.000]  because we feel we're not involved in it anyway.
[27:53.000 --> 28:02.320]  But the idea of freedom of the press and then freedom to carry arms, why it's important
[28:02.320 --> 28:09.880]  and this is easy is because it's to protect us from a dictator, it's separation of state
[28:09.880 --> 28:17.200]  when Bush took over the separation of, not separation of state, but separation of power.
[28:17.200 --> 28:23.920]  The powers of the, separation of powers, you got it, the House representative and the president
[28:23.920 --> 28:30.680]  to protect us from a dictator and all these things are trying to be destroyed so that
[28:30.680 --> 28:36.960]  a dictator can come right in and take over, but black people somehow in the system of
[28:36.960 --> 28:41.560]  just regular government, we feel ostracized from these words.
[28:41.560 --> 28:46.040]  We are like even the crazy, what black people call the crazy crackers in the hills that
[28:46.040 --> 28:51.000]  say we did look, we don't, we want, we, we won't kill you if you come on our property.
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.200]  Black people automatically think those people are crazy, but those people are the revolutionaries
[28:57.200 --> 28:58.960]  of our time.
[28:58.960 --> 29:03.920]  They live how the people who freed the country from England live.
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.640]  They think like that, but to a black person, whatever the, the news thing does, it makes
[29:09.640 --> 29:14.680]  us think that those people are insane and out to get me.
[29:14.680 --> 29:20.600]  That's the, that's the game they play so that black people don't get deep into the
[29:20.600 --> 29:21.600]  new world order because-
[29:21.600 --> 29:22.880]  It's another divide and conquer.
[29:22.880 --> 29:24.400]  It's a divide and conquer thing.
[29:24.400 --> 29:25.400]  It's-
[29:25.400 --> 29:26.400]  We'll stay there.
[29:26.400 --> 29:27.400]  We're going to break long segment.
[29:27.400 --> 29:28.920]  Let's pick up where you left it.
[29:28.920 --> 29:32.960]  Patrice O'Neill is our guest, patriceoneill.com.
[29:32.960 --> 29:36.280]  He's going to be at the Cap City Comedy Club tonight and tomorrow.
[29:36.280 --> 29:39.840]  Hurry and get tickets because they're probably going to sell out here in Austin, Texas.

[29:44.840 --> 29:48.000]  The website's our infowars.com and prismplanet.tv.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.720]  Stay with us.
[29:50.720 --> 29:52.040]  We're on the march.
[29:52.040 --> 29:54.480]  The empire's on the run.
[29:54.480 --> 29:59.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:59.920 --> 30:04.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[30:04.600 --> 30:08.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:08.920 --> 30:13.240]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[30:13.240 --> 30:14.560]  allows you to have.
[30:14.560 --> 30:15.560]  It's true.
[30:15.560 --> 30:20.280]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[30:20.280 --> 30:24.600]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[30:24.600 --> 30:28.600]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:28.600 --> 30:32.080]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[30:32.080 --> 30:35.800]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[30:35.800 --> 30:40.520]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:40.520 --> 30:44.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[30:44.320 --> 30:45.720]  one of my old sponsors.

[32:00.320 --> 32:02.400]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[32:02.400 --> 32:06.360]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.

[32:58.880 --> 33:10.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:10.960 --> 33:19.600]  We're going to be going back to him in just a moment.
[33:19.600 --> 33:23.680]  We ended that special a few days ago where you got five films for $9.95.
[33:23.680 --> 33:27.080]  We sold out of all those documentaries.
[33:27.080 --> 33:31.600]  We have a few hundred of each just to fill mail orders for those, but we have a new special
[33:31.600 --> 33:34.640]  that's only going to run for a couple of weeks.
[33:34.640 --> 33:36.360]  The Obama deception, we sold out of that.
[33:36.360 --> 33:39.520]  We've now gotten a few thousand more of these in.
[33:39.520 --> 33:41.680]  When these are gone, it's over.
[33:41.680 --> 33:45.760]  The Obama deception that really shatters the left-right paradigm, and you may be awake,
[33:45.760 --> 33:49.680]  but as your neighbor, or your friends, as your boss, or your employees, as your church,
[33:49.680 --> 33:51.600]  they need to see this film.
[33:51.600 --> 33:55.520]  Republicans watch it because they hate Obama, and then they see the film and it exposes
[33:55.520 --> 33:57.600]  Bush and the whole New World Order.
[33:57.600 --> 34:00.680]  Democrats watch it because they think, oh, they're going to see some right-wing disinfo
[34:00.680 --> 34:04.560]  piece and they find out that it's a much larger paradigm.
[34:04.560 --> 34:06.920]  And that's what we're doing is getting people outside the box.
[34:06.920 --> 34:16.600]  You can get this film, 1995, and get a 2495 book free, Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies.
[34:16.600 --> 34:18.320]  He covers everything in this book.
[34:18.320 --> 34:22.400]  It's very well-written, a very easy read, a great gift to give someone.
[34:22.400 --> 34:24.080]  Read it yourself and give it away.
[34:24.080 --> 34:31.520]  Get a free Jesse Ventura book, New York Times best-selling author, American Conspiracies,
[34:31.520 --> 34:33.120]  hardcover free.
[34:33.120 --> 34:39.480]  So that is a 2495 book free when you get the Obama Deception.
[34:39.480 --> 34:40.960]  But these are going to sell out very quickly.
[34:40.960 --> 34:42.840]  The books are going to sell out very quickly.
[34:42.840 --> 34:46.780]  We've only got a few thousand of these and a few thousand of the Obama Deception.
[34:46.780 --> 34:50.120]  When this is gone, it's gone, infowars.com.
[34:50.120 --> 34:53.080]  And your purchase of the books and the videos makes this broadcast possible.
[34:53.080 --> 34:56.440]  We've got a lot of other specials where you buy a t-shirt and get a free ball cap or
[34:56.440 --> 34:58.840]  buy one video, get another video free.
[34:58.840 --> 35:00.440]  It is your support of this show.
[35:00.440 --> 35:04.080]  I'm not getting $50 million or $40 million a year like Glenn Beck.
[35:04.080 --> 35:06.680]  I don't have Fox News behind me, okay?
[35:06.680 --> 35:07.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[35:07.840 --> 35:10.480]  I'm the guy that makes the decision on what computers to buy.
[35:10.480 --> 35:12.680]  I'm the guy that sometimes carries the trash out.
[35:12.680 --> 35:15.480]  I'm the guy that has to decide what furniture to get for the new studio.
[35:15.480 --> 35:16.480]  I'm not complaining.
[35:16.480 --> 35:20.320]  It's just I could do so much more if I wasn't the guy that has to run it all.
[35:20.320 --> 35:22.760]  And if we had more support, I could do that.
[35:22.760 --> 35:24.560]  And we're really trying to hire a couple more people.
[35:24.560 --> 35:26.520]  We're trying to buy the equipment for the studio.
[35:26.520 --> 35:31.240]  So when you also purchase these great books and videos, it makes everything we do possible.
[35:31.240 --> 35:37.120]  So again, infowars.com to get your free copy of American conspiracy theory when you get

[36:01.720 --> 36:04.240]  when you get a copy of the Obama deception.
[36:04.240 --> 36:06.400]  But this great special isn't going to last long.
[36:06.400 --> 36:08.040]  So please take advantage of it.
[36:08.040 --> 36:15.560]  Going back to a very popular nationally known comic, but also social commentary individual,
[36:15.560 --> 36:21.360]  HBO specials, Comedy Central Specials, you name it, PatrisoNeal, PatrisoNeal.com, you
[36:21.360 --> 36:22.360]  got cut off.
[36:22.360 --> 36:27.240]  You were making the point about the hellbillies trying to stay out of the system, you know,
[36:27.240 --> 36:30.360]  the black folks, the way the media pushes it is, you know, anybody lives in the country
[36:30.360 --> 36:33.040]  is basically a racist that wants to, you know, get you.
[36:33.040 --> 36:35.960]  And then you were saying, Alex, am I right that Waco really woke you up into a certain
[36:35.960 --> 36:36.960]  extent?
[36:36.960 --> 36:37.960]  That was the real trigger.
[36:37.960 --> 36:40.720]  So we were talking about that during the break.
[36:40.720 --> 36:41.720]  Please continue.
[36:41.720 --> 36:42.720]  Yeah.
[36:42.720 --> 36:47.400]  I was just going to say that more black people should be into this, into this globalization
[36:47.400 --> 36:48.400]  game.
[36:48.400 --> 36:55.720]  You know, the idea of it, but it's whatever the news does in this country, it's to separate.
[36:55.720 --> 37:00.040]  If you look at history, anybody that tried to bring black and white people together got
[37:00.040 --> 37:05.120]  killed, you know, no one, anybody who as soon as Malcolm X stops saying white, he's the
[37:05.120 --> 37:06.120]  devil.
[37:06.120 --> 37:07.120]  Boom.
[37:07.120 --> 37:09.520]  As soon as he thought, whoa, wait, maybe I'm wrong.
[37:09.520 --> 37:10.520]  Get your hand on my pocket.
[37:10.520 --> 37:11.520]  He got killed.
[37:11.520 --> 37:17.920]  And, you know, mom with the king, same deal, JFK, but black people love JFK.
[37:17.920 --> 37:18.920]  Well, he was for real.
[37:18.920 --> 37:19.920]  He got killed.
[37:19.920 --> 37:25.760]  Jesus gone to anybody who tries to bring people together for the right reasons.
[37:25.760 --> 37:27.320]  They get off, man.
[37:27.320 --> 37:33.160]  And well, they're always bringing folks together against the corrupt elite and they get offed.
[37:33.160 --> 37:38.280]  So the thing is, when you keep, when you keep me thinking, what do I care about having a
[37:38.280 --> 37:39.280]  gun?
[37:39.280 --> 37:40.280]  I can't have, I got a, I got a conviction.
[37:40.280 --> 37:42.160]  So I can't have a gun anyway, legally.
[37:42.160 --> 37:46.320]  So if, you know, to, to, to the average black person in the street and that's why they want
[37:46.320 --> 37:47.960]  to get everybody into the system.
[37:47.960 --> 37:53.440]  Well, it's like this black guy up in Long Island, 25 MS 13s are rushing his house and
[37:53.440 --> 37:54.680]  we're going to kill your kids.
[37:54.680 --> 37:55.960]  He shoots the gun in the ground.
[37:55.960 --> 37:57.120]  They were legal.
[37:57.120 --> 37:58.440]  His guns were legal.
[37:58.440 --> 38:00.240]  And they arrested him.
[38:00.240 --> 38:01.960]  And the cops said, well, you could have killed him.
[38:01.960 --> 38:05.960]  It's like something out of Grand Torino, but you couldn't shoot the gun in the ground
[38:05.960 --> 38:06.960]  to protect yourself.
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.120]  So he shot in the air and they called it, whatever they call it, man.
[38:10.120 --> 38:13.600]  This is why I tell a lot of people, like a lot of people do have this thing about the
[38:13.600 --> 38:16.280]  police where they go, you know, we have rights.
[38:16.280 --> 38:22.040]  The, the, the people, man, police have things that they can do to just take your look disorderly
[38:22.040 --> 38:27.160]  conduct is it ends all your ideas that you think you have rights.
[38:27.160 --> 38:32.280]  If a cop says move and you go, no, I have the right to be here disorderly, that's basically
[38:32.280 --> 38:35.520]  destroys or failure to follow an order to follow.
[38:35.520 --> 38:36.520]  So what's the next thing?
[38:36.520 --> 38:37.520]  Come to your house.
[38:37.520 --> 38:38.520]  Knock, knock.
[38:38.520 --> 38:39.520]  I want you to go mow my yard.
[38:39.520 --> 38:42.360]  And you say, no, you're, you're going to get exactly a lot of police or stuff.
[38:42.360 --> 38:47.480]  But this is what the problem is, one of the problems I fly a lot, you fly a lot.
[38:47.480 --> 38:55.640]  The people are supposed to be our elite who, the people who know how to have power over
[38:55.640 --> 38:59.080]  another person, meaning this, you have a, you have a physical presence.
[38:59.080 --> 39:00.480]  I have a physical presence.
[39:00.480 --> 39:06.200]  So you know what it's like to be respected just cause you exist.
[39:06.200 --> 39:12.520]  A lot of people who have power don't know had never knew what it was like to be respected
[39:12.520 --> 39:14.120]  just because they exist.
[39:14.120 --> 39:18.680]  So if you get a lot of weak people who are now put into powerful positions, they, they're
[39:18.680 --> 39:21.200]  really, really corrupted by that.
[39:21.200 --> 39:22.200]  Well, that's what I found.
[39:22.200 --> 39:27.000]  A lot of people who innately are powerful are embarrassed of exercising power, but, but
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.480]  these little nobody thugs, they are just loving it because they're weak.
[39:32.480 --> 39:36.760]  And that's what the system is made up of is all these petty people that it's a new class.
[39:36.760 --> 39:37.760]  They're above us.
[39:37.760 --> 39:43.840]  I flew with Jesse Ventura and at the Atlanta airport, he's got a hip replacement.
[39:43.840 --> 39:48.520]  And I watched Ventura and, and, and, and mainly old folks that have hip replacements
[39:48.520 --> 39:53.440]  being searched and Ventura said to me, that's why he wants to leave this country period
[39:53.440 --> 39:57.800]  because he said it's the act of domination and humiliation.
[39:57.800 --> 40:01.440]  Every time he flies the pat down, putting their hands on him and I was watching them
[40:01.440 --> 40:04.560]  do it to women and, and you know, that's your personal space.
[40:04.560 --> 40:07.920]  It has nothing to do with terrorism and it's dog training.
[40:07.920 --> 40:11.440]  They are training us to have somebody in our space and they're always, and now they got
[40:11.440 --> 40:17.000]  the naked body scanners and the thing about the naked body scanners, I look, I, I cause
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.160]  problems when I go to the airport.
[40:18.160 --> 40:23.440]  I always go to the airport three hours or four hours before I have to fly just so I can
[40:23.440 --> 40:26.520]  see what rights I supposed to have.
[40:26.520 --> 40:31.040]  So LA was the first time I've seen the X-ray machines.
[40:31.040 --> 40:35.280]  You can say no to the X-ray machines, but now they said, but they admit they're phasing
[40:35.280 --> 40:36.280]  an end to make you.
[40:36.280 --> 40:38.280]  Well, here's what they do.
[40:38.280 --> 40:40.680]  They don't just say yet and make you now.
[40:40.680 --> 40:43.920]  But what they do is they make life so miserable.
[40:43.920 --> 40:46.760]  If you don't, that you think about doing it.
[40:46.760 --> 40:49.680]  Now I said, look, I don't want to take, I don't take anything off that I don't have
[40:49.680 --> 40:50.680]  to.
[40:50.680 --> 40:51.680]  You have to take your shoes off.
[40:51.680 --> 40:53.120]  You have to take your coat off.
[40:53.120 --> 40:56.160]  I don't take anything, which is another act of submission submission.
[40:56.160 --> 40:58.160]  I don't take my jewelry off and my hat.
[40:58.160 --> 41:00.160]  You can keep your hat on if you want to.
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.000]  You can keep on your belt if you need, if you want to, but you have to choose to take
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.520]  that check, right?
[41:05.520 --> 41:11.480]  Now what they did is when I said no to the X-ray machine, all my stuff was going through.
[41:11.480 --> 41:16.360]  So there's thousands of people's stuff on top of my computer, on top of my clothes,
[41:16.360 --> 41:21.720]  on the floor, and they keep me on the side to make life really miserable so that I go,
[41:21.720 --> 41:24.760]  okay, next time I'm going to go through because I don't want my computer to be over there
[41:24.760 --> 41:25.760]  by itself.
[41:25.760 --> 41:32.440]  But I'm like, look, I'm not going to, anything that I can do to keep a hold of the fact that
[41:32.440 --> 41:35.480]  I have a little bit of dignity, I'm going to keep a hold of them.
[41:35.480 --> 41:36.480]  Here's the good news.
[41:36.480 --> 41:37.980]  You're resisting.
[41:37.980 --> 41:39.920]  First they lied and said they weren't saving the images.
[41:39.920 --> 41:41.320]  Then now they admit they're saving them all.
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.880]  They're going in courthouses, state and federal, mobile vans, high-powered ones that the government
[41:45.880 --> 41:48.080]  will bought 500 that beam your house.
[41:48.080 --> 41:50.520]  It's admitted it causes cancer.
[41:50.520 --> 41:51.880]  That's how insane it is.
[41:51.880 --> 41:55.300]  15 years ago, the army admitted DU will kill you dead in a hammer.
[41:55.300 --> 41:58.600]  Now they tell the troops it didn't bad for you, use it, and they're dying, and they just
[41:58.600 --> 42:00.460]  say, hey, go ahead and die.
[42:00.460 --> 42:04.560]  So they're setting the precedent, but now because of the protest and people saying no,
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.400]  they're claiming, oh, we've got a computer that computerizes your image and covers up
[42:08.400 --> 42:09.400]  your genitals.
[42:09.400 --> 42:11.040]  First they lied and said it didn't show them.
[42:11.040 --> 42:14.960]  And so it's just an image of a man with a baseball cap, and then the computer with AI
[42:14.960 --> 42:19.080]  technology is going to tell them what area to supposedly search.
[42:19.080 --> 42:20.080]  But we know that's a lie.
[42:20.080 --> 42:21.720]  They're still saving the image.
[42:21.720 --> 42:26.060]  They just do this digital overlay over it, but the point is we're going to defeat those
[42:26.060 --> 42:30.480]  naked body scanners because almost everybody I know just isn't traveling now, and it's
[42:30.480 --> 42:32.160]  bankrupting the airlines.
[42:32.160 --> 42:34.960]  That's why they're having to come out now and start to back off.
[42:34.960 --> 42:39.920]  And it's because of the people that they have in charge.
[42:39.920 --> 42:47.520]  If we had elite, like I watch on tapes, the Mujahideen, they out practicing how to shoot
[42:47.520 --> 42:54.160]  two M16s with two pistols, you know, shooting apples off of things, like, when I watched
[42:54.160 --> 42:57.800]  them, I go, whew, those dudes are trying to kill me.
[42:57.800 --> 43:03.840]  Now I look at who we have as supposed to be our protectors.
[43:03.840 --> 43:05.840]  It's a mess.
[43:05.840 --> 43:10.320]  The airports, the police, they're just a mess.
[43:10.320 --> 43:14.680]  Sometimes you get a small lady cop, I'm telling you, I'm being honest, you get a small lady
[43:14.680 --> 43:16.600]  cop who talks to me.
[43:16.600 --> 43:18.520]  You got a Napoleon complex.
[43:18.520 --> 43:24.760]  I say, look, miss, you got to understand, I respect the law, but if you arrested me,
[43:24.760 --> 43:30.840]  you should say thank you to me for allowing you to because you can't arrest me without
[43:30.840 --> 43:35.120]  my respect for the law in general.
[43:35.120 --> 43:40.240]  So when you come at me with this, this angry forceful thing, you got to stand, I'm a person
[43:40.240 --> 43:41.240]  to person.
[43:41.240 --> 43:43.360]  If you wasn't a cop, you wouldn't be talking to me like this.
[43:43.360 --> 43:46.920]  I like cops who can arrest me if they weren't a cop.
[43:46.920 --> 43:50.280]  Like I go, all right, sir, let's talk about it.
[43:50.280 --> 43:53.520]  And usually those guys are nicer people.
[43:53.520 --> 43:58.440]  But when you get a punk who's now got some kind of weird power where they think they
[43:58.440 --> 44:00.640]  are the law as opposed to their existence.
[44:00.640 --> 44:01.640]  So that's what I've noticed.
[44:01.640 --> 44:06.080]  If you've got some big giant cop with arms that are huge, they're really nice.
[44:06.080 --> 44:07.640]  It's always the little guy.
[44:07.640 --> 44:10.040]  Because it's a bad place to put them in that pop.
[44:10.040 --> 44:14.000]  But maybe like you said, it's it's planned, but all of this stuff is planned.
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.960]  And that's why I'm like going back to the no, they admit they're psychologically profiling.
[44:17.960 --> 44:21.080]  And now first it was won't don't hire a cop over a hundred IQ.
[44:21.080 --> 44:23.120]  Now they're one of them with 90 IQs.
[44:23.120 --> 44:27.960]  So they're just dumbered in a box of rocks on a power trip and somebody who had a little
[44:27.960 --> 44:35.880]  bit of dignity and a little bit of prowess, they would be embarrassed to be this person.
[44:35.880 --> 44:36.880]  And that's real.
[44:36.880 --> 44:40.400]  And that's the thing when I go back to the to the black and white thing, man, I don't
[44:40.400 --> 44:43.240]  I don't want people to think, oh, I'm white people.
[44:43.240 --> 44:49.920]  I'm saying that as I'm becoming informed, I can understand why black people because
[44:49.920 --> 44:52.480]  I'm I'm still not removed from black folks.
[44:52.480 --> 44:56.840]  I understand why more black people aren't involved.
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.160]  You can see but you're outside the box now see you've broken your paradigm so you can
[45:01.160 --> 45:06.160]  look at it as a third party from outside to clearly make decisions from an unemotional
[45:06.160 --> 45:07.160]  perspective.
[45:07.160 --> 45:12.600]  But but going back to two gun laws, the first gun laws were passed after the civil war in
[45:12.600 --> 45:14.440]  the south against black people.
[45:14.440 --> 45:18.720]  So then how the black folks then support the Democratic Party who says, you know, we're
[45:18.720 --> 45:22.880]  going to take your guns away from you or throw you in jail if you try to have a gun to protect
[45:22.880 --> 45:23.880]  yourself.
[45:23.880 --> 45:28.440]  And again, so so the Republican Party, it will promote part of your rights, but try to
[45:28.440 --> 45:29.720]  take away the other part.
[45:29.720 --> 45:31.520]  The Democrats try to give you the other rights.
[45:31.520 --> 45:34.640]  The Republicans don't want to give you but try to take away the other rights.
[45:34.640 --> 45:36.680]  And between the two parties, you've lost them all.
[45:36.680 --> 45:45.800]  But a lot of people, Alex, that that don't understand the idea of having a gun, a lot
[45:45.800 --> 45:49.240]  of black people don't understand what the idea is.
[45:49.240 --> 45:55.320]  They think it's to keep some some some gangs out your house.
[45:55.320 --> 46:00.880]  It's to protect you from a dictatorship, a overthrow.
[46:00.880 --> 46:02.280]  Well, it does both.
[46:02.280 --> 46:03.280]  Yeah.
[46:03.280 --> 46:05.280]  It does both.
[46:05.280 --> 46:09.080]  But the idea mostly for a black person in a bad neighborhood is that and then there's
[46:09.080 --> 46:12.520]  some white people who don't know what the right to have a gun is.
[46:12.520 --> 46:16.280]  A lot of white people think the right to have a gun means I have the right to have one.
[46:16.280 --> 46:21.480]  It's you have one to protect yourself from things you protect.
[46:21.480 --> 46:27.040]  Well, I mean, bottom line, bottom line, bottom line, if a lion has had his teeth taken out
[46:27.040 --> 46:34.400]  and his claws deep, you know, de-clawed, that is a domesticated, de-fang, de-clawed creature.
[46:34.400 --> 46:38.400]  A free man or woman has the right to own guns.
[46:38.400 --> 46:41.960]  I mean, it goes back 200 years ago to blacks not being able to even own a knife.
[46:41.960 --> 46:42.960]  It goes back to Rome.
[46:42.960 --> 46:47.320]  I mean, if you read the actual history books written by Julius Caesar and others, when they
[46:47.320 --> 46:52.800]  rolled into Germany and rolled into Austria and rolled into other countries, rolled into
[46:52.800 --> 46:55.320]  England, which was all beyond at the time.
[46:55.320 --> 46:58.480]  The first thing they did was they took the women and children.
[46:58.480 --> 47:02.320]  They killed most of the men and they disarmed everybody.
[47:02.320 --> 47:04.200]  So it's very elementary.
[47:04.200 --> 47:08.000]  Any country you look at where the people aren't armed, you're going to have an out of control
[47:08.000 --> 47:09.000]  government.
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.000]  So it's a check and a balance.
[47:10.000 --> 47:11.000]  It's real simple.
[47:11.000 --> 47:12.480]  You know, it's like a fish out of water.
[47:12.480 --> 47:15.080]  It's going to, it's going to die doing it ourselves though.
[47:15.080 --> 47:16.080]  That's the thing.
[47:16.080 --> 47:20.680]  That's my problem is that we're doing the average person is doing it.
[47:20.680 --> 47:25.600]  It's not like they, it's not like they're coming in and really taking anything from you.
[47:25.600 --> 47:30.760]  They're putting us in a position to be afraid and say, please come protect me.
[47:30.760 --> 47:32.280]  And here's how we're going to protect you.
[47:32.280 --> 47:33.360]  Give me your gun.
[47:33.360 --> 47:35.820]  Let me have a gun and I'll fix everything.
[47:35.820 --> 47:38.960]  We believe that the government, yeah, that's like the mafia.
[47:38.960 --> 47:42.840]  Can you imagine, you know, the mafia says, pay me protection money or I'll burn down
[47:42.840 --> 47:44.040]  your grocery store.
[47:44.040 --> 47:45.040]  It's the same thing.
[47:45.040 --> 47:48.520]  The government says, you're not allowed to protect yourself.
[47:48.520 --> 47:52.600]  We'll do it for you, but then if we don't show up on time with the 911 calls, sorry,
[47:52.600 --> 47:53.600]  no liability.
[47:53.600 --> 47:54.600]  Right.
[47:54.600 --> 48:01.560]  It's, but it's at the, at the level you're at, it's just too easy to think like that.
[48:01.560 --> 48:03.840]  It's the level of these people walking around.
[48:03.840 --> 48:07.320]  I mean, right now you mean you're a shepherd, you know, and there's, you know, you got the
[48:07.320 --> 48:10.680]  Glenn Beck's and you got everybody that's out here fighting their shepherds.
[48:10.680 --> 48:14.880]  And right now it's just a, it's a lot of sheep just deciding on what shepherd they're
[48:14.880 --> 48:15.880]  going to follow.
[48:15.880 --> 48:17.440]  But I think that's my number one message.
[48:17.440 --> 48:21.280]  Don't be a sheep, be your own leader.
[48:21.280 --> 48:27.280]  That seems, that seems elementary, but I know a lot of people that don't, my girl, she,
[48:27.280 --> 48:32.600]  she, she needs me to even disagree with something.
[48:32.600 --> 48:36.560]  She needs me to have a point so that she can have a point.
[48:36.560 --> 48:37.560]  You understand what I'm saying?
[48:37.560 --> 48:39.520]  I mean, and she don't just go, here's what I think.
[48:39.520 --> 48:41.200]  She waits to see what I think.
[48:41.200 --> 48:44.320]  And then she either agrees with it or don't agree with it.
[48:44.320 --> 48:45.320]  That's most people.
[48:45.320 --> 48:48.440]  They're not looking to go, you know, I'm going to start something myself.
[48:48.440 --> 48:49.440]  No, they're spectators.
[48:49.440 --> 48:50.440]  You're right.
[48:50.440 --> 48:54.480]  You have to bring up a point to even get them to even begin to realize that there is a spectrum
[48:54.480 --> 48:55.480]  of ideas.
[48:55.480 --> 48:56.480]  Right.
[48:56.480 --> 49:00.920]  And they won't, they said, they just wait for you to say something and either go, he's
[49:00.920 --> 49:03.640]  crazy or I love this guy.
[49:03.640 --> 49:06.160]  They don't, they're not trying to unfold.
[49:06.160 --> 49:10.080]  That's why I said again, the reason I enjoy your tapes is because you'll do a lot of stuff
[49:10.080 --> 49:12.320]  to say, look, don't listen to me.
[49:12.320 --> 49:13.320]  Go over here.
[49:13.320 --> 49:17.200]  I read this thing about Henry Kissinger, I forgot what it was, but it was, it was a,
[49:17.200 --> 49:24.000]  it was a blueprint on how to, how to destroy governments and, and kill the people.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  State Department memorandum 200.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  It was, it was shocking.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  And I'm going, this is, it's real.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  Yeah.
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  I'm not listening to Alex Jones or Alan White or whoever I'm listening, I'm, they tell
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  you to go do things.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  And I'm like, it exists.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  People aren't.
[49:32.000 --> 49:43.000]  No, no, that's the thing is I had, I had ABC news here.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.800]  A nightline and they would say, you think the government wants to rid his population.
[49:46.800 --> 49:49.480]  And I literally played them video clips of world leaders.
[49:49.480 --> 49:50.480]  I gave them all the doc.
[49:50.480 --> 49:51.560]  I said, and they wouldn't even look.
[49:51.560 --> 49:53.160]  They'd laugh at me.
[49:53.160 --> 49:55.520]  And they realized that most people are sheep.
[49:55.520 --> 50:00.600]  So as long as they just laugh and never in the piece, let me show them any proof.
[50:00.600 --> 50:02.560]  It's just, oh, it's this guy's opinion.
[50:02.560 --> 50:04.640]  So do you choose to believe him?
[50:04.640 --> 50:06.360]  And they kept asking me, do you really believe this?
[50:06.360 --> 50:07.360]  Do you really believe this?
[50:07.360 --> 50:08.560]  And I said, of course I believe it.
[50:08.560 --> 50:09.560]  I know it's true.
[50:09.560 --> 50:10.760]  And then they went further on the show.
[50:10.760 --> 50:14.520]  They said, you know, we don't even think Alex Jones believes this.
[50:14.520 --> 50:18.240]  And for somebody who's awake, that's ineffective and looks ridiculous.
[50:18.240 --> 50:22.920]  But you're right, Patrice, they're targeting people who aren't going to look into this.
[50:22.920 --> 50:24.560]  They're just going to think this guy's making it up.
[50:24.560 --> 50:27.640]  But that's what I'm saying.
[50:27.640 --> 50:32.280]  To expose, you know, you watch the Bohemian Grove, I heard a guy, I forgot his name.
[50:32.280 --> 50:34.440]  He was talking about the Bohemian Grove.
[50:34.440 --> 50:41.880]  He goes, look, in the least, the fact that your leaders are dressing in crazy hoods and
[50:41.880 --> 50:48.720]  burning owls, doesn't that bother you to something, just on a certain human level?
[50:48.720 --> 50:53.760]  So you don't need to go to the stratosphere, all you got to do is go, yeah, that does bother
[50:53.760 --> 50:57.200]  me and then move on.
[50:57.200 --> 50:58.200]  Patrice, stay there.
[50:58.200 --> 50:59.200]  This is amazing.
[50:59.200 --> 51:01.320]  He'll be with us on the other side.
[51:01.320 --> 51:05.680]  If your handgun is loaded and easy to get to, it's also dangerous.
[51:05.680 --> 51:09.640]  What if you could reach your loaded handgun instantly and still provide a margin of safety

[52:07.960 --> 52:12.160]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[52:12.160 --> 52:13.160]  documents.
[52:13.160 --> 52:17.560]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:17.560 --> 52:20.040]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:20.040 --> 52:25.160]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[52:25.160 --> 52:26.160]  world.
[52:26.160 --> 52:31.080]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[52:31.080 --> 52:33.560]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:33.560 --> 52:38.040]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[52:38.040 --> 52:39.040]  financial system.
[52:39.040 --> 52:41.920]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:41.920 --> 52:45.640]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[52:45.640 --> 52:48.440]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[54:09.040 --> 54:10.040]  We are back live.
[54:10.040 --> 54:13.880]  Patrice O'Neill will be with us 5 minutes to the next hour, we've moved Richard Gage
[54:13.880 --> 54:15.360]  to the middle of the next hour.
[54:15.360 --> 54:17.160]  Here's the headlines.
[54:17.160 --> 54:21.560]  Corporate News runs 9-11-Truth, AE 9-11-Truth conference presents explosive evidence.
[54:21.560 --> 54:26.120]  I've got another report on that, extremely powerful information.
[54:26.120 --> 54:32.120]  They had a press conference yesterday at the National Press Club with Richard Gage, the
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.480]  head of architects and engineers for 9-11-Truth, 9-year anniversary coming up tomorrow.
[54:36.480 --> 54:39.960]  Patrice O'Neill, so many other issues to discuss.
[54:39.960 --> 54:44.800]  There is an awakening happening out there, and that's why they put these fake leaders
[54:44.800 --> 54:48.160]  out like Obama, and then whatever the next right-wing leader is going to be.
[54:48.160 --> 54:52.680]  And my point is, we are so far down this line, they're building this domestic control grid
[54:52.680 --> 54:54.720]  that is designed for we the people.
[54:54.720 --> 54:59.560]  We have better wake up and come together now for the Bill of Rights, the Constitution,
[54:59.560 --> 55:01.480]  for the Second Amendment, or it's over.
[55:01.480 --> 55:04.160]  Well, I don't think it could be done without our help.
[55:04.160 --> 55:05.880]  I mean, that's what I'm saying about.
[55:05.880 --> 55:15.680]  You know, I believe, you know, wholeheartedly in this idea of an Illuminati, of a new world
[55:15.680 --> 55:21.160]  order, of the banking system, but it's the more people I meet and the more people that
[55:21.160 --> 55:28.040]  don't care, I think to me, if I had a crusader, it would be to figure out, how do you get
[55:28.040 --> 55:33.800]  the average person to, I mean, I know the banking system opened my mind.
[55:33.800 --> 55:37.040]  That is what was the most important thing.
[55:37.040 --> 55:41.160]  If somebody came at me and said, hey, look, they're trying to get the world down to 500,000
[55:41.160 --> 55:42.160]  people.
[55:42.160 --> 55:44.520]  There's some people that just want to kill everybody and get it down to 500,000 people
[55:44.520 --> 55:45.520]  and control them.
[55:45.520 --> 55:47.560]  I'm like, okay, whatever.
[55:47.560 --> 55:48.560]  It sounds good.
[55:48.560 --> 55:56.320]  But when somebody just says the bank is private and the government borrows money and to pay
[55:56.320 --> 56:01.400]  them back, we need, or the idea of the gold standard, didn't know what it was, didn't care
[56:01.400 --> 56:02.400]  what it was.
[56:02.400 --> 56:06.200]  But once I understood why gold exists, I'm going, now it doesn't.
[56:06.200 --> 56:08.240]  We're not on the gold standard now.
[56:08.240 --> 56:10.280]  We're on the debt standard.
[56:10.280 --> 56:13.600]  The fact that I owe money means that we have money.
[56:13.600 --> 56:16.200]  It's shocking to me.
[56:16.200 --> 56:20.360]  Then if, I know they can do that, I move to the next thing and the next thing and then
[56:20.360 --> 56:24.400]  I go, oh man, and as a comic, it slows me down.
[56:24.400 --> 56:27.440]  So I'm trying to, because I know Bill Hicks, man, he was open.
[56:27.440 --> 56:29.080]  He was open to it all.
[56:29.080 --> 56:34.920]  And when you're open to it all, it could drive you insane with wanting to put the information
[56:34.920 --> 56:35.920]  out.
[56:35.920 --> 56:39.280]  But I've learned how to throw it in a little bit, make a person laugh.
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.320]  And then hopefully, if I throw a little info out and a person laughs, it's like when you
[56:44.320 --> 56:49.160]  say go look at HR this and go look at the executive order that, it just, maybe they'll
[56:49.160 --> 56:53.600]  go look and it'll open their mind and then they can go.
[56:53.600 --> 56:59.920]  But the fact of dealing with people, man, people are not doing the right thing when it
[56:59.920 --> 57:00.920]  comes to this, man.
[57:00.920 --> 57:05.080]  There's a couple of people out there and when I say a couple, if a million people are into
[57:05.080 --> 57:07.080]  it, that's not enough, man.
[57:07.080 --> 57:08.080]  That's just not enough.
[57:08.080 --> 57:12.160]  They can round up a million people easy, but we need 50 million, 60 million.
[57:12.160 --> 57:13.160]  No, you're right.
[57:13.160 --> 57:16.480]  It is a life and death situation to wake up as many people.
[57:16.480 --> 57:20.120]  I mean, individuals who wake up and get really informed, they need to understand they've
[57:20.120 --> 57:24.960]  got a responsibility now to reach out to others and the system before could just deny and
[57:24.960 --> 57:26.240]  say we were liars.
[57:26.240 --> 57:31.480]  Now they try to come out and go, okay, we lied about global warming, but the UN said
[57:31.480 --> 57:34.800]  this two days ago, but it's about population reduction.
[57:34.800 --> 57:36.240]  So we've got to do this.
[57:36.240 --> 57:41.080]  Or the CIA comes out and says, okay, we did put out fake bin Laden videos.
[57:41.080 --> 57:43.160]  Okay, we are growing the opium.
[57:43.160 --> 57:46.800]  They're trying to really steal our thunder and just kind of put it out there in our
[57:46.800 --> 57:47.800]  face.
[57:47.800 --> 57:55.280]  It's too late at 500 million bad eggs, I'm going, I said, do you hear that 500 million
[57:55.280 --> 57:56.280]  bad eggs?
[57:56.280 --> 57:59.640]  And you go, and when I say to people, it's cause it's cause a lot of people didn't take
[57:59.640 --> 58:03.360]  the, the egg vaks, the vaccine that they had to grow in the eggs.
[58:03.360 --> 58:06.520]  So they like, Hey, since it didn't take them, let's just put them back out.
[58:06.520 --> 58:12.240]  People dropping dead from, from the vaccine eggs that, you know, you had to grow the H1N1
[58:12.240 --> 58:13.560]  inside the eggs.
[58:13.560 --> 58:15.000]  And it's just like, it didn't work.
[58:15.000 --> 58:20.400]  So now they just got these eggs sitting around and they try to put them out there.
[58:20.400 --> 58:21.720]  Those eggs are now poison.
[58:21.720 --> 58:23.720]  Now they got to figure out they salmonella.
[58:23.720 --> 58:29.720]  I'm like, look, there's no way 500 million eggs got salmonella poisoning in it.
[58:29.720 --> 58:33.000]  But people go, well, that's what they told me.
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.880]  And I go, trees stay there, we're going to do five more minutes.
[58:36.880 --> 58:50.680]  We're back in 70 seconds, you are listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today, Alex Jones

[59:47.240 --> 01:00:12.640]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:22.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:29.440]  Well it's been an amazing interview with a nationally known comedian, Patrice O'Neill,
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.560]  and we got five more minutes with him and I wanted to get into the Koran situation.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.440]  I mean, I'm going to get into this after he leaves us, then Richard Gage is coming on.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.200]  But bottom line, I defended the right of that mosque to be built down there, two blocks
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:49.600]  from ground zero, but I also don't agree with him, but I agree with his right for that preacher
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:54.200]  to burn the Koran and the fact now that they're in the Middle East, they're burning bibles
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.200]  and things.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.800]  You know, the issue is if you don't like the United States that you can burn a Bible,
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.160]  you can burn a Koran, you can burn an American flag, I think that's disrespectful and bad
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.160]  on every front.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.000]  I'm not looking to insult people.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.880]  But now that this guy's maybe saying he's going to back off and the media has been talking
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.400]  about maybe it should be illegal to burn a Koran, well then first of them it's gone.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.400]  Patrice O'Neill.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:21.160]  I agree with the fact that you do have your right to do things, but there is tact.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.240]  And I'm going to tell you, burning a Koran, and this is my thing about burning a Koran
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.400]  and burning a Bible and whatever, it's burning their God.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.040]  That's the thing that bothers me.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:39.360]  It's that look and it goes again to the lying in this country.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.360]  No one has a problem with Islam itself.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.040]  I mean, Farrakhan is Muslim.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:51.720]  So no one would burn a Koran to demonstrate that they hate Lewis Farrakhan because he's
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.480]  genuine American, whether people agree with him or not, you know, he's American.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.560]  People don't have a problem with Islam.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:01.600]  They have a problem with Arabs and no one wants to say that they don't like Arabs in
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.600]  this country.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:08.760]  It's not about the Bible and the Koran, it's about those people in this country.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:16.080]  Let me tell you, and I agree, I believe this, Arabs have not yet gone through what everyone
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.560]  else has gone through in this country to be certified American.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.760]  You go through some foulness for people to go, phew, they're American.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:29.280]  Japanese did it, Chinese did it, blacks did it, Irish did it, everyone's done it, except
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280]  for Arabs.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:38.720]  And there is no, and here's the thing, everyone who does bad in their particular group has
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.920]  another part of their group who condemns things that they do that are wrong.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:49.560]  Arabs don't have, and maybe it's the news that's doing it, but you don't see enough
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:55.320]  Arabs that go, what these Arabs are doing is wrong.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.680]  There is, you ask the Arab, hey, what do you think about 9-11?
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.640]  It's like, well, when you're pushed to do things, you have to go through.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:07.920]  It's like, nah, just say, flying planes in the buildings might be wrong.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.680]  Just say, don't give me an excuse of why people gotta die.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.120]  Just say, look, blowing up this guy might not be the right thing.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.240]  I don't think enough Arabs are vocal enough against the ones that are just doing bad stuff
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.840]  to make everybody else go, okay, there's a right Arab and a wrong Arab.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.760]  But that's for basic anything.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.120]  But I mean, we're almost out of time, Patrice, what about the issue of, I've supported the
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.040]  property rights issue with the mosque and criticized, because if you take away their
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.160]  right, then nobody's got a right.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.480]  But at the same time, I didn't know what to really think about this preacher and all of
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.240]  this, and I think it's being used by the media to create division.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.520]  But now, if he does back off, you can burn anything you want but a Quran.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:58.400]  But let's be honest, building that mosque, you have the right to do it.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.640]  Don't do it.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.640]  Don't do it, just because of the sentiment.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.200]  Don't burn Qurans, because it's burning someone's God.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]  Billions.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.040]  Well, I don't think it's a good idea, I mean, I don't think it's a good idea.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.040]  I don't like it.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.960]  But at the same time, first amendment is the heart of this country.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:25.440]  You have the right, but sir, Mr. Guy, the preacher in Gainesville, don't do it.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.760]  But if you don't exercise a right, you lose it.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.520]  He didn't need to even open his mouth to exercise it, just like the mosque.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.040]  You have that you can build it eight blocks away where people go, okay, you're gonna build
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.720]  it to to exercise your right.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]  I'm not crazy.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:44.880]  Don't you're not exercising a right because you could exercise your right to be decent
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.480]  to the people who are going to lose it and cause problems.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.480]  Very interesting.

[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.640]  tyranny is here.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.560]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.960]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.520]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.760]  on earth.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:22.560]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.320]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.640]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.640]  owned and operated American company.

[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.080]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.120]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120]  anywhere.

[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:41.640]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:46.640]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.800]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:09.560]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.400]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.080]  anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.840]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:25.440]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.080]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.600]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:41.520]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:48.760]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com

[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:30.760]  We are back live coming up in about 25 minutes.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:35.640]  One thousand two hundred and seventy architects engineers reveal hard evidence of explosive
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.800]  demolition at world trade centers on 9-Eleven.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.680]  Richard Gage, founder and head of architects and engineers for 9-Eleven Truth, will be
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.320]  joining us in the third hour.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:49.240]  We're going to have wide open phones and a blitzkrieg of news, but let me start getting
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.480]  into some news right now, and a lot of this is mixed together.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:09:01.040]  There's police state and all my stacks, I've got the economic news, I've got it all here,
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.440]  but first let me basically state where I'm at on the mosque and on the Burn the Koran
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:11.720]  Day.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:19.040]  At my instinctive base level, if anybody is violent to anyone burning a Koran, I'm not
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.800]  a coward, and my instinct is to burn a whole box of them.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.480]  I'm going to be honest with you right now.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:32.280]  Now I supported Muslims right to have that mosque down there at ground zero.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:37.840]  This is the United States, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the media is having
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:46.680]  this national debate about maybe we shouldn't let the pastor do this.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:52.800]  If they stop him, we've given in to intimidation by radical Muslims.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.800]  Okay?
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:58.200]  Now, 9-Eleven was staged, ladies and gentlemen, many of the radical Muslim groups out there
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:04.640]  are CIA funded, like the Taliban, that's on record, and I want Muslims to live in peace.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.160]  I want Muslims to not have their countries invaded and a million Iraqis to be killed
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.640]  and DU to put a uranium to be used all over the country, but it's very simple.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:19.000]  If you've got your right to that mosque, then if somebody wants to be disrespectful, and
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:26.200]  I don't agree with it or like it, and burn your holy book, then you have to criticize
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.520]  them, speak out against them, say whatever you want about them, but you have no right
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.680]  to threaten to kill them or to stage terror attacks, and the globalists are orchestrating
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:39.840]  this, they're promoting it, they're hyping it to get everybody at each other's throats
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:48.240]  just like it came out, the well-known CIA-connected publications three years ago ran the Prophet
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:55.960]  Muhammad with his turban as a bomb stories, and Muslims did riot all over France, all
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.120]  over other countries, and that was used to crack down on Muslims.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:05.280]  Now, if you want to be stupid and play into this, go ahead, but I will tell you this,
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:12.040]  my instinct is if the government started arresting people for burning American flags, I would
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:17.400]  never burn an American flag unless they started arresting people for it, and then I'd say
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.880]  because this flag symbolizes the Bill of Rights and Constitution, that's why we revere
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:28.400]  it, it symbolizes what our forefathers fought for, I am forced to burn this flag, I don't
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:33.040]  like it, but it's almost like when a flag's tattered and old, there's a way to get rid
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:38.280]  of it, you know, that's in the flag code.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:44.440]  This is incredible, I mean, it's not a popular stance on talk radio, which is predominantly
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:49.960]  mainline conservative to come out and say, I support their right to build that mosque,
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:56.080]  but I have to or there's no property rights, there's no free speech, no right of religion,
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:02.200]  and it's the same thing with burning the Koran, I don't like it, I mean, that's bad mojo,
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:09.120]  that's bad luck, whatever you want to call it, I'm against it.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:14.320]  But we have reports that I'm looking into out of associated content and others, Christians
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:19.200]  and Gaza fear for their lives as Muslims burn Bibles and destroy crosses, and it looks
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.840]  like this is really going on, and see, I mean, that's what the Muslims are doing in Sudan,
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.080]  blowing up churches, bombing them, they've got an air force, you hear our media really
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:34.280]  promoting that, that's wrong, and that needs to be decried, that needs to be criticized.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.400]  The globalist are orchestrating this clash of civilizations.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:44.280]  So it's okay to burn the Bible, you just don't burn the Koran.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.400]  Now what does that really say at the end of the day?
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.160]  I mean, if Muslims are really for the freedom of the United States, the Bill of Rights and
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.400]  Constitution, then they should be free under the First Amendment to criticize and to say
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.200]  whatever they want, and if they wanted to go to that event and burn Bibles right alongside
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:05.080]  it, it's a stupid idea, I'm against it.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.200]  Not just as a Christian, but as someone who supports freedom of religion.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.680]  But you know what?
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.720]  They shouldn't be arrested if they burn Bibles.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.280]  And they shouldn't be arrested if they burn Koreans.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.800]  But this whole thing is being promoted by the Washington Post, the New York Times, in
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:29.960]  the last three weeks to create this division and to create a further clash of civilizations.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.720]  And so if it gets burned, I mean, are Muslims going to come out like they did in Europe
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:38.160]  and burn down buildings and attack police and play right in to the globalist plan?
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.400]  I also don't like the fact that the FBI has gone now three times to this church in Florida.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.920]  And right after they went through the third time, that was the second, now they've been
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.920]  back again, they came out and announced, I've talked to the Imam.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.120]  They're not going to have the ground zero mosque anymore.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.120]  And so I'm going to back off.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.880]  And then the Imam came out and said, well, I didn't really say that, which I don't tend
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880]  to really believe.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.920]  I don't think the pastor would come out of the yet and been led to believe that.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:12.400]  And so now I, here's another example, the ISP, the internet service provider for the
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.640]  church, the Christian church took their website down and said, because it's hate speech.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:23.840]  See now you can't have a website because it's hate speech in England.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:30.880]  A guy had a ringtone from a movie where the guy said, I'm not a packy or I'm a packy.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.880]  What's wrong with that?
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:39.880]  Which I guess is some racial slur towards Pakistanis and he was arrested in England.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:47.960]  He served the BBC news reporter who went and gave a speech and said rural communities to
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.200]  serve the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.720]  They arrested him saying the word homosexual is hurtful.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.600]  They know the public so ignorant that the word homosexual or heterosexual, I guess
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.760]  is bad.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.880]  The word Caucasian or Negro is supposedly bad and those are just scientific names.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.000]  Like if I called a dog a canine and somebody didn't know what that meant.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.040]  They said, that's a racial slaying towards a dog.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:20.840]  You're going to be arrested for calling a dog a canine or a cat a feline or as we called
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:29.280]  a pig a poor scene or if you called a cow a bovine, you're going to be arrested.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.200]  I mean, this is the level of thought police control going on.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.800]  So later in the next hour or another phone calls, I want to get your take on this because
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.120]  I'm not saying I'm going to go out and burn a Koran.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.800]  I don't do just pure stunts like that.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.760]  It's just at an instinctive level.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:54.040]  If they do start arresting Americans for burning Korans, next you won't be able to even criticize
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.840]  a politician because they'll say, oh, this is disruptive.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:57.960]  This is hurtful.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.680]  You can't yell fire in a theater.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.640]  That's not yelling fire in a theater.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.040]  That's what this country is based on is the right.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.280]  Here's an example of it's got to be 10 years ago.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:13.920]  We had a burn the UN flag day and I did it down at the Capitol and they tried to get
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.160]  the police to arrest me for it, but they refused.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:21.240]  And so the local news shot video the same day at another location of a guy who hated
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.920]  me burning an American flag and they cut into the newscast and basically implied that I had
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:32.240]  burned an American flag and I got a bunch of hate mail over it.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:37.680]  I burned the United Nations flag because it's a symbol of tyranny and corruption and dehumanization
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.400]  and eugenics.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:45.480]  So next are they going to ban burning the UN flag because it's hurtful to the 170 something
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.680]  membered nations to the United Nations.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.680]  Yep, there's the video.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:55.600]  That was another event where they had a burn ban on so I couldn't burn it.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.120]  And so I cut it up with a knife.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.520]  I was in pretty good shape then.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.920]  That's what happens when you lift whites two hours a day or jog six miles every other day.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.840]  But they're showing video for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:16.720]  You can just search the term Alex Jones burns a UN flag Alex Jones destroys UN flag.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.520]  If you want to watch the full video from that's actually 11 or 12 years ago now that I see
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.000]  the video.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.360]  I burned the UN flag a couple times 12 years ago and then 11 years ago I sliced it up because
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.360]  they had a burn ban.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:38.280]  But side issue, this is political correctness and it's what's destroying our nation.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:44.760]  And political correctness what's six months ago, eight students were sent home from the
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:54.360]  San Francisco mental school, five of them Hispanic, over a thousand people in the school
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:18:00.240]  and most of them weren't even there wearing American flags because it was Cinco de Mayo.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.440]  American flag shirts are popular one was an old Navy shirt and the illegal aliens in
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:14.160]  the school in the sanctuary city were so offended by the American flag in America that the students
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.180]  were sent home and then there's video of other students driving around days later with American
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:25.720]  flags flying from their cars and the illegals cussing at them yelling at them starting
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:29.960]  fights with them because I mean here's an example.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.520]  There was a national cartoon that guys print this for me.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.880]  I think I am to do you.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.000]  I haven't seen it my stack.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.840]  Maybe it's here.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:45.800]  There was a national cartoon showing the Mexican eagle on the Mexican flag shot by drug gangs
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:51.840]  laying dead with bullet holes in it and the national government of Mexico has gotten angry
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.960]  and is complaining about it.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.920]  They're not worried about tens of thousands dying every year.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.960]  They're not worried about their country collapsing.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:04.480]  It's that nationalism of you don't, which wasn't even about Mexico or the flag itself
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.480]  being bad.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:11.600]  The country is being killed by the drug war and they're demanding that this cartoon not
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.680]  be run.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.440]  We're being intimidated.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:21.160]  You know that's why I supported a few months ago artists worldwide doing cartoons about
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:26.360]  Islam because they've been threatened with death if they do and if we give into that
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.320]  mafia threat that's the end of free speech.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.680]  Don't you understand the globalists bring in all these foreigners.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.440]  They bring in all these diverse groups.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:37.920]  They hype us all up to hate each other and then the globalists play the part of the referee
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.360]  over all of this and say, well, so that there's peace with everyone, you don't have any free
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.240]  speech any of you.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.280]  Or they selectively allow certain groups to have free speech, but others can.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.480]  So I'll wear an American flag if I want.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.480]  Okay?
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.000]  You don't like it leave.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.920]  And if you don't like somebody's right to burn a Bible, an American flag, or a Koran,
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.600]  get out of the country.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.840]  Go back to Saudi Arabia.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:04.480]  So you've got your emergency food, water, guns and ammo, right?
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.840]  What about your paperwork?
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:10.960]  Your medical and insurance records, legal documents, emergency plans, keeping and knowing
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.880]  where those vital papers are can really prepare you.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.360]  That's why you need prepared binder.

[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.520]  Eventually you will ask yourself, is gold right for me?
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.960]  The answer might surprise you.

[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.120]  Is your home insured?
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.440]  Do you carry life insurance?
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.960]  How about financial insurance?
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.960]  If you own gold, then the answer is yes.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:23.640]  If you don't own gold, the question is why don't you have financial insurance?
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.720]  We put our faith in things we trust.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.920]  Do you trust the dollar?

[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.880]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.280]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.800]  A similar audacity called GMO or genetically modified organisms means that the quality
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.880]  of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:18.280]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.480]  in wild, edible food?

[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  you look.

[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:34.200]  yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food too.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:37.840]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.440]  foods aren't involved.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.280]  Our foods are their enemy.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:47.200]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.

[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:10.440]  Okay, Richard Gage coming up with Keybreaking 9-11 News.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.720]  Here's the CNN story.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.040]  They even get it right on this issue.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.480]  Get real, Mexico.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.280]  It's just a cartoon.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.280]  And it goes on.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:25.120]  I realize this might be an imprudent question leading up to September 16th, Mexican Independence
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.000]  Day.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.760]  But what in the world is the matter with Mexico?
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:35.040]  Here you have a drug war that has caused the deaths of more than 28,000 Mexicans with
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.400]  the resulting loss of billions of dollars in terrorism and foreign investment in the
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:43.320]  economy already in distress, drug gangs terrorizing the population, schoolchildren being taught
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.400]  to duck and cover under their desk in the advent of gunfire, the corrupt and discredited
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:52.320]  institutional revolutionary party making a comeback thanks to voter discontent over the
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.400]  war, and dire warnings from international organizations about how the whole country
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:05.040]  could be on the brink of collapse, and what offends the sensibilities of Mexicans a cartoon.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:11.160]  American cartoonist Daryl Cagle recently came under fire south of the border after drawing
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.760]  a Mexican flag with a provocative twist.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:18.280]  The flag is supposed to feature an eagle perched on a cactus devouring a snake.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.480]  In Cagle's rendition, the eagle lies in the center riddled with bullet holes and a pool
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.480]  of blood.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:27.720]  Cagle said his drawing, which went out to more than 800 newspapers around the world
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.960]  and has been published in at least two newspapers in Mexico, was intended to draw attention to
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.040]  the horrible violence in the country.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:37.800]  Instead, the imagery unleashed furious anger.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.240]  The Mexican newspaper El Universal, which ran the cartoon, heard complaints from many
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.240]  readers.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.240]  It's a shame, said one.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:49.040]  This, a patriotic symbol like our flag, which is so beautiful to me, can be mocked by a
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.200]  stupid cartoonist, even the Mexican Embassy in Washington, which must not have had more
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:59.080]  important matters to deal with gotten to the act, criticizing it.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.720]  They went on to say they respected defend free speech and freedom of expression in any way
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.600]  it's manifested, but regarding the case of Mr. Cagle's cartoon, we differ on the use
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:11.600]  he makes of the Mexican flag and the message it conveys.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.160]  And it goes on from there.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.720]  So you can't wear American flags.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:20.240]  The 30 million Mexicans here in the U.S., large portions are threatened by it.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.760]  You've had illegals come out of the public schools all over the country, go to police
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:31.360]  stations, fire stations, post offices, private businesses, and pull down American flags.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.120]  Stomp on them.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.840]  And if you criticize it, you're bad.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:38.680]  It's my first amendment to say I think that's wrong and shows a hatred of this country.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.840]  And look, I don't care what color you are.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.560]  I want to live in peace with everybody.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:49.040]  But if you are so offended by the American flag that you're pulling it down at post offices,
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.760]  you're so offended by it that you don't want people wearing it at public school.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.840]  You're so offended by it, a cartoonist can't show that Mexico is in deep trouble.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:03.080]  I mean, how many cartoons have you seen making fun of the American Eagle as a symbol of the
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.080]  federal government?
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.640]  It's constant.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:09.000]  That's what freedom of expression and speech is about.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.360]  And either you support it, I mean, I don't like these reports of Muslims in the West
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.320]  Bank burning the Bible.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.320]  It's disrespectful.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.320]  It's hateful.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.720]  But it's their right to do it.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:23.920]  And if they start burning Bibles here in the United States, I don't like it.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.080]  But it's their right to do it.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:32.800]  But to threaten to kill this pastor is the opposite of what this country was founded on.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:43.000]  And I will defend that preacher's right until I'm dead to burn the Koran because it's his
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.320]  right to do it as an American with the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.520]  He has that right even though it's distasteful.
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.080]  And I think it's disgusting.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.760]  I have a right to say it's disgusting.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:04.680]  And I think it's going to... The Pentagon is upset about this because it will illustrate
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:08.480]  what many of the tribes have already been taught, that this is a war against Islam,
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.480]  that we are over there.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:12.440]  That's what they're taught in these different speeches the generals give them.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.440]  That's what comes out.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:20.040]  They promote a kind of fake Christianoid idea over there, that they're part of some holy
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.920]  war against Islam.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.200]  So let's just be honest about it.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.720]  And this illustrates what people really feel.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:31.440]  If you don't want our tribes being killed, pull them out of Iraq, pull them out of Afghanistan.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.440]  And then if Muslims don't want to support free speech, well then we don't have these
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.640]  massive numbers of people immigrating here.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.760]  You never hear a discussion or a debate about that.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.560]  If people don't like the American flag, don't immigrate here.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.960]  If you don't like free speech, don't immigrate here.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.960]  But at the same time, we shouldn't be over in their countries.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.960]  We shouldn't be running around inside their nations.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.280]  I mean, if you imagine how much they hate us, you know, we're all talking about how they
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.040]  want to blow us up and be terrorist over here.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.640]  Since the 50s, our government's been overthrowing governments over there, mainly secular governments
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:08.000]  that want to be our friends.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.120]  The globalists don't want that.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.680]  They want a bunch of crazed, extremist running things.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.880]  We're going to come back, talk to Richard Gage, and then folks, the police state news
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.240]  I've got the third hour after we take calls is off the charts.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.240]  It's off the hook.
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:29.160]  Look at this, victims of extraordinary rendition that's kidnapping cannot sue U.S. court rules.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.080]  They're also announcing when I told you they do seven years ago, because Homeland Security
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:36.640]  said that was the plan, they're going to have random checkpoints all over America, strip
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.800]  searching you body scanners bathing you in radiation.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:40.960]  We've got to say no to this.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.960]  It's about training you to live in a total police state.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:51.000]  And even NBC admits that the headlines police state will be right back.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.720]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:30:00.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.960]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:09.280]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:13.600]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.920]  allows you to have.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:15.920]  It's true.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:20.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.960]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:28.960]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:32.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:36.160]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.920]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.920]  folks.
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.760]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:46.080]  my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:52.040]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:59.960]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:03.080]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:07.040]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.800]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:15.200]  You need to get your own supply of high quality, storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.120]  food to choose from.
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:25.080]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis, not some old, cruddy food they're selling
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.800]  you like some of the other guys.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:31.240]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two week supply of delicious, easy to fix food.
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:35.160]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:39.840]  Iran the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.960]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.360]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:31:52.080 --> 01:32:00.400]  Again on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:07.080]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:12.280]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:20.840]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:28.040]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:34.040]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:45.800]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:50.360]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.520]  ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.440]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:05.800]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:11.960]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:17.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.760]  Richard Gage with Big Breaking News dealing with 9-11.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:24.720]  They had a press conference at the National Press Club yesterday that actually made it
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.880]  into a whole bunch of mainstream news.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:31.640]  This is important information coming up on the ninth anniversary of the tragic attacks.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:38.520]  While we're getting Richard Gage on the line, I wanted to go back because with a quick search,
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:46.280]  we found the cartoon that Mexico's so angry about showing the Mexican Eagles shot by the
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.960]  drug gangs dead on the ground.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:54.080]  We found another cartoon making fun of the American Eagle, the bald eagle, not the gold
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.520]  eagle in a cage.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.200]  It says national debt.
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.360]  The American Eagle today is in a cage.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:04.280]  He's enslaved to debt.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:08.600]  And you've got the drug gangs destroying Mexico in the fake drug war run by the globalist
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.000]  on record.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.160]  And not only do I support free speech, I agree with both these cartoons.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.520]  It makes perfect sense.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:20.160]  It makes absolute sense.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:24.040]  I want to just let listeners know, again, that we are listeners supported by supporting
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:30.440]  our sponsors and by visiting the online video bookstore at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:35.080]  You can also be a prisonplanet.tv member for 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, the cost
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.560]  of two Starbucks coffees.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.840]  You can download all my films in the highest quality, watch the live video stream of the
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:46.600]  show, expanded extras, being a prisonplanet.tv member, stuff that didn't even on the films
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.960]  or in the DVD extras is at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:54.200]  My book, Paul Watson's book, and a lot more of things that are out of print are available
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.520]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:59.320]  We've had a lot of listeners ask for something we haven't done in years.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.200]  And that's signed limited edition films and books.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.240]  We've got a whole section on that now at infowars.com.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.400]  And the other special that we're running, until it runs out, we've only got, actually,
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.400]  they corrected me.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.000]  We don't have 2,000 of this book.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:21.640]  We have about 1,200 of Jesse Ventura's hardcover American conspiracies, powerful read.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:24.960]  It covers 14 different subjects.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:27.920]  It's so informative, a great gift to give people.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.400]  You can get the Obama deception for 1995, the pivotal film, key tool to wake folks up,
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:40.960]  and get a free Jesse Ventura American conspiracies book, $24.95 value.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:46.520]  So the film and the book for 1995 until the books run out.
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:48.080]  And that could be days or weeks.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.080]  We don't know.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:54.240]  The other specials just absolutely sold out eight different films that we were offering
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:56.040]  total in the five video special.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:59.920]  And as each film would run out, we'd add a new film to the five combo pack for 1995.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:08.240]  We've got a bunch of other specials, infowars.com, where you can simply call toll free 888-253-3139
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:13.400]  or write to me PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas 787-04.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:17.760]  And even if we sell out of these, and you write us a letter, we hold back a few hundred
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:23.280]  of specials to fill mail orders as long as it's post dated while the special is running.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.320]  So again, those are different ways to support us, but most importantly, these books and
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:31.400]  films are waking people up big time, and then this radio show is a growing international
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:36.020]  platform to bring on different guests and organizations and groups that are on the front
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:39.480]  lines of fighting for free humanity.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:47.400]  Now here's the PR Newswire report up on infowars.com, 1270 architects engineers reveal hard evidence
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:51.960]  of explosive demolition at World Trade Center on 9-11.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.680]  And the Sun Herald, Forbes, Yahoo, Brett Barton, others did report on the big press conference
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:00.480]  and the breaking incredible information.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:05.200]  A lot of new 9-11 info coming out, we can just add to the huge stack of proof that the
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.240]  official story is a complete hoax and a lie.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:13.760]  And now the founder, well over 1200 members of architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth,
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.560]  Richard Gage joins us to recap this breaking information and give us even more intel on
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:20.560]  what's been coming out.
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:22.160]  Richard, good to have you here with us.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.160]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.680]  It's great to be here with you, always an honor.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.240]  Well, you've got the floor in the remainder of the hour.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:31.800]  Tell us about this breaking info and why it's so important.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:37.040]  On top of the new NIST footage that was forced to be released with lawsuits on the National
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:40.840]  Standards Group that again shows Building 7 being blown up.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:41.840]  Go ahead.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:48.000]  Well, indeed, Building 7 is the smoking gun of 9-11.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.600]  The evidence is clear that all three World Trade Center highrises, excuse me, were brought
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:01.440]  down by explosive demolition and we now have almost 1,280 architects signed on to our petition
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.000]  demanding a new investigation.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:11.520]  We were yesterday at 2 p.m. at the National Press Club presenting all of this evidence.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.160]  Well, much of it in the first 10 minutes at the press conference.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:25.160]  We follow that immediately with a mock debate where we took statements from about 10 supporters
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:31.840]  of the official story, including Shyam Sunder and John Gross of NIST and the guys from Popular
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:38.840]  Mechanics and Michael Schirmer and a host of other supporters, Bazant and David Thomas,
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:42.160]  who we've been in debates with.
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:48.400]  We used their statements, publicly made statements, in this press conference to tick off from
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:55.160]  and present these points of evidence because they were not willing to come and debate with
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.760]  us publicly at the press club.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:03.680]  We presented their statements for them and Senator Mike Ravel was with us at the press
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:10.080]  conference in debate and he presented a very, very powerful plea for an investigation and
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:16.880]  support of the family members of the victims of 9-11 who are calling, many of whom are
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:22.400]  calling upon us, the architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, to get to the truth, to get
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:26.000]  to the evidence and that's what we've been doing and that's what we presented.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:33.120]  We presented the evidence of explosive nanothermite composite materials found in the dust samples
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.360]  throughout the lower Manhattan, landed like a blanket four to 12 inches thick.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:47.240]  This is a very, very high-tech material, explosives found in the dust, completely ignored and
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:53.800]  in fact, they denied that they found any evidence, and later they acknowledged that they never
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.800]  looked for it.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.840]  Now, they will not look for it even though it's been documented in a 25-page, pure viewed
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:04.480]  paper on the Bentham Open Chemical Physics Journal, uncontested for the last year and
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:05.640]  a half.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.840]  Not only do we find the evidence of these chips, the small red-gray chips of nanocomposite
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:19.880]  materials but the results of that fairly explosive material, which is the iron microspheres, billions
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:27.120]  of them found in all the world-trades interdust previously, molten iron microspheres, 6% of
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.560]  the weight of these dust samples in many cases are composed of these.
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:36.640]  So, this is evidence that they sustained temperatures exceeding the melting point of iron, which
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:42.920]  is 2,800 degrees, but office fires and jet fuel only get to be about half that temperature.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.960]  So, you've got this now from hundreds of sources from all the different buildings and
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:53.160]  apartments and the different groups that have records of this and from memorials.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:57.560]  I mean, this is now the evidence chain over and over again confirmed.
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:58.560]  Oh, yeah.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.560]  There's no question.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:03.360]  They can't fight it.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:09.160]  It's completely an airtight, solid case and not only with that, but even the evidence
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:15.240]  that NIST FEMA came up with in their appendix C, the documentation that these steel girders
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.440]  were looked like Swiss cheese that are melted and other stuff.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:25.920]  And we have the firefighters on video on national TV saying there was molten iron like a foundry,
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:32.920]  like a volcano, molten and we have the NASA photos weeks later, thousands of degrees way
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.280]  above jet fuel.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:39.720]  I mean, they used something in there that had molten slag three, four weeks later.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:40.720]  Absolutely.
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:46.120]  And there's documentation of that in videos and photos in addition to the dozens of witnesses
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.480]  seeing all this molten metal running.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:54.560]  And it's clearly molten iron tests have been done on it by physicists.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:58.920]  It's not melted copper or aluminum or something like that.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:04.120]  This is several tons of it underneath all three World Trade Center high rises, reminding
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:10.240]  your listeners that there was a third skyscraper, 47 stories tall, building seven, which dropped
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:15.920]  in six and a half seconds straight down uniformly suddenly and a three fall acceleration into
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.800]  its own footprint.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:22.440]  And this is like a house of cards, a pile of four stories tall.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.560]  This is clearly a controlled demolition.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:28.600]  When we show the architects and engineers about this as we did in the press conference
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:37.240]  last night, it dropped their jaws as well because they know that's a controlled demolition.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.240]  Everybody does.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.240]  This is intuitive.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:43.760]  A building can't fall at free fall acceleration and crush anything on the way down.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:47.640]  If it's going to do work like crushing columns, it's got to slow down.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:53.040]  And this even acknowledged that this was a free fall acceleration.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:43:00.080]  So it's unbelievable all the evidence that lines up for the explosive controlled demolition
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.640]  in CNN was there with their cameras at the press conference in Washington, DC, the National
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.080]  Press Club.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:11.520]  And we're hoping that they have the courage to put this on the air.
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.360]  We've got coverage in Utica, New York from one of our 60 press conferences that were
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:19.440]  held concurrently around the world.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.240]  Utica, New York has it on TV.
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:24.120]  Phoenix had it on TV today.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.760]  So we'll find out who else has the courage to expose the crime of this entry.
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.640]  Well, the point is you're gaining ground.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.560]  More and more evidence is piling up, confirming the previous evidence.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.440]  And this is one small spectrum of the evidence.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:44.400]  You've got CNN and BBC reporting building seven had fallen an hour and then 25 minutes
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:49.320]  before and giving the away it officially did fall later.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.320]  So they were right.
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.400]  I said they were clearly fed some type of newsfeed and that the government jumped the
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:59.200]  gun with kind of a false start and later the BBC admitted Reuters gave them an internal
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:05.160]  report about building seven falling from fires more than an hour before it fell.
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:08.160]  But they went with it 25 minutes before it fell.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.280]  You have the police saying get back.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:16.640]  They're bringing down building seven on CNN and it is being reported that we've got Brett
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:25.120]  Bart, Sun Harold, Forbes, Yahoo and others in print media are reporting on this information
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.120]  now.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:29.160]  So you're really breaking through that electronic Berlin wall.
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:34.120]  And when people actually look at the evidence, they find out the official story is a fairytale.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:42.720]  And we took this evidence in our DVDs and brochures and our new newspaper, the 911 investigator.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:50.640]  We took all this information to every office of Congress in the last two days prior to
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.280]  the press conference.
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.520]  We handed it to staffers.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.640]  We have many conversations in fact appointments where we sat down with 20 minutes and showed
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.240]  building seven coming down and the Twin Towers coming down to these staffers and science
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:11.120]  advisors and we did deliver packets to all 541 congressional offices and we have a few
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.880]  more to go to follow up this week.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:19.800]  But they have the information and they're going to be held accountable, our Congress
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.640]  persons, by their constituents.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:27.920]  We have supporters of course in the 911 truth movement all throughout and in every congressional
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.360]  office and we're going to be having them do the follow up for us directly with their
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:33.360]  local offices.
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:37.600]  It's a political activity as well trying to get an investigation.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:42.240]  That's the mission of the 911 truth, a real investigation that accounts for the evidence
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:50.640]  of thermite, nanothermite, free-falling buildings, very explosive information that they had evidence
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.080]  that has to be gotten into the public record.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:57.960]  They're just not going to be able to run away from it for very much longer.
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:03.200]  Richard, I think they're trying to overshadow your research, Dr. Jones' research, my work
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:08.200]  and many others that are out there taking action and the fact that polls show globally
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:13.400]  not just in the U.S. but more and more statistically people are not buying the official fable that
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:17.760]  was the pretext for the wars, the domestic takeover, the naked body scanners, all of
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:18.920]  it.
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:25.080]  But I think you've got this Rockefeller-funded Fox News owner-funded mosque.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:29.200]  I don't think the E-moms bad, but he's clearly a globalist, goes to the Davos forums.
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:36.480]  You've got this Christian Zionist type church out in Florida that is wanting to burn the
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.480]  Koran.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:43.040]  Whereas I support the free speech rights and the property rights of the mosque builders
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:47.040]  and I support this preacher's right to the First Amendment to burn the Koran.
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.160]  I don't like it, but I have to support his right.
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:58.000]  From line, I see the media hyping this to create a clash of civilizations ahead of an
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  Iran strike.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.400]  I mean, this is perfect timing to kind of re-invoke 9-11 and Muslims and Christians at
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.680]  each other's throats.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.120]  And so that's why it's so important that you're doing this and other people are doing this
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:14.320]  right now and they've got the TV ad running very successfully in New York with the victim's
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:18.480]  families calling for a new investigation and talking about building seven.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:24.200]  So it's great to see real patriots who love truth on the offensive as a counter-offensive.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:28.560]  Do you agree that all this mosque stuff and burn the Koran stuff looks pretty suspicious
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.560]  right now?
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:34.480]  Oh yeah, but in addition, what we're doing is we're having a press conference for that
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:39.800]  reason right in front of the new building seven at the corner of Vesti and Grenin
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.800]  streets.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:48.120]  The conference tomorrow, Saturday at 2 p.m., in order to, and we're getting this press
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:55.000]  advisory out today to, I don't know, a hundred media outlets inside of New York.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:03.120]  So we can have them come and listen to the family members decry this non-issue so we
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:06.560]  can get to the real issue, which is the explosive demolition of the...
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:07.560]  That's right.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.560]  The surviving...
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.560]  The surviving firefighters, police, medical workers, the families, surviving victims,
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.040]  they've already been out and had press conferences and I'm glad you're having another one saying,
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:21.640]  look, we don't want to hear about the mosque, we want the health care, we've been denied,
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:23.440]  and we want a new investigation.
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.440]  Yes, building seven and the Twin Towers controlled demolition.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:30.680]  I mean, this is the story of the century, don't you think?
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:35.760]  It is out some enterprising journalist could break this story and get it published and
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:38.840]  take all the credit for all the work we've been doing for nine years.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:39.840]  Well, that's right.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:48.320]  The media really doesn't want the families and the victims and the families' victims.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:51.080]  I mean, they don't want them to be seen out there.
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.280]  They want to use the pain of 9-11 as the pretext for more war and control and they want to
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.800]  speak for the families of the victims.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:48:59.800]  But we...
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:03.200]  So that's why it's important people actually hear the families themselves.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:08.600]  And those families will be there at the press conference calling upon 1,270 architects and
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:14.360]  engineers to investigate the evidence which points to the real cause of the death of their
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.360]  family members.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:23.320]  So we're happy to be supportive technically to that pursuit of justice and truth.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:30.520]  And that's tomorrow in front of the new building seven, Larry Silverstein's building at 2 o'clock.
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:31.520]  That's right.
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.360]  Now, we're going to break in a moment and come back with the final segment with Richard
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.360]  Gage.
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.960]  But Richard, get back into this new evidence.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:41.480]  I mean, you guys have been able to really triple confirm all this and why this press
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.280]  conference yesterday was so important.
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:51.040]  Well, these microspheres, the iron microspheres are endemic in all of the Web Trade Center
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.040]  dust.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:57.160]  And in fact, USGS found them and documented them first and other environmental firms like
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.640]  RJ Lee.
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:05.680]  These previously molten iron microspheres comprise 6% of the dust, in some cases, found
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.560]  on top of the Deutsche Bank building everywhere, really.
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:15.200]  And by the way, they say, supporters of the official story will say, oh, that's just from
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.920]  the cleanup equipment and the welding and so forth.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:18.920]  No.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:22.080]  These are up on top of the high rises.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:27.360]  They're collected even in some samples, 10 minutes on the Brooklyn Bridge, a sample was
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:32.640]  collected within 10 minutes of the collapse of the towers.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.880]  So no, these are not polluted and it's documented very well by official sources.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:43.080]  These have the evidence in them, the chemical evidence, of thermite, including aluminum,
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:52.720]  iron, oxygen, silica, other very, very clear chemical fingerprints of thermite.
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.080]  All right, Richard Gage.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.080]  Stay there.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:01.240]  We'll segment straight ahead in the news blitz and your phone calls.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:06.480]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:07.480]  company?
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:08.480]  Don't.
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:11.400]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.240]  Herb Kay was right.
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:39.400]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:40.840]  What do you have to lose?

[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:02.120]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:06.080]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:07.720]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:11.760]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:12.760]  or gold?
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:16.040]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:18.280]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:22.440]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.440]  seeds.
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:28.720]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:30.600]  food for you and your family.
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:31.600]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:35.920]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:38.400]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:41.640]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:48.480]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:52.600]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:57.480]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:54:05.720]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:09.920]  Why is 9-Eleven Truth so important?
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:15.440]  It is the pretext for the wars, the destruction of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:19.840]  It is the pretext for the dismantling of our republic.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:27.000]  And I've got the head of Homeland Security, Napolitano, saying another 9-Eleven is coming.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.640]  So they're out there hyping that and they've got to take your rights, take your freedoms,
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:35.040]  and enslave you to keep you safe from the Muslims.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:39.720]  Meanwhile, they do everything they can to stir up the Muslims by invading their countries,
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:42.040]  lying about WMDs.
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:45.440]  And the Pentagon knows this is stirring them up.
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:49.120]  You, the citizen of this nation, you are the target.
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:53.040]  The West is the target of the New World Order.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:56.480]  And that's why it's so exciting what Richard Gage is doing.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:02.480]  Richard, more dealing with the press conference at the National Press Club, I would imagine
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:06.040]  the people that really carried out these attacks are starting to really get concerned.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:10.400]  I hope so, they should be.
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.600]  Americans are waking up.
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:17.960]  It's a whole different story now, thanks to you, your listeners who are out there in
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:23.280]  the streets raising awareness on the 11th of every month.
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:26.160]  People are giving away DVDs.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:34.320]  The people who are accepting these or are being confronted with this information in
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.240]  the streets are more receptive.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:43.160]  There isn't so much greater receptivity this year compared to five years ago.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:44.160]  It's an awakening.
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:51.560]  It's just really quite incredible, and we're delighted to be part of that, because we can
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:52.560]  be used.
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.600]  The Architects and Engineers for International Truth have produced a lot of material researched
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:02.840]  by others, like Dr. Stephen Jones, and Neil Harrett, and many others who have done the
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:08.400]  work well before us, you of course, from the very beginning and even before, but Dr. David
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:16.080]  Ray Griffin, who came along, got his message and books out there on the radio, which worked
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.040]  me up about four years ago.
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:20.680]  I knew nothing as a Reagan Republican.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:28.640]  I was a regular architect, and all of a sudden, I'm being hit over the head with a 2x4 that
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.640]  reality is different.
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.040]  It's not the same.
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:36.800]  I'm not living in the same country all of a sudden that I was, because if 9-11 was some
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:42.880]  sort of an inside operation, that changed everything, and I realized I had to... I
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:43.880]  looked around.
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:48.480]  We're the Architects and Engineers who are talking about this, and there were almost
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:49.480]  none.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:56.840]  Now, we've got 1,280 of them on our petition, and many more that have become aware that
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:03.080]  won't for unfortunate reasons like they don't want to be discriminated against or lose their
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:04.080]  job or something.
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:11.240]  They won't sign our petition, but the means of Americans are waking up to this.
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:15.760]  Well, Richard, we salute your courage, and we salute the other architects and engineers
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:20.400]  and physicists and the peer-reviewed journals for their courage, and it's simple.
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.320]  You're faced with a lie this big.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.040]  If you buy into it, if you submit to this lie, then they'll tell you DU it ain't bad
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.240]  for you when they know it's killing people en masse.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:32.520]  They'll body scan you with radiation and say they're not recording the images and get
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:33.520]  caught lying.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:39.200]  I mean, the point is clearly this isn't freedom that's being foisted on us, and it has nothing
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:41.520]  to do with keeping us safe from terrorists.
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:44.800]  This is what's happened to every other third-world country where its own military-industrial
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:48.520]  complex takes it over in the name of keeping people safe.
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:54.440]  It's just a 21st-century, more sophisticated version of it, and free humanity is challenging
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.080]  this lie on every front.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:01.000]  I hope folks will go to the press conference tomorrow, 2 p.m. Eastern Time, there at Building
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.600]  7, the new Building 7 at Ground Zero and be part of that and support the families of the
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:09.480]  victims and the firefighters and police and others that are going to be there with you.
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:14.240]  I look forward to having you on next week to give us a quick report on the aftermath
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:18.600]  of this weekend as well as Luke Radowski and others from New York and other vigils and
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.360]  demonstrations that are being held, not just in the United States and every major city
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:23.360]  but worldwide.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:25.880]  Richard Gage, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:29.200]  Fire out quickly the website for Architects and Engineers 9-11 Truth.

[01:59:53.640 --> 02:00:05.560]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:10.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.360]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.560]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:22.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:26.160]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:29.880]  I'm going to take phone calls in the next segment, in the segment after that, then I'm
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.000]  going to blitz through news and then get to as many calls as I can.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:41.920]  But any issue you want to discuss, any news item, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:48.000]  on the September 10th, 2010 edition, one day short of nine years since the tragic attacks
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.520]  of 9-11-2001.
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:50.520]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:01:00.560]  Obviously, you're welcome to call in about the mosque, the burn the Quran business, all
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.560]  the rest of it.
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:06.520]  I've got a lot of other news that this other stuff has been distracting from that I want
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:08.240]  to go over.
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:12.240]  Here's a brief scan of what's coming up.
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:18.840]  This is all linked up at infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and also gcnlive.com.
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:22.080]  Random pat-downs turn pat-coe into police state.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.440]  This is from NBC News.
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:28.640]  I'll give you a document cam shot for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:32.840]  Random pat-downs turn pat-coe into police state.
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:36.080]  Commuters clothing, pockets, bags, and vehicles to be randomly searched.
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.800]  The police go on to say you have no rights in the article.
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:41.160]  So the government's just letting you know it's a police state now.
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:45.920]  TSA plans to use Homeboy, Ball Cap Avatar on naked body scanners.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:52.280]  They'll show you a computer-generated image of your body scan that's covered with clothes,
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.280]  but they're still getting the real scans, saving it and looking at that.
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:57.680]  They're lying to you.
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:00.120]  And this doesn't mention the radiation danger.
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:01.120]  They're in deep trouble.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:02.720]  There is massive resistance forming.
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:07.240]  We can beat this if we continue to point out that A, they're recording it lying about
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:08.240]  it.
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:09.560]  B, they can see your real naked body.
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:12.040]  And C, there's the radiation.
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:14.280]  So that is coming up.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:18.920]  Also Toronto Public Works Protection Act continues long at the G20 summit.
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:22.600]  They claim that they suspended Canadians' rights for the G20 meeting, and they're going
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.080]  on afterwards to say they have no rights.
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:30.520]  This is usual, Fed court slaps down torture lawsuit against CIA.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:32.640]  That's not just Kurt Nemo's take on it.
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:34.600]  Here's the London Independent.
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:38.200]  Victims of extraordinary rendition cannot sue.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:39.200]  You have no rights.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.920]  You're allowed to be secretly arrested, tortured, killed, anything.
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:43.480]  The government's just completely criminal.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.880]  Yeah, well, courts can say blacks aren't human, but they still are and still have rights to
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:48.880]  fight back.
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:51.480]  You know, we've had the Supreme Court rule, blacks aren't humans before.
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:52.480]  Does that mean it's true?
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:57.080]  The UN blueprint, dismantle middle class build world government, incredible report by Paul
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:01.000]  Joseph Watson, where they admit, get rid of the middle class, the carbon taxes are to
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.320]  shut down industrial society.
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:12.200]  An amazing story out of the South Yorkshire newspaper, The Star, ringtone race row, means
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:16.560]  fight, lands fan in a cell.
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:19.080]  He put a clip of a famous movie as his ringtone.
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:23.520]  It has the word Paki in it, where the Pakistan guy goes, Hey, I'm a Paki.
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:25.520]  I guess that's some kind of, you can't call Pakistan.
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:26.520]  He's a Paki.
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:29.560]  I mean, everything's turned into a racial term.
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:31.040]  And so he's been arrested.
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:32.040]  You are arrested.
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:35.640]  Remember Robin Page, BBC presenter?
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:39.240]  He said rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and gays.
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:42.360]  He was arrested for saying he deserves rights.
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:44.800]  You can't even say you want rights.
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:45.800]  You're arrested.
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.520]  England is a high tech hardcore police state.
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:54.280]  It is so vicious and Canada's turning into that as well.
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:59.520]  And we are too, if they're able to ban burning this Koran or ban that mosque being built,
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:01.440]  because you'll lose your property rights.
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:02.720]  You'll lose your free speech rights.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:03.720]  You'll lose everything.
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:04.720]  And that's what's being done.
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:10.280]  They bring in all the foreigners, stir them up and then take everybody's rights.
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:11.880]  That's what multiculturalism is.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:12.880]  Here's another one.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:17.400]  Most of us want list of patients using painkillers.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:21.120]  Everyone's name, who's ever been given a prescription, the feds already have this.
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:24.200]  Now local police want to know your entire medical records, get away with whatever they
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:25.200]  want.
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:26.200]  Incredible.
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:30.600]  So that is just some of what's coming up in the police state stack.
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:33.400]  We'll also get into the economy.
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:37.520]  Been telling you about bisphenol A. Here is the male.
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.600]  Gender bending chemicals in our rivers grow more potent.
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:45.480]  To where the fish, the eels, the amphibians, they're hemaphrodites.
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:48.160]  And basically that's what we're being turned into.
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:51.480]  This is being added, ladies and gentlemen, by design.
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:54.000]  It's all coming up on the other side of this break.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:00.520]  But first, Shannon, Eli, Wilson, Tyler, John, you're called straight ahead.
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:01.520]  Hello friends.
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:02.520]  This is Alex Jones.

[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:09.840]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find

[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:29.520]  Since 1947, Calvin soap company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and

[02:05:58.960 --> 02:06:00.120]  Thank you.
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.760]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:04.760]  generator.
[02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:08.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:13.480]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:14.760]  allows you to have.
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:20.480]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:24.800]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:28.800]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:32.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.720]  Number five, a solar powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:44.520]  Folks, I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:45.920]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:50.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:51.720]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:59.720]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:02.920]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:06.880]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:09.640]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:15.040]  You need to get your own supply of high quality, storeable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:19.480]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:20.960]  food to choose from.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:23.360]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis.
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:26.640]  Not some old, cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:31.120]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two week supply of delicious, easy to fix food.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:35.040]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:39.680]  Iran the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:41.800]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:44.200]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:07:51.920 --> 02:08:04.120]  Again, on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:12.640]  Defending the Republic from enemies born in domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:14.280]  We are back live.
[02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:18.240]  Thank you so much for joining us on the September 10th live Friday edition.
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:23.560]  Let's go straight to your phone calls, massive news blitz coming up, including this key story
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:25.600]  by Steve Watson just down.
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:30.000]  We had Ron Paul on two weeks ago, and he hinted that he might run for president, but now he
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:35.280]  said that the American people are probably ready, and I'm going to tell you right now
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:36.720]  he's going to run.
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:41.760]  I know his character, I understand the politics involved, but now he's basically saying it's
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:47.520]  probably going to happen, especially because Rand has pushed his lead from eight points
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:50.080]  to over 15 in every major poll.
[02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:52.440]  That's another symbol.
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:53.440]  This is incredible.
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:57.200]  They've thrown the kitchen sink at Rand, lying about him, and it blew up in their face.
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:02.840]  The mainstream media spin machine and slander machine is officially dead, as Watson said
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:05.960]  a few days ago in his article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:08.280]  So that's coming up as well.
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:11.000]  Amazing statements from Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  Shannon in Mississippi, you're on the air.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  Hey, Alex.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  How are you doing?
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:22.720]  Alex, I wanted to get on that subject about this pasture in Gainesville, Florida.
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:24.680]  I believe it's his right.
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:30.720]  I'm a United States Air Force veteran security police officer, and the first thing I had
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:35.600]  to swear on was to defend the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:39.880]  The United States Constitution says he has the freedom to do whatever he wants, including
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:40.880]  burning up a Korean.
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:44.600]  And our media is openly saying, I've got USA Today.
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:45.600]  Should he be stopped?
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.680]  If they don't let him do it and tell him not to, then this country is dead.
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:53.480]  This country is dead if they do not let him do it.
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:58.480]  Now this slime ball on TV, hard ball, I call him slime ball just like you do, he gets on
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:04.920]  TV and he shows them people in Afghanistan burning the American flag, burning an infantry
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:07.360]  of this pasture.
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:09.080]  And then he says, look what they're doing.
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.240]  They're throwing rocks at our tanks and stuff.
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:16.760]  Well, they need to get out of Afghanistan and let the United States be free with their
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:17.760]  Constitution.
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:24.120]  And if it's not all right for that man to burn the Korean, then people need to go back
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:31.560]  to their own country or state and the United States and carry and fly our flag and believe
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:34.080]  in freedom of speech and liberty.
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.440]  Well, I couldn't say it any better or more succinctly.
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:39.120]  Shannon, I mean, that's it.
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:40.120]  Anything else?
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:42.640]  No, sir, Alex, that is it.
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:49.680]  I just want everybody to protect the United States and get these foam out of office, Alex,
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:51.560]  and I salute you and your crew.
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:52.560]  Thank you, sir.
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:53.560]  I salute you, Shannon.
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:57.680]  And again, I don't like people who burn American flags, burn Bibles or burn Koreans.
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:10:59.080]  I think it's disrespectful.
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:04.680]  But if they can take, what did Europe do in the last 30 years from France to Germany?
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:07.080]  They banned white supremacists.
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:11.400]  And then now they banned criticizing the government in many areas.
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:16.520]  They banned saying, you know, I don't want my children being taught sex education.
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:18.040]  They arrest you.
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:19.240]  I've got that in the news stack.
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:21.000]  I'm going to be covering it.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:26.360]  You understand, folks, that if you support taking that pastor's right and give in to
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:28.520]  this intimidation, it's over.
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:32.520]  And look, I don't like what the pastor's doing, but I begin to understand why he's doing
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:33.520]  it.
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:36.960]  He's saying these people are not tolerant like they claim they are.
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:41.040]  They are not compatible with our country, okay?
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:46.160]  And if they kill him or try to kill him or the government tries to stop him from doing
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:49.760]  it, then it's over.
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:50.760]  It's over.
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:51.920]  And look, this whole thing's contrived.
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:56.560]  The media hyping at the mosque thing, again, you can't have it both ways.
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:00.760]  You have to say they have a right to build that mosque even if you disagree with it religiously.
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.600]  Even if you think the official story 9-11 is true and Muslims did it, you have to support
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:05.800]  that or America's dead.
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:10.400]  Well, I mean, I hope Muslims can get into the show today or tomorrow or on Sunday when
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:16.400]  I'm live to explain to me, you can have the mosque and other people can burn them bibles,
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:17.480]  but you can't burn a Quran.
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:20.040]  I mean, either we have this or we don't.
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:23.320]  You have a right to criticize that pastor.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:25.800]  Let's talk to Ellie in North Carolina.
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:26.800]  You're on the air, Ellie.
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:27.800]  Okay.
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:32.720]  There's a lot happening on a lot of fronts, but I wouldn't minimize what happened to that
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:37.480]  student that was sent home for wearing an American flag t-shirt.
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:43.240]  And I would say that every kid in that school should turn up, the whole school should turn
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:46.440]  up, unmasked, wearing an American flag.
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:47.440]  Exactly.
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:52.040]  We've been taught, don't talk about politics, religion, shut up, don't make anybody uncomfortable.
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:54.760]  We've got to make more people uncomfortable.
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:58.240]  Those kids are learning that they're not American.
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:01.360]  They need to pull their kids out of that school if they're being taught that they're
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:02.840]  not an American.
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:08.400]  They need to say, yes, I am an American and I'm going to wear an American flag on my shirt.
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:12.080]  And if they get in trouble for it, pull the kid out of the school.
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:13.080]  Well, it's the same issue.
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:14.960]  You can't wear an American flag.
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:16.120]  You can't burn a Quran.
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:19.040]  You can't have a mosque.
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:22.800]  If we all poke each other's eyes out, we're going to be blind here.
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:24.720]  Anything else, Ellie?
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:28.880]  I think that what's going on in the schools really needs to be looked at.
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:33.640]  What they are teaching our children that are growing up is that they're not American.
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:35.520]  They can't think for themselves.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:36.800]  Home is not important.
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:38.880]  The family is not important.
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:39.880]  Religion is not important.
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:40.880]  God is not important.
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:41.880]  The state is important.
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:42.880]  And it's got to stop.
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:45.880]  And parents need to really look at the school districts.
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:50.320]  Well, these are supposedly independent school districts, but they've been fully federalized.
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:51.720]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:53.880]  Wilson in Florida, welcome.
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:56.760]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:58.840]  It's always a pleasure to speak to you.
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:13:59.840]  Good to talk to you.
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:00.840]  I'm glad.
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:01.840]  Yep.
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:05.520]  I'm glad how things are coming along ever since I started listening like two years ago.
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:10.920]  Since Obama ran and then I just woke up to things and I started learning of the information
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:13.680]  you put in out there and everything's coming along good.
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:15.960]  You know, at first it started out kind of rough.
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:20.240]  People didn't really understand, but now I have even some of my closest friends and family
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:24.040]  always listening when I call in and so they're going to be listening to this.
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:28.040]  And I just have two questions for you.
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:33.480]  This one, what are you planning on doing on the 10-year anniversary of September 11th?
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:39.120]  That's, I think, an extremely monumental time and point right there.
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:44.960]  Well, number one, I'm always asked to go to ground zero.
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:51.040]  I've been there for three anniversaries, or is it four, but I like to let we are changed.
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:57.600]  The other groups and architects and engineers be leaders for themselves.
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:05.600]  But on the 10th anniversary, I'll most assuredly go to New York because it is so important.
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:07.800]  And so that's basically my answer on that point.
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:08.800]  Okay.
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:09.800]  Yes.
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:10.800]  Yes.
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:16.120]  Because I think 10 years, that's going to be like the most important time since it happened.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:20.880]  And last question, who do you think will be the ideal candidate to run with Ron Paul
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:25.200]  like as far as his top three, like the vice president and then the secretary of state
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:29.160]  and then maybe the person who was in charge of the treasury.
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:30.160]  And that's it.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:32.360]  Boy, that is a really important question.
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:34.880]  I've thought about that.
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:40.920]  And I would hope that he would get a true constitutionalist in there.
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:45.000]  Chuck Baldwin is very well known, is a great patriot, but I don't know if he's well enough
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:52.600]  known to be a strong or as strong a candidate as Ron Paul would need.
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:53.600]  But that's a question.
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:59.400]  If you could run a poll or have people email in, in fact, folks, why don't you Twitter?
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:02.720]  It's twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:05.640]  Your ideas will print a few of those off.
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:09.800]  And Matt Ryan will remind me in the last five minutes of this hour to read some of those
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:11.560]  recommendations on air.
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:16.960]  So Twitter to the real Alex Jones, twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones, your ideas.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:21.480]  In fact, do that right now, Wilson, if you're able to get on the computer and others and
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:27.040]  will read 10 or, or so of your ideas, I appreciate the call, Wilson, good to have you and your
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.560]  family on board.
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.320]  Let's talk to Tyler in California.
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:31.320]  You're on the air.
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:32.320]  Oh, hey, Alex.
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:33.320]  Nice to talk to you again.
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:34.320]  Good to talk to you.
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:39.400]  Yeah, I don't know if you noticed, but our conversation last week sparked quite the debate
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:45.360]  on YouTube remarket and much like myself, the vast majority realized that you avoided
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:48.560]  my key points on the issue and started talking about something else.
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:49.560]  So I'd like to.
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:53.040]  Well, I don't remember the phone call and I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:56.720]  But yeah, let me think.
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:16:59.720]  You're the guy that called in and said you're a fan of zeitgeist.
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:00.720]  Yeah.
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:01.720]  Yeah.
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:02.720]  Okay.
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:07.280]  And so instead of addressing the central points, I don't know what your central point
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:08.280]  is.
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:13.600]  Tell me now that the free market is the main, main cause behind all of our problems because
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:19.520]  it naturally progresses to global monopoly and through cyclical consumption of the resource
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:20.520]  sources.
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:21.520]  That is the true source.
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:22.520]  No, people.
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:23.520]  People.
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:27.760]  No, I remember the call now you've refreshed my memory and I did respond to everything
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:28.760]  you said.
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:29.760]  Okay.
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:31.040]  We don't have a true free market.
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:38.160]  We have a oligopoly, a group of cartels using globalism and collectivism to destroy
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:39.760]  any chance at free market.
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:45.280]  A free market is I have a right to buy property and then I have a right to sell it later or
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:50.760]  I have a right to paint an oil painting and then sell it without government being involved.
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:54.160]  And so I support freedom and the Bill of Rights of Constitution.
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:18:01.200]  I do not support a computer that is quote fair, well, who programs the computer and
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:07.600]  reallocates resources and that is what is being proposed by the groups you're promoting.
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:10.640]  That is a nightmare situation.
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:12.600]  So I appreciate your call.
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:14.200]  Let's go ahead and I'm going quicker to the calls.
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:15.800]  Let's go to John in Texas.
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:17.200]  John, you're on the air.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:18.200]  Hi, Alex.
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:19.200]  Hey, buddy.
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:25.640]  A while ago, you talked about that guy at the Austin gun show that was arrested and
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:28.880]  at the end of his trial, he found ghillie and at the end of your article, he said he
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:36.480]  said he was sent to six months in a work camp, aka labor camp as wondering, you know, we
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:40.000]  all know who used the labor camp system that was the Soviet system and most of the people
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.640]  went into the labor camp for all innocent, which this guy is.
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:45.120]  So I was wondering if you ever looked more into that.
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:47.600]  Well, I mean, we covered the Austin gun show.
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:50.120]  We went over the topics, the issues.
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:56.520]  They have the military commissions operation, the civilian inmate labor camp program.
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:01.760]  The army even run some of these and they make you work and people say good, make them work.
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:06.040]  But if you watch the movie, the Shawshank Redemption, it's a fiction story, but it's based on real
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:07.520]  things that have happened.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:11.440]  You notice that the warden is making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and this is
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:18.360]  set back in the fifties off of his labor and his, his, his, his crews are building roads
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:23.040]  and the local road builder comes to him and says, Hey, you're putting me out of business.
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:26.680]  You know, my people can't compete with slave wages or, or no pay.
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:29.600]  And the warden says, well, pay me off then.
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:33.760]  And so he comes back a week later with a pie with a thousand dollars on top of it.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:39.400]  And so the average prison pay is 15 to 25 cents an hour, depending on the state, the highest
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:40.840]  is about 25 cents.
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:45.360]  And then of course we can't compete against the illegal aliens or the tens of millions
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:49.560]  of people in and out of the prison system every few years on average, about five million
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:51.320]  are in prison any one time.
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:53.280]  So of course we can't compete with this.
[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:57.320]  So it's a deindustrialization program and it's legalizing modern slavery.
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:58.320]  We'll be back.
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:19:59.320]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:07.400]  Remain in your houses, the president of the United States has declared martial law under
[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:11.760]  executive order 11,004 will they do it?
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:14.320]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:19.960]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:20.960]  day.
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:23.400]  Think it can't happen here.
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:27.560]  Executive order 10, 990 locks down all highways.
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:32.440]  Executive order 10, 995 ceases control of all media outlets.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:37.000]  Executive order 10, 998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:42.800]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:46.960]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions
[02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:51.360]  about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.680]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.

[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:09.320]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:13.040]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:14.040]  documents.
[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:18.480]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:20.960]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:23.720]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:27.040]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:32.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.440]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:38.920]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:39.920]  financial system.
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:42.800]  Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:46.520]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:49.360]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:28.480]  We're back live my friends, thank you for joining us coming up, Ron Paul starts to seriously
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:33.320]  hint that he's going to run for president and he quotes the same reasons that I've stated
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:37.800]  that you can bet if he's in good health he is going to run, he is 74 years old but he's
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:40.840]  in great shape, exercises every day.
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:44.520]  That is coming up amongst all the other important news that we're going to be covering, let's
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:49.360]  continue to quickly go to your phone calls, Mike in California you're on the air.
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:51.920]  God bless you, Mr. Jones.
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:54.200]  I'm doing alright, what's on your mind?
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:59.840]  I'll be concise there are two ideas, A1 on the voting process because it's a secret ballot
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:04.360]  so it's pretty easy to manipulate, all of a sudden G, Barack Obama won and so have all
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:05.360]  the incumbents.
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:10.200]  I would personally not have a problem with taking a photograph with my phone and having
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:15.520]  everybody sign in data and send it into a central counting location like even you guys,
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:21.400]  so all of a sudden Ron Paul doesn't win but you guys got 500,000 votes for him or whatever,
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:26.560]  and you can substantiate, hey, this has been duly counted, there's a fraud to happen.
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:31.800]  The other recommendation I got is to simply circle down with federal crap going on with
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:37.000]  Arizona and the rest of us, because I'm in California, I'm only 90 miles from San Diego,
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.040]  we got pretty good sort of problems up here too.
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:44.080]  If every state from Florida to California were to just say, you know what, screw it,
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:48.200]  we're going to succeed, then all of a sudden the federal jurisdiction would not apply,
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:52.960]  we would have the right and the legitimacy to enforce our own borders without any federal
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:55.240]  circumvention when I wouldn't be surprised that a while ago.
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:59.960]  The problem with California is a lot of the people there want it to be Mexico, so it probably
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:02.960]  will succeed down the road and become part of Mexico.
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:07.600]  That's part of the LaRica Conquista, la invasora, but interesting points Mike, I appreciate
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:08.600]  your call.
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:10.480]  Eric in Wisconsin, you're on the year.
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:12.000]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  Good.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.160]  Hey, I am proud to announce that I was part of the movement yesterday.
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:22.000]  Well Kevin Barrett, Tom Spellman from Architects and Engineers for 9-11, Matthew Haas and
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:27.520]  Lou Stelzenberg, we all went to our representative Tammy Baldwin's office and handed them and
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:31.520]  their representatives the information from Architects and Engineers for 9-11 truth.
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:34.480]  So I'm just proud to announce that I'm part of the movement.
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:40.200]  And if there's anybody listening that's from the Wisconsin area that is in Tammy Baldwin's
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:45.320]  district, feel free to give her a call for number 608-258-9800.
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:50.640]  Sir, sir, I appreciate your call, but I have a rule, we can't, and I think you're a good
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:55.000]  caller and a nice guy and I commend what you're doing.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:59.040]  But we, if people want to give numbers out, you've got to say who it is, we've got to
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:01.280]  look it up and give it out ourselves.
[02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:06.760]  Because if I start letting everybody, the trolls will call in and give out fake numbers
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:09.800]  to some little old lady to try to cause us problems.
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:13.480]  That's a talk radio rule, but did you have anything else you wanted to add Eric?
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:15.120]  Okay, he's gone.
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:17.680]  I do know in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:18.680]  Go ahead.
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:20.180]  Hello, Alex.
[02:27:20.180 --> 02:27:27.800]  I felt obliged to make a comment about people wearing the United States flag on their clothes.
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:32.720]  When I was in the 60s, when I was in grade school, we learned in Girl Scouts that when
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:38.760]  you treat the flag reverently as you do religious symbols also, you don't wear the flag as an
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:40.760]  article of clothing.
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:46.240]  It's changed in the 70s with some of the radicals, but for many people, especially older people
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:51.520]  and foreigners who see Americans wearing their flag, it looks more like the Americans don't
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:54.920]  care about America when they desecrate the flag.
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:58.960]  But you understand it's their free speech right to wear the American flag.
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:27:59.960]  I do understand.
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:02.480]  Because we don't worship the flag.
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:05.680]  We are reverent on the flag because it represents the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:06.960]  See, they don't get mad.
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:11.280]  It's not people freaking out about the Bill of Rights and Constitution being flushed down
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:12.920]  the commode.
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:16.640]  It then becomes just an obsession about the flag itself.
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:22.280]  When people do actions that can be symbolic, and the flag is very symbolic, it seems to
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:26.720]  me that they should be more careful about what actions they choose to take because when
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:32.320]  the actions are interpreted wrongly by foreigners or by older people like me, it is offensive
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:33.320]  to us.
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:36.000]  It still offends me to see people wearing the flag on their clothes.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  I don't say anything.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  Oh, what about the military?
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.920]  They've got an American flag on their shoulder.
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:42.200]  But that's not the same thing.
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:45.960]  When you wear it as a badge that you are working for the United States, it's one thing.
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:52.400]  When you wear it on a cedar pants or on a t-shirt, and it's in an inappropriate...
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:57.680]  What about red, white, and blue napkins for that you lie?
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:03.320]  The point is, Alex, that it's a symbol and a person has to be aware of the symbolic actions
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:04.320]  when he does that.
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:05.320]  Sure.
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:07.840]  Is it right, though, to burn the flag?
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:10.800]  If it's legal, I agree with it, yes.
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:16.280]  But they shouldn't make a law making it illegal just because a democracy wants it, two wolves
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:19.080]  and a sheep voting on dinner on what's for dinner.
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:23.480]  I mean, I don't like burning the American flag, but it's their right to do it or I lose
[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:24.480]  my right.
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:25.480]  I have to agree.
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:28.720]  But you have to understand that people have to be careful of their behavior, even if it's
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:29.720]  not illegal.
[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:30.720]  No, no.
[02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:31.800]  I mean, we should all govern ourselves.
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:32.800]  That's correct.
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:33.800]  Absolutely.
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:34.800]  That's a good point.
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:39.320]  And I guess my whole issue is that, you know, the Muslims, some of them would say the same
[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:42.680]  thing about the Koran or about anything else.
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:48.360]  And so we either have freedom of speech and freedom of private property and assembly or
[02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:49.360]  we don't have it.
[02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:50.360]  We'll be back.
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:51.360]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:52.520]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:55.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:06.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network, tyranny is here.
[02:30:06.040 --> 02:30:09.680]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:12.360]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:16.880]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:18.120]  on earth.
[02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:22.920]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:24.760]  expanded nationwide.
[02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:29.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[02:30:29.440 --> 02:30:30.800]  shadow state.
[02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:34.960]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:39.320]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:45.120]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:48.640]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:50.680]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:50.680 --> 02:30:51.680]  It's here.

[02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:10.320]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:14.160]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:16.840]  anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:21.600]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:30.840]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:34.360]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:42.240]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.

[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:20.840]  GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:21.840]  We are back live.
[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:25.520]  I'm going to go straight into the news and then more of your phone calls.

[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:37.440]  Trying to get people to focus in on issues that really matter and understand who the
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:43.640]  global elite are and what their game plan is because it's bad for 99.9% of the world
[02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:45.320]  population.
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:50.120]  Before we get into all this news, including the latest developments with the Koran burning

[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:14.720]  You cannot count on the government during a collapse or a problem or an emergency to
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:15.720]  take care of you.

[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:08.920]  They're fond of saying that they're in the business of selling steel-plated peace of
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:09.920]  mind.
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:12.400]  Safe rooms, you name it, fortification doors.
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:16.560]  They sell everything you need to be more ready for what's happening and what's coming
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:17.560]  down the pike.

[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:32.240]  Let me get into the news here.
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:34.280]  And boy, is there a lot of it.
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:40.520]  I'm going to move as quickly as possible so we can get more of your phone calls and this
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:41.520]  story is so huge.
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:43.360]  We should have talked about this for the whole show.
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:47.000]  Hamilton and Keen call for domestic terrorism agency.
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.400]  What do you think Homeland Security is?
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:52.200]  What do you think mobile naked body scanners are for?
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:58.160]  What do you think the Mayak and Homeland Security reports cover?
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:01.000]  They cover you, the American people.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.680]  It's all aimed at you.
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:05.080]  The guns are swung around domestically.
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:09.400]  The people that run our country and run our Pentagon have taken over more than 100 countries.
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:10.840]  They put dictators in.
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:11.840]  They want tyranny.
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:15.480]  They got a lot of well-meaning people that serve them who are compartmentalized.
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:21.120]  And now they admit four domestic groups use the infregard, the clergy response team,
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:26.760]  the 800 plus thousand top secret USA private spies, the private mercenaries.
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:32.560]  It's all for us and this story is so important and it, of course, integrates in dovetails
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:38.680]  with the Pentagon saying we've got to, quote, secure the web by tracking and tracing it.
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:40.920]  That's also up on the websites.
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:43.840]  Hamilton and Keen called for domestic terrorism agency.
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:49.520]  The federal government needs an agency specifying and specifically charged with identifying radicalization
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:52.960]  or working to prevent terrorist recruitment of U.S. citizens and residents.
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:57.760]  What do they say, the internet, anti-globalist, anti-New World Order.
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:00.140]  What does Homeland Security say in their reports?
[02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:01.140]  What does FEMA say?
[02:38:01.140 --> 02:38:03.440]  What does the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center say?
[02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.000]  They want to shut down free speech.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.440]  They want these hate laws.
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:08.680]  They want it all.
[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:10.040]  It's incredible.
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:13.720]  So that's up on the site.
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:18.640]  Continuing here with the news.
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:24.960]  Here is the latest developments dealing with the Koran burning set for tomorrow at International
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:29.880]  Burn Koran Day, the epicenter being in Florida.
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:33.120]  Koran burning pastor says he has a two-hour deadline.
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:37.960]  The pastor at the center of the Koran burning fight has given a New York EMOM two hours
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:41.920]  to contact him about plans to build a mosque near ground zero.
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:48.560]  He was previously visited by one of the top EMOMs involved and told that, and I believe
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:52.280]  he's telling the truth about this, told that they would move the mosque if he didn't do
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:53.280]  this.
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:55.600]  Then the EMOM came out and said, I didn't tell him that specifically.
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:39:00.760]  I said I'd talk to him about maybe doing it if he didn't burn the Koran.
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:03.120]  And so now he's put out a two-hour deadline.
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:08.560]  We'll be writing about this and covering it on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:14.000]  But Muslims need to know this, if that Koran gets burned and you run around and blow stuff
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:18.080]  up or burn buildings or the government may do it and blame it on you, and are you do
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:23.200]  that overseas, it's going to be used to further demonize you, and it'll be used as a pretext
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:24.760]  to limit your numbers being immigrated.
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:27.880]  It will probably actually accelerate it, but on paper they'll claim they're going to limit
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:28.880]  it.
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:30.920]  They're going to use it to try to limit free speech in this country.
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:35.200]  So if you really are an American and you really are for free speech, stop having your
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:37.440]  chain pulled, your buttons pushed.
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:38.440]  Don't buy into this.
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:39.640]  Don't go along with it.
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:42.000]  I said the same thing on the mosque at ground zero.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.360]  You can't have your cake and eat it too, living in a free country.
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:48.360]  You go to Saudi Arabia, criticize the government, they'll chop your head off.
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:49.360]  Okay?
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:52.200]  I mean, if you like that, you like living like that, go there.
[02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:53.200]  Okay?
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:55.200]  It's that simple.
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:59.840]  The pastor at the center of the Koran burning has given the New York Imam two hours.
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:07.160]  Pastor Terry Jones and his colleague, Pastor K. A. Paul, read out two telephone numbers
[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:11.360]  live on television and urged the Imam to contact him as soon as possible.
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:12.360]  Well, that's crazy.
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:15.280]  They're going to, he'd never be able to get through if he tried.
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:19.600]  They did not say what would happen if he failed to get in touch with them and the deadline
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:22.320]  expires just after 8.30 tonight.
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:26.120]  Well, how can that be a two hour?
[02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:32.320]  I guess Sky News got their time zones wrong because that's five hours, six hours from
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:33.320]  now.
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:35.400]  That is not two and a half hours.
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:39.720]  Sky News US correspondent, Robert Nisbet, who was at the news conference said this is
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:40.720]  absolutely extraordinary.
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:44.920]  It appears the pastor has reconsidered his earlier deal over the New York mosque.
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:46.280]  That deal was broken.
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:48.480]  The Imam says he didn't make the deal with him.
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:52.240]  So they're saying the pastor has backed off and waffled or flip-flop.
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:53.240]  No, he hasn't.
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:57.920]  He says he had a deal and the deal has been broken.
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:03.200]  Regardless of what you think of this guy and his church, that's what's going on here.
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:08.600]  He added, worryingly, none of the US cable network showed the press conference, so Imam
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:10.680]  Raouf may not have seen it.
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:11.800]  You got to love the media.
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:13.920]  They hype all this for three weeks.
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:18.000]  We sit back and watch it, hardly talk about it, hoping this wouldn't turn into this.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:22.720]  And then now, a day before, they announced last night, oh, we're going to stop covering
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:24.400]  it, but they're really still covering it.
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:29.160]  They're just not covering what the pastor actually has to say.
[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:37.680]  Okay, the audio of this is up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.net in Steve Watson's article.
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:42.880]  Congressman Ron Paul hints at 2012 presidential campaign.
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:45.320]  And something I think about every single day.
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:48.720]  The Texas Congress from Ron Paul has hinted that he is strongly considering another presidential
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:49.720]  run in 2012.
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:53.240]  If he's going to do it, he needs to get going.
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:54.720]  He needs to get a jump on him.
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:58.800]  Paul, who previously ran for the Republican nomination in 08 and under the libertarian
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:03.420]  party in 88, told an interviewer that it's something I think about every single day.
[02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:07.160]  The congressman's comments came during an interview with his former House colleague
[02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:13.280]  Bob Bowman, a legal counsel for the sovereign society, an independent investment advisory
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:14.280]  group.
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:18.320]  Paul said it would be a tough decision, but that he believes the American people are
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:21.760]  ready to embrace a new political direction.
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:25.960]  The comments have not been picked up by the mainstream media sources as of yet.
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:29.360]  The congressman has previously downplayed rumors, but other presidential campaigns
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:33.360]  saying it is unlikely, however, following a string of successes in recent surveys and
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:37.320]  straw polls, including victory in the conservative political action committee, CPAC presidential
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:38.320]  straw poll.
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:42.080]  It seemed Paul is now considering reconsidering his earlier statements.
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:48.200]  Well, look, Paul knows that the platform, even if he loses to talk about true liberty,
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:55.120]  true conservatism, anti-war, exposing the private Federal Reserve, he must run so that
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:59.200]  he's in those debates and reaches tens of millions more Americans.
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:03.320]  You think the movement for liberty got energized in the true original Tea Party had its head
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:07.520]  had its genesis because of Ron Paul's 2007-2008 run.
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:09.520]  This will super turbocharge it.
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:12.400]  We'll be deeper into the depression in the next year and a half.
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:16.840]  Everything he talked about and we talked about is coming true ran Paul's now 15 points
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:20.880]  ahead, gaining seven to eight points against his rival because the demonization campaign
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:21.880]  backfired.
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:32.320]  He has got to run.
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:37.200]  Paul's comments add weight to more recent rumblings that he may once again pick up the
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:40.560]  presidential campaign mantle in 2012.
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:44.760]  Earlier this year, the congressman's wife, Carol, stated that if you ask him, now he'd
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:45.760]  probably say no.
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:49.400]  He didn't do that on the show, but he did say things are happening so quickly and fast
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:50.400]  in the country.
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:55.200]  If we're at a crisis period and they need someone with a knowledge he has, then he would
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:58.640]  do it and it goes on from there.
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:04.960]  Now we put the question out to twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones, Twitter folks,
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:08.960]  and we said, who would you like to see him run with?
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:10.320]  And we got hundreds of these.
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:16.560]  I can't read them all, but the first one is, hmm, Ron Paul forward slash Jesse Ventura.
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:20.760]  Well, I happened to be with Ventura for three days.
[02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:21.760]  We flew together.
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:22.760]  We stayed at the same hotel.
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:24.160]  We ate dinner together.
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:26.440]  We walked around the French Quarter together.
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:30.800]  We spent a lot of time.
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:38.000]  And you know, Jesse basically said that he's not going to beat his head up against a wall
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:42.680]  and that he doesn't think the awakening is happening fast enough and that he just wants
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:48.320]  to spend time with his wife and that he's done his work.
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:50.400]  And but you know what?
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:51.400]  He could reconsider.
[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:56.360]  Well, he said a lot more, but he didn't say it was off record, but I'm going to keep it
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:44:57.800]  myself for now.
[02:44:57.800 --> 02:45:03.840]  Continuing, Judge Andrew Napolitano should run with Ron Paul, said another Twitter to
[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:06.440]  our site.
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:09.640]  Another one said running mates Ralph Nader, Chuck Baldwin, Michelle Bachman.
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:13.320]  Yeah, Ralph Nader is kind of a socialist, not good.
[02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:17.560]  He's good on exposing corporations, but on his solutions, Michelle Bachman's okay, but
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:19.480]  nothing compared to Chuck Baldwin.
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:25.640]  Gary Johnson, I guess that's the former New Mexico governor.
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:27.080]  Jeff Sessions should run.
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:28.240]  I love him.
[02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:31.760]  Alan Key should run with Ron Paul to stop the race issue.
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:33.760]  That's an interesting idea.
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:34.760]  Charlie Sheen.
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:35.760]  Yeah.
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:40.160]  Uh, says Ron Paul for president with Jesse Ventura's vice.
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:42.120]  I think that comes up most often.
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:45.360]  Who should Ron Paul in 2012 Ron Paul, of course.
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:51.960]  Yeah, we know that Twitter, but we want to know who he should run with.
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:53.320]  What about of a Rand Paul Ron Paul?
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:54.320]  That'd be crazy.
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:58.520]  Uh, Andrew Dupolitano, Ron Paul's running mate should be Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:03.640]  And then they misspell Emmerich because half the information on the Wikipedia page is wrong
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:05.160]  about me and they won't let us fix it.
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:06.640]  You got to love Wikipedia.
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:17.320]  I can't give them real information about who I am continuing Jesse Ventura again.
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:22.680]  Another one says if he really wants a power ticket on the congalinize the masses, it's
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:28.520]  got to be Paul Kosenich again, Kosenich is a complete socialist and wants to ban guns.
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:32.640]  He's a good guy and then he stands for what he believes in and he's anti-federal reserve
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:33.640]  and anti-war.
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:37.880]  But I mean, I couldn't vote for Kosenich and Ron Paul is not going to run with Kosenich.
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:39.200]  You'd better believe that.
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:41.440]  I think that Jesse Ventura will be a great vice president.
[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:45.800]  Chuck Baldwin came up, Alan Key's or Bob Barr, Alan Key's a lot better than Bob Barr.
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:52.320]  Alan Key's again, Alex Jones, the secretary of state, Judge Andrew Dupolitano should
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:59.720]  run with Ron Paul in 2012, VP Andrew Dupolitano, secretary of treasury Peter Schiff, Dr. Alan
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:04.160]  Key's would be the best running mate for Ron Paul, Chuck Baldwin for VP, Jim DeMint has
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:07.640]  the true conservative credentials to be Dr. Paul's VP.
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:11.640]  He's pretty good on a lot of issues and that is a power candidate.
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:14.800]  Rand Paul of course, who would fell in love with father and son tag team.
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:16.520]  I don't even know if that's constitutional.
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:17.680]  That's a little, that's kind of like royalty.
[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:18.680]  I don't know of them.
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:19.680]  I don't think Ron Paul would do that.
[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:21.180]  I don't think I'm for it.
[02:47:21.180 --> 02:47:23.880]  Maybe the mind, Ventura and Ron Paul will get the attention needed to win.
[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:26.040]  Nader would work too and too old.
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:27.640]  I've been around him.
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:30.240]  He kind of a little bit shaky just three years ago.
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:35.400]  I was around him and he was kind of like, no, he's, you know, he's old.
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:43.680]  Jesse Ventura for defense secretary.
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:45.880]  A lot of the same names over and over again.
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:46.880]  So there you have it.
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:49.040]  That's what listeners are thinking on that front.
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:53.360]  I'm going to come back and hit some more news, but right now, uh, let's talk to who's
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:54.360]  up first here.
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:56.560]  Let's talk to Tim in Germany, Tim in Deutschland.
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:47:58.560]  You're on the air.
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:01.040]  Yeah, you're on a bed.
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:03.040]  Yeah, I got to let you go.
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:04.040]  Sorry.
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:05.040]  Your skype's not working.
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:06.040]  Yeah.
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:07.040]  Tom in Florida.
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:08.040]  You're on the air.
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:12.960]  Taking my call and what you're doing for the American people have a horrendous story
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:16.720]  to tell you what they did to me and my family.
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:17.720]  Go ahead.
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:23.200]  Alex, I lived in a panhandle of Florida at 11 o'clock at night when I'm working on the
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:24.200]  computer.
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:31.320]  I stepped out to take a leak and through coming to at me was three jets at about 800 feet.
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:35.760]  All three of them pouring something out of their wings, which I assume was correct.
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:37.520]  You sound like a real hillbilly.
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:40.560]  Like, there's nothing like peeing in the backyard, huh?
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:43.000]  Man, my wife came out on the songwriter too.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  We were singing.
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:48.000]  American as they come from my grandfather, Clarence on down.
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.640]  I have seven children, including three I took in that belong to a friend of mine.
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:56.440]  So you were out there lovingly watering the plants and here come the jets with corn eggs
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:57.720]  that they admit they're spraying.
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:48:58.720]  Go ahead.
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:00.440]  Oh, it was a full moonlight.
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:05.200]  I wouldn't have even known it though jets didn't make any noise, barely a whisper.
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:09.840]  I stood and I watched them fly right over our house spraying the stuff out and as they
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:15.880]  crossed the island and got out to the Gulf, three more crossed from the other direction
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:16.880]  east to west.
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:22.920]  I stood and watched as the fumes came down and hit me in the face, my knees buckled.
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:24.400]  I hit the ground.
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:29.400]  I was in convulsions for 30 minutes before I could crawl back into the office.
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:34.680]  You got to listen, listen, Tom, you got to shoot a YouTube video about this in Florida.
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:38.560]  The news is reported that they have been finding a lot of Corex at the swimming pools, lakes
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:39.560]  and rivers.
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:42.440]  I know they're still spraying at that and other dispersants.
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:46.800]  This is really important because it's the perfect cover.
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:50.520]  The government's done tens of thousands of admitted chemical, biological, radiological
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:52.920]  releases over every major city in town.
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:57.760]  They do it to see if they can get the pilots to follow along, to see if they can keep it
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:02.200]  secret and they've killed people in these tests.
[02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:03.640]  So I believe this happened to you.
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:04.640]  This is huge.
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:05.880]  Absolutely, sir.
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:07.720]  I would love to tell you the story.
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:08.720]  We moved.
[02:50:08.720 --> 02:50:13.080]  Someone made the decision that me and my beautiful family was expendable.
[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:14.080]  We're not expendable.
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:15.080]  We're Americans.
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:17.400]  We've been an asset to everywhere we've been.
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:20.000]  So you had to move.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.320]  Who do you tell when the government decides you're expendable?
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:24.320]  Who do I tell?
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:25.520]  You're the only one.
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:30.760]  I peed blood for a week and I had lost about a third of my vision.
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:33.000]  We hauled ass to the mountains.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:34.640]  We're in a good position in the mountains.
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:38.080]  Well, I tell you, listen, listen, listen, I got to go, but you should write an article
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:39.080]  about it.
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:43.320]  You should send it to us with specifics, where you lived, what happened, then we can talk
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:47.440]  about it on the show, get other people from that area to find out if they had health problems.
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:51.680]  But I mean, the EPA has told people that Corex is not bad for you and there's no health
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:52.680]  problems.
[02:50:52.680 --> 02:50:53.680]  We know that's a lie.
[02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:55.600]  We'll be right back on the other side of this break.
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:58.400]  They claim they've gotten rid of 70% of the oil and I'll admit that's a lie.
[02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:03.120]  I mean, they tell you DU is good for you.
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:04.800]  What is a wind generator?
[02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:07.200]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?

[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:13.200]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:17.720]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states

[02:52:46.040 --> 02:52:49.520]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:24.840]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment

[02:54:54.000 --> 02:55:00.160]  Fed court slaps down torture lawsuit against CIA, infowars.com, links to the New York Times.
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:10.200]  Meanwhile, here is NBC News with the headline, Random Pat Downs Turned Pat Co Into Police
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:11.200]  State.
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:14.080]  That's on Alex Jones saying police state.
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:16.200]  That's NBC News.
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:18.600]  They want you to know.
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:22.480]  Those who ride Pat Co. trains between Southern New Jersey and Philadelphia should expect
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:27.240]  random searches of their clothing, pocket bags and vehicles on their morning trip to
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:28.240]  work.
[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:34.040]  Television, transports, security administration screeners armed with explosive sniffing, canine,
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:42.440]  checked 663 commuter bags randomly selected from the morning rush at the Lydden World
[02:55:42.440 --> 02:55:43.640]  Lyddenwood station.
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:46.200]  And it says they're going to continue.
[02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:51.240]  When I was in the Atlanta airport, when I'd gotten off the plane, they were announcing
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:55.960]  it's an orange alert, taros may hit, something out of the running man.
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:56:04.880]  And then I was walking and out of the, out of one of the gates comes a guy in kind of
[02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:08.240]  a Border Patrol green outfit with the German Shepherd.
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:11.240]  And I look over and here's the German Shepherd right up next to me.
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:16.640]  And he was just had his, and the cop had his arms out kind of in the chicken mode.
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:18.140]  Like we're on tough.
[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:23.800]  He was like, looking at me, I was just, I mean, let me tell you something, naked body
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:26.840]  scanners, all of this going on the streets of America.
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:29.640]  This is all about training you to line up and answer questions.
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:31.880]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:34.640]  The globalist stage those attacks bottom line.
[02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:37.480]  They stage the Gulf of Tonkin, the rest of it and it's sick.
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:41.400]  And they've got the police in here being quoted as saying, we can quote, do whatever
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:43.280]  we want to you.
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:48.200]  And all these congressmen, Stark and others on video saying, you have no rights, the federal
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:50.600]  government can do whatever it wants.
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:54.300]  And the federal government's run by a bunch of crooked offshore banks.
[02:56:54.300 --> 02:57:00.280]  It was chaotic, said Kevin Grexen, an accountant for Motorola, who commutes to Philadelphia
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:03.800]  daily, told the courier post, nobody was sure what was happening, whether it was safe to
[02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:07.240]  get on the train or that we were carrying something we shouldn't.
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:11.560]  Delaware River Port Authority police chief, David McClintock, told the courier post of
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:15.480]  Cherry Hill screeners were looking for improvised explosive devices and weapons.
[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:17.720]  See, that's their cover.
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:21.080]  But out of the 600 plus people search, they found one crack pipe.
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:22.960]  Oh, aren't they keeping us safe?
[02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:26.840]  Meanwhile, they admit the government grows the opium in Afghanistan.
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:34.240]  The chief says out of the 666 bags searched, that's a quote, between 6am and 10am, a crack
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:37.320]  pipe was the only item confiscated.
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:40.560]  We can conduct any kind of search we want, said McClintock.
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:45.080]  We could ask the TSA to bring wands or x-ray machines like they have in airports, though
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:49.300]  we don't think that's appropriate for pat co-writers at this time.
[02:57:49.300 --> 02:57:54.720]  There are 5,000 commuters passing through the station daily, according to courier post.
[02:57:54.720 --> 02:58:00.000]  The searchers will be conducted by a freshly hired DRPA police several times a month without
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.160]  advance warning at various stations.
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:05.680]  They go on to admit they're going to have this in malls.
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:12.520]  Just search the term, FBI wants scanners in malls, 500 mobile vans, many times more powerful
[02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.640]  than a chest x-ray, blasting your house.
[02:58:16.640 --> 02:58:21.720]  Pretty soon they'll tell you your kids have got a snort DU or maybe drink lead and they'll
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:24.920]  just say it's to fight al-Qaeda.
[02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:28.080]  So our journey into total enslavement is accelerating.
[02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:32.360]  I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. in the first hour I have Patrice O'Neill on.
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:36.480]  It's pretty powerful info, want to say great job to the crew, keep spreading the word about
[02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:37.480]  the broadcast, folks.
[02:58:37.480 --> 02:59:00.560]  That's why we're reaching so many people.
