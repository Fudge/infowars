[00:00.000 --> 00:13.220]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.220 --> 00:22.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.000 --> 00:34.800]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Thursday December 11th 2014 another week
[00:34.800 --> 00:40.480]  of betrayal by the GOP to their voters to their conservative voters even to the
[00:40.480 --> 00:45.800]  conservative congressman who've not been given a chance to see what's in a massive
[00:45.800 --> 00:50.720]  spending bill for the second time in two weeks we're also going to talk about the
[00:50.720 --> 00:56.360]  massive betrayal of the American public specifically a lot of Democrat voters who
[00:56.360 --> 01:00.880]  voted for Obama because they thought he was going to clean up the torture that
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.920]  was going on in the CIA instead what they did was they rewarded the people who
[01:05.920 --> 01:10.200]  had been in charge of that we're going to look at the big picture of the torture
[01:10.200 --> 01:15.000]  report we're also going to talk to Joe Biggs who was in Afghanistan Iraq we're
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.560]  going to talk to him about what he saw on the ground as he mentioned he's
[01:18.560 --> 01:24.680]  delivered people to facilities that he believed they're being tortured facilities
[01:24.680 --> 01:27.920]  where he didn't see the people in some cases come out so we want to talk about
[01:27.920 --> 01:34.120]  that there's been a lot that's been said on the radio as well as on the news
[01:34.120 --> 01:40.360]  excusing everybody involved it's like nobody knew this was going on come on
[01:40.360 --> 01:44.960]  we've known about this for over a decade everybody in America has known this is
[01:44.960 --> 01:49.640]  going on George Bush knew about it this report from Senator Feinstein is a
[01:49.640 --> 01:54.520]  whitewash of the American government of the American people and what it reveals
[01:54.520 --> 01:58.560]  is that we have a secretive government that operates in the dark on a black
[01:58.560 --> 02:03.120]  budget called the CIA they can do anything they want and they can get away
[02:03.120 --> 02:08.720]  with it murder torture whatever that's what the real source of this report is
[02:08.720 --> 02:14.160]  the real findings of this report is they can do anything they want but the day is
[02:14.160 --> 02:17.120]  coming where there's going to be a day of reckoning if it doesn't happen to them
[02:17.120 --> 02:21.800]  on this earth it's going to happen eventually I don't want this stuff done
[02:21.800 --> 02:25.600]  in my name a lot of us have been saying this for a long time but it's amazing
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.080]  how some people are now backing off some people who are very critical of this are
[02:30.080 --> 02:35.200]  backing off people who would have criticized and did criticize Obama's
[02:35.200 --> 02:40.200]  attempt to immediately put John Brennan one of the people who was in charge of
[02:40.200 --> 02:45.180]  very high up in the CIA apologist for the enhanced interrogation he wanted to
[02:45.180 --> 02:49.680]  make him head of the CIA immediately but then wisely backed off and did that
[02:49.680 --> 02:55.520]  about five years later in the meantime they use John Brennan as someone laying
[02:55.520 --> 03:01.560]  down legal cover for drone assassinations then he takes his place at the
[03:01.560 --> 03:05.640]  CIA you think anything's going to happen there no but we're going to take a look
[03:05.640 --> 03:09.640]  at what the GOP is doing now of course we've seen for the second time in two
[03:09.640 --> 03:13.040]  weeks it was last week that they passed through the massive defense spending
[03:13.040 --> 03:18.080]  bill they released it 1600 pages they're released at 10 30 at night on a
[03:18.080 --> 03:21.080]  Tuesday then had to have that vote on the following Thursday they've done it
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.600]  again this week again with the omnibus spending bill and it's not just a
[03:25.600 --> 03:28.480]  continuing resolution to go for a couple of months this is going to continue
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.560]  the government all the way through until September 2015 we're going to look at
[03:33.560 --> 03:37.360]  what they crammed in this bill and didn't give anybody a chance to take a
[03:37.360 --> 03:40.480]  look at it remember when everybody criticized Pelosi for saying we're
[03:40.480 --> 03:44.620]  going to have to pass Obamacare so we can see what's in it the Republicans
[03:44.620 --> 03:49.840]  pledged at that time that they would give the public give Congress time to
[03:49.840 --> 03:53.680]  take a look at these massive bills instead of cramming them through at the
[03:53.680 --> 03:57.240]  last minute but then of course this week we see that we've got a continuing
[03:57.240 --> 04:02.200]  resolution slash omnibus bill they call it the Cromney bus because it's kind of
[04:02.200 --> 04:06.200]  a hybrid between the two it goes for yet another year we see that they bring
[04:06.200 --> 04:11.800]  this in again on 830 like this last Tuesday and then today it has to be
[04:11.800 --> 04:16.400]  voted on otherwise they're going to run out of money they're not shutting down
[04:16.400 --> 04:19.480]  anything they said they were going to shut down they're not going to shut down
[04:19.480 --> 04:22.520]  Obamacare they're not going to shut down the amnesty they're going to continue
[04:22.520 --> 04:28.160]  to fund all of that and of course as rumored as feared there is a massive
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.680]  backpedaling on the little bit of control that was put on the banks in the
[04:32.680 --> 04:39.320]  wake of tarp yeah they're going to sign us up to guarantee their derivative
[04:39.320 --> 04:44.160]  gambles on a much much larger scale than we ever saw with the mortgages that's
[04:44.160 --> 04:47.840]  a part of it using FDIC insurance we'll be right back we're going to talk about
[04:47.840 --> 04:51.680]  that and we're going to talk about the bankers turning into preppers what's
[04:51.680 --> 04:55.480]  behind that stay with us we'll be right back

[08:11.480 --> 08:16.280]  transparency issues we cover what we are allowed to cover lack of
[08:16.280 --> 08:20.120]  transparency is a huge political advantage information management has
[08:20.120 --> 08:23.960]  become so sophisticated every administration learns from the
[08:23.960 --> 08:28.840]  previous one I've got a parent and I've got a father there are actions I have the
[08:28.840 --> 08:32.120]  legal authority to take as president what do you say to someone who believes
[08:32.120 --> 08:37.160]  the president took action to change the law we did not change the law we got to
[08:37.160 --> 08:42.120]  within the law what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just
[08:42.120 --> 09:09.240]  took an action to change the law
[09:09.240 --> 09:19.920]  the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones welcome to the Alex
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.920]  Jones show I'm David Knight on this Thursday December 11 2014 of course they
[09:24.920 --> 09:28.680]  are breaking the law they're changing the law they're doing whatever they want
[09:28.680 --> 09:34.560]  and the response from the mainstream press is that's just awesome that's what
[09:34.560 --> 09:38.840]  we saw yesterday from Fox News talking about the release of this torture
[09:38.840 --> 09:42.480]  report don't worry about that we're awesome everything we do is awesome it
[09:42.480 --> 09:46.240]  doesn't matter what anybody says about us just just put that out of your mind
[09:46.240 --> 09:50.320]  we're awesome we're not like a third world dictatorship that's right we're
[09:50.320 --> 09:55.560]  not we're a dictatorship with nuclear weapons and militarized police never been
[09:55.560 --> 10:00.120]  equipped like this before in the past and never had the kind of access to our
[10:00.120 --> 10:02.480]  data we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about the torture
[10:02.480 --> 10:07.720]  report and we're going to talk about the new continuing resolution omnibus bill
[10:07.720 --> 10:13.440]  that the Republicans are sneaking through the house as we speak only gave it out
[10:13.440 --> 10:20.680]  on 8 at 8 30 p.m. on Tuesday 1600 pages a trillion dollars of spending and all
[10:20.680 --> 10:26.320]  kinds of things not related to spending changing and crafting policy prohibiting
[10:26.320 --> 10:31.640]  this allowing that all of this stuff was put through without anybody having any
[10:31.640 --> 10:36.080]  time to look at this no public oversight no understanding of what they're voting
[10:36.080 --> 10:39.240]  on sounds kind of like Pelosi doesn't it they criticize Pelosi for that for
[10:39.240 --> 10:43.000]  saying we have to pass the bill so we can see what's in it that's the way the
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.760]  Republicans have operated twice now in two weeks they did the same thing last
[10:46.760 --> 10:51.000]  week the defense spending bill bringing it out at 10 30 on a Tuesday and forcing
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.280]  it through on a Thursday for a vote now as we just saw that breaking the law
[10:55.280 --> 11:00.080]  opening there it's interesting to see Obama stumbling on his own answers here
[11:00.080 --> 11:04.920]  over a heated immigration exchange with reporter or hey Ramos this is from IJ
[11:04.920 --> 11:10.840]  review talked about this he heckled the president essentially saying if you as
[11:10.840 --> 11:14.400]  you're saying always had the legal authority to stop deportations then why
[11:14.400 --> 11:19.360]  did you deport 2 million people say that's the thing he said 22 times he
[11:19.360 --> 11:24.240]  didn't have the authority under the law to just do whatever he wanted we had we
[11:24.240 --> 11:29.400]  were a nation of law he said so he had to follow the law that was put down by
[11:29.400 --> 11:34.760]  the Congress now he says to another immigrant heckler he says I changed the
[11:34.760 --> 11:38.000]  law for you then they try to work that back we're going to talk about how the
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.400]  Republicans are playing ball with him in this new budget but first I want to go
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.360]  over some of the things we saw from the torture report we need to take a look at
[11:46.360 --> 11:51.360]  this from the perspective of what's happening here and going to happen here
[11:51.360 --> 11:56.400]  domestically in America and of course we just learned today from Justin Amash a
[11:56.400 --> 12:00.320]  new bill stuck through this is a time of year that they always like to sneak
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.640]  through their presence of course for us their totalitarian presence they signed
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.520]  Obama signed the NDAA the first time on a New Year's Eve they put Obama care
[12:09.520 --> 12:13.520]  through on Christmas Eve of course the Federal Reserve was created on a Christmas
[12:13.520 --> 12:17.920]  Eve back in 1913 so that they always like to pull these things up in the
[12:17.920 --> 12:20.880]  holidays and people aren't really paying much attention just like they'd like to
[12:20.880 --> 12:25.640]  dump the news on the weekend went bad news on the weekend so that nobody's
[12:25.640 --> 12:29.360]  paying attention but one person in Congress is paying attention Justin
[12:29.360 --> 12:34.040]  Amash noticed a bill and he talked to his colleagues about it said we need to
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.160]  have a roll call vote on it they didn't allow that they had a voice vote they
[12:38.160 --> 12:44.240]  passed this 325 to 100 it's the Intelligence Authorization Act it
[12:44.240 --> 12:48.000]  authorizes according to Justin Amash the acquisition retention and
[12:48.000 --> 12:55.040]  dissemination of all communication data from US citizens they say he points out
[12:55.040 --> 12:59.600]  in his analysis of it he said this section of the law contemplates that
[12:59.600 --> 13:05.840]  those private communications of Americans obtained without a court order may
[13:05.840 --> 13:09.680]  be transferred to domestic law enforcement for criminal investigation
[13:09.680 --> 13:14.360]  section 309 provides the first statutory authority for the acquisition
[13:14.360 --> 13:19.960]  retention and dissemination of US persons private communications he says
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.560]  obtained without legal process like a court order or a subpoena now we've
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.760]  been seeing this develop this is not something that is new that they've never
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.680]  done before but this is how they're continually incrementally taking our
[13:34.680 --> 13:38.760]  rights they start doing this and then after they've done it for a while and
[13:38.760 --> 13:43.400]  it starts to become public then they give themselves legal cover that's
[13:43.400 --> 13:47.720]  essentially what's going on with the Senate Intelligence Report they're
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.600]  trying to give themselves cover they're trying to say nobody knew we see over
[13:51.600 --> 13:55.400]  and over again in this report the CIA did this the CIA did that it was worse
[13:55.400 --> 14:00.600]  than we knew but pushed it know anything the Congress didn't know anything the
[14:00.600 --> 14:05.320]  American people didn't know anything that's the biggest lie of all to say
[14:05.320 --> 14:09.520]  that nobody knew anything we're going to talk to Joe Biggs at the bottom of the
[14:09.520 --> 14:14.560]  hour about what he saw when he was abroad with the army in Afghanistan Iraq how
[14:14.560 --> 14:18.600]  they would have people delivered what he believed was torture people would not
[14:18.600 --> 14:22.520]  come back out so we talk about this firsthand experience I want to go over
[14:22.520 --> 14:25.720]  before we get any further in the torture those some of the headlines up on
[14:25.720 --> 14:29.640]  info wars.com today of course that article I just talked about is up there
[14:29.640 --> 14:34.400]  about the new legal cover that they're giving themselves and of course they
[14:34.400 --> 14:38.720]  can't legally do that but they can do a lot of things under the cover of law
[14:38.720 --> 14:42.800]  pretending that they have the legal authority to do it and they will do it
[14:42.800 --> 14:47.760]  cops allow a Saudi baby a Saudi with a dead baby in the trunk to drive away so
[14:47.760 --> 14:51.760]  as not to offend the Muslims that's a story up by Paul Joseph Watson on info
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.840]  wars.com they say the cop pulled over a vehicle it had paper tags and a
[14:56.840 --> 15:01.000]  registration violation it had three Saudi Arabians with Saudi driver's
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.960]  licenses who told the officers they had a dead child in the trunk prepared for
[15:05.960 --> 15:11.160]  an Islamic burial at a mosque in Franklin Tennessee and the officer not
[15:11.160 --> 15:15.600]  wanting to be disrespectful to the men or their faith just let the car drive away
[15:15.600 --> 15:19.960]  without checking the story the truck to see if the story was true about that
[15:19.960 --> 15:24.720]  diplomatic community the same thing that we're seeing with people who are
[15:24.720 --> 15:28.280]  coming here illegally through the borders from any country they can come
[15:28.280 --> 15:33.880]  here and do anything they want we've seen this over and over and over again so
[15:33.880 --> 15:38.680]  that's just another example of it and as he points out in his article he says
[15:38.680 --> 15:42.400]  it'll infuriate many Americans who believe that illegal immigrants and
[15:42.400 --> 15:45.840]  other foreigners are being given free reign to commit crimes seen it in my
[15:45.840 --> 15:50.400]  own personal life I've seen it on the highway especially on traffic violations
[15:50.400 --> 15:55.560]  that's one excuse I've never used though I guess I should and I need to get some
[15:55.560 --> 15:59.400]  papers to show that I'm a Saudi I've got the beard maybe I could get away with
[15:59.400 --> 16:03.280]  that I never thought of telling them I'm from a foreign country and I have a
[16:03.280 --> 16:06.160]  dead baby in the trunk so you need to let me go maybe I'll try that next time
[16:06.160 --> 16:09.480]  they pull me over for speeding or something we also have another story
[16:09.480 --> 16:14.160]  up on info wars.com they know something why did the Treasury Department just
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.880]  purchase thousands of survival kits for bank examiners they're going in they're
[16:18.880 --> 16:23.800]  going to spend $200,000 to get about 3,800 kits and listen to the stuff
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.480]  they're putting out there the banks are turning into preppers they've got a
[16:27.480 --> 16:31.680]  fanny pack that's going to hold all this stuff they've got a 2400 calorie food
[16:31.680 --> 16:36.880]  bar a three pack of eight ounce water a 50 water purification tablets they've
[16:36.880 --> 16:42.400]  got two aspirins two ibuprofins two decongestant tablets I mean you know oh
[16:42.400 --> 16:46.480]  and this don't forget this they've got a whistle with a lanyard see that's what
[16:46.480 --> 16:51.200]  you blow when the guy with a gun takes all that stuff from you because this
[16:51.200 --> 16:54.520]  isn't really going to do the much good but it's pretty amazing that the bankers
[16:54.520 --> 16:57.320]  think that they need to send this out and of course it's all going to the big
[16:57.320 --> 17:01.360]  seven or eight banks these survival kits will be delivered to every major bank in
[17:01.360 --> 17:06.960]  the US Bank of America American Express Bank Capital One City Corps JP Morgan
[17:06.960 --> 17:12.120]  Chase Wells Fargo the usual suspects are all going to get their survival kits
[17:12.120 --> 17:19.080]  actually you know it's amazing how much the CIA is like the Federal Reserve in
[17:19.080 --> 17:26.520]  both cases they appear to be under the control of the government and yet they
[17:26.520 --> 17:29.680]  are the ones who are actually controlling the government that appearance of
[17:29.680 --> 17:35.200]  control is merely where the facade government the visual government this
[17:35.200 --> 17:40.680]  propped up phony government has a hearing and appoints the head of the
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.440]  Federal Reserve or the head of the CIA after that there's no auditing of
[17:45.440 --> 17:49.120]  anything that they do nobody's going to go to jail no matter what they do
[17:49.120 --> 17:53.400]  everything they do is in the dark it's in the secret and they're going to
[17:53.400 --> 17:58.640]  basically get away with everything that they've done over the last 10 15 years
[17:58.640 --> 18:02.760]  nobody is going to go to jail and you know the only person actually there was
[18:02.760 --> 18:07.240]  one person went to jail course and his name's not in the report he was the
[18:07.240 --> 18:12.760]  whistleblower who blew the whistle on the torture he went to jail he's still
[18:12.760 --> 18:18.200]  in jail and nobody else is going to jail we've seen that before haven't we and
[18:18.200 --> 18:22.800]  we said before I just did a report interview on Monday night talking to
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.880]  someone who has made the connection between the mortgage pump and dump and
[18:27.880 --> 18:32.000]  tracking it all the way through the money being channeled through Swiss banks
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.880]  of course we've talked in the past about whistleblowers exposing money
[18:35.880 --> 18:40.520]  laundering by the biggest banks and they get a slap on the wrist fine from the
[18:40.520 --> 18:43.920]  Justice Department the Justice Department says that they're too big to jail
[18:43.920 --> 18:49.200]  just like they're too big to fail but it goes beyond that he's got some contacts
[18:49.200 --> 18:53.640]  intelligence community that say that this is actually funding the black ops
[18:53.640 --> 18:57.800]  of course they are their funding CIA is funding their black ops with the drug
[18:57.800 --> 19:02.680]  war we've pointed that over out over and over again yet nothing happens to them
[19:02.680 --> 19:06.360]  but in many respects the two of them are exactly the same before again we're
[19:06.360 --> 19:08.800]  gonna talk more about that and we're gonna talk to Joe Biggs at the bottom
[19:08.800 --> 19:13.160]  of the hour but this is rolling out in all of the Western countries it's not
[19:13.160 --> 19:16.480]  just the United States look at what's going on in Japan this is a report from
[19:16.480 --> 19:22.520]  the Guardian the Prime Minister there Abe has put in a law that will
[19:22.520 --> 19:28.640]  essentially jail civil servants who leak state secrets up to 10 years in prison
[19:28.640 --> 19:34.480]  journalists who encourage whistleblowers to leak could get up to five years say
[19:34.480 --> 19:38.480]  it's the whistleblowers and the journalists are going to go to jail not
[19:38.480 --> 19:41.840]  the criminals who are torturing not the people who are running the dark
[19:41.840 --> 19:46.720]  operations who are funding the drug war not the people who are actually breaking
[19:46.720 --> 19:50.000]  the law but the people who expose them they want to go to jail but you know
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.800]  what the people that go to jail have a clear conscience I haven't seen one of
[19:54.800 --> 19:58.400]  them yet regret that they blew the whistle they don't want to go to jail but
[19:58.400 --> 20:03.360]  they have the moral high ground and give the gift that keeps on giving an in-home

[24:16.360 --> 24:21.200]  this Thursday we're gonna be talking to Joe Biggs in the next segment he's gonna
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.400]  talk to us about what happened what he saw at the ground level I want to look
[24:25.400 --> 24:29.080]  at the big picture right now about this torture report what does this tell us
[24:29.080 --> 24:33.320]  about our government and of course as I pointed out in the last segment just like
[24:33.320 --> 24:38.280]  the Federal Reserve there's the illusion of control over the CIA because we have
[24:38.280 --> 24:41.640]  these public hearings where they appoint the head of the Federal Reserve or
[24:41.640 --> 24:46.800]  they appoint the head of the CIA but there's never any accountability there's
[24:46.800 --> 24:52.520]  never any visibility they both operate in secret and have massive power to
[24:52.520 --> 24:58.400]  control and destroy lives to control and destroy the economy they both operate
[24:58.400 --> 25:03.920]  totally in secret and there is no real auditing of them this report that came
[25:03.920 --> 25:09.760]  out is nothing but a bunch of contradictory lies whitewashing anybody
[25:09.760 --> 25:14.320]  but the CIA of any responsibility because of course again CIA can't be
[25:14.320 --> 25:19.360]  punished the CIA is above the law but they don't want any presidents or people
[25:19.360 --> 25:23.440]  who are currently serving to get in any trouble but take a look at some of the
[25:23.440 --> 25:26.640]  main characters that were involved in this and as I point out the only person
[25:26.640 --> 25:30.720]  who's gone to jail was the person who blew the whistle on this but look at
[25:30.720 --> 25:33.760]  where we what we've got now we've got John Brennan who's the current head of
[25:33.760 --> 25:38.680]  the CIA this was somebody who at the very beginning was involved in all of this
[25:38.680 --> 25:43.800]  in terms of apologizing for the torture he was somebody that Obama wanted to put
[25:43.800 --> 25:48.560]  into place back in 2008 and when he came back five years later he didn't put him
[25:48.560 --> 25:52.480]  in charge of the CIA at that time he had nominated somebody else but they kind of
[25:52.480 --> 25:57.000]  played musical chairs with the power elite they rotated him back in the
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.760]  position five years later so people wouldn't really understand that Obama's
[26:01.760 --> 26:08.600]  talk about controlling the CIA the torture the foreign wars was all just a
[26:08.600 --> 26:15.000]  sham for his voters it was all just a lie and they didn't want to have him in
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.200]  and in 2008 and as this analysis from Frieder's Conner Friedersdorf and the
[26:21.200 --> 26:24.880]  Atlantic pointed out when they were looking at the confirmation hearings of
[26:24.880 --> 26:30.920]  Brennan in 2013 he said back in 2008 Andrew Sullivan said when Obama first
[26:30.920 --> 26:34.960]  considered Brennan as CIA chief Andrew Sullivan said if Obama picks him it will
[26:34.960 --> 26:38.800]  be a vindication of the kind of ambivalence and institutional moral
[26:38.800 --> 26:44.080]  cowardice that made America a torturing nation it would be an
[26:44.080 --> 26:49.560]  unforgivable betrayal of his supporters and his ideals and then Conner Friedersdorf
[26:49.560 --> 26:55.120]  points out that five years later Andrew Sullivan doesn't want to oppose his
[26:55.120 --> 27:01.120]  nomination saying people change well you know what Brennan didn't change the
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.920]  people who changed are people like Andrew Sullivan and the ACLU who were
[27:05.920 --> 27:10.920]  right at one point in time on this issue but then changed their minds the ACLU's
[27:10.920 --> 27:17.840]  response to this Senate report was to say that we need to have Obama pardon the
[27:17.840 --> 27:22.280]  people involved because what he's doing now is he's tacitly pardoning them by
[27:22.280 --> 27:25.560]  not taking any action not putting anybody in jail not prosecuting anyone
[27:25.560 --> 27:30.480]  not even firing anybody so that's a very dangerous thing we need to at least
[27:30.480 --> 27:34.920]  say that laws were broken and that would be a good thing if we could even
[27:34.920 --> 27:40.280]  admit that laws are broken you can't even get that in America but that's what's
[27:40.280 --> 27:44.800]  happened to the opposition they've just rolled over and laid down for all of
[27:44.800 --> 27:48.000]  this they won't talk about it being immoral they won't talk about it being
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.520]  illegal they won't talk about anybody being fired or going to jail the only
[27:52.520 --> 27:56.840]  person who's saying anything even close to that is Mark Udall who's very upset
[27:56.840 --> 28:01.440]  he's not coming back either he did not win his reelection and so he's taken
[28:01.440 --> 28:07.400]  some parting shots at the CIA he says the CIA lied to the public and John
[28:07.400 --> 28:11.560]  Brennan must quit says outgoing senator in a fiery speech this is an article
[28:11.560 --> 28:15.800]  from the Guardian he accused the CIA and the White House and that would be the
[28:15.800 --> 28:21.400]  Obama White House of lying about brutal CIA interrogations and continuing to
[28:21.400 --> 28:25.520]  cover them up yes that's exactly right and I'm glad to see that he's I
[28:25.520 --> 28:30.280]  disagree with him on many issues but you know we need to stand with people when
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.280]  they're doing the right thing even if they're only right on one issue Mark
[28:33.280 --> 28:36.680]  Udall has been really solid on this at one point time he was saying that he was
[28:36.680 --> 28:42.280]  going to read the entire classified report 6,000 pages into the Senate record
[28:42.280 --> 28:47.560]  they said the last time that happened was by Alaska Senator Mike Gravel back in
[28:47.560 --> 28:51.040]  the 1970s he read the Pentagon Papers into the record he could have done that
[28:51.040 --> 28:55.920]  he chose not to do that but he they said he was clearly very angry he said the
[28:55.920 --> 29:00.200]  CIA has lied to its overseers and the public know there aren't any overseers
[29:00.200 --> 29:06.800]  of the CIA and to say that John Brennan must quit is not strong enough John
[29:06.800 --> 29:12.120]  Brennan needs to go to jail not pasco not collect $200 but the only thing we've
[29:12.120 --> 29:17.200]  got on this monopoly board are get out of jail free cards now think about the
[29:17.200 --> 29:21.840]  people who are in charge of this we got the current head of the CIA is John
[29:21.840 --> 29:26.200]  Brennan the current head of Homeland Security is J. Johnson he was involved
[29:26.200 --> 29:32.120]  as an attorney for the Department of Defense giving legal cover to this by
[29:32.120 --> 29:35.400]  there so they put him in charge of domestic law enforcement with Homeland
[29:35.400 --> 29:39.480]  Security the other person involved with this covering it up allowing it to
[29:39.480 --> 29:45.240]  happen at the time was James Comey head of the FBI this is coming to America
[29:45.240 --> 29:50.400]  we're gonna be right back with Joe Biggs stay with us we're on the March the

[33:31.120 --> 33:35.640]  talk about his personal experience what he saw as far as torture goes just
[33:35.640 --> 33:39.400]  before the break I was talking about torture at the highest level and I
[33:39.400 --> 33:43.440]  want to get back into that as we start talking about this Joe but before I do
[33:43.440 --> 33:48.520]  want to let you know about our secret 12 which is now back in stock it's been
[33:48.520 --> 33:52.600]  sold out for weeks we have a very difficult proprietary processing to get
[33:52.600 --> 33:56.200]  it in but it's back in limited supply this is the last shipment we're going
[33:56.200 --> 34:00.560]  to get until 2015 and it can take anywhere from weeks or months now we're
[34:00.560 --> 34:04.480]  talking about secret governments and secret tortures but there's no secret
[34:04.480 --> 34:10.440]  here that B12 is very very important for your nutrition with this is
[34:10.440 --> 34:15.480]  nutraceutical grade proprietary B12 it's taken by mouth no needles no
[34:15.480 --> 34:20.440]  injections and it's got two forms of bioactive and super powerful B12
[34:20.440 --> 34:24.240]  secure years now before we blast it out to our list tonight we expect our
[34:24.240 --> 34:29.440]  limited supply to sell out and you can get it by Christmas if you get it by
[34:29.440 --> 34:33.080]  December 17th so we're getting pretty close to that deadline if you're going
[34:33.080 --> 34:37.920]  to get anything from the info wars store you need to get it by December 17th for
[34:37.920 --> 34:42.080]  guaranteed Christmas delivery now Joe before the break I was talking about
[34:42.080 --> 34:47.040]  how the people that we see now as head of the CIA head of Homeland Security
[34:47.040 --> 34:53.160]  head of the FBI these are guys who are all doing cover for all this torture at
[34:53.160 --> 34:56.960]  the top level now of course we're told by this whitewash report from Senator
[34:56.960 --> 35:02.480]  Feinstein that nobody knew nobody knew I mean for for 10 years we've been talking
[35:02.480 --> 35:06.240]  about this at least okay everybody's been talking about what's going on but and
[35:06.240 --> 35:09.720]  complaining about it but of course the White House didn't know until after
[35:09.720 --> 35:13.840]  legal clearance was given and then they told George push about it Colin Powell
[35:13.840 --> 35:17.800]  didn't know about any of this those are reports we're seeing from NBC these are
[35:17.800 --> 35:22.040]  people who should know about yeah exactly so if they didn't know about that then
[35:22.040 --> 35:25.360]  what are they doing in the position that they're in I mean at least they should
[35:25.360 --> 35:30.120]  be fired but of course nobody is going to go to jail for me this instead not
[35:30.120 --> 35:33.480]  only is nobody gonna get punished not only is nobody gonna get shamed and I
[35:33.480 --> 35:36.600]  think that was a big part of this of course Diane Feinstein was very angry
[35:36.600 --> 35:40.240]  that she got spied on her staff got spied on when they were doing this
[35:40.240 --> 35:43.320]  investigation they took years to look at this they've been looking at it for
[35:43.320 --> 35:47.800]  over six years I think they spent like 40 60 million dollars on just their staff
[35:47.800 --> 35:50.080]  to investigate this they were complaining about the fact that they had
[35:50.080 --> 35:53.920]  outside contractors who were paid 80 million dollars John Brennan said it
[35:53.920 --> 35:58.480]  wasn't spying it was searching they were just searching searching okay yeah this
[35:58.480 --> 36:02.000]  is something Kurt Nemo's got a story up on info wars.com today
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.820]  Nazis designed the torture instruments for maintenance of CIA's terror war
[36:06.820 --> 36:11.480]  charade he points out that this goes all the way back to the operation paper
[36:11.480 --> 36:17.160]  clip and even further than that it goes back to the Nazi regime of 1937 they
[36:17.160 --> 36:21.400]  actually had a German term for enhanced interrogation something they could do
[36:21.400 --> 36:26.880]  that would essentially not show up and cause any embarrassment for the people
[36:26.880 --> 36:32.760]  and then as a reporter he cites here Annie Jacobson says former Nazis were at
[36:32.760 --> 36:35.640]  the forefront of developing torture techniques for the US government same
[36:35.640 --> 36:40.480]  thing we've seen with the biochemical weapons that were brought into Fort
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.840]  Dietrich and other places they brought these guys in from Germany from Japan
[36:45.840 --> 36:50.160]  who had been experimenting on people they brought them in and made them the
[36:50.160 --> 36:55.160]  core of our bio weapons research they also did the same thing at the CIA
[36:55.160 --> 36:59.640]  making them the core of torture they say the work took place at a clandestine
[36:59.640 --> 37:03.720]  facility in the American zone of Occupy Germany called Camp King the
[37:03.720 --> 37:07.840]  facilities chief medical doctor was operation paper clips Dr. Walter
[37:07.840 --> 37:12.440]  Schreiber former surgeon general of the Third Reich and the activities that
[37:12.440 --> 37:17.920]  went on in Camp King between 46 and the late 50s have been never fully
[37:17.920 --> 37:22.640]  accounted for by the Department of Defense or by the CIA just as we're
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.800]  seeing today so this is something that is a long-standing problem it's not
[37:26.800 --> 37:31.040]  something we're just learning about from Diane Feinstein what Diane Feinstein is
[37:31.040 --> 37:35.520]  trying to do is to give herself and Republicans immunity from prosecution
[37:35.520 --> 37:39.360]  and blame it all on the CIA and then the CIA nothing happens to them because they
[37:39.360 --> 37:44.320]  can say everything is a matter of national security well the people they
[37:44.320 --> 37:49.240]  put in charge of the the saltbox area overseas where they were interrogating
[37:49.240 --> 37:53.160]  people they said that the person they put in charge had never even worked in
[37:53.160 --> 37:58.280]  interrogations and or worked around prisoners hmm so you're gonna put these
[37:58.280 --> 38:02.480]  people in charge of trying to get human intelligence and they have no clue what
[38:02.480 --> 38:06.240]  they're doing whatsoever let's talk about what you saw there because when you
[38:06.240 --> 38:12.560]  and I went to Ford AP Hill and we were looking at the American replica city
[38:12.560 --> 38:17.200]  that they have built there for the military to train and for police to
[38:17.200 --> 38:21.760]  train against the American people and that's where this is all coming folks
[38:21.760 --> 38:26.040]  make no mistake about it we talk about the fact that the head of Homeland
[38:26.040 --> 38:31.640]  Security the head of the FBI these are guys who were involved in making legal
[38:31.640 --> 38:35.560]  excuses to try to give legal cover for this torture operation they were
[38:35.560 --> 38:40.640]  rewarded they were promoted to the head of our civilian law enforcement
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.680]  agencies so we were at this training facility looking at what they had there
[38:45.680 --> 38:48.280]  in terms of buildings and we came across the building and you said that looks
[38:48.280 --> 38:52.640]  very much like the building that we used to deliver people to for what you
[38:52.640 --> 38:55.880]  believe was tortured well we'll think about this ten years ago when I went
[38:55.880 --> 39:00.640]  through training to go to theater Iraq that the places we trained that look
[39:00.640 --> 39:05.800]  just like it here we are you know ten twelve years later and everything looks
[39:05.800 --> 39:09.360]  like small-town America yes and now I'm seeing some of those same things
[39:09.360 --> 39:14.960]  integrated from combat theater overseas now into these training exercise areas
[39:14.960 --> 39:18.840]  like Fort A.P. Hill or like the one at Camp Lejeune where now you're seeing
[39:18.840 --> 39:24.440]  these torture chambers being put into small-town USA training areas and
[39:24.440 --> 39:28.120]  then we have the Marines out in LA conducting all these raids as well so
[39:28.120 --> 39:32.360]  it's scary what it looks like it's coming to yeah and on the very same day
[39:32.360 --> 39:37.760]  that Diane Feinstein releases her report they pass the NDAA again for the
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.840]  fourth time under her leadership and of course that's going to have indefinite
[39:42.840 --> 39:48.720]  attention by the military without trial presumably rendition as well as torture
[39:48.720 --> 39:52.840]  but all be included in that anybody that they claim is an enemy combatant and
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.520]  then we see today that they have just tried to give themselves legal cover to
[39:57.520 --> 40:01.560]  spy on all Americans communications without ever pretending that they need
[40:01.560 --> 40:05.640]  to go before a judge or get any any verification from that in terms of a
[40:05.640 --> 40:09.560]  subpoena or a court order as required by the Constitution they just ignore the
[40:09.560 --> 40:13.480]  Constitution and pass their law well it was interesting for me David when I was
[40:13.480 --> 40:17.440]  overseas we would catch people who we knew and I could tell with a gut
[40:17.440 --> 40:21.200]  feeling and seeing the things that they've done were bad people we would
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.560]  catch them and they would release them two three days later mm-hmm now people
[40:25.560 --> 40:31.600]  that for beyond my reasons they would take and torture you know we would
[40:31.600 --> 40:36.600]  release catching releases people who make IDs and things like that people who
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.720]  actually went out and had a record of attacking coalition forces and attacking
[40:41.720 --> 40:45.760]  with us suicide bombers and replacing IDs and small arms attacks complex
[40:45.760 --> 40:50.440]  attacks those people in essence would be hiding put into a biometric scanning
[40:50.440 --> 40:55.600]  system and then released to go back out and continue to do bad stuff but we
[40:55.600 --> 40:59.720]  would take these people from like opium fields and farmers and if they didn't
[40:59.720 --> 41:02.880]  want to play ball they'd come back and they'd go in these rooms and we'd have
[41:02.880 --> 41:06.800]  to sit outside I'd have to hear screaming it's one of those things to
[41:06.800 --> 41:12.320]  hear a grown man scream so much that it goes from screaming to weeping and the
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.520]  scariest part was when it went to silence mm-hmm and you didn't hear
[41:16.520 --> 41:20.240]  anything else again wow and not ever known if that person was gonna come out
[41:20.240 --> 41:23.440]  or not because sometimes they did sometimes they didn't that's just
[41:23.440 --> 41:27.600]  horrific and of course we've seen some new things come out of this in terms of
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.200]  rectal feeding nobody had been talking about that but we've known about the
[41:31.200 --> 41:35.000]  waterboarding for quite some time and one of the things that we were told that
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.040]  they they now say is a lie of course we knew it was a lie that they were getting
[41:39.040 --> 41:42.880]  effective intelligence out of all this when you talk about them catching
[41:42.880 --> 41:47.040]  torturing and releasing the thing that went through my mind was going back to
[41:47.040 --> 41:51.440]  the Vietnam War and I used to hear people that were a little bit older than me
[41:51.440 --> 41:54.720]  that that went there talking about how they would go in and they would take an
[41:54.720 --> 41:58.800]  area and then they would just walk out and leave it again and it's like what's
[41:58.800 --> 42:02.680]  going on with that the only way that that makes any sense is if you understand
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.560]  that the people who are running these wars want it to continue they want it to
[42:07.560 --> 42:11.200]  escalate when you catch these people you torture them and then you release them
[42:11.200 --> 42:16.120]  what are they going to do retaliate exactly exactly and that's what happened
[42:16.120 --> 42:19.520]  with the drone program I think it's amazing that Brennan who is running
[42:19.520 --> 42:23.540]  legal cover for them and was at the CIA he's running legal cover for the
[42:23.540 --> 42:27.600]  enhanced irrigation and of course he's Obama's first choice for CIA director but
[42:27.600 --> 42:31.560]  then postpones it for five years in the meantime he puts him in charge of the
[42:31.560 --> 42:35.240]  drone assassination program and of course he said a lot of interesting
[42:35.240 --> 42:40.000]  things about that in June 2011 current CIA director Brennan claimed US counter
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.920]  terrorism operations had not resulted in quote a single collateral death in the
[42:43.920 --> 42:49.720]  past year then as they look at it goes well alright 45 56 then a little bit
[42:49.720 --> 42:54.720]  later 76 what they said was Brennan claimed that he said we had no
[42:54.720 --> 42:59.200]  information about any civilian non-combatants and what people said was
[42:59.200 --> 43:04.280]  this was based on the assumption that anybody that was military aged any
[43:04.280 --> 43:09.800]  military aged male was a combatant unless proven otherwise you know it's
[43:09.800 --> 43:14.280]  interesting those we release five top Taliban leaders for a Bo Bergdahl and
[43:14.280 --> 43:18.880]  there's still people in Guantanamo that they say they have no reasons to hold
[43:18.880 --> 43:23.400]  them whatsoever and they know that these enhanced torture techniques don't work
[43:23.400 --> 43:27.680]  at all they don't get any viable information whatsoever out of them well
[43:27.680 --> 43:30.680]  one of the things that we had in a story that that came out of one of the
[43:30.680 --> 43:36.280]  quotes that came out of the report was that someone said you're never going to
[43:36.280 --> 43:39.000]  get out of here because we don't want anybody to know what we did to you
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.840]  essentially I'm paraphrasing it but of course that is the key thing and they
[43:43.840 --> 43:47.080]  didn't really try to get to the bottom of anything in the Senate report they
[43:47.080 --> 43:52.040]  didn't interview anybody who was they didn't interview anybody they believe
[43:52.040 --> 43:57.240]  had tortured people with CIA they didn't interview very many if I didn't see the
[43:57.240 --> 44:00.400]  interviewed anybody who was a victim these are reports that we heard of
[44:00.400 --> 44:06.880]  people who who did get released I believe but there wasn't any discussion of
[44:06.880 --> 44:11.280]  of what was going on in any direct sources after six years of this they
[44:11.280 --> 44:15.080]  never talked to anybody that that did this or anybody that suffered from this
[44:15.080 --> 44:19.880]  they just basically gave it a whitewash looking at emails and documents well
[44:19.880 --> 44:23.640]  one night we caught some guys who were in placing IDs we we saw them through our
[44:23.640 --> 44:31.600]  MVGs and put bags over their head zip tied it separate them you know 50 yards
[44:31.600 --> 44:37.080]  apart and then the guys would go up that were with us they they're not regular
[44:37.080 --> 44:40.920]  military I'll say that but go in there and you would see him like poking at him
[44:40.920 --> 44:43.960]  and like you don't speak English to you and you know the guy would just kind of
[44:43.960 --> 44:48.440]  sit there and he's like I bet there's one word you do know though Guantanamo and
[44:48.440 --> 44:52.440]  you see the guys literally urinate themselves in fear because they know
[44:52.440 --> 44:57.080]  that even if no matter what they could do at this point in time they're done
[44:57.080 --> 45:01.040]  their life's over and see that's a key part of it too as Alex said yesterday
[45:01.040 --> 45:06.520]  it's about engendering the fear and it's starting very mildly in America now I
[45:06.520 --> 45:10.080]  can go back and look at a lot of the stuff that they did of course they killed
[45:10.080 --> 45:14.560]  people you know as you mentioned they also they mentioned just one person in
[45:14.560 --> 45:20.040]  this whole report that died from hypothermia because he was left exposed
[45:20.040 --> 45:24.520]  on a cold area concrete floor I'm sure there's many more than that that died
[45:24.520 --> 45:29.240]  and to and I'm not underestimating any of this waterboarding or any other stuff
[45:29.240 --> 45:32.560]  is being truly horrific but some of the stuff that they did was just designed to
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.240]  humiliate people making them wear women's underwear and that's where they
[45:36.240 --> 45:39.960]  want to look at that I look at it and say this is how it's beginning in the
[45:39.960 --> 45:45.680]  US much of what we see going on now with the TSA is merely humiliation it's
[45:45.680 --> 45:50.400]  merely taking away your dignity once they take away your dignity they take away
[45:50.400 --> 45:53.160]  your freedom once they take away your freedom they can torture you they can
[45:53.160 --> 45:57.400]  do anything they want to to you and of course we just had William Benny on
[45:57.400 --> 46:01.480]  again talking to Alex and and he said over and over again that what we have
[46:01.480 --> 46:06.120]  here is not an authoritarian regime but a totalitarian regime and the way that
[46:06.120 --> 46:10.040]  they get there is by grabbing our information and today we see another
[46:10.040 --> 46:15.320]  massive grab if you will of Congress trying to pass a law that presumes to
[46:15.320 --> 46:20.440]  give them the authority to take people's communication it seems like basic
[46:20.440 --> 46:24.760]  training for civilians now that's what the TSA is doing because when your
[46:24.760 --> 46:27.920]  soldier what they do they break you down they humiliate you treat you like crap
[46:27.920 --> 46:31.680]  tell you you're nothing till you get to a point where you're just empty bottomless
[46:31.680 --> 46:35.960]  and all they can do is build you back up the way they want you yes it seems
[46:35.960 --> 46:38.680]  like that's what's starting to happen now with the American public that's what
[46:38.680 --> 46:42.520]  they're trying very good analogy it's all a sigh up it's all a sigh of pulling it
[46:42.520 --> 46:46.800]  down destroying everything taking you down to nothing and then telling and
[46:46.800 --> 46:50.120]  then reconstructing society yeah absolutely you know one of the things
[46:50.120 --> 46:53.880]  that I saw one of the reactions I saw that really stuck out to me was Chris
[46:53.880 --> 46:58.040]  Matthews talking to somebody who was complaining about the torturing says
[46:58.040 --> 47:02.080]  come on you're crazy if you think Al Qaeda is going to stop torturing if we do
[47:02.080 --> 47:07.000]  and I guess the question is how do you tell them the difference between Al
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.640]  Qaeda and the United States he's both torture how do you tell the difference
[47:10.640 --> 47:15.240]  between the United States and the Nazis when we bring them in with operation
[47:15.240 --> 47:19.600]  paperclip as consultants to teach us how to do what they did how do you tell the
[47:19.600 --> 47:24.120]  difference when it's in a course we created also created Al Qaeda child's
[47:24.120 --> 47:29.920]  reaction you put a kid in a toy box and he hits one kid and then that kid
[47:29.920 --> 47:33.400]  retaliates and hits back and goes well mommy he hit me first mm-hmm the same
[47:33.400 --> 47:36.720]  thing they're going well the Taliban does it so you know we might as well do
[47:36.720 --> 47:40.480]  the same thing yeah it's always I forget who said this but somebody said
[47:40.480 --> 47:44.400]  that when you fight monsters you have to be careful that you don't become a
[47:44.400 --> 47:49.200]  monster yourself and I see that happening it's happened in America now we
[47:49.200 --> 47:53.600]  see all these things being done under color of law I think it's interesting to
[47:53.600 --> 47:58.520]  go back and look at let's take a look at the FBI director James Comey and of
[47:58.520 --> 48:02.840]  course he seemed to be somewhat reluctant but he went ahead and played
[48:02.840 --> 48:07.600]  ball he was deputy attorney general at the time the New York Times reported
[48:07.600 --> 48:12.400]  that he argued repeatedly that the US would regret using harsh methods but he
[48:12.400 --> 48:16.520]  went along with the 2005 legal opinion asserting that the techniques used by the
[48:16.520 --> 48:22.000]  CIA were lawful and he gave the green light for the CIA to use all 13 methods
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.120]  of interrogating terrorism suspects including waterboarding and up to 180
[48:26.120 --> 48:31.280]  hours of sleep deprivation so there you go he says it was ready to go out and I
[48:31.280 --> 48:35.560]  concurred and those are emails that the New York Times got about that now what
[48:35.560 --> 48:41.080]  happened to him did he get fired did he get disciplined did he go to jail no he
[48:41.080 --> 48:46.560]  got promoted to the head of the FBI so that happens in America apparently yeah
[48:46.560 --> 48:49.400]  that's that's what they want that's what they want we look at the other guy the
[48:49.400 --> 48:53.840]  guy who's head of Homeland Security Jay Johnson he was general counsel for the
[48:53.840 --> 48:58.400]  DoD he defended in the AA indefinite detention because that's the other part
[48:58.400 --> 49:02.640]  of this okay that's where it's going to be applied to Americans because of
[49:02.640 --> 49:08.800]  course the the they're claiming that the entire world including domestic soil
[49:08.800 --> 49:13.280]  here is at a state of war so they're going to involve the military and we're
[49:13.280 --> 49:19.080]  going to have the same kind of rules of engagement that we saw happened in these
[49:19.080 --> 49:23.000]  these in Iraq and Afghanistan with the CIA they're going to essentially do the
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.880]  same thing and this came out of the report talking about how in February
[49:26.880 --> 49:31.240]  2012 the administration represented by Jay Johnson general counsel of the US
[49:31.240 --> 49:35.600]  Department of Defense to find the term associated forces so that they could
[49:35.600 --> 49:41.200]  apply it to essentially anybody with the NDAA this is the guy who then
[49:41.200 --> 49:44.960]  subsequently becomes the head of Homeland Security and evidently is going
[49:44.960 --> 49:50.160]  to be passing for Obama when he didn't even sign his executive order he's
[49:50.160 --> 49:53.480]  going to leave it to Jay Johnson you can already see the transformation though
[49:53.480 --> 49:57.160]  going from combat overseas of what's going on now with our militarized
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.080]  police as well though yes the shoot first ask questions maybe down the road at
[50:01.080 --> 50:04.680]  some point in time yes but nine times out of ten like you said these cops do
[50:04.680 --> 50:08.800]  bad stuff they don't get indicted sweep it under the rug and move on and they're
[50:08.800 --> 50:12.120]  desperate they're desperate to arm the police it's not only the training not
[50:12.120 --> 50:15.920]  only how they're teaching them that they're operating in a war zone that the
[50:15.920 --> 50:20.040]  public is the enemy as I pointed out before they said the whole idea that
[50:20.040 --> 50:24.000]  they hadn't killed anybody who was innocent and he there wasn't any
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.640]  collateral damage as a Pentagon being choked to death on on the ground by
[50:27.640 --> 50:32.000]  police officers torture to me exactly and when you look at this the attitude
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.800]  that they had in country saying that if anybody was a military age male there
[50:35.800 --> 50:38.880]  was a presumption that they were not innocent and that's the way they're
[50:38.880 --> 50:42.240]  policing the inner city I've heard that many times when we're overseas they're
[50:42.240 --> 50:46.480]  like hey that's an old enough guy he could be a militant watch him yeah take
[50:46.480 --> 50:50.480]  him out if he's not if he makes a move yeah which reminds us that of course
[50:50.480 --> 50:55.600]  people who are military age males are the militia and that's what's going to
[50:55.600 --> 50:59.600]  essentially be the only effect that we have to stand against this tyranny we'll

[54:15.240 --> 54:19.440]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here with Staff Sergeant
[54:19.440 --> 54:24.140]  retired Joe Biggs and we're talking about what he saw on the ground in
[54:24.140 --> 54:28.880]  terms of torture we've been looking at the people who are at the top of this
[54:28.880 --> 54:33.320]  providing legal cover who have not been shamed they've not been punished they've
[54:33.320 --> 54:39.600]  not been demoted or fired no they've been promoted to the positions of head of
[54:39.600 --> 54:45.240]  the CIA head of the FBI head of Homeland Security that's what happens when you
[54:45.240 --> 54:49.160]  cover for these people they basically move you up one of the things I was
[54:49.160 --> 54:51.880]  looking at in the torture report they were talking about the memorandum of
[54:51.880 --> 54:56.720]  notification it seems to me it was more restrictive than even what they've put in
[54:56.720 --> 55:00.920]  with the NDAA they had a quote in there where it says we are not permitted they
[55:00.920 --> 55:05.600]  said to detain someone merely upon a suspicion that he or she has valuable
[55:05.600 --> 55:10.060]  information about terrorists or planned acts of terrorism and yet they've been
[55:10.060 --> 55:16.600]  given a much broader range in the NDAA they say merely they have to suspect
[55:16.600 --> 55:19.560]  that there's substantial support and as you're pointing out they were just
[55:19.560 --> 55:22.920]  going out and rounding people up torturing them and releasing them
[55:22.920 --> 55:28.200]  they're essentially poking both sides of the war just as we've seen them do in
[55:28.200 --> 55:31.880]  Vietnam as we've seen them do in every kind of conflict we've got the CIA
[55:31.880 --> 55:37.440]  operating here secretly as an unaccountable compartmentalized government
[55:37.440 --> 55:41.440]  that is over and above the people who presumably have some oversight over them
[55:41.440 --> 55:46.120]  or a point the head of the CIA I mean there is no oversight and we're not
[55:46.120 --> 55:50.000]  going to see even the kind of oversight that we saw out of this report once
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.120]  Richard Burr gets in because he's publicly gone on record saying that he
[55:53.120 --> 55:57.280]  doesn't think there's ever anything that the CIA does that ought to be made
[55:57.280 --> 56:02.120]  public yeah that that that's out of control yeah you know like you said
[56:02.120 --> 56:05.160]  that the head of the FBI the head of the CIA they should call that group they
[56:05.160 --> 56:08.880]  should call these guys monsters ink yeah because that's all they are it's just an
[56:08.880 --> 56:14.800]  incorporation of monsters just it's a mind-blowing to know the fact that they
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.680]  can go on national TV and swear in the oath that things like this aren't
[56:19.680 --> 56:23.120]  happening yes and to say that and to look in the eyes of the American people
[56:23.120 --> 56:29.600]  and just blatantly lie I just don't understand it especially when I've been
[56:29.600 --> 56:32.640]  out there and I've seen it happen I've seen it happen since Obama's been
[56:32.640 --> 56:37.760]  president numerous times yeah nothing changed after Obama got in and we're
[56:37.760 --> 56:41.040]  gonna talk later in the program yes absolutely we're gonna talk later in
[56:41.040 --> 56:44.880]  the program about how the GOP has betrayed their voters who wanted them
[56:44.880 --> 56:50.840]  to get control of the illegal amnesty program to shut down Obamacare to do
[56:50.840 --> 56:54.840]  so many things and basically let people look and see what's in spending bills
[56:54.840 --> 56:59.240]  we've had now two separate weeks where they basically introduced something on
[56:59.240 --> 57:03.520]  a Tuesday night late 1600 page bill and said we've got to pass it by Thursday
[57:03.520 --> 57:08.040]  giving congressmen and the press and the public only a few hours to look at
[57:08.040 --> 57:10.520]  what's in it we're going to look at some of the things that have already shown
[57:10.520 --> 57:12.920]  up in the bill of course there's not enough time for everybody to know
[57:12.920 --> 57:17.000]  everything that's in it but there's some horrendous stuff in that and Obama did
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.920]  the same thing to his supporters a lot of people voted for him because they
[57:20.920 --> 57:24.840]  wanted to end the torture that was going on they wanted to end the wars and yet
[57:24.840 --> 57:29.240]  he's given us more wars he's continued the torture he added the drone program
[57:29.240 --> 57:33.000]  and put one of the guys who was giving legal cover for the torture program in
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.120]  charge of the drone program who is now the head of the CIA John Brennan it just
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.760]  keeps going and now they're going to send more troops yes Iraq yeah you know
[57:41.760 --> 57:45.160]  that we're going to shut that down he says we're going to close down Guantanamo
[57:45.160 --> 57:48.000]  we're going to do all this I haven't seen anything that happened yet and it's
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.400]  only getting worse and it's going to continue to get worse here in America
[57:51.400 --> 57:55.200]  because like I said we're making a transformation from combat life overseas
[57:55.200 --> 57:59.840]  and that's starting to pop up here in the homeland as well that's what people
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.240]  need to understand they need to understand that this was merely training
[58:03.240 --> 58:07.600]  and preparation they need to see how all of the groundwork is being laid for a
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.320]  massive tyranny here how the NDA and and the legislation that was passed today
[58:12.320 --> 58:15.760]  that's all going to be used against the American public you and I saw it there
[58:15.760 --> 58:19.080]  at the training facility when we come back right after the break we're going
[58:19.080 --> 58:24.200]  to talk about some more stuff that you saw in Afghanistan and Iraq because
[58:24.200 --> 58:28.640]  that's what's missing there's not any interview of the people who are there
[58:28.640 --> 58:34.200]  who saw that nothing of the the people who were victims of that nobody who did
[58:34.200 --> 58:37.720]  it is being called in for questioning only the whistleblower who exposed it
[58:37.720 --> 58:40.880]  goes to prison we'll be right back
[58:40.880 --> 58:48.920]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN Live.com today
[58:48.920 --> 58:54.400]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[58:54.400 --> 58:57.920]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[58:57.920 --> 59:02.000]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.480]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90%
[59:06.480 --> 59:10.040]  of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[59:10.040 --> 59:14.200]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[59:14.200 --> 59:17.960]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[59:17.960 --> 59:21.320]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[59:21.320 --> 59:25.040]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[59:25.040 --> 59:29.440]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[59:29.440 --> 59:33.320]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild
[59:33.320 --> 59:37.600]  cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA the new Info Wars live lung
[59:37.600 --> 59:41.000]  cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.360]  throughout any toxic environment now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com

[59:50.680 --> 59:57.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:13.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:21.680]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:24.080]  Jones
[1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:30.560]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight join the studio with Joe
[1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:34.560]  Biggs we've been talking about the torture report that was released of course
[1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:40.400]  it is yet another step in the cover-up of two administrations that should help
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:44.360]  you to get out of your left right Republican Democrat paradigm to
[1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:48.160]  understand this is something's gone on with two administrations you've got the
[1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:52.160]  Obama administration covering for the Bush administration and this is part of
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:57.520]  the cover-up it's a massive whitewash it excuses Feinstein who had oversight
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:01.520]  during this time it excuses Bush those in the Bush administration one of the
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:04.480]  things that they say and this is interesting Joe number seven out of
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:09.000]  their 20 findings the CIA impeded effective White House oversight and
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:14.800]  decision-making and yet they point out later in the report that back in 2008
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:19.680]  even after the Congress the House and the Senate had approved legislation to
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:23.600]  stop what they were doing essentially limited to what was approved interrogation
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:27.560]  methods out of the Army Field Manual that was vetoed by President Bush and
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:31.560]  of course we all know that they knew about this for a very long time we've
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:38.720]  had a the former chief lawyer of the CIA Rizzo was wrote a book called company
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:43.440]  man and in it he talks about how he provided the cover for enhanced
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:46.600]  interrogation that was a major part of the book but of course in the book came
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:50.680]  out everybody focus on the sensational aspects that there was some Hollywood big
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:57.280]  name star that got paid $50,000 in cocaine to work for the CIA completely
[1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:01.680]  ignoring the lies of this guy used for enhanced interrogation and of course the
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:05.560]  CIA according to him destroyed most of the detainee interrogation video tapes
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:10.160]  back in 2005 so they knew about this stuff for a long time but you talked
[1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:13.440]  about your what you saw personally there you talked about how people brought
[1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:17.440]  out bags over their head they didn't speak English they threatened them with
[1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:21.520]  Guantanamo scared them to death talk about some of the other things that you
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:25.880]  saw there was a program that started coming into effect a couple months
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:28.720]  before I left so I was involved with it and I was one of the people who was
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:32.360]  considered and need to know about it most of soldiers in my unit had no idea
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:37.240]  the operation was even going on they just knew that we were going missions at
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:42.560]  night and grab people and it's a program called Rocky now Rocky what Rocky is
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:46.520]  is an anti any tank mine it looks like what we do we go we buried on the side
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:50.440]  of the road it's got a tracking device in it so what they do is and they take
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:55.880]  that information they track that any tank mine to a house now we've gone into
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:03:00.400]  these places numerous times and there's no proof that these are ID making
[1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:03.880]  facilities that look like just people had come across it and decided to get it
[1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:07.240]  off the road to maybe stop someone from running over it and getting hurt because
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:09.880]  you got a lot of people out there who really are just nice people who want to
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:16.320]  live a regular life and we would go and get those people and they would take them
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:20.560]  and I think that from the bottom of my heart it feels like they were using a
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:26.440]  lot of these local nationals in Afghanistan as just practice yes yes
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:31.520]  that's the key that's the thing like I said practice for America practice for
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:35.440]  other wars but we have to understand that that dagger is pointed at our throat
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:39.960]  we have to understand that people have to it was just amazing what you and I
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:44.560]  went through at AP Hill when the security guard let us in and we were able to
[1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:47.600]  walk through that facility and see what they had set up and of course there's
[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:52.040]  another one that's got slightly different kind of approach in North
[1:03:52.040 --> 1:03:56.440]  Carolina I think it was Camp Lejeune Marine Base yeah that one is a more
[1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:00.840]  rural suburban approach this one was more urban it had things that you would
[1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:05.880]  find in a city but of course it had a church it had a mosque exactly I mean
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:10.720]  underground subway it was really bizarre as we walk through that and the the
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:14.920]  lights were working you know it's like this abandoned city and of course we
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:19.120]  expected at any moment somebody was gonna have an issue come come run down
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:22.520]  us but we said they're at the corner of first and main looking at what they're
[1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:25.840]  training for for America and this is what they were training for in
[1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:30.160]  Afghanistan well there in Iraq as well I mean like I said we would catch these
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:35.360]  bad guys and we I would see them in placing IEDs we would release them yeah
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:39.400]  we would take people who had nothing to do with it and they would be taken in the
[1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:43.680]  room sometimes and like I said you would hear the most god-awful screams I
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:47.080]  wake up in the middle of the night here and then I get goosebumps even while
[1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:49.680]  talking about it yeah we're gonna be right back after the break we're going
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:54.440]  to talk about another story that Joe is involved in this one about abortion stay
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:57.640]  with us we're gonna be right back
[1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:05.080]  as the year is coming to a close we all pause to reflect on what's happened in

[1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:07.640]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:14.280]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:19.120]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight join the studio with Joe
[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:23.480]  Biggs we've been talking about the torture non-report the what I believe
[1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:28.400]  is a whitewash still not going to do anything to the CIA if you look at the
[1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:31.560]  20 points every single one of them starts out the CIA did this the CIA did
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:38.080]  that very mild accusations for the most part most of it there to excuse people
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:41.840]  to say well you know the House didn't know about it Senate didn't know about it
[1:08:41.840 --> 1:08:44.680]  they were hiding it from us the presidents didn't even know about Bush
[1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:47.520]  didn't know about it and then Obama didn't know about it when he covered up
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:53.520]  for Bush administration's crimes but of course it all boils down to I think the
[1:08:53.520 --> 1:09:00.880]  lack Joe of a a valuing life you know we don't have the sanctity of life the
[1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:05.160]  founders always connected life and liberty talking about them as being
[1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:09.280]  part of our inalienable rights when we look at how this is a psychological
[1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:12.800]  operation with this torture stuff as you pointed out they want to destroy
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:17.360]  people's self-respect they want to take their dignity because then they can take
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:20.880]  your freedom they can build you back up as you pointed out it's like a boot camp
[1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:25.560]  for the American public what we see going on with the TSA the milder forms of
[1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:29.040]  torture that we saw from the TSA where they were basically designed to
[1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:33.480]  humiliate and strike fear into the hearts of the people very much a
[1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:37.400]  psychological operation of course B.F. Skinner used to talk about moving beyond
[1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:42.160]  freedom and dignity we had to get rid of those notions and treat people like
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:46.280]  animals that's what this is really fundamentally about and at the heart of
[1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:50.320]  all that of course is abortion because that's part of the training of teaching
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:55.040]  us not to respect life and you did this man on a street in that University of
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:00.040]  Texas here in Austin and it got picked up by the Texas right to life saying
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:04.520]  look at what these kids are willing to do they're willing to sign a petition
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:08.280]  saying that kids can be aborted up to the age of five years old it wasn't hard
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:12.200]  at all for you to get that done was it if that was shocking you know it was one
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:16.400]  of those things and I said this before it ate away at my soul in my heart yeah
[1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:21.040]  because we saw an article on the College Fix saying that it was a growing trend
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:27.320]  at universities nationwide and I thought to myself all right I can't believe
[1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:31.480]  this but I do need to go out and find out for myself whether or not this is
[1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:37.040]  really something that people can back mm-hmm so we drew up this petition you
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:42.440]  know stating hey you know do you support giving women the right to have post
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:46.680]  birth abortions post birth abortion yeah so after the baby's been born and it
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:50.920]  could be from a botched abortion that didn't work or any other whatever
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:54.520]  happened or at the point that you had the kid and you decide that up till five
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:57.720]  years old that you know I can't handle this anymore then you can still have the
[1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:02.000]  baby aborted so and the reason I say five years old is because a kid you know
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.480]  when you go back and you but it's the first thing you can never remember most
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:10.000]  people go five years old so they say since you're not really aware of what's
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.160]  going on you're not self-aware until you're about five years old that's why
[1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:17.120]  you're not really considered a life even though after you've been born you know
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:21.400]  and one of the statements so when the lady in Florida was lobbying for post
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:28.480]  birth abortions one of the doctors goes well why is this who's right is this and
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:31.960]  she goes well that's the right between the doctor and the patient whether or
[1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:35.240]  not they would want to have a post birth abortion and I like what the guy brought
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:39.240]  up he goes well once the baby is on the table laying there kicking screaming
[1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:43.800]  and crying isn't that the patient yes doesn't that patient now have rights and
[1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:47.840]  you're going to murder it you know it all boils down to the discussion of
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:52.720]  personhood and as a libertarian I used to buy the argument that well you know
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:56.160]  people we don't really know if it's a person or whatever at this point until
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:00.000]  it got to partial birth abortion which really in my opinion is post birth
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:04.840]  abortion they would go through the prevarication of pretending that part of
[1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:08.960]  the baby was still inside the mother and then kill the baby but the baby was
[1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:15.000]  essentially full-term able to survive on its own mostly withdrawn and then kill
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.840]  the child and so you just take it to the logical extreme of five years old let's
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:22.400]  just play a little bit of that clip so people remember what we what we did on
[1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:28.600]  that you guys got that clip a lot of people they have botched abortions you
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:34.240]  know what that is and what this is a post birth on the street 2014 she nodded
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:37.640]  her head saying she understands what a post birth abortion is you can take a
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:43.160]  look over it and you see she's sitting there she's looking at it Stephanie right
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:48.320]  and no there's no gun to her head looks like I never forced her to sign this like
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:52.960]  this article we're gonna come to soon says this man has earphones and he's
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:13:01.000]  listening to music why can't you support stuff like that and he read it
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:08.840]  thank your phones and come back to that and why people agree that post birth
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:13.920]  abortion women who have botched abortion sometimes they fail and it's to give
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:18.560]  them the the ability to go in ahead and go through with it after the babies when
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:29.000]  born look at her she's reading it so first of all I can't even I don't even
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:37.080]  have a comment on this ridiculous you want to help give women the right to
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:42.800]  make the decision to have a post birth abortion if they want I'm just reading
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:47.080]  it yeah cool I'm just reading check it out all right it's just a post birth
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:51.080]  abortion what does that mean is if there's a botched abortion and the
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:58.160]  baby's so born they can just do it right then terminate immediately no that's
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:03.320]  wrong the abortion they want to or not and you hear the lady saying don't sign
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:06.640]  that petition the girl that was just there and he goes I know exactly what
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:11.720]  I'm signing because he's read it you have a lot of students here yeah it is
[1:14:11.720 --> 1:14:18.680]  isn't it like no guess what there's people who read this that says they're
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:23.200]  going they're allowing kids up to five years old to be killed like no look
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:38.600]  this came out in the college that you do not agree with this yeah I approach and
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:42.920]  yet I did not get that it was so over-the-top so absurd and yet there
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:48.560]  were very few people punch me smack me threaten to kill me in some kind of way
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:53.000]  because that would be my reaction if you walked up to me and said hey do you
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:57.720]  support killing babies are already born no yeah what kind of insanity is that so
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:02.440]  this gets picked up by Texas right to life looks at this is absolutely amazed
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:07.040]  at what's going on since it's out an email blast and then the Austin statesman
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:11.240]  and politifact picked this up and they're going to do an objective analysis of
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:15.640]  your man on the street report here's their objectivity they describe info
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:21.080]  wars.com as the reporting project shepherded by conspiracy theorist Alex
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:26.680]  Jones we're not a news site a reporting project and then they talk about you as
[1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:30.760]  being these the sports jacketed man and shades so yeah the fact that I have on a
[1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:35.520]  sports jacket and shades means that I'm gonna make people feel more welcome to
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:39.720]  murdering babies yeah this guy that wrote this article is out of his mind so
[1:15:39.720 --> 1:15:44.400]  this is this is political facts objective analysis of that report now
[1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:48.680]  that they say that at your request you email them the page listing the people
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:52.960]  who signed it 13 people who signed it and they go in and they pronounce this as
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:58.720]  being partially accurate but lacking important context they only talk to three
[1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:03.680]  well four people out of the 13 one of them says that they do support the
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:07.360]  concept but for quote-unquote complicated reasons they don't explain what
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:11.840]  those complicated reasons why somebody would still say that when questioned on
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:15.640]  the phone they say yeah I I support abortions up to the age of five and
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:19.760]  then talk about what some of the other people said well imagine this a guy who's
[1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:24.360]  writing an article is calling you about something that you signed mm-hmm and then
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:28.240]  saying are you really four killing babies up until five years old what do you
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:31.800]  think a college kids response is going to be to that yeah of course they're
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:35.240]  going to retract that right off the bat there there was a lady who wants to be a
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:42.760]  politician and I made her clip it's extra long just so political fact and all
[1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:47.600]  them can watch right now and see how long she read that and she's the one the
[1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:50.560]  first one that they talked to yeah Danielle yeah she is the one who want
[1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:55.280]  to be a politician and said that had I fully understood the actual position you
[1:16:55.280 --> 1:16:59.600]  know I wouldn't have signed this I was in a hurry to get the class hey you know I
[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:02.760]  think that's exactly the kind of person we need an office that's exactly the
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:05.440]  kind of person we got in Congress right now they say hey if I would have read
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:08.320]  the bill I would have never done it but we had to get it passed by Thursday though
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:11.840]  they said look look right here she's sitting behind another person signing
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:15.360]  waiting doesn't like she's in a hurry to me she's having a conversation with me
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:19.240]  but oh she's in a lot of a very big hurry to get a class no she sat there the
[1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:23.440]  longest out of anyone mm-hmm and had a conversation with me okay so she's the
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:26.960]  one signing it right now by this looking at it she's in yeah so while this other
[1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:30.320]  person was signing it she's talking to you about this kind I'm asking her what
[1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:33.520]  she's going to do she says she wants to be a future politician you know this is
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:36.680]  the thing we don't we don't take we're not teaching critical thinking anymore
[1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:42.560]  in American universities or in schools mm-hmm it's not my fault if you like to
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:46.120]  use Facebook but on January 1st you decide to go accept the new user terms
[1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:51.200]  and services and then one day when your nudie photos off your phone gets leaked
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:55.320]  out somewhere it's not my fault guess what you hit accept mm-hmm when you sign
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:59.240]  something you endorse it that's your mark saying hey I fully understand this
[1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:03.400]  I'm backing this so as an adult you're in school when you read that you sign
[1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:07.160]  that you can't come back on that that's what you did so that's another issue as
[1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:10.320]  well right there people need to learn to read what they're doing if they say
[1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:13.480]  they're not reading but these people clearly you can see in the video read
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:16.400]  what they were doing and then signed it and as you pointed out when somebody
[1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:20.880]  contacts them personally and says are you really sure that this is really what
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:24.080]  you wanted to do after the fact we're doing a news report on this and I'm from
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:28.640]  Politifact yeah one of these guys still comes back and says you know hey I do
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:32.840]  support it Stephanie Forsberg said that but a guy that they talked to Joseph
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:38.080]  said well quote if the child's already born then aborting the child is kind of
[1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:45.280]  wrong kind of wrong see they can't even get to the idea that it's that it's
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:49.680]  murder and I think for the longest time you know I talked to my wife about it at
[1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:53.160]  the time that she was working with a pro-life organization and saying if they
[1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:56.480]  really want to change people's minds and get people to understand what's going on
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:19:03.480]  they need to fund a better imaging system and we now have that for the
[1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:08.480]  ultrasound lets you see three-dimensional pictures of the baby in the mother you
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:13.160]  can see it's fully formed it's moving around you can see that now you have no
[1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:17.800]  excuse to think that this is some evolutionary form of development that
[1:19:17.800 --> 1:19:22.360]  was something that that goes all the way back to the 1800s where you had
[1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:25.800]  somebody who was trying to sell Darwin's theory of evolution came up with the
[1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:31.640]  idea that ontology recoupage phylogeny recapitulates ontology I think his way
[1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:35.120]  went essentially saying they're going through evolutionary stages so when few
[1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:39.240]  abort this child you're not aborting a human you're aborting a baby fish or
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:43.360]  you're aborting a bird or something on something lower form those drawings that
[1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:47.680]  he came up with have been shown to be a lie everything about this is based on a
[1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:50.680]  lie we're gonna talk a little bit more with Joe Viggs about this report right
[1:19:50.680 --> 1:19:54.120]  after the break we're gonna talk about snopes how did they become the

[1:24:11.640 --> 1:24:15.360]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I have Joe Biggs with me
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:19.520]  of course we've been talking an hour ago we were talking about his personal
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:24.080]  experiences seeing what the U.S. military was doing abroad with torture
[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:28.240]  because that's a key component of this that's missing and that is they can
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:32.920]  tell us about the techniques that are going on but we need to hear from the
[1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:37.000]  individuals who were tortured we need to see the people who did it punished we
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.080]  need to understand that this is a fraud and yet this Senate report that goes
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:45.800]  out is merely removing blame from anybody that could be punished for this
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:51.440]  and placing it solely on the CIA which I think the real takeaway from this report
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:56.920]  is that the CIA is clearly above the law they can put everything on the CIA say
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:25:01.280]  the CIA deceived everybody they mismanaged it it was ineffective they
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:04.360]  lied to the public they lied to Congress saying that they were getting real
[1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:07.840]  intelligence from it of course part of that lie was the zero dark 30 movie that
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:12.680]  came out it opens with a graphic scenes of enhanced interrogation as they call
[1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:15.840]  it and then showing that that intelligence is leading to the capture
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:19.440]  bin Laden everything about that of course is a lie I think it's interesting
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:24.200]  that was Sony that's now getting hacked I don't want to get into I know we won't
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:29.440]  get into all that movie I got up and left screaming I was so mad yeah so the
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:34.280]  biggest lie I've ever seen so it's lie on top of lie on top of lie but every one
[1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:38.640]  of these 20 items out of this report basically says the CIA did this the CIA
[1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:42.520]  did that and of course they're going to be immune from any kind of prosecution
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:46.960]  any kind of real auditing or oversight or exposure but then we started talking
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:51.720]  about this report that you did it at the University of Texas went out on man on
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:55.480]  the street asked people if they would sign Texas students if they would sign
[1:25:55.480 --> 1:26:01.600]  this petition supporting abortion up to the age of five and we just showed what
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:06.480]  happened and then we've got political facts coming at us and analyzing it and
[1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:13.280]  of course Snopes who is apparently the arbiter of all truth who is Snopes the
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:17.520]  couple with a cat exactly this article here from accuracy in policy and
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:21.360]  politics points it out they say Snopes is run by a man and a woman with no
[1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:26.280]  background in investigation using Google there you go now you know you don't
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:31.200]  need a degree in investigation to do investigation right but they are not the
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:36.080]  arbiters of truth anybody can go in watch out you might get an alert text
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:40.720]  message on your phone saying they need to stand down exactly I'm a big fan of
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:44.800]  citizen journalism I'm a big fan of everybody investigating everything I
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:48.640]  think everybody ought to do that so I'm not all caught up in journalistic
[1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:52.880]  credentials or that sort of thing but the bottom line is is that they don't
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:59.080]  have any more of a line on the truth any less bias than anybody else who's doing
[1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:03.280]  any research they are not an objective source they're highly leftist with
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:07.040]  everything they come out with which you can see the picture there the man and
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:10.600]  the woman and their cat in the background I guess maybe that do they use
[1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:15.160]  cat entrails to determine so this is true or not I don't know but we're going
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:20.000]  back to this report you were talking about the man with the headphones being
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.080]  significant as to what they say in here yeah well in the article right here it
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:28.680]  says by our sites not everyone is paying attention at least two students act
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:33.120]  while wearing headphones mm-hmm now we can key up this clip in a second you can
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:37.440]  see the gentleman has his headphones in and he clearly is reading it and he
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:42.520]  goes oh that's bad you know I'm not gonna do that so he had his headphones in
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:47.360]  and he had a natural response that this is evil I'm not gonna do that mm-hmm so
[1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:50.360]  I don't know where they get that from in their articles saying that that
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:54.720]  distracted him in any way because he was clearly able yeah you see that right
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:10.720]  now yeah yeah pretty pretty amazing but these things are not unrelated as I
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:15.600]  said before it's having a respect for life having respect for people having
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:18.520]  respect for the sanctity of life when they can go into other countries as
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:23.960]  you're talking about just go out and grab people out of the community in these
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:29.200]  foreign countries bring them in torture them and release them or use the drone
[1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:33.160]  program which John Brennan then moved on he graduated from the enhanced
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:37.760]  interrogation torturing John Brennan moved on to being legal cover for the
[1:28:37.760 --> 1:28:43.000]  drone assassination program essentially saying that it was necessary that they
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.560]  were not getting any collateral damage and he was rewarded for both of those
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:51.280]  things might be put in charge of the CIA where he is now we're not going to see
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:56.000]  anything happen in the CIA are we no no just more torture and more of it moving
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:01.360]  here to American soil exactly and and that's the key thing these are human
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:05.960]  beings and if you can do that to human beings in another country they can and
[1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:09.640]  will do it to human beings in this country it's those rules of engagement
[1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:13.560]  that we now see happening on the street this is what we see happening in the
[1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:16.720]  inner city they're training the police to do this sort of thing and we see that
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:20.840]  the Department of Defense with their section 1033 program putting military
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:24.600]  equipment out there they are desperate to get it in the hands of the police so
[1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:28.760]  desperate that they would even withhold it from fire departments that they've
[1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:32.400]  been giving it to for 60 years they actually need it who actually can use
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:36.680]  it exactly who really need it this is stuff that they don't need in the police
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:40.840]  departments but they're training people to act like they have abroad that's the
[1:29:40.840 --> 1:29:44.120]  scary thing about it when you look at the NDAA when you look at the bills that

[1:33:11.080 --> 1:33:23.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm
[1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:28.360]  David Knight and we just had Joe Biggs in here with us talking about a course of
[1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:33.080]  the torture report but specifically about what he saw in Afghanistan as well
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:39.000]  as this political fact analysis of the man on the street report the man on the
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:42.680]  street report is self-evident how can you say that's not factual and of course
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:48.480]  when they did contact only three of the 13 people one of them said well yeah I
[1:33:48.480 --> 1:33:53.800]  guess it might be kind of wrong to kill somebody up to the age of five another
[1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:59.320]  one said I don't have any problem with that it's complicated we got a special
[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:03.960]  report coming up from Leanne McAdoo and of course we talked about Peter Gruber
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:08.440]  before he was lying to the American public and deceiving them on Obamacare
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:12.760]  there's John Gruber I'm sorry I keeps calling him Peter Gruber because it was
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:17.680]  a Peter Gruber Hollywood producer and I used to be in the video business so I
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:21.920]  keep going that but it's John Gruber of course lied to the American public about
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:27.960]  Obamacare and sold them on that but before that he was actually using the
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:31.040]  kind of arguments that we see being used in abortion clinics all the time you
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:36.480]  can't afford this child if you have this child it's going to have an awful life so
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:41.160]  you're better off just killing this child that's the way they sell abortions
[1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:46.360]  they talk about the marginal child that's actually the the phrase that he
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:50.440]  used and of course that's an economist term we talk about marginal costs and
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:54.880]  marginal benefits in the words have a fixed cost of our factory if we use more
[1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:59.440]  material to make more widgets is that marginal cost going to be offset by a
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:02.920]  marginal benefit so he talks about children and tries to do it in
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:07.840]  economic terms and of course telling people as they go into the abortion
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:11.920]  clinic this child is going to cost you three hundred thousand dollars over its
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:16.200]  life or whatever number they pull out of the air about that as if you're going
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:19.960]  to have to come up with that right away as if that they know what the cost is
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:25.960]  going to be you can't put a price tag on life and you can't treat it with the
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:32.440]  kind of disrespect that we see being done abroad in our name in our names in
[1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:37.840]  the name of the American people and of course as Chris Matthew said are you
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:42.280]  going to stop Al Qaeda from torturing if you unilaterally stop torturing I
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:46.280]  thought the whole idea was we were supposed to be better than terrorists
[1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:50.880]  we're supposed to be better than the Nazis yet we come to find out that it's
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:55.120]  the same bankers who start the wars that are above both of them we find out the
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:36:01.320]  CIA created Al Qaeda they used to call them the Mujahideen but we also see them
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:07.880]  whining and dining bin Laden and Al Zawahiri and the Pentagon until they
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:13.800]  become useful scapegoats for their agenda so it all starts with respect for
[1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:18.400]  life and I want to go to this report next from Leanne McAdoo let's go to that
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:35.160]  now the marginal cost from John Gruber
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:40.840]  Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber is not just satisfied with selling the two
[1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:46.480]  stupid American voters a health care law based on deception and non-transparency
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:53.120]  no now Gruber has been exposed as an abortion advocate of the eugenicist
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:57.520]  variety now during the Clinton years Gruber co-authored a paper titled
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:03.320]  abortion legalization and child living circumstances who is the marginal child
[1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:09.560]  he argues that legal abortion had saved the US taxpayer upwards of 14 billion
[1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:14.720]  dollars in welfare benefits and that it also lowered crime he argues that
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:20.800]  abortion of marginal children is a social good if these marginal children or
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:26.000]  urban poor had been born they would have been more likely to live in a single
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:31.200]  parent household live in poverty die in infancy and be in a household
[1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:36.000]  collecting welfare I was raised by a single mother in low to middle class
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.480]  neighborhood I even grew up some of those years on food stamps but according to
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:45.680]  Jonathan Gruber I would have been better off I had never even been born and this
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:49.480]  is a lie that they sell to these young women that they might as well just get
[1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:52.640]  rid of their children because they'll never be able to make it and they'll
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:56.360]  never rise up out of poverty they won't amounts anything they won't be able to
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:02.040]  afford it so this is just a huge lie and let's point out that this is the same
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:07.720]  exact man who's in charge of drafting our national health care law so you know
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:11.760]  no need to worry about death panels and also remember this there are also those
[1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:17.440]  who claim that our reform efforts would ensure illegal immigrants this too is
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:24.480]  false the reforms the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:27.000]  are here illegal
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:39.360]  and one more misunderstanding I want to clear up under our plan no federal
[1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:44.160]  dollars will be used to fund abortions and federal conscience laws will remain
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:48.480]  in place turns out that was a lie according to a new report from the
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:52.800]  government accountability office obama care is filled with abortion subsidies
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:57.400]  and plans that indirectly fund the procedure forcing taxpayers to
[1:38:57.400 --> 1:39:01.840]  subsidize abortion and as we've reported before most of these abortion
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:07.360]  clinics are set up in black and Hispanic neighborhoods in New York alone
[1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:13.200]  there were more black babies killed by abortion than were born in 2012 and in
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:18.120]  New York alone nearly 78% of all abortions performed were of black or
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:23.200]  Hispanic children now former abortion clinic director Carol Everett exposed
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:29.080]  that the industry seeks to find a constant stream of new clientele by
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:34.480]  infiltrating public school systems and she also revealed how they specifically
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:40.320]  seek to target the fastest growing minority groups well I want you to think
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:43.360]  of this as a business people don't think of it as a business but they have to
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:47.760]  expand their market who is their market the woman who's having an abortion and
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:54.200]  so who is the longest-term customer for an abortion clinic it's a woman early in
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:57.600]  her teens who is going to continue using abortion as a method of birth control
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:02.760]  through after childbearing years so they go into the schools with our goal was
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:07.360]  three to five abortions between the ages of 13 and 18 but you cannot just go to
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:10.360]  these kids when they're 12 and say I want you to start getting pregnant so
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:14.960]  what we did was we worked to create our market by breaking down the natural
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:18.120]  modesty separating the children from their parents and their values and
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:24.440]  becoming a sex part in their lives my commission was $25 my goal was 40,000
[1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:28.080]  abortions a year so I could be a millionaire last month I was there we
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:36.000]  did 545 my income was 13,625 dollars were they specifically targeting
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.240]  minority groups here in the public schools to get them to become these
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:45.080]  repeat clients we just have to look at where their facilities are located right
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:50.560]  and until recently there was not a single abortion clinic located in a white
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:58.080]  middle class area they were all located in black areas in 1984 Planned Parenthood
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:03.360]  came to San Antonio Texas and hired a Hispanic marketing firm to learn how to
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:09.280]  market to the Hispanic population IE the fastest growing in the nation and the
[1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:15.080]  fastest growing in the abortion numbers and in the teen pregnancy numbers
[1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:25.040]  there you go that's that report from Leanne McAdoo of course Leanne and I and
[1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:29.000]  Joe Biggs you'll find us all on the nightly news we have a special going on

[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:30.120]  right now I've got a report from Rob do about oxy powder here's that report
[1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:35.840]  2015 is almost here and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:40.880]  transform your body the way you want it there's a reason over 88% of New Year's

[1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:07.640]  wars nightly news director Rob do has been using oxy powder with incredible
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:11.800]  success in your own words repeat to me what you said this morning and what
[1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:17.200]  oxy powder did for you I'll go into a little more detail back in September I
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:21.640]  started I decided I was going to take it and I was I've been hovering between
[1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:25.880]  220 and 215 couldn't get any lower than that you're a big guy what are you about
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:31.680]  63 63 yeah and you know in college I was about 185 190 and I was playing basketball
[1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:35.160]  and doing all that stuff so and I was really in shape over the years having
[1:43:35.160 --> 1:43:39.960]  kids you slow down a little bit so I was up to 220 I think the most I got to was
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:44.920]  230 at one point I started to develop you know like a double chin I hadn't really
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:47.800]  realized it I looked in the mirror I'm like oh my god so I've been trying to
[1:43:47.800 --> 1:43:51.760]  watch what I eat by taking different things and you know but I was still like
[1:43:51.760 --> 1:43:55.800]  at 215 and when we started selling oxy powder I'm like you know what I'm going
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:44:00.120]  to give it a try and I started off I did five pills the first night and nothing
[1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:03.880]  happened and they says on there you got to find your dose so the next night I
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:08.560]  did seven I woke up the next morning and basically you're gonna be visiting the
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:11.880]  bathroom what I think it does is it goes in there and like liquefies the stuff
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:15.560]  that's inside your intestines and then it just flows out pretty much not to get
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:19.000]  too graphic but I did that for six days once I found that stuff's rotting in
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.360]  there and that's what gives you cancer exactly that it's diverticula and it
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:25.520]  gets rid of it hurts your immune system it does all kind of stuff it just it
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:29.640]  keeps your digestive system from working properly all that stuff in there took it
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:32.640]  that first day and I took it for six more days after that and after that I
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:38.840]  was down to 202 and I know how fast did you lose 12 pounds it was in six seven
[1:44:38.840 --> 1:44:43.360]  days literally six seven days you had 12 pounds of filth gone went to the beach
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:47.760]  in early October and I look my wife is like wow you look really good and I'm
[1:44:47.760 --> 1:44:50.840]  like I know I don't I guess it's this oxy powder I've been trying to get her to
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:54.120]  take it she's like well I don't know I said no you're gonna take it so you did
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:57.960]  all this stuff and it got some of the weight down but not the rest away well
[1:44:57.960 --> 1:45:01.840]  I mean for me it's all a synergy but I wish I'd have taken it years ago when
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:05.240]  they were henpecking me to take it yeah I mean like really 12 pounds melted off
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:10.160]  it less in about a week I'd say a week seven days and I've been able to keep it
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:13.580]  off to I'm I'm I measure myself last night actually I'm like let's see what
[1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:17.720]  I'm at 202 how often do you take the ox powder no I haven't taken it since that
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:21.600]  one week time but I'm gonna take it probably after Thanksgiving I think
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:25.400]  that's so I think every three months I'm just gonna how many pills made you lose
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:31.640]  12 pounds it well so you did seven for six days and five and then five the first
[1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:37.440]  day so seven times five 35 plus five about 40 pills so it's not even not
[1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:41.240]  even a quarter of the bottle really how many pills are 120 yeah so literally
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:44.960]  like one bottle if you know I don't I don't take it every day I did it for
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:48.600]  that I did it intensely you and you really have to stick to it and by the
[1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:51.640]  third or fourth day you're like I don't know if I want to keep doing this if you
[1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:55.040]  just get through it it's not really it's not bad at all considering the weight I
[1:45:55.040 --> 1:45:59.800]  lost I mean I could never lose the weight doing any other way you know that
[1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:03.600]  quickly well this is the final thing people Hollywood stars do to lose that
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:06.460]  final amount of weight yeah if you're going to if you got a wedding or
[1:46:06.460 --> 1:46:09.760]  something coming up I'd say and groups in here in the office like months ago
[1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:14.200]  going look see this star she did it and look at this Alex just telling us best
[1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:19.360]  thing I got you need to sell it it definitely works and you know I'm
[1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:25.520]  also doing the x2 and little DNA force but I mean the main thing that I saw the
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:29.880]  biggest fastest improvement was oxy powder and I'm I'm totally amazed with
[1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:34.040]  it now after Thanksgiving I'm gonna do another round and the great part is we
[1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:37.280]  can go out research bring people the most cutting-edge products and then fund
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:41.160]  the operation with it it's a win-win-win and then all we gets rave reviews we

[1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:50.240]  that we can just bring people the very best stuff at very affordable prices
[1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:54.920]  fund our operation and then they love us and then they help us we help them and
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:59.400]  everybody's lovey-dove had a good price too you know you know what would you pay
[1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:02.880]  to lose 12 pounds in a week well how much would you pay for that that's what

[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:42.680]  alright now it's gonna be back tomorrow as I said he's going to have a new
[1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:46.240]  special that you've never seen before and Alex will be back tomorrow to explain
[1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:51.200]  what that is I want to take your calls at 800-259-9231 we've been talking
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:58.000]  about the whitewashed CIA torture report that came out of the Senate oversight
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.640]  committee and of course you're not going to see any oversight of the CIA not
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:07.440]  even a pretense of oversight once Richard Burr takes the place of Diane
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:11.160]  Feinstein because he said he doesn't think anything that they do should be
[1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:15.680]  told to the public they're going to be allowed to govern in complete secrecy and
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:20.520]  when I say govern that's exactly what I mean we have an organization just like
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:25.240]  the Federal Reserve where the head is appointed by the visible facade government
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:28.400]  that we see but they are allowed to do whatever they want to without any
[1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:33.440]  auditing in secret and there's never any accountability no matter what they do
[1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:38.360]  now before we go to your calls and just this last little bit here today and it
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:41.720]  may have already passed I don't know they've been working on the continuing
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:46.600]  resolution omnibus bill which is going to fund the government through next year
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:50.960]  through September of 2015 it's not just a continuing resolution because that
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:54.840]  would just be for a couple of months no this is a big omnibus bill this is a
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:58.720]  trillion dollars they want to avoid a shutdown so it has to be passed today but
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:03.200]  when did they give that to Congress when did they give that to the public well
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:07.720]  the GOP did the same thing Pelosi has been doing in the past the same thing
[1:49:07.720 --> 1:49:12.080]  they criticized Pelosi for the same thing they pledged they would not do in
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:17.240]  2010 and that is dump thousands of pages on the American public with all
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:21.160]  kinds of stuff buried in it with just a few hours to look to see what's in it
[1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:24.400]  Pelosi famously said we'll have to pass it to see what's in it when she was
[1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:28.480]  talking about Obamacare they've done this now two weeks in a row it was last
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:32.560]  week as I point out early in the show at 10 30 p.m. on a Tuesday they dumped the
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:38.080]  NDAA which funds the military and of course the military is a legitimate
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:41.480]  function of the federal government is about the only thing they do that is
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:44.680]  legitimate under the Constitution but not to the extent that they're doing it
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:48.080]  not to the extent that we have multiple foreign wars going on not to the extent
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:52.600]  that we are doing drone assassinations abroad and torture and on and on but
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:56.440]  it's a massive thing so it has to be funded because that's what our government
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:50:01.600]  has become all about a 500 a 500 billion dollar bill and buried in that were
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:08.000]  things like a 650,000 acre land grab part of that is going to be used for a
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:13.920]  copper company taking some land that used to be in the possession of Indians
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:17.840]  are going to now take that and they're going to turn that over to a copper
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:21.520]  company and of course John McCain is going to preside over that because that's
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:25.320]  his little fiefdom just like you have Harry Reid and Nevada he's going to
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:29.960]  preside over the taking of public lands for the use of giant multinational
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:33.640]  corporations well John McCain is doing the same thing in Arizona that's what
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:37.840]  this copper mine is about we're going to talk about the details that are buried
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:42.000]  some of the ones that have already surfaced in the bill this week so last
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  week it was a 500 billion dollar bill they had a couple hours to take a look
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:48.640]  at thousands of pages this week they do it again with a trillion dollar bill
[1:50:48.640 --> 1:50:52.320]  several thousand pages a couple hours take a look at it we're going to talk
[1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:55.320]  about some of the things that are buried in that you won't believe what
[1:50:55.320 --> 1:50:58.680]  they're going to do stay with us we'll be right back

[1:54:12.640 --> 1:54:15.520]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we're
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:18.880]  going to be going to your calls in just a little bit but I wanted to talk a
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:23.040]  little about what's being buried in this bill and of course Breitbart just came
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:26.400]  up with an article saying Boehner ally admits that the omnibus bill was
[1:54:26.400 --> 1:54:30.520]  crafted literally in a cigar smoke-filled back room we have a Joe Klein
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:33.720]  talking about how he's had the quote opportunity to talk about this
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:38.520]  particular pension problem over a cigar at the end of the day on more than one
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:44.520]  occasion with a Democrat so there we go now what is buried in some of this let's
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:48.760]  go over some of the really bad stuff he talked about the pension plan they're
[1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:54.760]  also going to bring in derivative insurance through the FDIC that's the
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:54:59.400]  federal deposit insurance corporation that's the the organization that
[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:04.640]  ensures your bank deposits and of course we were told after the pump and dump
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:10.120]  mortgage scam after the tarp bailout we were told that that wasn't going to
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:14.280]  happen again because we had Dodd Frank that was going to keep the banks from
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:20.120]  essentially socializing their losses while they privatized their profits now
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:26.320]  the GOP house has snuck it back in they're going to have new derivatives
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:30.440]  which are much much larger orders of magnitude larger than the mortgage
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:34.800]  derivatives that they've been concocting out their Wall Street has been doing
[1:55:34.800 --> 1:55:38.800]  this now they're going to have those derivatives insured by the FDIC of
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:43.640]  course they also got a lot of press because they overrode the DC referendum
[1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:47.720]  on marijuana legalization I guess Washington DC stands for direct
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:52.080]  control they're not going to respond to the overwhelming number of people who
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:56.240]  wanted to stop this war on drugs at least on marijuana I know that's not
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:01.040]  going to happen but even more importantly the GOP who was elected
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:04.920]  saying that they were going to oppose Obamacare they were going to defund it
[1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:07.600]  they were going to stop it they were going to do something about this
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:11.320]  illegal dick dictation I should I guess we should call it because it's not
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:15.120]  really an executive order he didn't even bother to sign it he didn't write it out
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:20.560]  he didn't file it he just decrees it like a royal majesty I guess he's now
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:24.240]  literally a dictator they were going to do something about Obama's executive
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:28.560]  dictate on amnesty no they're funding that they're also going to fund Obamacare
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:31.840]  the only thing they're taking out is ten million dollars for death panels I guess
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:38.360]  we should be grateful for that amount of movement they also gave themselves a
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:42.840]  lot of kind of a gift to themselves because you know Christmas is coming up
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:45.320]  and you know they're wondering why they're going to give their fellow member of
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:49.960]  Congress well they decided that the 32,000 dollar limits on the RNC and the
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:53.520]  DNC the Republican National Committees and Democrat National Committees they're
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:57:00.000]  going to raise those limits to 324,000 a factor of 10 because that's the way you
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.240]  get things done in Washington and of course you want to see we're I guess
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:09.080]  we'll go to our $2 billion election we got up to the $1 billion election
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:13.000]  pretty quickly now we're going to accelerate because when they increase
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.800]  the amount of money that can be given to the politicians who are running for
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:23.400]  office that's going to be a leverage for the people who are buying them because
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:27.640]  it's a great investment to buy a congressman you get a huge return on
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:31.480]  investment when you buy a congressman but although they're going to be funding
[1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:34.920]  their campaigns they're going to be allowing this is what he was talking
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:38.120]  about we talked about this pension plan thing a lot this is where they're
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:42.240]  really going to come after you and I think this speaks volumes about the
[1:57:42.240 --> 1:57:47.120]  decline of America they're going to allow pension plans to be changed for the
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:51.400]  first time understand that pension plans have always been sacrosanct you can't
[1:57:51.400 --> 1:57:55.200]  touch them in a bankruptcy you can't mess with them if you're a corporation
[1:57:55.200 --> 1:57:59.640]  but they're going to allow the contributions to pension plans that are
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:03.680]  required by these corporations they're going to allow them to change those
[1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:07.440]  terms they're going to give them legal coverage to do that so while they get
[1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:10.840]  their campaign contributions you can kind of forget about your pension
[1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:15.280]  contributions I think that really underscores the corruption of Congress
[1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:18.120]  and let me tell you this if you think they're going to do that with private
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:22.560]  pensions what do you think they're going to do with social security they're
[1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:25.520]  going to touch that as well but they're going to come after your private
[1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:28.200]  pensions they're going to give the green light to that for their corporate
[1:58:28.200 --> 1:58:32.520]  buddies we'll be right back with your calls stay with us

[2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:20.080]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:27.600]  Texas alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight your
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:30.640]  host today I'm gonna go to calls in just a moment there was one more article I
[2:00:30.640 --> 2:00:35.440]  wanted to go over and that is some fun info wars dot com from Curt Nemo new
[2:00:35.440 --> 2:00:39.760]  poll shows most Americans support Second Amendment and gun ownership that's
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:44.000]  right 52% the highest it's been in decades and this is not from a
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:48.560]  conservative research center this is from the Pew Research Center I think
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:53.080]  people are getting to understand this because they understand that the
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:57.760]  government is not there to protect them and they also know with our open
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:01.560]  borders what can happen anybody that's been paying attention and jacari had a
[2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:06.240]  great report on this the other night as it was last night I believe he had the
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:10.360]  interview with the reporter from Mexico and of course there's been tens of
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:14.280]  thousands of people killed in Mexico with war on drugs there a lot of
[2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:18.760]  corruption from the government a lot of murdering on both sides and the only
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:22.960]  place where people are safe are where the citizens have armed themselves to
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:26.520]  protect themselves against both the drug cartels and the corrupt government
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:30.520]  there one thing that illustrated that of course is the 49 college students who
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:34.800]  were killed after they heckled a politicians wife's speech they
[2:01:34.800 --> 2:01:39.800]  essentially used the drug cartels to go after these 49 kids murdered them and
[2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:46.280]  buried them that's happening all the time in Mexico and we've opened up our
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:51.280]  borders so the drug cartels can come right in to our country so get a gun
[2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:54.920]  learn how to use it that's what some of the honest sheriffs have been telling
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:01:59.600]  people about now earlier in the show we were talking about the torture report
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:03.640]  that came out from Diane Fine said I want to get your comments on that let's go
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:10.800]  to Stephen in Florida Stephen go ahead after good afternoon David I want to
[2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:15.960]  address this issue and from two different angles first of all you know
[2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:20.040]  it's been brought out how the NSA spying on us we're being tracked and
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:24.880]  monitored by all this government control grid and I know from predict in
[2:02:24.880 --> 2:02:29.560]  particular from listening to Alex that they are really monitoring you folks at
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:35.120]  Info Wars I want to put a word out to these people that want to advocate and
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:41.440]  promote this new order system that thinks it's okay to brutally torture and
[2:02:41.440 --> 2:02:48.120]  murder people there's a day coming you may get away with it in human the human
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:52.400]  realm there's a day coming when you're gonna stand before your creator Jesus
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:56.320]  Christ to give an account for this it's all being recorded you're under
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:03:00.520]  surveillance it's gonna come up at the Great White Throne and then you're
[2:03:00.520 --> 2:03:05.720]  going to be cast into the lake of fire where you will be tormented and that
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:11.360]  word means tortured forever and ever and ever and you can take that to the bank
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:16.680]  without your bankster mob bosses the other thing I want to say is this I am
[2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:20.840]  totally disgusted as a Bible-believing Christian how the majority of
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:26.600]  professing Christians in America are living in a fantasy world because of
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:31.600]  this pre-trib rapture theory and that's exactly what it is it's unbiblical and
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:38.680]  they do not want to believe that we here in America are somehow going to go
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:43.840]  through what everybody else in history as a believer in Jesus Christ has had to
[2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:49.360]  go through and that is persecution this is what we're facing and like you guys
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:52.520]  are pointing out it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy you know people
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:03:56.080]  say well you know we're living in the last days and the Lord said this was
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:03:59.800]  gonna happen and there's nothing we can do about it so Lord come and take us out
[2:03:59.800 --> 2:04:05.320]  of here before this all gets really bad you people better wake up because you
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:10.560]  are going to face the reality when people like what Joe Beeks used to do are
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:16.480]  gonna come busting in your door in the middle of the night in Germany and in
[2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:21.400]  Russia and drag your Sally Hyde off one of the FEMA camps and you will not
[2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:25.920]  escape that so you better wake up and get with the program now before you get a
[2:04:25.920 --> 2:04:29.520]  real rude awakening my friends and it's not just the it's not just the
[2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:33.280]  eschatology Stephen it's also the idea if you're a Christian where is your
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:37.240]  compassion for other people why don't you want to stop this from happening to
[2:04:37.240 --> 2:04:41.440]  other people doesn't it rip your heart out to see something like happen to
[2:04:41.440 --> 2:04:45.920]  Eric Garner I mean I just can't I can't understand how Christians can set aside
[2:04:45.920 --> 2:04:50.800]  and not do anything we'll be right back with the false
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:05.040]  as the year is coming to a close we all pause to reflect on what's happened in
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:10.080]  the past year we take a step back and thank God for what we have I'm David

[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:17.960]  their way because while the truncheon may be used
[2:08:17.960 --> 2:08:23.600]  loo of conversation words will always retain their power words over the
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:30.520]  means to meaning and for those who will listen the annunciation there is
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:34.840]  something terribly wrong with this country isn't that you decided sir you
[2:08:34.840 --> 2:08:38.280]  wanted it for proof you told me every television in longer cruelty and
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:42.360]  injustice intolerance and depression and where once you had the freedom to
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:47.200]  object and think and speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:51.800]  surveillance coercing your conformity and so getting your submachine cameras
[2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:56.600]  how did this happen who's to blame well certainly there are those who are more
[2:08:56.600 --> 2:09:01.480]  responsible than others they will be held accountable but again truth be told
[2:09:01.480 --> 2:09:07.480]  if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror I know why
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:14.480]  you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there
[2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:19.120]  were a myriad of problems to conspire to corrupt your reason and rob you of
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:24.000]  your common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn to the
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:28.880]  now-high chancellor Adam Sutler he promised you order he promised you
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:35.360]  peace and all he demanded in return was your silent to be to consent
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:46.080]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:54.040]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war
[2:09:54.680 --> 2:09:57.960]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today I'm going
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:04.200]  to be taking some calls the number to call is 800-259-9231 I want to get
[2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:09.680]  your responses to the torture report we just talked to Steven from Florida he
[2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:12.880]  was talking to the Christians and I think that's right because that's where
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:15.880]  the revival the country is going to come from it's going to come from a
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:21.320]  revival of the church we need to regain our moral compass it has to come from
[2:10:21.320 --> 2:10:25.240]  Christians if you can watch this stuff that's being done in our name to people
[2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:30.160]  on the streets to the by the police if you can watch people being tortured if
[2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:34.520]  you can read these reports as to what's being done and your responses we're just
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:39.880]  awesome I can't understand that I cannot understand that response especially if
[2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:43.800]  you're a Christian Martin Luther said if I knew the world was going to end
[2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:47.440]  tomorrow I would still plant a tree today would you help your fellow man
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:50.880]  today if you knew the world is going to end tomorrow you're going to be or you
[2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:55.000]  were going to be because you think that your eschatology is going to lift you
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:57.360]  out of all the troubles and you're going to go straight to heaven do you
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:00.880]  think that you should do something today to help your fellow man even if you're
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:04.680]  not going to have to suffer through it yourself do you have any compassion for
[2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:09.640]  your fellow man's suffering when you see homeless men shot to death on the street
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:13.800]  like a firing squad when you see people beaten to death homeless people beaten
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:18.760]  to death do you have any compassion over that I don't understand it I just don't
[2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:22.640]  understand the capacity the passiveness of the American public I just don't get
[2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:28.400]  it you know there's a day coming we're going to have our judgment at Nuremberg
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:32.640]  and if you're an old man if you're a Dick Cheney and you think you're going to
[2:11:32.640 --> 2:11:35.320]  escape that you don't believe in God you're going to stand before God you're
[2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:38.360]  going to answer before God and he's not going to be taking any of your lies
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:42.680]  Dick Cheney but there's a lot of people who think that they're not going to have
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:45.000]  to answer in this life you know what we're going to have our Nuremberg
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:49.720]  trials and the people at top who say it was for the national security that I'm
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:52.960]  going to wash and the people at the bottom who say they were just following
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:12:00.640]  orders that's not gonna wash either let's go to Jacob in Ohio Jacob Jacob you
[2:12:00.640 --> 2:12:06.360]  still there go ahead you want to talk about torture go ahead well I mean we
[2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:11.240]  act like we just found out about it but as Alex said yesterday you guys have been
[2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:15.280]  reporting on it for over 13 years am I right oh yeah yeah and they've been
[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:19.680]  talking about it I mean they were reporting and they were doing their legal
[2:12:19.680 --> 2:12:23.120]  covers for it they were destroying evidence everybody knew about it
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:26.800]  everybody knew that Bush the Bush administration was doing this and they
[2:12:26.800 --> 2:12:29.480]  were telling everybody that it was working they were telling people that we
[2:12:29.480 --> 2:12:32.760]  were getting good data now we're being told that we don't have good data but
[2:12:32.760 --> 2:12:38.760]  the key is is that in 20 different line items on this report
[2:12:38.760 --> 2:12:43.760]  Feinstein says well the CIA did this the CIA did that see it nobody of course but
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:47.760]  the CIA is guilty she's not doesn't have any responsibility according to her
[2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:52.160]  nobody in the Bush administration has a responsibility nobody in the Obama
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:55.440]  administration who's been trying to keep this report secret they've had this
[2:12:55.440 --> 2:12:58.120]  report for a long time they've been playing with it for six years they've
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:02.400]  run up tens of millions of dollars in salary for their staff to play with this
[2:13:02.400 --> 2:13:09.360]  report the only reason this report came out is because the CIA made Diane Feinstein
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:14.040]  and her staff angry because they spied on her see she's not supposed to be
[2:13:14.040 --> 2:13:18.880]  spied on she didn't care if they spy on us they just passed a law as Justin
[2:13:18.880 --> 2:13:22.160]  Amash talked about and we had talked about earlier in the show where they're
[2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:26.360]  going to under cover of law say that they can get everybody's information not
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:30.480]  go before a judge not get us a subpoena they've been doing that they're just
[2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:35.760]  trying to go back and put in some legal cover because they do know that there is
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:40.240]  a risk of a Nuremberg trial for these guys so they're trying to go back and
[2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:44.440]  put this cover in there it isn't going to wash because the Constitution says
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:48.240]  you need to go before a judge and be specific about what you're looking for
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:51.760]  but specific about where you're going to look for it you have to have a reason
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:55.040]  to get our data no laws that they push are going to pass constitutional
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:13:57.400]  mustard go ahead Jacob what you want to say this has been going on for a long
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:05.080]  time as you point out yeah I personally known about it and heard Alex talk about
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:09.400]  it I've been listening to his show for about 10 years now and he's definitely
[2:14:09.400 --> 2:14:16.720]  know oh yeah yeah it's nothing at all new it's nothing at all new they're just
[2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:20.720]  trying to give themselves some cover for this thank you so much Jacob let's go
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:24.400]  to skip in Nebraska skip you want to talk about the NDA and of course that was
[2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:30.080]  just re-upped again last last week so actually it was they brought the bill
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:35.360]  of same day that they they came out with this torture report go ahead skip
[2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:42.360]  imagine that yeah what a coincidence this is just don't happen you know that
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:47.200]  I've been listening to Alex for a long time and God bless you and him and all
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:53.480]  the staff for what you do but I wish I could talk to Alex but I'm going to
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:58.160]  ask you as a brother and a friend to kind of take him under a wing and say
[2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:05.400]  look I understand your outrage and I kind of and I don't mind you expressing
[2:15:05.400 --> 2:15:09.400]  your outrage but there's only one flaw with that if you scream and holler at
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:15.320]  us that the Homeland Security's got six billion rounds of ammunition that's fine
[2:15:15.320 --> 2:15:22.880]  but find out who is manufacturing that form where are the deliveries being sent
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:27.520]  where are the weapons being cashed you say there's FEMA camps let's get the
[2:15:27.520 --> 2:15:33.520]  locations of them so that at least you know if we know where they're hiding
[2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:38.440]  all this stuff we can avail themselves of it where are where are the MRAPS
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:41.880]  being stored and stashed well we know where the MRAPS being stored and
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:45.720]  stashed being stored at your local police department because they want you
[2:15:45.720 --> 2:15:50.120]  the people in each town the police department each town the taxpayers who
[2:15:50.120 --> 2:15:53.400]  support that they want them to pay for the upkeep and maintenance of it
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:57.840]  they're prepositioning that stuff and they want the local taxpayers to keep to
[2:15:57.840 --> 2:16:01.760]  do the upkeep they have tremendous maintenance costs for these vehicles
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:06.640]  because they were rushed into the battle at last minute without a lot of
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:09.080]  preparation they're poorly designed they don't last very well they have
[2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:13.040]  tremendous maintenance costs so they basically send these white elephants
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:18.480]  literally white elephants to the local police departments they have to maintain
[2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:21.480]  these things and keep them in working order because they still belong to the
[2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:24.360]  Department of Defense and the Department of Defense is going to swoop in and use
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:27.640]  them whenever they feel like it that's the whole point of that and of course the
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:31.280]  ammunition that you're talking about that's coming out for the for Homeland
[2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:37.440]  Security they're buying that ammunition that is coming out of the the general
[2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:40.600]  public fund that's why we had increases in ammunition costs why we had
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:45.040]  shortages of ammunition the military makes their own ammunition but of course
[2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:50.240]  Homeland Security is going into the marketplace and and buying that up so
[2:16:50.240 --> 2:16:53.680]  that's creating another issue and of course that's one of the things that's
[2:16:53.680 --> 2:16:59.400]  changed they understand as the author from Wolverton from the New American
[2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:03.480]  magazine John Burt society want to talk to him last week he said again of course
[2:17:03.480 --> 2:17:08.320]  without any ammunition is nothing but a club and they understand that that's why
[2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:11.640]  this administration has been moving against ammunition in a way that you've
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:15.400]  never seen that happen before it's always been well this gun looks a little
[2:17:15.400 --> 2:17:19.880]  bit scary so let's ban this gun let's ban that gun piecemeal infringement of the
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:23.120]  right to keep and bear arms but no if they go after the ammunition if they
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:27.960]  make that expensive or impossible to get that's when they really shut you down
[2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:32.360]  and of course that's why it's a key component of the UN arms trade treaty
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:37.320]  they're coming after not only just all private ownership of guns but also all
[2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:41.920]  ammunition all parts you can't move anything across the borders you can't
[2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:45.560]  and of course setting up a registry to spy on everybody that's where this all
[2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:49.760]  goes down is a registry to spy on people earlier in the day I talked about how
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:56.480]  Prime Minister Abe of Japan has put this new law in that is going to allow
[2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:00.880]  civil servants people who work for the government to go to be sent to prison for
[2:18:00.880 --> 2:18:05.240]  ten years if they leak state secrets well guess what everything is a state
[2:18:05.240 --> 2:18:10.200]  secret the mother of the 12 year old who had the BB gun who was shot said at the
[2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:16.440]  funeral you're not James Bond you don't have a license to kill that's true but
[2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:21.320]  they see themselves as James Bond they think they've got a license to kill and
[2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:26.000]  they think everything is a state secret let me tell you every time we go to talk
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:30.800]  to anybody it doesn't matter how low down they are at local government or
[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:35.760]  what everybody thinks they've got state secrets everybody acts like the CIA used
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:39.400]  to be the only one to act like they all act like that here's a comment from
[2:18:39.400 --> 2:18:42.200]  Japan though the reason I bring this back up I didn't talk about this when I
[2:18:42.200 --> 2:18:48.920]  first brought this up critics of Japan's state secret law say this marks a
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:56.600]  return to the days of Japanese militarism a return to militarism that is what is
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:01.800]  at the basis of all of this stuff as Joe Viggs was talking about it's training
[2:19:01.800 --> 2:19:06.840]  they're training us as well as the police as well as the military they're
[2:19:06.840 --> 2:19:12.480]  training us to not have any dignity so that we won't have any freedom it is
[2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:18.360]  about militarism and it is militarism that is coming home if you think America
[2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:22.920]  is just awesome like that Fox News commentator kept saying the other day
[2:19:22.920 --> 2:19:26.720]  that's all she could say ignore this torture report we're just awesome
[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:29.280]  everything about us is we got to play that when we come back from the break
[2:19:29.280 --> 2:19:34.200]  but it's just everything is awesome then you don't realize that this is
[2:19:34.200 --> 2:19:37.920]  training for America Joe Viggs and I have walked through one of the training
[2:19:37.920 --> 2:19:43.160]  facilities we've seen it you ought to be afraid of what is coming it's very
[2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:47.840]  clearly coming we've seen this movie before we know how it ends and let me
[2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:52.680]  tell you how it ends it ends with you guys going up before the people in a
[2:19:52.680 --> 2:19:56.480]  trial you who are pulling this off that's how it's going to end ultimately
[2:19:56.480 --> 2:19:59.680]  but a lot of innocent people are gonna die in the meantime we've got to get

[2:24:09.880 --> 2:24:15.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we're going to go back to your calls just wanted to go over this
[2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:21.960]  report again from the person who took Obama to task yet another heckler
[2:24:21.960 --> 2:24:26.720]  whenever he gets these hecklers that are pro illegal immigration and he gets
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:31.120]  flustered and that's when he says things like hey I changed the law for you well
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:35.800]  this particular guy came after him as an anchor from Fusion and said you're
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:39.600]  saying you always had the legal authority to stop deportations then why
[2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:44.160]  did you deport why did you deport two million people why didn't you stop it
[2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:48.240]  he says and then Obama goes back and forth with him gets kind of flustered
[2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:51.960]  of course Obama has said on more than 20 occasions that he didn't have the
[2:24:51.960 --> 2:24:56.040]  authority to do that when somebody else took issue with him he said hey I
[2:24:56.040 --> 2:24:58.800]  changed the law for you then he came back and said no I didn't really change the law
[2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:04.000]  but then he ends with this he says I just want you to work with me and make
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:08.240]  sure that immigrants know what their opportunities are and how they can take
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:12.000]  advantage of them you know opportunities like being able to get and
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:16.560]  state tuition even though they haven't been paying taxes like citizens they
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:18.960]  just come into this country and of course they can get in state tuition
[2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:22.680]  anywhere they want to go because they're illegal aliens they're above the law
[2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:25.800]  they're also going to be able to get Social Security and Medicare benefits and
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:31.120]  of course our Republicans that we just sent back didn't waste any time and be
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:35.000]  trained the voters who sent them back they were supposed to stop this they
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.920]  were supposed to stop Obamacare stop the funding do something to push that back
[2:25:39.920 --> 2:25:43.520]  but they didn't do anything they're funding Obamacare they're funding the
[2:25:43.520 --> 2:25:48.240]  amnesty and of course they're funding their campaign contributions raising that
[2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:52.700]  by a factor of 10 what the limits used to be to the Republican and Democrat
[2:25:52.700 --> 2:25:58.280]  National committees they raised it from 32,000 to 324,000 and there now another
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:02.960]  couple of guests for the big bankers that own them that they work for giving
[2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:08.960]  them FDIC protection for their derivatives casino game once again
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:13.920]  they're going to socialize the losses while these guys privatize the profits
[2:26:13.920 --> 2:26:19.080]  and then allowing big corporations to basically renege on their pension plans
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:23.160]  do you think we're going to get our Social Security if they're going to allow
[2:26:23.160 --> 2:26:28.240]  private pension plans to be reneged on of course we're not there's not going to
[2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:31.800]  be any money for Social Security 20 years ago there were more people believed
[2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:34.960]  and space aliens and believed they were going to get Social Security when they
[2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:39.460]  died and I'm sure that it's much worse than that now let's go back to your
[2:26:39.460 --> 2:26:47.320]  calls let's go to Kevin in West Virginia Kevin I have a question about
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:52.080]  Social Security and it also ties in with Obamacare death panels I'm one
[2:26:52.080 --> 2:26:57.360]  Social Security SSI because I'm blind and I only get $700 a month and I feel
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:01.840]  bad for even getting that because I know there's stuff out there that I can do
[2:27:01.840 --> 2:27:05.920]  and it also ties in with the death panels because as they're going to be a day
[2:27:05.920 --> 2:27:10.040]  when they come and say oh well you're not useful for the state we're just going
[2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:15.920]  to euthanize you now well precisely yeah once the government has once the
[2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:18.840]  government pays for your health care then of course they can come in and make
[2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:22.000]  demands as they're already doing we see Michelle doing about I think you're too
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:25.200]  you're getting too much sugar you're you're getting too much salt I don't
[2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:28.920]  think you're healthy enough so I'm going to ban this I'm going to ban that and
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:32.600]  if that doesn't work if you're somebody that they don't think is useful as you
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:35.920]  point out if you're blind or you've got some kind of physical infirmity or
[2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:41.480]  you're older it's just so I want green time because you're just a drag on their
[2:27:41.480 --> 2:27:47.960]  taxpayers scares me yeah yeah it's very it's very troubling that's one of the
[2:27:47.960 --> 2:27:53.120]  reasons why you know again it is eventually going to go down to death
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:27:58.680]  penalty death death panels and they're going to be able to decide who gets
[2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:01.840]  treatment and who doesn't under what terms you know we've had entitlement
[2:28:01.840 --> 2:28:05.720]  programs in the past so this is going to be an unentitlement program and that's
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:09.200]  one of the reasons why and certainly I wouldn't begrudge you I would not
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:13.160]  begrudge you any social security benefits that you get I think the the sad
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:17.920]  thing is again talking about the churches that individuals and that
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:22.560]  churches have essentially given up and in many cases some of them are activists
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:27.240]  for trying to expand the welfare state it needs to be done privately it needs to
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:31.000]  be done by Christians that's the way you get rid of the fraud that's the way you
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:35.360]  help people who really need it is on a one-to-one basis and if it's done by
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:39.840]  individuals I don't think you're going to see this kind of death panel approach
[2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:43.000]  where we say well we just don't want to anybody that fits into this pigeonhole
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:46.880]  we're not going to give them any health care whatsoever that's the real danger
[2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:51.800]  that's why we don't want to see government in control of this let's go to
[2:28:51.800 --> 2:28:57.000]  Eric in Pennsylvania Eric mr. Knight nice speaking with you today thank you

[2:29:06.280 --> 2:29:09.720]  month that it's not your fault you can't look at it that way absolutely now

[2:34:46.360 --> 2:34:52.280]  were going to talk about gun rights Eric go ahead okay this is for everybody
[2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:57.160]  out there everyone we know our rights we know the second amendment what it means
[2:34:57.160 --> 2:35:03.080]  we all been through we know it my my advice is this don't be afraid whatever
[2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:08.920]  they do don't get scared just keep practicing keep your weapons at different
[2:35:08.920 --> 2:35:14.080]  locations don't stash them in one place for forbid something would happen they
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:18.760]  would come and confiscate them try to make friends with many people like as
[2:35:18.760 --> 2:35:24.600]  you are and not be violent but just just prepare for the for the worst I mean we
[2:35:24.600 --> 2:35:28.480]  know it's gonna what's gonna happen we know the end game here we just got to
[2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:34.920]  practice and I'll tell you what if it happens at your home I mean we can't one
[2:35:34.920 --> 2:35:38.840]  person can't take on a whole let's be a SWAT team but you're the king of your
[2:35:38.840 --> 2:35:43.640]  castle and you know your home better than anyone else so that's true yeah
[2:35:43.640 --> 2:35:46.480]  there's many many ways that we need to fight this I think one of the things
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:50.520]  that we need to understand is the danger of these no-knock raids that we've
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:55.240]  allowed happen in the name of the war on drugs and I think we've seen people from
[2:35:55.240 --> 2:35:58.360]  the left understand the danger of the war on drugs we see people on the right
[2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:03.160]  understand the danger of coming after the guns with second amendment I think if
[2:36:03.160 --> 2:36:08.240]  we can bring those two sides together we will really have an effective powerful
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:13.360]  coalition understand that we can shut this militarized police state down and I
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:19.080]  think one of the keys is also people getting involved taking the mystery out
[2:36:19.080 --> 2:36:23.240]  of guns letting them get trained you know owning your weapons and training with
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:26.680]  them that takes the mystery out of it you know once they start driving us
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:30.160]  around in computer driven cars that we don't have any steering wheels or
[2:36:30.160 --> 2:36:33.960]  brakes for everybody's gonna think cars are really scary and oh we could never
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:40.040]  drive a car it's just a machine and your gun is just a machine and just as the
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:45.080]  sheriff David Clark we've had on many times was telling his people in his
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:49.360]  town saying you need to get a gun you need to learn how to use it safely
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:53.600]  because I can't be there when there's an emergency we'll get there as soon as we
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:56.520]  can we'll try to catch the bad guys but there's going to be a certain amount of
[2:36:56.520 --> 2:37:01.680]  time before we can get there that's the truth of it protecting yourself from the
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:06.840]  bad guys that's why the number of people who support gun ownership has gone up
[2:37:06.840 --> 2:37:11.240]  to all-time highs and that's that that message has gone out we need to get that
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:14.760]  message out to more people in one of the ways we do it is to take the mystery the
[2:37:14.760 --> 2:37:19.120]  fears the lies and the disinformation surrounding guns and the second
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:22.440]  amendment appears Morgan has gone now but there's plenty of people to take his
[2:37:22.440 --> 2:37:25.320]  place we need to take that away as part of that a large part of that is the
[2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:28.640]  information war thank you Eric in Pennsylvania let's go to Paul and
[2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:31.360]  Canada Paul
[2:37:32.640 --> 2:37:38.080]  hello hello Paul you're online hi how are you doing doing good I'm here to talk
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:43.160]  about that the triangles that are that are around us right now now the reason
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:48.440]  why I use this analogy is because the Illuminati is everywhere the triangles
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:54.800]  the triangles are everywhere help help I think well yeah what's going on there
[2:37:54.800 --> 2:38:01.840]  let's go to Jake in Ohio Jake go ahead I'm sorry Oklahoma Jake in Oklahoma hey
[2:38:01.840 --> 2:38:06.920]  David how you doing today doing good man I wanted to call up today's my birthday
[2:38:06.920 --> 2:38:12.840]  for one but I just recently got turned on to info wars and everything and it's
[2:38:12.840 --> 2:38:16.600]  kind of just they're literally blowing my mind and I'm trying to tell as many
[2:38:16.600 --> 2:38:20.640]  people as I can without sounding like a like I've went off the deep end you know
[2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:24.440]  I'm sitting here trying to explain all this stuff and you know I'm trying to
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:28.400]  become more informed and everything I have a young family I got a baby on the
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:34.800]  way and Oklahoma's a little more you know not as liberal as when it comes to gun
[2:38:34.800 --> 2:38:38.400]  laws and well let me tell you Jake one the best ways you can do that I think and
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:42.440]  that's with documentaries and Alex has got a lot of documentaries you can see
[2:38:42.440 --> 2:38:46.800]  all of them if you're prison planet TV subscriber you can you can have access
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:51.160]  to all of Alex's documentaries of course you know there's Christmas special on
[2:38:51.160 --> 2:38:54.000]  that right now you get seven months for free with an annual thing but you can
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:58.440]  also find them online to some degree and that's the best way to wake people up
[2:38:58.440 --> 2:39:01.680]  you know getting the news every day getting bits and pieces of it they
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:05.040]  don't get the bigger picture like they do with the documentary and on these
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:08.520]  documentaries Alex has talked about the police state he's talked about the Obama
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:12.480]  deception he's talked about the fact that Obama was never going to punish
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:17.600]  Bush for any of these war crimes they were not he wasn't going to stop the
[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:21.360]  wars he's going to increase the wars he predicted all this stuff and when they
[2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:27.840]  see this documentary that's years old and he's got all the information there
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:32.480]  the sources the backup material the quotes that is a very effective thing
[2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:38.580]  what woke you up Jake I'm really just kind of like you know I listen to your
[2:39:38.580 --> 2:39:43.640]  Russian balls and all those guys before and they are good they're effective but
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:49.040]  it kind of felt like Alex went into a different realm like it wasn't just
[2:39:49.040 --> 2:39:52.800]  telling you this these are my opinion on things like I have credible resources I
[2:39:52.800 --> 2:39:57.920]  have I have informants people who are private informants and openly that's the
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:01.920]  thing that's really kind of open my eyes and actually a question for you just
[2:40:01.920 --> 2:40:06.800]  kind of me having a young family just learning a lot of these truths what is
[2:40:06.800 --> 2:40:11.800]  the best way right what's my best approach like how to kind of prepare for
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:17.160]  just anything that what you know all he's talking about if it actually if all
[2:40:17.160 --> 2:40:21.960]  this really transpires if it goes into well I think she's been all this yeah
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:26.080]  how do you prepare how do you prepare for worst-case scenario if it hits the
[2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:29.840]  fan why I think you prepare the same way you should prepare for a natural
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:34.000]  disaster for example you don't ever know you're in Oklahoma I mean you got
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:38.320]  tornadoes that go through there all the time you want to make sure that you have
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:42.760]  some preparation in case the grid goes down you want to have some place where
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:46.600]  you can take shelter same thing would happen if there's some kind of a terrorist
[2:40:46.600 --> 2:40:49.680]  attack or a false flag attack with a nuclear weapon you want to make sure
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:54.520]  that you have a food supply that you are somewhat independent you know we we
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:59.120]  think about our society everything is on the grid we're all interdependent
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:03.160]  there's not much on the grocery store shelves it's going to be there after a
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:06.720]  day or so it's all going to happen very quickly so that's why you need to
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:10.720]  prepare in advance to take care of your family and I think that it's the same
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:13.720]  sort thing you would do for a natural disaster except just thinking a little
[2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:18.320]  bit longer term not thinking about a couple of days but much longer term than
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:23.440]  that just prepare for things learn some basic skills learn how to survive without
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:27.400]  having to be dependent on things I would say that would be your your best
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:30.560]  approach and the way to wake people up I think is to give them documentaries
[2:41:30.560 --> 2:41:36.200]  thanks for calling let's move on to Patricia in Arizona Patricia go ahead
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:43.000]  hi I know you want to talk about torture and I think it's awful but
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:46.800]  everybody keeps bringing up guns and I really did have a point just about guns
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:53.000]  okay and that is there is there's a site on the internet that you can call to do
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:58.040]  background checks and I occasionally get on there if I'm looking for somebody
[2:41:58.040 --> 2:42:01.640]  haven't seen a long time or whatever and the other day when I got on there they
[2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:06.480]  had a new thing that they give you and they give you information as to whether
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:12.800]  or not you have ever registered for a gun and I thought oh my gosh if they're
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:17.080]  giving this out to the public then of course the police have got a list of
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:23.520]  everybody who is ever registered again because if they can do this online you
[2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:27.720]  know if somebody can just do this online randomly of course the police are
[2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:33.240]  gonna have it everything is everything is being recorded everything has been
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:39.200]  logged and noted you know I remember the story about when the Nazis moved
[2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:42.600]  into I think it was in Holland they had been keeping three by five card
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:47.000]  information on all the people in town just you know just they thought it was
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:51.760]  innocuous information yet when the Nazis came in they tried to destroy that but
[2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:54.920]  the cards are packed so tightly they couldn't get them to burn and the Nazis
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:42:59.200]  got a lot of that information and they used it to profile who they wanted to
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:03.680]  pick up who they wanted to prosecute that's the real issue and that's what
[2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:07.520]  William Benny has said if you want total tyranny if you want to
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:11.720]  Toletarianism it begins with total information about everybody he's
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:16.520]  observed this over his entire life he watched East Germany he watched the
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:22.320]  Soviet Union he knows how tyrannies work he knows how to Toletarian societies
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:26.480]  are structured and he said for a while he said we're going to go into police
[2:43:26.480 --> 2:43:31.160]  today I think there's a quote up on Info Wars today about that saying that
[2:43:31.160 --> 2:43:35.160]  we're getting really near to a police state he said that a long time ago when
[2:43:35.160 --> 2:43:39.960]  I talked to him months ago he said we have a police state we're not close to a
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:44.240]  police state we already have a police state what were your comments about
[2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:50.760]  torture that you want to say Patricia well I I remember when it keeps calling
[2:43:50.760 --> 2:43:54.720]  about them I'm so afraid of medical tyranny you know because of all the
[2:43:54.720 --> 2:44:01.000]  things they're how they're preying on that then the invalids and you know
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:06.240]  people who are handicapped and yes children children how children have
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:11.360]  just become I saw a woman carrying her baby at the store and it was cool here
[2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:16.680]  very cold and she had on boots and that final coat and all kinds of things and
[2:44:16.680 --> 2:44:22.520]  she put her baby in in a little snuggly on her chest and this baby had no
[2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:27.400]  covering on its legs with no shoes on no sweater no nothing in it it's as if
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:34.560]  they feel like oh they they can't feel it if they believe they are but anyways I
[2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:41.960]  also want a lack of empathy isn't it yes that the people need to everybody's
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:47.640]  talking about what can we do but you've got to talk to your neighbors even if
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:52.080]  you are I didn't talk to my neighbors for over a year because I thought they
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:57.480]  will put me in an insane asylum you know if I start telling this stuff and I
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:45:01.920]  finally just broke down went around to all the people around me and said look
[2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:06.680]  you've got to put water away you've got to put food away you've got to prepare it
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:11.080]  in case there would ever be an emergency and they thought I was crazy and I
[2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:15.480]  didn't tell them everything because they couldn't have handled it but I let them
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:23.160]  know that you've got to prepare a little bit here and then months later my
[2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:27.880]  neighbor directed by me said what are we going to do because I told them all when
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:31.760]  I got through giving them my little speech I said don't believe anything I'm
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:37.400]  saying get on the internet and what is that for yourself this is real this is
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:45.480]  really happening and then it was like but if they if they don't know I had one
[2:45:45.480 --> 2:45:49.240]  neighbor tell me well you know what Patty maybe you're just gonna have to be
[2:45:49.240 --> 2:45:54.560]  the one to take care of everybody we know and I said no there's a there's a
[2:45:54.560 --> 2:45:58.440]  real passivity and they have tried to breed that in people they keep us in
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:01.960]  school for a very long time they keep us for 12 years in school longer if you go
[2:46:01.960 --> 2:46:05.480]  to college they want you to be totally passive to believe that you are
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:09.720]  protected that the government is there to protect you we know that's not true we
[2:46:09.720 --> 2:46:13.120]  know that's not even true in natural disasters we look at what happens in
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:17.920]  many natural disasters now after FEMA has interposed itself they become the
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:22.400]  bottleneck of resources and everything has to flow through them whenever they
[2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:26.360]  get involved and that in and of itself is a tremendous problem during natural
[2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:28.800]  resources but again as a point out I think one of the best ways that you can
[2:46:28.800 --> 2:46:32.640]  wake people up let them look at the internet let them look at Alex Jones's
[2:46:32.640 --> 2:46:36.800]  documentaries because I think the documentaries take the time to lay it
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:41.160]  out in a way that people today will ingest it you know they're not going to
[2:46:41.160 --> 2:46:44.240]  look at a pamphlet a lot of people are not going to do an internet search to
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:47.360]  see if it's true but if they've got a movie to watch they'll watch that and we
[2:46:47.360 --> 2:46:50.760]  can make that case we can show the documentation there we can do it in
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:54.600]  an entertaining way thank you Patricia let's let's go to Chris in South
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:47:05.160]  Carolina Chris hello Chris yes sir I was the guy that called on on the day of
[2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:08.840]  when you guys had the thing with Ferguson I was explaining how we were
[2:47:08.840 --> 2:47:14.600]  already kind of in the med with American Union and how the fact that they were
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:20.640]  using this as a test for martial law oh yeah okay but at the same time all this
[2:47:20.640 --> 2:47:25.080]  stuff is going on you know you got Russia flying over our airspace and things
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:30.880]  of this nature what I feel like people have forgotten is okay you know Alex
[2:47:30.880 --> 2:47:34.880]  has had a couple people on this is just my perception of these things you know
[2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:41.760]  they were talking about the guy that in 20 the guy that released the thing for a
[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:48.920]  bombing in 2015 and I feel like okay there's these missing nukes got another
[2:47:48.920 --> 2:47:53.800]  guy on it was talking about how they can reach jacket bombs and now you got
[2:47:53.800 --> 2:47:58.640]  Russia and then you got him also dropping the prices trying to provoke
[2:47:58.640 --> 2:48:02.960]  Russia oh yeah we need the Cold War yeah they that's going to work out to their
[2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:07.320]  advantage of course because that allows them to sell more weapons in the
[2:48:07.320 --> 2:48:11.160]  military industrial complex and of course the biggest the biggest market the
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:16.080]  biggest way that they can make money is by militarizing the police that's a huge
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:19.920]  market terrorism is even a bigger market for them than the Cold War ever used to
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:23.280]  be but of course they want both they can never have enough go ahead you had
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:28.280]  another comment yeah what that well that's exactly what I'm saying and then
[2:48:28.280 --> 2:48:33.800]  the reasoning that they don't care so much about these executive orders as you
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:39.400]  see it's almost like they already know something that we don't know if I make
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:44.360]  sense the reason that the GOP doesn't care about the executive orders yeah
[2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:48.920]  they're not really caring I mean well I think it's I think they do I think they
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:53.440]  do care I think they want that power once they get back in office they don't
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:56.560]  want to shut him down they don't want to shut down the IRS because they want to
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:48:59.320]  use the IRS against their political enemies they don't want to shut down the
[2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:04.120]  CIA because they want to use the CIA as part of their police state they simply
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:07.760]  want control and so what you'll see whether it's Benghazi or whether it's
[2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:13.760]  the IRS scandals or whether it's the CIA they will use this to criticize the
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:18.720]  other side to make political points but they will never send anybody to jail
[2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:25.080]  they will never fire anybody they want that apparatus in there they just want
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:28.920]  to take control of the apparatus they want the lovers of control they don't
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:33.880]  want to dismantle any of this tyranny they just want to use these trials if
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:36.720]  you want to call them that or these congressional hearings to criticize the
[2:49:36.720 --> 2:49:40.160]  other side and then they're going to go in and take the lovers of power
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:43.680]  themselves and we see what's happening with the GOP doing exactly the same
[2:49:43.680 --> 2:49:47.960]  thing that they criticize Pelosi for doing and that is putting together this
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:52.400]  gigantic bill introducing it with just hours for the public and for other
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:55.240]  congressmen to take a look at it and say you got to pass it by Thursday or
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:49:58.520]  out of money for the government nothing will work the military will shut down
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:01.840]  everything will shut down so you got a couple hours to take a look at this and
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:06.760]  then they pack the kitchen sink in there welfare benefits for the insurance
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:11.920]  benefits I should say for big banks and taking down pension plans increasing
[2:50:11.920 --> 2:50:15.640]  their campaign contributions I mean everything is in there that doesn't
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:18.040]  have anything to do with continuing the funding of the government did you want
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:24.040]  to make another comment before we move on just the fact that I feel that that's
[2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:27.120]  going to be the pretenses because that's the only country they can't
[2:50:27.120 --> 2:50:31.240]  take down and that's who they're going to blame these these bombs on that's why
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:35.440]  the missing nukes nothing ever really happened about it and that's really where
[2:50:35.440 --> 2:50:39.160]  we're gonna end up that's why I feel like these executive orders are being
[2:50:39.160 --> 2:50:43.360]  passed and we'll see what happens it is a global problem as I've been talking
[2:50:43.360 --> 2:50:47.200]  about this situation in Japan saying they're going to send government workers
[2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:49.960]  to jail for 10 years if they're whistleblowers journalists to jail for
[2:50:49.960 --> 2:50:53.200]  five years you know what they say they say this is necessary to tight control

[2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:28.480]  anything wrong that's the dangerous kind of attitude that's going to be coming
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:33.840]  from the Republicans in this next Congress we've seen the Democrats tell
[2:54:33.840 --> 2:54:38.960]  their base in many cases that they didn't want to have unlimited warfare
[2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:41.960]  torture violations of civil liberties and yet they've done it anyway they've
[2:54:41.960 --> 2:54:45.680]  stepped it up from where Bush was what are we going to see when people like
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:48.640]  Richard Burr take over the Senate Intelligence Committee well we're not
[2:54:48.640 --> 2:54:53.200]  going to see anything I can see data from him we're not going to see any
[2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:57.960]  criticism whatsoever it's going to get much worse and we've been taking your
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:55:01.560]  calls about the torture report of course Alex Jones is going to be back tomorrow
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:04.760]  I'm sure he's going to have a lot to say about that and also about all the
[2:55:04.760 --> 2:55:10.520]  bodies that were buried inside of the congressional funding bill all kinds of
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:13.640]  stuff that they stuck in there at the last minute not giving anybody a chance
[2:55:13.640 --> 2:55:18.040]  to take a look at it that's what the GOP's promise amounts to it didn't even
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:22.600]  last a couple of weeks of course they passed the Keystone pipeline legislation
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:28.240]  for the ninth time but they didn't do anything to restrain the unconstitutional
[2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:32.360]  use of power and as we mentioned earlier we just had another bill passed that
[2:55:32.360 --> 2:55:36.640]  Justin Amash says is the most egregious legislation he's ever encountered it
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:41.040]  presumes to grant unlimited access to communications of every American without
[2:55:41.040 --> 2:55:44.680]  any kind of due process going poor judge getting a search warrant getting a
[2:55:44.680 --> 2:55:48.640]  subpoena nothing they're just going to give themselves legal authority to do
[2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:54.760]  what they've been illegally doing for quite some time and we've seen surfacing
[2:55:54.760 --> 2:56:00.280]  a document surfacing talking about this stingray program we've seen police go
[2:56:00.280 --> 2:56:05.880]  before judges saying they're not going to reveal anything about their source of
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:09.160]  where they got this because they have a non-disclosure agreement with Harris
[2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:13.480]  Corporation say that's the corporations of military industrial complex now are
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:18.280]  more important than our courts than our due process and when the judge says you
[2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:20.920]  don't have a non-disclosure agreement with me they just basically dropped the
[2:56:20.920 --> 2:56:24.040]  case and said we'll let the guy walk even though we think he's a criminal
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:29.120]  because the most important thing is our agreement with the military industrial
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:33.160]  complex we can't betray our corporations let's go back to your calls we have a
[2:56:33.160 --> 2:56:35.440]  little bit of time after want to try to get through as many people as we can let's

[2:56:42.040 --> 2:56:48.080]  mr. Nate doing good that's good I'm just like to express my embarrassment to the
[2:56:48.080 --> 2:56:53.200]  people of the United States and to the great staff that worked at Info Wars for
[2:56:53.200 --> 2:57:00.280]  that last idiot that called from this country okay okay what with the guy with
[2:57:00.280 --> 2:57:06.440]  the triangles right oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah a little crank call go ahead
[2:57:06.440 --> 2:57:11.040]  what'd you want to talk about well it's not that I'm trying to steal your thunder
[2:57:11.040 --> 2:57:16.800]  or anything like that but there's regarding the IPCC with the whole global
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:20.480]  warming thing mm-hmm I know that's kind of off topic for today but it was just
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:24.160]  something I came across the other day and there's a fellow who operates out of
[2:57:24.160 --> 2:57:30.520]  Japan his name is Corbett I think that the site is Corbett dot Tom and he's got
[2:57:30.520 --> 2:57:38.520]  the IPCC exposed for you know basically the lies and misinformation that it all
[2:57:38.520 --> 2:57:44.080]  is and maybe some of your viewers might want to take a look at this type of stuff
[2:57:44.080 --> 2:57:48.800]  as well yeah and actually it does kind of impinge on our tyrannical government
[2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:51.840]  Obama said right after the election even though the Republicans are gonna have a
[2:57:51.840 --> 2:57:56.400]  majority in both houses he said I'm gonna pass through my environmentalist
[2:57:56.400 --> 2:57:59.680]  agenda and there's nothing that they can or will do to stop it and of course we
[2:57:59.680 --> 2:58:05.600]  know there isn't because he's going to enact his his agenda whether anybody
[2:58:05.600 --> 2:58:09.000]  whether he's got any legal authority to do it whatsoever we've seen him do that
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:13.520]  over and over again let's go to George in North Carolina George we're out of
