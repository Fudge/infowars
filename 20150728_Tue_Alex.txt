[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.820]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.820 --> 00:29.880]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today on this live
[00:29.880 --> 00:37.120]  edition july 28th 2015 tuesday we're gonna be talking to alex jones later
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.560]  in the show he is of course in europe investigating globalist takeover there
[00:40.560 --> 00:44.680]  he's in london rob do has arrived there they're going to be joining us live later
[00:44.680 --> 00:50.120]  in the show as will paul joes of watson and we have a guest in studio abbey
[00:50.120 --> 00:55.400]  johnson she was a planned parenthood employee of the year back in 2009 and
[00:55.400 --> 01:01.220]  then she saw something that made her quit and become a whistleblower what she
[01:01.220 --> 01:08.260]  saw was an ultrasound of a baby recoiling in pain from the procedure that
[01:08.260 --> 01:14.600]  they told her the baby did not feel it's just a fetus right look you can call
[01:14.600 --> 01:20.000]  the fetus you can call it tissues but it's baby parts this is not a gray area
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  this is a black market we have another video today that has come out from the
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.400]  same whistleblowers that have been going around doing these sting operations
[01:30.400 --> 01:37.320]  they're not a hoax this is a sting operation the planned parenthood people
[01:37.320 --> 01:40.400]  the liberal media have been pushing back say this is a hoax this is a set up look
[01:40.400 --> 01:46.400]  if you catch somebody on camera dialoguing like a super villain because
[01:46.400 --> 01:51.400]  they're engaging in criminal activity and they don't know that you're recording
[01:51.400 --> 01:56.000]  them that's a sting operation 60 minutes used to do that when they did real
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.200]  journalism they do that all the time the law enforcement law enforcement does
[01:59.200 --> 02:03.960]  it all the time they're constantly doing that because people don't confess on
[02:03.960 --> 02:08.520]  camera to crime unless they don't know they're being recorded and of course how
[02:08.520 --> 02:15.640]  does the GOP leadership react to this? Boehner says he needs more facts well
[02:15.640 --> 02:19.200]  we've got more facts today we're gonna give him more facts maybe you should
[02:19.200 --> 02:24.480]  start sending him some facts I was just amazed to see the Hill put out a video
[02:24.480 --> 02:30.120]  of an article talking about how Boehner cried when he did a golf channel
[02:30.120 --> 02:34.680]  interview he can get so sentimental about golf but he doesn't give a rip
[02:34.680 --> 02:40.680]  about the children who are being torn apart and sold for profit that's the
[02:40.680 --> 02:45.480]  kind of leadership we have in this party those are the people that you voted for
[02:45.480 --> 02:50.920]  it just it just shows how broken this whole political system is we're also
[02:50.920 --> 02:54.880]  going to look at politics we have a segment today something I've been wanting
[02:54.880 --> 02:59.160]  to cover since Sunday is something we talked about on the nightly news last
[02:59.160 --> 03:07.480]  week when the story first broke I think it was Friday we saw this plan actually
[03:07.480 --> 03:12.160]  it was a study done by the Department of Defense about what the future battlefield
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.760]  would look like in 2050 I've thought about it all weekend it's bothered me so
[03:16.760 --> 03:20.440]  much I want to talk about on Sunday and I want to talk about it yesterday but
[03:20.440 --> 03:24.360]  there's been so much news so we didn't have enough time to talk about there's
[03:24.360 --> 03:28.880]  been a lot of news lately especially over this weekend we've had top scientists
[03:28.880 --> 03:32.880]  very well-known scientists this is not a conspiracy theory folks we've been
[03:32.880 --> 03:36.920]  talking about this for years it was dismissed as a bunch of tin foil hat
[03:36.920 --> 03:43.680]  conspiracy theory we'd seen too many Terminator movies look Elon Musk is
[03:43.680 --> 03:48.120]  funding millions of dollars because he's concerned about artificial
[03:48.120 --> 03:52.560]  intelligence being a runaway technology we've got killer robot conferences
[03:52.560 --> 03:59.360]  popping up all over Europe and of course people are maybe starting to get
[03:59.360 --> 04:03.920]  concerned about what could happen with genetically altered humans and of course
[04:03.920 --> 04:08.400]  there's always the concern that these genetic modifications might get out of
[04:08.400 --> 04:14.720]  control and cause mass death in terms of bio weapons because it's our own CDC
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.240]  the Center for Disease Control is actually the Center for Disease
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.600]  Propagation these people many of them you'll see them wearing military
[04:22.600 --> 04:28.560]  uniforms these people who work for the CDC they are bringing in deadly bacteria
[04:28.560 --> 04:34.160]  they're weaponizing the deadly bacteria they call them select agents who are
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.280]  they selecting these agents for when you combine that with genetics is a very
[04:38.280 --> 04:43.080]  troubling scenario and of course they enhance them with gain of function to
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.680]  make them more deadly easier to transmit so we're going to look at how these
[04:46.680 --> 04:53.320]  trends are converging into the future battlefield killer robots and genetically
[04:53.320 --> 04:58.400]  engineered superhumans stay with us it's an exciting show today

[08:20.640 --> 08:37.880]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this July 28 2015 Tuesday a live edition
[08:37.880 --> 08:41.760]  I'm David Knight your host here in Austin we're gonna be joined later in the
[08:41.760 --> 08:46.400]  show by Alex Jones he is in Europe he is looking at the globalist takeover there
[08:46.400 --> 08:50.480]  right now they are in London he's gonna be calling in so is Paul Joseph Watson
[08:50.480 --> 08:54.680]  later in the show and today of course we've had yet another planned parenthood
[08:54.680 --> 09:00.000]  video undercover video sting video as I said in the last segment it is not a
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.680]  hoax as the liberal media is trying to cover for this it is a sting you
[09:05.680 --> 09:10.280]  understand the difference right when somebody is engaged in criminal activity
[09:10.280 --> 09:13.400]  when they're monologuing like a supervillain because they don't know
[09:13.400 --> 09:17.640]  they're on video that is a sting it used to be done all the time by real
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.680]  journalists it's now being done by these real journalists who are getting it
[09:21.680 --> 09:25.680]  it used to it's done all the time by law enforcement that's the way they capture
[09:25.680 --> 09:29.360]  so many people because you just don't confess when you know the camera is on
[09:29.360 --> 09:35.280]  this is an amazing video that came out today again these videos this one is
[09:35.280 --> 09:41.320]  very very disturbing because in this particular one you can see them picking
[09:41.320 --> 09:47.720]  through the baby parts there are stills our videos it is very disturbing if you
[09:47.720 --> 09:53.760]  watch this if you have a conscience if it hasn't been seared it will bring tears
[09:53.760 --> 10:02.920]  to your eyes but of course Boehner can't cry about anything except golf he gets
[10:02.920 --> 10:06.760]  on the golf channel he gets moved to tears but when it comes to these videos
[10:06.760 --> 10:10.960]  he says he needs more facts before he can do something that's just absolutely
[10:10.960 --> 10:18.560]  amazing we're gonna have Abbey Johnson I'm sorry
[10:19.560 --> 10:24.040]  we're gonna have Abbey Johnson and then we're gonna talk to her she's a former
[10:24.040 --> 10:30.920]  Planned Parenthood employee she became muscleblower she was disturbed by what
[10:30.920 --> 10:35.360]  she saw we're gonna talk to her we're going to try to get through this video
[10:35.360 --> 10:41.560]  it's just I saw this morning I'm sorry and we're gonna talk about some
[10:41.560 --> 10:47.920]  politics here in a minute I just saw this story at the top of the news stack
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.720]  Central Florida theaters are issuing an alert on safety measures telling people
[10:53.720 --> 11:01.000]  to report suspicious characters we are becoming a very very paranoid society
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.920]  of course they're not going to give people the ability to carry concealed
[11:05.920 --> 11:09.720]  they're gonna make continue to make them gun-free zone so yes there is an
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.600]  element of risk there but I'm just reminding the last couple of days I've
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.960]  been going around with my son trying to get salt Peter potassium nitrate because
[11:20.960 --> 11:25.720]  we're trying to use it as fertilizer for some spirulina that we're trying to
[11:25.720 --> 11:29.600]  grow and of course when we walk in and we've gone to store after store because
[11:29.600 --> 11:32.920]  nobody carries this anymore I don't know if it's become a some of the people we
[11:32.920 --> 11:37.000]  went to a drugstore small drugstore not a big chain and they told us well we used
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.520]  to carry it but we had to stop carrying in a while back I don't know if it was
[11:40.520 --> 11:46.280]  made illegal I think they made it illegal and in in Canada but they all
[11:46.280 --> 11:51.920]  say to us what are you doing building a bomb and after hearing that about five
[11:51.920 --> 11:56.880]  or six times I just wanted to tell them you know if you really believe that that
[11:56.880 --> 12:02.080]  was a fertilizer bomb if you believe a fertilizer bomb could have taken down the
[12:02.080 --> 12:06.320]  Oklahoma City federal building like that by itself from that kind of an
[12:06.320 --> 12:12.120]  explosion maybe you should look at the blast pattern because it's not a point
[12:12.120 --> 12:15.880]  source it went across the entire front of the building I remember when that
[12:15.880 --> 12:21.040]  happened the Internet of course wasn't around I looked in the New American
[12:21.040 --> 12:24.560]  magazine they had a former retired I think he was a Brigadier General his
[12:24.560 --> 12:30.080]  specialty was demolition and he pointed out you don't get a destruction pattern
[12:30.080 --> 12:34.640]  like that from a point source bomb so you know we've made everybody so paranoid
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.480]  everybody is concerned about that I guess I'm on yet another list because
[12:39.480 --> 12:43.280]  I'm going around trying to get the fertilizer for spirulina but that's the
[12:43.280 --> 12:45.920]  kind of paranoid society we live in but then when you talk to people about
[12:45.920 --> 12:50.400]  things that are real about their cars getting hacked about their phones
[12:50.400 --> 12:53.840]  getting hacked about the government looking at everything they do look at
[12:53.840 --> 12:59.960]  this article here 950 million Android phones can be hijacked by malicious
[12:59.960 --> 13:05.680]  text messages it was just a couple of days ago we saw that all Chrysler Fiat
[13:05.680 --> 13:12.440]  vehicles could be hacked wirelessly so maybe we should be concerned about that
[13:12.440 --> 13:17.080]  maybe we should be concerned at least about the future of these wireless cars
[13:17.080 --> 13:20.320]  if Android phones which have been around for quite a while it's a mature
[13:20.320 --> 13:25.920]  technology again they're still hacking them putting in malicious text messages
[13:25.920 --> 13:29.720]  all I have to do is send you a text message and they can hack your phone
[13:29.720 --> 13:35.160]  they can get control of your phone and it was very simple for these hackers on
[13:35.160 --> 13:39.640]  wired magazine to take over that Jeep let me tell you something I'm not going to
[13:39.640 --> 13:43.280]  be getting behind I'm not gonna there's no wheel to get behind I'm not gonna be
[13:43.280 --> 13:48.200]  getting into a self-driving car without a steering wheel without brakes I will
[13:48.200 --> 13:53.440]  ride a motorcycle I'll ride a bicycle I'll write a skateboard I'll get a horse
[13:53.440 --> 13:58.280]  whatever I'll walk I'm not gonna get in a self-driving car not ever I mean look
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.480]  at what we've seen in the past with people who have in several cases
[14:02.480 --> 14:08.880]  blindly followed Google directions or Apple Maps directions or you know some
[14:08.880 --> 14:15.200]  of these computer mapping programs follow it right into the water follow it
[14:15.200 --> 14:20.840]  down a trail and get stuck in the woods and die or nearly die or in some cases
[14:20.840 --> 14:26.360]  they went around all the signs all the warning signs I told them this road is
[14:26.360 --> 14:29.920]  closed the bridge is out don't go any further and it's like but my computer
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.640]  program tells me to go ahead so they keep driving they go around we round all the
[14:34.640 --> 14:39.840]  signs that are there for humans because they trust the computer so much and they
[14:39.840 --> 14:45.760]  drive off the bridge there's a literal case of that literally a man and his
[14:45.760 --> 14:51.440]  wife she died he survived but they just he kept driving and drove right off of
[14:51.440 --> 14:56.360]  the bridge you know it's a perfect allegory for where we're going with these
[14:56.360 --> 15:00.560]  self-driving cars people don't understand the imminent danger and they
[15:00.560 --> 15:04.280]  don't understand where this is leading they don't understand this is a means to
[15:04.280 --> 15:08.640]  take over your control the control of your transportation to control your
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.760]  movements understand that the interstate system was created for military
[15:13.760 --> 15:18.240]  purposes that's why Hitler created it before the war Eisenhower had written a
[15:18.240 --> 15:24.920]  small book about how difficult it was for him to take a a group of military
[15:24.920 --> 15:28.600]  vehicles from one point in the northeast to another point in the northeast and
[15:28.600 --> 15:32.160]  then when he saw the Autobahn in Germany part of World War two is like we got to
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.160]  do that and it was military primarily of course has been civilian use for it all
[15:36.160 --> 15:40.480]  this time but that's primarily why they built the Autobahn and the interstate
[15:40.480 --> 15:48.240]  system here control of transportation is a main means of controlling a country
[15:48.240 --> 15:55.200]  politically militarily physical control this is why we do not want to have the
[15:55.200 --> 15:59.760]  government controlling each and every vehicle they may be driven by computers
[15:59.760 --> 16:03.000]  but they're going to be controlled by government a government that can restrict
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.200]  your movement for any arbitrary purpose that's the bigger picture the
[16:07.200 --> 16:11.280]  immediate danger is that it's going to drive you into a ditch or drive you off
[16:11.280 --> 16:15.520]  of a bridge or have some kind of a software error I mean who would think
[16:15.520 --> 16:18.640]  that a computer would have a software we're only supposed to worry about human
[16:18.640 --> 16:23.040]  drivers not about human programmers I've seen plenty of human programmers making
[16:23.040 --> 16:26.600]  errors I used to be a programmer myself I made plenty of errors I would never
[16:26.600 --> 16:31.000]  trust a car that was driven by a program that I wrote okay and I'm not going to
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.280]  trust a program that's driven by something that somebody else wrote we
[16:36.280 --> 16:39.760]  ought to be concerned about that but it's just like the situation that we see
[16:39.760 --> 16:45.040]  with guns situation we see with them looking at our emails people can't see
[16:45.040 --> 16:50.320]  the long-term picture they can't see how this is going to broaden out and so
[16:50.320 --> 16:53.640]  they understand some people are starting to understand the need for individual
[16:53.640 --> 16:57.920]  protection for firearms but they don't understand the danger that gun control
[16:57.920 --> 17:02.120]  presents to the population of course we have done many discussions and videos
[17:02.120 --> 17:04.960]  about that here in info wars when I first got here we did a video called
[17:04.960 --> 17:10.240]  democide talking about the history of how gun control has preceded massive
[17:10.240 --> 17:17.480]  control of massive mass murder by the government called democide of course it
[17:17.480 --> 17:22.400]  enables it so people don't understand that and we're going to talk later in
[17:22.400 --> 17:26.920]  this program about a couple of emerging trends of course we've had a lot of news
[17:26.920 --> 17:31.960]  in the last few days about genetics of course we're told the good side of the
[17:31.960 --> 17:36.400]  genetics and every technology has good and bad sides how do we control that how
[17:36.400 --> 17:39.720]  do we control robotics for example so that we don't have killer robots that's
[17:39.720 --> 17:43.360]  been in the news a lot and then of course there was a story at the end of last
[17:43.360 --> 17:48.520]  week on Friday there was a release of a department of defense conference where
[17:48.520 --> 17:53.480]  they were looking at future war the battlefield of 2050 35 years in the
[17:53.480 --> 17:58.680]  future what does that battlefield look like it looks like your worst nightmare
[17:58.680 --> 18:04.880]  you cannot even believe the scenario that they have proposed here to give you a
[18:04.880 --> 18:07.920]  quick overview and we're going to talk about this at the bottom of the hour in
[18:07.920 --> 18:13.760]  detail because it is a convergence of these two trends of genetic modification
[18:13.760 --> 18:19.160]  and of robotics and AI and they're going to converge these they're going to push
[18:19.160 --> 18:22.880]  it it's going to be an arms race that's what everybody is concerned about with
[18:22.880 --> 18:26.520]  killer robots is the arms race aspect of this I've got to build it before the
[18:26.520 --> 18:30.680]  other guy builds it and we push and we push and we push we already spend more
[18:30.680 --> 18:36.640]  than every other country in the world on defense every other country in the world
[18:36.640 --> 18:42.440]  combined on defense we spend more we are creating the threats then we create the
[18:42.440 --> 18:46.080]  response the counter to the threat then we create the counter to the counter to
[18:46.080 --> 18:51.120]  the threat what is this for we're multiplying death and suffering the
[18:51.120 --> 18:54.520]  only people profiting from it are the military industrial complex and the
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.680]  standing army and we need to take a close look at where this is going because
[18:58.680 --> 19:03.360]  in 10 years it's going to be too late to stop this it may already be too late to
[19:03.360 --> 19:06.360]  stop this we need to understand where this is going so we're going to talk
[19:06.360 --> 19:10.600]  about these converging trends of genetics and killer robots because the
[19:10.600 --> 19:17.000]  battlefield of 2050 is going to be filled with killer robots and superhuman
[19:17.000 --> 19:23.040]  genetically modified warriors these are not going to be Captain America these
[19:23.040 --> 19:27.200]  are going to be winter soldiers because they are going to get their hooks into
[19:27.200 --> 19:32.960]  their minds as well we're going to create a super elite group of cyborgs
[19:32.960 --> 19:37.440]  who have implants in them who have been genetically modified to withstand
[19:37.440 --> 19:41.720]  deprivation to be super strong to have equipment themselves but for the most
[19:41.720 --> 19:46.000]  part they want to make sure that these killer robots will be able to operate so
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.120]  quickly that they don't even want the enhanced humans to control them this is
[19:52.120 --> 19:57.000]  called plausible deniability or an alibi depending on which killers you're

[25:58.160 --> 26:01.040]  like to talk a little bit about some of the political news of course people
[26:01.040 --> 26:07.160]  running for president it's interesting to see right now we're not really getting
[26:07.160 --> 26:12.360]  much in terms of issues we're seeing a lot of personalities involved Camille
[26:12.360 --> 26:17.720]  Poglia has something to say about Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton
[26:17.720 --> 26:22.520]  and so on she says how Bill Clinton is like Bill Cosby and I would also
[26:22.520 --> 26:27.240]  point out that Hillary Clinton is like Bill Clinton the three of them are
[26:27.240 --> 26:34.040]  three P's and a pod you know when she gets caught with these classified emails
[26:34.040 --> 26:40.960]  her flat-out denials her parsing her pervercation it's just so much like Bill
[26:40.960 --> 26:45.440]  Clinton as I point out she says she did not have textual relations with those
[26:45.440 --> 26:51.680]  classified documents it's not credible 55,000 pages of emails on her private
[26:51.680 --> 26:54.480]  servers what she has turned over we don't know how many she had totally
[26:54.480 --> 26:58.360]  because of course it was a private email they've only been able to go through
[26:58.360 --> 27:02.000]  40 of those emails they found the inspector general has found four of the
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.600]  40 that he's looked at had classified material in them but here's what Camille
[27:05.600 --> 27:10.800]  Poglia says about the character of these people talking about Bill Clinton she
[27:10.800 --> 27:14.720]  says the horrible truth is that the feminist establishment the US led by
[27:14.720 --> 27:19.360]  Gloria Steinem did in fact apply a double standard to Bill Clinton's behavior
[27:19.360 --> 27:24.040]  because he was a Democrat the Democrat president and administration supported
[27:24.040 --> 27:29.960]  abortion rights therefore it didn't matter what his perspective was because
[27:29.960 --> 27:35.440]  of course abortion is the ultimate sacrament to the feminist led by
[27:35.440 --> 27:39.840]  Gloria Steinem and others so they didn't really care what he did to women
[27:39.840 --> 27:43.240]  because they don't care what he does to small women why would they care what he
[27:43.240 --> 27:47.840]  does to adult women she goes on to say the fact of the matter is that Bill
[27:47.840 --> 27:53.640]  Clinton was a serial abuser of working-class women he had exploited the
[27:53.640 --> 28:00.280]  power differential even in Arkansas this is Camille Poglia a real feminist he
[28:00.280 --> 28:03.720]  doesn't pull any punches she tells it like it is it's gonna be very interesting
[28:03.720 --> 28:07.360]  to see what she says about some of these other candidates but she pulls no
[28:07.360 --> 28:10.080]  punches when she talks about the Clintons she says my publicly stated
[28:10.080 --> 28:14.120]  opinion at the time was I don't care what public figures do it's their private
[28:14.120 --> 28:18.040]  life there's a very sophisticated style about that among the French and so forth
[28:18.040 --> 28:24.560]  and so on well yes but the reality is is that he was impeached because he
[28:24.560 --> 28:32.160]  committed perjury that's the legal term for lying under oath he's a lawyer he's
[28:32.160 --> 28:36.600]  a president he knew better than that they say a cigar in an intern is
[28:36.600 --> 28:41.400]  certainly the opposite of sophisticated okay he didn't get impeached because he
[28:41.400 --> 28:46.240]  was sophisticated he got impeached because of sophistry because of lying
[28:46.240 --> 28:52.320]  because of perjury it's a legal definition he knows better she says the
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.720]  Clintons are responsible for the destruction of Monica Lewinsky again
[28:56.720 --> 29:01.880]  this is Camille Poglia she says it's like something out of withering heights or
[29:01.880 --> 29:06.840]  great expectations the way this whole thing has played out the destruction of
[29:06.840 --> 29:10.880]  character I think that's a very important thing that's why I talked about
[29:10.880 --> 29:14.960]  what we know about Donald Trump how did he get his money of course he doesn't
[29:14.960 --> 29:20.960]  rely on donations like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush and these others but how
[29:20.960 --> 29:25.920]  did he get his money he's perfectly capable when he's building his casinos
[29:25.920 --> 29:30.600]  of throwing people out of their homes using the government for eminent
[29:30.600 --> 29:35.160]  domain to steal other people's property for private use I don't care if the
[29:35.160 --> 29:39.480]  Supreme Court said it was okay the Constitution says it's not okay it's not
[29:39.480 --> 29:43.800]  moral to do that it's a lack of character when you make money doing that and
[29:43.800 --> 29:47.120]  we still see it happening with the keystone pipeline project stay with
[29:47.120 --> 29:53.160]  us be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:53.160 --> 30:02.400]  GCN radio network a third video of Planned Parenthood has been released where a
[30:02.400 --> 30:07.240]  whistleblower reveals it's basically a huge trafficking of fetal tissues the
[30:07.240 --> 30:11.200]  video features whistleblower Holly O'Donnell who claims that a biomedical
[30:11.200 --> 30:15.160]  company she was working for was in the business of paying Planned Parenthood
[30:15.160 --> 30:19.640]  clinics for fetal organs according to the condition of the tissues after being
[30:19.640 --> 30:24.240]  extracted from an abortion O'Donnell a former technician for California based
[30:24.240 --> 30:28.960]  Stern Express says the more valuable the tissue the more money you get so if you
[30:28.960 --> 30:33.040]  can somehow procure a brain or heart you're going to get more money than just
[30:33.040 --> 30:36.680]  umbilical cord so I guess that's incentive to try to get the hard stuff
[30:36.680 --> 30:41.720]  because they get more money she added in the documentary style footage and as we
[30:41.720 --> 30:46.320]  reported last week Planned Parenthood is engaging in desperate damage control
[30:46.320 --> 30:51.080]  preemptively notifying Congress that it believed that undercover journalist had
[30:51.080 --> 30:55.760]  footage of clinics harvesting fetal organs you can find more reports on

[33:38.040 --> 33:41.320]  many different aspects of that we've seen what happened in Greece we also know
[33:41.320 --> 33:44.720]  what's happening with the transatlantic partnership with the trans-specific
[33:44.720 --> 33:50.560]  partnership as Alex reported yesterday Obama is a hero in the British press why
[33:50.560 --> 33:55.680]  well because he's pushing the transatlantic partnership because he's
[33:55.680 --> 34:01.640]  telling the UK don't leave the European Union you're an important transatlantic
[34:01.640 --> 34:07.920]  partner so they don't want member states to start leaving the European Union
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.280]  because the European Union is a construct that is supposed to now be
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.440]  joined to the North American Union to Asia that's exactly what the plan has
[34:16.440 --> 34:20.960]  been for very long time that's what the trilateral Commission talked about
[34:20.960 --> 34:24.120]  that's the structure that they had the three different regions then being
[34:24.120 --> 34:28.080]  unified into a global government so we're gonna be talking to Alex Jones from
[34:28.080 --> 34:32.440]  Europe Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us Abby Johnson a former
[34:32.440 --> 34:36.680]  Planned Parenthood employee of the year turned whistleblower is going to be
[34:36.680 --> 34:40.400]  talking to us today and we're going to be covering this new Planned Parenthood
[34:40.400 --> 34:45.440]  video when she arrives in studio in this segment I wanted to talk about these
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.400]  emerging trends the genetic modifications so many articles we've seen
[34:49.400 --> 34:53.400]  about this on Drudge and elsewhere for the last several days as well as the
[34:53.400 --> 35:00.280]  concerns the rifle concerns that many prominent scientists have about robots
[35:00.280 --> 35:04.560]  killer robots getting out of control the militarization of artificial
[35:04.560 --> 35:10.280]  intelligence and robotics the next generation and how this is all converging
[35:10.280 --> 35:14.400]  in the Department of Defense's plans their plans of how they envision the
[35:14.400 --> 35:20.040]  future battlefield which is a combination of killer robots and augmented
[35:20.040 --> 35:23.760]  humans let's start with the genetics aspect of it of course in the last couple
[35:23.760 --> 35:29.160]  of days we had this story about how Google-backed Calico is partnering with
[35:29.160 --> 35:34.440]  ancestry.com and of course this is going to beat the specter of aging you're
[35:34.440 --> 35:38.560]  going to be able to live forever that's the promise okay they're going to solve
[35:38.560 --> 35:45.000]  all diseases they're going to give you longevity and if you believe that I've
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.080]  got a bridge I will sell you because if they were to crack any of this stuff
[35:49.080 --> 35:53.080]  they're going to keep it for themselves these are the same same people who are
[35:53.080 --> 35:56.640]  radical depopulationists these are the same people who have come up with
[35:56.640 --> 36:03.080]  agenda 21 they want to confine people the rest of the people into small areas
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.640]  and keep the vast majority of the world off limits to them but of course there's
[36:07.640 --> 36:11.880]  also a very troubling aspect of this that they're going into ancestry.com and
[36:11.880 --> 36:16.400]  picking through the genetic information there so that also brings up a very and
[36:16.400 --> 36:19.600]  that's a very troubling when you look at that wired magazine article I don't know
[36:19.600 --> 36:24.200]  what that's about these eyeballs there's like 3d eyeballs are looking in every
[36:24.200 --> 36:27.720]  different direction individual ones it's very disturbing I'm not really sure
[36:27.720 --> 36:31.000]  what that has to do with DNA but we're going to talk about that article and
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.880]  link that as well they say we've been looking at and frankly responding to
[36:34.880 --> 36:38.960]  inquiries we've had from another part number of parties about ways that we
[36:38.960 --> 36:42.480]  can collaborate to take the data that we've aggregated historically understand
[36:42.480 --> 36:45.520]  as Alex Jones has been pointing out for a very long time they've been collecting
[36:45.520 --> 36:49.960]  blood samples at birth surreptitiously for a very long time throughout the
[36:49.960 --> 36:53.840]  United States why do you think they're doing that well this is part of it but
[36:53.840 --> 36:57.720]  they're also going through and looking at things like ancestry.com seeing who
[36:57.720 --> 37:01.360]  live the longest so they can take a closer look at those individuals who are
[37:01.360 --> 37:07.080]  descended from people who had a long who lived for a very long time. Another
[37:07.080 --> 37:10.080]  example of this comes from Bloomberg Business this came out in the last
[37:10.080 --> 37:15.840]  couple days superhumans who are real and their DNA could be worth
[37:15.840 --> 37:19.560]  billions exactly they're talking about people who have a congenital
[37:19.560 --> 37:24.440]  insensitivity to pain or people who have bones so dense that they can walk away
[37:24.440 --> 37:28.880]  from accidents that would leave others with broken limbs here's one professor
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.320]  of medicine in the Netherlands he went into a community where he noticed that
[37:33.320 --> 37:37.840]  the population had overgrown skulls abnormally large bones he went to a town
[37:37.840 --> 37:41.320]  meeting and he asked if anybody had been in a major car accident one man raised
[37:41.320 --> 37:45.440]  his hand he said I was crossing the street with my brother and a Mercedes
[37:45.440 --> 37:49.880]  was coming and I didn't have time to move and I said what happened and he said
[37:49.880 --> 37:54.560]  you should have seen the Mercedes so they want to go through and they want to
[37:54.560 --> 37:58.640]  mine this information so it's not just Calico which is now associated with
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.560]  Google it's also 23andMe which was associated with one of the Google
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.520]  founders XY's I guess so they split so now they have two different two
[38:08.520 --> 38:12.680]  different startups but there's many many different companies that are doing
[38:12.680 --> 38:17.760]  this Amgen just bought an Icelandic biotechnology company for four hundred
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.960]  and fifteen million dollars a couple of years ago what is this about the
[38:22.960 --> 38:28.160]  disturbing thing about this is the money involved of course and in this wired
[38:28.160 --> 38:34.240]  magazine article that we just had up on the screen a while back that was talking
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.480]  about the Genesis engine talking about new software that's come out and they
[38:38.480 --> 38:42.440]  go back to a conference where they talked to a scientist that was a
[38:42.440 --> 38:48.000]  conference 1975 40 years ago the biologists came together they realized
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.680]  that they were able to do some things with the basic theory that had been
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.320]  discovered less than 20 years earlier by Crick and Watson about DNA they
[38:57.320 --> 39:01.400]  realized they could have some practical applications as they could directly
[39:01.400 --> 39:08.680]  modify the the genes of animals they could do transgenic combination in other
[39:08.680 --> 39:13.640]  words not just selectively breeding your dogs or your horses or your cows for a
[39:13.640 --> 39:19.160]  particular effect but going in and taking genes from one species of animal
[39:19.160 --> 39:24.040]  and combining them into another and then going in and directly modifying the
[39:24.040 --> 39:28.560]  human genome or other genomes but at the time they said we don't really have to
[39:28.560 --> 39:32.800]  that they were coming up with some ethics statements that were going to guide
[39:32.800 --> 39:36.280]  them there wasn't any outside source that was concerned about it at the time
[39:36.280 --> 39:41.720]  1975 and so they came up with their own ethics statements that were really
[39:41.720 --> 39:45.120]  non-binding they said we don't really even have to worry about humans because
[39:45.120 --> 39:51.440]  that's so far off in the future take this to today and that's the what that
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.040]  article is about 40 years later now things have changed considerably they
[39:56.040 --> 40:00.640]  now have something called CRISPR which is some software that lets them go in if
[40:00.640 --> 40:05.640]  you've seen Jurassic Park they don't really go into it in that much detail in
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.560]  the book they go into it in a great deal of detail if you remember in the movie
[40:10.560 --> 40:16.240]  there's the Asian scientist Henry Wu in the book they explain in detail how he's
[40:16.240 --> 40:20.360]  got the software where he can repetitively go in with the fragments of
[40:20.360 --> 40:24.600]  DNA that they're able to recover they combine them of course with amphibians
[40:24.600 --> 40:28.720]  that's part of what goes wrong at Jurassic Park those amphibians then are
[40:28.720 --> 40:33.280]  able to change their sex and multiply in the wild they'd originally just
[40:33.280 --> 40:37.920]  created female dinosaurs to keep that from happening but the other aspect of
[40:37.920 --> 40:42.800]  it was these partial fragments of DNA they would be able to go in and
[40:42.800 --> 40:48.080]  repetitively change things if something if there was a defect in the animal they
[40:48.080 --> 40:52.000]  would analyze that they would go in and change that in the DNA they're now able
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.840]  to do that in real life that's what CRISPR is about the tools that they have
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.640]  now are so much more advanced than these scientists could envision 40 years ago
[41:02.640 --> 41:08.240]  it has taken place at a much more rapid pace but I want to go back to Jurassic
[41:08.240 --> 41:12.520]  Park because in 1990 when Michael Crichton wrote the book yes it's
[41:12.520 --> 41:18.360]  entertainment but there is some serious principles that are laid out in that
[41:18.360 --> 41:22.960]  let's go to the introduction where he talks about the incident with the whole
[41:22.960 --> 41:27.440]  book is based on he says the late 20th century had witnessed a scientific
[41:27.440 --> 41:30.960]  gold rush of astonishing proportions the headlong furious haste to
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.080]  commercialize genetic engineering this enterprise had proceeded so rapidly with
[41:36.080 --> 41:40.800]  so little outside commentary that its dimensions and its implications are
[41:40.800 --> 41:44.880]  hardly understood at all the biotechnology revolution differs in three
[41:44.880 --> 41:49.080]  important respects from past scientific transformations he said first of all it's
[41:49.080 --> 41:54.560]  broad-based he said 500 corporations he's writing this now in 1990 and this is
[41:54.560 --> 42:00.360]  factual he begins the book with a factual statement of where it is and what his
[42:00.360 --> 42:05.320]  ethical concerns are about it before he gets into the fictional Jurassic Park at
[42:05.320 --> 42:09.600]  the time he wrote it 1990 said 500 corporations spend five billion dollars
[42:09.600 --> 42:14.080]  a year on this technology they said number two much of the research is
[42:14.080 --> 42:18.400]  thoughtless or frivolous you want to breed pale or trout for better
[42:18.400 --> 42:23.520]  visibility in the stream square trees for easier lumbering injectable scent so
[42:23.520 --> 42:27.480]  you'll be able to always smell like your favorite perfume those may seem like a
[42:27.480 --> 42:32.080]  joke but they're not in fact that biotechnology can be applied to
[42:32.080 --> 42:36.440]  industries traditionally subject to the vagaries of fashion like cosmetics
[42:36.440 --> 42:42.200]  and leisure it heightens concern about the whimsical use of this powerful new
[42:42.200 --> 42:47.640]  technology and then third he says this work is uncontrolled no one
[42:47.640 --> 42:53.240]  supervises it no laws regulate it but the most disturbing fact he says is that
[42:53.240 --> 42:58.120]  no watchdogs are found among the scientists themselves it's remarkable
[42:58.120 --> 43:02.300]  that nearly every scientist in genetics research is also engaged in the
[43:02.300 --> 43:07.480]  commerce of biotechnology there are no detached observers everybody has a
[43:07.480 --> 43:11.720]  stake the commercialization of molecular biology is the most stunning
[43:11.720 --> 43:14.920]  ethical event in the history of science and it has happened with an
[43:14.920 --> 43:20.320]  astonishing speed he wrote this 25 years ago Michael Crichton did he was a very
[43:20.320 --> 43:26.000]  perceptive individual a vast multi-billion dollar commercial undertaking
[43:26.000 --> 43:32.440]  and its origins can be traced not to 1953 but to April 1976 that was one year
[43:32.440 --> 43:36.520]  after this conference that the fellow who's relating this to in in Wired
[43:36.520 --> 43:39.400]  magazine talks about so after they get together say where there's certain things
[43:39.400 --> 43:43.520]  that we're not going to do the next year a venture capitalist and a biochemist
[43:43.520 --> 43:47.080]  from the University of California get together and create a new company
[43:47.080 --> 43:52.460]  Genentech he says it quickly became the largest and most successful of the
[43:52.460 --> 43:58.120]  genetic engineering startups that is essentially what this Wired magazine
[43:58.120 --> 44:03.120]  article is talking about 140 scientists that gathered in 1975 for a conference
[44:03.120 --> 44:08.280]  but he said 40 years later now they're getting together in Napa in California
[44:08.280 --> 44:14.560]  again talking about access to this gene editing technique called CRISPR-Cas9 he
[44:14.560 --> 44:18.360]  says it's basically the name comes from a description of the genetic basis of the
[44:18.360 --> 44:23.400]  method and Cas9 is the protein that makes it work he says these are
[44:23.400 --> 44:28.240]  monumental moments in the history of biomedical research what could possibly
[44:28.240 --> 44:36.280]  go wrong Michael Crichton talked about the thin intelligence of the scientist
[44:36.280 --> 44:40.760]  saying yes they see very narrowly they don't see the broad picture they don't
[44:40.760 --> 44:45.840]  see the surrounding area they don't see the consequences that are coming let me
[44:45.840 --> 44:50.200]  tell you some of the consequences that we've already seen CDC to review
[44:50.200 --> 44:56.840]  oversight of bioterror labs after USA Today investigation that was July 21st
[44:56.840 --> 45:02.720]  we've had another article from USA Today today Congress questions
[45:02.720 --> 45:06.640]  oversight of biolab safety at a hearing federal laboratories working with
[45:06.640 --> 45:12.520]  bioterror pathogens are the quote leading offenders repeatingly repeatedly
[45:12.520 --> 45:17.320]  being referred for sanctions because of safety violations yet regulators from
[45:17.320 --> 45:20.480]  the Department of Health and Human Services have largely responded with
[45:20.480 --> 45:24.360]  violation letters and their efforts to ensure safe operations in other words
[45:24.360 --> 45:29.760]  they're not doing anything one of the congressman Tim Murphy from Pennsylvania
[45:29.760 --> 45:34.240]  said what we have here is a pattern of recurring issues of complacency of a
[45:34.240 --> 45:38.720]  lax culture of safety this is the federal labs this is not even the private
[45:38.720 --> 45:43.680]  labs these are the federal labs run by the CDC who is Brit who are bringing in
[45:43.680 --> 45:50.560]  deadly pathogens that are not native in America enhancing them into bio weapons
[45:50.560 --> 45:55.880]  they call them select agents they call the enhancements gain a function to make
[45:55.880 --> 46:01.520]  them easier to transmit more deadly if you cap if you catch the disease now
[46:01.520 --> 46:05.040]  what could possibly go wrong well we've already had if you remember those a lot
[46:05.040 --> 46:09.360]  of stories about the pentagons anthrax blunders shipping live anthrax through
[46:09.360 --> 46:13.760]  the regular mail system that was a story in the last couple of weeks that's one
[46:13.760 --> 46:17.920]  of the things that's brought this to light of course USA Today Alison Young is
[46:17.920 --> 46:23.120]  an investigative journalist there she has been on this story she deserves some
[46:23.120 --> 46:28.240]  kind of award I mean it is amazing how she has covered this it's a one-woman
[46:28.240 --> 46:34.640]  investigative journalist effort here she pointed out in previous articles that
[46:34.640 --> 46:40.480]  there's over 200 biosafety lab level three and level four throughout the
[46:40.480 --> 46:46.200]  country and you can see the map there if you go to their their site and half of
[46:46.200 --> 46:51.840]  those hundred of those have had accidents bios level safety three and
[46:51.840 --> 46:56.560]  level four now we've got an article up the day at Info Wars a university
[46:56.560 --> 47:03.000]  professor says that Ebola is genetically modified a lab-made virus and I want to
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.920]  ask you if that sounds like a conspiracy theory to you think about the fact
[47:06.920 --> 47:15.280]  that Tulane University was involved in an accident with Birkhold Daria pseudomali
[47:15.280 --> 47:18.920]  eye a deadly bacteria that was brought in the United States not indigenous here
[47:18.920 --> 47:23.040]  very small area of the world where it was found really only two countries in
[47:23.040 --> 47:26.640]  the world where it was found they brought it in here to make a weapon out of it
[47:26.640 --> 47:33.960]  they were messing with it at Tulane's national primate research lab and it got
[47:33.960 --> 47:38.520]  out of the bio level safety is three or four lab got into the wild it got into
[47:38.520 --> 47:44.160]  the 500 acres there they had a scientist multiple agencies were there one of
[47:44.160 --> 47:49.400]  them then tested positive for Birkhold Daria pseudomali eye it's in the wild
[47:49.400 --> 47:54.720]  there now thank you CDC so it escaped they still don't have an explanation for
[47:54.720 --> 47:59.280]  how it got out in spite of many investigation teams there we know that
[47:59.280 --> 48:04.480]  Tulane same University was involved in the Tuskegee experiments deliberately
[48:04.480 --> 48:12.080]  deliberately giving syphilis to black people telling some of them that they
[48:12.080 --> 48:16.640]  were getting treatments that already had had syphilis and not giving them
[48:16.640 --> 48:20.280]  treatments so we know that they're ethically capable of it we know that
[48:20.280 --> 48:24.680]  they can have mistakes and we know that at the time that we had this latest
[48:24.680 --> 48:29.720]  outbreak of Ebola in Sierra Leone that Tulane University had a laboratory
[48:29.720 --> 48:34.280]  there working on hemorrhagic fevers the Sierra Leone government believed that
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.760]  they were responsible the Sierra Leone government threw them out so I have to
[48:38.760 --> 48:42.560]  ask you do you think that our government do you think a government that funds
[48:42.560 --> 48:50.640]  abortion is morally capable of releasing as a test pathogens you don't even have
[48:50.640 --> 48:55.160]  to take that as a theory we've seen it happen happened in San Francisco they
[48:55.160 --> 49:00.080]  released tests in the New York Subways and Boston Subways they say they were
[49:00.080 --> 49:04.840]  benign we don't know we don't know what our government is doing to us they've
[49:04.840 --> 49:09.280]  lied to soldiers about the effects of things that they've exposed them to
[49:09.280 --> 49:14.200]  nuclear weapons tests then we have Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking's and Steve
[49:14.200 --> 49:20.080]  Wozniak in the last couple of days say saying say no to Skynet they call for an
[49:20.080 --> 49:24.880]  artificial intelligence weapons ban and of course there's many different aspects
[49:24.880 --> 49:28.320]  about this there's a concern amongst many people like Hugo Deguerre so we've
[49:28.320 --> 49:33.200]  talked about that generalized artificial intelligence may in fact recreate the
[49:33.200 --> 49:38.920]  terminator scenario this is not life imitating art understand that Hollywood
[49:38.920 --> 49:43.640]  is given these scenarios by people who are doing the research they're given
[49:43.640 --> 49:47.320]  scenarios by the CIA they're given research by the Department of Defense
[49:47.320 --> 49:54.200]  they want to get you accustomed to the future they want you to see all of the
[49:54.200 --> 49:57.640]  horror that they are planning and then they want to wrap it up at the bottom
[49:57.640 --> 50:01.400]  with a happy ending so you don't get too freaked out and do anything about it
[50:01.400 --> 50:07.560]  they just want you to get accustomed to it they want to move the Overton window
[50:07.560 --> 50:11.960]  that's what they're doing with these movies so we see many people coming out
[50:11.960 --> 50:17.840]  pointing out that this is a problem we have the campaign to stop killer robots
[50:17.840 --> 50:23.220]  that is going on in the UK now let's go to where these converge not only the
[50:23.220 --> 50:26.600]  automated when I talk about killer robots let me explain that these are
[50:26.600 --> 50:32.080]  drones these are machines they're planes they're tanks there may be devices like
[50:32.080 --> 50:37.040]  you've seen DARPA funding that look like four-legged animals with knees going
[50:37.040 --> 50:42.760]  the wrong ways running over all kinds of terrain weaponized and able to kill
[50:42.760 --> 50:48.760]  without human intervention because you can wipe out a lot of people with
[50:48.760 --> 50:52.120]  plausible deniability if you release one of these things and say it was just a
[50:52.120 --> 50:55.200]  software stay with us when we come back I want to show you how this all ties
[50:55.200 --> 51:00.560]  together in the Pentagon's vision of the future so I say the market lunch look

[55:51.320 --> 55:53.800]  is they've looked at these trends like we've been talking about things that
[55:53.800 --> 55:57.600]  have really erupted in the news lately a lot of people very concerned Elon Musk
[55:57.600 --> 56:01.440]  Stephen Hawking Steve Wozniak all people concerned like Noel Sharkey and
[56:01.440 --> 56:05.360]  others that we talked to you go to garris all concerned that artificial
[56:05.360 --> 56:09.160]  intelligence is getting out of control concerned about an arms race where you
[56:09.160 --> 56:13.800]  have autonomous killing machines killing machines that make their decisions
[56:13.800 --> 56:19.400]  without human input it just send them out and let them start killing in an
[56:19.400 --> 56:23.280]  area and let me describe to you what this battlefield is going to look like
[56:23.280 --> 56:26.280]  because it's not only the killer robots which are the predominant factor there
[56:26.280 --> 56:32.960]  but in the Pentagon's vision of the future they also see augmented elitist
[56:32.960 --> 56:39.320]  cyborg superhumans genetically modified people with implants connected to some
[56:39.320 --> 56:42.960]  of these robots although most of them will be operating autonomously this is
[56:42.960 --> 56:47.920]  a report that came out from Pentagon visualizing tactical ground battlefield
[56:47.920 --> 56:54.280]  in the year 2050 this is a report that actually was picked up it came out of
[56:54.280 --> 57:01.560]  the U.S. Army Research Lab it was picked up by a Australian source we picked
[57:01.560 --> 57:07.080]  it up from them not much coverage in the U.S. press let me give you the table of
[57:07.080 --> 57:11.320]  contents here first of all they broke it down into two areas one of them is
[57:11.320 --> 57:14.600]  seeing communicating understanding decision-making the other one is
[57:14.600 --> 57:18.200]  actually the fighting aspect of it here's some of the topics and the seeing
[57:18.200 --> 57:22.440]  communicating understanding area let me ask if some of these sound familiar if
[57:22.440 --> 57:25.640]  they sound like what we've been talking about with the Jade helm programming
[57:25.640 --> 57:30.600]  with the special forces augmented humans then automated decision-making and
[57:30.600 --> 57:35.520]  autonomous processes misinformation as a weapon yeah that's what special forces
[57:35.520 --> 57:40.360]  and unconventional warfare about misinformation as a weapon micro
[57:40.360 --> 57:44.640]  targeting that's what geospatial intelligence human domain analytics
[57:44.640 --> 57:48.400]  activity-based intelligence that's what that is about micro targeting
[57:48.400 --> 57:53.280]  individuals cognitive modeling of the opponent so forth we go to the actual
[57:53.280 --> 57:56.280]  fighting listen to what they have ubiquitous robots in other words on the
[57:56.280 --> 58:00.840]  battlefield robots are everywhere most of them killer robots making their own
[58:00.840 --> 58:07.720]  decisions they work in swarms as my son Lance said nothing good ever comes in a
[58:07.720 --> 58:13.400]  swarm superhumans directed energy weapons that's things like laser beams
[58:13.400 --> 58:19.480]  force feels force feels they're already working on them folks other things like
[58:19.480 --> 58:24.160]  invisibility cloaks it is a nightmare scenario I don't have time to go into
[58:24.160 --> 58:30.240]  all of this but we have to as a people come to grips with an out of control
[58:30.240 --> 58:35.800]  militarized industrial complex a standing army and stop this before it gets to this
[58:35.800 --> 58:44.120]  nightmare scenario this will be right back thank you for listening to GCN visit

[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:28.760]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host in
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.680]  Austin we're going now to Paul Joseph Watson one of our reporters certainly if
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.080]  you go to info wars.com if you're familiar with our site you have seen Paul
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.240]  Joseph Watson's stories many many times and Paul Joseph Watson is going to be
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.240]  joining us from the UK we're also going to be joined later in the hour with Alex
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.520]  Jones who is also in the UK doing investigative reporting going throughout
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:57.240]  Europe. Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson Paul we have a report from you about a
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.760]  bank telling a third party whenever customers are physically visiting that
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.640]  bank location welcome Paul tell us about that. Hi David yeah we're here live in the
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.600]  city of London and this story revolves around an email I received last night
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.640]  from an individual who is a customer at Halifax Bank she's one of the big banks
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.960]  here in the UK and he said that he had received a call from a market research
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:29.880]  group asking him why he visited the bank the previous Friday so we asked the
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.040]  research group involved we asked Halifax Bank what was going on turns out
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:39.120]  they've got a policy whereby they are tracking people's physical movements
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.880]  when they actually visit the bank and this individual in question didn't even
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.160]  speak to anyone in the bank he merely visited the ATM machine to make a cash
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.680]  withdrawal so it turns out that they're passing on this information the bank is
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.160]  to this third party and then phoning people up and asking them why they
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.760]  visited the bank and you know under the guise of customer service. Yeah under the
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.080]  guise of creepy customer service it's definitely creepy that they're
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.560]  following everything that you do of course that's what people need to
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.960]  understand I hope that people are starting to understand the total
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:19.440]  surveillance that we're under the creepy intrusions into our private life and
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.440]  how we have so many different corporations as well as a thing that
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.040]  concerns me even more so I think is what the government is doing in terms of
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.440]  mapping our locations we know that that's there it's just that they're not as
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.320]  obvious about it well yeah and we we know from Bilderberg that one of their
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.280]  prime topics for conversation we've reported on this before the conference
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.160]  was capital controls so you've got numerous individuals in the in top
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.440]  finance industry in places like Germany and elsewhere calling for the abolition
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.920]  of cash calling for these capital controls to be imposed on customers so
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.600]  we're being treated with more suspicion you know HSBC recently introduced the
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.800]  policy to cause massive controversy whereby if you withdraw more than 5,000
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.200]  pounds in cash they need documentation as to how you're going to spend that
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.320]  cash and why you're withdrawing the money so as the controls become tighter on
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.760]  us the controls the regulations become looser on banks like HSBC and they get
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:24.040]  away with money and drug laundering they try to make it intense control they
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.800]  try to make it look Paul as if cash the desire to have cash or the withdrawal of
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.760]  cash that you put into the bank that was vetted when it went in and then you take
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.360]  it out that's a reportable event as well because they want to make that look as
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.400]  if it's a criminal activity as if you're engaged in something that is criminal
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:46.760]  you're part of a black market or you're a money launderer for drugs but it's
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.720]  HSBC that actually did launder billions of dollars for drug cartels they
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.680]  actually gave the Sinaloa cartel the people that we've heard all this talk
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.120]  about El Chapo who escaped from prison he was head of the Sinaloa cartel they
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.360]  had their own private window at an HSBC bank where they could go with their cash
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:11.560]  to launder it and nobody in the city of London went to jail nobody in the US went
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.760]  to jail from HSBC no individuals were fined and it was a very very small slap
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:21.760]  on the wrist for that corporation in terms of the profits that they got yeah
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:28.200]  and also with HSBC of course they help wealthy people hide taxes so again we're
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.400]  being told we need to be investigated for that and then it's being covered up
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.800]  when it applies to them and what they do for their claim so that's why people are
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.680]  really pissed off about that right now yes stay with us you can be right back
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.640]  we've got Paul Joseph Watson reporting live from the city of London right there
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.160]  in the financial district will be right back with Paul Joseph Watson and Alex
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:58.640]  Jones from London stay with us
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.960]  only days after the deal with Iran was sealed
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:06.560]  Secretary of Defense Aston Carter said the possibility of Iranian aggression
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.800]  and the possibility that Iran will not obey the agreement which is why we will
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.760]  keep the military option which was the alternative to a deal John Kerry echoed
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.360]  Carter's diplomatic blunder by attempting to calm the fears of Jewish
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.520]  leaders at a meeting that would later be described as an intense exchange
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.240]  speaking at the Council of Foreign Relations Kerry claimed Israel would get
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.920]  the blame if Congress voted down the nuclear deal meanwhile British
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.520]  authorities were so blinded by the Obama administration's one-sided nuclear deal

[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.640]  radio network
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.600]  welcome back to this live edition of the Alex Jones radio show on David Knight
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.960]  in Austin joining us in the UK is Paul Joseph Watson we're also going to be
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:28.400]  talking to Alex Jones in the UK as well also in London but joining us from the
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:33.480]  City of London the Banking Center of London is Paul Joseph Watson Paul we
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.080]  were just talking about the article that you have up on info wars.com bank tells
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.280]  a third party when customers are physically visiting those banks we were
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:47.000]  talking about how they look at everything that we do they treat as
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:54.640]  suspicious any activity of us handling cash that's being put into the overton
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.960]  window as something that is criminal activities either tax evasion or
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.600]  evidence of being involved in a black market involved in the selling of drugs
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:09.600]  and yet the giant banks like HSBC do launder money for the biggest of the
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.960]  drug cartels and no one goes to jail no one gets fine the corporation itself
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.920]  doesn't have its charter pulled they get a very small fine even though they set up
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:23.800]  a special window for the Sinaloa cartel El Chapo the guy that just escaped from
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:28.120]  prison was the head of the Sinaloa cartel and they get their own private
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:32.520]  window that's how pervasive the money laundering was inside of HSB nothing
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.080]  happens to these big banks are standing right there on the street in the middle
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.320]  of all these big banks that nothing happens to and yet they want to know
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:44.440]  everything about us all the details of our lives yeah and remember that this was
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:49.000]  a 40 million dollar fine the most recent one for HSBC then they had three
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.480]  representatives immediately after that was in the news attending Bilderberg
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:59.280]  from HSBC including one who was the head of the BBC trust so again that cozy
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.440]  relationship between banks and the media discussing how to put more capital
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.840]  controls on us while themselves getting away with these monumental crimes so
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.080]  yeah recap the recap your story for those who are just joining us a lot of
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:18.040]  people don't hear the the first segment of the hour recap the events that that
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.880]  caused you to write this article and question what had happened yeah I was
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.000]  contacted by an individual yesterday who said that he tried he went to the bank
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.440]  to withdraw money last week last night last evening he received a call from this
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.400]  market research company this third party wanting to talk to him about his
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:41.600]  account at Halifax Bank and they said oh we know you were at the bank last Friday
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.680]  gave him the date and time and he had only gone to the bank to withdraw money
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.680]  from an ATM he didn't even speak to any bank employees within Halifax Bank so
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.960]  we already know that you know banks are tracking when we use the ATM but this is
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.140]  somebody who they passed the information on to a third party now it's in a
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:06.440]  database so they know physically where you're going when you use the bank at
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:11.360]  what time selling that information to third parties you know then call people
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.840]  up and ask them about it yeah creepy I yeah it is creepy I remember a horror
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.880]  film the premise was I know who you are I saw what you did right it's a prank call
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.760]  by some kids you're just calling people at random and they call a guy who's
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.880]  actually a criminal but this is the creepiness of it that's essentially what
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.120]  this this network research organization is doing they say hey we saw what you
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.920]  did we know who you are we know when you did it what you do what's even creepier
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.800]  about this when people need to understand is that this is part of a trend of the
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:43.600]  surveillance state of law enforcement it's called pre-crime profiling that's
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.520]  the sinister aspect of it and the aspect that everything that we do is
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:54.960]  available to them for micro inspection for data mining for analysis and putting
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.680]  all this together and seeing who pops up in their database as a criminal perhaps
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.400]  and that has a lot of potential a lot of dangerous potential for people being
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.880]  falsely flagged as a someone who is committing a crime when they really
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.920]  aren't and of course we know what happens when people think that when the
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.080]  government thinks that you're committing a crime you're very likely to get
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:18.480]  swat teamed Paul I played a video yesterday of George Galloway who's
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.680]  running for mayor in London and he was standing on the street in the interview
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.320]  and he had Max Kaiser next to me said a lot of people appoint Zars if I get
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:32.040]  elected as mayor I'm gonna appoint my Kaiser and the whole point was he was
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:37.920]  talking about he and Max Kaiser using blockchain as a way to audit the city of
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.640]  London pointing out that the city of London has its own special police force
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.760]  right there where you are just like the Vatican has its own Swiss guards anything
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.840]  the city of London has its own police force yet nobody ever goes to jail in
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.480]  spite of that or I should say maybe because of that but I thought it was a
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.240]  very interesting idea that we're talking about using blockchain which is a
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.440]  technology that it is at the heart of Bitcoin they're talking about using that
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.280]  to give us transparency into what the bankers are doing into what the
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.960]  government is doing into what happens with elections we've seen a lot of
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.000]  articles in the last week or so talking about blockchain doing just that and
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.160]  today Paul there was an article that Nasdaq which is the technology stock
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.720]  exchange predominantly here in the United States they handle you know we
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.560]  have certain we have several different stock exchanges some of them are focused
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.480]  on commodities some of them are focused on the financial aspects or other
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.120]  businesses but Nasdaq has a lot of tech companies and so they're the first ones
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.880]  to do this they it was reported several months ago they were looking at using
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:43.280]  blockchain within their business model to make this more reliable more
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.120]  transparent and now they have announced that they are going to be the first major
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.960]  exchange operator to use the technology behind Bitcoin so Paul do you think
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:57.000]  George Galloway and Max Kaiser on to something there in London well I mean a
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.960]  lot of people have concerns about Bitcoin because they think it's going to
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.720]  herald the cashless society yes the thing with blockchain is it creates that
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:09.640]  ledger whereby you can go back and trace every single financial transaction
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.480]  whether they're going to allow that to be applied to things like you know high
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.520]  frequency trading which is how a lot of this is done behind the scenes that
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.400]  remains to be seen I mean I think it would be very unlikely what we've seen
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:25.600]  with Bitcoin over the past couple of years is you know it started off as an
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.720]  underground movement adopted by libertarians people with privacy
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.560]  concerns now you've got a lot of the big banks especially in London because
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.480]  I've spoken to the Bitcoin entrepreneurs that actually go and meet with them on
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.640]  their massive yachts they want to co-opt that George Osborne the chancellor of the
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:50.360]  Exchequer wants all that to be regulated so they're prepared to let it exist but
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.960]  under the purview of their watchful eye which of course completely defeats the
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.040]  original objective of Bitcoin which was to be to provide complete anonymity and
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:04.560]  financial freedom so whether you can strong that strong arm that into a
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.200]  system of regulation controlled by governments and banks remains to be
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.720]  seen yeah well what they're talking about doing and of course I share your
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.600]  concerns too about about some aspects of Bitcoin I don't fully understand it I
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.560]  don't fully understand blockchain but of course as you mentioned blockchain is
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.160]  the technology at the core of not just Bitcoin but of all the crypto currencies
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.720]  it's a way of providing an audit trail that is at the same time provides some
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.600]  anonymity but also provides transparency and that's why people are looking at it
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:41.880]  as a means of trying to audit for example elections where we could look to see
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.640]  how votes were cast or have have some better way to audit the voting trail
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.880]  rather than counting hanging chads and that kind of nonsense I have concerns
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.080]  about electronic voting as well because there's other areas there's so many
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.440]  different areas where they can come in and they can game the system I
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.080]  understand all of that and I'm not advocating that for for people who's
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.920]  gonna write letters to us frankly I would rather see a paper trail even with
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.440]  the hanging chads and everything else I'd like to keep it secret above board
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.040]  and keep all that stuff together but then of course you still have the custody
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.240]  issues the counting issues the auditing issues and you can still stuff a paper
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.640]  ballot nevertheless they're looking at this Bitcoin thing and and the the
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.640]  blockchain that is a heart of all these crypto currencies it's interesting to see
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:32.960]  people talking about using it as a means to give us transparency in a lot of
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:37.360]  places where we know there's a lot of skullduggery going on like Wall Street
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.480]  like the city of London to open that up to some transparency I'd like to talk
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.200]  to people who are knowledgeable about this and and let them make their case
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.640]  work because I quite frankly don't understand it but I think it's an
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.480]  interesting idea and the other thing is you know talking about cashless
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:58.560]  societies we've got people within top finance ministries in Germany and
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.960]  places like that openly calling for a cashless society for people to have
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.720]  government-controlled bank accounts where they have to get permission from
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:11.800]  the government simply to withdraw money if you think about that to its logical
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:16.840]  conclusion a cashless society people put if there's one issue which people would
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:21.320]  completely revolt against that's it because it would create complete chaos
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.360]  especially in its early stages yeah so if you've got nothing to replace it with
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.600]  yes it could cause bedlam and that's what people's concerns are about Bitcoin
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.920]  and some of these crypto currencies is the fact that it conditions people to a
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:40.040]  cashless society and of course even if you don't have a hacking situation for
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.880]  your you know that can be stolen just like the cash can be stolen out of your
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:49.480]  mattress or or stolen out of your account by an unscrupulous broker you
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.600]  can be stolen from in any number of ways but still the fact that everything
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.840]  would be there electronically allows them so much control of your life and
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.680]  that's what they're seeking in every one of these aspects it's just like we're
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.880]  talking about earlier in the show the dangers of driverless cars are not just
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.960]  the imminent danger that the thing may malfunction and drive you into a ditch
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:15.120]  the greater danger is the control that it gives a few people over your life in
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.640]  terms of where you can go places and do things and that certainly is true of a
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:25.680]  cashless society yeah and you mentioned the Google car and that's we talked about
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:29.640]  it briefly yesterday the main ethical concern of course is if you're driving
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:34.280]  down the road and there are two choices you can have an accident erect save
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:39.240]  yourself or kill a child who's playing on the road and the AI is gonna come in
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:44.040]  and make that decision to kill you save the child so that's a whole ethical
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:48.540]  consideration surrounding AI that people really need to debate and sound out
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:54.200]  before we get those before we get that technology implemented so yeah we're
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.480]  talking about a cashless society when we talk about driverless cars we're
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:03.880]  talking about a society where liberty has really been removed where you are
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.880]  being constantly monitored constantly controlled both of those are controlling
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:12.560]  technologies and I agree with you it's not clear to me when we look at Bitcoin
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.560]  whether that's going to be something that is going to certainly it is a way
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.880]  to get around the central planning and the central banks that's a good thing
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.640]  but is it going to it's got negative aspects in terms of the cashless
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:26.320]  society in terms of being able to lose all your money if it's a grid down
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.840]  scenario if they take down the internet if they see is physically sees the
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:35.760]  servers of key nodes and take down the internet I wouldn't put that beyond
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.840]  their capability to do that we're gonna go to break Paul and we're gonna come

[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:26.320]  Jones here reporting live from London England via landline telephone Paul
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.720]  Joseph Watson via video Skype with Rob do we're both working on different
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.920]  stories right now that tie into the same overall theme and I'm going to be
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:37.880]  breaking some issues down this short segment next we're going to come back
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.160]  have a wider discussion with David Knight there in the infowars news center in
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.200]  Austin Texas and also with Paul Watson who I'll be meeting up with more tonight
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:52.360]  to compare notes and by tomorrow we're going to have several taped reports TV
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.200]  reports that we're working on today big news information on attacks on free
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:03.000]  speech across the world but also how the city of London within London is a
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.800]  globalist parasitic organization running the major narcotics trafficking all
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:12.480]  of it that's even been coming out in the news and so big reports start rolling in
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:19.960]  tomorrow Wednesday the 29th of July 2015 this of course is Tuesday the 28th of
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:25.240]  July 2015 and then we're going to be in Spain then we're going to be in Italy
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.600]  and we're going to be even closer to the meltdown sites but I want to go to
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:35.040]  Spain and then I want to go to Italy because I believe those are the next
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:40.200]  dominoes to be artificially flipped in this meltdown just look at the
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:46.040]  headlines here today in the Financial Times of London renewed stock storm
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:56.720]  deals blow to Beijing after action to halt route 1,700 shares fall by 10% as
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:02.800]  startled bidders retreat banking commodity sectors hit the second largest
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.480]  drop in Chinese stock market history we just had one three weeks ago now we've
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.320]  had another there is no way the state-run system based on fraud can
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.640]  continue and the globalists know that they use the easy money they use the
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.160]  liquidity they use the power on the way up to consolidate control then on the way
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.720]  down they'll call for global banker bailouts to then stabilize the system
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.880]  holding us hostage just as we just witnessed with the EU last week
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:38.440]  Hollanda and then and all of them coming out Merkel and Cameron coming out and
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.000]  saying yes the answer is basically strengthen the EU get rid of what
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.960]  national sovereignty is left and that will supposedly stabilize something
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:54.000]  designed to implode and then to be picked up by a larger corporate global
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.840]  government I've got a lot of points I'm going to be putting out in the next few
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.400]  days in video reports you HD on the ground talking to the people because I
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.000]  wanted to get out there and get human intelligence on the ground and to see
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.760]  what's happening from the UK right through to the heart of Europe and we're
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.600]  also going to be sending our reporters more and more during these meltdowns
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.080]  that we're going to see happen in the cascade in the coming months to get
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.880]  people boots on the ground I witness a view of actually what's happening but
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:30.760]  before we go to break and come back and get more into this and and talk to David
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:36.960]  Knight and Paul Watson about it I wanted to talk about USA today the UK version
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.960]  they have and I wanted to talk about some of the other publications here that
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:45.320]  I've been reading when you watch television whether it's sky which is
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:50.400]  Rupert Murdoch run or whether it's BBC this government run it is a Obama
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.600]  worship fest you would think this man walks on water and they run these
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.960]  headlines just like in the US they're totally deceptive US say today
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:06.560]  Obama to press Ethiopia on terror war saying they're not tough enough on
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.320]  radical Muslim extremist here's another headline of the same publication
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:16.320]  Obama addresses human rights ethnic divisions on final day in Kenya and so
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:24.000]  he's he's telling Kenyans you know marry your sons off to other men but be nice
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.840]  to the Muslims who are blowing up people and shooting up shopping malls but
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.640]  then separately he's saying Ethiopia isn't doing enough on their terror war
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.800]  here's the bottom line the West is funding radical jihad he's all over the
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.800]  Middle East all over Africa to destabilize and as we said in the
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.800]  Obama deception six and a half years ago he would then basically be the
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:50.920]  African face for the invasion and destabilization of Africa that's what I
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.840]  said it's what our experts in the film said the film's free online it's
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:59.040]  evergreen it's more important than when we first made it send the link out the
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.280]  friends and family so they can understand hey these guys predicted this
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:07.080]  all before it happens so thoroughly disgusting that he has his cousin and
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:12.120]  others Muslim leaders destabilize members families Muslim in Kenya
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:19.400]  destabilizing Kenya with the Muslim minority attacking Christians just
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.840]  like they'll use black against white or white against black here because it's
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:27.840]  a racial division they can exacerbate in Africa it's religious manipulation
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:31.440]  we're gonna come back and break this down bottom line world government here
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.080]  and it's a good about to get a lot worse but we can stand up against it we've
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.200]  got some solutions stay with us
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:56.600]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:03.000]  a third video of Planned Parenthood has been released where a whistleblower
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.520]  reveals it's basically a huge trafficking of fetal tissues the video
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:11.800]  features whistleblower Holly O'Donnell who claims that a biomedical company she
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.720]  was working for was in the business of paying Planned Parenthood clinics for
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:20.160]  fetal organs according to the condition of the tissues after being extracted
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.200]  from an abortion O'Donnell a former technician for California based
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.920]  Stern Express says the more valuable the tissue the more money you get so if you
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:33.000]  can somehow procure a brain or heart you're going to get more money than just
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.640]  umbilical cord so I guess that's incentive to try to get the hard stuff
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:41.680]  because they get more money she added in the documentary style footage and as we
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:46.280]  reported last week Planned Parenthood is engaging in desperate damage control
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:51.040]  preemptively notifying Congress that it believed that undercover journalist had
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:55.600]  footage of clinics harvesting fetal organs you can find more reports on

[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:34.920]  we've seen what happened in greece who's next is it going to be spain is it going
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:38.840]  to be italy well alex jones is there now we're also going to be talking to paul
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.760]  joseph wasan they're both in london at this moment and alex has some breaking
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:47.640]  news for us alex that's right paul wasan is working on big stories with the
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.720]  financial meltdown attacks on free speech with their banning criticism of
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:55.640]  radical muslims on the ground in london his work was so important we had one
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.600]  camera guy i had them peel off this morning
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.120]  as soon as rob do got here from the u.s he came two days after me
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:05.800]  uh to go out and start investigating those reports will be up
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.040]  in the morning by showtime 11 a.m central tomorrow
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:15.720]  then we're going to be into the continent of europe but the breaking news is this
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:22.200]  pulling back there was a story at info wars dot com last night and today by
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.680]  mckayl felon who was able to speak to the leader of the hacker group
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:31.080]  that was able to get into planned parenthood separate from the groups that
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.360]  have been getting into where they're vivisecting the babies
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:38.760]  where they're uh as sanguiating them or moving the organs
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.440]  for sale not the same group that you know got them talking about
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:46.200]  lamborghini's they want to buy and how they want to get top dollar
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.840]  you know for the baby parts and all the rest of it or how they want to get a good
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.320]  deal on them be able to sell them for higher dollar
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:54.920]  no this is hackers getting into their servers
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.680]  to then illustrate that no it's about making hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:03.400]  a year on the sale of baby parts i knew about this 15 years ago or more and i
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.880]  would talk about it on air and people just couldn't believe me
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:09.480]  i knew about mobile execution vans in china 20 years ago
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:13.160]  and people wouldn't believe me until it was in mainstream news a few years ago
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:18.280]  so the average person just cannot believe that their neighbor has 25 dead bodies
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:21.640]  buried in their basement uh or you know five people in the refrigerator like
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.240]  jeffrey dommer until it comes out and that's what's happening with this
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:29.160]  tyranny but the big breaking news is just this
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:32.360]  for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:35.880]  and i put a tweet out this morning at rel alex jones simply saying
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:41.000]  uh you know this hacker is a person after my own heart or somebody i'd like to
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.040]  you know basically hang around with uh because you hack babies we hack you the
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.600]  globalist know though that when they put the
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:51.240]  screws to humanity humanity is going to stand up
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:54.120]  that's why they want totalitarianism to try to control us
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.960]  it's never worked it's not going to work now and they're going to be hoisted on
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:02.120]  their own petard they're going to fall the pit that they've dug for us
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.880]  and all of these digital panopticon surveillance grids
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.800]  that they've put in place to surveil us are simply back doors
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.280]  for the liberty movement to go in against them and we're we're going to see the
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:17.480]  fall of plant parenthood if we want to see it
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:20.520]  you know god gives us free will and gives us our destiny yes darkness is
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.680]  growing yes we're going under world government
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.680]  because we laid down and let it happen if we stand up we at least no more
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.200]  innocence will be saved no matter what happens in the final equation
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:35.080]  it's the fact that we do the right thing on this journey is the real judgment
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.680]  that's taking place but they just need to understand this new
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.640]  video is coming out they've already admitted new
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.600]  videos coming out of them basically dissecting the babies
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.240]  they know more videos coming out of them making money
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.000]  they know that good people know the system has been taken over
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.760]  and are now going to take matters into their own hands and real patriots are
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:58.280]  smart real patriots don't blow stuff up so we
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:01.880]  can get the blame for it real patriots going with hidden cameras
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:05.880]  they hack systems they resist peacefully in the info war
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.440]  but if the globalists want to push it and get offensive and start arresting
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:14.200]  or killing patriots they'll find out how good patriots are at fighting
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:17.880]  and they'll find out our restraint has only been because
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:21.800]  we understand they want to have a physical war and we're beginning to win
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:25.320]  the info war but i wanted to salute mckell failen
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:29.320]  but i mainly want to salute and of course mckell would say this as well
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:34.200]  uh this hacker group with the fence of the unborn the defense of human life
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:37.880]  is what it's all about and and i love what the hacker said the white hat
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.400]  hacker the halo hacker i want to coin that term the halo hackers
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:45.000]  the halo hackers said listen we only do this to people that are
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.160]  arrogant not a control and delusional who need to be brought back down to earth
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:52.760]  and that's what i say to the new world order you will destroy the planet
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.720]  you will destroy yourselves napoleon hitler all of them became delusional
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:01.560]  you you you you cannot be god you are not going to win
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:06.280]  come back to earth come back to earth stop starting wars with russia
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:10.280]  stop funding radical islam and the thinking we're so dumb we don't know
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:13.160]  that you're turning it loose to destabilize things
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:16.520]  and and kill christians and non-radical muslims and and and innocence
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:19.800]  everywhere with obama giving speeches to
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.760]  african countries about doing more to fight islamic terror
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:27.160]  that means let globalist military in to counter the terrorist
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.880]  they brought in i mean this is so obvious so again the good news is
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:35.160]  and i talked about this some yesterday from a hilltop over avery
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:40.280]  i walked into this pub the only place to get food in the middle of nowhere
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:43.000]  with the biggest stone circle in the world around it
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.280]  neolithic 6000 years old there's 15 people in there i counted them
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:52.280]  and like five or six of them were listeners then i walk outside
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.960]  and i'm walking by a house and locals were listeners then i ran into guys from
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:59.720]  wales who were listeners then i announced i was there
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:06.920]  and in the 20 minutes after i did that i walked back in a a fellow named charles
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:10.200]  who's actually in the new star wars movie he was showing me stuff
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.760]  he's a stormtrooper in it they shot it here in england
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:15.880]  uh... he was a nearby town and drove over to mean us
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.680]  i'm not bragging about our show i want to be clear
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:22.440]  people who aren't well known whose faces aren't known whose voices aren't known
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.120]  but our patriots who love freedom just patriots to god patriots to common
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.200]  sense patriots to to the innocence patriots to justice
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.720]  patriots to god when when you're out there you don't know
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.640]  that other people like you are everywhere but but when i go out in public
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:43.480]  because i am known it's a radar ping to let us know
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.160]  how incredibly awake people are and i can go anywhere in the world
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:51.320]  from fishing villages uh... in central america
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:55.960]  like roatan uh... to to the middle of nowhere
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.160]  uh... south of london you know eighty miles south of london
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.000]  it is incredible it is exciting so all this other stuff is happening
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.480]  so i want to say this and go to you and watch it for some comments in this
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:07.240]  segment i'm gonna punch out till tomorrow
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:10.680]  i'm gonna be doing lengthy skype reports tape reports i'll be on the show a lot
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.400]  more coming in the next few days but david everybody are just doing an
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:16.600]  amazing job and this whole lineup of guests but it's such a
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:21.960]  exciting time to be alive we are down to earth as as just decent
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.480]  people that just love justice you just you know we just love common sense we
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:30.120]  just love order we love freedom we love free will
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:35.160]  we're down to earth the globalist think they're god so they've taken over
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.480]  so we need to be down to earth but also above it all and realizing what a joke
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:43.640]  the globalist are they're the opposite they're not down to earth
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:47.720]  they're incredibly ignorant in their own world so that's basically my take on
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:50.840]  that i know paul's got breaking news you've got breaking news
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:54.440]  so much is happening but this is just devastating victories
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:58.440]  to show how these ghouls at plan parenthood are literally being destroyed
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:02.840]  right in front of us i can feel their their their political annihilation
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:05.800]  right now the fact that they're not providing women birth control
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.800]  they're not providing women medical care they're providing evil and anti human
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.120]  wickedness with these companies raising money
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:15.880]  with with their victory campaign for plan parenthood
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:21.560]  with chunks simulated chunks of baby uh strawberries in in in
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.480]  in vanilla and women wearing shirts i had an abortion
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:29.080]  you learn they're into the occult and and and these people crawling out from
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.840]  under things screaming i love satan and spitting and frothing
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:36.040]  this is a spiritual dimensional battle that we're facing
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.760]  and we're not going to find the solution these controlled churches we're
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:42.120]  going to find in our hearts and minds with a connection to god and the universe
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:46.520]  and i can feel as evil rises i can feel good rising up to meet it
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:49.720]  it is an epic moment paul watch that i want your take on that then i want
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.320]  david's take on it but i'm telling you i can feel the energy watch this how
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.280]  exciting is it how i mean i know i i know you get
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:00.120]  recognized a lot now in the uk as well our reporters do that shows there's an
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:03.880]  awakening taking place oh like so i mean i i got
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:07.720]  recognized in austin when i went over the last year by you know literally every
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:11.400]  uber rider driver that i got in they recognize me
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:14.440]  here in london we were walking down the street just on the way to film these
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:18.120]  reports and a cabbie called us over and said hey and he had a
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:22.440]  an info wars sticker in his taxi we had a conversation with him and got it on
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:26.120]  camera as well just doing this live show right now we've had
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:29.560]  people walking past coming up to us and recognizing us so
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:33.000]  no the internet the enemy is not going to tell us that we have strength
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.960]  they're not going to tell us there's good in the world there is good the
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:40.920]  goodness is great evil is weak i'm sorry i just have to rant
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:45.240]  oh it's it's important to emphasize that people are out here and they're aware
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:48.520]  physically because the internet is a kind of a vacuum where you don't really
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:52.280]  know how much of an impact you're having obviously you can go by
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.680]  traffic stats and video views but to actually see it in person and to meet
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:00.200]  people who are engaged and aware is really a great
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:04.520]  philip is a great boost for what we're all brothers and sisters at a spiritual
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:08.280]  level together that is a communion a kinship that is beyond
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:11.640]  anything the new order can offer money power sex
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:15.080]  none of it compares to the fact that we're all brothers and sisters together
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:19.320]  in this great fight oh exactly and you know
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:23.160]  what gives me great enthusiasm and a great sense of accomplishment
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:26.760]  is getting those big stories out that reach a lot of people and really
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:29.400]  touching them at the base of you know the understanding of
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.760]  liberty and human freedom that we're trying to promote doesn't it feel good
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:37.000]  to just strike at the heart of this evil and to see the evil being defeated
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.120]  then we only wish other people would realize the power they have
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.360]  paul i want you to come back and comment on that before you leave in three
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.080]  minutes some of the handover to david but david your comment on what he was just
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:47.720]  saying yeah that's very true alex uh you know we're
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:50.840]  going to have um in the next hour we're going to be talking to abbey
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:56.120]  johnson who was a planned parenthood employee of the uh year in 2009 she
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.200]  became a whistleblower i want to get her story we're also going to talk to her
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:05.000]  about this latest planned parenthood video but yeah it is true i mean we
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.040]  it's it's something that i think it's very interesting when you said that you
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:12.520]  had a uh a stormtrooper come up to you somebody playing a stormtrooper in the
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:16.200]  the star wars home in reality he was somebody who loved liberty
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:20.360]  and that's the great hope is that uh even though we see people that we
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.440]  might not really recognize as being liberty supporters that in reality
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.760]  uh they their heart beats in the same way that ours does
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:31.960]  well absolutely of course he was like this big six foot three guy you know in
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:35.000]  good shape and he said no that's what all the stormtroopers were and he even
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.400]  off-recorded me a little bit of the inside intel
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.600]  about the new movie coming out but all that's a side issue it's just it was a
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:44.520]  funny little factoid and he was you know showing us stuff online and things about
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.560]  it coming out that was his little factoid about how they shot a bunch of it
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:50.840]  uh in london but he lives out in the countryside and is a full-time extra
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.960]  just very very exciting uh paul watson uh the accelerated financial collapse
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:59.160]  uh being here on the ground in europe you can really feel it people say
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:02.920]  that the economy is a lot tougher than it used to be
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:06.680]  well yeah that's the case i mean i was in italy about 18 months ago and you
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:09.640]  could see just by the general state of the country
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.560]  that it was starting to slip into decay i guess in greece which
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:17.560]  you may be visiting later this week you know that's going to be more apparent
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:20.600]  but i mean going back to what you were saying before i think it was rob that
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.600]  asked the cabbie you know what value have you got from the information on
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:28.440]  info wars dot com and he's like well it's it stopped me getting into debt
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  so even from like a selfish perspective just having the awareness of how the
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:36.040]  financial system works when the next economic collapse is going to happen
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.280]  where the dollar's going to go where gold's going to go
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:41.720]  you can even use that selfishly to your own benefit which i know i've done that
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.080]  in the past and you know that's a good thing for people to take better care
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.200]  of their families so well that's a great point the globalists offer
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:51.800]  ignorance and failure that's why major corporations and governments
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.720]  it's come out listen to this show it's not that mainstream media couldn't tell
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:58.120]  the truth they know what's going on they lie
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:01.240]  we have the experts we have the people on with the track record
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:04.760]  like mr dent you know last year saying watch china meltdown at the end of
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.920]  next year and it doesn't mean we have all the answers we're not even heroes
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.800]  but we instinctively don't want to be slaves
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:16.520]  we instinctively have a fighting spirit we instinctively will not submit to
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:21.000]  charity and we know we can win i've been on this field for 20 years folks
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.680]  ron paul for 40 others even longer i'm telling you
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:27.960]  i'm telling you it doesn't have to go this way and the reason i've got so much
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:31.400]  earnest in my voice is i say we're doing good and we are
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:34.280]  doing good but it's only because we're doing so bad
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.800]  that people are finally waking up the pope has announced world government
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:41.000]  they've got carbon taxes coming in to shut down the economy
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.120]  it'll kill over a billion people in the third world
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:48.840]  and then that will flood the third world even more
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:53.000]  into the the west to collapse us the globalists are
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.600]  devilish they are so evil they are committed to destruction
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:59.960]  and we've got to just grow up and admit that to ourselves and i want to thank
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.160]  all the listeners and the amazing crew back in austin texas
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.600]  that's like our our our nasa command base our houston
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.480]  you know the info wars houston is based in austin texas
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:12.280]  and they're there making sure everything happens so they're the real
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:15.720]  they're the real nuts and bolts the real heroes on the ground
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.080]  for everybody from cj to nico to just the to joe
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:22.040]  to just everybody in there to matt to just everybody i don't know if people
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:25.720]  want to be thanked on air but but this is an epic thing that's happening
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:29.000]  and we couldn't do it without you the info warriors and your prayers and
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  spreading the word and your support but it's really reaching critical mass so
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.240]  i asked folks have you told somebody about info wars dot com today
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:40.920]  have you told about other venues and other groups that are telling the truth
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:44.040]  i'm going to let paul watson and david night have final comments
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:48.120]  towards the end of the segment but the big reportage from the continent of europe
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:51.240]  i've just been taking a couple breaths the last few days getting geared up for
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.520]  this starts tomorrow right through for the next
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:58.680]  week and a half so i'm alex jones signing off for info wars dot com
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:03.240]  because if you're out there listening you are the resistance i salute you all
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.760]  all right thank you alex and you know when you're talking uh to paul when
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:10.680]  you're talking about all the different uh taxi drivers that recognize you i think
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.960]  it's very interesting i think maybe perhaps they're awake because
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:17.480]  more than anyone i think they may be seeing this new kind of corporatism
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.840]  that's coming in as they face uber you know
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.080]  taxis have been very highly connected with government very highly licensed we've
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:28.280]  seen a lot of corruption in many different countries with the
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:31.640]  taxi unions and that's what they nevertheless
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:35.240]  i see a lot of people who have sided with uber who are typically supporting
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:39.000]  the free market uber is not a jitney taxi company
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.840]  the jitney taxi companies were minority companies here in the united states paul
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:46.280]  that uh were going into areas that the regular taxi
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.120]  companies wouldn't go into they didn't want to even go there was too dangerous
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:53.960]  so you had a lot of small entrepreneurs who did it they were ruthlessly stopped
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:58.680]  by the big taxi companies the big unions and government now however
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:02.600]  we see government partnering with uber which wants to take over
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.280]  all transportation who wants to own all cars worldwide i think that's why they
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:10.440]  call themselves uber he says private ownership of vehicles is going to go
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:14.440]  away when he gets self-driving taxi cabs and we see all these articles
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:17.880]  being put out in the mainstream press about how
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:21.720]  self-driving taxis are somehow going to be the solution or a solution
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.000]  to global warming so you've got these people who have and especially in
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.960]  london they've done so much work to get the knowledge and that sort of thing
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:33.560]  and it's it's it's kind of this corporate crony capitalism where they're
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:37.720]  giving uber a different set of rules than they give these
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:41.880]  other people what are your comments it's very much
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.720]  monopoly capitalism with uber i mean in america i believe you've got
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:48.920]  maybe a couple of other similar companies lift is one of them
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:52.360]  here in london in the united kingdoms that there's really no other known
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:56.360]  companies and of course the the result of that is the service becomes poorer and
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:58.600]  poorer and the cabbie we spoke to earlier
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:02.920]  obviously hated uber as most of the black cab drivers do but i'd noted that
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:06.680]  definitely in london the uber service is very poor they don't know where they
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:10.520]  go in they overcharge you and that's because they've got no real competition
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.440]  to keep that service up to a decent standard so as long as that continues
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.880]  to be the case and government gets involved and it becomes monopoly
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:21.080]  capitalism then that situation is going to get worse so we need more
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:24.600]  competition for uber you know paul we began by talking about how
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:28.280]  creepy it was that the bank contacted this person saying that we know that you
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:31.080]  went to this this physical location certain times
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.480]  uber was keeping what they called rides of glory they actually blogged about it
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.800]  they looked at people that were making a trip that they thought was an overnight
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.160]  affair uh they they kept records of people who would
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:47.080]  go to a location and then leave at three o'clock in the morning and go back to
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.680]  where they caught the tab saying uh taxi saying that that was possibly an
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:55.480]  affair they actually mapped it out by holidays by regional areas
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:58.920]  incredibly creepy surveillance and that's what you get from
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:03.080]  coming to china for you was the bulletproof armor plates while our u.s
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:06.280]  politicians argue from banning americans from owning body armor

[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:16.840]  welcome back to the alex jones we've been talking to alex jones and paul
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:20.040]  joseph watson in london we're going to go back to paul joseph watson in just a
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.680]  moment before we do i want to let you know that this
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:26.120]  hour the alex jones show was brought to you by the products that we sell at
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:29.240]  info wars life dot com that's how we fund the organization
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:32.280]  and by our newest sleep support formulation
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.440]  knockout you know i was just uh my wife showed me this article
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.200]  that quoted that for those of you who are having trouble sleeping
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:43.320]  researchers say that one week of camping without electronics
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:48.120]  resets our biological body clock and synchronizes our melatonin hormones
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:51.560]  with the sunrise and the sunset now that's great
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:55.960]  i'd love to do that i don't have the time to do that however and
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:00.360]  as my wife pointed out should rather not have the bugs and mosquitoes should
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:03.720]  rather take knockout because knockout uses sleep
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:07.000]  supporting ingredients like melatonin talking about resetting your
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.920]  natural melatonin that's the substance that your body releases that times that's
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:15.960]  why young children can sleep so soundly and it's also why older people
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:19.880]  don't sleep very soundly they just take cat naps you know grandpa's always
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.600]  falling asleep on the uh sofa and you gotta keep waking him up but he
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.680]  doesn't sleep through the night because as you age your body's production
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:29.960]  melatonin goes down so knockout has melatonin but it has a lot of other
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:33.880]  things as well valerian root l tryptophan and other
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:37.800]  ingredients to naturally help you to get the sleep easier you know many people
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:41.640]  use melatonin we're talking about alex being in europe many people use
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:45.160]  melatonin to reset their body clock when they
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:48.520]  suffer from jet lag going to another time zone
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.360]  you'll find that l tryptophan and valerian root and many other ingredients
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:55.800]  and our newest sleep formulation from info wars life dot com

[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:17.240]  paul joseph watson in the uk of course uh paul you haven't been traveling alex
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.120]  has we were just talking to him and he's going to be following
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:24.280]  more reports this week as he's going through europe you had an article that
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:28.040]  we had not discussed yet that you want to talk about and that's the controversy
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:32.440]  surrounding a draw mohammed contest uh tell us about that
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:36.920]  yeah this was basically the story of how political dissidents who may commit
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:40.040]  thought crime and now being kidnapped off the streets of britain
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:43.800]  there was an individual who was quite prominent in the anti-islamic extremism
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.600]  movement who was going to attend a draw mohammed
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:50.120]  cartoon contest last week the police
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:54.680]  re-arrested him for a previous charge which he had already been released for
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:58.600]  in order to prevent him from attending this conference literally just so he
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:02.200]  wouldn't offend muslim so that story done a report on that outside big
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:06.200]  bend that's a massive story it's going to be up tomorrow before the show
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:10.680]  that's amazing and of course we've seen a lot of comments from david cameron
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:16.040]  hostile to free speech hostile to privacy he wants to abolish
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:20.040]  uh any kind of encryption as does the fbi here as well
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:24.120]  they don't want you to have any kind of encryption they want a backdoor into
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.760]  everything you do they've already put the backdoors in they're already listening
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:28.440]  to everything but they want to make sure
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.120]  that we don't get people don't start using encryption widely they want to
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:36.840]  make sure they can continue to get access to all of our information
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:40.440]  yeah and just one more thing on that story there was literally a guy wearing
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.440]  an ices flag walking around the streets of london three weeks ago he was
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:48.440]  briefly detained by police questioned they let him go didn't even take him
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.840]  into the station so you've got that happening then you've got
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:53.880]  people who merely plan to attend draw mohammed cartoon
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:56.760]  contest being abduct abducted off the streets
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:00.920]  so as not to offend these muslim minorities so that's the state of free
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:03.800]  speech in britain today well very much like what we saw here in the
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:07.240]  united states of course once we had that guy who was obviously
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:11.240]  had an islamic agenda a jihadist agenda shooting up
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:17.480]  not one but two military recruiting areas they did everything they could to
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:21.560]  push that away to deny that had any kind of islamic terrorist
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:24.440]  connection at the same time they went through
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:28.280]  weeks of demonizing all of southern culture
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:31.640]  and the confederate battle flag because they had a picture
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:35.560]  of a mass shooter who was reportedly on drugs
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:38.440]  it's amazing to see the dichotomy stay with us we'll be right back with paul

[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:46.920]  planned parenthood video as alex mentioned in the last segment of course
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:52.600]  michael uh fail and talk to and we have an article up at infowars.com talk to
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:55.160]  some people who said that they they have hacked
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:59.560]  planned parenthoods emails and website uh they are
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:03.000]  going to be exposing some incriminating information they say we haven't seen that
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.840]  yet let's talk about some incriminating evidence
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:10.680]  against jeb bush this is an article uh that was up on the drudge report
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:15.560]  from bloomberg politics jeb bush snares a democrat money man
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:18.840]  on a tour of the hamptons listen the way this place is described
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:24.200]  this is how the the game is played by the uh oligarchy that we have the clintons
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:28.840]  and the bushes they say behind a garden that's modeled on moneys
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:32.600]  this is a presumably modeled after a famous painting
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:37.560]  jeb bush addressed a lawn full of chief executives and hedge fund managers
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.000]  at an east hampton new york estate saturday morning that'd be out on long
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.240]  island while the candidate is no longer no stranger to courting wealthy donors
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:49.480]  this time it was different about half of the attendees were democrats
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:54.280]  this guy sells well said kenneth lipper a money manager and a registered
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:58.360]  democrat who hosted the event he said virtually the only one left
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:03.320]  without writing a check was a buck deer that wondered past the group assembled
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:07.160]  on the wooded grounds amazing and they point out
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:10.840]  that candidates are raising more money through super PACs which can accept
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:15.080]  donations up to a million dollars or more
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:20.040]  you can donate a million dollars it seems to me i remember dinesh desuza
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:26.360]  is uh got convicted of a felony because he donated 20 000 dollars to a
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:31.000]  candidate isn't that interesting and of course submitted for additional
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.520]  psychological evaluation nothing political about that is there
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:38.440]  that's how the game is played these guys write the rules they set it up so that
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:41.640]  the great big bees go through the
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:45.000]  spider's web but the small mats get trapped in it
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.680]  here's some more news about the political campaign uh lindsay graham
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:52.760]  accuses trump of appealing to the dark side of politics
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:56.680]  yeah that's right that lindsay graham the merchant of death
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:59.960]  okay the lobbyist for the military industrial complex
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:03.640]  talks about donald trump saying that he's appealing to the dark side of
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:07.640]  politics he says fellow republican presidential
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:10.360]  donald trump is appealing that dark side should be avoided
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:14.120]  he's appealing to fear and prejudice and there's a market for that yeah
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.320]  lindsay would know because lindsay has made a career
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.480]  out of appealing to fear and prejudice he knows there's a market for that he
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:25.000]  knows where he can get paid by the military industrial
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.760]  complex for creating wars for creating fear
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:32.840]  for creating this massive armament that we've got that we just talked about in
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.360]  the last hour how this is careening off of the cliff one more area that's
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:40.280]  screening off the cliff now of course uh paul rampall
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:44.040]  is uh not getting the super PAC funding he's getting most of his funding from
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:47.400]  individuals and he pointed out that trump is getting a billion
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:53.080]  dollars worth of free advertising this is on the hill uh he was on cbs's
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:55.320]  face the nation he says i think if you give a candidate
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:59.880]  about a billion dollars worth of free advertising that might help them to get
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:03.400]  their message out he's not getting that kind of free
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:06.200]  advertising and he's not getting the big bucks from the
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:09.320]  moneyed people like jud bush and hillary clinton but it's not just them of
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:14.200]  course politico reports that the coke brothers have now
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:19.960]  summoned bush crews walker and rubio to a southern california
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:23.960]  confab because those are the guys that they know they can put
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:30.040]  a purchase evidently uh so that's uh just a note to people who are considering
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:34.280]  that and of course we see verney sanders visiting louisiana he's very popular
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:38.200]  people because he seems to be planes spoken and out in the open nevertheless
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:42.600]  you don't have to scratch him too deep to see gun control agenda he wants
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:47.320]  background checks and registration here's a clue those things don't control guns
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:50.920]  we've already seen that with all of these shootings involved okay
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:55.240]  all of those techniques are for controlling people stay with us right
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:58.520]  when we come back we're going to be talking to abby johnson former planned
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:01.960]  parenthood employee days after the deal with iran was sealed
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:06.520]  secretary of defense ashton carter said the possibility of iranian aggression
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:10.680]  and the possibility that iran will not obey the agreement which is why we will
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:14.600]  keep the military option which was the alternative to a deal
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:18.840]  john carrey echoed carter's diplomatic blunder by attempting to calm the fears
[02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:22.840]  of jewish leaders at a meeting that would later be described as an intense
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:26.280]  exchange speaking at the council of foreign relations
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:30.280]  carrey claimed israel would get the blame if congress voted down the nuclear
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:33.400]  deal meanwhile british authorities were so blinded
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:36.760]  by the obama administration's one-sided nuclear deal
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:41.000]  they reduced the travel advisory warnings for nationals to iran
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:46.200]  of course as news availed threats doled out by carter and carrey hit terran in
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:49.800]  response iranian supreme leader the ayatollah ali
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:54.680]  kameini sent out a tweet depicting president obama committing suicide

[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:04.120]  quality products that we sell at info wars life dot com products like
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:09.160]  survival shield x2 nascent iodine that is now back in stock you can see we have
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:13.080]  over 400 reviews on info wars life dot com over 99
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:16.200]  percent of respondents would recommend it to a friend or family
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:19.880]  let me give you a couple of the reviews so you can get an idea of what you can
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:23.160]  see there this is uh from jason and arburn
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:27.720]  washington he says great product i felt a mild detox on day two a few days after
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:31.960]  that it really clears up the skin makes my mind sharper i've been recommending it
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:35.560]  to people i see it work i reckon i remind people it used to be in
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:40.520]  bread and salt but it was removed it's the best way to get good quality iodine
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.200]  another one from kebler and sacramento california says i've started taking
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:47.800]  survival shield x2 one week ago and after the first week i've
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:51.720]  noticed more energy and i'm not tired and groggy in the afternoon anymore i've
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:55.000]  also noticed a cleaner dealing all around
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.440]  i'm not sure what that means but he's feeling much better taking it because
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:01.960]  we all need iodine as the first commenter pointed out
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:04.840]  is something that used to be part of our food supplement we don't get that
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:08.600]  anymore it's a great and easy way to take it in liquid form
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:12.920]  we sell out of nascent iodine frequently it's available in stock and right now
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:16.840]  at info wars life dot com we have free shipping for the month of july with
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:20.200]  that's only two days left on that free shipping so you can get that you can
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:24.120]  stock up on survival shield x2 nascent iodine right now
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:28.280]  while it's in stock well now let's talk to
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.360]  abbey johnson thank you for joining us abbey let me introduce you here she left
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:36.680]  the abortion industry in 2009 it says she's known that her
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:40.040]  calling was to work with current and former abortion clinic workers you've
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:43.400]  got a website abortion worker dot com you've also got another one
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:48.840]  and then there were none at twn.org that's not an agatha christie
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:55.480]  novel that is the concern about the massive numbers of people
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:11:00.920]  that have been killed since rovey wade a number that's equivalent
[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:04.840]  really to a 9-11 on virtually a daily basis
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:08.760]  is what we've seen and so i want to ask you you were there you
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.520]  you started with plan parenthood in 2001 your bio says you
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:15.880]  progressed the position of health center director
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:19.480]  they were giving you awards there but what happened
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:23.560]  that caused you to leave so there are a couple of things that happened
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:30.200]  one was that they imposed an abortion clinic quota
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:34.840]  on all of the facilities that performed abortions so they told us you have to
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:39.640]  perform you know this many abortions every every day
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:43.160]  every month uh in order to meet your goals to
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:46.280]  receive your bonuses to keep your staff
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:49.960]  that's very trouble because if you had somebody that was just a doctor
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:52.920]  let's say that this this is a doctor that did heart surgery
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:55.400]  and they came into that doctor and they said you need to do
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:59.560]  x number of open heart surgeries right or else i mean you would expect that
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:02.200]  perhaps they're going to be doing open heart surgeries
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:05.640]  that are not necessary because it's profit driven
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:10.440]  right and abortion and and i can you know only really speak to my experience at
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.800]  plan parenthood but it was very profit driven so
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.400]  we were told at plan parenthood that we were to turn
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:23.160]  every client visit and every telephone call into a revenue generating visit
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:27.320]  the only way that you can make money off of a pregnant woman at plan parenthood
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:31.080]  is to sell her an abortion because they don't provide prenatal care
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:34.760]  they don't provide any obstetrical care and they don't help women with
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:38.520]  adoption services so the only way you can make money off of pregnant woman is to
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:43.080]  sell an abortion and so it's not surprising that 92 percent of pregnant
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:46.280]  women who enter plan parenthood will have an abortion because
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:49.960]  they are being sold a product so that was the first thing
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:54.280]  and that was concerning for me because i really believe that at plan parenthood
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:59.240]  we were there to help women that we were there to reduce the number of abortions
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.600]  that's what plan parenthood said and i had believed it for eight years so this
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:05.080]  was concerning for me it was all about planning
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:08.040]  it was all about family planning and making sure that every child
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:11.640]  is a wanted child that's right that's what i thought that's what i believed
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:18.280]  and then but ultimately i left after witnessing a live ultrasound guided
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:21.720]  abortion procedure take place on a 13 week old baby
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:26.440]  and i saw that baby fighting and struggling for his life in the womb
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:29.960]  trying to get away from the abortion instruments
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:33.960]  and i knew that i had been lied to by plan parenthood
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:37.400]  um and and because of that because i had believed that lie
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:41.000]  i had lied to thousands of women who would come through my facility and so i
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.480]  knew that i had to leave and i had to start
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:47.080]  speaking out and that's what i've done yeah i told my wife many years ago we
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:52.440]  were talking about this um personally we were in college
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:58.120]  when roe v wade came out and and so when i looked at it i was
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:01.560]  like you i i believed a lot of the rhetoric i was somebody always came to
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.240]  things from a libertarian perspective so i thought i want government out of the
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:08.200]  out of the bedroom out of the boardroom i don't want them telling me how do you
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:10.920]  how to run my life and i still feel that way
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:14.120]  i mean a lot of people think because of my position
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:18.440]  on gay marriage that i don't feel that way no i i don't care what people do i
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:21.480]  don't want to have any coercion and that's what i'm concerned about with
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:23.960]  that but with with this i thought well there's some
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:26.680]  question in my mind and there's question
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:31.000]  and other people's minds as to when life begins and so i was open to that
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:37.320]  until i ran for congress and and i got involved in some debate forms and
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:41.000]  candidate questions and people asked me about partial birth abortion which was
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.640]  happening at the time and i didn't know what they were
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:47.400]  talking about and when i went back and looked at the procedure i said this is
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:50.840]  nothing but murder i've been lied to just as as you were
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:53.640]  and i told my wife at the time it's interesting you mentioned that it was
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:55.960]  ultrasound because i told my wife at the time i said
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:59.960]  the way we're going to stop this because there's so much deception and lying
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:03.560]  going on with this i said the the best thing that anybody could do i know
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:07.400]  counseling is important but i think the organizations need to start
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:11.560]  trying to fund a way that we can get better imaging of the baby
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:15.640]  in the womb and now we have that it wasn't funded by the
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:19.800]  the pro-life people but we do have that we have 4d ultrasound and people can see
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:23.480]  movies of their children in the in the womb
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:27.000]  we see a national geographic had a special where they showed
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.640]  dolphins and dogs and elephants in the womb and now you could see the detail
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:35.080]  down to the to the hair on these on these animals and
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:39.560]  we can see that detail now with 4g ultrasound
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:43.320]  but this the things that we're seeing now the testimony of people like you
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:46.200]  who have worked there the things that we're seeing now with these videos that
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:50.040]  are coming out now on a weekly basis where they're talking about the things
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:54.040]  that you have said for a long time whistleblowers have said but to see the
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.640]  people who are the doctors who are the head of the clinics
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:01.240]  talking about how they're doing this for profit negotiating
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:07.160]  the money there it's just just amazing well and i've said before that organ
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:11.800]  harvesting is a big business uh tissue harvesting is a big business it's not
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:15.320]  just it's not just talking about fetal tissue
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:19.880]  here either i mean we're talking about uh you know companies like you knows
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:26.280]  who have millions of dollars of assets um you know people are profiting
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:30.280]  organizations are profits profiting off of
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:35.080]  the sale and harvesting of adult yes organ donors as well
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:39.480]  so you know we're not just talking about babies even though in these videos we
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:44.040]  are but i mean this is a this is a symptom of a larger problem and
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.520]  that is the exploitation of life yes period and the modification of life
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:52.120]  because we talked in this program earlier about the many articles that have
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:55.560]  come out and of course they're talking about the good things that can be done
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:58.520]  with it they're not talking about the evil things that can be done with it
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:01.480]  they're not talking about what the department of defense is planning on
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:04.120]  doing with this they're not talking about the possibility
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:07.000]  that they could make mistakes technological mistakes that could go
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.440]  horribly wrong with people uh they're not talking about people getting a
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:14.200]  hold of some of this genetic information and using it to target a
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:16.760]  particular population which is what we know that planned
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:19.800]  parenthood anybody who knows their history knows that
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:23.480]  that's what they were doing it had a very very much a eugenicist target behind
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:25.800]  it so when we look at this and we look at the
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:29.320]  fact that they're harvesting this on the front end in this unethical way
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:34.360]  it raises concern for me about how this genetic research is going to be used
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.760]  on the back end as well because it's this fetal tissue
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:43.480]  human adult tissue that they're grabbing and the same people who would resort to
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:47.320]  getting uh baby body parts for their research are the people who are going
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:50.920]  to be producing these new genetic miracle drugs we're told
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:54.520]  right and one of the things that's uh that is
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:58.840]  terrifying to me is that the abortion industry it's not just the abortion
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:02.840]  industry it is the abortion industry but it's also uh you know i read somewhere
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:07.240]  that texas tech received a three million federal grant to do embryonic
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:11.160]  uh stem cell research you know harvesting fetal tissue and organs
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:14.760]  uh you know NIH i mean all of these different groups
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:18.360]  are are collecting this tissue and doing we don't know what with it but the
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:21.880]  scary thing is that uh and and really the manipulative
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:25.720]  and i think one of the worst parts is that you know when we would talk to
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:29.240]  these women who are having an abortion uh we would
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:34.120]  you know basically manipulate them into believing that by donating this tissue
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:37.400]  they could be saving the lives of others but in reality
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:41.320]  we had no idea what that tissue was going to be used for that was never
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:44.920]  disclosed to us at the clinic it was just for a price
[02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:49.320]  so we're going to pay you two hundred dollars per specimen per baby
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.840]  and uh and and you're going to get as many as you can
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:56.040]  and then we're going to basically lie to our clients and say
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:59.800]  oh no we're we're you know this could save the lives of other people
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:02.680]  when really we have no idea what it's being used for
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:06.120]  um let's talk about that aspect of it too because we talked about how you know
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:08.360]  you don't want to you don't want to put a quota
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:12.760]  on there for cardiologist or for uh ontologist or whatever we and we've
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:16.520]  seen a recent example of a doctor who diagnosed
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:19.320]  people uh that that didn't have cancer diagnosed
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:22.120]  with cancer so he could make money off of them
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:26.280]  this is something from an organization called bitch magazine that's their name
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:29.960]  bitch magazine and they say women should have the
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:35.800]  option to donate but not to sell why would you not want women to
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:39.320]  sell it okay well the obvious question is you don't want to
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:43.640]  create an incentive of killing for profit but that's precisely
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:47.160]  what they were doing well that's what abortion is period exactly exactly
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:50.040]  stay with us when we come back we're going to continue talking to abby
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:55.000]  johnson former plant parenthood employer employee and now a whistleblower
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.120]  we're going to talk to her about what she's seen and have her analysis of this

[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:15.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight in austin joining me in
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:19.560]  studio is abby johnson abby was a is a former
[02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:23.560]  plant parenthood worker and of course um
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:27.240]  she saw some things there that were very disturbing she became a whistleblower
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:29.800]  she has a couple of websites we're going to talk to her about
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:33.480]  her websites what are there but of course abby
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:36.840]  what we were talking about just before we went to the break was
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:40.680]  why you would not want to allow the donors
[02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:45.400]  of either organs or of babies aborted babies to
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:49.720]  profit from this it's obviously because you don't want to incentivize
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:54.360]  killing you take organs from accidents from car accidents or whatever
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:59.480]  and uh so you don't want to create a a profit motive for them to kill and yet
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:03.640]  that is precisely what plant parenthood is doing you you said that when you were
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:07.000]  there one of the things that raised a lot of alarms with you in that final year
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.320]  was the fact that they were giving you quotas and telling you that you had to
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:15.480]  turn this many people so you were actively pushing for abortion
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:18.920]  not just helping people to make sure that every child is a wanted child as their
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:23.720]  slogan goes it was simply about profit right and and this is
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:27.880]  you know it would it would seem like if plant parenthood
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:31.240]  is receiving two hundred dollars per baby
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:34.680]  that they sell that they would take that two hundred dollars
[02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:38.040]  off the cost of a woman's abortion right oh no no
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:41.400]  they want to double dip they want to get money from both the abortion
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:48.520]  and the sale of her aborted baby um so you know and just just you know to give
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:52.040]  you some numbers here so plant parenthood Gulf Coast
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:56.360]  is one of that's the affiliate I worked for and they are one of the few
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.520]  plant parenthood affiliates that does participate in this fetal tissue research
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:04.920]  harvesting of organs so let's just say conservatively
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:08.920]  that they perform 50 abortions a day
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:12.440]  six days a week okay now their their quota
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.120]  is 75 abortions a day six days a week okay but
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:20.120]  we'll just be conservative and say that they perform 50 a day
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:24.280]  and I'll also give them a break on the price and say that they're only getting
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:28.920]  a hundred dollars per specimen okay now
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:31.480]  really they were getting two hundred dollars when I was there but we'll just
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:35.400]  say a hundred dollars on 50 abortions six days a week that's
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:40.520]  30 thousand dollars a week that plant parenthood is receiving
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:46.920]  on the sale of human body parts 120 thousand dollars a month
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:51.880]  and yet they are still receiving more than half a billion dollars
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:54.920]  of our taxpayer money wow and that figure you put out you
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:58.600]  you derated that by at least half yes you knock the feet down by half you knock
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:02.440]  the the number that they were doing down by a third
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:06.280]  so that's I'm absolutely amazing that's
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:10.760]  why it is so big and that's why this lady who said yeah I want my Lambeau
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:15.240]  look it is profit-based we know that absolutely she was being sarcastic
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:18.680]  about it but there is absolutely no question
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:21.640]  when you look at the vast amount of money that's being done there the way
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:25.800]  they push abortions and yet we see this story here from the AP
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:28.760]  where the plant parenthood official has come back and says
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.040]  there's no profit from fetal organs no profit whatsoever
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:35.000]  yeah here's the thing that's interesting about that so let's say they're charging
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:38.360]  a hundred dollars the only real cost for plant
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:42.360]  parenthood in all of this is shipping the specimen so
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:45.640]  let's say it's you know approximately five to ten dollars
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:48.680]  per specimen that they ship it's probably less than that but
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:52.120]  we'll give them five to ten dollars per specimen but they're collecting
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:56.840]  anywhere from a hundred to two hundred dollars maybe even more per baby
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:01.960]  that they harvest and sell so they're not just recouping their cost
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:04.600]  and it was clear in that video that they weren't doing it because she said she
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:08.040]  didn't know what the costs were no and so she's negotiating a fee but she
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:10.840]  doesn't know what her cost that's right because there are no cost except for
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:15.240]  the shipping but the law the problem is with this in
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:19.720]  particular is the law because the law allows this loophole so the law says
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:23.320]  well as long as it's for you know you write it down you mark it down for
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:27.640]  storage or transport or collection preservation whatever
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:31.400]  as long as you mark it down as encoded as that
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:36.280]  then you can charge whatever you want as long as the cost is not quote prohibitive
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:39.640]  well prohibitive is completely suggest suggestive so
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:43.960]  you know for me a mom of five that's the prohibitive cost is going to be very
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:46.360]  different than a billion dollar organization like
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:50.120]  Planned Parenthood and what I've told people all along ever since I left is
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:54.440]  that if there is a loophole in a law that involves Planned Parenthood
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:57.480]  they will find a way to blow right through that loophole and that's what
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:00.360]  they've done in this situation and she said it she said well no you know this
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:03.640]  would be against the law but you know laws are subjectively determined and
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:08.200]  that's where they and we've got Boehner John Boehner head of the GOP
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:12.680]  voters who voted for him want to not see the federal government funding this
[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:17.640]  they certainly don't want to see them profiting from the sale of babies that
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:21.880]  they have incentivized the killing of Boehner says he needs more facts
[02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:25.320]  hey send this video to John Boehner and tell him
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:27.960]  it's got the facts in there he needs to take a look at this
[02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:33.320]  there's no gray areas in this there's no gray areas in a black market for baby
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:37.480]  body parts if you can tell the difference between
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:41.320]  right and wrong John Boehner stay with us we're going to be right back with
[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:47.000]  abbey johnson we're going to take a look at the new Planned Parenthood video

[02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:56.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:02.120]  a group called concerned citizens is petitioning an iowa school district to
[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:05.560]  prevent students from attending a conference on bullying the conference
[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:09.160]  was set up by an activist group called iowa safe schools it was the content
[02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:11.880]  of the conference held in april which has parents up in arms
[02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:15.640]  among the nearly two dozen speakers only two addressed bullying the rest of the
[02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:18.760]  sessions involved issues such as how to pleasure their gay partners
[02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:22.120]  middle school girls learned how to sew fake testicles into their underwear in
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:25.960]  order to pass themselves off as boys and the featured speaker drag performer
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:29.640]  miss coco peru cursed a lot and encouraged attendees to vandalize the
[02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:33.000]  property of lgbt critics one parent summed it up like
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.920]  this it wasn't really on bullying it was basically a sex ed class for same-sex
[02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:41.160]  couples nate monson executive director of iowa safe schools said in response to
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:44.360]  the parents it's incredibly frustrating that adults are being the problem and
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:48.520]  being the bully we can do better in iowa the real plan is to sexualize your kids
[02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:52.280]  so more abortions can be performed if you want to go deeper into the rabbit hole

[02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:28.760]  studio is abby johnson a former planned parenthood worker
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:33.560]  who became a whistleblower she realized that this was being done for
[02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:38.360]  profit as they pushed and gave them quotas uh continued to push for this she
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:41.560]  realized that this was not about helping people to make
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:45.480]  planning choices it was about pushing abortions and then she saw
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:51.640]  an ultrasound saw a baby recoiling in pain when they told her that the baby
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:57.320]  could not feel pain at that age or was it 11 weeks abby 13 13 weeks okay
[02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:01.480]  uh that was that was it for her and so now she has a couple of websites we
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:04.280]  didn't talk about those websites uh tell us briefly about that it's abortion

[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:13.240]  can also get there if attwn.org and then there were none is the
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:16.840]  acronym for that but abortion worker dot com will also take you there what can
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:20.520]  they find there abby uh this is a ministry and organization that
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:23.960]  specifically reaches out to abortion clinic workers to try to get them out
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:28.440]  of the clinic to try to get them on a path of healing to get them other
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:32.920]  employment that does not destroy life but preserves it uh so far in the past
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:36.600]  three years we've had 174 clinic workers leave
[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.040]  and come into the pro-life movement and that includes six
[02:34:40.040 --> 02:34:44.600]  uh former abortionist who permanently laid down their instruments are now
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:46.680]  fighting to defend life instead of destroy it.
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:50.840]  That's great that's really great. Now let's talk to
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:54.360]  John Boehner. John Boehner who says there's not enough facts out of these
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:58.760]  videos to make a decision. John Boehner who can get all emotional
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:02.920]  and choked up and cry at a golf channel interview but he can't
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:07.240]  get worked up about what we're going to see in this third video.
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:11.480]  Let's go to the law John Boehner that's your responsibility 42
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:15.560]  us code 289 g-2 prohibitions regarding human fetal tissue
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:20.040]  here's what it says John it says purchase of tissue shall be unlawful for
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:23.720]  any person to knowingly acquire receive or otherwise transfer any human
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:28.440]  human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:32.920]  interstate commerce. Now they determine they have exceptions to
[02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:36.280]  valuable consideration they say that doesn't include reasonable payments
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:40.520]  associated with transportation, implantation,
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:45.240]  processing, preservation, quality control or storage
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:48.920]  so they give themselves some wiggle room here they create
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:52.520]  an opening which Planned Parenthood tries to exploit
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:56.120]  but let's look at video number two's confession
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:00.440]  and here's the transcript this is the one remember this is the Lambo doctor
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:04.200]  at one point and this is a quote from the video she says
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:07.960]  and the mechanics of it was that Heather a Novogenics person would come to the
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:11.320]  site and our staff would sign the patients up and get their consent
[02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:14.360]  then Heather would look at the tissue and she would get
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:18.840]  and get what she required so logistically it was very easy for us
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:23.720]  we didn't have to do anything we did not have to do
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:28.920]  anything hear that so there was compensation for this
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:32.680]  so she came to the site she picked out what she wanted
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:35.960]  she took it with her there's no transportation involved there
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:40.120]  they did not have to do anything but there was compensation involved
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:42.760]  and there was a discussion as I was leaving so they've been paying by the
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:45.400]  case and there was some discussion about doing it in a different way
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:48.840]  I don't know what you're used to doing now you're used to doing compensation
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:52.280]  patients don't get anything of course all right now
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.040]  let's talk about this again remember the exception of valuable consideration
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:00.040]  John Boehner is transportation was there any transportation no Heather
[02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:04.120]  took the parts with her there wasn't any implantation going on
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:07.240]  there wasn't any processing by Planned Parenthood that they would get paid for
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:11.080]  because Heather would look at the tissue and take out what she desired
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:15.400]  okay there was no preservation of the tissue she's taking it right then
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:19.160]  there's no quality control or storage she's taking the stuff right then so
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:23.880]  John why don't you investigate this why don't you do something about it
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:27.880]  instead we've got the leadership of the republican party shutting down
[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:31.880]  Rand Paul shutting down Mike Lee when they tried to defund Planned Parenthood
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:36.600]  and it's not just John Boehner it's also Mitch McConnell
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:39.720]  Mitch McConnell so you've got Cruz you've got Lee
[02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:44.040]  you've got Rand Paul trying to shut down the funding of this not even talking
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:46.920]  about doing a criminal operation about this because I don't guess we can get
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:51.240]  the Department of Justice and Obama administration to go after somebody for
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:54.120]  murdering babies and selling them off wholesale
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:58.200]  taking specific orders as we heard the first video she's
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:01.720]  basically letting saying well you can order it a la carte essentially
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:05.800]  you know you tell us what you want we'll talk to them we'll make sure that we
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:09.800]  don't crush the parts involved we'll make sure that we put it in a breach
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:13.800]  presentation that's the hallmark of partial birth abortion which by the way
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:18.280]  is illegal but they do that so they can preserve the body parts
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:22.360]  your comment Abby yeah I mean I think that we are
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:25.720]  I'm glad that these videos are coming out I think many of us have been talking
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:29.080]  about this for years but I think it for some people it took
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:33.080]  hearing it yes from them directly that this is happening
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:37.240]  this is a process that Planned Parenthood is involved in that
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:41.560]  that other groups are also involved in hopefully it wakes people up because
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:45.480]  because really the travesty is not them selling the body parts
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:49.400]  the travesty is that a innocent human life is being killed in the first place
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:53.320]  exactly but if it takes this to wake up some Americans
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:57.640]  to really this modern-day holocaust that we're experiencing
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:00.760]  then so be it I hope this is what it takes I hope
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:03.800]  that it that this is what it takes to get people motivated to get out there and
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:06.440]  do something and well it's like it took a partial
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:09.560]  birth abortion to wake me up sure get me to pay any attention to it I never had
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:12.200]  to make that decision fortunately in my life
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:15.880]  but I was willing to let other people make this decision I'm not willing to
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:19.000]  let other people make the decision as to whether or not they want to kill babies
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.360]  right I'm not willing to do that that doesn't fall into my libertarian
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:26.600]  philosophy that you can take innocent life well you're just a bigger it does
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:30.200]  but but you know it took that it took that and of course why were they doing
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:32.680]  partial birth abortion well we know because the first video she's talking
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:36.200]  about how we present it you know in a breach birth position that way we can
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:40.200]  get to the valuable body parts without you know tearing everything apart
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:43.720]  so that was a hallmark back then 20 years ago
[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:47.960]  that you know they were they were doing this this partial birth abortion so
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:51.480]  they could preserve and sell the body parts because they wanted another
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:56.120]  profit center let's take a look at this video that was released today now
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:59.640]  let's go to this first clip and I think it's very powerful now you're not going
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:03.160]  to be able to see this if you're on radio go ahead and run that clip and
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:06.760]  we'll talk about this while it's on there when they pull this clip up they
[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:11.080]  say what do you see and they show a baby hands legs
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:15.400]  heart eyes okay and then they say what does Planned Parenthood see
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:18.520]  and they put dollar signs over all these different body parts
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:24.200]  that's a very very powerful image and then I want to go to this let's go
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:28.120]  to this next clip that we've got here guys
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:33.080]  this is uh let's go ahead and run that next clip and then I see someone come in
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:37.880]  with a bottle of something and there was blood in it like
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:40.840]  okay and then they they went over to sink and
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:45.640]  they emptied it out in a strainer and put it on the pie dish and lit it up
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:50.040]  and and I'm like looking like what's going on
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:53.560]  and my trainer comes over and she she puts on gloves
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:58.360]  and she grabs some some tweezers and she's picking
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:02.600]  parts away from the vaginal tissue and I'm
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:07.480]  I've never had anxiety before this at all so I'm looking and I don't know what's
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:09.640]  going on I had no idea this is what was going to be
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:13.560]  happening especially my first day and uh she's
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:16.920]  literally she's has tweezers and she's like okay well this is his head
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:20.280]  this is the arm this is a leg and she goes she hands him over
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:24.200]  I was like oh here you go can you show me some of the parts I just showed you
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:31.080]  and then I see someone come in with a bottle of stuff just amazing let's run
[02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:34.200]  the next one and I want to play several of these and then we're going to break
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:37.640]  down and analyze in detail what they say let's put us
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:41.080]  next clip these are intact kidneys yes so somebody
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:44.840]  needed the upper corner you can see a still of
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:48.920]  the baby parts arms legs eyes head five stars
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:53.080]  yeah I mean you can I mean you could start a neural cell culture from this
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:56.760]  from this neural tissue right here that would someone want that this
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:02.040]  yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah someone would someone would definitely
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:05.320]  really because I know that's when we talked about this is this is neural
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:08.120]  tissue that people could take and look and you see how it's still connected
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:11.320]  through this final cord back there if we just send that all together
[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:14.840]  and then you could actually yeah yeah some people
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:17.720]  some people prefer that actually because it keeps it a little more
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:21.880]  protected you know okay now he goes on to say
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:26.680]  the buyer says that 11 6 that's 11.6 week old baby
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:30.360]  was pretty good there were three or four samples we could have taken out of the
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:34.040]  11 6 and then the doctor says excellent and then the buyer says
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:38.120]  well if we were doing like 50 to 75 dollars per specimen that'd be like
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:41.960]  two to 300 total and we'd be comfortable with that but stuff like this
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:45.480]  we don't want to be like just like a flat fee of like
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:48.520]  200 dollars and then it's like and then the doctor says no
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:52.440]  and they I think a per item thing works a little better just because we can see
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:56.760]  how much we can get out of it don't tell me that they are not
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:02.120]  doing this for profit everybody can see that they are doing this for profit
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:05.800]  this is not a question of a black market
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:11.240]  versus a gray area of the law this is the difference as to whether or not
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:14.760]  our society can see the difference between right and wrong
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:18.040]  everybody comes to this from a different perspective many of us have been on the
[02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:20.600]  other side abbey johnson was on the other side she even worked for plant
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:22.920]  parenthood she thought she was helping people with
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:27.160]  birth control she thought she was helping people make decisions to really do
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:30.440]  family planning instead she realized they were pushing
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:34.680]  abortions they were pushing infanticide and then she saw that it was murder i
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:40.040]  realized that this was murder when i got educated about partial birth abortion
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:45.640]  now america america can see videos of babies in the womb
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:50.840]  with 4g ultrasound they can see living babies in the womb
[02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:56.200]  they know that this is not a non-human thing that is going through evolutionary
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:59.480]  stages as we were told by Ernst Teckler the bulldog for
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:03.560]  Charles Darwin he made up those drawings folks
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:07.640]  it's false we have pictures now he just invented all of that
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:11.000]  to push the theory of evolution and now we've been told
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.080]  that uh these are not human that at this one point they're they're just fish
[02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:18.040]  at this other point they're birds or whatever and then later on they become
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:21.080]  human but that doesn't stop them from aborting
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:25.400]  fully mature babies that's outlawed that partial birth abortion process
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:30.360]  and yet they feel that they still have a gray area
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:34.520]  know the question for america now that you have 4g ultrasound now that you
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:38.680]  have these undercover sting operations and you can see that this is being run
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:42.440]  for profit the question for america is
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:46.680]  can you tell the difference between right and wrong
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:50.680]  yeah i mean i think that that that is the bottom line that abortion has always
[02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:56.040]  been wrong that uh roe v wade was was wrong and i think
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:00.680]  it's time that we that we kind of force the government's hand we're
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:02.920]  going to have to do it by the way that we vote
[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:07.080]  we're going to have to do it by our actions um by our money
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:10.520]  and uh i mean that's what's going to make them pay attention
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:14.200]  yes is our money uh and you know i for one
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:20.680]  am sick of my tax dollars being used to fund the killing of innocent life
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:25.480]  yes and i have to say too again as we see in so many different issues i don't
[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:29.080]  know what your opinions are on this abby but my opinions are on this that
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:33.320]  washington is just too far gone we can have somebody like john bainer who says
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:35.800]  that he doesn't have any facts he's got the facts
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:39.320]  he doesn't care about this he can get all sentimental about his golf game and he
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:43.080]  could care less about babies being chopped up and sold for money
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:47.080]  we've got mitch mcconnell who lies to people ted cruz called him out on it
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:50.920]  said you're a liar and then he came back and said that's not according
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:54.440]  that you broke the rules of decorum for the senate it's like no
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:57.640]  mitch mcconnell broke the rules of decorum for the senate when he lied when
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:01.160]  he lied to voters when he lied to his fellow senators
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:04.520]  we got a few people like cruz and paul and lee
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:07.880]  who want to do something about it but the vast majority of washington just
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:09.880]  isn't there we can just forget about getting
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:13.240]  anything done at the national level quite personally i mean we have tried
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:17.240]  voting people and now what 40 years we haven't had any success with that
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:22.360]  we have had success at the local level we can get things done at the local
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:24.520]  level we can get things done at the state level
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:28.360]  that's where every solution needs to be solved is at the state and local level
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:31.560]  we're not having any any luck with washington washington is nothing but a
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:35.080]  corrupt cancer it is a black hole of financial
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:38.680]  interest that will do anything the corporatists want in this case
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:41.880]  the corporation called plan parenthood they will give them anything that they
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:43.800]  want so i think we're going to have to go
[02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:47.560]  to the state level we're going to have to go to the local level going to have to
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:52.360]  run these people out of business look the city governments know how to put people
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:56.520]  they don't like out of business using city regulations you can do that at a
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:59.320]  city by city level you can get the right people
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:03.560]  in your city and you can say our city is not going to be a sanctuary city for
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:07.800]  infanticide you can do that you can elect the people at the local level
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:11.480]  much more easily than you can change this republican party
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:15.240]  which is at the call of the and and the behest of
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:22.520]  plan parenthood yeah absolutely i mean look yeah i i live in austin and uh and
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:25.640]  we found out recently that the city of austin
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:30.600]  was leasing a building to plan parenthood
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:34.440]  over 7 000 square foot facility for one dollar
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:40.040]  a year for a 20 year lease one dollar a year now
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:44.280]  you know that made me want to go okay well i want to open up a pro-life center
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:47.480]  and go to the city and say hey look i want that same deal
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:50.920]  that you gave plan parenthood they would never they would never
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:54.520]  consider doing that for us for a pro-life group who's actually wanting to save
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:58.920]  babies yet you know if you want to kill them if you want to harvest their parts
[02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:01.880]  then the city they'll give you all the money that you want
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:06.760]  it's a massive subsidy it's a massive subsidy and if you can't stop this at
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:11.800]  the local level if you can't get people out of the city of austin
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:15.800]  who are leasing a 7 000 square foot building for one dollar a year and a
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:18.440]  20 year lease to plan parenthood to subsidize that
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:21.800]  if you can't stop that in austin you're not going to be able to stop it in
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:25.960]  washington so get busy in austin get busy in your local community
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:28.440]  make sure that this is something is done about it
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:32.440]  you have the tools you can show people what this is there's no
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:35.800]  excuse for people being ignorant we've got the tapes
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:39.400]  we've got the video we've caught them red-handed we've caught them negotiating
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:42.600]  the price we've caught them doing this for money
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:45.560]  you as well as many other people have been telling us about it
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:49.400]  very much what you did reminds me of the nsa whistleblowers
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:52.600]  i mean we had people like william benney that we've had on the show
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:58.040]  many others who for years were undergoing persecution they came after
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:02.360]  thomas drake tried to set him up tried to get felony charges against him
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:05.960]  kirk werby we've talked to him william benney
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:09.400]  they told congress about it they did it the right way they went through the
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:12.600]  legal channels they said please do something about this this is
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:15.880]  unconstitutional it is very dangerous for the government to do this nobody
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:18.680]  did anything about it it took the snowden
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:22.040]  documents for people to wake up and understand but still
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:25.240]  like this nothing is happening we are at that moment now
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:28.760]  just like we are with the snowden documents we know what the nsa is doing
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:32.520]  we know the danger of the surveillance state and we know now
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:37.320]  there's no question about it this is for profit murder
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:42.440]  a la carte baby parts for sale this is abhorrent it needs to be stopped
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:46.840]  america has the information now the question the moral dilemma for america
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:51.720]  is are you going to own this are you going to change it
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:55.240]  because that's ultimately where it goes it's just like we see in the obama
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:59.880]  administration if there's if there's a massive persecution of the irs of
[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:03.720]  political opponents and the obama administration doesn't do anything about
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:07.800]  it then they own it just like nixon owned the corruption of those
[02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:11.960]  people who work for him the buck stops there well you know what the buck stops
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:15.640]  with you america because you now have this information
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:17.800]  what are you going to do about it what are you going to do about it in your
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:20.520]  community if you've got a planned parenthood facility
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:23.800]  like we do here in austin that's being subsidized by corrupt government what
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:26.760]  are you going to do about it what are you going to do about it

[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:02.920]  abby we were talking during the break about state senator
[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:08.040]  lee bright in south carolina he introduced a very stringent bill about
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:12.840]  fetal pain was it and you're telling me about the pushback that he got
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:16.280]  yeah inside the pro life movement right yeah i mean we
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:20.120]  see corruption even inside the pro life movement we see people pro life
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:24.040]  organizations who are constantly willing to accept these loopholes and
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:26.920]  bills and you know we as conservatives as pro
[02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:29.960]  lifers we have to be willing to fight against that and
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:33.720]  senator lee bright had there was a bill that was coming up that would ban
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:38.200]  abortions past 20 weeks in south carolina he
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:41.640]  it had an exception in it for rape and he said look
[02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:44.760]  either they're they're always babies or they're never babies they're not
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:48.840]  sometimes babies if the conception is is ideal right
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:52.920]  and and he said plus this is just a glaring loophole for the abortion
[02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:56.760]  industry to ram through and he said no i'm not going to do it and he said i
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:56:59.960]  need pro life organizations to support me so they're going to say in any
[02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:02.840]  particular case that sir loophole they can say well it was a case of rape
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:05.800]  tell us it was right yeah just tell us it was right write that down here sign
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:09.400]  that here when you get your abortion right and so uh you know he said no we're
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:12.680]  not going to do it so he stood strong against him was asking pro life groups
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:16.280]  to stand with him to get this amendment taken out and and to have it as a no
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:19.160]  exceptions bill and national right to life
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:22.440]  sent out his personal cell phone number to everybody on their list and said you
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:26.200]  need to call him admonish him chastise him for holding up this
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:29.800]  bill it is not just sometimes we are our own worst
[02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:34.200]  enemy and we need to stand united against abortion in all circumstances
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:37.960]  not just sometimes but always and we need to be willing to make the personal
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:41.400]  sacrifice you know even when it's uncomfortable when we moved to austin
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:45.400]  from brian college station uh we actually live in round rock and
[02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:47.720]  you know i said at the time when we moved
[02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:51.960]  travis county was subsidizing abortions at plan parenthood through local tax
[02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:56.040]  dollars and i said i am not going to move to a county
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:57:59.880]  that pays for abortion and so we chose to live in williamson county where it
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:03.400]  wasn't i there was really a beautiful house in austin that i wanted
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:07.160]  but i said no i'm not going to do it you have to do that and we sent a letter
[02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:10.600]  to you know to the city council letting them know and then eventually not
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:13.800]  because of me but because of many people they ended up not funding it anymore
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:16.600]  and of course they're still subsidizing it as you pointed out they give a one
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:20.520]  dollar lease on a seven thousand square foot facility that's a 20 year lease
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:24.040]  and when we talk about rape let's understand that plan parenthood
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:27.960]  facilitates statutory rape all the time they let
[02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:32.200]  young girls who have been raped statutorily because they're under age they
[02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:35.320]  let them get abortions all the time and they don't report it to law enforcement
[02:58:35.320 --> 02:58:38.760]  that's it for today join us tonight at seven central eight p.m eastern for the
