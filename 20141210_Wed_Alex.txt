[00:00.000 --> 00:13.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.440 --> 00:21.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.880 --> 00:31.360]  jones but you know when republicans say you know why now why this timing why not
[00:31.360 --> 00:35.320]  this time is a good time no that's not true she's leaving her
[00:35.320 --> 00:39.640]  chairmanship so diane feinstein wants to get this off her desk and look i agree
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.960]  with you the united states of america is awesome we are awesome but we've had
[00:44.960 --> 00:48.360]  this discussion we've closed the book on it and we've stopped doing it and the
[00:48.360 --> 00:51.480]  reason they want to have this discussion is not to show how awesome we
[00:51.480 --> 00:55.560]  are this administration wants to have this discussion to show us how we're
[00:55.560 --> 01:00.160]  not awesome this administration they apologize they don't like this country
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.320]  there are they look bad and all this does is have our enemies laughing at us
[01:05.320 --> 01:10.760]  well miss tontoros is right that this is being brought out as a political
[01:10.760 --> 01:16.880]  distraction from all the bad stuff obama's doing but she's wrong to sit there
[01:16.880 --> 01:20.480]  and imply then that it's purely partisan because the truth is they've got
[01:20.480 --> 01:24.960]  the black sites the ghost sites still going the torture has intensified it
[01:24.960 --> 01:31.320]  hasn't stopped it's just that a bunch of bush administration lawyers like john
[01:31.320 --> 01:39.360]  you bragged about the torture when it was clearly illegal and so that's now
[01:39.360 --> 01:44.400]  why the democrats are scoring points they all went along with it so just
[01:44.400 --> 01:48.360]  because both sides are involved doesn't make it okay or just because one side
[01:48.360 --> 01:55.160]  criticizes the other doesn't make them good guys the larger issue here is what
[01:55.160 --> 02:01.680]  is guantanamo bay camp x-ray and other camps around the world in the country
[02:01.680 --> 02:05.520]  really about i'm going to tell you what they're really about coming up in the

[02:23.200 --> 02:27.880]  south african to break down how it was used politically to divide folks in
[02:27.880 --> 02:32.120]  south africa so a black preacher and a white preacher who are friends by the
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.760]  way we're going to get both of their perspectives perspective you won't get
[02:36.760 --> 02:41.360]  from the controlled right of the control left the key is researching things
[02:41.360 --> 02:46.640]  outside the box to understand how the social engineers are manipulating things
[02:46.640 --> 02:51.560]  that's coming up and then dr. steve pacenek on the torture report put out by
[02:51.560 --> 02:58.120]  diane feinstein that's all a bunch of smoke and mirrors that we're getting to
[02:58.120 --> 03:01.680]  the bottom of it and oh it gave us this great intel and oh it's not really
[03:01.680 --> 03:05.840]  torture it's enhanced or man you ought to see the russians they really torture
[03:05.840 --> 03:13.760]  or boy the chinese they really torture so why shouldn't we because torture is
[03:13.760 --> 03:19.000]  extremely useful and extremely effective is why we shouldn't be doing it now

[09:35.680 --> 09:39.680]  we're going to be here for the next three hours live as we are every week
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.960]  day 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard time and of course I'll be back this
[09:43.960 --> 09:52.240]  Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m. central as well we have info wars nightly news that is
[09:52.240 --> 09:57.760]  of course at 7 o'clock central and we saw will cast the nightly news at
[09:57.760 --> 10:07.480]  prison planet dot TV where to start where to begin because there is so much to go
[10:07.480 --> 10:12.800]  over here obviously today the big news story that we've been covering since it
[10:12.800 --> 10:20.360]  began 13 years ago is the fact that torture is ubiquitous throughout the
[10:20.360 --> 10:26.720]  U.S. military services now Joe Biggs we really ought to do our interview with
[10:26.720 --> 10:32.480]  and a report on in studio talking about his experiences with it would go out on
[10:32.480 --> 10:37.120]  patrols grab people out of their houses they were ordered to target and deliver
[10:37.120 --> 10:44.960]  them to the FBI the DEA special forces CIA depending on which group it was and
[10:44.960 --> 10:51.360]  sometimes the people didn't come out and they would hear the screaming the
[10:51.360 --> 10:59.920]  begging it would go on and on and on there have been special investigations
[10:59.920 --> 11:05.240]  there have been admissions there have been investigative journalists reports
[11:05.240 --> 11:10.000]  where soldiers have gone public admitting that sometimes they go into a
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  village in Afghanistan and just kill everyone in it including babies and then
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.360]  the argument is well that's how you get tough and win wars you know your fire
[11:21.360 --> 11:29.760]  bomb Dresden know what you really do is lose the moral high ground and then
[11:29.760 --> 11:37.960]  America can be demonized worldwide but know this Diane Feinstein Senate report
[11:37.960 --> 11:43.600]  on CIA and enhanced interrogation as it's called that'd be like if I robbed a
[11:43.600 --> 11:52.480]  bank at high noon with a machine gun and roughed up a few of the tellers or if
[11:52.480 --> 11:55.720]  you did it and when the police came you said I'm not robbing a bank in armed
[11:55.720 --> 12:07.440]  robbery aggravated robbery I am engaged in a enhanced withdrawal from the bank
[12:07.440 --> 12:13.800]  or if you beat somebody to death with a baseball bat you you didn't beat him to
[12:13.800 --> 12:20.520]  death you were just involved in an enhanced massage now the argument is
[12:20.520 --> 12:25.480]  these people blew up the World Trade Centers and so they deserve it we're
[12:25.480 --> 12:32.880]  taking the gloves off everything that's been done with torture rendition the
[12:32.880 --> 12:45.200]  NDAA the Patriot acts one and two from day one was focused on the American
[12:45.200 --> 12:53.440]  people period that's it it's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and
[12:53.440 --> 12:58.240]  Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly saying it's for Al Qaeda
[12:58.240 --> 13:02.440]  rolling out torture saying it's for Al Qaeda but it's really for the general
[13:02.440 --> 13:07.280]  public rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market
[13:07.280 --> 13:11.040]  systems in the name of fighting Al Qaeda but really shutting down any type of
[13:11.040 --> 13:17.160]  free commerce this is all about converting us from a free society to a
[13:17.160 --> 13:27.880]  tyranny with a capital T now I know that most of our audience knows that but I
[13:27.880 --> 13:37.840]  wanted today to actually get into what torture itself is really being carried
[13:37.840 --> 13:45.160]  out for first and foremost if the people that have hijacked our government can
[13:45.160 --> 13:52.720]  never get away with openly selling torture the sky's the limit already for
[13:52.720 --> 13:58.320]  more than 30 years in this country they have what they call pain compliance in
[13:58.320 --> 14:03.800]  police departments and in my film martial law we show large clips of this of the
[14:03.800 --> 14:10.320]  LAPD and others breaking pro-lifers arms for sitting on the sidewalk with
[14:10.320 --> 14:20.040]  numb chucks twisting them around their arms and breaking them in fact we go to
[14:20.040 --> 14:26.760]  YouTube guys and type in martial law 9-1-1 the police state and just skip
[14:26.760 --> 14:30.600]  ahead like three hours of the very last ten minutes of the film there's an
[14:30.600 --> 14:38.280]  extra that gets into torture we ought to re-air that whole extra here on air
[14:38.280 --> 14:44.760]  sometime it's like 10 minutes long very very powerful it shows in Cincinnati and
[14:44.760 --> 14:53.000]  it shows in LA peaceful people on the sidewalks having two cops with Billy
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.160]  clubs twist them together till the arm breaks or twisting numb chucks around and
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.360]  then break in the arm and the Christians still just sits there bleeding on the
[15:01.360 --> 15:04.760]  ground and the cops go with Billy clubs and start beating them in the head
[15:04.760 --> 15:10.160]  that's a police state that's illegal and it's torture and Democratic Party
[15:10.160 --> 15:14.600]  judges back it in Democratic Party controlled areas if you look at where
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.480]  torture actually goes on on the books and is defended by the judges
[15:19.480 --> 15:23.760]  Democratic controlled areas now the Republicans are wild police state
[15:23.760 --> 15:31.360]  pushers as well there's a lot of things that factor into this larger system
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.320]  number one it's about using it domestically and being able to corrupt
[15:35.320 --> 15:41.600]  the judicial system beyond repair number two it's about getting fake
[15:41.600 --> 15:47.920]  confessions number three it's about having laboratories with people as
[15:47.920 --> 15:52.240]  young as 14 at Camp x-ray and other camps around the world not just Gitmo
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.160]  where they can grab innocent people but psychologically profile them and find
[15:57.160 --> 16:00.760]  people that can be double and triple agents to actually go out and lead
[16:00.760 --> 16:08.520]  ISIS Al Qaeda Brigades and they had 17 year olds and people that were in Gitmo
[16:08.520 --> 16:13.360]  for eight years that were released when they're 25 years old to go command
[16:13.360 --> 16:19.160]  brigades of 4,000 men and they know where to get the drop-offs of the weapons
[16:19.160 --> 16:25.720]  they are the intermediary with the C-130s that land with the weapons they
[16:25.720 --> 16:34.280]  are the ones that do this so it's actually a college to find recruits just
[16:34.280 --> 16:38.480]  like a Soviet reeducation camp would be an old sports stadium or an old prison
[16:38.480 --> 16:42.160]  and they would bring in tens of thousands of people per week most of
[16:42.160 --> 16:45.600]  them would only stay a few days they'd beat you torture you find out if you
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.320]  were easy to break if you'd go on their payroll and be one of their operatives
[16:49.320 --> 16:53.960]  it's mainly about bringing you under control bringing you under fear and
[16:53.960 --> 17:01.440]  that's what they do at Gitmo is they find the people that will be the double
[17:01.440 --> 17:09.720]  and triple agents so understand that that the CIA base and DARPA base that is
[17:09.720 --> 17:20.400]  admitted to be within Gitmo is admittedly a CIA mind control laboratory we
[17:20.400 --> 17:24.800]  are showing for TV viewers and info wars.com or slash show peaceful pro
[17:24.800 --> 17:29.080]  lifers on the sidewalks one after the other having their arms broken with
[17:29.080 --> 17:36.040]  precision you're gonna hear anything from Diane Feinstein about that turns out
[17:36.040 --> 17:43.440]  when she was a senator she pressured the courts to rule this legal and I've
[17:43.440 --> 17:45.960]  noticed whenever the cops break one of their arms the others will come up to
[17:45.960 --> 17:51.200]  start beating them to second it just to say I certify this is good gouging
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.560]  their eyes in grabbing their noses and pulling them up till they break them do
[17:56.560 --> 18:03.040]  you see Christians in mass out there saying I can't breathe no because these
[18:03.040 --> 18:06.800]  are people trying to save unborn babies
[18:10.720 --> 18:14.880]  and we've got hours of the video as they just sit there grabbing women's hair
[18:14.880 --> 18:19.360]  gouging their eyes in twisting their arms till they break choking them so
[18:19.360 --> 18:23.600]  understand folks this is being done across the board this is what bipartisanly
[18:23.600 --> 18:31.200]  the police since the 70s have been taught to do in many departments they
[18:31.200 --> 18:34.040]  could just pick them up and throw them in a paddy wagon like places like Austin
[18:34.040 --> 18:37.640]  Texas I mean Austin's got its own problems but I'm sorry I've been all over
[18:37.640 --> 18:41.640]  the country I'm not just kissing up the awesome police it's true they don't do
[18:41.640 --> 18:50.120]  this type of thing it's psychopathic it's evil so let's get one thing straight
[18:50.120 --> 18:55.320]  this tortures all about legitimizing in here but more importantly in the larger
[18:55.320 --> 19:01.320]  aspect worldwide radical Islam is being funded protected shepherded and when we
[19:01.320 --> 19:05.680]  let the system take our rights away in the name of phytic and radical Islam we
[19:05.680 --> 19:11.320]  fall into the larger trap and we lose the moral high ground China Russia all
[19:11.320 --> 19:15.600]  these other countries can criticize us and call us despicable now because our
[19:15.600 --> 19:21.880]  government admitted they did all this then lied about it later that's all
[19:21.880 --> 19:26.560]  part of demonizing us towards the collapse later when America served its
[19:26.560 --> 19:31.240]  usefulness to the world government because when they demonize America they
[19:31.240 --> 19:34.840]  even ice free market the Second Amendment John Wayne stuff like that
[19:34.840 --> 19:40.120]  that all gets the blame capitalism gets the blame for the crony insider

[24:28.680 --> 24:32.960]  chairmanship so Diane Feinstein wants to get this off her desk and look I agree
[24:32.960 --> 24:41.600]  with you the United States of America is awesome we are awesome
[25:32.960 --> 25:49.440]  her name is Andrea Tontaros and any criticism of the system is just you
[25:49.440 --> 25:54.000]  saying America isn't awesome no America's awesome and exceptional when we
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.560]  have the lowest taxes the most freedom the best courts the most transparent
[26:00.560 --> 26:06.080]  systems America is not awesome we have the biggest government in the world the
[26:06.080 --> 26:10.280]  biggest debt in the world the most unhealthy people in the world paramilitary
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.200]  police totally legal surveillance our government is hiring al-Qaeda groups
[26:15.200 --> 26:22.560]  calling them ISIS to turn loose against Syria then they go crazy break ranks and
[26:22.560 --> 26:28.560]  go into Iraq so now we have to fight them everything is not awesome and there's
[26:28.560 --> 26:33.240]  this cult-like mentality out there that if you just say everything's awesome and
[26:33.240 --> 26:38.480]  live in denial you'll be okay almost everybody I know who's had kids that
[26:38.480 --> 26:44.200]  commit suicide almost everybody I know who has horrible stuff happened in their
[26:44.200 --> 26:53.520]  life live in denial and say everything is awesome and we'll tell their friends
[26:53.520 --> 27:00.920]  and family and others good job when they haven't done a good job I'm not one
[27:00.920 --> 27:05.440]  tenth as extreme as the fictional character in the movie whiplash that I
[27:05.440 --> 27:08.520]  wouldn't saw this weekend I thought it was excellent but at the end you find
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.120]  out he's not really a bad guy he was actually trying to push someone who had
[27:13.120 --> 27:17.320]  incredible talent to the next level and you know what if you don't want to act
[27:17.320 --> 27:21.120]  like a free person and you don't want to stand up for yourself you're gonna be a
[27:21.120 --> 27:27.960]  slave and slaves usually have some little shuck-and-jive dance that they put
[27:27.960 --> 27:32.800]  on politically of why it's okay that they're slaves and okay that they lay
[27:32.800 --> 27:42.240]  down and okay that they went along with evil but make no mistake even if you
[27:42.240 --> 27:50.800]  hate Muslims with a diehard passion know that the people running our country
[27:50.800 --> 27:54.440]  into the ground are financing radical Islam and turning it loses a weapon
[27:54.440 --> 27:59.520]  against non-radical Muslims all over the world and are turning them against us
[27:59.520 --> 28:03.720]  so the government can play the part of the hero and the savior and take our
[28:03.720 --> 28:09.600]  freedoms and then flip homeland security on the people whether it's Germany or
[28:09.600 --> 28:15.360]  England or the United States or Russia they all used 9-11 to take people's
[28:15.360 --> 28:21.360]  freedoms and now they use the Patriot Act against land rights activists now
[28:21.360 --> 28:24.560]  they say use the Patriot Act against the Bundy's and they say they're
[28:24.560 --> 28:28.560]  domestic terrorists and in all the police and military training manuals
[28:28.560 --> 28:34.840]  they say Christians point blank or terrorist gun owners point blank or
[28:34.840 --> 28:39.000]  terrorist I mean they don't just say radical extremists watch them like they
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.760]  did ten years ago or six years ago now they say point blank if you're an
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.880]  evangelical or you're in the Tea Party that's terrorist we will court martial
[28:47.880 --> 28:57.120]  you so here we are and then when Major Hassan goes around and kills 14 people
[28:57.120 --> 29:02.360]  and injures 25 or whatever at Fort Hood they won't call that terrorism judge
[29:02.360 --> 29:05.720]  finally ruled it was and they're giving them purple hearts and certainly was
[29:05.720 --> 29:13.680]  terrorism why didn't they want that because they want to continue to bring
[29:13.680 --> 29:18.280]  these radicals into the country they want to continue to protect them and for
[29:18.280 --> 29:22.120]  two years the CIA was tracking Hassan talking to the head of al-Qaeda and
[29:22.120 --> 29:25.760]  knew he was gonna attack and they've declared national security on those
[29:25.760 --> 29:30.080]  emails in Congress but congressmen have spoken out about it that the CIA knew of
[29:30.080 --> 29:37.320]  course they knew they run these people they helped set up what is al-Qaeda today
[29:37.320 --> 29:44.080]  I don't want to hear about torture to stop them or stop their next attack they're
[29:44.080 --> 29:51.120]  at Guantanamo Bay building terrorists you understand that we're on the March the

[33:37.800 --> 33:46.800]  I'm going to break down exactly what's behind torture.
[33:46.800 --> 33:49.800]  It's already gone over a lot of it, but I want to give people a big picture.
[33:49.800 --> 33:52.800]  Not from my perspective, this is all on records.
[33:52.800 --> 33:57.800]  And why are they putting out this report now? Where is this all going?
[33:57.800 --> 34:02.800]  Now, there's a philosophy they're following, and I want to explain that.
[34:02.800 --> 34:03.800]  We'll do it in one moment.
[34:03.800 --> 34:07.800]  I'm very excited that only after being sold out for, I don't know, three weeks,
[34:07.800 --> 34:12.800]  we have been able to produce right here in America the highest quality,
[34:12.800 --> 34:16.800]  sublingual or lingual, that is taken by mouth, on the tongue or under the tongue,
[34:16.800 --> 34:19.800]  vitamin B12, secret 12.
[34:19.800 --> 34:23.800]  You saw me for about a year, in here, taking it each day,
[34:23.800 --> 34:27.800]  when I would put it in the water of your TV viewer and mix it with the X2,
[34:27.800 --> 34:29.800]  nascent iodine, supermal vitality.
[34:29.800 --> 34:31.800]  I do that a couple of times a day.
[34:31.800 --> 34:34.800]  I just add it to my water. I love it.
[34:34.800 --> 34:37.800]  Well, now we can tell you what it is.
[34:37.800 --> 34:43.800]  It's secret 12. See the full write-up of the molecules of why it's pharmaceutical grade
[34:43.800 --> 34:47.800]  and more at infowarslife.com.
[34:47.800 --> 34:49.800]  12 is 80% methylcobalamin.
[34:49.800 --> 34:51.800]  That's the type that people inject.
[34:51.800 --> 34:55.800]  And then 20% this other type of organic that fuses together,
[34:55.800 --> 34:58.800]  especially cofactors, meant to help you absorb it.
[34:58.800 --> 35:01.800]  And it's of the vegetarian type as well.
[35:01.800 --> 35:04.800]  It was developed for vegetarians.
[35:04.800 --> 35:07.800]  But then it was found to absorb even more.
[35:07.800 --> 35:13.800]  So normally you only absorb 7 to 10, maybe 12% of it when you take it by mouth.
[35:13.800 --> 35:16.800]  Injection is about 90% depending on the person's body.
[35:16.800 --> 35:21.800]  This, we believe from our research, is much more absorbable.
[35:21.800 --> 35:26.800]  I've taken other sublingual vitamin B12s, does not have one-tenth the effect on me personally.
[35:26.800 --> 35:28.800]  It's very affordably priced as well.
[35:28.800 --> 35:32.800]  It is super high quality, no additives, no nothing.
[35:32.800 --> 35:34.800]  Just two types of B12.
[35:34.800 --> 35:37.800]  And the best part is children think it's candy.
[35:37.800 --> 35:40.800]  It tastes sweet. It is delicious.
[35:40.800 --> 35:44.800]  Because that's what this nutrient actually tastes like.
[35:44.800 --> 35:49.800]  So you want the highest quality B12 out there at a very affordable price
[35:49.800 --> 35:51.800]  and support the InfoWare.
[35:51.800 --> 35:54.800]  We got a very limited run-in.
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.800]  And it'll probably be another three to four or five weeks when it sells out until we get it.
[35:58.800 --> 36:01.800]  We've been out for three weeks, secret 12.
[36:01.800 --> 36:04.800]  And if you order now, you can get it well before Christmas.
[36:04.800 --> 36:09.800]  All orders up until the 17th are guaranteed in the lower 48.
[36:09.800 --> 36:13.800]  We can really ship out past that to like the 19th to 20th.
[36:13.800 --> 36:14.800]  We'll probably still get it.
[36:14.800 --> 36:16.800]  Or just saying, order by the 17th.
[36:16.800 --> 36:19.800]  We can get it out on the 18th or 19th and get it to you.
[36:19.800 --> 36:28.800]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[36:28.800 --> 36:32.800]  Also, I was seeing Rob Dew lost 18 pounds on oxy powder in one week.
[36:32.800 --> 36:34.800]  That was another testimony of somebody else in the office.
[36:34.800 --> 36:37.800]  I was mixing the two, conflating the two by accident.
[36:37.800 --> 36:38.800]  He lost because he wasn't fat.
[36:38.800 --> 36:40.800]  He just had a little bit of a belly for some reason.
[36:40.800 --> 36:42.800]  The rest of him was all muscle.
[36:42.800 --> 36:45.800]  Because I know I've been to him many times with him and his family and his wife and my kids.
[36:45.800 --> 36:48.800]  He had a little belly, like most of us do, even if you're skinny.
[36:48.800 --> 36:53.800]  It just went away in a week because it was all that detritus in there blew out.
[36:53.800 --> 36:55.800]  He took seven caplets a day.
[36:55.800 --> 36:57.800]  They recommend four to five.
[36:57.800 --> 37:00.800]  I'm here to tell you this is, of all the products,
[37:00.800 --> 37:04.800]  this is the one with the most rave reviews that people say is life-changing.
[37:04.800 --> 37:08.800]  Because it's not some harsh herbs or something that could be painful,
[37:08.800 --> 37:11.800]  make you take off work that flushes you out.
[37:11.800 --> 37:18.800]  This is time-released proprietary oxygen that ozonates inside the lower and upper intestine,
[37:18.800 --> 37:20.800]  large and small intestine.
[37:20.800 --> 37:22.800]  And he is dramatic.
[37:22.800 --> 37:24.800]  And I've talked to a lot of other crew.
[37:24.800 --> 37:26.800]  CJ's talked about what it's done for him.
[37:26.800 --> 37:29.800]  This is not a game. It's not a joke.
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.800]  We only bring in the most hardcore products that also help fund InfoWars.com,
[37:33.800 --> 37:37.800]  PrisonPlanet.com, The Nightly News, The Filmmaking, The Writers,
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.800]  a true independent news organization openly biased towards liberty,
[37:41.800 --> 37:45.800]  biased to the truth, biased to having a policy of truth.
[37:45.800 --> 37:47.800]  I disagree with Depeche Mode.
[37:47.800 --> 37:50.800]  They say a policy of truth gets you in trouble.
[37:50.800 --> 37:53.800]  I really don't think that's the case unless it's, you know,
[37:53.800 --> 37:55.800]  a woman asks you if a dress looks good, you don't think it looks good,
[37:55.800 --> 37:58.800]  you just got to tell them it looks good because they don't really want to be told that it looks bad.
[37:58.800 --> 38:00.800]  They want to be told that you like the dress.
[38:00.800 --> 38:03.800]  But other than that, I don't engage in a lot of lying, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:03.800 --> 38:07.800]  And, you know, if my mom makes some food every once in a while that didn't the best,
[38:07.800 --> 38:09.800]  if my mom is a great cook, it doesn't taste too good.
[38:09.800 --> 38:12.800]  I say, yeah, really good.
[38:12.800 --> 38:14.800]  I like that other recipe, though, better.
[38:14.800 --> 38:17.800]  But other than that, I'm just a straight shooter.
[38:17.800 --> 38:22.800]  And we have the highest quality products at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com,
[38:22.800 --> 38:26.800]  or call 888-253-3139.
[38:26.800 --> 38:28.800]  We're also running the special right into the new year,
[38:28.800 --> 38:34.800]  half off yearlyprisonplanet.tv memberships, 20 people can use each membership.
[38:34.800 --> 38:36.800]  If you have a membership, be sure and share it.
[38:36.800 --> 38:41.800]  You can get all your Christmas shopping done in one day at InfoWarsStore.com
[38:41.800 --> 38:44.800]  and know you're getting high quality products, whether it's camouflage,
[38:44.800 --> 38:48.800]  Molan Labé, come and take it, shirts made in America,
[38:48.800 --> 38:54.800]  or whether it's limited edition Molan Labé belt buckles
[38:54.800 --> 38:58.800]  or the commemorative Molan Labé coin.
[38:58.800 --> 39:00.800]  Only 500 have been minted.
[39:00.800 --> 39:02.800]  It's been double stamped.
[39:02.800 --> 39:05.800]  It's just the highest grade that we were able to get,
[39:05.800 --> 39:08.800]  made right here in the good old U.S. of A.
[39:08.800 --> 39:16.800]  That's InfoWarsStore.com, or InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[39:16.800 --> 39:19.800]  And MSNBC attacks me for selling stuff.
[39:19.800 --> 39:21.800]  They get taxpayer money.
[39:21.800 --> 39:24.800]  We'll just point out again in bailout money, NPR gets taxpayer money.
[39:24.800 --> 39:27.800]  See how sick and filthy they are.
[39:27.800 --> 39:29.800]  See how disgusting they are.
[39:29.800 --> 39:32.800]  They don't want the Liberty Movement to have its own organizations.
[39:32.800 --> 39:34.800]  They don't want us to have our own platforms.
[39:34.800 --> 39:37.800]  Bill Clinton's documents got released last year,
[39:37.800 --> 39:39.800]  and this year more got released.
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.800]  WorldNet Daily got them.
[39:41.800 --> 39:43.800]  And there they were in the early 1990s saying,
[39:43.800 --> 39:46.800]  we got to shut down Joseph Farah and the Western Journalism Center
[39:46.800 --> 39:49.800]  because if the people ever understand they can put out their own media,
[39:49.800 --> 39:51.800]  we won't control reality anymore,
[39:51.800 --> 39:55.800]  and won't have our operation mockingbird over the mainstream media anymore.
[39:55.800 --> 39:58.800]  Well, guess what, Clinton? You failed.
[39:58.800 --> 40:01.800]  But now they're striking back so it's more important than ever
[40:01.800 --> 40:04.800]  to support our local AM and FM affiliates.
[40:04.800 --> 40:07.800]  It's more important than ever to support their local sponsors
[40:07.800 --> 40:09.800]  or to become a sponsor.
[40:09.800 --> 40:13.800]  If you build it, if you support Liberty, it will take over.
[40:13.800 --> 40:16.800]  If you believe we can change society, we will win.
[40:16.800 --> 40:21.800]  But if you don't believe that, we don't have a prayer in Hades
[40:21.800 --> 40:24.800]  of turning things around, and so you might as well just kiss your future,
[40:24.800 --> 40:27.800]  your prosperity, and your children goodbye,
[40:27.800 --> 40:29.800]  and bend over to be a slave to the New World Order
[40:29.800 --> 40:32.800]  for those shackles to get put on your arms,
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.800]  because it is here in a big, big way.
[40:37.800 --> 40:44.800]  Now, before I get to my breakdown
[40:44.800 --> 40:46.800]  of what's really going on with torture
[40:46.800 --> 40:49.800]  and why we should all be against it,
[40:49.800 --> 40:54.800]  but why the system is also for it,
[40:54.800 --> 40:58.800]  I want to go to David Knight's report.
[40:58.800 --> 41:01.800]  There's also one by Lee Ann McAdoo we're going to play later.
[41:01.800 --> 41:07.800]  Torture of the ugly truth Feinstein won't confront.
[41:07.800 --> 41:09.800]  And we're going to play that report that I'm going to come back
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.800]  in three and a half minutes and give you my multifaceted take
[41:13.800 --> 41:15.800]  on what's really behind the torture
[41:15.800 --> 41:19.800]  and also why we want to be vehemently opposed to it.
[41:19.800 --> 41:23.800]  Here is that special report with David Knight.
[41:23.800 --> 41:26.800]  As Gruber goes before Congress to be drilled for torturing the data
[41:26.800 --> 41:29.800]  about Obamacare in order to deceive the American people,
[41:29.800 --> 41:33.800]  a heavily edited and censored report about actual torture
[41:33.800 --> 41:35.800]  was released by the Senate.
[41:35.800 --> 41:38.800]  Republican and Democrat reactions have been as predictable
[41:38.800 --> 41:41.800]  as they are hypocritical, but the most surprising reaction
[41:41.800 --> 41:43.800]  has come from some libertarians
[41:43.800 --> 41:45.800]  who have in the past opposed torture.
[41:45.800 --> 41:48.800]  More on that in a moment, but first the politicians.
[41:48.800 --> 41:52.800]  Senator Feinstein is sanctimoniously promoting the release
[41:52.800 --> 41:55.800]  as a confrontation of the ugly truth.
[41:55.800 --> 42:00.800]  History will judge us by our commitment to a just society
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.800]  governed by law and the willingness to face an ugly truth
[42:05.800 --> 42:07.800]  and say never again.
[42:07.800 --> 42:09.800]  Without any sense of irony or guilt,
[42:09.800 --> 42:13.800]  Feinstein says that on the very same day that the NDAA
[42:13.800 --> 42:15.800]  heads to the Senate floor for the fourth time
[42:15.800 --> 42:17.800]  under her leadership.
[42:17.800 --> 42:19.800]  It destroys our commitment to a just society
[42:19.800 --> 42:21.800]  governed by the rule of law when it presumes
[42:21.800 --> 42:24.800]  to authorize illegal unconstitutional actions
[42:24.800 --> 42:27.800]  like indefinite detention of U.S. citizens
[42:27.800 --> 42:29.800]  by the military without any charges,
[42:29.800 --> 42:33.800]  as well as rendition and presumably enhanced interrogation,
[42:33.800 --> 42:36.800]  federal government's euphemism for torture.
[42:36.800 --> 42:38.800]  She won't face that ugly truth.
[42:38.800 --> 42:43.800]  She won't say never again, but rather let's do it again.
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.800]  And of course after the 1600 page NDAA was released
[42:47.800 --> 42:50.800]  at 1030 at night, the GOP House passed it
[42:50.800 --> 42:53.800]  just a day and a half later, mocking their pledge
[42:53.800 --> 42:56.800]  of 2010 to always read the bill.
[42:56.800 --> 42:59.800]  And they're going to do the same thing with the omnibus,
[42:59.800 --> 43:01.800]  continuing resolution spending bill,
[43:01.800 --> 43:04.800]  keeping it secret until just a few hours before the vote.
[43:04.800 --> 43:07.800]  And will the Republican, who's likely to take Feinstein's place
[43:07.800 --> 43:09.800]  on the Senate Intelligence Committee,
[43:09.800 --> 43:11.800]  be any better than Feinstein?
[43:11.800 --> 43:13.800]  Absolutely not.
[43:13.800 --> 43:15.800]  Richard Burr will be much worse,
[43:15.800 --> 43:17.800]  having already gone on record saying there shouldn't be
[43:17.800 --> 43:20.800]  any public hearing about what the CIA or the NSA does
[43:20.800 --> 43:22.800]  about anything.
[43:22.800 --> 43:25.800]  But the most amazing reaction that shows how low America
[43:25.800 --> 43:29.800]  has already sunk into accepting a lawless government
[43:29.800 --> 43:32.800]  comes from the executive director of the ACLU,
[43:32.800 --> 43:35.800]  who previously lobbied Bush to oppose presidential pardons
[43:35.800 --> 43:38.800]  for those who had planned and authorized torture.
[43:38.800 --> 43:41.800]  The ACLU director points out that neither Obama
[43:41.800 --> 43:44.800]  nor the Justice Department has shown any appetite
[43:44.800 --> 43:46.800]  for holding anyone accountable.
[43:46.800 --> 43:48.800]  When the department did conduct an investigation,
[43:48.800 --> 43:50.800]  it appeared not to have interviewed any
[43:50.800 --> 43:52.800]  of the prisoners who were tortured.
[43:52.800 --> 43:55.800]  And it repeatedly abused the state secrets privilege
[43:55.800 --> 43:58.800]  in order to derail cases brought by prisoners,
[43:58.800 --> 44:02.800]  including Americans, who were tortured as enemy combatants.
[44:02.800 --> 44:05.800]  But now the ACLU is calling for formal pardons
[44:05.800 --> 44:06.800]  for these people.
[44:06.800 --> 44:09.800]  Their tortured logic, worthy of John Gruber,
[44:09.800 --> 44:12.800]  is that doing nothing as Obama has and will do
[44:12.800 --> 44:14.800]  is a tacit pardon.
[44:14.800 --> 44:17.800]  We need to have, they say, an explicit pardon,
[44:17.800 --> 44:20.800]  so we can, as a society, at least acknowledge
[44:20.800 --> 44:22.800]  that laws were broken.
[44:22.800 --> 44:23.800]  That's it.
[44:23.800 --> 44:26.800]  No longer any hope of criminal prosecution for leaders
[44:26.800 --> 44:29.800]  and government employees who violate the law,
[44:29.800 --> 44:33.800]  commit treason and torture people, including American citizens.
[44:33.800 --> 44:36.800]  No, the best we can hope for is to say it was wrong.
[44:36.800 --> 44:39.800]  But don't think that you're going to even get that
[44:39.800 --> 44:41.800]  in this kind of lawless society.
[44:41.800 --> 44:44.800]  Our government no longer has the will to punish cops
[44:44.800 --> 44:48.800]  who murder or politicians who torture and murder.
[44:48.800 --> 44:51.800]  That's the real ugly truth we have to confront.
[44:51.800 --> 44:54.800]  For Infowars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[44:54.800 --> 44:57.800]  You're so blessed to have David Knight
[44:57.800 --> 45:00.800]  here in our operation, just an amazing mind, great research,
[45:00.800 --> 45:04.800]  and a great host of the Nightly News and this radio show.
[45:04.800 --> 45:08.800]  The reason I played that report is he gets at the heart of it.
[45:08.800 --> 45:11.800]  And then I'll add to all the satellite issues
[45:11.800 --> 45:13.800]  that are connected to it.
[45:13.800 --> 45:16.800]  There's a philosophy of the globalists.
[45:16.800 --> 45:20.800]  Create financial banking systems where central private banks
[45:20.800 --> 45:22.800]  control the issuance of currency and credit
[45:22.800 --> 45:24.800]  they're able to take over the world.
[45:24.800 --> 45:27.800]  Then to illegitimately continue that
[45:27.800 --> 45:30.800]  and expand social engineering towards their aim
[45:30.800 --> 45:35.800]  of population reduction, they then want to set up police states
[45:35.800 --> 45:36.800]  to do that.
[45:36.800 --> 45:39.800]  They've got to fund and finance and protect terrorist groups
[45:39.800 --> 45:42.800]  to create the outside threat to allow them to come in
[45:42.800 --> 45:43.800]  and take control.
[45:43.800 --> 45:46.800]  And this isn't me saying this 14 years ago.
[45:46.800 --> 45:49.800]  I said it 14 years ago and now it's come true.
[45:49.800 --> 45:53.800]  So there's no debate about that.
[45:53.800 --> 45:55.800]  And an example of this is the NSA.
[45:55.800 --> 45:59.800]  Illegally spying on us for political control,
[45:59.800 --> 46:03.800]  to control the markets, to target their political enemies,
[46:03.800 --> 46:07.800]  totally illegal, classical, 200 proof tyranny.
[46:07.800 --> 46:12.800]  Notabating.
[46:12.800 --> 46:13.800]  Then they deny it's happening.
[46:13.800 --> 46:15.800]  They get caught doing it.
[46:15.800 --> 46:17.800]  Then they make excuses for it.
[46:17.800 --> 46:18.800]  Whitewash it.
[46:18.800 --> 46:21.800]  Don't get in trouble for it and are now coming out
[46:21.800 --> 46:24.800]  with new laws they're trying to pass
[46:24.800 --> 46:27.800]  to codify it on the books
[46:27.800 --> 46:30.800]  where there'll be no due process period.
[46:30.800 --> 46:34.800]  In anything.
[46:34.800 --> 46:35.800]  This is what they do.
[46:35.800 --> 46:37.800]  They commit to evil when they get caught.
[46:37.800 --> 46:39.800]  They whitewash it, legitimize it,
[46:39.800 --> 46:44.800]  and have the courts and the legislatures certify it.
[46:44.800 --> 46:48.800]  I remember having guessed on 19 years ago
[46:48.800 --> 46:52.800]  who were showing me Mears documents and others,
[46:52.800 --> 46:54.800]  believe it had Mears,
[46:54.800 --> 46:57.800]  documents dealing with robo-signing
[46:57.800 --> 47:01.800]  and telling me that they're selling mortgages 10, 20, 30 times
[47:01.800 --> 47:03.800]  and teaching me about derivatives.
[47:03.800 --> 47:06.800]  And some of them were like former city council members
[47:06.800 --> 47:11.800]  and economists like George Humphrey.
[47:11.800 --> 47:13.800]  I mean, I knew he'd been on the city council
[47:13.800 --> 47:14.800]  when I was in high school.
[47:14.800 --> 47:17.800]  I knew he was a wealthy guy
[47:17.800 --> 47:18.800]  that owned buildings downtown.
[47:18.800 --> 47:21.800]  I knew that he owned clothing stores around the country.
[47:21.800 --> 47:24.800]  I mean, I knew he was a well-known guy around town
[47:24.800 --> 47:27.800]  and I started fighting the New World Order
[47:27.800 --> 47:28.800]  and George said, hey, let's go out to eat
[47:28.800 --> 47:30.800]  or, hey, come on my access show.
[47:30.800 --> 47:32.800]  He would go to an access show just to get the word out.
[47:32.800 --> 47:33.800]  He also wrote books and things.
[47:33.800 --> 47:36.800]  He's been a frequent guest here.
[47:36.800 --> 47:38.800]  He's so zinned out now.
[47:38.800 --> 47:40.800]  He just, it didn't involve that much anymore.
[47:40.800 --> 47:42.800]  He's involved some.
[47:42.800 --> 47:43.800]  Zinned out is the word, by the way.
[47:43.800 --> 47:46.800]  He's a great guy, like Obi-Wan Kenobi or something,
[47:46.800 --> 47:50.800]  but George said, let me explain how it really works.
[47:50.800 --> 47:52.800]  He explained derivatives.
[47:52.800 --> 47:54.800]  He explained how the whole show goes.
[47:54.800 --> 47:57.800]  But see, I would then talk about that and have guests on
[47:57.800 --> 48:00.800]  and people thought I was a space alien.
[48:00.800 --> 48:03.800]  Now everybody knows about RoboSigners and derivatives
[48:03.800 --> 48:05.800]  and credit default swaps
[48:05.800 --> 48:08.800]  and how they sell some mortgages a hundred times
[48:08.800 --> 48:10.800]  or people who had their mortgage paid off for 20 years
[48:10.800 --> 48:12.800]  and had paid cash.
[48:12.800 --> 48:15.800]  Bank of America comes along and forecloses.
[48:15.800 --> 48:19.800]  They never even held a note.
[48:19.800 --> 48:21.800]  How does that happen?
[48:21.800 --> 48:22.800]  Well, they got caught.
[48:22.800 --> 48:23.800]  Did they stop it?
[48:23.800 --> 48:26.800]  No, they've intensified it.
[48:26.800 --> 48:29.800]  They've expanded it.
[48:29.800 --> 48:31.800]  And now they're getting state legislatures
[48:31.800 --> 48:37.800]  to pass laws legalizing it.
[48:37.800 --> 48:39.800]  Retroactively.
[48:39.800 --> 48:41.800]  See, nobody's house is safe.
[48:41.800 --> 48:45.800]  Nobody's property is safe under a fascist system.
[48:45.800 --> 48:46.800]  And that's what this is.
[48:46.800 --> 48:49.800]  Politically, for the elite, they're in a fascist system
[48:49.800 --> 48:51.800]  where they're still free market,
[48:51.800 --> 48:53.800]  but government decides winners and losers.
[48:53.800 --> 48:56.800]  And the corporations then put their people in
[48:56.800 --> 48:58.800]  to shut down their competition.
[48:58.800 --> 49:00.800]  And then throughout the chain,
[49:00.800 --> 49:03.800]  anyone working for government or major corporations
[49:03.800 --> 49:07.800]  ends up being like the new nobility who is above the law
[49:07.800 --> 49:11.800]  and we go back to pre-Magnacarta Battle of Runnymede,
[49:11.800 --> 49:16.800]  1215, where the people got together
[49:16.800 --> 49:19.800]  and had the king captured him at the battle
[49:19.800 --> 49:22.800]  and said, you signed the Magna Carta
[49:22.800 --> 49:26.800]  or we're going to cut your head off right now.
[49:26.800 --> 49:28.800]  You are not going to let your lords rape our daughters
[49:28.800 --> 49:29.800]  whenever they feel like it.
[49:29.800 --> 49:31.800]  You're not going to let your sheriffs kill our people
[49:31.800 --> 49:33.800]  whenever they want the cops.
[49:33.800 --> 49:35.800]  You are going to respect us.
[49:35.800 --> 49:37.800]  You can't come in our house without a warrant.
[49:37.800 --> 49:42.800]  You've got to have a jury, a grand jury on all these issues.
[49:42.800 --> 49:46.800]  Then they had a decade-long war to enforce it.
[49:46.800 --> 49:49.800]  So when I talk about 1776 worldwide,
[49:49.800 --> 49:52.800]  I'm not attacking England.
[49:52.800 --> 49:55.800]  1776 came out of England.
[49:55.800 --> 49:57.800]  Those Englishmen that were in the colonies
[49:57.800 --> 50:00.800]  knew their rights that their fathers and grandfathers
[50:00.800 --> 50:04.800]  had fought and died for in the old country.
[50:04.800 --> 50:06.800]  That's where all the freedom comes from,
[50:06.800 --> 50:08.800]  is England, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:08.800 --> 50:09.800]  Now it's a great tyranny.
[50:09.800 --> 50:11.800]  It's what's so sad.
[50:11.800 --> 50:15.800]  1776, I had people, 3,000 of them chanting,
[50:15.800 --> 50:19.800]  1776, north of London, out front the Bilderberg building.
[50:19.800 --> 50:21.800]  When I gave that speech and explained that,
[50:21.800 --> 50:23.800]  the history of it.
[50:23.800 --> 50:25.800]  It's 1776 worldwide.
[50:25.800 --> 50:28.800]  It's about accountability.
[50:28.800 --> 50:30.800]  It's about due process.
[50:30.800 --> 50:33.800]  And when the system doesn't have it, it's over.
[50:33.800 --> 50:35.800]  And that's what torture is about.
[50:35.800 --> 50:38.800]  Sticking a fork in us, openly torturing to get fake confessions,
[50:38.800 --> 50:42.800]  to create spies that have been tortured into submission.
[50:42.800 --> 50:46.800]  And it's also to be used against us to create fear.
[50:46.800 --> 50:49.800]  And that's what this is, a whole giant sickening whitewash
[50:49.800 --> 50:51.800]  where they make it political.
[50:51.800 --> 50:53.800]  We're now, if you're against torture, you support Obama,
[50:53.800 --> 50:56.800]  when Obama is continuing the torture.
[50:56.800 --> 50:58.800]  We'll be back with more details.
[50:58.800 --> 51:03.800]  Stay with us.
[51:29.800 --> 51:31.800]  Hey, Boomer.
[51:31.800 --> 51:34.800]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[51:34.800 --> 51:36.800]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[51:36.800 --> 51:38.800]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[51:38.800 --> 51:40.800]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system
[51:40.800 --> 51:43.800]  cleans out the bad stuff and leaks only pure, delicious water.
[51:43.800 --> 51:46.800]  I know, right? You love it too.
[51:46.800 --> 51:48.800]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too. Let's go get some.
[51:48.800 --> 51:53.800]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[51:53.800 --> 51:58.800]  That's 877-886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[52:24.800 --> 52:26.800]  It's yours free.
[52:26.800 --> 52:28.800]  Pay only shipping and handling.
[52:28.800 --> 52:31.800]  Just call 1-800-852-1820.
[52:31.800 --> 52:35.800]  In clinical trials, the ingredient in Superbeta Prostate
[52:35.800 --> 52:37.800]  was shown to reduce urges to urinate,
[52:37.800 --> 52:40.800]  improve bladder emptying, reduce waking at night to urinate,
[52:40.800 --> 52:42.800]  and improve quality of life.
[52:42.800 --> 52:46.800]  This Superbeta Prostate free offer is for listeners of this station.
[52:46.800 --> 52:48.800]  But it won't last.
[52:48.800 --> 52:52.800]  Don't wait. Just call 1-800-852-1820.
[52:52.800 --> 52:55.800]  That's 1-800-852-1820.
[52:55.800 --> 53:23.800]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[53:25.800 --> 53:32.800]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[53:55.800 --> 54:00.800]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[54:25.800 --> 54:30.800]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[54:55.800 --> 55:00.800]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[55:25.800 --> 55:30.800]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[55:55.800 --> 55:59.800]  The idea that patriotism is going along with torture,
[55:59.800 --> 56:02.800]  and they play that parlor trick of saying,
[56:02.800 --> 56:05.800]  Obama is releasing this report with Feinstein
[56:05.800 --> 56:09.800]  to blame Republicans and to make himself look good.
[56:09.800 --> 56:12.800]  And that's absolutely true.
[56:12.800 --> 56:15.800]  The difference is though, bipartisanly,
[56:15.800 --> 56:17.800]  they're all involved in it together as we show
[56:17.800 --> 56:19.800]  with the NDAA, the Patriot Act,
[56:19.800 --> 56:22.800]  and folks, it's continuing.
[56:22.800 --> 56:24.800]  I've talked to the active duty soldiers,
[56:24.800 --> 56:27.800]  and it's come out in the news.
[56:27.800 --> 56:30.800]  They are now handing them over like they did pre-911
[56:30.800 --> 56:34.800]  to third parties in Jordan and Romania and Poland
[56:34.800 --> 56:38.800]  and Ukraine and Egypt.
[56:38.800 --> 56:40.800]  Though Egypt doesn't trust the U.S. anymore
[56:40.800 --> 56:42.800]  and isn't doing it.
[56:42.800 --> 56:48.800]  And mainly, it's not about getting answers from bad guys.
[56:48.800 --> 56:53.800]  It is about setting the precedent,
[56:53.800 --> 56:56.800]  creating cadres of U.S. military and others
[56:56.800 --> 56:59.800]  that will torture people.
[56:59.800 --> 57:03.800]  And believe me, ladies and gentlemen, it goes on.
[57:03.800 --> 57:06.800]  Now, it's true that all the major studies show
[57:06.800 --> 57:08.800]  that promising to give somebody money
[57:08.800 --> 57:11.800]  or to take care of their kids or to give them lenient treatment
[57:11.800 --> 57:13.800]  works better than torture.
[57:13.800 --> 57:15.800]  But torture does work in some cases.
[57:15.800 --> 57:18.800]  You put a gun to somebody's head or start chopping their fingers off.
[57:18.800 --> 57:21.800]  They'll start talking.
[57:21.800 --> 57:26.800]  But it's a greater evil to have something like that going on
[57:26.800 --> 57:29.800]  because it will be deployed against innocent people,
[57:29.800 --> 57:32.800]  and it does lead to absolute hell on earth in every case.
[57:32.800 --> 57:36.800]  That's why the Communists and the Nazis and everybody else uses it.
[57:36.800 --> 57:40.800]  And that's why America supposedly didn't use torture.
[57:40.800 --> 57:42.800]  And I've read the history books,
[57:42.800 --> 57:45.800]  both the British, the French, and the colonial.
[57:45.800 --> 57:51.800]  George Washington would hang you,
[57:51.800 --> 57:53.800]  would have you court-martialed, if it was found guilty,
[57:53.800 --> 57:56.800]  you'd be hung if you raped somebody, if you pillaged,
[57:56.800 --> 58:00.800]  if you looted, and if you tortured.
[58:00.800 --> 58:05.800]  Because you had to have the moral high ground.
[58:05.800 --> 58:09.800]  And that's why he was so respected.
[58:09.800 --> 58:14.800]  And the British, who engaged in some of the atrocities,
[58:14.800 --> 58:17.800]  nothing compared to what you see nowadays,
[58:17.800 --> 58:21.800]  turned a lot of the colonies against him with atrocities.
[58:21.800 --> 58:25.800]  So in the end game, it's about demonizing America long term
[58:25.800 --> 58:28.800]  as global government comes in, we're the country that tortures.
[58:28.800 --> 58:31.800]  We're the country that has the racial problems, blah, blah, blah.
[58:31.800 --> 58:34.800]  A.K.A. the U.N. is the savior.
[58:34.800 --> 58:38.800]  So that's what torture is really all about, setting America up.
[58:38.800 --> 58:42.800]  Us being corrupted, losing the moral high ground, we should all reject it.
[58:42.800 --> 58:45.800]  On penalty of your soul, reject it.
[58:45.800 --> 59:14.800]  That's what torture is really all about.
[59:15.800 --> 59:37.800]  We're the country that has the moral high ground.
[59:37.800 --> 01:00:06.800]  We're the country that has the moral high ground.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:35.800]  We're the country that has the moral high ground.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.800]  See, that's how they set it up.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.800]  Oh, if you're against torture, you're for Obama or al-Qaeda,
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.800]  then our own government's funding.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.800]  When the jihadis are the most famous for torturing people, period.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.800]  So they have no moral standing.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:57.800]  That's why the media will go, oh, look, the terrorists now are against torture.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.800]  We all had better be for it.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.800]  But what about the lying?
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.800]  We were told the torture wasn't going on.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.800]  We were told the NSA wasn't spying on us.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.800]  We were told there weren't any cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:19.800]  We were told, we were told, we were told, we were told, lie after lie after lie.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:24.800]  In fact, I think we have it in the ministry.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.800]  It's got a liner.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.800]  It's lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.800]  So you still think jet fuel brought down the World Trade Centers?
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.800]  We're on a mission that you'll never forget.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.800]  It's an important piece when I play that sometime today.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.800]  We also have the ministry's new world order.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.800]  What we're talking about is good and evil, right and wrong.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.800]  A new world order.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.800]  A new world order where the narcotics are shipped in, laundered by the big banks,
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.800]  and then when the low-level dealers or the users get caught, they get thrown in giant prisons
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.800]  on record owned by the very big banks running and laundering the drugs
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:13.800]  and even leasing and owning as Bloomberg was forced to report the aircraft.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.800]  I've talked to folks in the military from Joint Task Force Six and Fort Bliss and others,
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.800]  and they'll sit there watching drug aircraft, big ones come in,
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.800]  and they'll be ordered to leave that one alone, leave that one alone.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.800]  That's one of ours now.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.800]  Now we're going to stop that little one coming in right there.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.800]  Get ready to follow that one.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.800]  There'll be 18-wheelers coming across.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.800]  They tell the board patrol, national security, let this one through.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.800]  And then they'll stop, you know, a car with some kids with a half ounce of marijuana
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.800]  and throw the book at them, and we all sit here naively.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.800]  I mean, it's economics. It's 101.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:58.800]  That if drugs are legal and nobody's using them in 1930 and you've just lost alcohol prohibition
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.800]  that you're making all this money off of, what do you do?
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.800]  You make narcotics and stuff illegal and you start pushing them
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.800]  so you can make bigger profits off the black market.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:15.800]  I mean, this is not rocket science, but apparently the average American still doesn't get it.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:22.800]  16 years after the CIA fully declassified with their inspector general report,
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.800]  I remember watching him testify on C-SPAN, and I thought, man, the war on drugs will stop now
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:33.800]  because the CIA inspector general just admitted they bring most of the drugs in.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.800]  But they promised to stop, of course.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.800]  And it wasn't even hardly on the news.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.800]  And then I'd mention it and go, oh, shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:48.800]  There wasn't an inspector general of the CIA and they didn't go on C-SPAN
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.800]  and they didn't testify to Congress.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:56.800]  And I remember back in, like, 1996 on air, people calling and go, there is no NSA.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.800]  The government doesn't listen to us illegally, Cooke.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.800]  There is no counsel on foreign relations.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.800]  The Federal Reserve is federal.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.800]  I heard everything but that the moon was made of cheese.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.800]  So believe me, we've come a long way where this is all known now.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.800]  The only question is, what do we do about it?
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.800]  Well, we don't let the globalists start a civil war.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800]  They're trying to start.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800]  We don't want things to get violent.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:31.800]  We don't want to have the just-of-ground-level police scapegoat as the source of all our problems,
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.800]  the fount of the problem.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.800]  We want to reform them.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.800]  We want to identify the globalists, the big central banks that have pulled this off,
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.800]  that want racial and political divides in this country with a dumb-down population
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.800]  so the social engineers can continue on with business as usual.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.800]  Coming up, we're going to look at how they balkanized and divided the public
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.800]  in the name of reform in South Africa and more.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:19.800]  Stay with us.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:36.800]  We're going to look at how they balkanized and divided the public.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:03.800]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.800]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.800]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:14.800]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.800]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.800]  But for how long?
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:26.800]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:55.800]  Just won't quit.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.800]  3-3-1-3-9.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.800]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.800]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:38.800]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic proprietary forms of Vitamin B12.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.800]  Bringing you a true nutraceutical quality, Vitamin B12.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.800]  Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift.

[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.800]  That's infowarslife.com before December 17.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:01.800]  We're by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:08.800]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:19.800]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:24.800]  We're going to the Reverend C.L. Bryant and Pastor Rodney Howard Brown
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.800]  to discuss from their perspectives one a white pastor formerly from South Africa
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.800]  or in South Africa, the other a black pastor here in America,
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.800]  what the racial manipulation is really all about and where they think it's going.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:44.800]  And one of the pastors wanted us to play, I think it's a C.L. Bryant.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.800]  This clip I hadn't seen until this morning, but I've seen similar clips
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.800]  where a racist black lady wants water, world star hip hop.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.800]  World star hip hop is a super viral hip hop site for those that don't know.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.800]  Some of our videos on there got as many as 3-4 million views.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:06.800]  And this latest video dovetails with the famous lady out of Florida who had like 16 kids.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.800]  She goes, somebody needs to give me some money. I'm going to have more kids.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.800]  I'm only giving 16 checks. I need more.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.800]  And it's just this crazy disconnect that it's racist.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.800]  If everything isn't given to you, this is the true slavery of the welfare state
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.800]  that was designed to do this on record.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.800]  So we're going to break that down with Reverend C.L. Bryant of clbriant.net
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:36.800]  and Pastor Rodney Brown of Revival.com.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.800]  Revival.com. That's a great website name.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:47.800]  So before we go any further though, I wanted to get into this short clip and newscast piece.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:53.800]  74 year old woman wins gunfight with criminal thugs neighbor blamed store owner
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.800]  for defending herself against robbers.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.800]  And this happened in Springdale, Arkansas this past weekend.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.800]  We see stuff like this every day that doesn't make national news.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.800]  But when it does make national news, the system criticizes people.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.800]  The good news is the head of Interpol says people should be armed to stop radical Islamist.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.800]  And the police chief of Detroit says folks should be armed.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.800]  And the sheriff of Milwaukee says everybody should be armed.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.800]  By the way, all three of those police chiefs are black.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.800]  So that's certainly good news.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.800]  They try to make it politically correct and racist for black people to have guns
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.800]  to protect themselves from criminals.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.800]  So again, don't like Obamacare, you're racist.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.800]  Want to own guns, you're racist.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.800]  Don't want to accept open borders, you're racist.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:43.800]  They use this as a weapon to beat people over the head while promoting racism.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.800]  But let's play this clip and then go to our two guests.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.800]  Here it is.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.800]  Yes, Katelyn.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.800]  The robbery happened here at the CNS gun and pawn shop on Thompson Avenue around nine this morning.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.800]  Two men attempted to rob the store carrying semi-automatic pistols.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.800]  And again, police do have both suspects in custody.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.800]  This surveillance video shows 25-year-old Marcus Gould and 20-year-old Leon Robinson
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.800]  coming into the store and looking around for a few minutes.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.800]  They then split up and pulled guns on both the man and woman working.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:17.800]  The woman reached into her waistband and pulled out a gun, shooting Gould.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.800]  He shot back, but did not hit the woman,
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.800]  instead hitting the books just in front of her.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.800]  It looks like he was hit in the exchange of gunfire,
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.800]  and there's also blood in that same area.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.800]  The severity of that injury, I don't know.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.800]  Police say Robinson took Gould to Sparks Hospital in Fort Smith.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.800]  That's where they arrested both men this evening.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.800]  Across the street from the pawn shop is Scottish Inn and Suites.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.800]  Owner Cal Gondy was at work this morning when it happened.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.800]  When I came out in the office, I saw the ambulance coming.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.800]  A lot of police officers came in as well, and the detective were here too.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.800]  Gondy says this isn't the first time the store has been targeted,
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.800]  or the first time the owners have shot back.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.800]  I'm really upset about it.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.800]  Owning a gun is okay, but firing just in heavy traffic.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.800]  I have a family here.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.800]  All these business owners, all of them have families.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.800]  Mr. Gondy, idiot.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.800]  It is not right to...
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.800]  They need to understand their business owner as well as their neighbors too.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:22.800]  Police say both men faced charges of attempted capital murder and aggravated robbery.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.800]  Gould is in the hospital recovering while Robinson is on his way
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.800]  to the Washington County Detention Center.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.800]  All right. Again, that's out of News 5 there in Arkansas and Springdale.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.800]  A good report overall.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.800]  They're not the ones that said that idiotic statement.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.800]  Bullets didn't hurt that guy's place.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.800]  I mean, what are you supposed to do? Just be killed.
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:42.800]  But I want to ask this question.
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:46.800]  What type of morons, talk about Common Core having its effect,
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:55.800]  would rob a gun store? It's like trying to rob cops or a donut shop full of cops.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.800]  What is wrong with people?
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.800]  It is just so mindless.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.800]  C.L. Bryant, who is done...
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.800]  I'm not going to cover all the amazing things he's done,
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.800]  but he has the big hit film, Independent Filmmaker of the Documentary Runaway Slave.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.800]  He writes a column for SB Magazine and is the host of America on the Edge with C.L. Bryant.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.800]  C.L. Bryant.net.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.800]  And we're joined by a gentleman he recommended,
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:26.800]  Pastor Rodney Brown, born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, grew up in eastern Cape.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:33.800]  Rodney and his wife came to America with only $300 and four suitcases with their children at age seven.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.800]  Under the banner of Revival Ministries International, they traveled 46 weeks a year
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.800]  holding weekly meetings in cities across North America and around the world.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:47.800]  And Pastor at Church in Tampa, Florida, the river at Tampa Bay, founded in 96.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:53.800]  And Pastor at Brown also travels frequently to D.C. to meet with congressmen and senators on both sides of the aisle
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.800]  to discuss global banking system and other pressing issues.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.800]  So that's the reason he's on with us, but also to give his perspective from what happened in South Africa,
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:07.800]  how they take a real wrong, but then use it to bring in basically communism as my view.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.800]  They take one of you and replace it with another.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.800]  But we're going to discuss it all in the balance of the hour with both gentlemen.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.800]  C.L. Bryant, good to have you back with us.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:24.800]  Always good to be on with you, Alex. Thank you so much for having us both on again.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.800]  Thank you. We're going to get to your colleague in a moment to get his take on things.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:34.800]  But first off, Ferguson, the whole state of the world, now, you know, the tragic death of New York
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:42.800]  with a cop chokes the man to death. I mean, seriously, there's some real problems on both sides of the issue here.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.800]  But what do you think Obama and the Justice Department are really trying to do?
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:52.800]  What they're trying to do, Alex, is create an underclass here in this country by their actions
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:58.800]  and they're using emotionalism of skin color in order to do it.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:04.800]  Personal responsibility is something that is totally gone out of the window.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:12.800]  In both cases with both of these gentlemen who tragically lost their lives and both of these men who tragically lost their lives,
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:17.800]  it was not their skin color that got them killed, it was their conduct.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:27.800]  And in the case of Michael Brown, obviously, his last moments on earth were documented as to what he was participating in.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.800]  And that was a strong armed robbery.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.800]  Lots of color of his skin caused him to do that. It was his conduct.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:45.800]  And in the case of New York City where a daughter was choked to death, unfortunately, the policies of Mayor Bloomberg is what got him killed.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:53.800]  The taxation on the cigarette and that type of thing is what got this man killed, not his skin color.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:16:02.800]  Well, that's a point. People don't look at that. I tell you, the Democrats seem to be putting everything they can behind racial politics, identity politics right now.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.800]  Do you think it's working?
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:13.800]  Oh, they've been very successful in doing it, especially with a class that is uninformed and broke.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:24.800]  Most of those people that are out on the street protesting and so forth, except for the occupiers, the Wall Street occupiers type, who are probably trust fund babies.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:34.800]  But most of those people, black people who are out on the street doing the protesting and all of that, I would like to know how many of them are receiving government checks?
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:44.800]  How much of this are we funding ourselves because we're giving them government checks to be out there carrying and laying down in the aisles of Macy?
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:55.800]  You've been to New York, I'm sure, during Christmas time, and Macy's hired something like 65,000 people. I'm sure a lot of them are minorities during the Christmas holiday.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:01.800]  The only people that they're hurting of themselves and people who really want to work.
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:08.800]  That's what Charles Barkley said about all this. But the media plays into it as well.
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:18.800]  Watching CNN and MSNBC act like brown with some type of angel, there are a lot of real cases of police misconduct they can focus in on, but they don't do that.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:23.800]  They focus in on the ones where the poster child for it is a strong armed thug.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:32.800]  It's tragic to see how they are blasting the police in this situation. Barkley brought up a great point.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:45.800]  I really like him speaking his mind, but the fact is that more than 95% of all police contact with civilians end very, very well.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:55.800]  The only time usually that you hear a police officer going awry is in a situation like this. Have there been historically in the past?
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:05.800]  And I'm going back 40, 50 years where there was need to, in the South in particular, to be wary of police officers? Of course there was.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:15.800]  But in these days and times, we have to consider the alternative, as Barkley pointed out, if the police were to go away.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.800]  That is what we have focused on.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.800]  We're going to go to break here in a moment and come back with both of you.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:29.800]  And I want you guys to speak about what you want to get into that you think is most important instead of me just asking the questions because you both have such a wealth of knowledge.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:34.800]  But tell us about your colleague as we go out to break and then we'll come back and talk to him some.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.800]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is a man of great courage.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:54.800]  And what is beautiful about he and I, and we team up on some occasions, the visual effect that you see of a South African born Caucasian and myself being a black American citizen.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:01.800]  Both of us now citizens of the United States is very powerful because we both are men of the cloth, men of God.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:08.800]  And Alex, we are, in fact, taking on this particular issue in this country.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.800]  And I believe that we're doing it in a very powerful way.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.800]  He and his way, I and my way.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.800]  And of course, he'll do his own horn as to how he's doing it.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:27.800]  And I do believe that he has a powerful ministry and I'm very happy to be friends with him and certainly glad to be on with you and him on this show today.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.800]  Absolutely. Revival.com.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.800]  Pastor, we're going to break here in about 10 minutes.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.800]  I'm going to skip this network break because it's so important.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:39.800]  I want to get into the banking with you later to understand, you know, what they're trying to distract us from.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:46.800]  But Pastor, with your unique perspective from South Africa, looking at what's now happening here in the U.S.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.800]  What do you think is really going on?
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.800]  First of all, Alex, let me say it's an honor to be on with you.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.800]  I listen to you all the time and thank you for your voice.
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.800]  Thank you. In a world full of lies and deceit.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.800]  But it's the age old story of dividing conquer.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:11.800]  Like in South Africa, what people don't know, the beers funded the war in Angola to stop the diamonds from coming out of Angola.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.800]  So here you've got 1 million land mines in Angola.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800]  They stir it up as a racial thing.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.800]  And when in reality, South Africa does not own its gold.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.800]  It does not own its diamonds.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:25.800]  The beers owns the diamonds and Angola American owns the gold.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:31.800]  And that was all done by a man called Jan Smuts, who was Prime Minister of South Africa.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.800]  Went to Cambridge, was going to fall out of university.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:39.800]  He was conscripted by a wealthy man, Turkey, on his wing.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:46.800]  He went back to Kimberley, secured the diamond fields for the beers, went back to the transfer, pretended to oppose the British,
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.800]  but actually secured the gold fields for Angola American.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.800]  And he wrote down the Paul Moore with the Queen.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:59.800]  What is an Africana, a white Africana, writing down the Paul Moore with the Queen of England if he didn't sell out to the system?
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:08.800]  So basically, a high treason was committed in our country by a man who was supposed to be the leader of our nation,
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.800]  who sold out our diamonds and our gold.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.800]  And of course, if they get white and black to fight each other,
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:19.800]  then while we're fighting each other and everybody's distracted, they steal everything that we have.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:25.800]  I was just in South Africa and I was on national television across the nation and I challenged everybody.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.800]  I challenged my African brothers.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.800]  I said, you've had your own government for 20 years.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.800]  Is it any better?
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.800]  Absolutely not.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.800]  It's more unemployment.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:40.800]  There's more trouble there right now because basically they can put the puppets in power,
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.800]  but he who pays the piper calls the tune.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:50.800]  And so until we deal with the money system of the globe, the politicians, the next one will be out of office.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:56.800]  The next one will be in and he will pay to the highest, play to the highest bidder.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:02.800]  As in America right now, we've got $4 billion a year coming through the hands of the lobby groups,
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.800]  into the hands of the Congress and the Senate.
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:12.800]  And it is stuff like this that just angers me and I'm going to do whatever I can in every way possible
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.800]  to speak out against it and to challenge those in power that they need to repent and get right with God.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.800]  It's almost like people have lost the fear of God and they don't realize that they're going to stand before God
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.800]  and give an account of what they've done on the earth and especially with humanity.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.800]  Well, that's it.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.800]  We know that civilizations go through cycles.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:34.800]  We're going into a very decadent part of the cycle right now.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:41.800]  The question is how bad will it get before people realize that the wages of corruption, the wages of center death,
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:48.800]  and we're talking about political corruption, social corruption for those that don't know about what happened in Africa.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:53.800]  From my layman research, there were certainly problems, but it wasn't just black against white.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:23:00.800]  It was ANC against Zulu and Africana against the British and people don't know about the Boer War.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:05.800]  They don't know about Cecil Rhodes, but from what I've researched, it's very simple.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:12.800]  The big British interest, something the British people, came in over the last 115 years, took over the gold,
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:20.800]  took over the diamonds, took over all the major resources, and then to defeat the more indigenous and the British,
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.800]  the Dutch who'd been there first, they started playing different tribes off against each other,
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:31.800]  and then they just sent Mandela in the Communist to then pose as this heavenly savior because the television told us so.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:36.800]  And now what the murder rates about five times what it was, unemployment's almost double what it was.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:45.800]  I've seen the numbers. I mean, I've even seen polls in South Africa where the majority of blacks in many areas want to go back.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:51.800]  Well, I wouldn't go back to apartheid. I would try to go to something better where the people actually get the resources,
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.800]  and that's exactly what's happening here.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:01.800]  What's happening, too, is some places 65% unemployment. But let me just tell you, Alex, the people are waking up.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:08.800]  A former head of the South African Reserve Bank just came up with a book called Inside the South African Reserve Bank,
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:15.800]  It's Origin and Secret Exposed, and there's a whole group of people that are rising up to sue the South African Reserve Bank
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:21.800]  for its money creation and what's going on. And I found a group in England. I was just in London last week.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.800]  I met with a group called Positive Money, and they're doing the same thing for the first time.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.800]  In 170 years, British Parliament heard about money creation.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.800]  So I would say that people are getting themselves in the corner and they're coming out.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.800]  I just don't know what it's going to take the American people to wake up and realize what's going on.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.800]  It's like I talked to many ministers. They don't want to listen to what I'm saying,
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:54.800]  but I promise you that what's taking place right now is all it and what they want to do is create the place to be total lawlessness
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:01.800]  and to have a situation where we can't trust the police. Then they're going to bring in the NATO troops and we are going to martial law.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:09.800]  I mean, that's the next step on the agenda, apart from going house to house and gun confiscation, all driven by United Nations Agenda 21.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.800]  And so I find myself, you know, obviously we go around, we preach the gospel.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.800]  We went into Washington, D.C. back in July. C.L. Bryan came and joined me.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:23.800]  Fifteen nights, I preached the gospel, 400 yards from the White House.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:29.800]  I exposed the whole system, the Federal Reserve, the IRS, and all the wickedness that's going on.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.800]  And then during the day, we went into the Congress and the Senate.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.800]  And I met with many people both sides of the aisle.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:43.800]  One Democratic senator looked at me and he said to me, sir, when you come to Washington, you have to decide, are you going to sell your soul?
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.800]  Then he looked at me and said, I have not sold my soul.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.800]  But he said, sir, we are an industrial military complex and we are run by offshore banks.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:57.800]  And then another congressman looked at me when I told him what's going on with the global money system.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.800]  He said, how do you know all this?
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:05.800]  He said, you and probably 10 congressmen in America know what's happening in the money system.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800]  And here's what he said to me.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.800]  He said, when it all collapses, he said, there will be no food in the stores.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.800]  And he said, within 12 hours, there will be riots.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.800]  And he said, we will go to martial law.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:20.800]  So there are people on the inside of the system that are trying to do their best.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:28.800]  They just don't know what to do because obviously the whole system is controlled by our wonderful Federal Reserve.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:32.800]  Let me just inject here and then get CL Bryant's take on this.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.800]  The big picture of why they're playing us off against each other.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:43.800]  They have engineered a collapse so that they can break us fully and basically force us all onto welfare.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.800]  That is Agent 21.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.800]  That is Cloward and Piven.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.800]  That's the model they've used in the black community.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:52.800]  It's what the social engineers, Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood want.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.800]  They are diabolical demons.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.800]  And the minute people realize that is the minute we start changing this.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.800]  And the same British model that took over South Africa is now taking over America.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.800]  It's multinational.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:10.800]  And as you said, when I talked to congressmen and senators privately,
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.800]  a lot of them that you don't hear on the show, folks, I'll just leave it at that.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.800]  And generals, they go, no, you're absolutely right.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.800]  What you say is what's going on.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.800]  And they said, if the American people only knew, it's the ignorance that allows it.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.800]  That's why we're here.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:35.800]  Pastor Bryant, your take on what Mr. Brown was just speaking about and your overall take on any hope for this country.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:42.800]  This is why I wanted you to, I wanted to introduce you to Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:55.800]  It's because this view, your view, my view, these are the views that, in fact, can enlighten and save our nation, our republic.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:10.800]  Black people don't realize that they have been a test case, a test-to-case for what is happening for 40 years, 50 years.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:20.800]  There is an underclass, as has been created in South Africa, that is being created right now by the Obama policy.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:28.800]  Obama was, in fact, a pawn of public of those who want to bring this about.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:32.800]  He's failed in everything else but this.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:39.800]  Even the amnesty thing that is coming about is, in fact, a part of a design.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:43.800]  It is a design to bring America to its knees.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:49.800]  And black people need to understand, especially those clowns who are rioting in the streets,
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:58.800]  that if, in fact, there is any other place on this globe where they would want to be black, then they need to go there.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:05.800]  And Rodney Howard Brown, Pastor Brown, can certainly tell you that they do not want to go to South Africa.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:13.800]  And there's no other place that I can possibly name that black people would experience the benefits, the wealth,
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:18.800]  even if you're poor, that they have being able to experience in America.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:29.800]  And so my take on all of this is that there is an awakening that must take place in this country,
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:37.800]  or, in fact, there will be partial law and there will be an underclass that will help drive it,
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:43.800]  and Al Sharpton and his minions, people like him, even Eric Holder.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.800]  They're in the driver's seat. Stay there, see y'all, Brian.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:30:00.800]  Coming right back to you, powerful information.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.800]  The vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years,
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.800]  and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.800]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.800]  No needles, no injections.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.800]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:39.800]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic, proprietary forms of vitamin B12,
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.800]  bringing you a true nutraceutical quality vitamin B12.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:48.800]  Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift. Secure your Secret 12 formula before December 17.

[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:07.800]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.800]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail. Make this year different.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:17.800]  By equipping yourself with oxy-powder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:25.800]  Using super oxygenation, oxy-powder, available through infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:31.800]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used oxy-powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:37.800]  Even infowarsnightly news director Rob Dew has been using oxy-powder with incredible success.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:43.800]  Took it that first day and that took it for six more days after that. 12 pounds melted off. In about a week, I'd say a week. Seven days.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:48.800]  2015 can be different. Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.800]  Oxy-powder flushes it out. Secure your oxy-powder at infowarslife.com.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:59.800]  That's infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:05.800]  As the year is coming to a close, we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.800]  We take a step back and thank God for what we have.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.800]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:17.800]  At Diamond Gusset, we are celebrating the brush fires of liberty that are spreading across this great nation.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:20.800]  Another thing we are celebrating is you.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:26.800]  Without the valued listeners of Alex Jones and our loyal customers, we wouldn't be here today.
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:29.800]  We offer a wonderful online shopping experience.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:35.800]  If you receive a pair that doesn't fit, send them back and we'll exchange them at no cost to you.

[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.800]  And paying no attention to political correctness, Diamond Gusset wants to wish you all a merry Christmas.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:33:00.800]  Thanks for believing in our dream, the original 100% American made Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:30.800]  Well, he helped found three different tea parties.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:36.800]  He's a successful radio host, very successful pastor, author, researcher, filmmaker, C.L. Bryant.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:39.800]  His name is C.L. Bryant.net.
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:42.800]  And he's my type of activist for freedom.
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:48.800]  I mean, he's out there on every media platform he can and he's reaching millions of people with the truth.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:52.800]  And if more of us start doing that, it's game over.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.800]  It's game over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:00.800]  And then we can see real prosperity and people really getting along and really coming together.
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:10.800]  Makes me so angry, the race baiting and the division and trying to push people into the globalist run CIA, hip hop, gangster culture,
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:19.800]  and the whole rebellious establishment music culture, it's been declassified that they want to wreck our youth.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:28.800]  Not the government in general, but the social engineering elements of the private central banks that are in control.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:34.800]  J.P. Morgan Goldman Sachs, De Beers that he was listing earlier that has a worldwide diamond monopoly.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:44.800]  You know why there are so many movies where there's villains in Africa, black villains that have black slaves in the Congo or wherever,
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.800]  mining diamonds and gold.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  Now, in some cases, there's stuff like that.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.800]  I've studied it.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:54.800]  Had documentary filmmakers, mercenaries on.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.800]  And I want his colleague to correct me if I'm wrong, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:08.800]  But in most movies, when you see Leonardo DiCaprio finding out that there's an evil African country secretly selling diamonds and their blood diamonds,
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:19.800]  there are only blood diamonds when somebody in a country or a region is mining diamonds on their own or through a government to sell them on the market.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:27.800]  And De Beers and the Oppenheimers on record will send in helicopter gunships to take you out just outside of law.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:31.800]  I remember an article in 99 in New Yorker magazine bragging about it.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.800]  My dad on the side, just because he went to college with some of them,
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:45.800]  knew a major South African family that was in the diamond business was one of the only families ever to develop a diamond mine outside of De Beers.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:52.800]  And then Clinton ordered an environmental zone in Arkansas and they bought them out for $4 billion.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:56.800]  My dad's friends developed those mines in Arkansas.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:02.800]  There's diamonds all over the place. They're semi-precious. They're like agates.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:07.800]  I mean, they're near worthless, but people will pay a five-year salary to get their wife one.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:14.800]  It's all mind control. And I'm kind of segueing off, but it shows the type of emotionalism that goes on.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:21.800]  The real blood diamonds are the certified safe by the UN and De Beers.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:28.800]  That just shows the triumph of fraud over reality. They don't want Africa with its incredible resources to actually go to the Africans.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:34.800]  So every time some country starts building up, I mean, look at what they've done in different areas,
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:40.800]  kicking all the whites out with the UN there, promoting it because they want Africa to collapse.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.800]  I'm going to go back to Pastor Rodney Howard Brown of revival.com.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:53.800]  I wanted to have C.L. Bryant finish this point about Al Sharpton and Eric Holder and all of these guys who know exactly what they're doing.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:37:00.800]  I think you're about to say when there is martial law or a race war, if they can get it, that it's on their hands or I don't want to finish your sentence.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.800]  What were you about to say when the break cut you off, Pastor?
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:11.800]  When the break cut me off, there is a race war that is brewing and it's one that is by design of this government.
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:17.800]  And you have people under the guise of reverence, like Reverend Al Sharpton, who has never passed it.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.800]  Neither has Reverend Jesse Dax. I've passed the three churches.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:26.800]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is very successful in pastoring the river.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:37.800]  But the church itself, in so many cases, and Pastor Alex, in so many cases are complicit in their silence of what is going on.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:44.800]  They don't want to know. They're like the Austrian who, in fact, have their face at their head in the sand.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:58.800]  And they certainly don't want to tell their congregants what's going on because so many of them have actually sold their souls to the system in order to keep their doors open.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.800]  So they think.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:10.800]  You're right. We have a book available at infoorstore.com by Pastor Chuck Baldwin called Romans 13, written with his son as a constitutional lawyer.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.800]  And they use Romans 13 out of context.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:20.800]  If Romans 13 was believed in the context Hitler used it for, or our government uses it for pastors.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.800]  I'd like you to both comment on this.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:35.800]  Then Jesus should have followed his orders or the disciples or the folks in the fiery furnace of the lion's den should have done what government told him if all government is basically by God.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.800]  Boy, they've really twisted that, haven't they?
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.800]  Alex, there are fiery furnaces in front of us now.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:53.800]  And those who will bow down will, in fact, be trampled by the government system. And Pastor Brown and I have talked about this on so many occasions.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.800]  And here's a wealth, a wealth of knowledge and the grand scheme of things.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.800]  He's really able to pull it together.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:04.800]  I do want to yield to him at this point.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.800]  I really think people need to hear what he has to say.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:18.800]  You better, we'll have him back by himself, and you back by himself as well, Mr. Bryant. But sure, before we get into South Africa parallels how they don't let Africa have its own resources, any gold or diamonds by an African country is a blood diamond.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.800]  This is the type of word games they play.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.800]  I want you to comment on that.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.800]  Also, the martial law that C.L. Bryant says is coming.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:30.800]  But specifically, Romans 13, that was Hitler's favorite Bible passage.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:46.800]  And when you look at the passage that Hitler loved, when you look at the powers that are ordained here, when you look at that, Hitler was also very much into Darwinism.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:40:00.800]  Darwin was one of Hitler's favorite rings. Why? Because, undenounced, there's so many who pushed the present-day schools to the common core and all of that.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:18.800]  The problem was the racism, and we need to understand that so many things that are happening under the Obama administration are based on the fact that this man is also complicit with the racism that he claims to be so much against.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:32.800]  Well, that was the Margaret Sanger, Rockefeller, Darwinian eugenics plan. That's what it is by stealth. Absolutely. Going back to the other pastor, Howard Brown, your take on Romans 13 and then expanding.
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:43.800]  Well, I mean, I believe we need to stand up for righteousness as a man of God. If I see those in power breaking the law, then I'm going to go and get in their face.
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:51.800]  I mean, the bottom line is people in government are elected by us. They are there to serve us. We don't serve them. We don't bow down to them.
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:41:05.800]  When I walked into the Capitol and met with congressmen and senators in the House and the Senate, and I spoke direct to them. Some of them I had three or five minutes with, but I said, look, you might be out of office in four or five years.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:16.800]  I'm still going to be in the ministry. So I'm going to talk straight. I'm not here to be like. I'm not looking for your vote, but I'm here to warn you that we are on the brink of a total collapse of our society.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:27.800]  Here we've got $85 billion a month being sucked out of our nation through the offshore banking cartels propping up Wall Street. They are raping and pillaging our nation.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:35.800]  You've got 27 million African American babies aborted through Planned Parenthood, and no one says anything about it. They just leave it alone.
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:48.800]  So I believe that we have to stand up and come against the system that is wicked. I don't believe that because we Christians that we go lie down and just let them roll over us. Absolutely not.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:58.800]  If they think that we're going to be quiet, let me tell you right now, it'll be a cold day in hell with the devil saying frosty the snowman before I shut up. I'm not going to shut up.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:07.800]  And I am an American and I raise my hand to pledge to defend the Constitution, and that means the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, and I'll do whatever it takes.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:17.800]  So they should never have sworn me in as a citizen because you've got a problem now. You've got somebody who really believes in the Constitution and is going to stand up against tyranny.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:26.800]  And so I know that there's a group of ministers that once they hear they have what they call one Sunday I hear pulpit freedom Sunday.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:32.800]  So they called me and they said, would you like to join us? I said, no, every Sunday is pulpit freedom Sunday.
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:42.800]  I said, we are reaching into the inner cities, Alec, right here in the Tampa Bay area. Our crime rate in Hillsborough County is down 64%.
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:48.800]  According to the Tampa Police Department, the FBI, they don't know why, but we are going house to house. We're praying with people.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:57.800]  We're giving people opportunity except Jesus Christ, his Lord and Savior. We are raising all of our people to go out and then I bust people in from the inner cities.
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:09.800]  Our church is totally integrated and we have to reach the inner cities of America because this is the boiling pot that if the money system collapses, there'll be no food and the riots are going to happen.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:20.800]  And then we go to martial law, if not civil war, all those at the same time, because I know that the moment they go to martial law, that means the confiscation of the American Second Amendment.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:30.800]  And that ain't going to happen. No, we are the intolerant. I'm very passionate about it and very bold about it, but I really believe that.
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.800]  Well, you've got the floor. Keep elaborating the parallels you've seen in South Africa and now it's happening here today, Pastor.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:49.800]  Well, it's a whole bait and switch. So basically, while the American people are fighting each other, while they caught up with television, while they caught up in the NFL, NBA, American Idol, watching the movies, going to Starbucks,
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:44:05.800]  as long as they can go shopping at Walmart, all of their rights and privileges are being taken away. In South Africa, we've watched a total erosion of the people's rights under the really the cartel that runs the place.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:15.800]  There's nothing more than a mafioso operation and I'm going to be back the end of February and end of March and I'm going to be speaking to people in the government and really warning them.
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:23.800]  We can turn this thing around. I don't believe that this thing is too far gone in America. I believe that many people waking up. Alex, you have a very big audience.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:37.800]  You look what you did to Pierce Morgan. That was phenomenal. I thank God that you got rid of him. But I believe that we can see America turned around and the only hope for America is another great spiritual awakening.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:48.800]  In 1700s, if you look at the condition of America, it became a first great awakening. The 1800s was the same thing and I believe another spiritual great awakening will turn America back.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:45:00.800]  And that's what we are trusting for in South Africa and of course in the United Kingdom because every time people coming back to their spiritual roots and coming back to God, then it sets the new order back.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:13.800]  It sets the global agenda back and I'll just tell you, they're not ahead of the plan. They are behind. These guys are 10 to 15 years behind and they are getting impatient right now and they're trying to preempt something.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:20.800]  But we are praying. We've got a whole church praying. We have all night prayer meetings. We have a prayer chain. People are praying for America.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:30.800]  We're praying that whatever is hidden, whatever is done behind closed doors is leaked out and that the Lord unraveled the plan of the wicked over this nation.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:43.800]  And then I'm doing my best to mobilize the pastors to train their people, get them out of the system, get them off of the government aid, government support, get them off of the food stamp, getting everybody to grow their own food,
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:50.800]  get everybody onto organic food, get their own warm supply. I mean, we've got to...
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:58.800]  That's why they want to take culture and God away from us because then even if you're poor, you don't feel pathetic and won't give your soul over to the new world order.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:05.800]  They really do traffic in the souls of men. They really do want to shut our jobs down so people don't feel self-respectable.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:15.800]  They really want to promote thugism and ganchurism to ensnare our youth. I've talked to top people in MTV, top musicians and confirmed what's always been a rumor out there.
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:24.800]  It is so cold-blooded how the system wants to dumb us down so they can literally enslave, not just us physically, but our minds.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:30.800]  Is this modern system not slavery? Is clowered and piven not slavery?
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:38.800]  It's total slavery to the debt system. Every American, the moment you're born, you're part of the collateral of the system,
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:42.800]  which really, if you look at America basically on paper, we are a corporation.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.800]  So that's why they lose a couple of citizens. It's just collateral damage.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:55.800]  That's why we've got all the legals coming across our borders because they can make them legal citizens, put them on the system, get them to vote, change the Constitution.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:02.800]  And we have to, as Americans, as American citizens, we have to stand up and draw a line in the sand.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:08.800]  And I'm going back to Washington D.C. next July for eight days. I encourage people to come stand.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.800]  If you want to come speak Alec, you're welcome to come stand with me.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:15.800]  I'm right in the shadow of the White House, in the Constitution Hall.
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:22.800]  And I'm going into the Congress every day, the Senate, and really talking straight to these men that are in power.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:26.800]  We have to turn this thing around because the handwriting's on the wall.
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:33.800]  We stand on the brink of total collapse. And most people, they don't want to hear what I'm saying, but America's not ready for what's coming.
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:38.800]  In 99, I went to Madison Square Garden. I rented the garden for six weeks.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:46.800]  We had over 48,000 conversions, but I preached a message on the 30th of July, 99, there's a storm coming.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:52.800]  Talked about the rise of terrorism. Talked about nations plundered downfall of America as we speak.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.800]  Talked about the fact that America's not ready for what's coming.
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:59.800]  And then I asked the question, what would happen if a missile struck New York City?
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:04.800]  That was two years before 9-11, two years before those planes hit the towers.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:08.800]  I stood there at great cost to our ministry. We almost bankrupted our ministry.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:14.800]  That event cost us $6.7 million. But the Lord helped us and we came through the other side.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:20.800]  The event in DC cost us $1.2 million, but we paid care for that and God helped us do that.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:28.800]  And Alex, we are doing everything we can, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, mobilizing everybody to wake America up.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:35.800]  This is like deja vu. This is like Groundhog Day. Everything we saw happen in Southern Africa, we see happening here.
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:40.800]  The whole censorship of the media, the whole how the media just puts out the same dribble.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:44.800]  You can't believe one word that the media tell you.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:50.800]  And so I'm very glad about alternative media, about Impa Wars, PersonPlanet.com, Drudge Report,
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.800]  Broadbought News, and all of the alternative media that's out there.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:58.800]  Because we have to get the word out. We've got to wake the American people up.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:03.800]  And we've got to tell Americans they've got to cry out to God and come back before it's too late.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.800]  Because I promise you, let me just say this, I did a show a few weeks ago,
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:10.800]  and I talked about the camps that are being built.
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:14.800]  I received a call from a man in Kentucky, very wealthy businessman.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.800]  And he said to me, he said, I don't know what to tell you.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:20.800]  He said, but somebody told me to call you because you would understand.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:24.800]  He said, I'm a contractor. I do major developments.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:27.800]  And he said, some of my people work other jobs.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:31.800]  And he said, they just have connected gas to these gas chambers.
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.800]  He said, do you know anything about it?
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:39.800]  I said, look, I said anything's possible with the total corruption of the system.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:43.800]  And I mentioned that on the radio. I mean, we got attacked left, right, and center.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:48.800]  They said, how Brown says Obama's building concentration camps and gas chambers.
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:52.800]  Listen, it don't matter if it's Obama, the next president's going to do the same thing.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:56.800]  And the previous president, the last real president we had was John F. Kennedy.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.800]  And that's why they put a bullet in him because he's going to shut the system down.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:05.800]  Yes, Reagan came out the blue, but they put the old man Bush to watch him because he was the head of the CIA.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:11.800]  This whole thing is cooked. And you could see it when Mandela died on Air Force One hitting to South Africa.
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:15.800]  Yes, who's on Air Force One, the Bushes, the Clintons and the Obamas.
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.800]  What does that mean? It's a club. The whole thing is a club. The whole thing is cooked.
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:25.800]  And as long as Americans keep thinking, oh, I'm voting for my man and the Democrat and I vote for my man and the Republican,
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:31.800]  they both are the same. When are people going to wake up and realize that this is a government by the people,
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:36.800]  of the people, for the people, we the people, we must stand up and we must say no.
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:37.800]  You're not going to do this.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:42.800]  No, I hear you. It's clear we need to have Pastor Rodney Howard Brown of revival.com back on.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.800]  I owe C.L. Bryant for telling us to get him on. Man, this guy's on fire.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:49.800]  And so C.L. Bryant, that's amazing.
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:54.800]  Well, let's try to set some brush fires in the minds of many women everywhere to have a revival in this country.

[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:03.800]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:10.800]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate or issues with sex.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:17.800]  If this sounds familiar, call us now because we're shipping free bottles of Super Beta Prostate to listeners of this station.

[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:41.800]  improve bladder emptying, reduce waking at night to urinate, and improve quality of life.

[01:53:54.800 --> 01:54:15.800]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:24.800]  All right, our guest will be with us for a little bit in the next hour, and then we've got Dr. Steve Pritchett coming on about the torture report.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:29.800]  We're going to be deciphering what's really going on behind the scenes.
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:36.800]  Before we go any further, I just want to say this. We'll have both these men back on the show.
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:42.800]  There is a storm coming. The vanguard of it's already hit. There is a great tyranny taking place worldwide.
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:46.800]  And if you notice, it's standardized all over the world. It looks the same. It acts the same.
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:50.800]  It turns the people against each other. It impoverishes.
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:54.800]  It is a planetary world government being established.
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:00.800]  Its main drive is eugenics or reducing population. It comes to kill, seal, and destroy.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:06.800]  Even if you don't believe in the devil, which of course I do, it is the manifestation.
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:15.800]  And humans are manifesting this regardless. This is real. And the preparations for collapse are taking place everywhere.
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:26.800]  This hour of the radio broadcast is brought to you by Secret 12, our proprietary blend of super organic methylcobalamin and one other form of vitamin B12.

[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:38.800]  This is totally absorbable. Sold out for weeks due to difficult proprietary processing, back in stock and limited supply.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:45.800]  With back order within one week of launch. Last shipment until 2015 can take weeks or months for supply to arrive.

[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:45.800]  So I want to thank you all for your support. Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-2533139.
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:48.800]  I'm going to break here just four or five minutes left with each one of you.
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:55.800]  Reverend C.L. Bryan, I can see why you recommended getting Rodney Howard Brown on.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:00.800]  He really speaks with authority. And more importantly, his information is right on target.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:10.800]  And the model of his church, and of course my pastor, Pastor James A. McMinnott, is also the pastor of an interracial church
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:19.800]  in a city like Shreveport, Louisiana, where I'm from, the last city you could see defeat in the Civil War, where old ways die hard.
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:28.800]  You have a church that we preached to over 3,000 people every Sunday. And so I would recommend that you speak with him as well,
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:36.800]  because ministers, pastors, the church is going to have to lead this particular fight.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:44.800]  Men of courage, men who will not back down from the principle, who will not yield to the politics,
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:53.800]  but will stand on the principle of God's word and their personal convictions that are anchored in that word.
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:58:01.800]  That's why Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is a dear friend of mine, and this is why my personal pastor,
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:09.800]  of course I'm the pastor at large around the nation, but my personal pastor, Pastor James A. McMinnott,
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:13.800]  is also someone who has those same convictions.
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:20.800]  Well, it was the church that led the Revolutionary War in 1776, and now the government's come in with face-to-face initiatives
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:24.800]  and the rest of it and taken it over, and that's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:31.800]  That's why they push all this immorality on purpose is to obviously make us servile, mindless and childlike.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:56.800]  We're going to come back with five more minutes with both of you. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:03.800]  Security alert. This is Homeland Security. Analysis, infowars, building independent media operations.
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:08.800]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:10.800]  Prime Directive discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.800]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:16.800]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Infowars.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:19.800]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:20.800]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:23.800]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:29.800]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:33.800]  Block free iPhone app at infowars.com.
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:36.800]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:39.800]  Imperative, destroyed, real planet TV.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:41.800]  You got to set your eye on the enemy.
[01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:44.800]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.800]  Electrally, it's begun. You can fail it.
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:56.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:10.800]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:11.800]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:17.800]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:22.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:26.800]  Revival.com is Pastor Rodney Howard Brown's website.
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:29.800]  CL Bryant.net is Reverend CL Bryant.
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:32.800]  So I can't wait to have him back up when his new book comes out.
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:35.800]  Finishing up and going back to Pastor Brown.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:40.800]  Other points you'd like to add, other things you'd like to say to the people out there.
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:44.800]  When I was in Washington, DC, right after one of the night meetings,
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:47.800]  a man walked up to me and he shook my hand.
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:49.800]  He said, I work for the Federal Reserve.
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:51.800]  So I burst out laughing.
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:54.800]  And then he looked at me and said, everything you're saying is true.
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:56.800]  And I said, well, I know that because I've studied.
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:58.800]  I've got all the books on the whole thing.
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:02.800]  Because I realized when I was a kid growing up in South Africa,
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:05.800]  I always thought to myself, something's wrong with this picture.
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:08.800]  And I just, you know, couldn't really understand.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:11.800]  I got a hold of that book, the same book that you turned on,
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.800]  which was called None They Call It Conspiracy.
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:15.800]  My mom and dad had their books.
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:18.800]  I read that book, but no one really said too much about it.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:23.800]  And then of course I came to America and near we are on the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:28.800]  And I was, I'm just focused on the church and revival and getting everybody back to their first love.
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:33.800]  But about five years ago, the Lord really spoke to me and showed me what's going on.
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:34.800]  It was like a shock to me.
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:38.800]  I actually, Alex, I have to be honest with you, I cried for two days over America.
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:44.800]  I could not believe that the America that I came to know and love is not what it seems.
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.800]  That it's really a facade.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:47.800]  It's like Disney World.
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:50.800]  And it shocked me to the core.
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:56.800]  And I realized that I have to wake the churches up and get the pastors on board and mobilize the people.
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:00.800]  If you can believe it, I'm starting gun clubs in churches.
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:07.800]  So kind of radical, but if we don't have our second amendment, we won't have the first amendment.
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:09.800]  And so I appreciate so much what you're doing.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:11.800]  We want you to know that we pray for you.
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:13.800]  Don't worry about the critics.
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:17.800]  As we always say, the dogs bark, but the caravan keeps moving.
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:23.800]  And the fact of the matter is that a hundred years from today, in eternity, you and I will look at each other
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:27.800]  and we will say we were not quiet and we did not shut up,
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:31.800]  but we were bold to tell the truth and to stand up for what is right.
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:33.800]  And so I salute you, Alec.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:34.800]  No, I salute you.
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.800]  We're all in this together to try to get justice.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:43.800]  And as you pointed out, of the 50-something million people aboard it, half of them are black or more.
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:50.800]  You'll never hear that out of Jesse Jackson's mouth or out of Al Sharpton's race-baiting, evil FBI mouth.
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:53.800]  It's just so sickeningly corrupt.
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.800]  And we just need to alert and warm the people.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:02.800]  And as you said, and as Reverend Bryant said, there is an awakening happening, but the enemy's coming in to try to stop that.
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.800]  And as you said, the globalists are about 15 years behind.
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:06.800]  They're scared.
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:07.800]  They're not invincible.
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:10.800]  Closing comments, Reverend Bryant.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:20.800]  Alex, when 43% of all abortions in this nation are performed by 13% of the population,
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:24.800]  there's something terribly wrong with those figures.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:32.800]  How can black folks be upside down in that type of massacre if there's not a design to it?
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:44.800]  And then how can black people support a party that is, in fact, contributing to the mass genocide of the people?
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:54.800]  And so I encourage everyone to follow me at RevCL Bryant and our website is under construction.
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:04:00.800]  We're about to go syndication with our radio show and love to talk to you about it.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:04.800]  The new movie will be out soon, Red, White and Black.
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:07.800]  If you like runaway slaves, you'll love this.
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:08.800]  Man, I love the names.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:11.800]  I love the names you come up with, but also the content.
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:16.800]  It's so exciting telling you're writing books, you're making films, you're reaching millions of people.
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:18.800]  You are the answer, Mr. Bryant.
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:20.800]  People like you and your spirit.
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:22.800]  And I know this isn't a love fest today.
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:28.800]  It's just that it's exciting for the three of us and all the listeners to think about the fact we're fighting back.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.800]  We're going to have him around.
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:32.800]  We know how the book ends.
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:34.800]  Absolutely.
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:37.800]  Yeah, Alex, one more thing.
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:39.800]  People say, what can I do?
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:41.800]  One woman took prayer out of schools.
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.800]  One person full of the fire of God can make a change in the nation.
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:51.800]  Just like people like John Wesley and what happened in England will be forced.

[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:39.800]  And I've been able to keep it off too.

[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:30.800]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:36.800]  If the government has nothing to hide, are they still afraid to answer a few questions?
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:39.800]  This story does not end up.
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:49.800]  Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:52.800]  I've had a mission to never forget.
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:55.800]  Three thousand people that I've never met.
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:57.800]  We want the madness and all that we get.
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:01.800]  So cut your shit if I don't care.
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:13.800]  Talk about who exposed Lies.
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:18.800]  He was a member of the Council on Crime Relations on some of their boards at the time.
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:26.120]  And he came on my show back in early 2002 and said 9-11 was completely staged.
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:29.560]  The radical Islamic groups were being funded and allowed to operate by our government.
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:32.400]  They've been lied and already been dead that his dead body would be rolled out later as
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:33.400]  a victory.
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:37.680]  Later Walter Cronkite, Secretary of State Madeline Albright and a bunch of others came
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:43.120]  out and seconded what he said in 2004 and said Bush better not roll out the dead body.
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:45.640]  So I guess Obama did it later.
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:50.360]  WikiLeaks' document showed that Pechenik and I were both attacked by Stratford.
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:53.760]  Very upset about the fact that we were saying it wasn't true.
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:56.280]  He got visited by MI6 and a bunch of other people.
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:00.640]  I got visited as well and that was a meeting off record so I'm not going to get into it
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:01.640]  and say by who.
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:07.380]  But I mean this is getting to the point where major agencies, foreign agencies are sending
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:11.920]  people I can go online and there's a famous person coming to see me.
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:16.120]  I mean it's getting to that point where they're sniffing around deciding I guess whether they're
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:18.120]  going to put a bullet in my head or whatever.
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:21.840]  But the good news is the info's already out there.
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:27.120]  You kill me, you just make it that much more popular.
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:29.160]  You kill Pechenik, that happens.
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:32.240]  Now Pechenik, I don't want to call him a slippery cat, he's not like Bill Clinton.
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:36.600]  I think he's an honorable guy, but he is on the inside, the head of psych warfare for
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:40.880]  the State Department that was over all the major agencies, ran the Camp David Accords,
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:42.800]  co-wrote a bunch of books with Tom Clancy.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:46.960]  He is the composite character that the Jack Ryan's based on, produced a bunch of Hollywood
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:47.960]  films as well.
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:54.360]  He's a medical doctor, psychiatrist and was also a bull above captain in the Navy, part
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:59.360]  of a lot of secret operations, part of founding Delta Force and a lot of the audience loves
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:03.600]  him, some of the audience hates him, but you always get interesting information.
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:09.440]  He's got a new book coming out, Steve Pechenik Talks, will certainly be reading that and
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:17.240]  carrying an info or store.com, you can find it at StevePechenik.com and he joins us to
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:18.480]  talk about the torture report.
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:22.080]  I'll tell you my view on the torture.
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:24.960]  I think torture is extremely effective.
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.960]  I don't think it's effective at getting real information, I don't think it's effective
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:34.440]  at winning just wars, I think it's effective at getting fake information, fake false testimonies
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:39.400]  and confessions, terrorizing populations and it's very effective at discrediting everything
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:43.680]  the government does, it's very effective at making you wear the black hat, it's a great
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:47.560]  way to demonize America, part of the globalist program.
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:52.560]  One famous individual said the purpose of torture is not getting information, it's spreading
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:58.320]  fear, Eduardo Galliano and yeah, that's a big part of it as well.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:04.120]  What do you think tasers are with the misuse of them and paying compliance?
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:07.440]  But the reason, yeah, Obama's trying to score points on this right now, they didn't tell
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:12.680]  all I've got is it's still going on, I mean Joe Biggs was a staff sergeant in the Army
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:17.680]  in Afghanistan, Iraq, three tours, happened to have Hastings embedded with him on two
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:21.560]  of those operations and they saw some of the biggest battles out there because Biggs always
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:25.200]  wanted to go where the fighting was and the Army, they'll send you if you want to do that
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:29.640]  and those were written about but he, my point is it's on record, he did the things he says
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:30.640]  he did.
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.520]  One of his big jobs was delivering people for torture, in fact I think we ought to later
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:38.080]  get, I said it earlier, get Biggs in here to talk about torture, he should be on the
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:42.440]  mar, he should be on a lot because he would deliver people for torture and sometimes
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:49.760]  they didn't come out and yes it was there, DEA, FBI, CIA, you name it, it was all about
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:53.960]  drug trade folks, nothing to do with torturing real terrorists, so there are people getting
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.480]  tortured, it's just not for what you think, they got black sites everywhere, Camp X-ray
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:03.440]  has a psychiatric facility within it right by the CIA where they admit they do sexual
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:09.160]  torture, you name it, some of that's in the report, it's testing torture, it's a laboratory
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:14.300]  but not with white lab mice, it's with 14-year-olds, 16-year-olds, you name it, who eight years
[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:19.720]  later get deployed as the heads of ISIS, so I see it as a ground to find the psychological
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:27.520]  candidates to actually be cutouts to lead some of these shadow quack armies like ISIS,
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:33.000]  now that's my view from researching the history, we'll see if former psych warfare chief and
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  you know black ops tricks master, Steve Pachennick agrees or disagrees, that's quite a compending
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.600]  am I just throughout there doc, what do you say?
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:48.360]  What I say is as usual, you're my buddy, you're my friend and I think you're not wrong but
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:55.440]  let me amplify the whole issue why this came out now, you see you and I talked about the
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:01.880]  entire torture a year and a half ago Alex and your audience had a detailed report for
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:10.600]  both you and me during the Boston massacre where exactly the exposure of 6,000 pages
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:18.560]  of torture documents were made by Asa Hutchinson and James Jones implicating Aidan implicating
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:25.880]  Brandon, implicating Bush, implicating Jeb, implicating a whole bunch of people in the
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:30.360]  neocons that we talked about, so this came out in a year and a half ago, the question
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:34.320]  I want to tell your audience and the issue I want to bring up is why was this brought
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:40.360]  up now today and in my opinion it was brought up not because torture has stopped and not
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:46.240]  because it has absolved anybody of anything, on the contrary it continues and the CIA really
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:50.840]  doesn't care, it doesn't care what you think, it doesn't care what I think, it doesn't care
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:53.440]  what the president thinks, why?
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:15:01.120]  Because this exposure by Feinstein is nothing more than an absolution of the Senate Intelligence
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:07.440]  Committee led by Diane Feinstein and Jay Rockefeller, both who were leaving and it's basically
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:12.480]  an absolution to say, oh we didn't know about the torture but eight years later we went
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:17.160]  into detail and they revealed everything that you and I and the audience knew for eight
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:18.160]  years.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:21.200]  So it's a giant butt covering, it's a giant butt covering operation.
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:26.400]  That's the first part, the second part is the issue that you and I started 13 years
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:31.720]  ago and they can't get away from it and the audience knows this and this is a complete
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:37.960]  distraction again from the Osama bin Laden's full story because if you notice what comes
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:44.600]  out in the torture, Jose Rodriguez, this Puerto Rican little, nothing, says yes I'm in charge
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:48.680]  of the torture and I was the one that got the information to get Osama bin Laden.
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:52.840]  We know he was dead, we know that 9-11 was a stand down.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:56.240]  We know the Osama bin Laden's seal rate was nonsense.
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:16:01.640]  We know 0.30 was nonsense so what's coming out again is they're trying for another technique
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:07.760]  that's BIA and the administration Obama because he said he killed Osama bin Laden or he killed
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:12.320]  nobody and the CIA never killed Osama bin Laden because Osama bin Laden was already
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:18.520]  dead under Clinton when Clinton said Dr. Dooley from the CIA to the Dubai hospital.
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:24.120]  So this is another way of getting to the Osama bin Laden story which is another lie.
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:32.400]  In other words, the CIA and the administration, Obama, who is a CIA born and bred product
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:37.680]  of a single mother who was in the CIA, a maternal grandfather and grandfather who were in the
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:44.000]  CIA with a missing father, classical profile of the individual that's recruited by the
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:50.880]  CIA as was Bill Clinton with no father and a single mother, you see this repetitive strain
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:57.000]  of the personality profile, they're absolving Obama and saying in effect yes he killed Osama
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:02.160]  bin Laden and these were the facts that led to Osama bin Laden, all of which are lies.
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:09.400]  So this is again a distraction to absolve the senators to say that Obama really isn't
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:14.640]  the CIA and really did kill Osama bin Laden, we know that's not true where there's a Osama
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:20.360]  bin Laden, we know that's a lie and then on top of that they indicted themselves to avoid
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:25.720]  the very issue of 9-11 and stand down and as you see what they try to do is say oh Bush
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:32.600]  Jr. that moron who knew exactly what he was doing along with Cheney, the most nefarious
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:39.080]  and cowardly of all people because he refused to serve our government 11 times, they basically
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:43.760]  are said that they didn't know about this and so they blame Addington and a bunch of
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:50.080]  their junior people so it makes Bush Jr. look as if he was really a hero coming forth to
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:54.240]  protect the CIA when in fact he was covered by the CIA.
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:18:02.360]  So it avoids the issue of 9-11 then we get down to another indictment that this whole
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:07.680]  drama of the absurd is creating and that is the indictment of media exposition of the
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:14.880]  Anderson Cooper's the fair haired of the young men from Yale who had CIA internships and
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:19.880]  they leaked out information and as you will see in the report they leaked out information
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:24.840]  to the various people on the Washington Post, the New York Times and elsewhere and what
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:29.520]  you're seeing and you'll say to yourself but this sounds crazy and the answer is no.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:36.080]  The CIA is a reptilian organization, it's pretty much like a squid that will lose one arm cut
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:39.600]  off another arm so that it can regenerate again.
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:47.080]  Its only purpose is never to deny its existence but to continue its nefarious existence and
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:53.280]  it will cut off anybody who works with it for it or on it and it doesn't matter whom.
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:58.080]  Whether it's John F. Kennedy, whether it's someone like Nixon who intervenes with it
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:04.320]  because he's not part of it, whether it's a Romney, whether it's a Reagan who was not
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:09.960]  part of it and whether it was Bush who was part of it, whether it was Bill and Hillary
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:15.280]  Clinton both very much steeped in the CIA because they were both at Yale, Bill Clinton
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:20.720]  reported to the CIA when he was in an Oxford scholarship, he denies it but if you vet him
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:26.200]  out and again he's slippery, let's flick Bill, he'll lie all the time.
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:31.800]  He is a CIA operative and an informant as was Hillary, she was on the impeachment committee
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:37.240]  for Nixon, which by definition meant she worked for the CIA, she received the money
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:43.240]  on 9-11 to give to the victims and it's still part of the CIA so this is a way of cleaning
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:49.240]  the deck as well for Jeb Bush to run who is also part of this family of the CIA.
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:52.720]  Alright, Doctor, stay there, we gotta go to break it, riveting stuff, I agree with what
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:20:15.000]  you're saying, it's just prima facie evidence right there, what comes next, stay with us.

[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:04.400]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming
[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:09.400]  irritants, in the absence of enough glutathione your lungs are more prone to irritation, listen

[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:19.720]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien, I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation,
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:23.920]  my breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs, after consuming one
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:29.400]  world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free, I can
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:33.720]  feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pittery
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:38.880]  mark because I rarely get that feeling, being a singer I love feeling this unrestricted voice,
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.880]  the only thing that I've actually added to my routine is one world away, wow.

[02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:15.600]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride, with sword and pistol by my side.
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:27.600]  Many a young maid, lost her bobbles to my trade, many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade.
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:30.600]  We've got Dr. Steve McChenney riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour.

[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:35.760]  or comments.

[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:53.480]  to call in on this Wednesday, the 10th day of December, 2014, 800-259-9231, but we're
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:25:00.840]  just doing quick questions so he can answer and we can move the next person, 800-259-9231.
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:04.760]  We'll briefly talk about his new book coming out, I want to do a whole interview on the
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:10.600]  book in the near future, but before we get to that, I overall agree with what you're
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:15.960]  saying, it makes perfect sense, plus as you said they can inject all the fake narratives
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:25.720]  into a report that exposes them, I just invented a new word that supposedly exposes them, but
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:31.960]  on top of that, at the same time, it's kind of like NSA spying, it's illegal, they deny
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:36.680]  it, it comes out, and then they use the whole process of investigating it to come up with
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:41.080]  solutions that basically codify it and legitimize it.
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:48.200]  Correct, nothing will be done, absolutely this entire report will not even nick the
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:54.120]  CIA's ability to continue to lie, distort and deny and create illegal activity.
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:26:00.000]  All this report did was to absolve Obama from being corrupt and illegal in his war act,
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.480]  it allowed Hillary Clinton to run with the notion that she had nothing to do with 9-11
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:10.240]  and the stand-in, although her husband was involved in rendition along with Sandy Berger,
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:15.760]  and it will clear Jeb Bush's name in the name of his brother, George Bush, who didn't know
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:22.120]  about the 9-11 stand-in and the torture, and in fact will implicate Jeb Bush.
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:26.880]  So really what this has done paradoxically in the narrative is to compound the story
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:33.600]  that you and I first discovered 13 years ago, that all of this is a lie, the 9-11 stand-down
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:40.920]  with in fact a false flag, our own government attacked us, Osama bin Laden was already dead,
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:47.920]  but that story cannot die in Alex because you and I will not allow it to die in the
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:53.920]  American public now, believe 78% to 80% believe that Osama bin Laden was already dead.
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:27:00.120]  They don't believe the SEAL story, they can't believe McRaven, a lying head of a SEAL team,
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:05.000]  and then again the SEAL teams have failed, they've failed time after time and then instead
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  they write reports and then a guy like Jose Rodriguez, the head of the counter-terrorism
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:16.440]  office, goes to Kathy Bigelow, the head of the director of the movie Zero Dog 30 and
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:22.400]  in detail under the direction of John Brennan, gives her a detailed account of a false narrative
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:26.680]  of how they assaulted Osama bin Laden who's already dead.
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:32.160]  Let me shift gears into a couple other subjects just because they're interesting factoids.
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:39.440]  Why do they try to pick fatherless boys for this CIA role?
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:45.480]  Is it the state becomes their father, A, and then B, why don't you ever see the army
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:52.640]  in these Navy SEAL type movies where they're the supermen, I mean, the Navy pushing Navy
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:56.120]  SEALs as God is really starting to get ridiculous.
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:59.800]  Well, you asked two excellent questions, I'll quickly answer.
[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:06.360]  Number one, the fatherless son is a totally absent son, they in fact become the surrogate
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:13.560]  father, they know the son is vulnerable, both Obama or Barry Sorrell and Bill Clinton were
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:19.280]  involved in sex, drugs, and other activity, so that they could be compromised.
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:24.280]  What the CIA always looks for is for a man or a woman who could be easily compromised
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:30.360]  and used at any time and can be indicted or thrown away or neutralized.
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:37.400]  The second part is the army is much more sophisticated under Dempsey and under various other generals,
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:43.120]  the special forces and units added for Bragg and elsewhere have been instructed never to
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:44.120]  speak up.
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:48.480]  The reason why the SEALs have been a failure is because of Admiral Mueller, whose father
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:53.800]  was part of a publicity machinery from the William Morris Agency, Admiral McRaven, who
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:29:00.200]  was a total disaster and was a loudmouth as was Stan McChrystal, these were all narcissists.
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:04.840]  The SEALs were a failure during the Reagan administration, 13 of them died on the way
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:11.160]  to Grenada when I was involved in that false attempt to attack Grenada, and they couldn't
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:17.720]  explain why 13 SEALs drowned on a raft when they were trained to be under water.
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:23.440]  So SEALs have always been a secondary quality and a secondary class of gamesmanship, but
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:28.520]  they've been the first one to run to the movies, run and make movies about themselves, whereas
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:34.680]  the other units out, the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, and other special units that I will
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:40.560]  not get into have never been heard about, will never be heard about, and under General
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:46.040]  Martin Dempsey, they will be under strict commands, but Navy should be reprimanded.
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:49.840]  The Chief Naval Operations Officer should have a demand in their...
[02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:50.840]  Stay there, Dr....
[02:29:50.840 --> 02:29:51.840]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:52.840]  We're gonna come back and run.
[02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:53.840]  We'll come right back with more on that.

[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:18.320]  There's a lot of secret wars going on, aren't there?
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:30.320]  Well, there are, but the key element is the very thing that you and I are using now has become the instrument that CIA and DARPA created in 1973.
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:36.320]  The Internet is the very instrument of destruction for Obama, for Bush, and for Clinton.
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:49.320]  And the reason for that is that you and I have been successful by using the Internet, and now you are speaking to 10 million people, not in New York and in Texas, but all over the world.
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:57.320]  I get responses from all over the world, and I say to all of you out there, you young people and older, we use the Internet.
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:11.320]  If you have to block, hack, or however anonymously you may do it, and I repeat it again, however anonymously you may do it, you can come into these systems and the CIA, because they're very fragile.
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:26.320]  State Department, Treasury, the White House, and you can hack your way around that, and believe me, there will be no bloodshed, because this government is so incompetent that it has no idea of how many people were in the CDC,
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:32.320]  namely 16,000 people at $7 billion who did nothing in Ebola.
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:41.320]  Instead, I had to ask our military and General Dempsey to send 4,000 soldiers of the effort in order to handle Ebola.
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:46.320]  So the only functional capability we have is really the Army.
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:57.320]  I have been compromised by Mueller, it has been compromised by Free, Holy, perhaps it can be turned around by Conley, but I don't think so.
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:09.320]  Obama has been compromised, the White House is compromised, Bush is compromised, Clinton is compromised, so we have to take now the revolution, the Velvet Revolution as you call it,
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:21.320]  and stream it through the electrons right into the White House and to the legislators and the CIA, Department of Defense, the FBI, and hit them with every electronic passion that we have.
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:30.320]  And that is our revolution in America, and the world will follow up, because you are that voice, they listen to you.
[02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:41.320]  The listeners are and my guests are, not me so much, but Dr. Pritchett briefly, why did they send, when the Holben-Laut announcement got made, I know they sent some agencies over to you,
[02:49:41.320 --> 02:49:47.320]  I got some phone calls and then a visit, what is the point of that, just pure intimidation?
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:49.320]  You're afraid, no.
[02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:56.320]  I was about to say they were very nice about it, actually crying uncle, yeah.
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:02.320]  It's this, Alex, you and I have been together kind of informally for a long time.
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:09.320]  In the beginning, they tried to intimidate you and you were kind of a little bit concerned, and then I said, just hold the line.
[02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:18.320]  One thing that doesn't work is intimidation of an American, particularly Americans like you and I, you were born here, I have worked in our government,
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:26.320]  and used techniques on behalf of our government to take down the Soviet Union, to bring peace to Cambodia, to take down the Khmer Rouge.
[02:50:26.320 --> 02:50:29.320]  Now, they know what I'm capable of doing.
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:34.320]  When you use the word slippery, I know what you mean, and I want your audience to understand what I mean.
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:43.320]  I know exactly how our intelligence community works, but I also know how to take it apart piece by piece without even using a bullet.
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:54.320]  They know it, they know that I know it, they know that it can be a disaster if I pull my full force of what I need to do without having to do anything.
[02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:55.320]  All right, stay there, Dr. Progenic.
[02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:58.320]  I want to come back and finish up talking about that straight ahead.
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:14.320]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:51:29.320 --> 02:51:34.320]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you?

[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:31.320]  Thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:41.320]  Hi, Dr. Pachinnick. You being an expert in psychological warfare, I was wondering if you could comment on a story that's on the front page of InfoWars' website,
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:50.320]  which is about these low-flying Apache helicopters and messages being sent down to local citizens on their cell phones.
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:58.320]  Those are the stories on DrudgeReport.com from InfoWars.com. Thousands of cell phone users receive government emergency alert.
[02:54:58.320 --> 02:55:05.320]  Kentucky residents told to prepare for action. We're seeing the massive buildup for domestic takeover. What's happening, Doc?
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:16.320]  Well, I would not take that seriously. What they're basically doing in their attempt is trying to intimidate the audience by fear through sending messages.
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:21.320]  In their sense, they're going to say they're trying to prepare for any kind of emergency.
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:30.320]  But really what they're trying to do is to create incidences of fear, or what we call the Black Hawk helicopters,
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:36.320]  or the Apache flying helicopters, or the hog helicopters coming down at very low flights.
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:41.320]  They monitor, they send out messages, and then they try to intimidate an audience.
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:50.320]  Just ignore it or jam it. If you know how to jam the signal, send it back up and then report it to your local FAA, report it to the local airport.
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:56.320]  Yeah, this is basically a conditioning psi-op like when they went into Panama, they're preconditioning the public for takeover.
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:02.320]  Yeah, it's basically the same thing in 395 Miami Beach.
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:09.320]  They had a whole special ops program right in front of one of my bridges, and they made it look as if this was really very professional.
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:17.320]  The problem is the Army, the Navy, and the CIA had been reading, had been watching too much of their own movies that they created to begin with.
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:26.320]  For the most part, they're not very effective. For the most part, I have used Army and FBI in hostage situations, and they were disaster.
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:33.320]  They could not repel off of the helicopters or rotation. They are not very effective in hostage survival.
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:37.320]  So the reality is very different from the images they want to portray.
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:41.320]  So the images they portray is one of fear and imitation efficiency.
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:45.320]  The reality is that they're a government agency that's totally ineffective.
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:49.320]  Yeah, Mike, psi-op. I mean, what's your take on it, Mike?
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:53.320]  I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure if it was just a...
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:55.320]  It's a conditioning exercise.
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:59.320]  It's massively increasing, and it's also to condition the troops.
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:03.320]  But all it does is condition them to wake up.
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:10.320]  All I'm saying about the military, especially the Army, the most awake group, I mean, they know what's going on.
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:21.320]  The Army has been told repeatedly if they don't stand up and stop this nonsense on behalf of the Navy colleagues and the CIA and other parts of the intelligence community,
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:26.320]  they will be in trouble and they will be denigrated in the eyes of the civilians.
[02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:33.320]  They're repeatedly warned by me and others that they have to stand up and say that's enough, including against the President of the United States.
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:36.320]  But, Michael, it's basically a conditioning exercise.
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:39.320]  And if you want to have fun, take some jamming equipment.
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:41.320]  Stop it. It's the beginning of a revolution.
[02:57:41.320 --> 02:57:44.320]  Mike, in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:49.320]  Yes, Alex. Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:58:00.320]  I was wondering, what are we going to do if it does turn hot? How are we going to get the resources to fight this thing?
[02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:02.320]  Well, I wouldn't be concerned.
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:12.320]  You have to remember that during the Revolutionary War, only 4% of the population of 700,000 men were involved in the actual fighting and combat against the British.
[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:22.320]  In this particular case, the United States government cannot handle the mileage and the distances that occur all over the United States.
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:23.320]  We're too spread out.
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:31.320]  We're too spread out. I live in Florida. Alex lives in Texas. There are people in Montana. We're a few of them, a million people.
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:38.320]  So I would not worry about it. But if I am a Second Amendment believer, I think you should have some of those surprises.
[02:58:38.320 --> 02:58:40.320]  Stay there. Back in one minute.
[02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:45.320]  Stay there, Mike. Stay there, Dr. Pritchett. Come back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:45.320 --> 02:59:11.320]  Some stations leave us now. I bless you all.
[02:59:15.320 --> 02:59:20.320]  We wouldn't be here today. We offer a wonderful online shopping experience.
[02:59:20.320 --> 02:59:26.320]  If you receive a pair that doesn't fit, send them back and we'll exchange them at no cost to you.
[02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:35.320]  Beat the shopping rush by visiting us at Gussett.com and join our email newsletter to receive some great holiday discounts.
[02:59:35.320 --> 02:59:41.320]  And paying no attention to political correctness, Diamond Gussett wants to wish you all a merry Christmas.
[02:59:41.320 --> 02:59:48.320]  Thanks for believing in our dream, the original 100% American made Diamond Gussett gene.
[03:00:12.320 --> 03:00:21.320]  Fix Bayonets. We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:21.320 --> 03:00:26.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:30.320]  Well, Botanic was just saying during the break we got to hang in there. Things are getting hotter.
[03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:37.320]  I think cooler minds are going to prevail. I agree we should have a peaceful infall war revolution against this tyranny.
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:44.320]  But finish up your statement on that. When you say things are getting hotter, I can see the machinery of the establishment trying to move.
[03:00:44.320 --> 03:00:51.320]  But it's mainly just propaganda and turns more people off. If I was trying to turn people off, I would do what they're doing.
[03:00:51.320 --> 03:01:01.320]  But I know they're not in a conspiracy against themselves. Do these arrogant people in government really think they built this whole thing and that they aren't just sitting on top of it?
[03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:11.320]  No, basically the arrogant people in government are not as smart as you think they may be. What's happening and why I'm concerned is that this kind of arrogant exponentially grows.
[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:18.320]  And what happens is they're going to start making mistakes. And when they start making mistakes, they start blaming each other.
[03:01:18.320 --> 03:01:25.320]  And that's what you see happening. You see the legislation burn the CIA. The CIA is burning the White House.
[03:01:25.320 --> 03:01:31.320]  But in turn, what happens is the American public eventually pays for it one way or the other.
[03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:39.320]  So what happens is they become more and more paranoid within the intelligence community and within the security community.
[03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:47.320]  And they start to act out, acting out, meaning they will start another false flag. They'll start another war like ISIS, which is an absolute nonsense,
[03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:57.320]  created by the CIA, used by JSOC again, run by a Navy admiral, where you have guys coming in and out fighting Americans against Americans.
[03:01:57.320 --> 03:02:02.320]  I was about to say, and the Army has to go fight a group run by the Navy. I mean, this is insanity.
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:13.320]  It's not only insanity. This is why your people and the young people of your audience who know, acting, who understand anonymous, these are the ones who become very valuable.
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:24.320]  And these are the ones who are the administration is afraid of them. I can't tell you how fearful they are of your audience out there that knows how to handle computers.
[03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:37.320]  Now, clearly, I can't incite you or instigate you, but I do caution you that if this continues, the absurdity of our civilian theater and the notion that Diane Feinstein didn't know about it,
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:45.320]  Jay Rockefeller didn't know about it. John McCain, he is getting a suit and it's costing us $1.1 trillion.
[03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:54.320]  Let's get a few final quick little questions. The establishment's gone crazy. Bill, you're on the air from Wisconsin. Quick question, please.
[03:02:54.320 --> 03:03:09.320]  Yeah, thanks, Alex. Dr. Projenik, I agree with the 99% of what you have to say, but you seem to whitewash Herbert Walker Bush, and I just can't stomach that.
[03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:11.320]  I'm not one of the young boys.
[03:03:11.320 --> 03:03:25.320]  I won't whitewash him. What I said is his only contribution was to help in the takedown of the Soviet Union, Cambodia Peace Conference, the rest. I do not whitewash. He has approved George Chubb Bush Jr.
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:30.320]  He has approved Jeff. He's approved Neil, who's been a corrupt individual.
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:32.320]  Well, there's your answer, Bill.
[03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:37.320]  Thank you, Bill. We're not cutting you off just out of time. Michael and Louisiana, go ahead.
[03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:55.320]  Yes, gentlemen. In March and August of 2013, there is a case going to court, Shelley versus Bush, that was going to put the entire Bush administration in jail on the Nuremberg trial precepts.
[03:03:55.320 --> 03:04:13.320]  So Obama stepped in and had that case quashed and then went to the courts to seek immunity for the entire Bush administration. I'd like to know how this case fits in with the recent release of the torture memos.
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:16.320]  Well, I don't know the case. I don't know. Projenik does.
[03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:25.320]  The only thing I would suggest is that's correct. Domestically, the president gave everybody immunity, but in reality, you have to take it to the International Hague Court.
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:34.320]  Any time any of these individuals, the Bushes, leave the United States, they can be in prison. Henry Kissinger knew that. Michael Hayden knows that.
[03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:40.320]  That's right. These people aren't invincible. They aren't invincible. And we need to let them know that the people are aware and awake.
[03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:47.320]  Projenik, thank you so much. Have a great holiday coming up. And we'll talk to you for sure, Lord Willing, in the New Year.
[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:48.320]  Thank you.
[03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:49.320]  All right, folks.
[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:50.320]  My question. Thank you and God bless you.
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:51.320]  Thank you. God bless you, too.
[03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:54.320]  Now, we're going to go to break here. Come back and retransmission.
[03:04:54.320 --> 03:04:56.320]  Natalie News Tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:04:56.320 --> 03:05:11.320]  Pray for liberty. Pray for freedom. Pray with the First Amendment.
